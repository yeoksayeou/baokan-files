### Information and Public Opinion

Both information and public opinion serve as the eyes and ears of the government, used as references for deciding national policies and implementing measures. However, information is gathered by the government through a relatively extensive and rigorous organization, according to a certain plan, collecting reports on various aspects of people's words, actions, and movements from the public to the government authorities. Public opinion, on the other hand, is the expression by various segments of the population, through tangible means (such as newspapers and magazines) and intangible means (such as oral transmission), of their emotions of joy, anger, sorrow, and resentment toward politics and the real environment, and the presentation of various hopes and demands. Therefore, generally speaking, public opinion is the most genuine and should not be taken lightly. Conversely, government information, because it is gathered by designated special individuals, inevitably has limitations in perception, ability, obscured interests, and untruthful judgments. As a result, the accuracy of the information obtained often contradicts the actual situation. If policymakers blindly take it as a guiding principle for implementing policies, it often leads to extremely bad consequences. Therefore, when we review historical facts from ancient times to the present, both in China and abroad, all good and enlightened governments value public opinion and regard the support or opposition of public opinion as a guiding principle for implementing policies. As a result, the policies of such governments inevitably gain the support of the entire nation, the government is consolidated, and the country is secured. Conversely, governments that violate the spirit of benevolent governance do not value public opinion but instead fear it. At that time, they only value information, and as a result, right and wrong are indistinguishable, good and evil are reversed, and virtuous and loyal people become enemies, while sycophantic and flattering individuals, those who harm the country and the people, are able to live in peace, wealth, and honor, and the country is in danger, making it impossible to achieve anything.

We are not saying that information is entirely unnecessary. No, information has its uses, especially in this great war involving national characteristics. Not only should we find ways to obtain information about the enemy, but we must also prevent the enemy from spying on us. However, the work has various limitations in time and space, especially in China. Not to mention the Japanese authorities in China, even the Chinese authorities themselves must pay serious attention to these limitations when implementing intelligence work. The main points are: First, China has always advocated the rule of benevolence, and intelligence work has not been valued. Not only do ordinary people lack this knowledge, but the authorities have also never understood the true meaning of intelligence. Therefore, it is not easy to find fully suitable intelligence officers in China. If those who do not have a correct understanding of the duties of an intelligence officer serve as intelligence officers, the danger is truly unimaginable. Second, under the influence of Confucianism for thousands of years, the Chinese people have always regarded "concealing evil and promoting good" as the minimum moral standard for upright gentlemen. Conversely, a group of sycophantic petty people do not know what "morality" is at all and only know how to be selfish and self-serving. As long as it helps to increase their own interests and benefits, they will not hesitate to slander the good and entrap the virtuous. On the one hand, good people do not care about worldly affairs, and on the other hand, evil people wantonly commit sins. Gentlemen are in despair, and petty people rise. The root cause of the corruption and darkness of Chinese politics for thousands of years may lie in this. Therefore, when implementing intelligence work in such a society, one must particularly heighten one's vigilance because if one is not careful, one will provide bad people with opportunities to do evil, which is of no benefit to the work itself.

Overly valuing intelligence work and ultimately creating hatred between the government authorities and the people is most clearly exemplified by the Chongqing regime. In order to value intelligence work and control public opinion, the Chongqing regime established a strict intelligence system and secret service organization, spreading intelligence networks not only in various provinces and cities. The strictness of the intelligence network can be said to be unparalleled. Every person who hears the words "intelligence" and "secret service" turns pale at the mention of them. However, what was the result? First, it created widespread fear among the people, increasing their misunderstanding and resentment towards the government. Second, all government and civilian organizations, due to the existence of intelligence and secret service networks, relaxed their own work, and everyone perfunctorily tried to avoid responsibility, fearing that if they worked seriously, they would become targets of intelligence officers. Third, due to the jealousy and hatred of talent by intelligence officers, most of the energetic and promising government cadres and experts from all walks of life were framed, imprisoned, and unjustly died, leaving only mediocre people who said "yes" to everything and slaves who flattered and fawned on the government. Fourth, because intelligence personnel had powers that surpassed everything, they often took advantage of opportunities to engage in corruption, bribery, and harm the loyal and good. From this, it can be seen what serious consequences result from the misuse of intelligence work.

When implementing intelligence work in China, the disastrous defeat of the Chongqing regime and the evil consequences it suffered must be given serious attention. We believe that the Japanese authorities in China should seriously review the actual situation and results of intelligence work, and what should be particularly valued is: (1) All intelligence personnel must be selected for their sound character, knowledge, and morality. Only through strict selection can the effectiveness of their work be guaranteed. (2) All intelligence personnel must undergo thorough political training so that they have a full understanding of the general political situation and their own tasks, especially a belief in their own morality and character, and a noble feeling for their work. (3) Due to the special circumstances of China, each piece of intelligence must be given sufficient time to judge its degree of accuracy, and it is not permissible to believe it to be true as soon as it is obtained and act on it rashly, because the policy of "rather wrong than let go" has already been implemented by the Chongqing regime and has been disastrously defeated. (4) When conducting investigations and arrests of Chinese people or their groups based on intelligence that is determined to be accurate, it is necessary to avoid implicating the innocent as much as possible and to promptly conduct legal trials. (5) Those who provide false intelligence should be severely punished. In addition, the policy of "no blame for past offenses" should be seriously implemented. If a certain piece of intelligence involves a certain person's or group's past thoughts and actions, even if it is considered accurate, it should not be dealt with. This lenient policy is directly beneficial to the Chinese people and indirectly helps Japan itself.

In addition to these necessary attentions for intelligence work, we sincerely hope that the Japanese authorities will adapt to China's historical environment and current situation, not adopt the concept of "intelligence is omnipotent," pay attention to public opinion, cultivate public opinion among the people, reverse the Chongqing regime's policy of suppression, and open up benign criticism and the expression of public sentiment. Because only public opinion is the most loyal ears and eyes of the government, only genuine public opinion can supplement what intelligence does not cover and remedy the drawbacks of intelligence, thereby helping the implementation of good policies.

### A Casual Discussion on the Tunisian War Translated from the Osaka News of December 21st

(Question) Solomon is in the East, Tunisia is in the West, and most people think that these are the two major focal points facing the world. What is the situation of the North African war?

(Answer) The American troops that have landed have seven divisions, a total of 140,000 men, and are continuously arriving from Algiers and various ports in Libya. British and American troops are still setting off. Therefore, the total number of American and British troops attacking Tunisia with all their strength should indeed be quite considerable. In response to this, the German-Italian Axis forces are constantly transporting tanks and infantry to Tunisia. At the same time, reinforcements are continuously arriving from Sicily and Sardinia. Various key points near the border have been fully deployed, and in cooperation with the French garrison, a defensive position like an iron wall has been formed, and a large-scale encounter battle with the American and British forces is unfolding. Of course, it is currently in a so-called advance-and-retreat phase, far from reaching the decisive line, but there is a view that the focus of the European War has shifted here.

(Question) I am a little worried: Aren't the Axis countries gradually being drawn into a difficult "short-term war of attrition" here? What is your opinion?

(Answer) Since the opponent is the United States, this is probably inevitable. In Egypt, the United States has set up equipment factories, and a large number of aircraft are being manufactured. Somewhere in West Africa, aircraft factories have also been established. In short, they are devoting all their efforts to promoting material strength and productivity, intending to defeat Germany and Italy without a fight in the "competition of things." On the other hand, the American and British army's supply lines are constantly being bombed by the concentrated German air force because they are too long, and transport ships from the United States are also constantly being attacked by Axis submarines, so the American and British armies can be said to have encountered great difficulties. However, the German and Italian sides are also not allowed to be optimistic. The United States and Britain are willing to make any sacrifices in order to seize control of the Mediterranean Sea. What they are complacent about is building a second front on the European continent. Negligence and relaxation are great taboos for the Axis powers.

(Question) People generally call this the second front, but didn't Stalin say on Revolution Day that "the second front is limited to the European continent," and deny the notion of North Africa as the second front?

(Answer) The United States also stated when it landed that "this is not the second front," but no matter how cunning Roosevelt is, he eventually announced something like "that is the second front." In the meantime, the United States and Britain put in a lot of thought. That is to say, if this is called the second front, it is easier to talk to the Soviet Union. That being said, it is actually a complete invasion by American and British imperialism. That is: Roosevelt wants to realize his long-cherished dream of a Jewish economic empire here. Recently, there have been rumors that a Jewish empire is to be built here. No wind makes no waves, and this may be based on something.

(Question) The Tergol and Darlan regimes have the same situation and the same goals, and should cooperate with each other, but now they are actually disagreeing. The reason is probably here.

(Answer) Yes. To put it bluntly, the American puppet government is the Darlan regime (Translator's note: Darlan has now been assassinated), while the British initially controlled the Tergol regime. Therefore, they incited the Tergol faction to oppose the Darlan regime. From this, we can see the opposition between the United States and Britain in North African political work.

(Question) With such infighting occurring frequently, the landing and reinforcement troops of the enemy will be annihilated one by one due to the fierce bombing of the Axis forces. Is that so?

(Answer) Working side by side with the French garrison, such a battle result will definitely be achieved. In the future, it will gradually enter a long-term war. (Translated by Hui)

Regarding the current situation, I have had several earnest talks with the officials of the government authorities. Our opinions are harmonious, and there has been further development in strengthening the National Government and cooperating in the Greater East Asia War. I am deeply gratified.'"

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) Since the Chairman and President of the Executive Yuan of the National Government arrived in Japan on the 20th, he paid a visit to His Majesty the Emperor on the 22nd. He then exchanged opinions with Prime Minister Tojo on consecutive days, and everything went quite smoothly. At 10:00 AM on the 26th, he and his entourage took a special aircraft, the Haiyan, from the airport here to return to the country. Prime Minister Tojo and other ministers attended the opening ceremony of the 81st Diet on the morning of the same day, so they all went to the guesthouse in the morning before Chairman Wang set off to see him off. Others who went to the airport to see him off included Vice Minister Kimura of the Ministry of the Army, Vice Minister Matsumoto of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Director Yamamoto of the Greater East Asia Ministry, Heiji Chikiichiro, Ambassador Shigemitsu to China, newly appointed Ambassador to Italy Hidaka, Director-General of Aviation Dohihara, and our country's Ambassador to Japan Xu.

Nanjing, 27th (Central News Agency) Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the situation in East Asia has rapidly unfolded, and the foundation for victory has also been laid. In order to directly exchange opinions with the Japanese government authorities, strengthen the National Government, and complete the Greater East Asia War, the Chairman and President of the Executive Yuan of the National Government, accompanied by Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance Zhou Fohai and other entourage members, took the Haiyan special aircraft to Japan at 10:00 AM on the 19th of this month. After arriving in Japan, he paid a visit to the Japanese Emperor on the 22nd. From the 23rd onwards, he met with Prime Minister Tojo and ministers of the Army, Navy, Foreign Affairs, and Greater East Asia, as well as various other parties from the government and the public, in his capacity as President of the Executive Yuan. He exchanged opinions with various parties on issues such as close cooperation between China and Japan and achieved satisfactory results. Therefore, at 10:30 AM on the 27th, he returned to Nanjing from Fukuoka on the Haiyan special aircraft. At 3:40 PM, he safely arrived at the capital's airport. The ministers of various yuan who arrived to welcome him at the time included Wen Zongyao, Jiang Kanghu, Chen Qun, Chen Chunpu, Chen Junhui, Xu Suzhou, Su Chengde, Deng Zuyu, Ren Yuandao, Ye Peng, and foreign guests, including Ambassador Lu Ronghuan of Manchukuo, Ambassador Starmer of Germany, a representative of the Italian Ambassador, and Chief of Staff Kawato of Japan, totaling over a hundred people. At 3:30 PM, the silhouette of the aircraft was seen appearing in the eastern sky. The welcoming personnel at the scene all smiled and craned their necks in anticipation. A moment later, the dark green Haiyan aircraft flew to the top of the sky and circled over the airport for a week before slowly landing at 3:40 PM. The welcoming personnel immediately raised their hats to welcome him. Then, the aircraft door opened, and the Chairman, dressed in a black formal suit and full of vigor, slowly descended from the aircraft amidst the loud military music. Entourage members Chu Minyi, Lin Baisheng, Xiao Shuxuan, Zhou Longxiang, Chen Changzu, and Navy Advisor Teraoka followed suit. After getting off the aircraft, the Chairman smiled and nodded frequently to the welcomers. At 3:50 PM, the Chairman and all the entourage members finally took a car back to their residences to rest.

Fukuoka, 27th (Central News Agency) The Chairman and President of the Executive Yuan of the National Government went to Japan on the 20th and exchanged opinions with the Japanese government authorities for consecutive days. On the morning of the 26th, he left Tokyo with his entourage members Chu Minyi, Lin Baisheng, Xiao Shuyi, Chen Changzu, and others, as well as the military advisor of the National Government, Navy Rear Admiral Teraoka, on a special aircraft. After spending one night in Fukuoka en route, he safely arrived in Nanjing at 3:40 PM on the 27th.

Nanjing, 27th (Domei News Agency) After Chairman Wang's visit to Japan and return to the country, it is heard that the National Government is now re-adjusting its administrative and military organs in accordance with the basic policy of cooperation with Japan and conducting the Greater East Asia War. Regarding this matter, Chairman Wang's visit to Tokyo this time can be said to be a turning point for closer cooperation between China and Japan in carrying out the war. Judging from the current situation, it is not difficult to imagine that the National Government will adjust its military and political organs based on the complete unity of all political parties. According to political observers here, the specific adjustment plan will be drafted by Minister of Finance Zhou Fohai and Minister Mei Siping. It is expected that this reorganization will expand to political and economic aspects, with three goals: to strengthen the administrative power of the National Government, increase productivity, and raise the standard of wartime life for the Chinese people. The adjustment plan is expected to affect China's financial institutions, the rural pacification movement, national policy companies, and the utilization of enemy-managed factories.

Minister Lin and Others Express Their Thoughts on Chairman Wang's Visit to Japan

Nanjing, 27th (Central News Agency) After Chairman Wang returned to Beijing on the afternoon of the 27th, Minister Lin of the Propaganda Department and Information Minister Yofu of the Japanese Embassy specially held a joint reception for Chinese and foreign journalists at the Propaganda Department's press room to express their thoughts on Chairman Wang's visit to Japan.

Minister Lin said in his speech that he accompanied the Chairman to Japan this time and had expressed his feelings, which were published in the newspapers. He also had something to tell you all. Today is December 27th, and the day after tomorrow is the 29th, which is the fourth anniversary of the Telegraphic Message. On the occasion of the fourth anniversary of this Telegraphic Message, the guiding force of the Telegraphic Message has made the situation develop further. Not only is He Yun's comrade pleased, but he will also work even harder to lead the people of the country to endure hardship and strive to realize their own goals. Some of you may ask where the so-called development of the situation lies. I solemnly tell you, the iron front formed by the East Asian people and East Asian comrades has become stronger and stronger. The great power exerted by this strong front will allow us to witness the final destruction of the enemies of East Asia and the final annihilation of the rebels of East Asia in the 32nd year of the Republic of China. We hold this spirit to celebrate the fourth anniversary of the Telegraphic Message and the 32nd year of the Republic of China.

Information Minister Yofu of the Japanese Embassy in Nanjing gave a speech at the Propaganda Department on the 27th after Chairman Wang returned from Japan and met with reporters. Chairman Wang was pleased to return from Japan this time. This visit by the Chairman has made the relationship between China and Japan closer and more cooperative, and is moving towards the path of completing the Greater East Asia War. What kind of assistance has Yufang recently given to the United States and Britain to make various necessary struggles? And what has the United States and Britain shown to them? This is really a great insult to China by Yufang. The Chinese will demand that the United States revise the immigration law containing anti-Chinese connotations, but the result is rejected. The United States incorporates Chinese people into the army and sends them to the front lines in Europe and the South Pacific to fight, using the blood and flesh of the Chinese people to exchange for their own delusions of victory. During the First World War, the Americans incorporated Chinese people into the army and sent them to the European battlefield. Britain also organized the Indian army and falsely promised to give the Indians independence and freedom after the war as a price. But at the beginning of the war, they needed the Indians, and now they have turned a blind eye to India's independence. Now, the most cruel thing that Britain does is to use all kinds of inhumane and forceful suppression against the Indian independence movement. This time, the United States is driving the Chinese to fight, and is giving them a blank check as a reward, allowing them to revise the immigration law after the war. Britain's tactics against India are really poisonous. Britain puts the Yujun in the front line on the Burmese front, so the corpses abandoned on the battlefield are all Chinese. This kind of fact is still in the deep memory of the world. It is impossible to make countries with such different races and civilizations cooperate with each other. Even if they cooperate for a while, it is only for their own interests, and there is no possibility of permanence. It is gratifying that China and Japan, with the same script and the same race, are moving towards the common goal of protecting East Asia in a natural posture. Looking back at Yufang's repeated exploitation by the United States and Britain, we feel even more that the path of cooperation between China and Japan is correct and beyond doubt.

### The Greater East Asia War Now Enters Its Second Stage - Japanese Prime Minister Addresses Parliament on the War Situation, Hoping the Entire Nation Will Exert Greater Effort

Tokyo, 27th (Domei News Agency) - Prime Minister Tojo, in his capacity as Minister of the Army, addressed both houses of the Imperial Diet this afternoon, stating that the first stage of the Greater East Asia War, characterized by lightning-fast surprise attacks, has now passed and become a protracted affair. The enemy, initially suffering bitter defeats, is now striving to reorganize its military strength. Their apparent plan involves recapturing Japanese-occupied territories, increasing their air force stationed in China, and launching counter-offensives in the Solomon Islands, New Guinea, and the Aleutian Islands. Close observation reveals that extremely important strategies are taking shape in various locations, creating the impression that "the real war will now begin."

The Prime Minister reported on the war situation in various regions, outlining that the Japanese Army's operations over the past year can be divided into two phases. The first phase involved lightning warfare resulting in the capture of Hong Kong, Singapore, Corregidor, and the pacification of Java, the Philippines, and Burma. The latter phase saw the fighting become more stubborn and intense, entering a phase of full-scale combat. Despite repeated defeats, the enemy relies on its abundant material resources to expand its military strength, attempting to recover our southern occupied territories, strengthen its air force in Chongqing, and counter-attack in the Solomon Islands, New Guinea, and the Aleutian Islands. Therefore, close observation reveals that operations of great significance continue to unfold in various aspects.

(1) Southern Regions

Regarding Burma, the enemy has a total of 100,000 troops, including those from British India, and 600 aircraft, with the strength seemingly continuing to increase. The Japanese Army in Burma is not only in contact with the enemy on the western border, but also confronting over ten divisions of the Chongqing army in the Nujiang River area in the northeast. The British and American air forces, using eastern India and Yunnan as bases, attack daily with dozens of aircraft, but the Japanese army has repeatedly repelled them. Joint large formations of fighters and bombers have attacked enemy bases, inflicting heavy damage. On October 25th, the Japanese air force attacked Chimgaga and Chittagong in the western Burmese-Indian border region, shooting down over forty enemy aircraft. On December 5th and 10th, they again launched a fierce attack on Chittagong, destroying over ten enemy aircraft, sinking over twenty enemy ships, and dropping heavy bombs on stations and military facilities. On the 15th and 16th, they attacked Chittagong and Feni airfield, destroying over twenty enemy aircraft. Since the 20th of this month, they have also repeatedly bombed Calcutta, achieving results exceeding expectations. Meanwhile, security in Burma has improved since the establishment of the new administrative agencies, and the Burmese Defense Army, organized by Burma, has been completed. Japanese strength is very strong. In Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaya, Java, Sumatra, and Borneo, Japanese units, except for a portion in the Philippines still engaged in suppression operations, have secured peace and order. In the Solomon Islands, the small Japanese naval units that occupied Guadalcanal Island were heavily attacked by the US military in early August of this year. The Japanese army immediately cooperated closely with the navy, implementing landings and overcoming all kinds of difficulties in transportation, landing supplies, and sanitation. They are currently confronting enemy forces. The enemy forces in that area have air bases, making Japanese landings and maritime transport not easy, but they are still able to conduct integrated land and sea operations.

(2) China Front

The Japanese Expeditionary Force in China has constructed a long front throughout China, launching annihilation warfare against three million Chongqing troops and six hundred thousand communist troops at any time, destroying their combat power, and ensuring peace and order in various places. The main operations include the Zhejiang-Jiangxi operation in Central China, as well as operations in various regions of South China, North China, and Inner Mongolia. The total number of operations reached 250. The military supplies and other war spoils captured by the Japanese army are substantial. Regarding the US Air Force in Chongqing and the remaining Chongqing air force, they have a total of about 300 aircraft. Since June, they have been conducting guerrilla warfare in North China, Central China, and South China, but our side has suffered very little damage. The Japanese army has also repeatedly reduced the Chongqing air force bases in Zhejiang and Fujian provinces, or repeatedly attacked the mobile air bases of the Chongqing side, inflicting heavy blows and suppressing their movements. Therefore, the US Air Force in Chongqing is now avoiding fighting the Japanese Air Force.

(3) Northern Region

The Aleutian Islands are an important enemy offensive point. On June 8th of this year, the Japanese army and navy, in cooperation, landed successively on several islands in the western region, securing those locations and suppressing their attacks. As for Manchuria, they are also on guard day and night, conducting active training, in order to solidify the north amidst the ever-changing world situation, and lay the foundation for the complete prosecution of the Greater East Asia War.

(4) Economic Development

Military administration in the southern occupied territories is now progressing smoothly. Administrative agencies have been generally established, and necessary personnel have been continuously dispatched. They are currently launching the military administration and construction. The residents of various places deeply understand Japan's true intentions and are grateful for the meaning of breaking free from the shackles of Britain, America, and the Netherlands to build a new order in Greater East Asia. They are willing to share weal and woe with Japan and cooperate. As for economic development, the goal is to obtain important resources for national defense. Most of the important resources that were destroyed by the war have been restored, which is of great benefit to enhancing the combat power of the Japanese army. Resources such as gasoline, bauxite, iron ore, tungsten ore, and tin ore have already yielded great gains. The production of copper and lead mines has also reached the production quantities expected by Japan's resource mobilization. As for agricultural and forestry resources, the South is a world-renowned treasure trove, not only producing enough food to meet the needs of the entire Greater East Asia, but also having a monopoly on the production of rubber, quinine, Manila hemp, and coconuts in the world market. Regarding the transportation of materials, they have made every effort to use army transport vessels. By the end of October, the total amount of materials transported had reached more than 1.8 million tons, and it is expected to exceed the planned tonnage by seventeen times within a year.

The above is a general description of the situation under the jurisdiction of the military administration agencies in various occupied areas. The military, government, and civilians need to devote their full efforts and cooperate most closely with each other. The overall results of the war and the damage suffered by the Imperial Japanese Army in the past year of the war have been announced by the Imperial General Headquarters on December 7th, so there is no need to elaborate today. Prime Minister Tojo concluded his report by saying, "I would like to sincerely state that the Japanese Army, under the Emperor's authority, is cooperating closely with the Navy and receiving the enthusiastic support of the 100 million people of the Japanese Empire, has established a strategic position of certain final victory."

### Navy Minister Shimada Reports on Naval Achievements

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Navy Minister Shimada reported on the naval battles since May of this year at the 81st Diet session on the 27th. The general outline is as follows: From the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War to mid-May of this year, after repeated naval battles, the strategic strongholds in the Western Pacific and the major areas in the South Seas have all fallen into our hands, establishing a very favorable foundation for combat. Recently, naval units have cooperated closely with the army, actively implementing combat, and constantly pursuing the defeated enemy, in order to destroy them. The current war has expanded to extremely distant regions, and its scale is also quite large. It can be roughly divided into three: (1) Operations in the Indian Ocean; (2) Operations in the Australian region; (3) Operations in the Pacific region. Regarding the Indian Ocean, our army has established a solid foundation by occupying Burma, the Andaman Islands, the Nicobar Islands, and Sumatra, making the war easier to conduct. Naval units searched for remnants of the enemy, from the Indian Ocean to as far as South Africa. For example, on May 31st, a special submarine force raided Diego Suarez, an important port at the northern tip of Madagascar, destroying a British battleship of the Elizabeth class and a cruiser of the Amos-class, giving the enemy a great shock. In total, our submarines sank 35 enemy ships, approximately 270,000 tons, in the Indian Ocean and South Africa. Regarding the Australian region, our naval units, with powerful air forces, have continuously bombed key locations on its west coast, such as Darwin, and on July 30th, bombed Port Hedland, a key hub in the central west coast, destroying the enemy's air force and destroying its ships and military facilities. During this period, they also bombed Aru Island, Kai Island, and Tanimbar Island in the Arafura Sea. During this period, our naval units have consistently conducted lively operations in New Guinea and the eastern coast of Australia. The bombings of Port Moresby and Townsville in northern Australia were the most intense. In total, the damage suffered by the enemy during this period, including the New Britain area, has reached 905 aircraft shot down and destroyed. The severity of the damage is self-evident. At sea, we have consistently used submarines and other forces to conduct operations in the waters near Australia, either destroying enemy transportation lines or disrupting their rear, all of which have yielded great results. For example, on May 31st, our special submarines broke into Sydney Harbor, sinking an enemy warship. The enemy's losses were very great. Regarding the Pacific Ocean, our naval units have consistently pursued the remnants of the enemy in various parts of the Pacific Ocean leading to the United States mainland, in order to destroy them. During this period, all important naval battles almost all occurred in that area. We have used powerful forces to raid key locations that the enemy regarded as forward bases, such as Dutch Harbor in the Aleutian Islands and Midway Island in the Hawaiian Islands. The enemy's forces and bases have been heavily damaged. On June 4th and 5th, our powerful naval forces braved severe weather and continuously bombed Dutch Harbor and the surrounding islands, heavily damaging enemy airfields, ships, and important military facilities. At the same time, when our naval forces launched a large-scale attack on Midway Island, they fiercely attacked the American fleet that was heading to reinforce that area. The decisive naval battle was quite fierce. Our side lost one aircraft carrier, and one aircraft carrier and one cruiser were destroyed, and 35 aircraft were lost. However, our side sank three American ships, the aircraft carrier USS Yorktown and one large cruiser and one submarine, and shot down 105 of their aircraft. This time, the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise was also heavily damaged, and important military facilities were destroyed. Later, on June 7th, our navy occupied Kiska Island, an important western stronghold in the Aleutian Islands, and on the 8th, occupied Attu Island at its western end. These islands are important strongholds in the northern Pacific, with important strategic positions. Also, some of our submarines have operated far off the Pacific coast of the United States, either disrupting enemy sea lanes or attacking their important bases. Now, I will briefly report on the situation of the most intense South Pacific operations. The importance of that area has increased since our army occupied the Solomon Islands, making the enemy deeply uneasy. The enemy and I had a so-called Battle of the Coral Sea in early May. On August 7th, the enemy launched a large-scale counter-offensive against the southern end of the Solomon Islands, the tip of our occupied territories. A powerful British-American joint fleet and more than ten transport ships invaded Tulagi and Guadalcanal. Our naval units immediately confronted them. From August 7th to 9th, our naval air force continuously carried out bombings, and the naval units boldly entered the enemy's ranks at midnight on the 8th, carrying out night battles. In this battle, we sank a total of 35 British and American cruisers (13) and destroyers (22), and heavily damaged other ships and aircraft, reaping great results. This is the so-called First Battle of the Solomon Sea. Our side's losses in this battle were very small, only 21 aircraft and two cruisers slightly damaged. This operation was the enemy's first large-scale counter-offensive. Since the enemy's naval forces were severely damaged, and their land forces landed on Tulagi and Guadalcanal, confronting our garrison, and the enemy's air force also participated in the battle, the subsequent battles between us in the vicinity became more intense, and large and small naval battles occurred repeatedly. For example, on the night of August 17th, an American surprise attack force came to attack Maiana Island, the northern end of the Gilbert Islands occupied by us. About 200 American troops successfully landed, but were immediately completely repelled by our garrison. Subsequently, our powerful forces engaged in the Second Battle of the Solomon Islands in the sea east of the Solomon Islands on August 24th. In the following two months, large and small battles continued to occur in that area. During that time, our side sank the American aircraft carrier USS Wasp, three cruisers, and a total of 22 other enemy ships, and shot down and destroyed 519 aircraft. In addition, many enemy battleships and aircraft carriers were destroyed, reaping great results. Our losses were two cruisers, two destroyers, one submarine, five transport ships, and 135 aircraft. After repeated defeats, the enemy was overwhelmed with frustration. In order to reverse the decline, they used their remaining forces to move north of the Santa Cruz Islands in late October. As a result, the Battle of the South Pacific occurred on October 26th. Our fleet fiercely attacked the enemy from dawn to night on that day, and after a day of fierce fighting, we sank one enemy battleship, three aircraft carriers, three cruisers, and one destroyer, for a total of eight ships, and heavily damaged six other ships and shot down more than 200 enemy aircraft. Our side only had two aircraft carriers and one cruiser slightly damaged. Although the enemy fleet was severely defeated, they still used their rear-area base at close range to repeatedly force reinforcements and supplies to the landing forces on Guadalcanal. We also took the opportunity to counterattack, and the Third Battle of the Solomon Sea and the Battle of Lunga Point occurred successively on the 11th. From November 12th to 14th, enemy ships appeared one after another in the Guadalcanal area. Our fleet attacked them day and night. On the night of the 14th, they attacked a powerful enemy reinforcement force northwest of Guadalcanal. After a fierce battle, we sank two enemy battleships, eleven cruisers, and many other ships and aircraft. Our side lost one battleship, one cruiser, and three destroyers, and one battleship was damaged. Our battleships attacked enemy ship formations at night with supporting units, destroying enemy ships, causing our battleships to be the first to be sacrificed since the start of the war, suffering concentrated attacks from enemy forces. Next, on the night of November 30th, our mine warfare unit attacked a powerful enemy fleet again in the sea off Lunga Point on Guadalcanal Island. After a magnificent night battle, we sank one enemy battleship and one Augusta-class cruiser and two destroyers, demonstrating the power of our night battle unit. As such, our navy's operations in the South Pacific are proceeding favorably, and our side has repeatedly reaped great results. Although we have also suffered some losses, the naval units have consistently cooperated closely with the army, courageously advancing to complete the combat objectives. In addition to the larger operations mentioned above, the Japanese Navy has also undertaken important tasks in other regions, dividing land and sea responsibilities, actually conducting operations, and making the strategic situation occupied by the Empire more and more solid. Here, I will once again state the overall results obtained by our navy in the year since the start of the war. We have sunk 11 enemy battleships, 11 aircraft carriers (including one seaplane carrier), 46 cruisers, 48 destroyers, 13 submarines, and 54 other ships. Not counting other ships, a total of 1.1 million tons of warships were sunk, accounting for 38 percent of the total strength of the British, American, and Soviet navies before the war. In addition, 9 battleships, 4 aircraft carriers, 19 cruisers, 23 destroyers, 60 submarines, and 39 other ships were heavily damaged. Also, 424 merchant ships were sunk and destroyed, totaling 2.27 million tons. 9 warships and 503 merchant ships were captured, approximately 220,000 tons. 3,853 aircraft were shot down and destroyed. All of this has caused enormous damage to the enemy. Although the enemy authorities are doing their best to conceal it from their people, the depth of the blow can already be seen from this. As for our navy's losses, there have been 1 battleship, 3 aircraft carriers, 4 cruisers, 15 destroyers, 9 submarines, and 20 other ships, as well as 65 naval-related ships of 200,000 tons, and 568 aircraft. The damaged ships include 1 battleship, 2 aircraft carriers, 3 cruisers, 9 destroyers, 1 submarine, and 10 other ships. Now that the war situation has reached the decisive stage, our naval officers and soldiers, with the sincere assistance of the people, have an increasingly high morale. With the belief of certain victory, we will overcome any difficulties, annihilate the enemy, and complete the final objective of the war.

### German Troops on the Eastern Front Hold Their Ground - Soviet Winter Offensive Ineffective - Fierce Fighting Continues in the Don River Area

Berlin, 27th (Domei News Agency) - People here claimed last night that the Red Army's Christmas Day offensive against the strong defense lines of the Axis forces in various areas had failed, and suffered great losses. There were fierce tank battles in the narrow area between the Volga and Don rivers and the Terek area of the Caucasus. The Soviet army lost 136 tanks in these two areas and other areas of the long front line, including a tank brigade that was completely annihilated in the Terek area. The German Air Force assisted the German and Axis forces in combat on that day, breaking up the Soviet army's attacks. Various German aircraft cooperated to bomb the Soviet army, transport vehicles, and transportation lines. 30 Soviet aircraft were shot down. The temperature on the Eastern Front dropped to minus 20 degrees Celsius. The Soviet commander has dispatched additional troops to attack the Axis forces' positions between the Volga and Don rivers, and used heavy artillery and large tank formations to assist in the battle. However, the Axis forces stood firm and repelled the Soviet army's repeated attacks. The Soviet army's manpower and material resources suffered an electrical shock, with nothing gained. In the Caucasus area, there was a lot of activity on the banks of the Terek River. The Soviet infantry there, with the assistance of large tank formations, attempted to break into the Axis forces' positions, but repeated attacks were defeated. A Soviet tank brigade was annihilated by the German counter-offensive. The weather was bad in the Tuapse area of northwestern Caucasus, with heavy fog. The Soviet army made several local attacks, but was driven back by the German army. The Soviet army on the central front attempted to break through the German defense lines in Rzhev and Velikiye Luki (northwest of Moscow) at night, but was also severely damaged and retreated.

Somewhere on the Soviet border, 26th (Havas Agency) - Yesterday, the Red Army continued to attack the German army in various places on the Eastern Front, but they were all repelled and suffered heavy losses. Here is a summary of the battle situations on each front: (1) On the north bank of the Baksan River in the Caucasus, the Soviet Union is still using large forces to escape the German army's front line, but they are all blocked by the German army and have made no progress, and have lost 29 tanks. (2) The Red Army between the Volga and Don rivers has been repelled several times, losing 42 tanks. The Hungarian army in that area is very active. The Hungarian air force is also coordinating with German aircraft to cover the army's operations. Several Hungarian troops on the east bank of the Don River launched a fierce attack on the Soviet army's positions, and the Soviet army was defeated and retreated. (3) Northwest of Voronezh and in the Kaluga region, the Axis forces launched a large-scale counter-offensive. The Soviet army resisted stubbornly and suffered heavy losses, and was finally forced to retreat. (4) The fierce battle between the German and Soviet armies in the middle reaches of the Don River has lasted for ten days and was still fierce yesterday. (5) The German garrison in Velikiye Luki has repelled the Soviet army's offensive several times and has consolidated the positions around the city.

### Japan's Politics in the Year Since the Start of the Greater East Asia War

The Greater East Asia War has been going on for a year. In this year, Japan has not only established a foundation for certain victory militarily, but has also established a unique political system domestically, in step with military victories. This is a landmark page in Japanese history. It can also be said that there is no precedent in the political history of various countries in the world, because in this year, Japanese politics has rapidly established a strong political leadership of the government in accordance with national goals under the supreme goal of striving for victory. Based on this, it has further formed a new national organization. In this way, the national people and the government's policies have established a strong political situation under close coordination. I remember that during the Second Konoe Cabinet, there were three basic national policies for political reforms in Japan, namely (1) a new political system, (2) the establishment of a national organization, and (3) the achievement of a parliamentary endorsement system. This work was fully realized in just over half a year under the Tojo Cabinet. This is the biggest gain in Japanese politics under the Greater East Asia War. On the one hand, this gain is a necessity of the objective conditions under wartime, and on the other hand, it can be said to be the result of the Tojo Cabinet's decisive execution. The first key to wartime politics is the strengthening of the government's political leadership. The basis of this strengthening should be (1) the integration of political strategy and war, (2) the strengthening of the Prime Minister's authority and the unity of the cabinet, and (3) the comprehensive efficiency of internal and external administration. The promotion of these government affairs was carried out in a straightforward manner when the Tojo Cabinet was formed. That is, Prime Minister Tojo concurrently served as the Minister of the Army as an active-duty general, and first obtained integration with the General Staff Headquarters, and the Prime Minister's position was actually strengthened. Secondly, in order to ensure transportation capacity, the Wartime Transportation Committee was established in the Planning Board on January 6, the Technology Institute was established on February 1, and the Greater East Asia Construction Deliberation Council was established in the Cabinet to allow powerful figures from the private sector to participate in the planning of important national policies. Then, on July 1, local offices were established in 427 locations across the country to strengthen local administration in response to administrative simplification. Regarding the issue of administrative simplification, the outline for implementation was decided by the cabinet meeting on June 16. On the one hand, the number of civil servants in various agencies was reduced, and on the other hand, this was used to allocate resources to the construction of Greater East Asia. The implementation measures were fully announced on November 1 and implemented on the same day. At the same time, the issue of the establishment of the Ministry of Greater East Asia and the outline of the unification of internal and external administration were also fully announced and implemented on November 1, and the government's strong political leadership also permeated the entire administrative system, establishing a new system for administrative operations. Secondly, the consolidation of domestic political forces is essential under wartime. The Japanese government also exerted its strong political leadership in this regard and resolutely implemented the system of recommending candidates for general elections at the end of April. As a result, the elected candidates who were recommended accounted for an absolute majority, which is enough to show the determination of the Japanese people to fully complete the war. At the same time, the Japanese government further focused on the unity of national political forces. A political association was formed by a large number of members of the House of Peers and the House of Representatives and powerful figures from all walks of life, with General Abe Nobuyuki as the president. Soon after, the Imperial Rule Assistance Association was comprehensively reorganized, and the personnel and institutions were expanded. According to the cabinet decision on May 15, the Imperial Rule Assistance Association unified all national movement groups, and established affairs bureau chiefs in local branches to cooperate in strengthening local institutions and guiding activities such as neighborhood associations, becoming an administrative auxiliary institution. By the end of September, the Imperial Rule Assistance Association convened the third Central Cooperation Conference to make the intentions of the superior known to the subordinate, and the subordinate's situation known to the superior. The Imperial Rule Assistance Association became one with the government, achieving the ideal state of an endorsed political system and achieving unprecedented results. It is worth mentioning here that in the past year, all Japanese citizens have been able to cooperate with the government with their sincere attitude. I also recall that Prime Minister Tojo said at a lecture for local governors on November 14 that the government will definitely avoid using power and trusts that the people will do their best to complete the war with their sincere dedication. Therefore, Japan's politics in the past year has exerted the greatest power under the united pace of the whole country, thereby establishing a political system of national unity.

### No Major Changes on the North African Front, Both Sides Focus on Adjusting Positions, British Eighth Army Main Force Approaches Sirte

Bern, Switzerland, December 27th, Havas: It is learned that no major changes have occurred in the situation in North Africa in the past 24 hours. In Tunisia, US troops are still a few miles east of Médenine and El Bab. In Libya, the positions of the British Eighth Army are west of Sirte.

Berlin, December 27th, Allied News: The Tunisian front was relatively quiet yesterday, as the Allied forces are now organizing their defenses after being defeated in the Maktar and El Bab areas last Thursday. The US forces have not attempted to retake the mountains now occupied by German forces. It is also reported that German assault troops have occupied the foothills west of Kairouan. Bern, Switzerland, December 26th, Havas: According to reports from the Axis and Anglo-American sides, there were no major changes on the North African front yesterday. In Tripolitania, activities were limited to scouting. The British also claimed that their advance guard had reached Bir Tarsin and that the main force of the Eighth Army had approached Sirte. At the same time, German Commander-in-Chief Rommel has entrusted the defense of the Misratah line to Italian forces. In Tunisia, Axis forces are consolidating their positions in the Maktar and El Bab areas. There was some fighting six miles northeast of the city. The Anglo-American Allied Headquarters in North Africa announced that a fierce German attack in the Kairouan area was repelled. There was some scouting activity near Bou Arada, west of Teboursouk. Fighting on the Tunisian front has been hampered by bad weather. Berlin also claimed that port facilities and railway transportation in Algeria were heavily bombed by German aircraft. All docks in the port of Algiers were destroyed, and warehouses were also set on fire. At the same time, German fighter groups flew low and bombed trucks carrying food and ammunition to supply Anglo-American Allied forces in Tunisia, causing heavy losses to the enemy.

### US Aircraft Arrive in West Africa

### Extension of the Near East Four-Nation Pact for Five Years as a Guarantee of Peace

Ankara, December 27th, Havas: The Turkish newspaper "Ulus" published an article by parliamentarian Ate, stating that the Saadabad Pact automatically extended for another five years starting from the 25th of this month, because the four signatory countries of Turkey, Iraq, Iran, and Afghanistan did not notify the abolition of the pact. The Foreign Ministers of the four countries sent congratulatory telegrams on the occasion of the extension of the pact. Turkey believes that the pact is a guarantee of peace in the Near East, and that all issues are resolved peacefully. With the international situation becoming increasingly tense, the importance of the pact has also increased. Although Iraq and Iran are not belligerent countries, they are greatly affected by the war. Afghanistan is also in a difficult position. After the extension of the pact, the peace between the four signatory countries will continue to be guaranteed.

### Pétain Appeals for French Unity to Work for the Reconstruction of the Motherland

Vichy, December 27th, Allied News: In his Christmas broadcast on the 26th, President Pétain called on all French people to make further efforts to rebuild France, saying, "I still have unshakable faith in the future of France. I remember that in June 1940, I agreed with you that I would stay in France forever. Today, I still adhere to this belief and work as President to rebuild France. Fellow citizens, in order to overcome current difficulties and restore the traditional face of our France, we must understand that cooperation is essential. The reconstruction of France must also depend on your cooperation. What France will be like next year is difficult to predict at this moment, and it is up to God to decide. But here, I want to say to you that all French people should reflect on the reasons for the current difficulties."

### Ireland Prepares to Resist Aggression

### US Policy Towards North Africa Remains Unchanged, General Giraud Succeeds Darlan in His Former Position, General de Gaulle Expresses Willingness to Cooperate with Him

Lisbon, December 27th, Havas: New York dispatch: General Eisenhower, while on a tour, learned of Darlan's assassination and hurriedly returned to Algiers. According to well-informed sources in the United States, the US policy in North Africa will not change due to Darlan's death. The New York Times also stated that Darlan's death would not affect the temporary agreements made by the United States in North Africa. As for who the US military authorities in North Africa will contact in the future, this can be freely decided by General Eisenhower. The New York Tribune, however, stated that even with Darlan's death, it would be difficult for the Allied forces in North Africa to overcome disagreements.

Tangier, December 27th, Havas: This morning, the Allied Headquarters in Algiers issued a communiqué confirming that General Giraud has succeeded Darlan in managing the administrative affairs of French North Africa.

Tangier, December 27th, Havas: General Giraud stated today after being appointed High Commissioner that his ambition is to be a soldier, not a politician. According to an official spokesman in Algiers, General Giraud has many affairs to attend to, and it is not yet known whether he will actually take over military command in North Africa. However, Giraud's main goal is to continue fighting there. No decision has yet been made on how to organize the High Commissioner's staff. Since General Giraud has accepted the position left by Darlan, it is expected that he will organize a unified French front to resist the Axis forces.

Stockholm, Sweden, December 27th, Havas: According to a report from the London Observer correspondent, General de Gaulle has expressed his willingness to cooperate with General Giraud.

Stockholm, Sweden, December 27th, Havas: London dispatch: General Giraud, when interviewed by American reporters yesterday, refused to comment on the political situation in North Africa caused by Darlan's assassination, but said that it is necessary to strengthen cooperation with General de Gaulle in the future. It is generally believed that this statement can reveal the motives for Darlan's assassination.

Vichy, December 27th, Havas: Political figures here believe that the fact that the assassin of Darlan was quickly executed and that the details of the assassin were not disclosed is to keep the political background of the case as secret as possible. Regarding the selection of Darlan's successor, it is considered very difficult here, because this time the British intelligence personnel dealt a great blow to the United States, and the faith of the French people in North Africa in the United States has been shaken. As for General Giraud, he has no political experience, so it is difficult for him to be competent. The fact that Governor Boisson, General Noguès, and General Juin are holding meetings and have not yet reached a decision proves that their opinions are also inconsistent. The crux of the problem lies in the future attitude of the North African government, because the people of North Africa are practicing Darlan's promises, maintaining General Pétain's policies, and dedicating themselves to the unity between France and its colonies.

### Executive Committee of the Spanish Falange Established Yesterday

Madrid, December 27th, Havas: The Executive Committee of the Spanish Falange was formally established today. Its responsibilities and privileges have been clearly defined.

### Yamamoto Sanetomo, President of the Japanese Renovation Society, Writes to the People of Chongqing

(Tokyo, 17th, Central News Agency) The Japanese journal "Renovation" in its New Year's issue carries an essay by its president, Yamamoto Sanetomo, titled "To the Gentlemen of Chongqing," which essentially states that Roosevelt once said, "America is the arsenal of democracy" to rally against the Axis powers. However, America has also been made dictatorial by Roosevelt's own hand, and opposition to Roosevelt's political methods is increasing daily. The previous defeat of Roosevelt's father in the New York gubernatorial election is clear evidence of this. Furthermore, the recent request for wartime special powers was also unresolved in the House of Representatives, proving that Roosevelt's authority has been swept away. Hoover recently criticized the impropriety of domestic divisions and fully exposed the struggles between American industry and bureaucrats. The author Pearl Buck recently also criticized the government based on issues of black racial equality and black blood transfusions. According to statistics, there are currently 12.8 million black people living in the United States, but the actual number is closer to 16 million. Although the American government ostensibly allows them to participate in political conferences, in reality, Mitchell, who was elected as a senator with hundreds of thousands of votes, was prevented from riding in first-class carriages solely because he was black. It is unknown what America's so-called "democracy," "human equality," and "humanitarian justice" really are. I have personally witnessed the tragic oppression of black people. America also fears an increase in the number of black people in America, so they offer free abortions, can this be called humanitarianism? Furthermore, Chinese immigrants in America receive the same treatment as black people. This is something that Chiang Kai-shek and Soong Tzu-wen are not unaware of, so why are they willing to place Asia, with its long and glorious history, in the position of a slave to the Anglo-Saxons? Chiang and others are foolishly complacent because of the glory of their ancestors, yet they are willing to obliterate the glory of Chinese history and culture, and the teachings of Confucius and other sages. The representative black magazine "Africa" once stated that Anglo-American imperialism is nothing more than white supremacy over the world, and hopes that China will also recognize this point and not suffer the same fate as Africans. Furthermore, it is hoped that Chinese people will recognize that Japan's motive stems from the survival of the entire East. China and Japan are of the same culture and race, and have an inseparable relationship. However, if China is controlled by Anglo-American imperialism, the consequences will be unimaginable. It is ridiculous that Chiang Kai-shek views the imperialism of the white race as sacred, while looking down on Japan's true intention to revive Asia. Gentlemen in the rear, why do you tolerate the advance of Anglo-American forces into Asia and Africa, but not allow Japan to revive Asia? What is the reason for this? What country other than Japan possesses the military and economic power to achieve human equality? It is hoped that the gentlemen of Chongqing will recognize this point and consider the future of the nation. If the independence of China that Chongqing desires must be borrowed from England and America, then the future result will inevitably be that China's state of semi-colonialism will become even more profound, and may even become slaves to England and America. This can be clearly understood from the aforementioned situation of black people and the current situation of France. Moreover, Japan's military and political power has already controlled the entire Greater East Asia, so dependence on England and America is impossible. Sun Yat-sen, the father of the Chinese nation, once said that if China and Japan do not cooperate closely, there is no way to realize the liberation of East Asia. The predictions of the East Asian future by Chinese and Japanese visionaries have been realized in the first year of the Greater East Asia War, expelling the British and Americans from East Asia. The results of the lifelong revolutionary efforts of Sun Yat-sen and Song Jiaoren are only being held by a few people in Chongqing. What is being given to the 450 million people is only starvation. The leaders of Chongqing have turned the great cause of the revolution into a tool to satisfy their own desires, and they are not only traitors who are selling out the 450 million people to England and America, but also public enemies of East Asia. The spirits of Sun Yat-sen and the other martyrs in heaven will surely be unable to rest in peace knowing of Chongqing's actions to destroy the nation and the people. The chairman and his comrades, in the face of countless difficulties, disregard slanderous attacks and are not afraid of the destruction by evil forces. They take all the people of the nation as their focus and the future of Asia in decades and centuries as their goal. Their painstaking efforts for the country and the people and their unyielding spirit are truly felt by both gods and men. Millions of Japanese soldiers and the entire nation are prepared to die, starting this war in the East with the sole purpose of planning for the future of East Asia. The fundamental ideal of the Japanese people today is the same ideal of shared security and common destiny that the Chinese people possess. One hundred million Japanese people are willing to make any sacrifice to liberate East Asia and strive for the glory of victory. It is hoped that the gentlemen of Chongqing will understand that Japan's glory is also China's glory. Only after China has gained liberation can the independence and prosperity of Asia and the independence and prosperity of China and Japan be realized.

### The Authorities Adjust Food Supply for the People; Rationed Food Supply is Sufficient; Rice Stores Collect Payment Today for Purchase Orders; Rationed Amount Increased and Price Appropriately Reduced

In order to alleviate the people's hardship and maintain the food supply within the concessions, the authorities of the Public and French Concessions have implemented a rationed food supply system based on population since July 6th of this year, eliminating the situation of queuing to buy rice. Residents within the concessions can purchase rice and flour from designated rice stores with which the authorities have contracted, based on the rice purchase certificates issued by the authorities. Since its implementation, it has been quite effective. Shanghai News reporters learned yesterday from relevant parties and the rice industry that the authorities are determined to maintain the food supply for the people of Shanghai. In addition to making every effort to facilitate the source of supply, the rationed amount of rice and flour will be increased to make it more sufficient for taxpayers within the concessions and prevent private traders from raising prices for profit. The 22nd term household food rations are approved from January 1st to 9th of next year. All designated rice stores are closed on the 10th as usual. Each designated rice store received a purchase order from the Rice and Grain Office: (1) Rice is 304 yuan and 40 cents per bag, the previous term was 309 yuan and 30 cents; (2) Flour is 92 yuan per bag, the previous term was 95 yuan. The amount of rice flour paired with white rice is the same as the previous term, but the amount of flour has increased by about one-quarter. Therefore, it is expected that the next term will still be one and a half liters of white rice, and the flour will increase to two catties, and the exact amount and selling price will be clearly announced by the authorities. Each rice store is approved to pay the fee and receive the delivery order today, and pick up the goods from the designated Swire Zhexing warehouse in the next few days, and sell them in accordance with the date and method stipulated by the authorities.

### The Municipal Party Headquarters Establishes Social Service Centers in the Special District Two

In order to seek the welfare of the people and carry out various social undertakings, the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Headquarters has specially established four social service centers in the Second Special District of Nanshi Hongkou, and has previously appointed commissioners to be responsible for the preparation. They have been established one after another. Now, Mr. Luo Chushan, the director of the Second Special District Social Service Center, has been ordered to prepare and has been officially established and started working. The address is No. 12, Lane 3, Yihe Li, Beile Road, French Concession. In order to promote people's health and popularize common sense among the people, free medical treatment and medicine distribution, a people's inquiry office, and a people's writing service office have been established first, and a people's remedial school is being planned to promote social education.

### Special District Stamps; Not Allowed for Use in Nanshi

Regarding the use of stamp tax tickets by merchants and residents in the Nanshi District, the Nanshi Collection Office of the Shangbao District has long announced that they should be purchased and affixed from the office or designated sales points. In order to prevent tax evasion, the office found that a small number of merchants and residents in the Nanshi District occasionally used special district stamp tax tickets and stamp tax tickets that had been invalidated long ago. In order to prevent tax evasion, the office announced that all vouchers with special district stamps affixed by Nanshi merchants and residents must be submitted to the office within ten days from today for inspection to verify authenticity and rectify the situation.

### Hotel Investigation; Reasons for Travelers' Stay

Suspicious Persons Will Be Reported to the Police Station

The citizen identity cards of the two concessions have been completely issued. Since the 16th of this month, all hotels in the concessions have been handling the procedures for verifying the identities of all travelers. All those who stayed before the 16th and still stay in the hotel after the 16th are also subject to investigation, including their nationality, name, origin, and reasons for staying. At present, all hotels and inns have refused to allow those without citizen identity cards to stay. If suspicious persons are encountered, reports have also been made to the police station.

### Municipal Grain Bureau; Planning to Allocate Rice for Next Month

Deadline for Reporting Changes in Household Registration

In order to make the household-based grain distribution in each district more precise, the Municipal Grain Administration believes that the changes in household registration in each district are closely related to the implementation of grain administration. Therefore, it specially notified all affiliated companies and public rice shops to start working on the number of food rice to be allocated for January of next year. Any increases, decreases, or changes in household registration in each district must be submitted to the Grain Bureau before the end of this year, so as to use this household registration roster as the basis for overall allocation.

### Concert by the Music Association

The Shanghai Music Association's 10th public performance of the first season was held yesterday (the 27th) at 5:30 pm at the Lyceum Theater on Poussin Road. The association's president Tei Takashi, and the person in charge, Hara Zenichiro, were present. The association's advisors Itabashi Ryuji, Commander Ota, Commander Kakeda, Kawasaki Torao, and Lieutenant Commander Yokoyama, directors Iwasaki Aiji, Osaka Yoichi, Kawakita Nagamasa, and Fukuda Chiyosaku were also present. Miss Shigemitsu Hikari's solo piano performance was ethereal, pleasing, and moving. The other programs were also exceptionally brilliant.

### Record of the East Asia Economic Conference - Translated from the Late November Issue of "Domei Jyunpo"

Day 1

(November 26th) The East Asia Economic Conference, with the participation of more than 500 members from Japan, Manchuria, China, and Mongolia, as well as influential economists from other private sectors, and relevant government officials, held its fourth conference at the Greater East Asia Hall in Marunouchi, Tokyo, over three days starting on the 26th. On the first day of the conference, the 26th, starting at 8:00 am, the new president, Ogura Masatsune, gave the opening speech, followed by reports on the association's affairs by Japanese headquarters director Fujiyama Aiichiro, Manchurian headquarters director Feng Hanqing, Central China headquarters director Chen Shao-wei, North China headquarters director Izumi Son, and Xinjiang headquarters director Munakata Hisayuki. Next, the election of 80 new members to the council was held. At 9:30 am, the opening ceremony was held, with Prime Minister Tojo giving a congratulatory speech. In the afternoon session, speeches were given by Aoki, Minister of Greater East Asia, on "The Economic Construction of Greater East Asia," and Kaya Okinori, Minister of Finance, on "The Ideals of Economic Construction in Greater East Asia." Following this, Ruan Zhenduo, Minister of Economy of Manchuria, and Wang Yintai, Superintendent of the Industry Bureau of the North China Political Affairs Commission, gave detailed reports on the economic construction of each region. The first day's conference ended at 5:00 pm.

Speech by Aoki, Minister of Greater East Asia

(Omitted) Regarding the measures for economic construction in Greater East Asia, the Greater East Asia Construction Deliberation Council, which is affiliated to the Cabinet, has already conducted a thorough review and replied to the government. The government is very pleased with this reply and is implementing various measures based on it. The contents are briefly described as follows:

First, the economic construction of Greater East Asia is based on morality, aiming to build a new economic order in Greater East Asia and contribute to the construction of a new world economy. This is based on the traditional Japanese spirit of "Hakko Ichiu," and has essential differences from the colonial policies of countries such as the United States, England, and the Netherlands in the East. Therefore, the residents of each country in Greater East Asia must be made to do their best and get what they deserve. To achieve this, they must cooperate with each other and move forward towards a common ideal. Second, it is necessary to comprehensively enhance the economic strength of the entire Greater East Asia by leveraging the human resources and resources of each region, and to complete the self-sufficient national defense economy necessary for the defense of Greater East Asia, with the Empire as its center. This will be the only way to build a superior position within the scope of the Greater East Asia world economy, and at the same time ensure the survival of each country in the Greater East Asia region, so that the people of each country can live and work in peace. Third, the focus of current construction work must be placed on the rapid enhancement of the power to wage war. If the Greater East Asia War is not won, all ideals and hopes will be reduced to nothing. We must know that the countries of Greater East Asia and their residents share a common destiny, and the concept of opposition like "brothers quarreling within the walls" is absolutely not allowed. We must work together to enhance comprehensive combat power.

Under the above-mentioned ideals, our Imperial Country is exerting the full strength of the nation to complete the Greater East Asia War and is working towards the construction of Greater East Asia. The reason why the government established the Ministry of Greater East Asia is to enable the central government and the local areas to quickly and appropriately handle the various matters of Greater East Asia construction under a unified organization.

Next, I would like to briefly explain the specific measures for economic construction:

First, measures related to agriculture, forestry, and aquatic and livestock industries. The majority of the population in each region of Greater East Asia is engaged in agriculture, forestry, and aquatic and livestock industries, so this point needs special attention. Important food grains necessary for the Imperial Country can be ensured to be self-sufficient through Japan-Manchuria cooperation. Areas with insufficient food grains can be supplied by other regions. At the current time of war, there are various inconveniences in transportation, and it is not yet possible to expect complete satisfaction, but this is only a temporary phenomenon, and the problem will be solved with the establishment of fundamental countermeasures in the future.

Regarding forestry measures, the current focus must be placed on the supply and securing of materials necessary for military demand and the expansion of production capacity. Therefore, the development of southern forest resources is particularly expected.

In terms of the aquatic industry, in accordance with the characteristics of each region, the aim is to supply and secure aquatic products, and to prepare refrigeration, freezing, processing, and other facilities, and to promote the comprehensive development of the aquatic industry. In terms of the livestock industry, along with the supply and securing of livestock food grains, the expansion of the production of wool, fur, and leather is also an urgent task.

Regarding fiber resources, in accordance with the characteristics of each region, the aim is to comprehensively develop and utilize various resources such as cotton, hemp, silk, wool, and weaving raw materials. In particular, the increase in cotton production in China is highly anticipated, and it is hoped that all relevant parties will pay special attention to it.

In addition, southern specialties such as sand, rubber, quinine, and mallet trees have more than enough to supply the needs of the co-prosperity sphere, and these must be scientifically utilized so as to ensure the superior position of Greater East Asia in the world economy.

Next, measures related to the steel industry. The focus must be placed on enhancing the power to wage war, ensuring wartime life, and establishing the foundation for future industrial development. Furthermore, the aim is to achieve the leaping development of Greater East Asia's industry and the prosperity of the people of Greater East Asia. In the current situation, the focus must be placed on the construction of steel, coal, oil, other liquid fuels, copper, aluminum, aircraft, ships, fertilizers, and electricity. Therefore, in order to implement this purpose, the labor force, transportation capacity, materials, and funds within the co-prosperity sphere must be concentrated as much as possible and utilized. In addition, regarding national defense industries and basic industries, etc., in order to strengthen their organic integration throughout the Greater East Asia region in industrial sectors that are indispensable for enhancing combat power, the Imperial Country must統轄their construction and operation. Regarding civilian industries and other industries, on the one hand, autonomy in management should be sought, and on the other hand, technicians and laborers necessary for local development must be sought from the local residents as much as possible.

After investigating the existing state of resources, the local plans for major industries are roughly as follows:

(A) The focus of new expansion in the steel industry will be placed in Manchuria and North China.

(B) The coal mining industry will be extensively developed in North China, Manchuria, and the rest of the region. For special coals such as raw material coal and "producer gas coal," a focus on increased production will be implemented throughout the region.

(C) The development of natural petroleum will focus on South China, and artificial petroleum projects will be expanded with a focus on Manchuria, Sakhalin, Hokkaido, and North China.

(D) The aluminum industry will currently focus on Korea and Manchuria, and may be expanded to North China and the South in the future.

(E) The fiber industry will be temporarily limited to a certain scope, and will then be gradually expanded to the co-prosperity sphere region in accordance with changes in various circumstances.

(F) The Imperial Country places special emphasis on the development of high-level industries such as precision industries, machinery industries, and weapons industries.

(G) The development of electric power, in response to national defense plans and industrial development plans, will be implemented comprehensively and systematically, with a focus on hydroelectric power generation.

Again, measures related to transportation. It is no exaggeration to say that the current bottleneck in Greater East Asia's economic construction is transportation. In order to quickly transport the abundant resources of various places, the functions and characteristics of ships, railways, automobiles, aviation, etc. must be fully utilized, and the overall efficiency of transportation must be maximized. At the same time, in the Sea of Japan, the East China Sea, the South China Sea, and other areas, a powerful transportation zone centered on Japan must be created, making it like an inland sea within Greater East Asia. In the continental sphere of Manchuria, China, and Mongolia, and in other marine spheres in the South, it is necessary to establish the transportation situation necessary for industry in accordance with their respective positions, and to further make this a base for the development of transportation to the world.

In short, in order to complete the current Greater East Asia War and carry out powerful economic construction, it is strongly felt that it is necessary to comprehensively and systematically implement measures in the above-mentioned economic sectors.

Currently, the construction of Greater East Asia is progressing with great strides. In addition to our ever-growing Imperial Country, the State of Manchuria, which is united with the Imperial Country with one heart and one mind, is also welcoming its tenth anniversary of its founding, and industry and the various fields of economy have made great strides. In addition, the Republic of China has been in Nanjing for more than two years, and the war has not yet ended due to the stubborn Chongqing regime's continued resistance, but its political influence is great, so economic reconstruction and construction are being carried out step by step. Under the spirit of sharing weal and woe with Japan, it is making a great contribution to the construction of Greater East Asia.

Furthermore, our country's cooperation with Siam and Annam, especially in the economic field, is becoming increasingly close. In the vast new occupied territories in the South, we have further secured the treasure trove that is said to be the only one in the world, and are actively engaged in development and construction activities in accordance with the different characteristics of each region. In other words, the economic construction of Greater East Asia has already embarked on a magnificent start. However, the Greater East Asia War is still raging, and the construction of Greater East Asia is still very difficult. In order to win this long-term war and complete the great cause of construction, on the one hand, it depends on the hard work and efforts of the 100 million people of the Imperial Country, and on the other hand, the cooperation of the countries and residents of the co-prosperity sphere is also indispensable.

In the end, the solution to the current problems depends on cooperation. This so-called cooperation refers to: correctly understanding the positions of the other parties based on the sense of shared destiny of the countries and residents of Greater East Asia, and jointly seeking agreement on national policy views.

However, in order to smoothly realize this cooperative relationship, it is not enough to rely solely on the agreement of opinions between countries. It is also necessary to seek genuine friendship and integration through the contact of people's business and their daily lives. What I have said above is not only a theory, but also a conclusion and a belief that I have recently gained during my foreign service. As for the fate of the newly established Ministry of Greater East Asia, I always want to do my best to seek mutual cooperation between the countries and residents of Greater East Asia. In this sense, the East Asia Economic Conference makes a great contribution to the communication of opinions and the realization of cooperation between Japan, Manchuria, and China. I hope that in the midst of the current tension of the great war, this conference will move the task further forward and make further contributions to the construction of Greater East Asia, in order to thoroughly complete the purpose of the conference.

Speech by Finance Minister Kaya

(Omitted) Among the various measures, especially regarding trade, finance, and fiscal issues, I would like to briefly describe the following:

The glorious achievements of the Imperial Army have instantly increased the resources of the co-prosperity sphere, but the effective and appropriate utilization depends on how the planned transactions within and outside the sphere are conducted.

The exchange of goods in Greater East Asia aims to complete the Greater East Asia War and enhance national power, that is, to establish and develop the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere, and to implement highly planned transactions centered on Japan. Therefore, on the one hand, in response to the already decided industrial location plans in various places in Greater East Asia, a comprehensive transaction plan is set up, and at the same time, speed and accuracy are the first priority, and it is also necessary to comprehensively adjust this plan in connection with various measures such as exchange rates, prices, tariffs, and transaction institutions.

As for finance, in a nutshell, it is the issue of establishing the Greater East Asia financial zone centered on the Japanese yen. Settlements between regions within the Greater East Asia zone must be executed in accordance with the Japanese yen, with the Bank of Japan at the center, in a comprehensive and unified manner. At the same time, the currencies of each region in the zone must use the Japanese yen as the value standard and issuing base, and the issuing institutions of each region in the zone must have a yen transaction account in the Bank of Japan. It goes without saying that settlements between regions must be executed in this way, and settlements with regions outside the zone must also be executed in this way. Therefore, the exchange rate of the currencies of each region in the zone against the Japanese yen must be fairly assessed, so that the comprehensive planning of materials, labor, and other aspects of Greater East Asia can be effectively completed. At the same time, the prices and currency values of each region must be stabilized, so that the overall production, material exchange, and labor dispatch of Greater East Asia can be promoted smoothly, and the national defense economic power can be increased.

Next, regarding fiscal matters, it is hoped that each region in the zone will be able to bear its own military facility expenses, industrial development expenses, etc., in order to strengthen fiscal independence. At the same time, efforts must be made to mutually adjust the fiscal burden. The so-called mutual adjustment of the fiscal burden is nothing more than the fiscal "concept of each doing what they can and cooperating and bearing the burden." That is, each region within the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere must be aware of the lofty, universal, and common purpose of "establishing, maintaining, and developing Greater East Asia," and must actively contribute its own share to achieve this purpose. At the same time, from a negative perspective, there must be a determination to make great sacrifices for a long time in order to achieve the above-mentioned purpose. Each region must develop its own characteristics and do its best to cooperate and bear everything. In short, this is a great awakening that is characterized by the entire Greater East Asia sharing weal and woe. Based on the above-mentioned ideals, the emphasis in the expenditures of each region must be placed on many measures to establish and develop comprehensive national defense and economic power, in order to stabilize and improve the people's livelihood. In terms of revenue, each region must adopt a simple system based on fair standards as much as possible, and in particular, consider the choice of tax types according to the circumstances and the level of intelligence in each region. A formalistic uniformity must not be imposed on each region. Regarding the issuance of public bonds in each region, in conjunction with financial旋　, it must be implemented and controlled based on comprehensive planning. In accordance with the different circumstances in each city, appropriate methods must be used to ensure the source of funds needed for its finances.

The above has given a rough description of some measures for economic construction in Greater East Asia. Of course, such a great undertaking cannot be accomplished in a day or two. During implementation, it may be divided into several time stages. At the same time, each region has its own characteristics, and it is not possible to impose the same measures and rules on all of them. However, the most important point is that, in the end, it must be organically and comprehensively unified with Japan as the core.

### Implementing New Price Control Measures: Establishing a Price Control Bureau, Adjusting Rationing with a Common Pricing System, and Implementing Normal Consumption Methods for Rice and Other Goods

In order to deliberate on price issues, relevant authorities have established local price control committees in various regions. Furthermore, to unify the official management affairs between the central government and local areas, a Price Control Bureau has been established in Shanghai. Similar committees have also been set up in Nanjing, Bengbu, Hangzhou, Hankou, Guangzhou, Subei, and Suhuai. The Price Control Committee differs from the Price Control Bureau in that the former is an agency for price deliberation, while the latter is an organization for price management. The former determines policies, while the latter implements them.

Price Control: Four Major Principles

The Shanghai Regional Price Control Bureau, following the guidelines of the local price control committees, is determined to implement the following four new principles: (1) Using materials crucial to the economic center as a foundation, referencing prices before the exchange of new and old currencies in May of this year to determine an appropriate price. (2) Reducing coal prices to achieve moderate rice prices. (3) To expand production, making efforts to acquire raw materials from North China, Mengjiang, Manchuria, and the South to prevent the accumulation of materials in specific regions. Utilizing idle capital for production, the Price Control Committee will be at the center, with various agencies assisting in the process.

Reducing Coal Prices, Adjusting Rice Prices

The above four principles are the backbone for implementing price controls. More detailed content can be divided into seven items: (1) Aiming for gradual stability, price control is based on prices before the exchange of new and old currencies in May of this year. (2) The Price Control Committee is at the center of price control, receiving guidance from relevant agencies, and comprehensively studying plans. (3) Appropriate prices will initially target materials crucial to the economic center. After agreement by private organizations, they will be implemented with the approval of administrative authorities. Coal prices will be reduced (already implemented), and rice prices will be adjusted so that other prices can be reduced accordingly. Matters concerning electricity, transportation, wages, land rent, housing rent, loan interest, and profits will also be moderated.

Easing Regional Controls

(4) Promoting increased production of materials in the interior and collecting raw materials from various regions to adjust material needs. At the same time, the agencies for handling goods distribution will be adjusted, adopting a common pricing system, prohibiting market manipulation and speculative trading, and implementing normal consumption methods for rice and other necessities. (5) Regarding restrictions on the movement of important materials, it is strictly forbidden to move them out of the area. Movement within the jurisdiction will be relaxed under the control of the authorities, minimizing accumulation in any one area and streamlining transportation to ensure smooth material exchange. (6) To smooth the currency policy based on the new legal tender and expand its circulation, idle capital will be absorbed and used for production. (7) Concerning price control, private groups will automatically enforce it.

### Establishment of the New National Movement Promotion Association in This City

Mayor Chen Attends and Gives Instructions

To promote the New National Movement, cultivate the spirit of the New National, thereby enriching national strength, and shoulder the important task of building Greater East Asia, the city government has organized the Shanghai Special City New National Movement Promotion Association according to the organizational regulations of the central New National Movement Promotion Committee branch. Preparations have been completed, and the inaugural meeting was held yesterday (the 27th) at 3 PM at No. 15 Sifei Road. The ceremony was simple and grand. Attendees included Chairman Mayor Chen Gongbo, Committee Members Zhao Zunyue, Lu Ying, Ling Xianwen, Ye Xuesong, Lin Jiongan, Pan Da, Chen Fumu, Sun Mingqi, Gu Weiwu, Hu Dunfu, Mo Guokang, Lu Qi, Xi Peiwen, Wang Jingxin, Qu Zhonglun, and Director Feng from the Official Propaganda Department's Shanghai office. After the establishment meeting at 3 PM, the first committee meeting was held, during which Chairman Chen gave instructions, full of encouragement. Director Feng then reported on the significance and process of establishing the New National Movement Association, with profound implications. Secretary-General Xi then reported on the preparations for the association, followed by discussions on proposals, passing the association's meeting rules, and formulating implementation measures for the city's National Group Worship, referring to the national group worship guidelines promulgated by the central government. After the meeting, a discussion session was held, and the entire group took a photo before adjourning.

### Authorities Seek to Lower Firewood Prices

Regarding firewood prices, it is heard that the two authorities have paid close attention and decided to find ways to lower them, or to assess and set price limits, ordering merchants in the industry to comply. In addition to lowering prices, the authorities will assist in purchasing large quantities of firewood to be shipped to Shanghai for sale, thereby increasing the supply of goods. Therefore, firewood prices may tend to fall.

### Prostitutes Disappear from Nanjing Road and Enter the "Morality Zone"

To rectify the city's appearance, the Public Concession Police authorities have absolutely prohibited prostitutes from forcibly soliciting customers in the Nanjing Road area. They have also issued prostitute licenses and designated the area north of Edward Road, east of Yuqiaqing Road, south of Fuzhou Road, and west of Shandong Road as the "Morality Zone," ordering prostitutes to move into the "Morality Zone" to operate. Since the issuance of this order, the prostitution business in the Nanjing Road area has disappeared, and they have all moved into the "Morality Zone" to continue their business. They have also been ordered to have the Prostitute Guild notify all prostitutes to obtain licenses in accordance with the regulations, and no evasion is allowed. Any further violations will be severely punished if discovered.

### Sugar and Oil Prepared for Per Capita Rationing, Special Rationing for Various Industries, Limited to Legitimate Business Use, Adopting an Application, Registration, and Approval System

To eliminate resale for profit and allow legitimate food users to obtain fair allocation, the Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office and the Edible Oil Industry Wholesale Office, with the approval of the military rationing authorities, are preparing to implement per capita rationing. Once detailed consideration and all preparation procedures for per capita allocation are completed, specific measures will be announced and implemented. According to sources at the Shanghai Social Reporter at the Sugar Merchants Cooperative and the Edible Oil Wholesale Office, industries that have legitimate business needs for sugar and oil after the implementation of per capita rationing will receive special allocations. (1) Confectionery and biscuit factories, cafes, etc., will receive the necessary sugar. (2) You tiao, deep-frying, roasted goods industries, Chinese and Western restaurants, etc., will receive the necessary edible oil. This is to ensure that their businesses are not affected by per capita rationing. The specific measures for special allocation are still under discussion, but will adopt an application, registration, and approval system, limited to applicants with proven legitimate needs. The amount of allocation will be determined by the needs of the business. Strict regulations will require that the sugar and oil obtained must be completely used for business needs and must not be stored or transferred to others for use or sold secretly at inflated prices. Violators will have their allocation permanently terminated.

### Registration of Cloth Shipments

Public Notice No. 627 issued by the Public Works Department states that all manufacturers of cotton yarn and cotton cloth produced between the 11th and 31st of this month should register with the Bureau at No. 209 Jiangxi Road, Office No. 624, before January 5th. Cotton cloth produced between January 1st and 15th should be registered before January 20th. Subsequently, all manufacturers should report shipments twice a month. For more details, please refer to the above notice.

### Training Ceremony Held Yesterday for the Self-Defense Youth Corps of the Baojia System: Strengthening the Body to Serve the Community

The Public Concession Baojia Self-Defense Corps Youth Department has achieved excellent results since it began physical training this month. Yesterday (the 27th) at 10 AM, a grand ceremony was held at the Racecourse Plaza to mark the start of training. A total of 25 cadres and 355 members from seven districts, including Central, Laoza, Chengdu, Xinzha, Jing'an, Gordon, and Putuo, attended. Chinese and Japanese officials participating in the ceremony included Deputy Chairman Yuan Liden of the Public Works Department, Permanent Director Cheng Zhiliang, Deputy Police Commissioner General Goshima, Deputy Chairman Wang Boyuan of the Baojia Guidance Committee, Director Shigeta of the Baojia Guidance Department, senior staff, chiefs of various police stations, and all Lianbao chiefs within the concession. Japanese military and constitutional authorities and youth groups sent official representatives. The ceremony began at 10 AM, with the Public Works Department band playing music and raising the corps flag. After everyone sang the Youth Department corps song, a moment of silence was observed for the spirits of East Asia. Peng Sijian, chairman of the Youth Department, reported that basic training began last week after the internal establishment last month. Today, everyone is in high spirits and has achieved considerable results. The purpose of the training is (1) to strengthen oneself and (2) to serve the community. He hoped that everyone would continue to work hard to complete the great mission of the Youth Department in the Baojia system. The Chinese and Japanese official representatives, led by Deputy Commissioner General Goshima and Deputy Chairman Wang Boyuan, inspected the members. The members then performed basic training exercises, including standing at attention, resting, turning left and right, turning backward on the spot, and marching. Deputy Chairman Wang Boyuan then gave instructions, saying that efforts should be made to fulfill one's duties and be law-abiding. This training is to strengthen the body and maintain social order, so as to achieve the goal of benefiting oneself and others. He hoped that the short-term training would be completed and that the entire self-defense corps would be trained, expecting the self-defense corps to follow everyone's lead in the future to complete the mission. Thus, today's members are the pioneers of Baojia self-defense. Deputy Commissioner General Goshima then gave instructions, stating that everyone bears the important mission of building a new Shanghai and creating a new history for centuries to come. In the past, due to the evil forces of Britain and the United States, the spirit of youth could not be promoted. The establishment of the Baojia organization this spring, thanks to everyone's efforts, has allowed the people within the concession to live in peace. The Youth Department was created by organizing the Baojia system, and he hoped that everyone would work hard to train, maintain治安, and remove obstacles to complete the Youth Department's mission. The Youth Department's members from various districts then held ball games in rotation for entertainment, and the meeting adjourned at noon.

### Planning Sailboat Operations to Improve Marine Transport

To improve freight transport along the Chinese coast for trade purposes, the authorities plan to operate large sailboats to various ports along the Chinese coast and in the south, so as to facilitate the transportation of materials. Sailboat transport in North and Central China has already begun, and the opening of routes to the south will soon be realized. Therefore, trade along the Chinese coast will gradually recover, and the exchange of goods will not be affected by vessel problems.

### Young Readers Save Money on Candy to Support Poverty Relief

A letter from young readers, the Ying brothers, states: "The weather is very cold, and the water outside is freezing into ice. Our father (Mr. Ying Yongyu) said: The Shenbao is launching the 100,000 Gold Poverty Relief Movement in the spirit of serving society. Now, the two of us brothers have saved ten yuan from buying candy and toys and are sending it to your newspaper as a donation to support poverty relief. We hope that all the children in the city will save money from buying toys and candy and donate it to newspapers. We also hope that your newspaper will help poor, homeless children so that they don't freeze or starve. From Ying Chun Gao and Ying Chun Tong."

Also, Du Xinwu wrote in a letter that south of the Xuhui Sacred Heart Convent there is a five- or six-year-old boy who is bald, barefoot, and poorly clothed and has been crying from hunger and cold for three days. Presumably, his parents have abandoned him because they cannot afford to raise him. He hopes that the priests there will quickly send him to an orphanage to save his life. Also, Mr. Xinyi generously donated one hundred yuan, bringing the balance to five thousand three hundred thirty-seven yuan.

### Colder Weather in This City, Increasing Number of Frozen Corpses on the Streets

Datong News Agency reports: This city has again been controlled by a cold wave since yesterday. The temperature has dropped sharply to below zero degrees Celsius. The north wind is biting, and the ditches are freezing very thickly. The number of corpses frozen to death on the streets has increased. Therefore, winter relief has become extremely important. The porridge distribution station on Wuding Road is being actively planned and opened by Fang Tongshan and Chen Junhong. At the same time, a shelter is also being planned on Yuyuan Road to benefit the poor.

The climate in this city was mild for the past few days, resembling early spring. Since the winter solstice, it has suddenly turned bitterly cold. Last night, the north wind was biting, piercing the skin, and the deep winter weather has arrived, causing many poor and homeless people and beggars to be unable to withstand the hunger and cold and to freeze to death. Within the French Concession, thirty corpses of men, women, and children were found yesterday morning. The police notified the charity to collect and bury them.

### Speaking Up for the Baojia Authorities

— (Lupu Wosheng)

Since the implementation of the Baojia system and the establishment of self-defense corps posts in the two concessions and the Southwestern Municipal area of Shanghai, terror has decreased, petty criminals have disappeared, and local security has become increasingly peaceful. Not only can ordinary citizens live and work in peace, but social order is also well-organized. This is all due to the proper guidance of the various Baojia authorities and the ability of each self-defense corps member to understand the meaning of the Baojia system and its relationship to themselves, so that they can happily work hard in their positions. However, this city has a vast area, a large population, and complex affairs. Regarding all matters of Baojia reform, they will inevitably arise one after another. The Baojia authorities, with their many officials, will be able to coordinate, take a broad view, and see the subtle details, so they will have plenty of room to maneuver. Therefore, I need not be redundant. However, as a member of the self-defense corps, I also bear a part of the responsibility for serving society and maintaining local security. I dare not remain silent about my ignorant opinions. Therefore, I humbly offer my humble opinions on Baojia reform matters, listed below as a small contribution.

(A) Regarding the Baojia Committee: (1) Preparing and Implementing Matters. The organization of the Baojia system in this city is grand, and what should be established and what should be reformed depends on the economy for its driving force. It seems appropriate to organize a unified financial institution (i.e., the Baojia Bank) to facilitate this. At the same time, it should also encourage savings among all levels of staff and self-defense corps members to cultivate a frugal lifestyle. (2) Establish a Baojia Hospital to benefit all levels of staff and self-defense corps members and their families, so that they can enjoy the right to free medical treatment when they encounter illness. (3) Establish a Baojia Free School to cultivate talent. Since this city has been affected by the war, prices are extremely high, and ordinary families already feel difficulty in daily life, let alone the education of their children. It must be known that education is a major undertaking for a hundred years, and cultivating talent is also a top priority. However, for the sake of the generally poor Baojia staff and self-defense corps members who are unable to afford their children's education, it seems necessary to establish a Baojia Free School. (4) Publish a Baojia Daily to facilitate publicity. At the same time, it will be even more conducive to integrating general public opinion in society. Other Baojia laws and regulations and various news can also be widely disseminated, so as not to create isolation. A copy must be posted daily on notice boards in each Baojia street and near the sentry boxes in suitable locations, so that women and children will know, which will be even more effective. (5) Organize job introductions and establish unemployment registration, introducing people based on their talents and selecting the best for employment, so that unemployed members can resolve this kind of pain and feel secure in their positions, so that the efficiency of the Baojia will be greatly increased.

(B) Belonging to the Liaison Office of each District: (1) Add winter coats and raincoats. Among the self-defense corps members, many are in the poor class, and their winter clothing is often insufficient. Whenever it is late at night and it is windy and rainy, those with weak physical strength find it difficult to persevere. Therefore, considering the circumstances, it seems imperative to establish winter coats and raincoats. (2) Add night-time flashlights to facilitate work. (3) Establish opinion boxes to communicate public opinion. (4) The name and address of the person responsible for the alarm key should be marked in a conspicuous place on the alarm, and the same mark should be made at the location of the custodian. (5) The Baojia head's office (shop or residence) should be marked with a wooden sign in a conspicuous place at the door for identification. However, it should not be written on paper to prevent it from easily falling off. (6) Increase secret inspections and attendance checks. If a member is found to have violated the rules, a warning should be given first, then a demerit is recorded for repeated violations, and punishment is given for repeated offenses. Conversely, if a member is found to be energetic and works conscientiously during the service period, they should first be given spiritual encouragement, then a merit is recorded, and a reward is given for accumulated merits to encourage the members' spirit. (7) Practice courtesy, such as when a passer-by asks for directions, give them a warm attitude; (8) Formulate detailed service rules for members and print them in the inspection book and mark them in the sentry box for compliance; (9) The garbage in the sentry box must be cleaned daily, and at the same time, it is forbidden to throw melon skins, fruit shells, phlegm, and the like at will to ensure cleanliness and hygiene. (10) If the armbands and waistbands of each member are worn or damaged, they must be replaced at any time to maintain appearance. (11) If there is a conflict in the guard duty time due to the duties of each member, they should be allowed to adjust the shifts appropriately to avoid affecting their duties.

In summary, what is said above is generally common. Although some of the listed items have already been implemented, there are also some that have not yet been implemented. Please consider them separately to achieve perfection. As far as I can see, I have spoken briefly. I hope that the Baojia gentlemen will correct me.

### Friendship and Saint Francis Tied: West Union Football League

In the West Union Football League A Group match, Friendship faced Saint Francis. They met at Jiaozhou Park at 3:30 PM yesterday. The referee was Zhang Le. Friendship was at an absolute advantage with a score of 2-0, but Saint Francis broke through twice in a row, forcing a 2-2 draw. The second goal scored by the Saint team was a penalty kick. Zhang Le was impartial and enforced the law like a mountain. Yesterday's draw indirectly created the opportunity for the Righteous Navy to win the championship. In yesterday's game, Friendship first played with ten players. After a quarter of an hour, Meng Yiliang arrived and joined the battle. At 28 minutes, Fei Chunhua picked up the ball, Wu Qixiang passed it in the middle, and Zhuo Shijin knocked on the door. Yivano bounced it out with his chest. Zhuo rushed up and shot again, breaking through the goal and returning. Friendship took the lead with a score of 1-0 in the first half. When the battle started again, after twenty-seven minutes, Sun Jinshun took a long shot 30 yards from the back, and the ball hit Schultz's heel and rolled towards the goal. Ivano did not defend and watched it enter the net, making it 2-0. Ten minutes later, Fuen handed over Bao Za, who swept and scored, pulling back a goal. In the last two minutes, Fuen cut in and Liu Xianhan jumped up to catch it, but at this time, Zhang Lingen suddenly knocked Carrolie down, and a penalty was called. Fuen took the penalty and kicked it into the net. Time was up, and the two sides drew with a score of 2-2. In another game in the morning, the French Chamber of Commerce easily defeated Suke by a score of 4-0.

### Naval Warfare: A Dialogue

Naval Shipbuilding Vice Admiral: Kiyoshi Nagamura

Former Principal of Tokyo Higher Merchant Marine School: Kunihiko Sugawa

Asahi Weekly Reporter

Translated from the December 27th Issue of Asahi Weekly

Reporter: In such a large war, no matter which side you stand on, it is by no means just a military battle, but rather a manifestation of various forms of warfare, the most prominent of which is the so-called naval warfare. Today, I would like to seek your insights on this aspect.

From late July to late October of this year, according to the announcements of ships sunk by Japanese Navy submarines, although many enemy ships have been sunk, Japan's sacrifices have also been quite significant. Is there no way to prevent these losses due to submarine attacks?

Nagamura: The weapons used by the United States in guerrilla warfare are submarines and airplanes. Speaking of submarines, they were first used in warfare during the last World War, when Germany used this new weapon to disrupt trade and achieved great results, which was recognized by the navies of various countries. Even Britain dared not treat it lightly. Naval Marshal Jellicoe and others were deeply concerned about future submarine warfare. Therefore, Germany was very advanced in the use of submarines, and also conducted considerable research on methods of defending against submarines. In this current war, compared to the last war, the methods of submarine defense and attack have reached a groundbreaking level of progress. Furthermore, the use of other scientific advancements, such as using ultra-shortwave radio to detect the location of submarines, has also developed. Therefore, offense and defense are closely chasing each other. Because both sides are progressing, submarine guerrilla warfare is also developing accordingly.

Reporter: Judging from the number of enemy ships sunk by Germany, it is almost one million tons per month. Therefore, in light of the sinking of ships due to submarine attacks, it seems increasingly necessary to build more ships.

Nagamura: Building is one solution, preventing sinking is also a solution.

Sugawa: Speaking of ways to prevent sinking, there are methods of attack and defense, as well as detecting the location of submarines. However, what is the target of the guerrilla warfare that the enemy is desperately carrying out now? In the end, it is nothing more than merchant ships. Needless to say, warships are also their target, but warships have complete defenses. For example, small anti-submarine escorts are specifically designed to combat submarines. Therefore, submarines can only target merchant ships with very little defensive capabilities.

However, using merchant ships to transport goods is indispensable in wartime. They carry extremely important materials or necessities indispensable for the lives of the people. Therefore, ever since the First World War more than twenty years ago, it has become common sense that sinking merchant ships one by one can defeat the enemy. Merchant ships, in other words, maritime transport, are essential for achieving victory in war. The fact that ships determine the fate of a nation is even more evident in this war. Therefore, the Axis powers' navies or aircraft sink more than a million tons of ships every month for this very purpose. Although I am not an expert in tactics, I understand the principle that Germany does not need to land troops on British soil; as long as the tonnage of British ships is reduced to a certain level, Britain will be defeated. Therefore, they are intensifying their efforts to sink them.

Various Tactics to Counter Submarines

Therefore, merchant ships have also adopted various defense methods, such as so-called convoy sailing, where many ships are gathered together, and a powerful fleet follows to protect their voyage. However, this method did not seem very effective in the last European war. At that time, only one warship protected many armed merchant ships, but now it has been changed to using a large fleet for escort. However, the target of the enemy's guerrilla warfare is merchant ships sailing alone. To avoid being attacked, merchant ships have also been equipped with some kind of armament, but it is not comparable to the armament of warships. Therefore, the enemy uses them as targets. Recently, the headquarters announced that twenty-some Japanese ships have been damaged, and I think they were also targeted by this kind of guerrilla warfare. There is no other way but to quickly discover the enemy. If a torpedo is launched, air bubbles will rise to the surface of the water, forming a "white line" rushing over. By the time you discover this white line and realize that a torpedo has been launched, you know that a submarine is following. Therefore, there is no other way but to quickly discover the enemy and use your own guns to bombard them. There have already been examples of defeating the enemy using this method. There are also ways to avoid torpedoes because torpedoes drag a white line as they come. Therefore, you can quickly turn the rudder to avoid them. Also, if a submarine surfaces, you can use guns to bombard it, but the other party is very small, while you are very large, and the other party will not surface for you to see.

Therefore, judging from the guerrilla warfare in the United States, one cannot help but think that there are enemies everywhere along the Japanese coast. Therefore, whether a ship is in a Japanese port, or far away in the south, or in other ports, once it leaves the port, it cannot help but feel that there are enemy submarines lurking in the water, or mechanical mines installed, or floating on the surface. Therefore, people on merchant ships, whether crew or passengers, are really sailing at great risk.

Reporter: Is it possible to consider building ships with considerable speed so that the ships themselves are not afraid of submarine attacks? This is very necessary. This is not only good in terms of defense.

Nagamura: Needless to say, making the speed of merchant ships extremely fast is very necessary. This is not only a good method in terms of defense, but it is also a kind of attack power. However, if merchant ships are fully armed and have sufficient defensive capabilities, then merchant ships will become warships. Perhaps a few guns are missing, but they will still become almost like warships. In this way, the transport capacity will be greatly reduced. It is a solution, but quickly discovering the enemy is the most important thing.

Sugawa: Quickly discovering the enemy is certainly necessary. Similarly, it is also necessary not to be discovered by the enemy. Although it is a passive method, in the European war more than twenty years ago, there were already examples of merchant ships not emitting smoke. Therefore, there is a saying that "residual smoke is the cause of trouble." Even a thin wisp of smoke rising above the horizon will reveal that a ship is coming. Therefore, in dangerous waters where submarines are lurking, smokeless coal is used instead of bituminous coal during the day. This is a way to prevent the enemy from discovering you quickly. Also, masts are also annoying because they extend high above the ship and can be seen from afar. Even a mast as thin as a hair can be seen on the horizon, indicating that a ship is coming. Therefore, some people cut long masts short. The same goes for chimneys. Also, making the structures on the upper part of the deck small and low is also for this reason. These are means of preventing the enemy from discovering you. As for the night, blackout measures are adopted, that is, all the lights on the ship are completely extinguished, and navigation is carried out in darkness. There have also been ships sunk because of a slight leak of light. For example, a person smoking a cigarette on deck, even though the fire of the cigarette is very small, almost like a firefly, was hit by a torpedo and sank. There really have been such ships.

The Problem of Camouflage

Another solution is not to use wireless radio. Using wireless radio is extremely dangerous. The wireless radio that is sent out will be heard by others, just like speaking loudly will be heard by people nearby. If a wireless radio is sent out from a ship, any ship equipped with wireless radio equipment can hear it. After hearing it, using a direction finder to investigate can detect the location. Also, one should not speak loudly or ring bells on the ship. Avoiding these things is a way for merchant ships to protect themselves. Also, it is very dangerous to throw things that can float on the sea, such as oil and garbage, into the sea. Especially when many ships are traveling together, if you throw these things into the sea, these oil and garbage will follow the ship, dragging a long tail. Then, the traces of your passage will be left on the sea surface, which can be immediately discovered by the enemy. Therefore, any garbage that can be burned should be burned at night, and those that cannot be burned should be hammered firmly and thrown into the seabed. This method must be considered. Next is the issue of speed, but this is really the weapon of the ship. Comparing it to land, the guerrilla warfare of submarines is like a person walking in the wilderness being chased by wild dogs. Therefore, if that person runs fast, he can escape; if he does not run fast, he will be bitten by the dogs.

In the First European War, by the middle of the war, 15 million tons of ships had been sunk. According to statistics at that time, about half of the ships with a speed of about 12 knots were discovered by the enemy but managed to escape, and half were sunk. As for ships with a speed of about 6 knots, 100% were sunk. As for ships with a speed of 18 knots or more, only 3% were sunk, and the rest escaped the danger. Also, the fact that they were able to escape the danger because they discovered the enemy first or were discovered by the enemy first, or were unable to escape the danger, was also generally published in that statistic. Therefore, the saying that speed is a weapon is correct.

Next is the issue of camouflage. The so-called camouflage issue is the method of applying camouflage to the ship or changing the structure of the ship. In the previous war, there was already considerable research on this. For example, the Japanese ship "Hakuto Maru" also had camouflage. At that time, a thick line was drawn from the stern to the bow, like an upward arrow. In this way, after drawing a line behind the real bow, it looks like the bow. Therefore, the submarine made a mistake in direction at night, thinking that it was going in the opposite direction, and launched a torpedo, thus avoiding disaster. This seems a bit tricky. There have also been examples of drawing a destroyer on the side of a large ship so that it looks like there is a destroyer escorting it from a distance.

A Bomb Penetrates the Opposite Side

Nagamura: Regarding the camouflage just mentioned, the other side is also trying their best, so there are many mistakes. Another way is to sail in waters that submarines cannot reach. Another way is to sail in shallow waters or places close to land during the day where submarines cannot dive, and then sail in dangerous places at night. In addition, there are various methods, but using these passive methods only defends yourself. A further method is to use artillery to attack. Also, when encountering the enemy at extremely close range and there is no way out, the only thing to do is to scuttle the ship. There have also been such examples recently. In April of this year, there was a ship, the 〇〇 Maru, that scuttled itself in the evening. At that time, the submarine was floating and launched a torpedo, but the 〇〇 Maru avoided the torpedo and scuttled itself. Another method is to make the defense very weak and try to escape. For example, the Sado Maru was saved in this way in the Russo-Japanese War. At that time, the ship was hit by a bomb on the starboard side, but it penetrated the port side. The bomb happened to hit the coal bunker. Because the bomb had penetrated, water entered from both sides at the same time, so it sank evenly and straight, thus being saved. Originally, the power of the explosive is stronger the stronger the object it hits, and the easier it is to deal with if it hits a weaker object.

Sugawa: Next, let's talk about lookout. This is a very tense lookout. And this so-called lookout does not only refer to the lookout with the eyes, but rather the use of human senses... and even the sixth sense as much as possible. You must look out in all directions, front, back, left, and right. In recent years, you must also look at the sky, and you must have a three-dimensional lookout of the water, the surface of the water, and the sky. So it is very tense.

Also, in the last European war, great attention was paid to seagulls on the sea surface. Everyone knows that seagulls follow whales or schools of fish. Whales chase and swim to eat baleen whales and other small animals. Therefore, where there are baleen whales, there must be whales, and where there are whales, there are also birds. Moreover, seagulls also follow submarines. Therefore, where there are many seagulls gathered, there may be submarines hiding. There are many examples of using the habits of marine animals in war like this. The following is a story from the last European War.

At that time, a certain country used sea lions. Sea lions are a type of seal. After training and taming them, they can be used. During training, they are not given food to make them hungry. Then, submarines are moored near the coast for the sea lions to watch. Then, the submarine's engine is turned on, making a "rumbling" sound. At this time, the sea lions are fed so that they know that when the submarine's engine is turned on, they can get food. Then, the submarine is driven away from the coast, and the sea lions are left on land. Then, the submarine's engine is turned on again. When the sea lions hear the engine sound, they think they can get food, and they immediately jump into the sea and swim to the submarine. After swimming to the submarine, they are given food. Again, the submarine dives into the water, and the sea lions are carried in a small motorboat. A red float the size of a cigarette is tied to the sea lions' bodies. When the submarine turns on its engine and dives, the sea lions immediately jump into the sea and swim towards the diving submarine. The small motorboat follows the sea lions' floats. By training sea lions in this way, using their innate hearing, they are able to find the location of submarines. After the location of the submarine is known, the sea lions are pulled up, and then a depth charge is launched. That method has been used before.

The United States' Shipbuilding Should Not Be Underestimated

Reporter: Although there are those defense methods, in the end, you still cannot avoid suffering considerable damage from submarines. Then, the so-called naval warfare has to be formally adopted. Is it possible that the United States can build eight million tons of ships per year?

Nagamura: I don't know if it's true. However, the so-called eight million tons in the United States refers to dead weight, while the sunken ships are expressed in tons. Therefore, the number of tons built should be more than the number of tons sunk. Comparing the two, the number of tons built should be discounted by 30%. Therefore, the so-called eight million tons built should actually be regarded as within six million tons. However, there is no doubt that they are trying their best to build them. (To be continued)

### Frugal Plans for Oil and Sugar

— Mu Wen

There are probably not many people who can eat plain rice. They still have to eat some side dishes with their rice, no matter how much or how good the side dishes are.

It also doesn't seem very good to cook vegetables with just water. You still have to use some oil. For the sake of color and taste, you have to add some sugar. People in Shanghai especially like fatty and sweet side dishes. So you can't do without oil and sugar when cooking side dishes (we are not discussing nutrition here).

Currently in Shanghai, you have to "squeeze" to buy oil and sugar. What if you can't squeeze? Rich people have ways. Lard can be freely purchased, both raw and cooked, at twenty-some yuan per catty. However, animal oil is not as fatty as vegetable oil for cooking, and it solidifies when cold. Vegetable oil is still indispensable. A friend of mine told me that a family bought fifty catties of vegetable oil from a secret market at a price of twenty-five yuan per catty, totaling one thousand two hundred and fifty yuan! As for sugar, the sub-landlord can buy forty yuan worth of sugar at a time with the rent donation ticket, whether or not to distribute it to the tenants is another matter. If not, there may still be ways to buy rock sugar. Only those families who can barely afford to eat a bowl of rice and a small side dish are troubled. The housewife has no oil and no sugar for cooking, so she can only sigh at the pot. As for those who can't even afford to eat, oil and sugar have become problems they can't even worry about.

Recently, I have gained interesting experiences from those friends who are good at planning: they use fried dough sticks to stir-fry vegetables and add sweet potatoes to flour to make cakes, just to get some oil and taste some sweetness (eating sweet potatoes alone is another matter). Poor friends really have their frugal plans!

### This Month

— Yuan Liduan

— Written by a fifteen-year-old child —

Although the sun that rises from the east every morning is still the same as yesterday's, and its shape has never changed for tens of millions of years, you cannot deny that this is a new day just because its appearance will not change, and you must tear off your calendar.

The calendar is torn page by page, torn and torn, and one book after another is torn. I don't know how many calendars have been torn since the beginning of time. Now, the calendar for the 31st year hanging on the wall is about to be torn off, leaving only a few thin pages. The time when sweet osmanthus fragrantly falls and chrysanthemums are yellow and crabs are fat has passed in the blink of an eye. It seems like the road signs on the road of life have quickly gone far away, getting smaller and smaller, and finally disappearing. What is blocking in front is the cold winter at the end of the year with the biting north wind.

Facing December, this end of the year, what kind of feelings will you have? Perhaps you will let out a sigh of "What, another year has passed?" and feel infinite emotion about the fleeting years. You feel that this year has really been wasted, and there has been no harvest or significant progress in any aspect. And time is pressing, and in the blink of an eye, you will be growing older in vain. Perhaps looking at this remaining calendar, you will lazily lose the motivation to do anything. "Let it be! Anyway, the year is about to end. Whatever needs to be done, leave it for next year. You can't do anything in this short period of time."

At the beginning of each period, we always deal with it with great concentration. However, even at the end, we should not be slack in the slightest. This month allows us to reflect on what we have done in the past year to serve as a mirror for the next year; on the other hand, it also allows us to set a plan for the coming year so that we can start working on it in a down-to-earth manner as soon as the year begins.

The situation is just like the presentation of a film's title card. Everyone wants to talk about the plot of the film and the acting skills of the leading actors. If anyone doesn't know, he cannot be called a fashionable person. But the presentation of the film only arouses the appreciation and attention of a part of the people. There are many people who are willing to be out of fashion and ignore it. But the fashion of talking about the rice problem is much better than a film masterpiece. This grand occasion is really unprecedented, and from this unprecedented grand occasion, we can see how serious the rice problem is. Especially after entering this month, the price of rice has been rising endlessly. Adding to the unavailability of oil and sugar, it is really difficult for people in Shanghai to live.

The most helpless, of course, are those poor people. Under the high pressure of life, they have long been on the verge of death. How can they withstand the attack of the cold? Hunger is burning their hearts, the north wind is piercing their bones, and they are groaning and moaning. They are pitiful worms who spend their mornings and evenings as if they were years. They are everywhere on the streets. I don't believe that they are all people who did not cultivate themselves in their previous lives. Which of these shivering and crying people is not our sister or brother? We are compatriots and cannot bear to see them die. Alas! "How can I get ten thousand rooms to shelter all the poor people in the world and make them happy!" Although Du Fu had such a heart, he did not have such strength, so it was futile. Now there must be many people in society who have this power. Who would be willing to help others as they would help themselves, to extend the wish to relieve all sufferings and save all people? I am really filled with sincere prayers!

In this month, there is naturally no vitality in the natural world. There is no abundance of peaches and plums, no beauty of peonies and peonies, no freshness of lotus, no charm of chrysanthemums; even the subtle fragrance of plum blossoms is still not heard. Why don't we sow and irrigate our sympathy and love at any time, so that it can sprout, grow, and bloom beautiful and delicate flowers in the cold, icy, frosty, and bare December?

### Memories of Yantai

— You Guiying

Yantai, what a symbolic name! Here, the heavens do not like to rain, but love to blow the wind. Sitting quietly in a small room, listening carefully to the pine waves like the cries of monkeys and tigers, it is like being surrounded by hundreds of beasts, which makes people shudder. Wandering on the hillside in the early morning, what is presented in front of you is like a kaleidoscope of changes. The thin mist shrouds the sleepy high mountains, and the floating clouds densely cover the vast and boundless sea. The drunken wind embraces the dancing yellow sand, and the solitary chimneys spit out black demons from their mouths, forming long snakes in the sky. Smoke, clouds, fog, and sand form a gray world.

Liugong Island is simple, bold, tragic, and deep; Zhifu Mountain is beautiful, gentle, clear, and winding. The yellow sand of Xisha Bay is better than the vast Gobi Desert, and the cherry blossoms of Sincun are no different from a paradise. The charming Yantai Mountain overlooks the majestic Yantai Mountain, like a beautiful woman and a hero, complementing each other. The Yantai Middle School, known as the highest institution of learning, occupies the peak of Yuhuangding alone, seemingly disregarding everything and arrogant.

On a moonlit night, strolling on the long dyke of Bohai Bay, appreciating the high tides of more than ten feet, surging and vast, overwhelming the mountains and seas, one will naturally feel the greatness and wonder of nature.

Often on a calm morning, in the faint white mist, you can actually see miracles such as "castles in the air" or "mirages."

Although Yantai is not as rich as Qingdao, it has a simple charm. Those slow camels, simple people, and majestic mountains and rivers will always give me endless memories.

### Correction of the Location of Lu Xun's Tomb

— Ren Yan

In Mr. Baihong's "Street Anecdotes" on December 23, the origins of the names of roads and statues of gods and figures of foreigners in the concession are described in detail, which is helpful for understanding the anecdotes and history of Shanghai. I am deeply impressed. The stone statues in front of the stables on the Mahe Road and Jing'an Temple Road, which are said to be the Weng Zhong in front of Lu Xun's tomb, and the area is said to be the site of Lu Xun's tomb, cannot but be doubted. According to: Lu Xun, whose style name was Boyan, lived in the Three Kingdoms period; Lu Shen, whose style name was Yanshan, lived in the Ming Hongzhi period. Shen's pronunciation is close to Xun, so the people of the county often mistakenly attributed the deeds of the local predecessors to Lu Boyan, not knowing that the times were separated by nearly 1,300 years. According to today's research, Lu Xun's tomb is in Hengyun Mountain, and Lu Shen's tomb is in Pudong, which has nothing to do with the cemetery next to Jing'an Temple. Lu Xun's position is not comparable to that of Cao Cao, so it is not necessary to set up another tomb outside the main tomb. Moreover, the style of the stone statues is completely different from the statues of the Han and Jin Dynasties, which can be seen at a glance. I am afraid that if it is not carefully examined, the truth of the facts will be contradicted, so I correct it.

### Sharing a Boat in Stormy Weather

— He Jia Zhi

12. "The Rear Courtyard Flower"

Wei Cheng said, "We have things to say, let's talk after we leave the city streets."  He said this and ran straight ahead, with Huang Long following behind. Neither of them spoke a word. In the blink of an eye, they reached the edge of the city, and some dawn light was beginning to appear in the east. Wei Cheng sat down beside an old tree with tangled roots by the roadside and shook his head, saying, "I'm afraid I've bled too much." He raised his arm for Huang Long to see. Huang Long showed no pity for him and didn't sit down either, but exhaled and said, "Too much bleeding? Who told you to bleed?" Wei Cheng said, "I was thinking..." Huang Long said, "You've been thinking for days, and you're still thinking? Fine, you're willing to use your own flesh to replace the flesh of those little bastards surnamed Cheng. This is what you've thought up after so many days. No need for further words, the knife is mine, not yours, and I can't let you use my knife to stab your flesh. Give it here!" Huang Long didn't even bother to ask for Wei Cheng's agreement and took the knife from Wei Cheng's hand, smelling it on his nose. Wei Cheng turned his head and called out, "Brother Long," Huang Long replied, "Goodbye, Brother Long." Huang Long walked forward without any reluctance. Wei Cheng held one hand over the wound on the other arm, stood up, and called out, "Brother Long, where are you going?" Huang Long didn't answer, but kept walking forward.

How could Wei Cheng outpace Huang Long? At first, they were only a few yards apart, but gradually the distance grew to more than ten yards, and gradually only a shadow could be seen, and gradually even the shadow disappeared. Wei Cheng looked at his body in the dawn light, but couldn't see any obvious bloodstains, and he couldn't walk as fast as before. As he walked, he thought, "Did Guo Fang open her eyes for a moment just now? I wonder if she woke up in her sleep and saw me and Huang Long? Assuming she saw me and Huang Long, she would definitely have cried out. Since there was no sound, she must not have seen us." Thinking this, Wei Cheng felt a little calmer and ran forward again. Then he thought, "He suddenly remembered that when Huang Long stabbed the knife down, it pierced through the quilt of Guo Qi; the second knife stabbed into my arm, and my blood flowed out at that moment. Guo Fang's bed must also be stained with blood, so Guo Fang's surprise when she wakes up is self-evident. Moreover, the door was opened and not closed, so it can be said that she will think that there was an assassin, no matter what."

### Darwin's Letters on Biology (Part Two)

— Lincoln Schuster, Translated by Gu Xin

—One of the Letters of World Famous Scientists—

On October 15, 1859, Darwin wrote to Thomas Huxley from Yorkshire, saying: "I am here undergoing water treatment. After I finished that cursed book (On the Origin of Species), I was reborn. This book may be easy work for others, but for me, it almost cost me half my life... I dare not ask you to believe my many heresies."

Finally, in 1859, Darwin's epoch-making masterpiece was finally published in 1859. The title of the book is "On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection" or "Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle of Life." The first edition of 1,250 copies was sold out on the day of publication.

In the following letter, we can roughly see the examination, verification, and creative thinking in all of Darwin's work.

"Determined to publish a small essay on the origin of mankind..."

Text

My Dear Wallace,—Bates is quite right: you are the person others turn to when they encounter difficulties. Apart from your opinion (note), I have never heard a more ingenious opinion, and I hope you can prove its truth. Speaking of the facts about white moths, it is very touching, and seeing a theory almost being proven really warms the blood. Regarding the beauty of male butterflies, I still want to think that this is for sexual selection. Dragonflies are all attracted by bright colors, and there is some evidence; however, what causes the above belief is that many orthopteran and cicada-like animals have musical organs. For this reason, I also believe that in sexual selection, the situation of birds is the same as the color of insects. I hope I have the strength and time to do the several experiments you want to show, but I think butterflies cannot be detained. I have indeed heard of such difficulties. Many years ago, I had a dragonfly painted with bright colors, but I never had the opportunity to test it properly.

Now I feel a great interest in sexual selection, because I have almost decided to publish a small essay on the origin of mankind, and I still strongly think (although I cannot make you believe, and this point is the most important possible blow to me), that sexual selection is the active agent in forming the human race.

By the way, here is another topic that I want to introduce into my essay, that is, the expression of the face. Now, by chance, do you know a very kind, clever observer in the Malay Sea who can give me some convenient opinions on the faces of Malays when they are aroused by emotions? If there is such a person, I will send him a questionnaire. Thank you for your most interesting letter.

Most Sincerely Yours, Charles Darwin

Down, February 26, (1867)

(Note) Those butterfly moths and butterflies are not eaten by birds because they are easily recognized and easily discarded, so they are preserved.

Consequences

One year after this letter was written, in 1868, Darwin greatly expanded on the topic discussed in this letter and wrote an article entitled "Variations of Animals and Plants Under Domestication." Finally, "The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex" was also published by Darwin in 1871, which was also a problem touched upon in this letter written in 1867.

Regarding religion, Darwin said: "The feeling of disbelief entered my heart at a very slow pace, but finally it was completed. The progress was so slow that I did not feel pain." (End of this issue)
