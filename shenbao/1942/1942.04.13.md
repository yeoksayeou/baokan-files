### England Still Willing to Assist India in Moving Towards Freedom: Cripps' Broadcast Before Returning Home Explains the Course of Negotiations with India

New Delhi, 12th (Reuters) - Sir Stafford Cripps, the British special envoy to India, stated in a broadcast to the Indian people last night, "The proposals I brought on behalf of the War Cabinet have been rejected by your leaders. You are aware that this excellent opportunity to unite India, strengthen its defenses, and secure its freedom has been missed, which I deeply regret. Adjusting the relationship between Britain and the various ethnic groups in India has been extremely difficult historically, and the difficulties among the various groups in India are even greater. No one is more aware of this than I am. The War Cabinet sent me to India, fully aware that while Indian public opinion unanimously desires complete self-government, opinions on how to achieve it are highly divided. It is these divergent opinions that we sought to address."

Divergent Opinions Among Factions: Difficult Reconciliation Work

Since the beginning of the war, the Indian National Congress has consistently demanded two things as the basis for aiding the Allied powers in the war effort: 1. the declaration of Indian independence; 2. the convening of a national assembly to draft a free constitution for India. The War Cabinet drew on these demands as a model to draft a declaration, so that all ethnic groups in India and world opinion would believe that the War Cabinet was sincere in wanting India to achieve freedom as soon as practically possible. To avoid past criticisms, the War Cabinet also put forward a clear and straightforward plan, so that the establishment of an autonomous government in India would not be obstructed by the differing opinions of one faction. The War Cabinet was also willing to listen if the leaders of all parties and factions in India wished to negotiate other solutions among themselves, even if one party favored a plan that met its own opinions while being rejected by other parties. Therefore, the War Cabinet found itself in the position of an arbitrator, seeking a fair compromise among the opinions of all parties and factions. The War Cabinet could not deny that the freedom it offered to India must impose a certain political system upon the various ethnic groups in India, which the wartime cabinet was not free to choose. After this plan was put forward, all parties and factions nitpicked, fearing to be left behind. However, the most important part of the plan, the establishment of a fully free autonomous government in India, was unanimously approved by all parties and factions, but has not been mentioned. This kind of nitpicking attitude, though common in courts and markets, is not the best policy for those who wish to settle disputes and appease people. If India wants to establish a strong and free nation, a compromise is indispensable. It is my belief that one day, all parties and factions in India will find a way to negotiate a method for drafting a new constitution among themselves. I love India deeply, and I am saddened to see this opportunity missed. However, this concerns India's future.

India's Defense Issues: Proposals Not Adopted

The current difficulties cannot be ignored, and one of these difficulties is defense. The British government's attitude towards this is very simple. For over a hundred years, the defense of the Indian government has been under the control of the British government, and for over twenty years, this responsibility has been held by a British-appointed Commander-in-Chief. The Indian Commander-in-Chief is also the Defense Member of the Viceroy's Executive Council, commanding the Indian Army (including British and Indian troops), Navy, and Air Force. The Indian side requested that the defense of India should be controlled by Indians, but no one argued that the Commander-in-Chief should be subordinate to the Indian government. Instead, the argument was that the powers of the Commander-in-Chief as the Defense Member of the Viceroy's Executive Council should be transferred to an Indian. This seemed simple at first glance, but was very difficult to reorganize and could not be done in a short time. In this emergency, any delay would be dangerous. The British government has a responsibility to protect India in the war and also has obligations to the United States, which has provided much assistance. Clearly, it would not be appropriate to rashly agree to this. To show our sincerity, we also put forward a new proposal, advocating for the establishment of a new combat department, to which all matters between the government, the Commander-in-Chief's office, and the Navy and Air Force commands would be transferred. The position of minister would be filled by the Commander-in-Chief in the capacity of a combat member, and other important defense tasks would be handled by an Indian Defense Member. Some parties in India expressed satisfaction with this proposal, but the National Congress still had objections, demanding a certain degree of jurisdiction over the Indian Defense Member. This action would be detrimental to the Allied war effort in India.

Letter from the Indian National Congress: Negotiations Ultimately Fail

However, these matters were not the real reason for the breakdown of negotiations. In the last letter from the Congress Standing Committee, it was stated that the wartime provisional government made it impossible for them to participate. They also put forward two remedial suggestions: one was to immediately change the constitution, which was proposed at the last moment and could not be implemented at all during the war, as everyone else admitted. The second was that they were prepared to join a truly national government, whose cabinet would be composed of Indian leaders, free from any control by the Viceroy or the British cabinet. The British side understood the meaning of these suggestions, which was that a number of people elected by Indian parties would manage India indefinitely, not responsible to the legislature or the electorate, and could not be replaced. Many of these people would be in a position to rule over minority ethnic groups. It is easy to see that this plan would not be accepted by the major minority ethnic groups in India. Furthermore, the British government had given these minority ethnic groups assurances that they would not be deprived of protection under the sole or hostile rule of the majority ethnic groups, as this would violate all the guarantees we had made. The Congress Party's solution may seem simple and touching to those who do not understand the deep divisions among religious groups in India, but in reality, it is completely impractical and would never be accepted by the majority of the Indian people. The Congress Party argued that without such changes, they could not lead the Indian people.

India Urgently Needs National Unity and Solidarity

What India needs most today is the unity of all leaders from major parties and ethnic groups to serve in a national government. Any plan accepted by some but rejected by others is of little value, and the exact method is irrelevant. Inspiring and leading the people does not depend on methods or agreements, unless the leaders are united and have a common determination to implement them, it will not work. If the Congress Party leaders feel they can unite with other leaders, then the great work will be completed. One thing that must be clarified is that I am solely responsible for what I have done in India. Neither the Viceroy nor the Commander-in-Chief bear any responsibility for these negotiations, but they have done their best to assist me. I express my sincere gratitude to both of them and to all those of various nationalities who have assisted me. We tried to use the proposals I brought to help India move towards victory and freedom, but it has now been proven that past distrust is too strong, and a compromise cannot be reached at present. We are not pained by the failure to achieve results, as our efforts were made in good faith. No one has questioned the sincerity of our main purpose for India, which is to make India completely free. This effort, motivated by goodwill and sincerity, will be recorded in the history of Anglo-Indian relations and will radiate benevolence to the future, further proving that it is the first step forward on the road to Indian freedom and Anglo-Indian friendship.

Hope India Can Contribute to Establishing Lasting Peace

Although we still have major tasks in other areas, we will do our best, and the United States will give us even greater assistance, to help India defend its land. As we seek to help them, we ask them to join us and the Soviet Union with vast manufacturing power, commensurate with the unlimited manpower of the Allied nations. The result will be victory. For this victory, India can and must make a great contribution. The heroic people of the world will have an unprecedented opportunity to transform the world in the future. The Indian people and their leaders must also be prepared to do their best in establishing world order. We must take risks, we must try innovation, and we must quickly break away from the customs of peacetime. A new speed of action is necessary in the effort to end the horrors of war as soon as possible. I have seen the Soviet Union's efforts in the war, and I have seen the Chinese army, lacking many major supplies, steadfastly fighting. Now it is time for India and its people to throw courage, strength, and perseverance into the great and heroic global civilian army. This victory will forever free the people from years of fear and the tragedies of poverty and war.

U.S. Expresses Deep Concern About Anglo-Indian Relations

Washington, 12th (Havas) - Acting Secretary of State Welles told reporters today that Colonel Johnson, President Roosevelt's special envoy to India, reported the developments to the State Department regarding the failure of the British Lord Privy Seal Cripps' trip to India. Whether the United States will take any action depends on whether the U.S. government will continue negotiations with Indian leaders.

New Delhi, 12th (Reuters) - Nehru, the former president of the Indian National Congress, met again with Colonel Johnson, President Roosevelt's personal secretary, this morning. According to Nehru, Colonel Johnson suggested that he travel to the United States, but he has decided not to go to the United States at this time.

Indian National Congress Schedules Delegate Congress

Saigon, 12th (Haitong News Agency) - The Executive Committee of the Indian National Congress has scheduled a congress to be held in Allahabad on April 29. Approximately 8,000 delegates will participate. The Executive Committee has 300 members. It is expected that an important event will be announced.

Stockholm, Sweden, 12th (Haitong News Agency) - According to Gandhi, when speaking to British reporters, regarding the situation of the breakdown of Anglo-Indian negotiations, one can inquire with the President of the National Congress. Gandhi stated that he did not participate in the discussions of the party's Executive Committee.

Development of the Indian Situation: Two Possible Consequences

London, 11th (Havas) - A certain Indian jurist recently made a statement to a Reuters reporter, stating that after the Indian National Congress rejected the British proposal, two consequences may occur in the future. One is that the National Congress will listen to India maintaining the status quo. If so, Britain can continue to devote itself to the war as usual, without encountering any obstacles. The second is that the party decides to launch a movement to implement its usual主張. If this happens, the Muslims, known for their fighting prowess, will inevitably rise up and follow suit, and the result will likely lead to a serious situation.

### Japanese Army and Air Force Begin Fierce Attack on Corregidor; Part of the Japanese Army Lands on Cebu Island

Manila, 11th (Domei News Agency) - After defeating 70,000 American and Filipino troops on the Bataan Peninsula, the Japanese army, since the afternoon of the 10th, has again dispatched a large number of aircraft and cannons to launch a three-dimensional attack on the fortress of Corregidor, in cooperation with the army and air force.

Tokyo, 12th (Domei News Agency) - It is reported that the Japanese troops who landed on Cebu Island (Philippines) on Friday morning, in close cooperation with the Navy, have completely occupied Cebu City, releasing 238 Japanese residents who were detained. Other Japanese troops who landed at Baleri on the west coast of the island defeated the enemy forces in the mountains and occupied Saki at 2:00 PM on Friday. The retreating American and Filipino troops are now planning to make a last-ditch defense in the mountains of Cebu Island.

Bataan Frontline, 12th (Domei News Agency) - It has been revealed that the Japanese column that invaded the Bataan Peninsula broke into Mariveles, the last stronghold of the American and Filipino forces at the southern tip of the peninsula, at 9:00 PM on Thursday and has now completely occupied the area.

### President of Indian National Congress Writes to Cripps Again: If Britain Does Not Abandon Its Divide-and-Rule Policy, It Will Be Difficult to Obtain Full Cooperation from India

New Delhi, 11th (Reuters) - Acharya Kripalani, President of the Indian National Congress, recently wrote back to Cripps, explaining the National Congress's decision on the British proposal, stating, "We believe that if the British government does not implement policies that encourage division, all Indian people, regardless of party or faction, will be able to unite and take unified action. Unfortunately, at this critical moment, the British government has been unable to abandon its divide-and-rule policy. We cannot help but believe that the British government's emphasis on ruling India and its policy of division exceeds its concern for India's defense against foreign enemies. What our party and all Indian people value most is India's defense and India's security. We believe that this issue is a touchstone of Britain's policy towards India. The British government's opinion seems to lack trust in the Indian people. The Indian people believe that the issue of defense is a national issue, requiring the unified participation of Indian men and women, and is a manifestation of trust in our Indian people and seeking their full cooperation in the great war effort. Unless the Indian people can feel their own responsibility, the British government's responsibility for defense will be difficult to effectively implement. Your letter states that the National Congress has agreed not to make legal changes during the war period, which the National Congress must deny and correct your impression. During the negotiations, the British government's attitude seemed to be gradually deteriorating. You told me that a national government would be established, with powers similar to a cabinet, and the position of the Governor-General would be similar to the position of the British King towards his cabinet. Regarding the issue of the India Office, you told me that no one had mentioned this important event, which was surprising, and that it would be merged into the Dominion Affairs Office. The plan you gave us completely tore up the way to solve this problem in my last meeting with you, that is, organizing a mixed cabinet and cooperating sincerely. We can only accept this method. What we care about is not the National Congress Party gaining power, but all Indians gaining freedom and power."

### Cripps Exerts Himself for the Country: British Prime Minister Sends a Thank You Telegram

London, 11th (Havas) - Prime Minister Churchill recently sent a telegram to Sir Stafford Cripps, thanking him for his efforts in India, stating, "Although your persistent spirit and hope for the establishment of an Anglo-Indian agreement have not been fulfilled at present, your exertions for the country have been of great merit and have laid the foundation for the future progress of the Indian people."

### British Newspaper Commentary

London, 11th (Reuters) - The Sunday edition of The Times stated, "We are deeply disappointed by the failure of Cripps' trip to India, but we are not surprised by the evolution of the attitude of the Indian National Congress. The current authorities have withdrawn the plan they specially proposed, but the policy on which it is based remains firm. Therefore, whenever India wishes to reopen negotiations, they can be reopened. "The Sunday edition of The Observer commented, "India's defense is now the full responsibility of the British government, but the government needs assistance, just as the Indian politicians see it. What they see may be clearer than we do, that is, the failure of defense will also harm the Indian people themselves."

### Britain Plans to Open a Second Front in Europe: Various Preparations Have Been Completed, and Turkey's Movements Are Worth Watching

Switzerland, 12th (Havas) - Regarding the various situations of the future spring offensive, the opening of a second front, the prospects of the German-Soviet war, and Turkey's movements are the three things that the diplomatic community is most concerned about. According to the Basel News's correspondent in London, there is now a movement in Britain advocating the opening of a second front in Europe. It is said that various preparations have been completed for the purpose of achieving this goal. As for Germany's plans, it seems impossible for the country to end the war on the Soviet side within the year, but the Axis powers can launch fierce attacks on other fronts before launching a spring offensive. If the German army attacks in Libya in North Africa on one side and invades Southeast Europe on the other to encircle Egypt and the Suez Canal, the Allied positions in the Mediterranean will be even more threatened. Although Britain has declared that it will do its best to defend the Middle East, given the various setbacks in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, it is doubtful whether the British army is sufficient to resist the concentrated attack in the Mediterranean, and even the attack on the Persian Gulf.

### Oshima Arrives in Bulgaria

Sofia, Bulgaria, 11th (Havas) - Japanese Ambassador to Germany General Oshima, after visiting various countries in Central Europe and Southeast Europe, arrived here today and plans to stay here for a few days before going to Athens and then returning to his post in Berlin via this place. Japanese Ambassador to Turkey Kurihara has also arrived here and will discuss matters with Ambassador Oshima.

### New Bulgarian Cabinet Established

Sofia, Bulgaria, 11th (Havas) - After King Boris returned from his visit to Berlin, he began to reorganize the cabinet. The new cabinet was established today. Prime Minister Filov, Minister of Interior Gabrovski, and Minister of Finance Botsilov were all re-elected. The remaining cabinet ministers are all pro-Axis elements. The full list of cabinet members is as follows: Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs: Filov (re-elected); Minister of Interior: Gabrovski (re-elected); Minister of Finance: Botsilov (re-elected); Minister of the Army: General Mihov (new appointment); Minister of Justice: Batdov (new appointment); Minister of Education: Hottov (new appointment); Minister of Railways and Posts: Raydev (new appointment); Minister of Commerce: Chaiharev (new appointment); Minister of Public Works: Vasilev (new appointment).

This cabinet reshuffle, with the replacement of many cabinet members, is sufficient to strengthen Bulgaria's relations with the Axis powers. The appointment of General Mihov as Minister of the Army is especially welcomed by Germany and Italy.

### Tatekawa Returns to Tokyo

Tokyo, 12th (Domei News Agency) - Tatekawa, the former ambassador to the Soviet Union, returned to Tokyo Station at around 3:00 PM today. Many friends, including Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Nishi, Minister of Interior Yuzawa, and Special Envoy to Vietnam Aizawa, were at the station to welcome him.

### Turkey's Foreign Policy Reported to Be Changing: Anglo-Soviet Relations with Turkey Hanging by a Thread

Switzerland, (Havas) - Tribune de Geneve recently published a dispatch from its correspondent in Rome, stating that Turkey's foreign policy will undergo a major change in late May or early June. The country has taken various measures politically and militarily to cope with all possible contingencies, and Turkish dignitaries also know Germany's views on the spring offensive. According to the Italian newspaper Il Giornale d'Italia, Britain and the Soviet Union will sever diplomatic relations with Turkey within six or seven weeks. It is noted that German Ambassador to Turkey Papen recently returned to the country to report on his work, and Turkish Ambassador to Germany Kircher returned to the country to discuss with the government before hurriedly returning to Berlin. In addition, Japanese Ambassador to Germany Oshima is traveling to various countries in Southeast Europe, and Japanese Ambassador to Turkey Kurihara went to Sofia to meet with Oshima. All of these factors indicate that Turkey will adopt a new stance in the shortest possible time.

### Price Control Committees of the Two Concessions Vigorously Seek to Suppress Prices: Strive to Open Up Sources of Goods, and Crack Down on Illegal Black Market Transactions

The Price Control Committees of the Two Concessions are sparing no effort in suppressing prices and stabilizing the commercial market. In view of the unpredictable intentions of merchants, who may secretly raise prices and deceive the citizens, they constantly dispatch personnel to various shops or firms to take away accounting books for thorough inspection. Hundreds of cases have been found where goods sold and purchased daily were not sold at the limited price, and penalties have been imposed. Currently, the price control committees of the two authorities, in view of the fact that if prices are not urgently suppressed, it will be difficult for the residents of the city to make a living, which is not only related to social order but also hinders the restoration of the commercial market, are still actively negotiating various specific measures. Therefore, those responsible for each committee are in frequent contact. It is heard that the committees will address the issue of suppressing prices from the root cause, starting with opening up sources, cracking down on manipulation and monopolies, and striving for the restoration of normal transactions as scheduled.

Strive to Revitalize Various Industries

It is also learned that the committee members believe that revitalizing the entire industry and commerce of Shanghai is not only an urgent matter that cannot be delayed but also their inescapable responsibility. However, this matter is significant, and the committees find it difficult to do it alone. They must have the cooperation of all parties to advance hand in hand, and eliminate all kinds of illegal transactions so that the supply of goods tends to be balanced. It is found that the factors of the depression and stagnation of industry and commerce in the city are approximately: 1. After the war, land and water transportation in various places was stagnant, and goods could not be transported to Shanghai to meet the market; 2. Black market transactions were rampant, and prices frequently increased; 3. The cost of living increased sharply, the livelihood of citizens was difficult, and purchasing power was increasingly weakened; 4. The authorities' sanctions against unscrupulous merchants were ineffective.

Eager to Suppress Prices of Daily Necessities

Regarding the selling price of various daily necessities, it has now soared to the highest peak ever seen. The root cause should be the rampant speculation and the illegal hoarding and monopoly of unscrupulous merchants. Although the authorities have repeatedly ordered and strictly cracked down, the effect is very rare. To this day, not only are ordinary people unable to maintain their livelihoods, but there is even a risk of cutting off wages and sources of income, and the wealthy class also have a sigh of relief. However, although the two concession authorities are still racking their brains and striving to advance in the work of suppressing prices, they should proceed with suppressing the selling prices of daily necessities first. Otherwise, the authorities will not be able to take credit for their past efforts, and the residents of the city will not be able to benefit from them. Would it not be in name only? Therefore, suppressing the selling prices of daily necessities is a matter of utmost urgency.

Black Market Transactions Must Be Eliminated

Furthermore, black market transactions in various markets in the city have not yet been eliminated. If black market transactions continue to exist, it will be difficult for the selling price of goods to fall. It is found that all the shops in the city sell the required goods on a daily basis, which are supplied by the market operators of each industry. The market operators are responsible for supplying goods and do not also sell them at the door. However, since 1937, this kind of legitimate transaction has been invisibly suspended, and the evil trend of hoarding and reselling goods for profit has become increasingly rampant. Those who participate in black market transactions all flock to it, and unscrupulous merchants all aim to raise prices for profit. Since the authorities are planning to suppress prices, black market transactions should be cracked down on, so that it can be twice the result with half the effort.

### Ningbo Natives Gradually Repatriated

More Than 17,000 People Have Returned to Ningbo

After the Naruto Maru ran aground outside Zhenhai Port on its way from Shanghai to Ningbo, it is now learned that the ship has not been towed to Ningbo or Shanghai. The Changshan Maru, which replaced the ship, has been postponed to leave Shanghai for Ningbo on the 15th. The current schedule of the ship is intended to not include passengers. The number of sailing ships between Shanghai and Ningbo is endless, and approximately more than 1,000 people leave Shanghai and return to their hometowns every day. As a result, the population of Ningbo has surged, and the local work teams are providing care for them. The empty houses in the city have also been rented out, and the situation in Ningbo City has become much more prosperous. As for the Ningbo work team that takes care of the fellow villagers who evacuated from Shanghai to Ningbo, the work situation in March is announced as follows: A total of 22 ships arrived in Ningbo, carrying 17,118 passengers, including 5,025 in the city, 5,310 in Yin Village, 1,968 in Yuyao, 1,805 in Cixi, 1,507 in Fenghua, and 1,303 in Zhenhai, totaling 17,118 people. There were 7,006 merchants, 109 farmers, 1,932 coolies, and 90 unemployed refugees (excluding women and children). 757 refugees were rescued or treated preferentially by the work team.

### Chinese Drug Exhibition Opens Yesterday, Inaugurated by French Consul-General

The Chinese Drug Exhibition, prepared by French botany doctorate Reverend Wang Xingyi and Aurora University Professor Wu Yunrui, was officially inaugurated yesterday afternoon at the Aurora University Museum by French Consul-General Mr. Mager, with a large crowd of visitors. The exhibition showcases various Chinese drugs from ancient times to the present, with the aim of informing the public of the important role these Chinese drugs play in the modern medical field. The visitors yesterday were personally received by Aurora University President Reverend Father Maan, and a large number of staff members were on hand to explain the details of each exhibit to the audience. The purpose of the exhibition is to demonstrate to the public the contribution of Chinese drugs to modern and recent medical work, and to display a number of preparations derived from Chinese herbs and animals for viewing. The exhibition is divided into several sections to represent the different properties of various drugs, as well as various superstitions and miraculous objects that the Chinese believe can prolong life. The largest part of the exhibition displays drugs that have been used by the Chinese for centuries and have been chemically tested by European and American scientists and found to be effective in treating diseases. Among the most noteworthy is a Chinese prescription for treating epilepsy, which is the best of all methods of treating epilepsy in the scientific community. In addition, many drugs that are generally considered experimental and unimportant are also on display, with explanations to illustrate their usage and properties. Another section displays various plants and foods that the Chinese believe can prolong life. The exhibition is open daily to the public for viewing and does not charge admission.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Holds Cholera Vaccination Campaign

The Shanghai Municipal Council's Information Office issued a statement saying that the council published a notice today detailing the measures for the free cholera vaccination campaign to be conducted by the Health Department starting today (Monday, April 13). All Chinese citizens and foreigners unable to afford private medical vaccination can go for the injection. The locations are set up in a total of nine health sub-offices, four in the Western District, two each in the Central and Eastern Districts, and one in the Northern District. The addresses of each sub-office and their vaccination hours are listed in the notice. The notice also asks all employers to note that those who wish to request mobile vaccination vehicles to vaccinate their employees can contact the respective sub-offices. However, this measure only applies to businesses, factories, etc., that wish to vaccinate 100 or more employees simultaneously. These employers can contact the nearest health sub-office in writing.

### Rice Office Continues to Release Rice Today

The foreign rice designated by the Shanghai Municipal Council's Rice Office for extraction from Siemens, Fuxin, Taikoo, and other godowns had not been fully released the day before and must continue to be extracted today. Since last week, the allocation of foreign rice to rice shops in both concessions has increased. However, the amount increased for rice shops in the French Concession this week will be reduced, while the Public Concession will continue to increase as usual for sale.

### Robbery on Haining Road

Chairman Wang Shouqun delivered the opening remarks, and guests such as Zhang Zhuqing gave speeches. Subsequently, the meeting discussed matters related to the association's operations. Finally, a photograph was taken, and the meeting adjourned.

### Rong Wu Society Scripture Lecture, 38th and 39th Sessions

At the 38th session of the Rong Wu Scripture Society's National Language Lecture Series, Mr. Shen Juelin lectured on the summary of the third to sixth paragraphs of the ancient version of The Great Learning. He said that in the third paragraph, "身有之身" (shen you zhi shen, the body that one has), the Four Books version changes "身" (shen, body) to "心" (xin, heart). The above text is because it is to rectify one's heart. In fact, it is also acceptable not to change it. The heart is inseparable from the body, and the body follows the orders of the heart.

The Way of Governing a Family is Difficult Due to Impartiality

The so-called "不得其正" (bu de qi zheng, not obtaining the correct way) is nothing more than being biased. The meaning of "正" (zheng, correct) is different. In the fourth paragraph, the meaning of the five "辟" (bi, avoidance) characters is the same. The concluding sentence of this paragraph uniquely argues that one cannot govern one's family if one does not cultivate oneself, showing that the difficulty of governing a family lies in the ease of being biased. The phrase "心誠求之" (xin cheng qiu zhi, seeking it with sincerity of heart) in the fifth paragraph is consistent with the phrase "誠意" (cheng yi, sincerity of intention) in the second paragraph. The two phrases "有諸己而后求諸人" (you zhu ji er hou qiu zhu ren, only after having it in oneself can one seek it in others) and "無諸己而后非諸人" (wu zhu ji er hou fei zhu ren, only after not having it in oneself can one criticize it in others) are the most precise meanings of the word "恕" (shu, forgiveness). We should pay attention to this. The "絜" (xie, measure) in "絜矩" (xie ju, measuring square) is defined by Zhu Xi as "度" (du, measurement). When measuring with a square, one should use physical objects as a standard. Up, down, front, back, left, and right, assuming it is a cube, every two sides must form a rectangle. Comparing the two rectangles is "絜矩" (xie ju, measuring square). "以能保我子孫、黎民尙亦有利哉、以不能保我子孫、黎民亦曰殆哉" (yi neng bao wo zi sun, li min shang yi you li zai, yi bu neng bao wo zi sun, li min yi yue dai zai, if it can protect my descendants, the common people will still benefit from it, if it cannot protect my descendants, the common people will also be in danger). "正義" (zheng yi, righteousness) (Notes on the Book of Rites) both have pauses after "子孫" (zi sun, descendants). The two "亦" (yi, also) characters in "尙亦有利" (shang yi you li, will still benefit) and "亦曰殆哉" (yi yue dai zai, will also be in danger) are relatively omitted. The Four Books version both have pauses after "黎民" (li min, common people), which is not as appropriate as "正義" (zheng yi, righteousness). "生財有大道" (sheng cai you da dao, there is a great way to generate wealth), is about the way of managing finances, which has not changed for thousands of years. "生之者衆" (sheng zhi zhe zhong, those who produce it are many) refers to farmers, "爲之者疾" (wei zhi zhe ji, those who make it are fast) refers to workers. The old saying refers to farmers, but the meaning is not complete. The concluding sentence of this paragraph, "不以利爲利以義爲利也" (bu yi li wei li yi yi wei li ye, do not take profit as profit, but take righteousness as profit), is thoroughly elaborated in Mencius's chapter on King Hui of Liang. "彼爲善之小人之使爲國家" (bi wei shan zhi xiao ren zhi shi wei guo jia, those petty men who pretend to be good are employed to govern the country) can also be read as a sentence. The ancient meaning of "爲" (wei, do) is similar to "僞" (wei, fake). "爲善之小人" (wei shan zhi xiao ren, petty men who pretend to be good) is like saying "僞善之小人" (wei shan zhi xiao ren, hypocritical petty men). Mr. Yang Zhongyi lectured on the essence of The Great Learning and The Doctrine of the Mean, saying that The Great Learning's "明德" (ming de, illuminating virtue) three sentences and The Doctrine of the Mean's "天命" (tian ming, mandate of heaven) three sentences, at the beginning, all reveal the three cardinal principles as the beginning of speaking of learning and teaching in an article. The Great Learning and The Doctrine of the Mean both speak of慎獨(shendu, being cautious when alone), both based on self-cultivation. The Great Learning prioritizes sincerity of intention, and The Doctrine of the Mean prioritizes ultimate sincerity. Therefore, The Great Learning and The Doctrine of the Mean complement each other. The Great Learning is for learning to be a person, and teaching is teaching people to become people. Learning from below can naturally reach above. The sages established their standards here. The Doctrine of the Mean is all about cultivating the Dao and teaching affairs. The Great Learning specifically speaks of the heart, and Zhu Xi specially adds the word "性" (xing, nature). The Doctrine of the Mean specifically speaks of nature, and Zhu Xi specially adds the word "心" (xin, heart). Heart and nature are not different, so The Great Learning and The Doctrine of the Mean reference and extend each other. Describing sages and ancestors is easy, and The Doctrine of the Mean corresponds. Speaking of timeliness is the same, heavenly virtue is the same, managing is the same, inaction is the same, learning and distinguishing actions is the same, The Doctrine of the Mean speaks of ordinary actions, making goodness become nature, the mandate of heaven is cultivating the Dao. One speaks of the principles of heaven, and the other speaks of human teaching. When heaven and earth are positioned, heaven and earth are in place. All things are funded at the beginning and grow, all things are nurtured. The Book of Changes begins with Qian and Kun in the upper classic, sincerity is the way of heaven, and the lower classic begins with Xian and Heng, sincerity is the way of man.

Buddhist Lecture on Karma, Distinguishing True from False

At the 39th session of the Rong Wu Scripture Society's Buddhist Lecture Series, 3rd term, Lay Buddhist Jiang Yiyuan lectured on the Pure Land School's theory of one mind and ten realms. The Flower Adornment Sutra's Jue Lin Bodhisattva's verse in the Yama Heaven Palace chapter says, "The mind is like an artisan, able to paint all worlds. The five aggregates all arise from it, there is nothing it does not create." Buddhism is the study of the mind. The mind is the root of karma. Although the events of karma are vastly different, they are produced by one unchanging true mind, following the four causes of good, evil, purity, and defilement, manifesting the ten realms of Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, Pratyekabuddhas, Sravakas, gods, humans, spirits, animals, hungry ghosts, and hells. All pure and impure lands in the ten directions are painted from the minds of sentient beings. Thoughts arise from actions, forming all worlds. The five aggregates arise from the four elements of form, suffering and joy from sensation, greed and anger from thought, actions from seeking, and discrimination and understanding from consciousness. This realm of form is created by one's own true mind and deluded consciousness. Being born as a human in this life is due to upholding the five precepts in the previous life. The verse says, "All Buddhas in the three times say that upholding the five precepts leads to rebirth as a human. The five precepts are the five constants: benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trustworthiness." Abstaining from killing is benevolence, abstaining from stealing is righteousness, abstaining from sexual misconduct is propriety, abstaining from lying is trustworthiness, and abstaining from drinking alcohol is wisdom. These five precepts are also the foundation for all precepts, from being born in heaven to becoming a Buddha. The pure like the four noble ones, and the impure like the five aggregates of the six paths, all arise from this limitless mind. The Heart Sutra says, "Illuminating the five aggregates as empty." Emptiness is another name for the true mind. The appearances of all things in the world are vastly different, all created by this true mind following conditions. Another verse says, "As the mind is, so is the Buddha. As the Buddha is, so are sentient beings. The mind, the Buddha, and sentient beings are three without difference." This is the same as Mencius's "Sages first understand what is the same in my heart" and "Yao and Shun were the same as ordinary people." That is, this mind is the same, this principle is the same. Another verse says, "If people want to understand all the Buddhas of the three times, they should contemplate the nature of the Dharma realm. Everything is created by the mind alone." All the sutras and teachings spoken by the Buddhas of the three times are spoken from this limitless true mind. This mind is shared by all Buddhas, so the principles spoken are also the same. The true mind, which neither arises nor ceases, is as limitless as space. What boundaries can it have? It can create the ten realms of the four noble ones and the six paths following the four causes. This mind is shared by the ten realms, the same in ancient and modern times. Confucius's easy to regulate benevolence, Laozi called it truth, called it nature, Mencius called it innate knowledge, called it the vast and righteous qi, all are different names for this mind. It was announced that the next National Language lecture will be held at 3:00 PM on the 15th at Xin Zhong, and the meeting adjourned.

### Shen Bao Reader's Scholarship Fund, Second Session Account Report, Total Expenditure of Over 51,000 Yuan for All Levels of Schools

The account report for the second session of the scholarship fund expenditures of this newspaper could have been published earlier. However, due to the fact that some of the applicants for the scholarship fund changed schools or for other reasons, they requested to change the check opening, and the newspaper had to accommodate the convenience of the students' eagerness to learn, and make changes at any time. Therefore, the original balances of each group have been changed a lot, and the bank transactions could not be closed for a while. I hope that the next applicants will pay close attention and consider carefully when applying. Once the check is signed, it should not be requested to be changed. If you are unable to enroll due to an accident, please return the check together, so that this newspaper can handle the closing procedures as soon as possible and avoid delays. I hope so. Now the upper (second) expenditure scholarship fund is settled to the end of March, a total of 7,633 yuan for the primary school group, 34,898.5 yuan for the middle school group, 5,206 yuan for the university group, and 3,850 yuan for the group. The payment is 51,587.5 yuan in total. As of the end of March, the balance is 36,934 yuan. From the 1st to the 10th of this month (April), the income is 2,650.5 yuan, and the total balance is 39,589.88 yuan.

### Trafficking in Return Home Permits, the Main Culprit Apprehended

Xie Dingguo from Ningbo, formerly a carpenter, intended to return home due to unemployment. On the 5th of this month, he purchased a special return home permit in the name of the headquarters of a special service organization from the Da Yun Travel Agency at No. 89 Fuzhou Road, Room 302, for five military tickets. The travel agency also had him change his name to Yang Amao. However, Xie Dingguo recently found business again and gave up the idea of returning home. Yesterday, Xie sold the permit to Zheng Agen on the Bund for three and a half military tickets. The incident was seen by the Chinese police, who suspected that he was buying and selling permits, and brought him to the police station together. After investigation by Chinese detective Mao Yunlong, it was found that according to the Shanghai Municipal Council's announcement, return home permits were entitled to a half-price discount, only requiring two and a half military tickets. Now, the permit is suspected of being forged. Therefore, Zhu Xipan, the Yong person in charge of the Da Yun Travel Agency (resident at No. 83 Guicheng Lane, Tiantong Road), was arrested, and many permits and epidemic prevention certificates were seized. According to Zhu's confession, the permits were purchased from Huang Shitang, the Yong person in charge of the Far East Company in Room 311, Guohua Building, No. 351 Beijing Road. Huang was subsequently arrested and brought to the Central Police Station together, and was detained pending investigation and resolution.

### Morphine Offender Arrested

Feng Xingen, a local, was found by the French police to have privately set up a morphine injection service for people at No. 6 Baoyu Lane, Caishi Street. The police dispatched detectives the day before yesterday and seized several packets of morphine and five morphine needles, along with the principal Feng Xingen, and detained them in the police station pending investigation.

### Notorious Thief Also Sells Counterfeit Money

The notorious thief Cui Xuewen from Jiangbei committed crimes in the Public Concession and hid at No. 15 Tongyi Lane, Roberts Road, evading the law. Recently, Huang Fusen, the Chinese detective chief of the Huishi Police Station, and detective Guo Xiangyao received a report of a clue and apprehended him on Roberts Road at noon on the 5th of this month. After interrogation, it was learned that he had stolen a coat worth more than 200 yuan and sold it to Chen Jifu, a fellow villager who worked as a garbage collector for the Shanghai Municipal Council at No. 4 Xinzha Road, for 10 yuan. Detective Guo went to Chen's address and arrested him, along with the original stolen coat, and found 22 handgun bullets in a wooden box under the bed. It was also found that Cui was selling counterfeit money and was working with Zhang Baotang from Shandong, who lived at No. 7 Gongyi Lane, Roberts Road, to harm the people. Zhang was also arrested, and 26 counterfeit 10-yuan banknotes of the Bank of Communications of China were seized. The date was changed. It was found that between April of the 29th year of the Republic of China and February of this year, Cui and his gang robbed the households of Weng Yongxin at No. 628 Xiaoshadu Road, Qu Junming at No. 166 Xinzha Road, Yu Boqing at No. 3 Xinzha Road, and Li Xianqing at No. 649 Tiantong Road, stealing property worth more than 8,000 yuan. They were sent to the court for interrogation and a clear confession was made. The verdict is scheduled to be announced on the 15th.

### Assisted to Enter University, Hoping to Cure Long-Standing Illness

Since its inception, your column has embodied the spirit of mutual assistance and has repeatedly resolved various difficult problems for readers free of charge. In particular, it has generously provided assistance to the general public, especially the sick. Recently, Mr. Ling Qi's brother was rescued with the help of your column, and it is truly a place for the poor and sick to turn to. Now, I would like to ask that when I was seven years old, I caught a cold and suffered from whooping cough. Because my mother believed in local remedies, she delayed treatment, which led to asthma. The symptoms gradually improved, but now it has been fourteen years. At first, it occurred several times a year, but then the number of times gradually increased. Now, it occurs almost every night and must rely on anesthetics to temporarily control it. The depth of the pain cannot be described. Now I have received the scholarship fund from your museum and have been admitted to the university to study. However, I am worried that with my chronic illness, I dare not look forward to the future. My family's financial situation is not well-off. In this world of extreme hardship, it is difficult to even fill my stomach. It is as difficult as ascending to heaven to raise money for medical expenses. In this desperate situation, I can only ask you to appeal to the public and show me the way. If I can get social assistance, the grace of rebirth will be boundless. Today I receive from society, and one day I will repay society. From Gan Sun, Gengqing Lane, Xinzha Road.

Service Column Note: Abundant knowledge and a healthy physique are necessary conditions for today's students. This column has repeatedly received appeals from all walks of life for medical relief events, which is truly compassionate. Limited by the cotton force, it is difficult to get an effective universal method, but only to do their best, to do the slightest service. Gan Sun's letter said that this column is aware that his education has reached the university, and the cost of family and social forces is not insignificant. If the long-standing illness is not cured, it will be a pity for society. It is used for publication, but does not accept reader donations. If a famous doctor can generously agree to examine, it will be notified. Yesterday, the newspaper's broadcast time was 6:40.

### Middle School Students, Bigamy, and Academic Atmosphere

—Yu Gong

Newspapers report that middle school students are extremely licentious and marry two women successively. This is shocking and can be used as a topic of conversation. In fact, what is heartbreaking for today's Shanghai society is more than this.

Wang Mingyang is only an 18-year-old young man who is still studying. What he seeks is not knowledge but female classmates. What he learns is not lessons but the dark side of the times. What is the use of such a student, such a young man to society? What is the use of his family, which possesses huge wealth? However, what caused his act of bigamy before he reached adulthood was still the burden of "possessing huge wealth."

Today's students in Shanghai, apart from those who study hard, are no less than Wang Mingyang or even worse. Wang Mingyang is just a representative of inferior students in Shanghai. This is what we feel about the serious failure of general education in Shanghai in the past 20 years. Such students and such atmosphere must not be tolerated in schools with strict discipline. However, where are the schools with such strict discipline in Shanghai? When it comes to collecting tuition fees, Wang Mingyang's family, which possesses huge wealth, will of course not fall behind and will never have the trouble of applying for scholarships. Many schools only ask for timely payment of tuition fees. The household registration is a first-class good student. How is the academic performance, is it included in the school's account? I don't know how many Wang Mingyangs are lurking in various schools, wearing Western suits and leather shoes, applying rouge and powder, drowsily attending classes during the day, and happily entering dance halls at night, reading dog, cattle, sheep, and doing beastly things.

We are not sorry for Wang Mingyang's fall, but we cannot help but grieve for the fallen academic atmosphere in Shanghai. I hope that those who are responsible for educating children will not regard this kind of atmosphere as a trivial matter. It is better to have no education than to educate them into beasts. It is better to teach and have no effect than to know and not teach.

Finally, Wang Mingyang's licentiousness and the academic atmosphere are worthy of concern. However, the family education that created his licentiousness and possessed huge wealth cannot escape the responsibility. Moreover, Wang Mingyang's father generously contributed to his private purse, knew about the bigamy, and repeatedly took on the important responsibility of being the officiant?

### White Hair Chapter

—Mo Chou

In the morning, while combing my hair, I accidentally dropped a white hair.

I was stunned. I almost didn't believe that this white hair had fallen from my own head. I looked in the mirror, and from the mirror, I saw that my head was still a black patch. However, a white hair would fall from this patch of black, young hair. As if I had suddenly lost something, I felt a nameless sense of melancholy and empty sorrow, and I stared blankly at this white hair.

People say that white hair is a sign of aging and a sign of leaving youth. What? Have I reached the age of aging? Have I lost my youth? No! No! I am not old! I am still young! I don't need white hair! I don't want it!

However, what lies in front of me is a white hair that no one can deny. Heaven! Many years of running around, busyness, many times of hardship, labor, and many years of struggling and fighting for survival, resulted in only one white hair!

This white hair, it! Consumed countless efforts over the past ten years, eroded my brain, and even almost drove away my youth and destroyed my courage to fight! I angrily picked up the scissors and cut the white hair in front of me into many small pieces as if in revenge. Then, I smiled as if I had won.

This asked, I was no longer sad. In the long years of more than ten years, countless precious efforts were wrung out. In terms of personnel, although I am still as clean as the wind and remain the same, and nothing has been left behind. But on the one hand, I have finally exchanged it for this white hair! These many blood and sweat are not in vain, with such achievements, why should I be sad? Moreover, it has not yet reached the time of "three thousand feet of white hair." Even if "scratching my white head makes it even shorter," but because this is also a little achievement and commemoration of the past, why bother "with not being able to hold it with a hairpin?"

I treasured the shattered white hair and waited for the second white hair to fall. I hope that after a certain period of time, in addition to not letting the years pass in vain and leaving a little achievement, I also hope to see white hair again, just as I hope to see a successful career on my journey in life!

### Where is the Art of Abstaining from Grains?

— Jian Long

I remember when I was little, I saw a method for abstaining from grains and becoming light in a book called "Family Treasure": at that time, in my simple and naive mind, I truly dreamed of becoming an immortal many times. Now, the delusion of ascending to heaven in broad daylight is gone, but the two words "abstaining from grains" are still buzzing and echoing in my ears, lingering! Is my addiction to being an immortal acting up again? Not so! It's just that in these times of rice being as precious as pearls and firewood as cinnamon—no, some say it's an era where a lump of coal is worth an egg! I just want to save a few bowls of rice. Unfortunately, my "Family Treasure" has long turned into ashes with the war and cannot "pass down the family", so there is no way to talk about the secret to saving rice... Some people think that Chinese thought is superstitious and unscientific: okay, now let me tell you what the foreign devils are saying. The famous French chemist Marcellin Berthelot, who is known as the "King of Chemistry", used the topic "The World in the Year 2000 AD" at a banquet of a chemical product association on April 5, 1894, and purely from the standpoint and perspective of chemistry, expressed his imagination of how people at that time would solve the food problem, saying: "...At that time, there will be no agriculture, no shepherds, and no farmers in the world; the problem of living by cultivating the land will be eliminated by chemistry... (The following talks about mining, not using geothermal heat)... On the day when the ability to obtain economically is achieved, people will not hesitate to use carbon borrowed from carbonic acid, hydrogen extracted from water, and nitrogen and oxygen provided by the atmosphere to artificially manufacture food...

One day will come when, to nourish themselves, everyone will carry a small cake of nitrogen, a small strip of fat, a small piece of starch or sugar, and a small bottle of spices that match their taste. All of this will be produced economically and endlessly in our factories; all of this will be completely unaffected by the uncertain seasons, rain or drought, fires, and frost that destroys the hope of fruitfulness; and finally, all of this will be completely isolated from the pathogenic microorganisms—the source of plagues and the enemy of human life...

On that day... there will be no fields full of crops, no vineyards, and no pastures full of livestock... Assuming the surface of the earth stops being used as it is today... then it will be covered with green grass, forests, and flowers: the earth will become a vast garden... where people live in the abundance and happiness of the mythical golden age..."

It's just that the year 2000 AD is still in the vast and ethereal future! Even if this delusional art of abstaining from grains can be realized by then, even if it is realized, isn't that like seeking me in a dried fish shop? Even if it is realized and I am fortunate enough to live to that time, wouldn't these nitrogen cakes, fat strips, etc., which are said to be "produced economically and endlessly," still be hoarded and monopolized, and the price raised desperately, so that we ordinary people would not dare to inquire about them? Now, the very common quinine and aspirin are an excellent example. Heavens! Where is the art of abstaining from grains?...

### Self-Confidence

— Liu Jia Gan

If there were no "self-confidence," bicycles might not have appeared in the world; if there were no "self-confidence," the various research works in science would not have the satisfactory results they have now!

"Self-confidence" is not empty exaggeration, nor is it pedantic stubbornness; it has truth as its background—Jesus' death may have been because he believed in the truth he had comprehended.

Self-confidence is a kind of power, it encourages people to work; and only self-confidence can give people the opportunity to succeed!

Don't hesitate, be confused, or depressed any longer, go close to the world to increase your experience—that way you will gain self-confidence, a power that gives you new life, only "self-confidence" can save you!

### Chemical Utilization of Food

— Chen Cui Cui

If you patronize a restaurant in Berlin, a regular meal placed in front of customers in the restaurant includes scrambled eggs, white sausage, fish, filled steamed buns, and coffee.

Germany is doing its best to encourage raising domestic chickens and hold laying competitions. The champion is the one who lays three hundred eggs in three hundred and sixty hours. Anyone who lays more than one hundred and forty eggs a year will be commended. Germans also mix soy milk, soda, batter, and milk dregs, add yellow coloring, and use skillful cooking techniques to make eggs, so that you can't see any flaws at all.

White sausage is made by grinding breadcrumbs, sawdust, and flaxseed cakes into fine powder. The bones and entrails of the fish can be used to feed chickens or as filling for steamed buns. And the cheese in the filling is a new chemical product. Seventy percent is animal glue, twenty percent is butter, and eight percent is yam extract. Adding a little artificial vinegar, the taste is quite delicious. Coffee is made from roasted wheat kernels.

In addition, there are even more novel substitutes; such as milk made from ash, small shrimp raised with ammonia water, meat transformed by soaking lamb legs in red wine for two days, lead sulfate mustard, butter made from coal, containing sixty-four percent water, seventeen percent mineral oil, seventeen percent batter, and three percent salt. In flour, mix twenty percent sawdust, gypsum powder, and a mixture of sand from Bovey. Their toothpaste uses high-quality cigar ash. Their spirit of being able to use chemistry to improve food is indeed worthy of attention.

### Cutting Hair and Selling Hair

— Bi Geng

What is the use of the hair cut off in barbershops? Now, in the United States, some of it is sent to factories to manufacture rare amino acids. This compound is a previously unknown link between inanimate and living matter. After washing the waste hair and treating it with hydrochloric acid, the valuable raw material is filtered out, then the acid is extracted, purified, and finally bottled for experiments. The price is US$1,000 per pound.

### Sharing the Same Boat in Wind and Rain

— He Jia Zhi

(3) Guest Arrives

Huang Long moved a lamp with a glass shade to find the place on the wall where the sound had just come from, and said, "That's it, that's it, do you see? There's a crack here, it's a new crack. Brother Wei Cheng, don't be afraid, once I slept in an ancient tomb, using the coffin lid as a bed." He then spoke freely, showing Wei Cheng his arm, saying that he had been cut with a knife. He spoke happily, forgetting that he was in a house of mourning, he only regarded speaking as the price of drinking. Wei Cheng fell asleep again, and he was still talking. It wasn't until the magpie went to report to Second Madam Ye, who was afraid that Wei Cheng would catch a cold, and forced him to go back to his room, that Huang Long stopped drinking.

Huang Long and Wei Cheng slept in the same room. The next day, Wei Cheng woke up and didn't see Huang Long. He pricked up his ears and listened, hearing a faint sound of crying, which included the crying of Second Madam Ye, the crying of Cui Zhen, and the crying of the servant. He unconsciously shed tears, wetting a large area of the pillow. The magpie, serving outside the room, heard Wei Cheng sob, walked in and said, "Young Master, are you awake? Second Madam instructed that when the young master wakes up, please wash his face and hands first, go to the Madam's spirit, offer incense, and kowtow." Wei Cheng wiped his tearful eyes and asked, "Where is the young master Huang who slept in this room?" The magpie said, "He left at dawn, he didn't say anything, I opened the door." Wei Cheng was originally sleeping in his clothes, but as soon as he sat up, he got out of bed. The magpie quickly took a gray cloth cotton robe from the hanger and gave it to Wei Cheng to wear. As Wei Cheng put on his clothes, he glanced at the table against the wall, seeing a piece of white paper on the table, with a few words written in thick eyebrows and big eyes. When he looked, it was, "Brother Wei Cheng: Today is New Year's Eve, I'll go collect gambling debts and come back, if I don't come, I'll definitely come in the new year. Cry less. Huang Long left the message." (48)
