### Bataan Peninsula Defense Line Breached: U.S.-Philippine Forces in General Retreat, Now Defending at Fort Mills; Japanese Offensive Extremely Fierce

Washington, 9th (Havas): The War Department has announced that the defense of the Bataan Peninsula by U.S.-Philippine forces has ended.

Washington, 9th (Havas): It was announced here today that General Yamashita's crack troops, under the Japanese commander in the Philippines, launched a fierce attack on the U.S.-Philippine forces' positions on the Bataan Peninsula. After four nights of intense fighting, accompanied by incessant bombardment from aircraft and artillery, they broke through the defenders' lines three days ago. Although the defenders claimed to have retreated to new positions yesterday, the location of these new positions was not specified. It was only this morning that General Wainwright, commander of the U.S.-Philippine forces in the Philippines, reported from Fort Mills on Corregidor Island that the defense of the Bataan Peninsula had ended.

Washington, 9th (Reuters): It is widely believed that the resistance of U.S.-Philippine troops on the Bataan Peninsula (Luzon Island) against the Japanese has ended. After the military launched a new attack on the American lines, U.S. Commander in the Philippines General Wainwright urgently telegraphed Washington, stating that the U.S. forces were exhausted and their counterattack had failed. The Japanese forces had already encircled the eastern side of the defenders. The War Department's public announcement stated that detailed reports of the battle had not yet been received, but based on the situation, the defenses of the Bataan Peninsula may have been breached. General Wainwright's telegram came from Fort Mills, but the number of defenders who retreated to this stronghold is currently unknown.

Washington, 9th (Reuters): The War Department announced at 6:00 PM yesterday that fresh Japanese troops in the Philippines continue to launch major attacks on the new positions of the U.S.-Philippine forces on the Bataan Peninsula, with bombers and fighter planes incessantly attacking our front lines and rear. The intensity of this offensive is unprecedented since the beginning of the Bataan Peninsula campaign. Elite troops are relentlessly attacking, wave after wave, with no end in sight. The U.S.-Philippine forces and Marines are putting up a very strong resistance. The fortress on Corregidor Island in Manila Bay has not been subjected to air raids in the past 24 hours.

Washington, 8th (Havas): The War Department has issued a battle report stating that the U.S.-Philippine forces on the Bataan Peninsula have executed a general retreat and moved to new positions to continue fighting. The Japanese forces are constantly gathering fresh troops as reinforcements and are pushing forward with all their might. The Japanese are currently launching a fierce attack on our new positions, covered by dive bombers.

Washington, 8th (Havas): The War Department acknowledges that after the U.S. forces on the Bataan Peninsula retreated to new positions, it is generally believed here that the defending troops are in a very difficult situation. It is reported that the retreat was carried out at night, with the hope of a temporary truce to allow sufficient time to set up new defensive lines. However, this is inconsistent with the War Department's announcement this afternoon that the U.S. forces there are under intense Japanese attack. The general impression here is that the Japanese have decided to end American resistance in northern Manila. Since the 5th of this month, the War Department has issued six battle reports, each acknowledging new Japanese advances. The Japanese are concentrating all their efforts on advancing towards the center of the American defense. The War Department also acknowledged today that American losses have been heavy, with a significant imbalance of forces.

### Former Egyptian Army Chief Maher Arrested; Egyptian Army to Increase to One Million

Cairo, 8th (Havas): An official announcement stated that Maher, former Minister of War and Chief of Staff of the Army, who had been in hiding for several months, was finally arrested today.

Ankara, 9th (Agence Anatolia): According to Cairo news, Prime Minister Nahas, during an inspection of bombed cities, said that the Egyptian army would soon increase to one million men. The defeat in the Far East proves that all countries must prepare for self-defense and cannot rely on the assistance of other countries.

Sacrifice is necessary for the future of Egypt.

### United China Relief in America to Establish Office in Chongqing, Strengthening Liaison with New York Headquarters, Studying Constructive Relief Plans

Chongqing, 9th: It is reported that the United China Relief in America has sent a telegram instructing the establishment of an office in Chongqing. Liang Xiaochu, General Secretary of the National Association of Chinese YMCAs, has appointed Aide Shu, a staff member of the association, as the director of the Chongqing office after receiving the telegram. The task of the office is to strengthen the liaison between China and the New York headquarters, collect various materials in China, study relief methods, and pay particular attention to constructive plans to plan for the aftermath of the war zones. It will submit opinions on various plans and apportionment methods to the headquarters. The office is advisory in nature and not an executive agency. According to the plan of the United China Relief in America, it intends to assist in the following areas: medicine, hygiene, education (including relief for students and faculty), childcare, economic construction, social reform, and direct relief. The office plans to hire Chinese and American celebrities and experts to form an advisory committee to study the above issues and assist the office in implementing various plans. It is reported that Knot, Director of the Research Department of the Pacific Relations Society, will serve as the headquarters' liaison officer in China and will soon arrive in Chongqing.

### Five Seats in British House of Commons to Be By-Elected

Bern, 8th (Havas): A correspondent for the Neue Zürcher Zeitung in London reports that by-elections will be held for five seats in the British House of Commons in the near future. London political circles are very concerned about this, and the Conservative Party is quite fearful that the party will suffer a defeat in the upcoming election. Previously, in the by-election held in the Gronsim district, the ultra-factional candidate Dundas was unexpectedly elected, which is one example. It is generally believed that Dundas's success was due to his support for radical proposals and his presentation of strong plans for social reform and opposition to private interests. In the future, any candidate who vigorously advocates resolute policies and opposes class interests can gain popular support. Only Conservative Party organs such as "The Daily Telegraph" and "The Sunday Times" are warning readers that the policies advocated by ultra-factional candidates can only hinder the difficult work currently being carried out by the government and must be opposed. The British public's support for the New Deal today can be seen in the fact that Sir Auckland's recent launch of the "Forward Movement" has gained widespread support. This movement advocates the practical and sincere application of democratic principles in the political, economic, and life spheres. Its main points are as follows: 1. Implement a controlled economy. 2. Eliminate all privileges. 3. All citizens of the country should have genuine judicial equality. 4. Promote international cooperation. 5. Recognize that every country has the right to freely obtain raw materials and industrial goods. This movement is similar in meaning to the "New England Movement" created by the Archbishop of Canterbury and Sir Cripps. The various public demonstrations initiated by the "Forward Movement" have gained national sympathy.

The French ambassador will also submit a written protest in the future, to which the U.S. State Department will respond. At the end of today's meeting, Welles took the opportunity to inform the French ambassador that the U.S. government has instructed the American Red Cross to send a ship carrying milk and food to the free zone of France to distribute to children in need.

### Marshall and Hopkins Arrive in London Together, Carrying Roosevelt's Confidential Mission; Naval Strategy is the Focus of Talks

London, 8th (Havas): U.S. Army Chief of Staff General Marshall and Lend-Lease Administrator Hopkins arrived here together today with several secretaries. It is reported that their trip was by bomber. General Marshall's main task is to consult with British Army Chief of Staff Sir Brooke on important matters. It is said that naval strategy issues will be the focus of the talks. However, according to Washington news, White House Secretary O'Reilly told the press that Marshall's trip was only intended to maintain normal contact with Allied authorities during wartime and had no special purpose.

London, 8th (Associated Press): The joint flight of Marshall and Hopkins to England to hold an emergency meeting with Prime Minister Churchill has given the general public a deep impression that the Allies are preparing to strike Germany. Marshall said that President Roosevelt gave him a highly confidential mission, adding, "We will have new developments in Europe." Hopkins, after describing the speed of the transport of military supplies to the Soviet Union, said, "The United States is sending large amounts of military supplies to any theater where Germany can be defeated."

Stockholm, 9th (Agence Anatolia): According to London news, U.S. Army Chief of Staff General Marshall, who arrived in London yesterday with Hopkins, chairman of the Allied Military Supply Committee, will soon meet with the new British Army Chief of Staff Brooke. Those who came with Marshall include Colonel Craig, Lieutenant Colonel Weimeiya, and Lieutenant Fulton of the U.S. Navy.

### U.S. Decides to Aid Allied Forces in India

Washington, 8th (Associated Press): According to authoritative sources, the United States has established a non-military agency responsible for providing Lend-Lease assistance to the United Nations forces in India. Previously, the Lend-Lease plan for India was handled entirely by the War Department and the State Department in close consultation. Now, with the increasing importance of the Indian theater, it is widely believed that the authorities need to establish a highly specialized management agency. At the same time, the United States hopes to show India that the United States is giving full consideration to India's defense issues. It is widely believed that all of this is the reason why the United States established a non-military management agency to plan for defense needs and discuss the distribution of military supplies with India. Some believe that Currie may be appointed to coordinate aid to India.

### Canadian Embassy to the United States to Be Rapidly Upgraded

Ottawa, 9th (Reuters): It is widely rumored here that the Canadian Legation in Washington will soon be upgraded to an embassy, ​​and a Canadian cabinet member will serve as ambassador.

### Eastern Front Situation

German Headquarters, 9th (Agence Anatolia): This afternoon's German war report stated that Soviet troops attacking German positions in the central and northern sectors of the Eastern Front were all repulsed.

German fighter groups bombed port facilities and oil refineries along the Caucasian coast day and night.

Schiff, 9th (Reuters): It is reported here that Soviet forces in the central sector have broken through German defenses. The Soviet forces in all of Belarus are continuing to advance, so the war has not stopped. Belarus's border is 45 miles west of Smolensk and about 20 miles west of Roslavl.

### Japanese Envoy to Vatican to Depart for Rome Next Week

### U.S. Coast Exercises Blackout

New York, 8th (Havas): The various ports on the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of the United States are currently practicing blackouts. According to the opinions of general aviation experts, the United States is likely to be subjected to air raids. On the Pacific side, the American coast is very far from Japanese bases, so air raids can only be carried out by aircraft carriers. Although air raids are easier on the Atlantic side than on the Pacific side, they would only be on a small scale, as there are currently no aircraft that can carry large numbers of bombs back and forth across the Atlantic. Therefore, the real crisis for the United States is if the Axis powers occupy Iceland and the Azores, they will attempt to bomb the densely populated military-industrial areas of the United States.

### Resolutions of India's Two Major Parties to Be Announced Tomorrow and the Day After; Nehru Met with Johnson Yesterday

New Delhi, 9th (Reuters): The Standing Committee of the National Congress Party adjourned at 4:30 PM today and is scheduled to resume its meeting at 8:30 AM tomorrow morning. Congress Party Chairman Acharya and Nehru met with Sir Cripps at 5:30 PM this afternoon.

It is reported that the National Congress Party's communiqué regarding the British War Cabinet's final proposal will be announced tomorrow or Saturday, and the Muslim League's resolution is expected to be announced at the same time.

New Delhi, 9th (Reuters): Sir Cripps's original reception for journalists at 10:15 AM today has been postponed indefinitely. The opportunity for a solution to the Indian problem has become clearer. However, officials say that some time is still needed to reach a final resolution with the National Congress Party and the All-India Muslim League. Today, former Congress Party Chairman Nehru first met with Colonel Johnson, personal representative of President Roosevelt, at the latter's headquarters for more than an hour. Johnson then visited Cripps for ten minutes. The Standing Committee of the Congress Party also met today and adjourned at 10:30 AM, scheduled to resume its meeting at 2:30 PM this afternoon.

New Delhi, 9th (Reuters): Cripps, who was originally scheduled to meet with reporters and make a statement at 10:15 this morning, has now postponed the meeting, and the time is not yet set. The general situation is brighter than before, but according to officials, the resolution of the issues after the meetings between the authorities and the National Congress and the Muslim League must wait several days before it can be decided. It is generally believed that the developments in the British-Indian negotiations have been notified to Gandhi.

New Delhi, 9th (Reuters): When the President of the All-India Muslim League, Jinnah, met with the British Envoy Cripps last night, it is said that Cripps presented him with a new plan. Jinnah then submitted this new plan to the Standing Committee of the Muslim League for discussion. Previously, the Committee had passed a resolution stating that the British proposal failed to meet the wishes of Indian Muslims and was difficult to agree with.

New Delhi, 9th (Reuters): Nehru agreed with the US presidential representative Johnson today for an hour. After the meeting, about 10 minutes of talks were held with Cripps.

The shipowner immediately telegraphed the Ningbo branch by wireless, and a small vessel was sent to transfer all the approximately 600 passengers to the north bank of the Ningbo River. Although the cargo in the hold was also transferred to the small vessel, some of it had been damaged by water, and the loss has not yet been estimated.

### China Central Telegraph and Telephone Revises Prices

China Central Permanent Gas Communication Company has completely revised the prices for telegrams and telephone calls, which will be implemented starting April 11th. The revised telegram rates per word are as follows:

| Category | Japanese | Chinese | Foreign Language |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Central China** |  |  |  |
| Government Telegram | 10 cents | 20 cents |  |
| Private Telegram | 15 | 25 | Alternating |
| News Telegram | 6 | 10 |  |
| **North China** |  |  |  |
| Government Telegram | 15 | 25 |  |
| Private Telegram | 20 | 30 | Sent to Guangdong, Xiamen |
| News Telegram | 6 | 10 |  |
| **Changchun** |  |  |  |
| Government Telegram | 20 | 30 | Sent to Mengjiang, Japan |
| Private Telegram | 30 | 40 |  |
| News Telegram | 8 | 3 | |

Among the price rates for telephone calls, the rates for local calls have always varied. This time, the differential will be based on the number of users and set separately by region. For example, for Nanjing, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Wuxi, etc., the residential rate is 8 yuan, and the business rate is 10 yuan. For Wuhu, Bengbu, Changshu, etc., the residential rate is 7 yuan, and the business rate is 8 yuan. These graded rates are set to reflect the effectiveness of the telephones. As for Shanghai, the residential rate is 13 yuan, and the business rate is 20 yuan.

Long-distance telephone rates will increase by 60% to 80% depending on the location. For example, the rate between Shanghai and Nanjing, which was previously 1 yuan, will be changed to 1.80 yuan. The rate between Shanghai and Suzhou, which was previously 40 cents, will be changed to 70 cents. The rates for calls to Beijing, Tianjin, and other places will increase by about 30%. In addition, the rates for non-stop calls to places like Japan will be changed from 7.50 yuan for three minutes to 9.90 yuan.

### Chinese Drug Exhibition

Shen Nong tasted hundreds of herbs and was the first inventor of Chinese medicine. In these five thousand years, the evolution of Chinese medicine history and the advancement of Chinese medicine cannot be investigated. Chinese doctors are also stuck in their ways, moving a little bit of fur from the "Tangtou Gejue" and discriminating against Western washing, or simply boasting about Hua Tuo and Bian Que. In fact, Western medicine emphasizes practicality and is easy to win the trust of patients. Chinese medicine has such a long history, and naturally it has its indelible merits. Dr. Wu Yunrui, professor of physiology at the Aurora University School of Medicine, broke the feudal discriminatory psychology and engaged in the study of the history of Chinese medicine. Now, together with botanist Dr. Wang Xingyi (Jocque Roi, Frenchman) and pastor, he will hold this Chinese medicine exhibition with the research collection.

The contents of the exhibition are divided into: Chinese Taoist alchemy medicines (instruments and mineral medicines), Chinese precious fine drug specimens, Chinese medicinal plants, Chinese medicinal animals, literature and specimens of gastrointestinal diseases, various books and cultural relics related to medicine, Chinese successive transcripts of herbal books, Chinese Pharmacopoeia, Folk talks, Compendium of Materia Medica, and ancient foreign literature. Vertically speaking, it is a history of Chinese medicine: horizontally, it has the value of mutual research between medicine and medical theory.

Such a vast exhibition cannot be finished by just taking a quick glance. The reporter's inspection of a few minutes of work during their arrangement naturally cannot be explained clearly, and this is profound knowledge that laymen cannot understand at a glance; however, as an appreciation, there is endless interest.

In my memory, I can give a brief description separately.

Taoist alchemy medicines are various minerals. Emperor Qin Shihuang searched for the elixir of immortality, which was probably the kind of thing that looked like a Ming dynasty stone, which was the earliest mineral medicine.

The story of the White Snake stealing "fairy grass" is a well-known folk story, and there are various kinds of herbs on display.

Among the medicinal animals, there is a kind of "summer grass winter worm," which looks like a pupa.

There is a "Taoist Medicine Gong Tu", which depicts Taoist exercises, such as "Zhang Zhen Slave Concentrates and Looks," which has the effect of "curing heart disease." Lu Zu, the medicine hides the Bodhisattva, and medicine cures the Buddha. There are carved idols.

Other things such as pills, powders, creams, and elixirs sold in medicinal material shops, as well as medicinal utensils, are divided into categories and have detailed collections.

Most noteworthy is a picture of parasites. It tells us the harm of parasites and the reasons for the transmission of all parasites. This seems to be the same as the one displayed in the health room of the Confucian Temple Park before the war. There are six types of parasites in total: (1) roundworm, (2) uncinate tapeworm, (3) liver fluke, (4) schistosome, (5) Japanese blood fluke, (6) Yokokawa fluke. As the saying goes, "Disease enters through the mouth, and disaster comes out of the mouth." These parasites enter the human body, which is indeed caused by careless diet. Shanghai people have a good appetite, which is worthy of attention.

Most of the Chinese herbal books transcribed from past dynasties were donated by Mr. Fan Xingzhun. Fan is an expert in collecting and studying medical books, but he does not practice medicine. According to himself, "Doctors are busy seeing patients and have no time to study books." This is the truth, but now there are still "seven generations of Confucian doctors" as the "qualification" of doctors, which is laughable.

The exhibition will begin on the twelfth of this month, and the specimen room and ancient storage room of the Aurora Museum will also be open at the same time.

The Aurora Museum Specimen Room is the museum with the most collected antlers in the world. When you enter the gate, the walls are decorated with antler specimens. The collection of birds is also very rich. There is a bird (the name has been forgotten) that only the Paris Museum has a similar one, which shows the richness of the collection.

In the ancient storage room, from the Zhou Yi Shang Ding, sacrificial bells and cups, to the micro snuff bottles, it is true that "everything ancient is available, and nothing ancient is not collected."

Although this exhibition is a niche exhibition, whether for research or appreciation, you may wish to wander there for an hour.

### Cake and Steamed Bread Guild Submits a Request to Severely Punish Those Who Illegally Apply for Flour

The Cake and Steamed Bread Trade Association at 2 Lane 202 Guangxi Road in this city was established with the permission of the Shanghai Municipal Council and the competent authorities. When the Shanghai Municipal Council first handled the low-priced flour at 10.03 yuan, the association distributed it to its members for use. They have spared no effort in providing medical treatment and medicine, relieving poverty and disease, evacuating fellow villagers returning to their hometowns, and distributing low-priced flour. Recently, due to the so-called "Cake, Noodle, and Fried Dough Stick Guild embezzling and selling low-priced flour, "the association, in addition to submitting a request to the authorities for severe punishment, also sent personnel to investigate the facts and hope that the deceived cake and steamed bread shops will report to the association. The Cake and Steamed Bread Guild wrote: "Dear Sirs, we recently read a news item in the ninth issue of your newspaper about the chairman of the Cake and Steamed Bread Guild illegally obtaining flour and being arrested by the police. After reading it, we were extremely surprised. It was found that the aforementioned incident occurred in a Cake, Noodle, and Fried Dough Stick Guild that had not been approved by the competent authorities. It has nothing to do with our association. The title of your newspaper mistakenly used the name of the Cake and Steamed Bread Guild, which has greatly damaged the reputation of our association. We hereby send a special letter to clarify the facts and distinguish between right and wrong. Sincerely hope that you will give a correction to clarify the truth. Sincerely, The Shanghai Cake and Steamed Bread Trade Association, April 9th."

### Raw Silk Steady with a Hint of Weakness

Yesterday, the dark market for raw silk was steady but continued to show a slight weakness. The Tianjin gang and the silver building industry supplied and sold one after another, and the price was suppressed. In the morning, each strip (ten taels) initially traded at 18,800 yuan, slightly higher by 100 yuan. A certain gold shop and silver shop gang had difficulty accepting it. Under the selling pressure of the North gang and the silver building industry, the price fell by 300 yuan to 18,500 yuan. After 11:15, there were no more transactions, and the market price was also flat, 200 yuan lower than the previous day. Transactions were scarce.

The selling price of gold ornaments in silver buildings was 1,950 yuan per tael (200 yuan less for incoming purchases), and silver was still suspended at 18 yuan, the black market was 13 yuan, and silver dollars were 7.5 yuan, but there was a market with no transactions.

### US Dollars Continue to Rise

Yesterday, the foreign currency market saw British and American gold pounds remain at their original levels, with the former at 420 yuan and the latter at 430 yuan. US dollar notes continued to rise to 32-33 yuan. Hong Kong notes rose slightly to 3.6 yuan, with large notes being 10 cents lower. Military notes opened at the highest price of 7.65 yuan in the morning, and then gradually retreated to 4.4 cents, with the final price being 7.51 yuan.

### All Banks and Firms Must Report Daily Legal Tender Receipts and Payments

The Temporary Federation of Silver Buildings in this city, in order to clarify the daily receipts and payments of old legal tender by all banks and firms, yesterday sent letters to all banks and firms, notifying them to fill out and submit a daily report of receipts and payments of old legal tender from today onwards. The form includes columns for denomination, original balance, receipts, payments, and remaining balance.

Each person can exchange up to 300 yuan in legal tender for Central Reserve notes every day, but it is still difficult to exchange for legitimate needs. It is heard that starting today, a total of 20 banks, including Jin Cheng and Da Lu, will be responsible for the exchange. Each person can hold 300 yuan in Central China and Communications Bank currency to exchange for 231 yuan in Central Reserve notes. However, it is heard that there are still considerable restrictions on the number of exchanges and the total amount of exchanges per day.

### Public Bonds Cannot Withstand Selling Pressure

The public bond market suddenly experienced a decline yesterday. Da Kangcheng suddenly sold hundreds of thousands on behalf of a certain financial industry, and all gangs became nervous and followed the trend. The decline was very rapid. Category E suddenly broke through the 60 yuan mark, and the market suddenly became lively. Although the selling pressure was very strong, the buyers were also quite active. In fact, it was a bank loan problem. The market price is feared to have another small side. It was found that Da Kangcheng sold as soon as it opened, and when Category C fell to 2 yuan, it once bought back a small number for fear of a straight-line decline, but the downward trend was obvious, and the small price once fell by another yuan. Although Tong Kang and Yi Tai made up for some of the losses, they were cheap under the high pressure of the sellers, so most of them were at a breakeven price. Category E broke through the 60 yuan mark, which was announced to be broken. The other gangs, Da Zhong, Jiu Feng, Yi Chang, Run De, and Lian Yi, all sold. Zhen Hua, Hong Da, Fu Hua, and Xin Hua either sold or bought. On the buying side, there were Gong Mao, De Chang, Bao Long, Tong Li, Lian Xing, Hong Xing, and general retail investors, who absorbed at low prices. As a result, the prices all fell uniformly by 1.20 yuan to 1.75 yuan. The total number of transactions was approximately 1.7 million yuan. The following is a brief table:

| Category | Highest | Lowest | Closing | Compared to Previous Day |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Unified A | 68.60 | 67.00 | 67.40 | Down 1.60 |
| Unified B | 63.80 | 62.10 | 62.20 | Down 1.65 |
| Unified C | 62.90 | 61.00 | 61.10 | Down 1.75 |
| Unified D | 58.40 | 57.20 | 57.20 | Down 1.20 |
| Unified E | 61.40 | 59.80 | 59.80 | Down 1.50 |

### Buying Cigarettes Will Soon Undergo Some Changes

The cigarette market is dominated by the products of the British-American Tobacco Company (i.e., the products of the Yi Zhong Tobacco Factory), which are distributed by Yong Tai He, which is handled by Chinese people. Since the outbreak of the Cambodia-Asia War, there has been an invisible stagnation. At one time, Yong Tai Hang was still responsible for it, but it stopped shortly after distribution. At present, it is still handled by the original route and renamed Maru San Commercial and Industrial Company. It is still distributed to the local industry for sales. The number of packs that can be retailed per person is limited, and the prices are calculated in Japanese military currency, and no additional sales are allowed. The words "Retail by Yong Tai He Designated Industry" are hung at the door, so the public can buy them. The rest are not bound, so most are still sold according to the market. At present, the number of colleagues selling low-priced cigarettes is very small, and the customers are 50% cheaper than other stores, so the stores selling them are quite crowded. It is heard that sales are limited to certain times and people must queue up. In the future, general sales may eliminate this situation.

### ]The Skilled Wife's Difficulty in Cooking Without Coal

— Zhou Mo

A news report carried the headline "Request for Chemical Testing of Coal Briquette Raw Materials," stating that coal merchants claimed that the raw materials now used to make briquettes are mostly willow river chippings and other scraps that were previously not used. The yellow coal pieces in the briquettes are coal that has already been burned. Only by constructing them in this way can profits be made, they said. After reading this news, one almost finds it a strange tale, leaving one not knowing whether to laugh or cry.

The poor quality of coal briquettes is truly at its worst now. After returning from husking rice, even when carefully tending to a coal briquette stove, it still burns dimly. Every household is sighing at the sight of coal briquettes. To live in such a time is truly a marvel!

It is true that coal briquette merchants face difficulties in sourcing materials, and they should not be harshly criticized. However, asking customers to "reignite dead ashes" is a kind of scientific examination. Even a three-year-old child would not believe that there is any hope of reignition. Furthermore, coal briquette merchants are so confident, asking customers to do the impossible. No wonder poor families, wanting to cook a pot of mushy rice, end up with rice that is hard as a rock.

In business today, it is impossible not to make money, rare to make little money, and only right to make a lot of money. But the customer is always the one to suffer. To get fuel, they end up spending money to buy difficult-to-burn coal briquettes, and sometimes they still cannot be lit. In this situation, coal briquette merchants, amidst their extreme difficulties, should try to find ways to improve. Moreover, how much of the coal briquette is actually burned coal pieces? Only the briquette maker knows. Coal briquette users have never known that burned coal pieces can be used to make briquettes. Otherwise, someone would have had a far-fetched idea long ago, hoarding coal ash, and even garbage cans would be spotless!

It is difficult to buy coal briquettes, and even more difficult to get the coal briquettes to burn after buying them. When will my words make readers think it's a joke? Only then will we be spared the pain of "the skilled wife's difficulty in cooking without coal."

### The Art of Conversation

— R Yang

When meeting someone you know well, one cannot avoid exchanging a few pleasantries at the beginning, as a kind of "introduction." However, speaking is not very convenient these days. Even those everyday, seemingly light pleasantries must be "carefully considered before speaking." It is said that conversation is an art. Carnegie wrote many articles in his book "How to Win Friends and Influence People." This art is now indeed becoming important and requires study.

For example, saying, "You must be doing very well these days?" If you casually prepare to use this sentence to start a conversation, you might not expect it to have an "unexpected effect," making the other party feel very embarrassed and unable to answer. His situation is constantly deteriorating. Sometimes it might stir up a vortex of worry and sorrow in his temporarily calm mood!

Especially a common phrase like "Have you eaten?" it is best not to blurt it out at this time and place. If your conversational partner is not a familiar friend, your words will pierce his heart like a sharp knife. He may be eating corn flour, nibbling on some pancakes, or eating sorghum, who knows? The word "eat" will make him angry, or even suspect that you are deliberately teasing him.

Therefore, this type of polite greeting is difficult to use for social conversation. If you really have to say something, the most appropriate thing is probably "The weather today is..." However, it is said that there is also a strange connection between the weather and people's temperament...

### Sharing the Same Boat Through Storms

— He Jia Zhi

(3) A Guest Arrives

Wei Cheng explained it to him again, and Huang Long said: "I don't like to do things that way, even if many of them are lies from the ancients. I think it's difficult to do, so I just cry for a while. I don't need anyone to comfort me, and I don't want anyone to know that I'm crying. Brother Wei Cheng, do you know what I've been doing lately?" Wei Cheng said, "I was just about to ask you." Huang Long said, "Damn it! Everyone in Huagang looks down on me, so I opened a small teahouse in Guanyintang to have some fun. It's been over a year now."

Wei Cheng nodded, not saying whether this business was good or bad. Huang Long said, "It's been really lively this year. Once, I was gambling with some friends; the police station suddenly sent brothers to catch us gambling. I blew out the light with a 'pop' sound. Brother Wei Cheng, don't think I'm afraid of the police. What's so scary about the police? Anyone can be a policeman with a stick and a gun. What I'm afraid of is my friends being afraid when they see the police. I blew out the light, and some opened the window and jumped out, some crawled out from under my crotch. After a commotion, damn it, they turned on their electric batons, and they caught me and a dozen other gamblers. They took ropes and tied our hands together tightly, like a long string of boiled crabs. I said: Anyway, I'm just sitting at home, and sitting in jail is also sitting. It won't be lonely with a dozen people going together, let's go. When we got two or three li away from Guanyintang, the police and the gamblers negotiated the terms. Some spent five yuan, some ten yuan, some gave their watches to them, and some said with a sad face that there was an eighty-three-year-old mother at home. Because of this, Brother Wei Cheng, the gamblers were all given a royal pardon and released, except for me. They said I was the boss who took a cut of the gambling money, so I couldn't be released."

No matter what you do, you must exert all your strength. This "strength" is the factor that determines the success or failure of your future career.

Every reasonable aspiration and wish is absolutely achievable.

The world's biggest loser is "hesitation"! What a waste

### A Record of "Famine Prevention Drill"

— Wang Ye

There are said to be three ways to prevent hunger: first, swallow saliva; second, tighten your belt; and third, sleep. I "just listened" to these three methods and haven't "tried them on the spot" to see if they are effective. However, because the days ahead are long and life is difficult, and days of hunger may come, I decided to conduct a "field exercise" at dinner time. This "exercise" also took one hundred and twenty points of determination and risked a stomach ache.

"Official, let's eat."

"I'm not eating." I looked at my book while swallowing a mouthful of saliva.

"Don't you feel well?"

"I'm not eating!"

So the "other party" had nothing to say.

For a minute, a quarter of an hour, the sound of lips smacking and the clatter of bowls and chopsticks rang endlessly in my ears. I probably swallowed more than a dozen mouthfuls of saliva. It was okay at first, but the more I swallowed, the more "bland and tasteless" it became.

By the time those people had finished eating, it was past nine o'clock. I swallowed countless mouthfuls of saliva. At the same time, my stomach also began to sing an "empty city strategy," with the "cooing" sound of "pigeons" providing the soundtrack.

I thought: It's time to use the second method. So I stood up and pulled my belt hard. Not good! The "pigeon" cried... "Coo..."

After alternating these "actions" in turn, I barely made it to lights out and went to bed. I was already burning with hunger, and I was dizzy... The third method is sleep!

Sleeping is more effective—I thought.

In fact, the reality was completely different! On normal days, I could think about anything under the sun, but now I couldn't. Horizontally, I remembered hunger, and vertically, I remembered hunger. Ultimately, I still remembered that there was nothing in my stomach.

Later, I secretly got up from the snoring and ate a large piece of cold pot crust... and finally closed my eyes.

"Failure is the mother of success." I want to "succeed" and prepare to be a "son" again!
