### Artillery Battles on the Egyptian Front Between Both Sides

Rome, 27th, from the Havas News Agency:

The Italian High Command announced that artillery and air battles occurred yesterday in the operations and on the front lines between the enemy and our forces. As a result, eight British aircraft were shot down. Another aircraft was shot down by anti-aircraft fire over Tobruk.

The local airport was also bombed, and several aircraft were destroyed on the ground. Kufra is traditionally known as a mysterious place in the world. In 1922, Ms. Forbes personally visited the area, marking the beginning of European involvement.

### Wavell Emphasizes the Importance of Burma's Position

Stockholm, 28th, from the Central News Agency:

According to dispatches from New Delhi, British Commander-in-Chief in India, Wavell, issued a statement yesterday emphasizing the importance of the East Asian war situation and the necessity of recapturing Burma, fully demonstrating the significant impact on British India following the Japanese occupation of Burma. The main points of the statement are as follows: Since the fall of Burma, I have always felt the need to recapture that area. Burma is a strategic location for operations against Japan, and it is also a very suitable base for communication with Chongqing. Therefore, it is necessary to recapture that area regardless. However, the recapture operation is indeed a difficult problem, especially the matter of replenishment. The position of the British forces in India is extremely difficult, and the war situation in Egypt and the North Caucasus also poses a significant threat to us. However, this situation appears to be slightly easing. As for the anti-British movement in India, it has had a significant impact on the war situation, but the situation has not yet reached its worst point.

### German Submarine Sinks American Troop Transport

Berlin, 28th, from the Havas News Agency:

Rome, 27th, from the Havas News Agency:

Various newspapers took the opportunity of the second anniversary of the establishment of the Tripartite Pact to write articles in praise, stating that the naval cooperation of the Tripartite Alliance is the most powerful proof that Japan, Germany, and Italy are as close as brothers and share life and death together.

### Full Text of German Foreign Minister's Speech

Berlin, 27th, from the Havas News Agency:

Today is the anniversary of the signing of the Tripartite Pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop hosted representatives from the German military and political circles and ambassadors from the signatory countries of the Tripartite Pact, and delivered a speech on the spot. Japanese Ambassador General Oshima, Italian Ambassador Alfieri, and German military representatives Field Marshal Keitel, Propaganda Department representative Dietrich, and others were present. His speech briefly stated that when Germany, Italy, and Japan signed the Tripartite Pact in Berlin two years ago, its main purpose was to warn US President Roosevelt and his Jewish partisans that if they still ignored public opinion and instigated the American people to engage in war, they would inevitably encounter joint action. Therefore, this pact was only defensive in nature, intending to prevent the spread of war. The reason for this war was provoked by international merchants. The US participation in the war only prolonged the war. Therefore, there was a way to avoid it, but President Roosevelt ignored it and instead took open war actions, trying to obstruct a peaceful resolution with a fait accompli. The countries of the Tripartite Pact have been patient for many years, hoping that the reason of the American people will eventually control their president's inappropriate actions. But the war finally broke out. Therefore, this war can be called Roosevelt's personal war. In order to make the United States participate in the war, he even proposed conditions related to the national honor to Japan. Therefore, Japan had to fight. Today, the unity of Germany, Italy, and Japan is becoming stronger and stronger, and they will share weal and woe in the future. They will never put down their weapons until the lives of the people and the establishment of a new order are guaranteed. The countries of the Tripartite Pact are indeed the strongest group of countries in the world, unprecedented in the world. Speaking of the war in the East, I believe that with the bravery of the German army, it will eventually defeat the enemy in the Battle of Stalingrad. This battle will be a symbol of the European free struggle. Once the city of Stalingrad falls, the Soviet Union will be isolated from north to south and will not be able to recover. It is expected that the Soviet Union will encounter major difficulties at the end of this summer, because it will lose most of its raw materials and industrial areas. In short, Germany and its allies have now occupied 1.6 million square kilometers of Soviet territory, including a population of 90 million people. More than half of its territory in Europe has fallen into our hands. It has lost at least half of its strength, or even 75%. Moreover, since the beginning of the war, the number of casualties and prisoners of war of the Red Army has reached 14 million. In terms of resources, two-thirds of the Soviet wheat fields have been obtained by our army, almost all of the sugar-producing areas are owned by us, and 60% to 70% of the iron ore and 95% of the manganese ore are occupied by our army. Therefore, various factories within the Soviet Union will inevitably feel a shortage of raw materials. Not only that, but 90% of the Soviet wheat fields are under the threat of our army and cannot be transported out. The modern army cannot continue to fight without fuel and supplies. In a nutshell, a country that has suffered such heavy losses will inevitably stop the war. There is no doubt about it. As for the United Kingdom and the United States, although they have made various promises, the result is only to induce the Soviet Union to continue to sacrifice, so as to enjoy its benefits. As of now, all the convoys sailing to the Soviet Union have been completely wiped out. Germany should continue to work hard in the future to ensure that even the weakest aid from foreign countries cannot reach the Soviet Union. British Prime Minister Churchill was forced to provide various promises to the Soviet Union during his recent visit to Moscow. The Dieppe landing incident by the British army followed immediately. Everyone knows what the landing result was, so there is no need to repeat it. The German army is now prepared to repel all attempts of this nature. The German army and its allied forces have sufficient strength. Even if Churchill and Roosevelt try to open a second, third, or any other battlefield to prevent the Soviet Union from gradually developing new concepts, we have nothing to fear. It is especially worth mentioning the great victories won by the Axis naval and air forces in various sea areas. In the past year, our navy has sunk at least twice as much enemy merchant tonnage as it has built. No matter how vigorously the United Kingdom and the United States promote their shipbuilding plans, we can improve the rate of submarine construction at any time to continue sinking more enemy ships. This destructive power will be beyond the reach of the shipbuilding rate of the United Kingdom and the United States. Maritime transportation is a serious problem for the enemy. This problem is almost impossible to solve. If there are no merchant ships for transporting troops and supplies, all the talk about opening a second battlefield will be empty talk. As for the current position of the Axis powers, it can be analyzed as follows: 1. Food supply problem: The various major needs of the European people have been met. The conquest of the agricultural areas of the Don and Kuban rivers has enabled the Axis powers to obtain huge amounts of wheat, which is not only enough for Germany and Italy, but also for other regions of Europe. The food situation is improving year by year. 2. There is no need to worry about the supply of raw materials. All important resources in Europe, including resources downstream of the Volga River and those that can be produced in the Far East, can be used by us. 3. The military equipment production problem: The military equipment of the German army and its allied forces has surpassed the enemy in terms of quantity and quality, especially in terms of manpower. The countries of the Tripartite Pact are now in a situation where no matter how vigorously the United Kingdom and the United States exert themselves, they will never be able to challenge their enemies. The United Kingdom and the United States are currently conscripting manpower from 190 million people, while the Axis powers already have 450 million people available. Our industry is based on the world's major arms factories, and major shipyards in Europe and Asia are also working for us. 4. Military strategic position problem: The Axis powers are now in an impregnable position. As long as the crisis of communism exists in Europe, the German army will fight on the eastern front for one day. In the Mediterranean and Africa, the German and Italian armies will never give Britain a chance to breathe. In Europe, the German army occupies a solid line from Spain to the Norwegian border. The troops stationed on the outlying islands are also prepared to respond to any landing attacks. Air battles will intensify in the future. Whether Churchill's policy of bombing civilians is effective can be determined in the future. We must take retaliatory measures. In short, we must continue to deal with the great war. We have been well prepared. The Soviet war has greatly weakened the enemy's strength. At this moment, we are in an impregnable position in Asia and Africa. How can President Roosevelt implement his plan to conquer the two continents without ships, soldiers, and military bases, and without experience? We can only wait and see.

### America Establishes Hospital in the Near East

### We Are All Compatriots, We Are All Classmates

— Wang Jingwei

Speech at the Commemoration Ceremony of the 2493rd Anniversary of the Birth of the Former Teacher Confucius, Republic of China, September 28, 1942

We are all compatriots, and at the same time, we are all classmates. Why? Because we have a common former teacher.

Every country in the world has a so-called religion, and every religion has a so-called leader. However, this is not the case for China and East Asian countries. We only have one former teacher, only one former teacher who guides us on how to be human. This former teacher is not a former teacher of the moment, but a former teacher of ancient and modern times. He is not a former teacher of one person, but a former teacher of all Chinese compatriots and all East Asian compatriots.

Before 2493 years ago, China already had a broad and bright culture, but it was only after the former teacher that the Chinese culture was organized into a system and passed on to us. With this system, we can unite the nation, unify the country, and continue to this day. There are eternally unchanging principles and ever-changing active capabilities in this system. The former is the so-called "My Tao is consistent." The master's focus is on the already possessed. The latter is the so-called "If you can renovate yourself for one day, then do so from day to day, and again from day to day." The gentleman uses strength and solidity to make his brilliance new every day. In fact, the former indicates that we have a direction, and the latter indicates that we are constantly progressing. Today, we commemorate the former teacher, of course, not forgetting our roots, but also spurring ourselves and each other. Since we are all classmates, why are we so unworthy, humiliating the former teacher? Seven or eight years ago, Hu Shi said in a speech at the Central University that the benevolence teaching of Puyi is like the glutinous rice in rice, and the coward in people. Why did he say such contemptuous words? It was nothing more than envy of the wealth and power of others, looking down on his own motherland, and thus blaming his ancestors. We only need to refute him with one sentence: If we say that China is weak because of the benevolence teaching, then Japan also respects the former teacher. Why is it so strong? Since we are all classmates, we should strive for the former teacher and not humiliate the former teacher. Following the instructions of the former teacher, we can truly achieve this path, though foolish, we must be wise, though gentle, we must be strong. We should arouse the spirit and effort of those who can do it once, those who can do it ten times, and those who can do it a hundred times, and shoulder the responsibility of restoring China and share the mission of defending East Asia.

### No Changes in Eastern Caucasus, Fierce Fighting North of Stalingrad

Berlin, 28th, from the Hai Tong News Agency:

Yesterday, the attack of the Soviet army several times on the German positions north of Leningrad ended with heavy losses due to the fierce German artillery fire and the bombing by the German fighter and destroyer squadrons. Many enemy tanks were heavily damaged and retreated in defeat. The German army north of Doupos, with the assistance of German aircraft, made further progress. The German destroyer squadrons shot down six Soviet aircraft on the southern road of Eastern Europe yesterday.

Somewhere on the Soviet Border, 27th, from the Havas News Agency:

Apart from the German army intensifying its attacks on Stalingrad and the Caucasus, there have been no major changes on the eastern front. In the Stalingrad area, the German army continued to make progress in the south and launched a fierce attack on the northern defense line last night while the Soviet troops were exhausted after a long battle, in order to relieve the pressure of the Red Army on the German defense line between the Don and Volga rivers. The Soviet troops have been driven back to the vicinity of Dubavka. As for the Terek River in the Caucasus, fierce fighting is still taking place in Mostdok and upstream of the Terek River. However, the Soviet troops are resisting strongly, and the weather is also becoming increasingly unfavorable. Therefore, the German army's progress is very slow. Although there are still battles in the Caucasus, there is not much change.

Lisbon, 28th, from the Hai Tong News Agency:

The government agency "Maha Daily Military Communication" stated that the summer war on the eastern front has not yet ended, and the hardships of this winter for the Soviet Union are inevitable due to heavy losses. The Axis forces are still taking the offensive, and even continuing to make progress on some fronts. The Axis powers' victory in the summer is not only a military success, but also caused heavy losses to the Soviet army in terms of materials and manpower. The number of prisoners of war falling into the hands of the German army exceeds one million, and the number of dead and wounded is even more than this number. The Soviet army's loss of war materials is very difficult to replenish, and the damage to its industry is even greater. As for the loss of Soviet territory, such as the Donets region and the fall of the Caucasus, it is an irreparable loss. Therefore, the war this winter will not be the same as the war last winter, because the Soviet Union lacks a large reserve of manpower and material resources.

Moscow, 27th, from the Havas News Agency:

The Soviet High Command issued a war report stating that on the 27th of this month, our army fought fiercely with the enemy in Stalingrad, Mostdok, and Sinyavino. In the Stalingrad urban area, the enemy army made slight progress. However, our army was extremely active in the north of the city and repelled the enemy's fierce counterattack. On the Mostdok front, our army was forced to abandon a village due to being outnumbered. In the Novorossiysk area, our army occupied several high grounds and a village. There were no changes on other lines.

Helsinki, 27th, from the Havas News Agency:

The Finnish High Command issued a communiqué today stating that a Red Army unit of 30 men was wiped out by one of our units in the Onos Isthmus yesterday. Several enemy aircraft dropped bombs and bombed a certain place on the west bank of Lake Ladoga, causing minimal damage to the ground.

Bern, 28th, from the Havas News Agency:

According to the Tass News Agency, German aircraft bombed the positions of Soviet troops and Stalingrad more than 1,000 times a day. The tragic situation of the bombing of Stalingrad is no less than that of Coventry. Each bombing involves 20 or 30 aircraft simultaneously dropping bombs. The bombing force is very strong and the bombing sound is very sharp. Its purpose seems to be to threaten the defending troops, make them timid, and thus lose their combat effectiveness.

### German Army Repulses Strong Attempts by Soviet Army to Cross the Niva River in the Central and Northern Routes

Berlin, 28th, from the Hai Tong News Agency:

It has just been reported from the front that the German army and its allied forces have made progress in Stalingrad and the Caucasus. In Stalingrad, the German army has occupied several more areas. The German and Slovak troops in the northwest Caucasus fought fiercely for a long time and seized several heavily defended high grounds. Yesterday, the Soviet support vehicles attacked the German army in Stalingrad from the north and south without success and retreated. The Soviet army in the central and northern routes has launched several attacks near Erchiv, southeast of Lake Ilmen, and south of Lake Ladoga, but were all repelled. The Soviet army's attempts to secretly cross the Niva River failed several times, losing a total of 395 ships.

Berlin, 28th, from the Hai Tong News Agency:

Military sources here said that when the Soviet army attempted to cross the Niva River and break through the German defense line near Leningrad over the weekend, it lost 395 small boats, hundreds of people were captured, and a large number of war materials fell into the hands of the German army. The Soviet army began to cross the river on the early morning of the previous day, taking advantage of the fog, but was discovered and was fiercely attacked. Although a part of the Soviet army reached the opposite bank, it was also wiped out by the German army.

Berlin, 28th, from the Havas News Agency:

The High Command announced this morning that the enemy's attempt to break through the German encirclement line around Leningrad's eastern perimeter and intended to cross the Niva River with a large force has been repelled. The enemy's losses were heavy. The number of Soviet ships attempting to transport troops across the Niva River and being sunk has reached 395. Sixteen enemy aircraft were shot down.

Berlin, 28th, from the Havas News Agency:

According to military sources here, the Soviet army's diversionary offensives on the north and south sides of Stalingrad have been eliminated by intense German artillery fire. The Soviet tank team's attempt to concentrate and attack was also crushed by the German air force flying at low altitude. The Soviet army's attacks with large tank teams north of Erchiv and southeast of Lake Ilmen were also repelled. In the Stalingrad urban area, the German army advanced northward yesterday and the occupied area was cleared after fierce fighting.

### The Soviet Union's Passage Through the Straits is Considered Impossible by Turkish Officials

Ankara, 27th, Havas News Agency Dispatch

Regarding the Soviet Black Sea Fleet's passage through the Turkish Dardanelles and Bosphorus Straits to enter the Mediterranean in the future, Turkish officials informally expressed their opinion for the first time today, believing that this act contradicts the Montreux Convention (i.e., the treaty stipulating the neutral status of the two straits). This view was expressed by Rudak, who has always been regarded as the government's mouthpiece. It is said that the British interpretation of the treaty seems to state that a belligerent party's fleet may pass through the straits if there is no other access point. Therefore, British legal experts believe that once all Soviet Black Sea ports are occupied by German forces, the country's ships should be allowed to pass through the straits to the Mediterranean and may be allowed to sail to other Soviet ports on other seas. All of these statements are inconsistent with the true meaning of the treaty. Upon examination, the words of the Montreux Convention are precise and allow for no misinterpretation. It stipulates that warships of belligerent countries cannot pass through the Turkish straits, only those ships that quickly departed from their home ports before the outbreak of war are allowed to return to their original base. In other words, if Soviet troops were cruising somewhere in the Aegean Sea or the Mediterranean long before the outbreak of war, they would be allowed to return to their Black Sea base, or if a British ship were staying in the Black Sea before the outbreak of war, it would also be allowed to sail to the Mediterranean. Other than this, there is no other interpretation. Political figures here recently commented on Sadak's statement, generally believing that it represents the government's intention to refute the various rumors that have recently arisen overseas due to the visit of U.S. President Roosevelt's special envoy, Willkie. The rumor was that Willkie had discussed the issue of the Soviet fleet passing through the straits with Turkish authorities. In view of the official statement today, the truth should be revealed.

### British Troops in Madagascar Advance to Moromanga

Lisbon, 28th, Central News Agency Dispatch

According to a dispatch from London, after British troops occupied Antananarivo, the capital of Madagascar, they are now advancing eastward and occupied Moromanga, 80 kilometers east of the capital, on the 27th.

Vichy, 27th, Havas News Agency Dispatch

According to dispatches from Madagascar, French troops there are continuing to resist the British forces. Skirmishes between the two sides' outposts are very active near Behinky, 25 miles south of Antananarivo. The French army has now built new positions. On the morning of the 26th of this month, the enemy launched an attack under the cover of artillery fire, but after our army's strong resistance, many enemy soldiers were captured.

### U.S. Fleet Deputy Commander Discusses the Pacific War Situation

Pearl Harbor, 27th, Havas News Agency Dispatch

Rear Admiral Halsey, Deputy Commander of the Pacific Fleet, recently declared at an official gathering here that the war is just beginning, and we are deeply aware that the situation in the Pacific cannot be changed overnight, and we are deeply aware that we are still unable to compete with the enemy on an equal footing.

### U.S. Presidential Envoy Willkie Arrives in Chongqing; London Receives a Deep Impression Regarding the Issue of Opening a Second Front

Lisbon, 28th, Allied News Agency Dispatch

According to reports from Chongqing, U.S. President Roosevelt's special envoy, Willkie, arrived in Chongqing yesterday, having traveled from Moscow via Xinjiang.

Saigon, 28th, Haitian News Agency Dispatch

Roosevelt's special envoy, Willkie, arrived in Xinjiang yesterday afternoon and transferred to Chongqing.

Stockholm, 28th, Haitian News Agency Dispatch

Willkie's description of the difficulties encountered by the Soviet Union and the urgency of the request to open a second front has made a deep impression on London. The London correspondent of the Daily News stated that although British officials have optimistic talks, the people's anxiety about the situation is growing day by day. Britain's greatest concern is that the German army will deploy a large force in Western Europe in the winter to prevent British and American attacks. After being subjected to pressure from the authorities, the British people no longer discuss the opening of a second front and leave this issue to the government to resolve. However, the people are extremely dissatisfied with the slowness of the British and American forces. Although the internal politics of Britain are unlikely to be difficult at present, if the British army in Egypt is still unable to launch an offensive in the next few months, a political crisis will inevitably be difficult to avoid. Therefore, London believes that the British army's offensive in Egypt is imminent.

London, 27th, Havas News Agency Dispatch

Lord Strabolgi, a Labour Party peer, stated in a speech in Wimbledon today that it is undeniable that the British people are anxious, because the people know that the German army is fighting the Soviet Union with all its strength, while we have not done anything against Germany in Western Europe. The remarks made by U.S. President Roosevelt's special envoy, Willkie, in Moscow yesterday deserve special attention. The British Cabinet should respond to them immediately. It is known that the best time to attack Germany was in July of this year, but we have already missed the opportunity.

Lisbon, 28th, Haitian News Agency Dispatch

British Dominions Secretary Major Attlee gave a broadcast speech in Ottawa last night, stating that the British people should not forget to maintain a unified country while realizing their goals and should not be influenced by the various demands made by irresponsible people. Ottawa believes that Attlee's remarks against those who demand the opening of a second front and his statement that it is unfair to state the burden of the Allied countries is enemy propaganda.

Stockholm, 28th, Haitian News Agency Dispatch

London dispatch: British Under-Secretary of State for War Croft replied to the Soviet Union's request to open a second front in a speech last night, saying that the United Kingdom has been forced to fight on thirteen fronts, and the enemy forces it has encountered are extremely strong.

Stockholm, 28th, Haitian News Agency Dispatch

According to the London Daily Express, the prerequisites for the Allied forces to land in Europe are absolute air supremacy and a large number of ships, both of which are currently lacking. The report stated that a famous British reporter, Colvin, believes that the Allied forces may attack the European continent within ten days. If this opportunity is missed, a second front cannot be opened this year.

According to newspapers, U.S. Ambassador to Turkey Steinhardt returned to Washington from Adana by plane yesterday to report to President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull. He was accompanied by his wife and private secretary.

### The Soviet Union's Paradise—Caucasus (3)

Seven Republics

From the above, it can be seen that the Caucasus is actually inhabited by a large number of ethnic groups. Since Russia was changed to the Soviet Union, all ethnic groups have been allowed to be autonomous and independent. In addition to the majority of autonomous counties and autonomous regions, there are two republics in Inner Caucasus, the Guria Autonomous Republic and the Dagestan Autonomous Republic. The Outer Caucasus is composed of five republics: the Gelidia Independent Republic, the Abkhazia Autonomous Republic, the Adige Autonomous Republic, the Armenian Autonomous Republic, and the Azerbaijan Independent Republic. These republics are of course subordinate to the Soviet Union as national autonomous bodies.

It is rare in the world to have seven republics in such a small area.

Mountain Agriculture

Although the Caucasus is a narrow mountainous area, agriculture is quite prosperous. The Inner Caucasus, with its many black soil layers, has a rich harvest of grains. The Outer Caucasus produces corn, wheat, and rice, and the cultivation of tobacco and grapes is prevalent throughout the Caucasus. In addition, the Outer Caucasus cultivates mulberry trees and cotton, and tea is planted near Batumi on the Black Sea coast.

The Caucasus is also very suitable for horticulture, especially in the Black Sea coast area. Not only does it produce high-quality apples, pears, and peaches, but even oranges, lemons, and olives are propagated near Batumi.

The Caucasus has a high and considerable grape yield, so winemaking has become a thriving industry in the area, but the quality of the wine is not very good. Other industries such as animal husbandry, fishing, forestry, and hunting are also quite developed, but the most important industry in the Caucasus is of course the oil extraction industry. This is not only a resource of the Caucasus but also a treasure trove of the entire Soviet Union.

Vast Oil Fields

The oil in the Caucasus is extracted in the villages of Kevesnovo and Makoba near Baku along the Caspian Sea. About 3,000 years ago, people who traveled to this area saw natural fires burning on the ground and thought they were divine fires, so they built temples for worship. Today, the temple of this fire-worshiper still exists.

Oil extraction here only began in recent years, about 100 years ago, and only recently has the latest scientific method been used for oil extraction. Since the oil wells were dug and oil could be extracted, speculators with some capital have gathered here to buy small-scale mining areas and use drilling machines to explore the oil layers. Today, the mining area is lined with new-style drilling platforms and extraction platforms, which from a distance look like dense jungles. In terms of oil production, the Caucasus is in first place in Europe and second only to the United States in the world.

The Soviet Paradise

The Caucasus and Crimea are known as the two major paradises of the Soviet Union, and it can be said that no Russian does not yearn for the Caucasus. It is very reasonable for Russians living in the monotonous, desolate, and cold northern country to admire the Caucasus, a southern country with excellent scenery.

There are noble villas and palaces of the Tsar everywhere in the Caucasus. In the era of the Tsarist Russia, the rich and nobles came here to avoid the cold in winter and to escape the summer heat in summer. There are also those who want to eat fresh fruits, those who want to paint landscapes, and those who want to come into contact with exotic customs and human feelings. All must take a trip to the Caucasus, and hot springs gush everywhere in the mountains, and even patients must come here for treatment. The former palaces, villas, and hot spring resorts have now been nationalized and become rest homes for officials. The originally beautiful Caucasus is now fully open to free Russians.

### Pyatigorsk City

The city runs along the Kuban River and is a modern cultural city. The tall building in the center is a monastery, behind which is the Kuban River. The climate is pleasant, there are many hot springs, and the agricultural products are abundant. It is also a large oil-producing area and is famous for producing beautiful women. It is truly a paradise of the Soviet Union.

### Painting White Powder Markings on Sidewalks of Roads in Both Concessions to Guide the Safety of Vehicles, Domestic Residents and Pedestrians During the Ten-Day Blackout Period

The English-language *Shanghai Times* stated that, in preparation for the air raid warning drill beginning October 1st, white powder markings have been painted on the sidewalks, road corners, and wire netting used to block the roads in the two concessions of this port, so as to facilitate the safety of vehicles, domestic residents and pedestrians during the ten-day blackout period.

Massive Sales of Black Lampshades

After the addition of traffic regulations during the blackout period, most of the street lights were dismantled. The headlights of various domestic vehicles were painted black, and the sidewalks and road corners have also begun to be painted with white powder markings. Housewives have paid high prices to stores to purchase black lampshades and curtains for use in the warning drill starting on October 1st. Because the authorities have actively reminded citizens to pay attention to air defense equipment, these blackout-related items have been sold in large quantities. During the drill, the lights do not need to be completely turned off; it is only necessary that the light does not leak out.

Pedestrians Must Not Linger on the Roads

The traffic regulations issued by the Public Works Department on Saturday, which will take effect on October 1st, state that no pedestrian may stop or wander on the road and should walk on the sidewalk on the left side. It also states that pedestrians should walk on the sidewalk. If there is no sidewalk, they should walk as close as possible to the edge of the road. Pedestrians must cross the road only at designated crossing points. The regulations also state that, except for fire, police, and military vehicles, the speed of cars and trams must not exceed ten miles per hour. Vehicles should drive slowly and may only turn at intersections.

Parking Lights Are Prohibited

The regulations also state that cars may not overtake other cars traveling in the same direction on the roads of the Public Concession. Horns or bells may not be used except in emergencies. The headlights of cars must be painted black, leaving a half-inch horizontal strip painted white from the bottom of the light. When parking on any section of the road, one or more lights must be lit in accordance with the licensing regulations, but the lights must be fully painted over.

Vehicle Lights Should be Securely Mounted

Lights on man-powered vehicles such as private rickshaws, public rickshaws, wheelbarrows, small carts, carriages, pedicabs, bicycles, tricycles, or trailers should be securely mounted and should not shake with the movement of the vehicle. The lights should be painted black, leaving a half-inch horizontal strip painted white from the bottom of the light. These vehicles should travel on the left side of the road, close to the curb. The six-inch area of the rear mudguards of public and private rickshaws and pedicabs should be painted white or pasted with white paper.

Street Lights in Lanes and Alleys Begin to be Removed

According to reports from Datong News Agency reporters, the authorities of the Public Concession dispatched a large number of employees yesterday (starting on the 28th) to remove street lights in the lanes and alleys of various districts. It is expected that they will be completely dismantled by the end of this month. The French Concession is also taking the same steps as the Public Concession, gradually reducing the number of street lights. It is estimated that nine out of ten street lights on the roads north and south of the Suzhou Creek in the Public Concession have been removed.

Five Model Districts Practiced Yesterday Evening

Last night, the Central, Old Zha, and Chengdu districts of the Public Concession held a preliminary practice of blackout in the model districts designated by them. The scope of this drill was part of the Central District within the area north from Nanjing Road, south to Jiujiang Road, east to Henan Road, and west to Shanxi Road; part of the Old Zha District within the area north from Nanjing Road, south to Jiujiang Road, east to Zhejiang Road; and part of the Chengdu District in the Tongfu Road, Xieqiao Lane, and Weihaiwei Road area. The drill time was from 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM, and Goro Matsumoto, Deputy Chief of Police and Liaison Officer of the Air Defense Section, went to inspect. The French Concession also held a similar drill last night in the Luban Road and Avenue Joffre area. In addition to personnel from the Avenue Joffre police station assisting during the drill, Fabre, the superintendent of the French police, also personally went to inspect.

### Confucian Ceremony at the Confucius Temple in the Southern City

Yesterday was the 2,493rd anniversary of the birth of Confucius. The municipal government held a Confucian ceremony in the Confucius Temple in the southern city yesterday morning. More than 2,000 people from all walks of life attended, and the atmosphere was enthusiastic.

### Hoping That Citizens Will Pay Attention to Private Collection of Donations Under the Guise of the Baojia System

The Shanghai French Concession authorities announced that the Baojia funds in this concession have been donated voluntarily by residents since the beginning. Recently, there have been rumors that some people have collected money from residents in the name of Baojia funds. This kind of action is not right. The Baojia charitable donations are directly sent by the donors to the Baojia Accounting Office in the Central District Police Station for verification and receipt, and a receipt is issued as proof. Private collection of fees outside of this is not only a violation of the law but also hinders the Baojia process. Therefore, in addition to the charitable donations directly delivered to the Baojia Accounting Office, no matter what the name is, residents shall not be charged any fees. This announcement is made so that everyone is aware.

### American Nationals’ Armbands Have Begun to be Collected

Distribution Ends at the End of this Month

The English-language *Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury* stated that, in accordance with the regulations of the Shanghai Japanese Gendarmerie, the American Association began distributing armbands to American nationals in this port this morning (28th). At the same time, the British Residents' Association began distributing armbands last Saturday and continued to do so this morning. It is understood that the two associations will continue to process the collection of armbands by British and American nationals for the next two days (29th and 30th) in alphabetical order by the first letter of their names. These people, who are regarded as enemy nationals, will purchase these armbands for three yuan each starting on October 1st and wear them on their arms. When applying, British and American nationals must present their passes or residence permits issued by their consulates.

### Unified Retail Price of Cigarettes and Lottery Tickets in the French Concession

Since the resumption of business by the Tobacco and Lottery Industry Association of the French Concession, only a little over two months have passed. Procedures such as registration of members have been completed. On September 25, the association received an order from the French Concession Goods Evaluation Committee, ordering all members to sell their products at the first assessed price. Because the matter was of official importance, the association rushed to print the price list and notified all members to sell their products at the first approved assessed prices without increasing or decreasing them; otherwise, they would be penalized by the authorities and would not be protected. However, it is said that many types of cigarettes in the first price list cannot be sold due to cost reasons. Yesterday, the association recommended three representatives, Xu Wenxiang, Zhang Xianneng, and Shen Kaida, to visit Mr. Hu Dongyang, the director of the Goods Evaluation Committee of the French Municipal Council, to request instructions on how to handle the cigarettes that cannot be sold due to cost reasons. Mr. Hu Dongyang issued an order to consider the difficulties of the merchants and that the various types of cigarettes that cannot be sold should be reported to the authorities with sufficient reasons and evidence. Before approval is granted, the goods should be returned to the tobacco company to avoid losses to the industry and maintain business.

### Changes in Management at Mitsui Bank in Shanghai

According to the Shanghai Daily News, Yuga Toyoichiro, the former manager of the Mitsui Bank's continued branch, has been appointed as the manager of the Shanghai branch of the bank, and Kagami Masaru, the manager of the Shanghai branch, has been promoted to the position of the head of the Foreign Affairs Department at the bank's head office in Tokyo.

### Suicide of a Hospital Patient

A local youth, Lin Shiai, 21 years old, residing at 670 Avenue Joffre, had been suffering from lung disease for three years. Recently, his condition had gradually worsened. On the 15th of this month, his brother, Lin Shijin (an employee of Xinyi Pharmaceutical Factory), sent him to Guangci Hospital for treatment. Shiai felt that he had little taste for life due to the torment of the disease, and he had a sudden impulse. At 9:30 AM the day before yesterday, he jumped from the balcony on the fourth floor of the hospital and injured his waist when he fell to the ground. A nurse discovered him and carried him to the emergency room for treatment, but he died an hour later. The hospital reported to the police station, who carried the body to the morgue for inspection. The family claimed the body and sent it to the funeral parlor.

### Minister of Information Yokoyama Praises the Tripartite Pact in a Broadcast

According to the Allied News Agency, Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama, Minister of Information of the Japanese Army, praised the Tripartite Pact on the Greater East Asia Radio Station on Sunday evening as the most powerful document in history and of great benefit to the survival and prosperity of mankind. The Tripartite Pact is a seamless fusion of the Axis powers' efforts to jointly build a new world order. In his half-hour speech on the Greater East Asia Radio Station, Mr. Yokoyama pointed out that the ultimate goal of the Axis powers' pact is to enable all countries in the world to join this pact. He requested that the five countries of Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Slovakia, and Croatia, which have signed night aid agreements, should adopt the spirit of the Axis pact. For the sake of realizing the spirit of universal brotherhood, the Japanese people should embrace the idea of using the stones of other mountains to polish their own jade.

### The Self-Defense Corps' Trial Period has Ended; Official Establishment set for Double Tenth Festival; Stabilizing the Organization to Assist in Public Security Work; Promotional Campaign is Being Actively Prepared

A senior official of the Public Works Department Police Department stated yesterday that the Self-Defense Corps in the Public Concession, which has 450,000 members, has been in existence for more than seven months since its establishment, but it is still in the nature of a trial in terms of organization. Now, in order to stabilize the organization and permanently assist the police authorities in maintaining public security, it has been decided to announce its official establishment on the tenth day of next month at midnight. At the same time, necessary adjustments will be made to the internal upper and lower levels of the organization. The Baojia Guidance Committee has issued an order to the Baojia chiefs of each district to urge the members of the Self-Defense Corps in their respective districts to step up their efforts. After holding a publicity conference the day before yesterday, the Baojia Guidance Committee decided to start a comprehensive and expanded publicity week starting on October 1. Because the time is very tight, preparations are being stepped up to launch this historic publicity campaign as scheduled. Committees have been appointed in advance to carry out publicity in the fields of journalism, film, broadcasting, and entertainment. In addition, there will be lectures, publicity, photography exhibitions, and the printing of colored leaflets, slogans, and special publications. A Baojia charity race will also be held, and the proceeds from the ticket sales will be used to fund the Baojia. Because the scale of this publicity campaign is very large, a large Baojia publicity and fundraising conference will be held at the Ningbo Fellow Association on Yu Qiaqing Road at 2:00 PM tomorrow.

### Street Lights are Extinguished in Night Markets; Beware of Petty Criminal Activity

The city is scheduled to hold air defense exercises starting on October 1 and implement a blackout. The authorities have decided to remove or reduce the number of street lights on various roads, resulting in extremely dark roads at night. Common petty criminals (commonly known as "pig peelers") will take the opportunity to be active. Although the police authorities have long been aware of this, they are still concerned that they will not be able to provide sufficient care. It is hoped that each Baojia district will assign a group of Self-Defense Corps members to form a Self-Defense Corps night patrol team (one team of three people per Baojia). This will make public security more strict and the public will benefit a lot.

### All Circles of Society are Preparing a Charity Ball

Travel Correspondence

### Hangzhou Trip (Part 2)

— Qian Zhiren

According to the owners of the jewelry stores (women selling jewelry is a specialty), jewelry stores in Hangzhou currently have no jewelry. As soon as goods arrive, people meticulously inspect them and buy them quickly. These buyers are either customers from Shanghai or local competitors. They buy briskly without being picky, unlike regular customers who haggle over every item, and in the end, the business often fails. Selling to peers is much better than selling in the store, which makes a lot of sense.

Almost every watch store and small jewelry store in Qixia area has a sign posted in front of their doors saying "We buy gold and silver watches," all written in Japanese, obviously not advertisements for the locals.

The department stores in Qixia are still department stores, but the merchandise is different, and the owners are different. Once in Qixia, it feels like Hongkou in Shanghai. Almost all the stores that exist in Japan now exist here. Chinese stores' posters, etc., are obviously influenced. For example, the signboard of a carving shop reads "Seal Shop," and the slogan of a general merchandise store reads "General Trading Company."

Upscale barbershops charge four yuan for a haircut and two and a half yuan for a shave, just like in Shanghai. Recently, the New National Movement has banned ear cleaning. All barbershops have such notices. Bathhouses have price lists in Japanese currency. Bathing costs forty to sixty qian, and back scrubbing is thirty to forty qian. Massage is the same as back scrubbing. While bathing in the tub, you can hear people humming popular tunes.

### Transportation in Hangzhou

Hangzhou also has public buses that run on charcoal, departing from Qixia and going to Gongchen Bridge and the riverside. Since there was no test ride, the fare is unknown. Naturally, rickshaw fares have also risen. You can't find one for less than one yuan. A short trip costs two yuan. If it rains, it's even harder to find a rickshaw. Even if you offer a high price, the rickshaw pullers will ignore you. The most common sight on the road is military training vehicles, and there are also a few cars. As for private cars, they are very rare and are used by important figures. Moreover, there is often a red "日" (sun) sign on the back of the car.

Hiring a boat to tour the lake is not popular, and the prices are not high. Renting a boat for half a day only costs about ten yuan. More than a dozen old boats are piled up at the pier next to the Lakeside Park, which shows that the boats are not used much.

Bicycles are not common in Hangzhou. Most people use their legs because rickshaw fares are expensive.

### Gold, Stone, Calligraphy, and Painting in Hangzhou

There are many used bookstores in Hangzhou, but most of the books are very ordinary. It's hard to find practical books, let alone rare ones. Book prices are comparable to those in Shanghai, or even more expensive. In a bookstore called Songjing Hall, I saw two incomplete copies of Ming Dynasty Min-carved skin-paper illustrated records of events, and they were asking for one hundred and twenty yuan. You can imagine how expensive they are. The bookstore owners all say that there are no good books. Anything slightly better has been taken away by Shanghai peers. Two of the owners were old acquaintances, and they took out a few seal engraving manuals to show me. They were indeed good books, priced in military currency. One of them was priced at 250 Japanese yen with a receipt as proof, indeed accurate. Selling to old customers at a particularly low price would still cost over a thousand yuan. Although there are more rubbings, most of them are single pieces mounted and framed, and they have all flowed into the calligraphy and painting sales locations in Shanghai, such as tea parties, mounting shops, and antique shops. 98% of all goods are untrustworthy. There are still many old porcelains, such as Yue ware and Longquan ware, and they are genuine, and the prices are not very high. Unfortunately, they are inconvenient to carry, so it's better to save some money. Stone seals are produced in Zhejiang, Hangzhou, and it is also a cultural area. Moreover, with the founding of the Xiling Seal Art Society, it is usually easy to get stone seals. However, it is difficult to find a pair of slightly better Qingtian stones, and the prices are very expensive. Chicken blood stone and Changhua stone have long become like gold, and a small pair of inch-long Qingtian stones that are not old are priced at sixty yuan, which shows how expensive they are. As for old ink, as long as it's from the Jiaqing and Daoguang periods, it has all been taken away by Shanghai antique dealers. Therefore, if you imagine going to Hangzhou to pan for cultural gold, it's hard to succeed. Even if you do find it, the price will definitely not be cheaper than in Shanghai. (The End)

### Tongren Cup Table Tennis League: Qinglian Wins Group Championship, Comes from Behind to Beat Post Office 4-3

The Tongren Cup All-Shanghai Charity Table Tennis Tournament's group final between the Post Office and Qinglian was held yesterday at the Xijing Stadium on Haige Road. More than 600 guests attended, making it a grand occasion. Chairman Chen Linsheng first delivered a speech, and Vice Chairman Chen Jimao reported on the overall results of the group. The competition began with the first group match, where Post Office's Jiang Chunshan defeated Qinglian's Yang Changxi with a smashing ball, rendering Yang unable to counterattack, resulting in a straight three-game loss. In the second group, Post Office's Liu Zaoshi continued the momentum and won again. In the third group, Post Office's main player Wang Huizhang faced Qinglian's Yang Changjia. Wang is a famous player in Shanghai, specializing in powerful strokes. Yang is young and his skills are pure and enthusiastic. Wang underestimated his opponent. After losing two games in a row, he tried to catch up, but it was too late. As a result, the young player won 3-0, making the first great contribution to Qinglian's victory. At this time, Qinglian's fortunes turned around, and team captain Huang Minzhi defeated Post Office's Li Guangyao, tying the score at 2-2. The fifth group match was the most intense. Post Office's Chen Wensheng took the lead all the way, but Qinglian's Zhong Zhihui seemed to be divinely assisted and reversed the defeat to win. In the sixth group, Zhu Longli was defeated by Zhang Fuwei again. In the final group, Post Office's Ye Xiuzhang fought hard, but Qinglian's Liu Baotai was less skilled and unable to resist. As a result, Qinglian came from behind and defeated Post Office 4-3 to win the group championship, which will be scheduled to compete with the Ren Group champion for the overall championship. The results of the final match between the two teams are recorded as follows:

(Qinglian) (Post Office) Score

Yang Changxi Jiang Chunshan 0—3

### Our Factory Nails and Blue Lead Iron are Both Being Searched For

The hardware market has picked up slightly since yesterday. The transactions on the side of factories in this street have shown slight signs of activity, and the atmosphere of silence has been re-emerging with vigor. This is because canneries and small workshops and other scattered users have shown extra interest in searching for our factory nails and blue lead iron (used for manufacturing cigarette boxes, iron boxes, and wooden boxes). Yesterday, the market traded more than one hundred barrels and forty to fifty boxes. The long-depressed hardware market finally became active yesterday. At night, the hearts of colleagues who have been tired for a long time also rose high. The market is stable and firm. Our factory nails are 700 yuan per bin, and the retail price is 7 yuan to 8 yuan per pound, which varies. Blue lead is 1,600 yuan per bin. Blue lead double-connected is 2,000 yuan per box.

### Guiyuan and Longan Present New Products

Usually, the earliest new goods to appear for Guiyuan and Longan are Taiwan Longan, followed by Guangdong Shima and Tong'an. The last to arrive is Xinghua Longan. However, due to inconvenient transportation, all of them have not arrived on time. Xinghua Longan, on the other hand, has a small number that has arrived early to present the new products, which makes them seem rare due to their small quantity. It is said that the asking price is about three or four hundred yuan higher than the national delivery price of Chen Xu. Yesterday, the first batch of golden round coins imported from Guangdong by the Tsukuba Maru also arrived, totaling 429 boxes, and there were also 365 pieces of new longan pulp. According to the sources, the cost is high, and there is no hope of a price reduction in the short term.

### More Than 10,000 Pieces of Jinshan Branches Arrived

The price of Jinshan branches was previously relatively low, and customers could not profit and had to lose slightly, so a few were still holding on and had not been exchanged. However, the wholesalers were able to sell their goods easily because the price was suitable, and the market was quite smooth. According to the wholesalers, the third batch has arrived, totaling more than 10,000 boxes. Due to cost factors, the price will not be lowered.

### Uniform Serge Long Silent and Ready to Move

Uniform serge is most famous for Renli Tianma Tu and Zhanghua Mianyang Tu. However, due to low prices and slow sales, coupled with the abnormal prosperity of the serge market in recent years, most serge factories have chosen to weave the items that are more profitable, resulting in a shortage of the above two types of goods. Most of the products from general small factories in the past have fallen into the hands of lay hoarders, so there are not many goods on the market and few people inquire about them. Now, the long silence is ready to move. Hoarders want to seek an exit, and some people need to purchase them. It is said that there are about 40,000 to 50,000 yards of miscellaneous brands of hand-held uniform serge. The asking price for the top grade is 45 yuan, and the asking price for the second grade is 38 yuan. The asking price for Renli Zhanghua is 68 yuan, but there are no goods available.

### National Industrial and Commercial Organization Survey

Mr. Xu Wancheng is conducting a survey of industrial and commercial organizations across the country, such as industry associations, chambers of commerce, and merchant organizations, in order to meet the needs of the national industrial and commercial community. The survey record of industrial and commercial associations across the country is being compiled and published. The Shanghai section is especially detailed. It is being published by Longwen Bookstore, Yanye Bank Building, Beijing Road. The price is set at 15 yuan per copy for pre-orders and is expected to be published by the end of next month.

Spring and Autumn

### People Who Don't Understand Broken Rice

— Zixin

If I could paint, I would paint Granny Run sitting upright in a rickshaw wearing a black top and a black skirt, her hair tied in a bun, her mouth wide open in surprise, her nose could be drawn bigger, and if I wrote the symbol (!?) on top of her head, it would probably attract more readers' attention. In front of her is a young girl riding a bicycle steadily, her face could be drawn round and plump, her tight cheongsam revealing her curves, barefoot and in shorts. In short, I could do my best to depict the so-called modern fashion. However, no matter how I depict it, it won't be as realistic as a lightly sketched cartoon. On the contrary, it will attract readers' interest. Below is a story that would be a bad choice as cartoon material because it would be difficult to please everyone.

How would you convey the meaning of this story in a cartoon? Here are two gentlemen dining opposite each other, offering each other the delicious dishes. A picked at the rice grains in his bowl and asked Brother B, is this what you call broken rice? It's not bad, the grains are white and thick, comparable to regular rice. B's answer is very interesting: Brother A, you've misunderstood, this is completely regular rice. It's rare for Brother A to visit, how could I treat you with broken rice? As for regular rice and broken rice, in my humble opinion, there shouldn't be much difference. Rice always has pointed ends, and they are mostly slightly different in size, right? It turns out that this Brother B also doesn't know what broken rice looks like. Shanghai, which has been issuing household rice for more than ten periods, actually still has people who have never seen broken rice. Try to express this meaning in a cartoon, it's harder than climbing to the sky.

### The Secret of Salaries

— Xinmeng

Salaries are supposed to be public and shouldn't be a secret. However, in today's Shanghai education sector, the salaries of faculty and staff in some schools have become a secret. This may be unique to the education sector and not found in other industries.

First, let's talk about the employment contract. Schools used to issue employment contracts to teachers as an agreement, stating the subject to be taught, the number of hours per week, the hourly rate, and the effective period of six months or one year. Recently, many schools have stopped issuing employment contracts.

Since no employment contract is issued, there is no way to know whether the employment will be renewed after the end of a semester or what the treatment will be. Even if the employment can be renewed, they still won't tell you how many hours you will teach or what the hourly rate will be. It's all kept secret in the principal's mind.

After the school starts, everyone knows how many hours they will teach, but some principals still keep the hourly rate a secret and are unwilling to tell you directly and straightforwardly. In this way, you still don't know how much income you will have each month after class.

Under these circumstances, everyone mostly cranes their necks, hoping for the first month's salary to be paid. Once the salary is paid, the secret of the salary will be revealed and can no longer be kept secret. However, some schools do not treat teachers equally. Mr. A gets four yuan per hour, and Mr. B gets five yuan per hour. This leads the teachers to keep their salaries strictly secret at the principal's suggestion, afraid that those who get less will be jealous of those who get more.

Of course, there is a reason why the principal wants to keep the salaries a secret. The golden age of Shanghai schools is over. In the past year, the number of students has generally decreased, so even the principal cannot predict how many students there will be in the next semester or how many teachers will be hired. The number of teachers naturally depends on the number of students. But the salary of each person at the beginning will not be announced because the principal still has to calculate the amount of tuition revenue and how much is left after deducting all expenses. Naturally, a loss-making business is out of the question.

### Zhan Zhan

— Huang Jia Tai

To use when one shouldn't is extravagance; to not use when one should is stinginess; to use when one should and not use when one shouldn't is thrift.

Emotion can make the clear turbid; reason can make the turbid clear.

The hunger of the brain is relatively slow; the hunger of the stomach is relatively urgent.

### Catching Mice is Not a Cat's Instinct

— Fuxin

Many people think that catching mice is a cat's instinct, just like crowing is a chicken's instinct. This view is wrong.

To address this issue, a professor at Zhejiang University conducted an experiment. He placed a pair of cats and a pair of mice that had never had contact with other cats and mice in the same room. At first, they looked at each other and appeared very unfamiliar and strange. Afterwards, they gradually became intimate and started playing with each other until the 21st century. It can be seen that they are not born to be incompatible.

People who raise cats must have this experience. When kittens grow up, the mother cat throws a half-dead mouse in front of the kittens. The kittens lie on the ground, look at the mouse, and dare not come forward. After holding on for a while, the mouse quietly tries to escape. As soon as it takes a step or two, it is bitten by the mother cat and thrown back in front of the kittens. After capturing and releasing it two or three times, the kittens dare to come forward, bite the mouse, play with it, and then slowly eat it. Therefore, if the mother cat has never taught its offspring how to catch mice, its offspring will definitely be lazy cats in the future. Similarly, if baby chicks are used as an example when teaching the next generation how to find food, then the next generation will definitely grow into ethical chicken cats.

Xue Xuan banished a large and sharp-clawed cat because it only ate chicks and did not catch mice. If it had received the education to catch mice, why wouldn't it have been able to live peacefully in the Xue family?

### Sailing in the Same Storm

— He Jia Zhi

(9) Human Hell

After another while, Cui Zhen opened her eyes, raised her face slightly, and looked at the table and the dressing table. Wei Shaoyun put his hands on his waist, took a step forward, and smiled, "What do you want? Tell me. I'm not as stingy as my old man." Cui Zhen put her head on the pillow and still looked with open eyes. Sheng Hushan spoke first: "No, no, we have to be careful of her." He quickly moved a small pear-peeling knife, a pair of pig hair tweezers, a teapot barrel, a few teacups, and a box of red phosphorus matches from the table and dressing table out of the room, muttering, "Be careful, good thing her heart is unknown. As long as she grabs one of these things, she can kill someone or commit suicide. This is not a game."

Wei Shaoyun smiled, "My brother-in-law is also honestly ridiculous. A person should always treat others with sincerity. I have been very sincere to this Miss Bian. Miss Bian's space is made of flesh and her heart is made of flesh. Seeing me like this, just now it was no acquaintance, no fighting; now we are acquainted and progressed to love. If I am as suspicious as my brother-in-law, my sister would have the possibility of murdering her husband every night. There is no such reason." Everyone laughed together when they heard this. Wei Shaoyun thought that he had moved Cui Zhen, who was sitting on the edge of the bed like A Ying, and said, "Look at my head. Why is it wrapped in cloth? Of course, you understand. I know you are very sorry in your heart, aren't you?" Cui Zhen opened her eyes before Wei Shaoyun sat on the edge of the bed. Wei Shaoyun was speaking to her with benevolence and righteousness, but she closed her eyes tightly, giving him an invisible and unheard. Wei Shaoyun extended the index finger of his right hand, first wiped it clean on his suit pants, and then used it to poke Cui Zhen's lips and smiled, "Open your eyes and talk. I'll ask everyone to retreat, okay?" As he spoke, he poked, but suddenly Cui Zhen opened her mouth and bit Wei Shaoyun's index finger. As the saying goes, "The ten fingers are connected to the heart." How could one finger not hurt when bitten? This is what Wei Shaoyun was bitten, crying and shouting, "Ouch," repeating himself.

Daily Life Tidbits

### The Discolored Auvers

— Yuan Yin

I will not forget that our office used to be a bustling market, almost a crazy marketplace.

At first, it was the sporadic visits of noble gentlemen and ladies stepping to the beat of jazz, but gradually, the not-small Auvers office was filled with this familiar crowd.

But sometimes, groups after groups would come, and Auvers could not accommodate them. Our leader, familiarly, would step into our second warehouse, which was finally filled with that familiar crowd.

Woolen fabrics were carried one by one to the counter. The resounding "poom poom" was the heavy sound of the woolen fabric meeting the wooden leaves. Various colorful plaid woolen fabrics, along with the picking and choosing of the groups, often piled the counter into a disorderly small mountain. The sounds of evaluation and bargaining, in loud, coarse, and reckless dialects, formed the most chaotic cacophony. Then, the sound of scissors and yardsticks mixed together, and the clear sound of the abacus was often regarded as part of the mixed symphony. Colleagues jumped around, pile after pile, yet never seemed to get a breath of fresh air. This often continued from eight o'clock in the morning until seven or even eight or nine o'clock in the evening. Although it was no longer office hours, the manager had told the colleagues that customers were the source of our livelihood, and we had no reason to disobey their demands.

Therefore, often our rest could only be obtained in the freedom of sleep.

But in the past few months, I suspect that our surroundings have been spun around. The situation in Auvers has changed dramatically. The bustling market of the past should not be a marketplace. In imagination, it should never have become so cold and desolate. But we are, after all, facing such a desolate life like a mountain temple, as if our office has been abandoned in the wilderness and never been discovered by people.

The manager also seems to have changed completely. The well-tailored Western suit is gone, and the plump and radiant face now looks gloomy. He no longer greets people and chats as he used to, following the familiar crowd. He appears particularly lonely, often abandoned alone in the warehouse or the Auvers office, without wandering around or resting.

Although the weather has entered autumn, the feeling of depression in our entire Auvers office has only intensified. The large gray membrane brings us a leaden mood.

High prices and sluggish business are not unreasonable.

The manager murmured to himself.

One way or another, whether it's price limits or rationing, business will never improve. Speculators have bad luck; how can we expect to benefit?

He shook his head, expressing endless emotion.

Colleagues inevitably remembered the changes in the outside market. The price limits in the gold and silk markets in recent months have also led to the loss of the familiar customers (the source of our livelihood) in our area. Thus, our so-called "wealthy business" began to hit a wall.

This is almost a mournful sigh.

The manager originally had to go to the office twice a day, morning and afternoon, but now he has automatically reduced it to less than once. Therefore, the office scenery in the afternoon is almost like a colleagues' club, everyone just hanging around.

Before four o'clock, the old clerks seemed to understand the situation and hurriedly proceeded with the closing work. So, this time it was time for everyone to stretch their lazy bodies and rest.

(Note) "Manager" refers to the manager.
