MacArthur Plans Strategy, Changes from Defense to Offense, Seeks Initiative

London, 24th (Reuters) - After General MacArthur held a frank conversation with war correspondents at his headquarters for fifty minutes, well-informed British and Australian sources in London unanimously believe that MacArthur will achieve significant results. It is widely believed that he has planned a detailed offensive strategy and has the confidence and fighting spirit to win, as well as the leadership to inspire troops to fight to the death for the Allied cause. MacArthur has been working fifteen hours a day, seven days a week, to complete his operational plan. Australian Army Minister Ford stated that MacArthur had discussed three points with his staff: the general war situation, Australia's position in the Southwest Pacific, and the assistance of American supplies. London sources generally believe that MacArthur is now preparing to thoroughly reorganize the Australian combat forces so that the Allied land, sea, and air forces in the Southwest Pacific can achieve full cooperation. It is widely believed that he has anticipated solutions to two major tasks: first, the impending Japanese invasion of Australia; and second, how to immediately transform the current defensive posture into a counteroffensive. Regarding preparations for current work, it is widely believed that the main principles of MacArthur's plan are as follows: An operations conference has been established, consisting of MacArthur himself, Brett, and the commanders of the Allied land, sea, and air forces; Training troops to become highly mobile offensive forces, therefore, the training for rapid action must be rapidly expanded; Cooperation between the land, sea, and air forces should be given sophisticated training and strengthened; Military institutions should be reformed to eliminate inefficiencies and stipulate a progressive system of rewards and promotions.

Allied Command Unified; American and Australian Air Forces Merge for Training

Canberra, 25th (Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister Curtin declared in the House of Representatives today that General MacArthur, the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in the Southwest Pacific, will be granted the authority to issue "supreme orders" in Australia. The arrangement made in February between London and Washington to divide responsibility for the Pacific region has become outdated due to the developments of the past month. This is undeniable. When the Pacific Council is established in Washington, Australia will send a representative to reside there. Australia's relationship with the various Allied nations is extremely important from now on. The entire British Empire and all the Allied nations regard this struggle with a comprehensive vision.

Saigon, 25th (Haitong News Agency) - According to reports here last night, Canberra announced yesterday that the Australian Air Force has cooperated with the U.S. Expeditionary Air Force. This measure is for the purpose of unified training for Australian and American pilots. After the training is completed, the two forces will still be separate.

President Roosevelt Declares Close Liaison Between the U.S. and New Zealand

Washington, 24th (Reuters) - President Roosevelt stated at a press conference today that the United States has excellent liaison with Australia and New Zealand regarding operational planning in the Southwest Pacific. Although they have not yet established a so-called planning bureau similar to that of the United States. The Australian envoy Evatt and the New Zealand Minister to the United States Nash had requested more direct liaison with the United States regarding Pacific operational planning matters. A reporter specifically raised this question today, and the President gave the above reply. The President replied that cooperation between the United States and New Zealand began when the Dutch East Indies fell. He believes that Australia and New Zealand are satisfied with the existing organization. The President indicated that if there is a need to establish a more formal organization, such as a Pacific Operations Council in Washington, it could also be implemented.

Wellington, 24th (Reuters) - New Zealand Prime Minister Fraser recently said in a broadcast to the United States that although New Zealand is eagerly awaiting American assistance, it must rely on its own efforts to protect its future. New Zealand is determined to be a large-scale base for counterattacking Japan. The appointment of Hallett as U.S. Minister to New Zealand and MacArthur's arrival in Australia are sufficient evidence of the active attitude of the United States.

### Colonel Hirai Issues Statement

New York, 24th (Associated Press) - According to Berlin broadcasts, Japanese naval spokesman Colonel Hirai stated that Japan appears to be in a defensive position in the Southwest Pacific. The Japanese "Yomiuri Shimbun" stated that Japan is not in an invincible position and that the enemy may expand its attacks on Japan. Colonel Hirai also stated that the Japanese side has sunk more than four Allied aircraft carriers, but this is not enough to be complacent, as the enemy may reinforce with ten specially built carriers this year. After the Allies obtain this assistance, they may attempt to attack Japan from Hawaii, New Zealand, Samoa, and other locations. Hirai also severely criticized some Japanese for mistakenly believing that the unlimited treasures of Malaya and the Dutch East Indies could make Japan invincible. He said that this is a mistaken idea that must be corrected immediately, as we are not yet able to utilize them.

### "Sixth Column" Discovered Within the United States; President Warns Citizens to be Vigilant; Japanese Residents on U.S. West Coast Forced to Evacuate

Washington, 24th (Havas) - President Roosevelt met with foreign reporters at the White House yesterday and stated that there is a "sixth column" secretly operating within the country. If there were no such people distributing leaflets, the "fifth column" would have no room to exist. However, once the people become aware of their activities, the "sixth column" will also disappear. When asked what the "sixth column" is, the President replied in a clear manner, "If I were to describe the members of the 'sixth column,' I am afraid that several people in this room would be involved." As for their propaganda methods, they always proceed through private conversations and private communications, which has the same effect as directly spreading rumors. Moreover, these "sixth column" members also hold tea parties and social gatherings, distributing leaflets supplied by the "fifth column" on their behalf.

If Japanese forces capture the port, it can be used as a base to attack Australia. Otherwise, Japanese forces will be deeply concerned that the Allies will use the port as a springboard to attack Japanese-occupied areas in the South Seas. This is why the Japanese forces are willing to pay a heavy price to occupy this important stronghold.

### Soviets Deploy Troops South to Protect Mosul Oilfields; Boris Consults with German Leaders on Major Plans; Turkish-Bulgarian Relations to be Determined

Sofia, 24th (Havas) - According to reports received here today, the Soviet High Command, in order to prevent Axis forces from attacking the Caucasus via Turkey or Syria and Iraq, has deployed troops south, occupied various locations in western Iran, and the Red Army stationed west of the Diyala River is deploying to the north of Khanqeen, in order to protect the oilfields in the Mosul region.

Bulgarian Capital, 24th (Havas) - The Speaker of the National Assembly announced at a plenary session of the National Assembly today that King Boris left the country on the 22nd of this month. According to constitutional provisions, executive power is temporarily exercised by the Cabinet during the period of the King's absence.

Geneva, 24th (Havas) - A special dispatch from a Havas diplomatic correspondent states that, regarding rumors that King Boris of Bulgaria consulted with Berlin, neither the German nor Bulgarian capitals have directly confirmed this. However, general foreign observers in Sweden believe that the two heads of state definitely need to exchange views at this time. Since the outbreak of the European War, King Boris has consulted with Berlin twice before. The first time was on April 19 of last year, when he visited and consulted with Führer Hitler. The second time was on July 8 of the same year. He seemed to have earnestly explained Bulgaria's special position during these two meetings, namely, that the Bulgarian people have pro-Russian inclinations due to ethnic relations, and that Bulgaria's position on the German-Soviet war is particularly difficult. Therefore, although Bulgaria joined the Tripartite Pact on March 1, 1941, it still needs to remain outside the war. King Boris himself explained the reasons for this to Führer Hitler one by one. However, this situation has recently changed somewhat. A few weeks ago, King Boris exchanged congratulatory telegrams with Führer Hitler on the occasion of the first anniversary of Bulgaria's accession to the Tripartite Pact. This move was tantamount to formally declaring that Bulgaria was promoting Axis policies. However, the current problem lies in confirming whether Bulgaria will take further action on the eve of Germany's launch of a spring offensive. Looking back, in January of this year, German troops withdrew from the eastern occupied area of Serbia, and Bulgarian troops took over. After the end of the Balkan War last year, Bulgaria also sent troops to occupy southern Yugoslav territory without bloodshed. Regarding the former, although its occupied area has extended to 12 miles south of Belgrade, Bulgaria has no intention of annexing it. On the contrary, Bulgaria has long regarded the latter, namely southern Yugoslav territory, as its own territory, and therefore advocates that it should be allocated to Bulgaria when a peace treaty is signed. Judging from the above, it can be seen that although Bulgaria has not sent a single soldier to fight against the Soviet Union in the past, it has accepted a major task, in other words, it is replacing German troops in the rear by stationing in occupied areas, so that Germany can free up troops to go to the front lines to fight. To what extent should Bulgaria participate in future offensives, and what should be the relationship between Bulgaria and Turkey in the future? Both need to be determined quickly. It is therefore obvious that King Boris's decision to consult with Berlin for the third time and discuss major plans with Führer Hitler is to be expected.

Outlook on the European Situation

Washington, 24th (Havas) - Regarding the Axis countries' launch of a new offensive in the Middle East and Near East this spring, American military experts have divided opinions, clearly divided into two factions. One faction, considering that Germany and Italy have repeatedly concentrated army units in the area near Turkey and Syria, and that their navy and air force are stepping up activities in the Mediterranean, and that the Axis countries' diplomatic activities in this area are becoming more active, believes that Germany and Italy are preparing to march into the Middle East and Near East. This faction has a larger number of people and clearly occupies a dominant position in American public opinion. But another faction says that the German army's operations against the Soviet Union have already progressed to this point, and that the Soviet authorities have prepared a large number of fresh troops to join the front lines to cope with the spring battle. As such, the German army may not open a new battlefield. But regardless of how the German army will act in the future, the United States has always attached importance to the situation in the Near East and Middle East. The dispatch of Bullitt to the Near East and the extension of the Lend-Lease Act to Turkey are clear evidence of this. Among them, Turkey is the most important country to the United States. Recently, the German ambassador to Turkey, Papen, and the Turkish ambassador to Germany returned to their respective countries for consultations at the same time. Political circles here also believe that this is a symbol that Germany hopes that negotiations with Turkey will conclude smoothly as soon as possible.

### Bulgarian Denial of Diplomatic Conference

### Northwestern Front: Soviet Forces Attack, Recapturing Nineteen Strongholds; German Sixteenth Army Surrounded

Reuters, Moscow, 25th: The Soviet Information Bureau's noon communiqué stated that there were no major changes on the front lines on the night of March 24th. Furthermore, the Red Army's newspaper, "Red Star," reported today that a Soviet regiment operating on the Northwestern Front recaptured nineteen inhabited locations in forty days after a rapid march through snow-covered fields. A dispatch from Sevastopol in the Crimean Peninsula stated that the residents of the besieged naval base have fully entered a state of alert.

Reuters, Moscow, 24th: A dispatch from the front lines today stated that the German side is now making the most intense efforts to rescue the German Sixteenth Army, which has been surrounded by Soviet forces at Staraya Russa. The German army is conducting large-scale air raids and fiercely counter-attacking with tanks. The German army is concentrating all its forces to advance in a certain area, resulting in the most intense fighting. The German attacks have been repelled, but the German army continues to make ineffective attacks despite its heavy losses. The German side continues to transport multiple battalions of troops to provide reinforcements. The Soviet army has completely annihilated the German 290th Infantry Division. Except for its number, the division has been completely wiped out. According to another front-line report, the Soviet army has achieved even greater victories in the areas of Kalinin and south of it. The Soviet army has recaptured two cities. In another area, the German army is repeatedly retreating.

### Mediterranean Sea: Major Naval Battle between British and Italian Navies; Italian Battleship Damaged by Torpedo

Reuters, London, 24th: The British Admiralty announced today that naval battles have been taking place in the Mediterranean Sea for several days as a result of protecting shipping to Malta. On the afternoon of March 22nd, a portion of our navy under the command of Rear Admiral Vian encountered an Italian cruiser. The Italian ship's purpose was clearly to intercept and disrupt our convoy. Details of this battle have not yet been received, but it is known that the enemy ships were driven away and our ships suffered no losses. In the evening of the same day, Italian ships tried to interfere again. Based on the reliable reports received so far, it appears that we acted with the most heroic and determined spirit, attacking with torpedoes. At least one Italian ship was hit by a torpedo. After that, the enemy ships did not attempt to interfere with the convoy again, despite their all-out attacks. The enemy's claim of sinking a British warship is completely unfounded. Only one merchant ship was sunk during an air raid.

Haitong Agency, Rome, 25th: This morning, Italian newspapers published detailed reports of the major battle in the Mediterranean Sea. "Il Messaggero" pointed out that the firing began at 2:30 PM on March 20th and continued unabated until 9:15 PM, the longest naval battle in recent years. The weather was bad that day, with strong winds and waves in the afternoon, becoming even worse in the evening. Yesterday's report stated that there were eight or nine ships and six escorting destroyers. Today's report states that there were only seven ships, but eleven or twelve escorting destroyers. At the beginning of the engagement, the two sides were about 19 kilometers apart. The Italian side had three cruisers and seven destroyers. As the battle progressed, the distance narrowed to only ten kilometers. At 5:00 PM, the Italian battleship "Vittorio" arrived to join the battle. At 6:30 PM, one enemy ship (apparently a destroyer) was hit. At that time, there was a thick fog and visibility was not very clear, but many enemy destroyers were seen rushing out, firing dozens of torpedoes, and then retreating into the fog. However, none of the enemy's torpedoes hit. The "Vittorio" suffered only minor damage. Italian torpedo planes and bombers assisted in the battle.

Haitong Agency, Rome, 25th: According to the latest news, in the naval battle in the Mediterranean Sea on the 22nd and 23rd, a total of twenty warships and merchant ships were sunk and damaged. The Axis air force and the Italian navy participated in this battle, sinking two warships and two transport ships each, and damaging eleven warships and five transport ships. At the same time, the Axis air force bombed the Malta airfield, preventing British aircraft from going to rescue the British convoy. Sixteen British aircraft were lost.

### A Record of a Pilgrimage in the Indian Peninsula (Part 3)

Five miles outside the city of Jaipur is Amber, the old capital before Jai Singh. The old fortress was occupied by the Rajput people in 1037. A palace was built, overlooking the entire village. The fortress is difficult to climb, so the prince specially prepared an elephant team to safely transport us and the half-ton of mirror boxes to the top of the city. The elephant back chairs can seat three people on each side, sitting back to back. If you want to travel in the mountains with a dozen or so pieces of photographic equipment, this kind of elephant sedan chair is not very suitable and I cannot recommend it. We walked down the mountain!

Walking along the edge of the Indian desert, we continued southwest and arrived in Jodhpur, which is famous for the style of breeches that originated there. An hour away from the city, the fortress of the city can be seen in the clear desert air. We stayed with the Prince of Jodhpur for two weeks, leaving our vehicles and equipment here, and took the train north to Bikaner and south to Baroda, because the rivers there are crisscrossed and there are no bridges to pass, so we could not use cars.

The Prince of Jodhpur has been building a giant stone palace for ten years, which is now nearing completion. The palace covers several acres and the interior is very modern, with the world's greatest air conditioning equipment. We should be aware of the necessity of this equipment. The heat of the desert is very intense, and even the coolest season is very sultry. We first let him enjoy a cool pleasure, that is, invite him to our air-conditioned car for tea.

The Prince is very fond of photography and is very interested in our photographic equipment. One night, after dinner in the old palace, he showed us several kinds of films about rare and exotic animals. They were taken by the Prince with great patience. In the film, a leopard kills a mountain goat, and then prevents greedy vultures from sharing this rich lunch.

Wild Boar Hunting

The main sport in Jodhpur is boar spearing. You ride a horse, take a spear and go hunting. The Prince specially planned for us to film the hunting situation, and he and his young son participated in it. Bauer (a friend of the author who traveled with him) mounted a large color movie camera on the back of a Ford car, and Lorey (another friend of the author) presided over a still camera in another travel car.

Six guards, riding camels, protected the left and right wings. Twelve hunters followed the Prince's team to hunt wild boars. The wild boar's tusks can severely injure the legs of horses, and many hunters have been bitten to death.

Soon, we encountered a strange-looking old pig, so we began to hunt it. The wild boar was first startled and fled, scurrying around like lightning. If it fled in a straight line, the cavalry would easily catch up, but the wild boar darted back and forth, and the cavalry was not so agile. The two Indians driving the cars had to drive at a speed of 45 miles per hour to keep the speed of the prey consistent with the camera, because the car still had to turn and twist to avoid driving into dried-up waterways.

How the car was able to travel on such uneven ground was mysterious, and it was even more strange that Lorey and Bauer did not shake out of the car. Two legs of the camera tripod broke due to severe vibration, but we managed to take the pictures. A total of eight wild boars were captured.

The Prince of Jodhpur loves flying and has his own Lockhead plane, which he can drive himself. He has won the rank of Air Force Vice-Major in the British Army. The Prince specially demonstrated his flying skills to us at the Jodhpur Airport. If flying to China, the Dutch East Indies, and Australia, he will have to land here to refuel.

We wanted to leave here to go to Baroda to participate in the audience ceremony for the birthday of the Baroda monarch, so the Prince of Jodhpur specially prepared a special car for us to drive in, reducing the loneliness of the 36-hour journey.

Indian Train Although the train car we were sitting in was very gorgeous, the complexity of the Indian railway lines can be said to be unique to other places. Every time we arrived at a station, there were crowds of people, crying and shouting, day and night. Although the third-class carriages were already crowded, they still squeezed in. Vendors sold what seemed to be poisonous food in rough voices.

### Redemption of Damaged Banknotes Exceeds Ten Million Yuan; Silver Union Preparatory Committee Notifies All Banks and Firms to Limit Redemption of Large Amounts to Prevent Profiteering

After the Bank Association Preparatory Committee, in accordance with the methods of the Issuing Preparatory Committee, redeemed damaged banknotes, the trend of rejecting damaged banknotes in the market has subsided. Large banknotes of 100 yuan and 50 yuan, as well as the new versions of the Republic of China 29 and 30 years, are all universally accepted at full value. The damaged banknotes received by the committee have exceeded ten million yuan. Now, after consulting with the Money Industry United Reserve, in order to prevent speculators from taking advantage of the situation, the acceptance of large amounts of damaged banknotes is restricted. Member banks and firms have been notified to comply.

### Authorities Strictly Investigate False Registration of Food under False Pretenses

If encountering the above situation, report to the police immediately

Recently, some unscrupulous people, wearing Red Cross armbands and copper badges, have falsely claimed to be personnel from the Shanghai Municipal Council Food Bureau, falsely telling citizens that they can register their household and food supplies, and then receive food per household, claiming that the meeting place is located at the Taihe Building on Lloyd Road, thereby soliciting registration fees and defrauding money. This has been discovered by the police authorities, and it is known that many people have been deceived. The authorities are now strictly arresting unscrupulous people. If citizens encounter the above situation, they can hand them over to the police, or quickly report to the nearest police station for investigation.

### Licenses for Subletting Houses to Be Implemented on Schedule; to Be Issued Starting April 1st

The Shanghai Municipal Council's movement to curb excessive rents and eliminate tips is still new, so the preparatory work is inevitably slightly slow. Since the Shanghai Municipal Council officially announced the new appendix to the Land Regulations for Subletting Houses on January 27th of this year, and then announced the Licensing Rules for Subletting Houses on February 19th, the Shanghai Municipal Council's measures to crack down on housing speculation began to gradually show signs of progress. However, the implementation date of this measure was officially announced yesterday to be from April 1st. All subletters (i.e., second landlords) of residential houses in the Public Concession should immediately start applying to the Shanghai Municipal Council for subletting licenses. According to the Licensing Rules for Subletting Houses, the license number plate obtained should be nailed in an obvious and easily visible location on the house. The licensee should also list the exact amount of rent paid to the landlord, along with the municipal tax license fee and the water and electricity bills for the previous month, and post it next to the license. The licensee may also charge a profit of up to 20% based on the above-mentioned expenses. If there is a question or dispute as to whether the rent allocation between the sublet houses is appropriate, the Shanghai Municipal Council may initiate it on its own initiative, or decide the appropriate rent for each sublet portion when any sublet tenant submits a written request. When the licensee or the sublet tenant sublets the rented house or any part thereof, they shall not solicit or receive tips, and shall not collect more than one month's rent in advance. If there is any violation of any of these rules, the Shanghai Municipal Council may revoke or suspend the license, confiscate part or all of the deposited security deposit, and prosecute the licensee.

### Golay Carbon Paper Is Being Counterfeited

The Golay Yangxing, located at Room 524, No. 133 Yuanmingyuan Road, produces carbon paper. Due to the shortage of raw materials and reduced production, the market price has risen from a few cents per box to more than 200 yuan. As a result, some merchants are willing to violate the law and counterfeit the company's trademark, selling inferior products and making huge profits. When Golay Yangxing learned of this, it reported to the Central Police Station and requested an investigation. After investigation by Chief Detective Tang Zihong and Detective Cheng Renkun, the agencies counterfeiting the carbon paper were cracked at Pacific Books, Graphics and Stationery Co., No. 78, Lane 357, Weihaiwei Road, and Wang Baoda Box Factory, No. 19, Lane 1212, Xiaoshadu Road. The criminals Zhang Shanjiu, Zhang Yiming, Chen Yuanbiao, and Wang Jingui were arrested, and about 4,000 counterfeit trademark papers, 400 boxes, more than 10,000 carbon papers, a lead printing plate, and six rubber plates were seized and taken to the police station for investigation, pending investigation and prosecution.

### Old Steward of Firewood Shop Murdered

Zhang Dongsheng, a Ningbo native, 62 years old, was an old steward at the Fuxing firewood shop at No. 161 Glock Road in the French Concession. His son-in-law, Ye Fugeng, also worked in the shop. At 7:30 AM the day before yesterday, he got up to open the door and found that Zhang Dongsheng had been stabbed in the head and other places with a knife and had died. He immediately reported to the police station, who sent detectives to investigate. The body was taken to the coroner's office for examination. After the examination, the body was claimed by the deceased's wife, Zhang Li, for burial. The police station ordered all detectives on duty to strictly arrest the fugitive murderer and bring him to justice for prosecution.

### Daughter Sent to Fellow Villager's Home for Foster Care Sold as a Maid

Zhou Menglanlan, a woman from Changzhou, 30 years old, lives at No. 3, Shiyuli, Edward Road. She married Zhou Aru, a fellow villager. She had a daughter named Lingdi. Because the couple was not in harmony and quarreled from time to time, she went to Guangdong to visit relatives alone. She temporarily entrusted Lingdi to the family of Xie Rongji, the owner of the Shui Mu workshop (Huagneau Road Hongyunfangkou), Xie Arong and his wife. When she returned to Shanghai to visit her daughter, she was gone. When she asked Xie and his wife, they initially claimed that the house was small and she had been transferred to another place. Then they revealed the truth, saying that they had given Lingdi to the owner of a paper shop to be a child bride. In fact, Xie and his wife had sold Lingdi as a maid and could not hand her over. The mother loved her daughter deeply, so she asked lawyer Qian Yuan to accuse Xie and his wife of enticement, requesting the return of her own daughter in order to reunite the family. The investigation is currently underway, and the defendants are being arrested.

### The Industrial and Social Section Reassesses the Standard of Living: A Family of Five Needs More Than 200 Yuan a Month, Prices Rise Again, and Life Becomes Progressively Difficult

Last winter, at the request of the business community, the Industrial and Social Section of the Public Works Department re-investigated the living conditions of Chinese workers in Shanghai. They also solicited account books from families in financial straits and, after gathering and compiling the survey, have recently completed their work. The following is a summary of the section's research on the standard of living of Chinese workers in Shanghai in 1942. In recent days, however, due to currency fluctuations and renewed price increases, workers' lives have become even more difficult.

Sampling Survey

Since the start of the Sino-Japanese War, over four and a half years ago, the standard of living of Chinese workers in Shanghai has clearly changed. Items that worker families used to regularly use are now too expensive to afford. In December 1941, the Pacific situation further deteriorated, and consumer habits changed even faster before and after. It was necessary to reassess the situation. Therefore, from December 1941 to January 1942, a sampling survey was conducted. Staff from the Statistics Division of the Public Works Department Industrial and Social Section recorded detailed income and expenditure accounts for worker families, totaling 105 households, which were used as the basis for compiling a new cost-of-living index.

Distribution of Operations

The selection of families should ensure that the city's main industries are suitably represented. Among the heads of the 105 households, 10 were engaged in machinery, 4 in earth and stone, 20 in public utilities, 8 in the chemical industry, 21 in textiles, 1 in clothing, 14 in food and tobacco, 24 in paper making and printing, and 3 in other industries.

Family Size

According to this survey, the average worker family had 5.02 members, or 4.41 consumption units, which is slightly higher than the 4.62 members or 4.28 consumption units in 1929. This is because, since the outbreak of the war, family members who used to live in the interior have come to Shanghai. According to the analysis, each employed worker had to support the living expenses of two other people. At the end of this survey, many factories had closed down, and unemployment was rampant.

Income

In terms of monetary value, the average monthly income of worker families during these two months was 7.74 times higher than in 1929, increasing from 34.709 yuan to 268.706 yuan. However, the cost of living rose even faster, so the actual goods received were less. The amount of goods that money can buy is the main factor determining the standard of living. The head of the household's monthly salary accounted for 66.198% of the family income, or 177.879 yuan. The salaries of other family members accounted for 13.294%, or 35.722 yuan. Other income, such as rent from surplus rooms, profits from selling goods, severance pay, etc., accounted for 10.508%, or 55.105 yuan. The head of the household's basic salary accounted for 21.336% of the family income, or 57.3322 yuan. Allowances accounted for 40.620%, or 109.147 yuan. Profit sharing accounted for 4.182%, or 11.238 yuan.

Expenditure

In 1929, a monthly income of 37.865 yuan was sufficient to cover all family expenses. However, at the beginning of 1942, 329.864 yuan was required. During periods of rising prices, expenditures on food and housing far exceeded those on clothing and other miscellaneous items. The percentage of expenditures in these two periods is shown in the table below:

Expenditures on food and housing accounted for only 16.561% of family expenditures. According to Engel's Law of Consumption, the higher the percentage of consumption on miscellaneous items, the higher the standard of living. In 1941-42, the percentage of consumption on miscellaneous items was very small, indicating that the standard of living had declined. The average monthly expenditure on consumer goods for a family of 5.020 or 4.41 consumption units was 329.254 yuan, while expenditure on non-consumer goods was only .610 yuan.

(Note 1) Refers to debt interest, taxes, etc., which are not directly related to consumption.

(Note 11) Calculated with expenditures on consumer and non-consumer goods as 100. The same calculation method is used for other categories and items.

As can be seen from the table, rice and fuel were the most significant expenses. Rice accounted for 105.485 yuan per month, and fuel accounted for 33.433 yuan. Flour products mainly consisted of large flatbreads, fried dough sticks, and steamed buns. Education expenses were less than 4 yuan per family per month, accounting for only 1.136%.

Reassessment of the Standard of Living

Comparing the standard of living in 1942 with that of 1929, it is clear that many consumer goods were no longer affordable for workers, and the quantities of those that were affordable had also greatly decreased. However, the consumption of some items actually increased, which was to compensate for the shortages. Most of these involved replacing animal-based proteins with plant-based vegetables. In the food category, the consumption of flour, all types of noodles, meat, bean products, fats, vegetable oils, and seasonings all decreased, while the consumption of green vegetables greatly increased. The consumption of radish also increased slightly. The consumption of salt and rice increased, with the former due to increased consumption of vegetables and the latter due to the larger family size compared to 1929. The consumption of fresh fish increased slightly, while meat and eggs were rarely seen.

According to the 1929 survey, the average worker's dwelling was 32 cubic meters per room, equivalent to 1129.2 cubic feet. The dwellings of the families keeping accounts this time were all measured, and the average was 1029.07 cubic feet per room. Therefore, the standard room was set at 1000 cubic feet. In other words, the standard room had shrunk by one-tenth compared to before. In 1929, the average worker's dwelling was 1513 cubic feet per family, but by 1942, it had decreased to 1029 cubic feet, almost one-third less. Rent was expensive, so people had to rent smaller houses, resulting in increased crowding and hygiene conditions far worse than before the war. Kerosene consumption was halved, while the consumption of coal briquettes and waste wood increased slightly, as they were essential for cooking. The consumption of all types of clothing decreased, especially fine cloth and striped cloth. Native cloth was rarely seen, while Indanthrene blue cloth was very popular, more so than in the past. In the miscellaneous category, cigarette consumption decreased, while the quantity of soap and coarse paper increased slightly.

Although the head of the household's salary increased, the income of other family members decreased. The total family income was higher than in the past, but the standard of living in 1942 was greatly reduced. The monthly expenses required for the reduced standard of living can be calculated based on the prices of 54 items, while the minimum standard of living can be calculated based on the prices of 38 items.

New Index

Based on the newly obtained consumption quantities, a new index can be compiled. Compared to the one based on 1929 and repeatedly revised, it can better represent the general situation. The main goods and services required by worker families, 54 in total, have been selected, and their prices are surveyed monthly to compile the index. The standards for selecting goods are: those with the largest consumption quantity, those with the highest cost, those purchased most frequently, those purchased by the most families, and those that are essential goods. This time, the account keeping period was shorter than the last time, which lasted for a year. Therefore, the seasonal changes were given the most attention. Items that did not meet the previous standards were also included this time. The new index is based on the standard of living in December 1941 and January 1942, with the average price in 1936 as 100. The consumption quantities of some items decreased, while those of others increased. The two offset each other, with the decrease being greater than the increase. Therefore, the new total index for February 1942 was 1363.47, which is 105.46 points lower than the old index of 1468.93.

### Taiju Kee and Three Other Godowns Open Today for Rice Distribution: Six Godowns in Total Supply Rice for Rice Shops to Collect, Queuing for Retail Sales Started Yesterday, Separating Men and Women

Yesterday, the Rice and Grain Management Committee of the Public Works Department continued to designate six godowns for rice shops to distribute rice for retail sales. The issuance of transportation permits will be suspended today and will resume as usual tomorrow. As for corn, rice shops can sell it tomorrow. The following is a report from a Datong News Agency reporter:

Three New Godowns Open Today

According to a Datong News Agency reporter, the Rice and Grain Management Committee of the Public Works Department designated Huasheng Godown on Gongping Road, Dinghe Godown on Santai Road, and Shanghai (Bank) Godown on West Suzhou Road yesterday for rice shops to collect rice. In addition, three new godowns have been opened: Xiongju Kee Godown at 130 Hong Kong Road, Shunheng Godown at 722 Suzhou Road, and Changfeng Godown at 88 Museum Road, making a total of six godowns for rice shops to distribute rice today.

Corn to be Sold Out Tomorrow

The corn that rice shops in the two settlements received from 195 Suzhou Road and Tihe Godown can be completely sold out today. On the 27th, all 395 rice shops in the two settlements can sell out. The days for selling foreign rice this week will still be Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday, while corn will be sold on Friday, with a limit of half a liter per person, priced at 1.7 yuan in national currency.

Queuing and Numbering Continued from Yesterday

Since the ban on the import of domestic rice into the settlements, the crowds have been extremely congested, making it impossible for the police to organize the masses to queue and number, causing disorder. However, since yesterday, the police have dispatched more officers to force the public to queue, so the order has been greatly improved. The queuing method is to separate men and women, so women who buy rice can also get it, unlike the previous few days when they were often disappointed.

### Special Tax on Sugar and Cosmetics

### Has Not Changed

Recently, there have been rumors that the Jianghai Customs has issued a notice to levy a temporary special tax on sugar and cosmetics, which has attracted the attention of relevant merchants. It has been found that the Customs issued Announcement No. 1660 on December 31 of the 30th year of the Republic of China (1941) to implement the above-mentioned temporary special tax, which is not a recent implementation. All relevant merchants should pay taxes in accordance with the current regulations of Announcement No. 1660. In addition, the Customs issued Announcement No. 1669 yesterday regarding the filling of customs declarations in Japanese: "In the future, if it is necessary to fill in import and export declarations and other items in Japanese, this Customs may also allow their submission. This is hereby announced for the information of all merchants."

Body Abandoned in the Wilderness

His body has never been found. In addition, local wealthy businessman Chan Lin-sang, residing at 74 Yu Yuen Road, was also kidnapped on May 9 of last year at around 9 a.m. Investigations revealed that the gang leader was Lau Sai Loong, and both Fong and Chan were held in a pre-rented house at 14 Extra Smart Road. Chan Lin-sang's family eventually paid a ransom of 400,000 yuan to secure his release. Based on secret information provided by Chinese detectives Wong Ching Ying and Luk Kun Dai from the Gordon Road Police Station, the gang members, including Shui Kam Biu and Wong Chung, both from Jiangbei, and seven others, were arrested. The gang leader Lau Sai Loong

Fled Far Away

And could not be apprehended. The police filed a public prosecution for kidnapping and murder under the Criminal Law. After clear confessions were obtained, the court sentenced Shui Kam Biu, Wong Chung, Sun Chi Wing, Wong Sing Yuk, and Wong Kam Ming to life imprisonment with permanent deprivation of civil rights. Luk Wing Bing, Cheung Kwok Kam, and Cheung Ching Shan were sentenced to five months imprisonment each for carrying firearms and stolen goods. Sun Yau Bong was found not guilty. They are being held in custody pending the appeal period. The firearms and other items were confiscated.

### Low-Pressure System Has Moved Out to Sea

Since the beginning of spring, due to the lingering low-pressure system, spring rains have been continuous, making the ground muddy and causing hardship for pedestrians. According to a Datong News Agency reporter, the low-pressure system has now moved out to sea to the east, and the local climate has returned to normal. The weather has been very warm for several days, without the spring chill of the previous days. Judging by the weather observations, a period of sunny and clear weather can be expected.

Three of them were armed with guns, and another four were guarding the entrance of the lane. They swarmed inside, tied up several employees of the shop with thin lead wires, and locked them up one by one in the kitchen. They then ransacked the shop, stealing 1200 yuan in cash, two diamond rings, and two gold rings. After about half an hour, they left with their loot. The estimated loss is over 5000 yuan.

### Route 5 Tram

### Reduced to Two Cars

Without trailer cars, the Shanghai Municipal Council tram is running. After the suspension of routes 6 and 7, the current route 5 is running, so there are no plans to restore them. However, according to a Datong News Agency reporter, route 5 trams have recently been reduced from four to two, and no trailer cars are added. Only one car runs, and passengers must walk across bridges. The starting station of route 5 is still shortened to Dongxin Bridge and has not been extended to Bali Bridge in the French Concession. The trolleybuses connecting the two settlements, such as routes 17 and 18, are also not connected and turn around within their respective boundaries.

### Murder Suspect

### Dies of Illness in Prison

A Russian woman, Amy Trulikov, 33 years old, residing at 18 Laidefang, Avenue Joffre, French Concession, was murdered by a thief, Hu Wengui (22 years old, from Anhui), with a sharp knife on the night of January 17th of this year. Hu was apprehended on the spot by the shop assistant and taken to the police station. While under investigation, Hu contracted a disease and was sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment by the French police. He eventually died due to the severity of his illness. Yesterday, his body was sent to Tongrenfuyuantang for examination, awaiting identification by his family. The French police have closed the case to clear procedures.

### Dispersal of Refugees

### Officially Concluded Yesterday; 500 Orphans and Refugee Children Receiving Minimal Support; Sending Beggars Out of the Territory Has Been Postponed

After the last refugees were dispersed from Shanghai on the 23rd of this month, a very small number of those who remained in the camps were forcibly removed by the police. Support for orphans and refugee children is still being maintained. The details are as follows:

Very Few Forcibly Removed Yesterday

According to a Datong News Agency reporter, after the final extension for the dispersal of refugees housed by the Cili branch of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association Cili Lianhui on the 13th, a very small number of those who remained in the Ci Yuan shelter on North Zhejiang Road were forcibly removed by the police from the relevant Huisi police station. Therefore, the refugee problem has officially ended.

Orphans and Refugee Children Receiving Minimal Support

There are still 200 orphans who are being maintained by organizations such as the Jisheng Association, which continue to provide support. There are also more than 200 refugee children whose families are outside the camps, of whom more than 100 have been claimed by their families. The remaining 200 are being supported by other charitable organizations with corn cakes and porridge. It is hoped that the families of these unaccompanied refugee children will come and claim them.

Sending Beggars Away Temporarily Postponed

The above orphans and refugee children are currently housed in the Ci Yuan shelter on North Zhejiang Road. However, most of the thatched sheds have been sealed off. According to a Datong News Agency reporter, the issue of sending beggars from the two settlements out of the territory has been temporarily postponed after a meeting of charity organizations. It is understood that the settlement authorities are finding it difficult to carry out this matter, so they have decided to postpone it for the time being and not actively pursue it.

### "Oh, to Have a Thousand, Ten Thousand Rooms to Shelter All the Poor Children of the World and Make Them Happy!"

— Bai Min

The number of beggars in Shanghai has increased dramatically in recent years, which is an inevitable consequence of the war. Although some charitable organizations have tried their best to provide relief, it is still a case of too little to go around. In the streets and lanes, beggars can be seen in twos and threes, crying and begging for food, which is incessant. However, the ordinary people of Shanghai, who have suffered much hardship, have hearts as hard as iron; otherwise, they would surely cover their ears and be unable to bear to hear it!

Among the beggars, "little beggars" account for a large proportion. These homeless, wandering children are forced by circumstances to lose their innocence and rely on stealing and begging to survive. If they do not freeze or starve to death, they will inevitably grow up to be criminals and become social misfits, seriously affecting public security. Therefore, the education and care of refugee children is a very important part of the work of helping beggars. There are many charitable organizations in Shanghai that provide shelter for refugee children. Here are introductions to the Shanghai Ciyou Education Institute of the China Ciyou Association and the Salvation Army's Refugee Children's Shelter.

A Tour of the Ciyou Education Institute

The Shanghai Ciyou Education Institute of the China Ciyou Association is located at 1231 Route Lafayette. Since its establishment in 1928, it has sheltered thousands of orphans. On average, there are always more than 100 orphans housed there. Their lively movements and smiling faces reflect the joy of life.

The institute is spacious and clean, with classrooms, dormitories, and kitchens all well-equipped. The education and care of the orphans is given great importance. Whether boys or girls, they all cook their own food, wash their own clothes, tidy up their rooms, and do various light tasks. They must also attend classes regularly, following a strict schedule. In addition, there is plenty of time each day for the orphans to play ball or do gymnastics to develop a healthy body. For younger children, teachers tell stories and take them on outings to stimulate their minds. There are about six teachers, all young women with higher education. They have come to take on the important task of education and care with the enthusiasm to help orphans and needy children, rather than treating this work as a job.

Orphans can be adopted by suitable people as foster children. This year alone, 30 orphans from the institute have been adopted by couples who love orphans but have no children of their own. If an orphan is not adopted by the age of 15, the institute will find employment for them. After getting a job, they can still live in the institute, but a portion of their salary is given to the institute to repay their gratitude for their education and care. They can also help the institute educate other orphans. When they reach a suitable age, the institute will find good families and arrange marriages for the orphans. Therefore, the institute's photo album is filled with wedding photos, and these brides and grooms owe their happiness to the institute's care.

The institute has a large kitchen, which is specifically for girls to learn cooking. Needlework and embroidery are also required. Whenever the sun is warm, they weave and embroider in the garden, chatting and laughing. When the weather is rainy, they work indoors. In short, the cleanliness of the institute, the harmony of the atmosphere, and the liveliness and innocence of the children all evoke unlimited goodwill from visitors.

The Salvation Army Shelters Refugee Children

The Salvation Army's Refugee Children's Shelter was recently established and is attached to the Salvation Army's Beggar's Shelter at the intersection of Singapore Road and Hart Road. It shelters refugee children who wander the streets. Police officers and pedestrians bring refugee children to the shelter in an endless stream. Although it cannot accommodate all the refugee children in Shanghai, the Salvation Army has made its greatest efforts.

The youngest refugee child sheltered by the shelter so far was only one week old. The parents of this child must have been unable to support it, so they heartlessly abandoned their own flesh and blood outside the residence of a foreigner in the cold night. The next morning, the foreign couple first notified the Salvation Army by phone and then brought the abandoned baby to the shelter. The shelter, of course, took it in without hesitation. At that time, the baby was very weak. It gradually grew stronger after a beggar woman in the shelter who was about to give birth fed it with milk. Now it is as strong as a normal baby.

In the past few weeks, the shelter has taken in about 106 refugee children, including a group of 23, ranging in age from three to twelve. They were brought into the police station by pedestrians and then sent to the shelter by police officers. The backgrounds of these refugee children are very tragic. Some have lost their relatives and are all alone. Others have parents who are too poor to support them and are ordered to beg or even abandoned, leaving them destitute, unable to sustain themselves, and in a state of extreme misery. Some have hearing loss, blindness, or are weak and on the verge of death from starvation and cold. Two of them could not be saved and soon left this chaotic world. After the other refugee children entered the shelter, they were warm and fed, and received proper care. With the kindness and approachability of the staff, they were able to begin their second lives.

According to Major Walker, leader of the Salvation Army in Shanghai, the shelter does not intend to continue to educate and care for each refugee child for several years, but will seek constructive solutions to the greatest extent possible. The Children's Welfare Section of the Shanghai Municipal Council investigates each refugee child. If they are lost, they are sent back to their parents or relatives after asking for their information. If it is impossible to find their families, their names are published in newspapers to seek claimants.

Some clever and intelligent refugee children have also been adopted by wealthy families. For example, recently a wealthy gentleman and his wife visited the Salvation Army shelter and stated that they wanted to adopt a girl. With the shelter's permission, they chose a seven-year-old girl with delicate features, verified her health through a blood test, and happily took her away after filling out the agreement form. They have loved her dearly ever since, treating her as their own daughter.

### Fire on Rue Auber

At around 1:50 p.m. yesterday, a fire broke out in Dingxiangli (Lane 75), Rue Auber, French Concession. Upon learning of this, the Central Fire Brigade rushed to the scene and extinguished the fire at around 4 p.m. As a result, No. 16 in the lane was completely destroyed, the floors of No. 17 were completely burned, and the fire also affected the houses at Nos. 15 and 18, resulting in very heavy losses.

### Cough & Lung Pills Sell Well

### Public Bonds: Greater Hope for the Future

The grey market for public bonds was quite active yesterday.  A large firm offered over a million, and someone else received over a million. Buyers had greater hope for the future, buying whenever the price was low.  Sellers, wanting to exchange for other speculative goods, sold at any price, so buyers got cheap prices. For instance, the Ding type was very peaceful at first, and sellers weren't flooding the market. Later, Dakangcheng sold more and more, causing the price to fall instead of rise, while other types rose sharply. Because Dakangcheng sold Ding, Bing, and Wu types, especially Ding, about one million, but Tongkang bought forty to fifty million. Other firms like the newly listed Hongxing Hao also absorbed strongly. Xiehe and retail investors also bought a lot. Other firms like Wuhe, Shunli, Maoda, Lianhe, Lianyi, Chengkang, and Baolong also gradually increased their holdings. Although Hu Heji, Tongyi, Hongda, Yichang, Shuntai, Jiu Feng, and Zhongyi kept offering, the market was still tight for buyers. Therefore, Ding alone was cheap, but today this cheap price may no longer exist. As a result of the market price, except for Ding type which fell by 1.2 yuan, all others rose. The biggest rise was 1.1 yuan, with transactions totaling 1.89 million. A brief table is listed below. Foreign stocks stabilized, and trading decreased sharply, totaling 6,600 shares. This included 2,100 shares of Ewo Cotton Mill, with the price falling from 26.5 yuan to 25.75 yuan, and later to 26.25 yuan. 2,000 shares of Ewo Brewery fell from 6.4 yuan to 6.3 yuan, and later to 6.4 yuan. 1,000 shares of Sun-Sun Cotton Mill were at 7.5 yuan. 500 shares of Hengye were priced at 10 yuan. 500 shares of China Textile were at 11 yuan. 200 shares of British-American Tobacco rose from 10.4 yuan to 19 yuan. Langgezhi was at 14.4 yuan, only 100 shares. Other stocks that were open for trading had more demand than supply. Telephone bonds were at 73 yuan, and electricity bonds were at 75 yuan, with buyers for both.

Only China Bank at 140 yuan and Jiaotong Bank at 135 yuan increased sharply by 5 yuan among Chinese stocks. Shanghai stock was at 210 yuan, and Tianchu MSG rose from 255 yuan to 260 yuan, each rising several yuan. The rest were flat. Pudong Rayqi was at 44 yuan, with transactions, and later buyers were at 42.5 yuan. Wing On Company was at 75 yuan, Sincere was at 57 yuan, The Sun was at 28 yuan, China Underwear was at 19 yuan, New Asia (New) was at 33.5 yuan, Hong Kong Factory was at 32.5 yuan, Sino-French (New) was at 48 yuan, up 0.75 yuan. Shinyee Preference rose from 195 yuan to 200 yuan.

### Cash Fluctuations

The grey market for spot cash is still fluctuating rapidly. At the 19,000 yuan level, everyone is very firm, but because of various rumors, they dare not move lightly. There is no shortage of sellers with physical cash, but the price increase is still limited. Transactions are rare. The morning opened at 18,500 yuan, 200 yuan higher than yesterday afternoon's close, but 400 yuan lower than the afternoon off-market price. Later, a securities firm vigorously came in, and the price rose sharply, reaching a high price of 19,050 yuan at 650 yuan. Chengji, Gonghe, Xieji, Defu, and Hefu started selling, and the market price fell by 850 yuan, retreating to a low price of 18,200 yuan. Gonghe and Hongqingyong securities firms saw the low price and came in to cover, and the market gradually rose by 800 yuan, reaching the 19,000 yuan mark. The silver shop group had inconsistent entries and exits. Yimaoyong and a certain gold shop also sold. Near noon, it fell again to 18,550 yuan and then rose again to 18,700 yuan. The afternoon closed at 18,600 yuan, 300 yuan higher than yesterday afternoon's close, but 300 yuan lower than the evening price. After the close, Yimaoyong advanced to 18,900 yuan, and later to 18,700 yuan. The difference in the first half of the day was 850 yuan, and there was no change in the afternoon. Gold jewelry in silver shops was first listed as low as 1,900 yuan per tael, but quickly returned to 1,950 yuan. (Entry reduction of 200 yuan) Fine silver was listed at 20 yuan, with the black market at around 14 yuan. Silver dollars are still around 8.5 yuan.

The Shanghai branch of the Dachung Bank stated in a letter that it had read in the March 25th edition that silver shops had received registration notices, and the bullishness of the silver shop group, Dachung Bank, and gold shops had emerged, causing the price to fall. After reading this, they were very surprised. They checked and found that in addition to engaging in all legitimate commercial banking business, they never engage in speculative business. The cash emergence event published that day must have been based on false rumors. They specifically corrected this.

Foreign Currency Market: The British and American gold pounds each rose by 10 yuan. The former was 420 yuan, and the latter was 430 yuan. US dollar notes continued to rise to 25.26 yuan. Hong Kong notes also reached a high of 3.6 yuan, with large notes decreasing by a dime. Military notes were as low as 7.5 yuan, and finally 7.65 yuan.

### Japanese Yarn Supply Tight, Cotton Yarn Market Turns Higher

The yarn market initially fell and then rose, and the momentum is still strong. This is because the supply of Japanese yarn is tight. In the beginning, rumors of another increase in cotton yarn caused momentary instability of the popular sentiment for 20-count Double Horse factory single yarn at 3,300 yuan, a sharp drop of 160 yuan. Later, as buyers flocked and the market became brisk, it gradually rose to a closing price of 3,565 yuan. 42-count Blue Phoenix was at 8,550 yuan, 40-count Sunlight was at 8,100 yuan, 32-count Rainbow Ball was at 7,710 yuan, 20-count Red Kui Xing was at 4,150 yuan, 20-count Yue Qin was at 4,270 yuan, up to 4,450 yuan, 20-count Double Globe was at 4,100 yuan, 20-count Double Horse was at 4,080 to 4,270 yuan, 16-count Red Kui Xing was at 4,150 yuan to 4,280 yuan, 16-count Airplane was at 4,190 yuan, 10-count Red Double Horse was at 3,080 yuan, and 10-count Red Shiyi was at 2,750 yuan.

### Japanese Merchants Scour the Cotton Fabric Market

Factory Cloth: The market was fluctuating yesterday, falling and rising rapidly. This was due to rumors that the registration of yarn and fabric had been temporarily suspended. Therefore, after an initial sharp decline in the morning, there was an immediate rebound. As a result, the asking prices for various goods were actually higher than the previous day. The price differences were very large. Fugui fine cloth opened at 163 yuan, down 9 yuan from the previous day. In the afternoon, the closing price was raised to 175 yuan. 16-pound Flying Goose coarse cloth was 168 yuan to 178 yuan, 9-pound New Character coarse cloth was 93 yuan to 102.5 yuan, White Cat printed cloth was 130 yuan to 136 yuan, Chick Sheeting was 255 yuan to 260 yuan, Peach Girl light sheeting was 215 yuan to 220 yuan, Lunchang printed drill was 155 yuan, Zhigong was 157 yuan, Cologne silk was 125 yuan, Four Heavenly Kings bleached cloth was 230 yuan, and Changyi plain crepe was 6.2 yuan.

Eastern Cloth: The market was flat and soft in the morning because the yarn and fabric registration had been announced. However, because the asking prices were too low, there were no sellers, and foreign firms such as Abeshi continued to scour the market for actual sales. Therefore, this led to some selling turning into buying, and the rising momentum intensified, reaching new highs. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth new singles opened at 200 yuan, and the afternoon close was 212 yuan. The afternoon opened at 217 yuan, peaked at 221 yuan, and closed back at 217 yuan, remaining firmly high at 218 yuan, a rise of 17 yuan per piece. Old singles were trading at 198 yuan, and spot goods were at 195-6 yuan. Flying Fish Rainbow Ball was at 199 yuan, Yanghe was at 197 yuan, Balaba was at 196 yuan, Five Blessings Double Fish was at 195 yuan, Treasure fine twill was at 165 yuan, Five Blessings was at 170 yuan, and Four Gentlemen drill was at 6.85 yuan for October-December singles, and red new singles were at 6.65 yuan.

### Reduced Activity in Miscellaneous Grains

The trend of miscellaneous grains yesterday was still uneven. Because of the scarcity of arrivals and storage, and the scattered sales, hoarders had little intention of action. Therefore, transactions continued to be slack, and the market generally remained sluggish. The prices of beans all fell by several yuan to more than ten yuan. There were no other major changes. It was reported that 100 bags of Kaisangyuan soybeans were sold, priced at 200 yuan. One car of Liuhe green beans, priced at 190 yuan. Sixty bags of Changzhou cowhide green, priced at 198 yuan. Four hundred bags of Tianjin Jinyuan, priced at 225 yuan to 230 yuan. Fifty bags of tea beans, priced at 225 yuan to 204 yuan. Fifty bags of white red beans, priced at 180 yuan. Two hundred bags of Chongming sand red, priced at 195 yuan. Five hundred bags of sand silkworms, priced at 150 yuan to 130 yuan. Eighty bags of Wujiang picked green, priced at 200 yuan to 205 yuan. Forty bags of Jiading white silkworms, priced at 150 yuan. Thirty bags of Mingguang red grain, priced at 141 yuan. One thousand five hundred pieces of Hankou soybean cake, priced at 36.5 yuan to 38 yuan. One car of Yuanlong soybean cake, November warehouse receipt, 47 yuan. One thousand pieces of Fengji soybean cake, March new warehouse receipt, 55 yuan. Three thousand pieces of Xingji soybean cake, May warehouse receipt, 51 yuan to 52.2 yuan, and July warehouse receipt, 53.5 yuan.

### New and Old Hoarders Support Prices, Soap, Candles, and Matches Rise

The prices of daily necessities are rising without end. Original hoarders are holding out for higher prices, new hoarders are constantly increasing their holdings, and scattered rural vendors are demanding goods, so the market is firm and prices are rising across the board. For example, Gubeng soap set a new record of 367 yuan per box, Baixiangmao soap was 330 yuan, Huangxiangmao soap was 318 yuan, Sailboat wax candles were 240 yuan, Phoenix brand matches were 6,800 yuan, and Beauty brand was 7,000 yuan.

### Profits Taken, Cigarettes Plunge

The cigarette market is tired again because the price is too high, sales are weak, which triggers profit-takers to flock to sell so the price of each box of Great Britain Brand cigarettes at 10,000 yuan, continued to drop 700 yuan compared to the previous day, Old Knife brand was 9,300 yuan, Five Flowers brand was 5,900 yuan, Little Fairy brand was 6,200 yuan, Pinhai brand was 7,500 yuan, Japanese cigarettes Golden Gun brand was 3,000 yuan, Golden Building was 3,150 yuan, Red Rose was 4,250 yuan, and Quanshi Lu brand was 3,300 yuan, all showed signs of fatigue.

### Lily Buds Unprecedentedly High

Lily buds are still scarce in supply, and when the price of goods rises, there is nothing that does not rise, and no price is new, so they also follow, rising day by day. Dingzhuang vegetables rose from 580 yuan to 600 yuan, and even to 700 yuan, which can be said to be unprecedentedly high. Yesterday, ordinary goods also opened at 500 yuan, and the goods were relatively soft and had edge wind.

### Apples (3)

— Gao Jiannong

As for the European understanding, utilization, and cultivation of apples, it also began long before history. For example, those so-called "lake dwelling people" who built their residences in large lakes to avoid the harm of fierce beasts, apples were their "snacks" or "surplus," and were really the food they stored for the winter! According to European archaeologists, they have repeatedly discovered many "carbonized" apples at the sites of lake dwelling people in Switzerland, Parma in Italy, the province of Savoie, or the Lombardy Plain; This fully proves that those primitive humans already knew how to cut, dry, and store apples, just like we make apple preserves or dried apples now. If you want to prove in writing how familiar Europeans are with apples, there are too many to list! Take the first work passed down in Europe, Homer's Iliad in the eighth century BC: he mentioned the goddess Eris in the first few pages of the book, who threw a "golden apple" engraved with the words "to the fairest" at the banquet of the gods, causing a dispute among the three goddesses! In Greek mythology, there is also the story of the famous hero Hercule stealing "golden apples" in the garden of the daughters of the god of western Africa; There is also the story of the handsome boy Melanion racing with the fleet-footed girl Atalanta, relying on throwing three "golden apples" at her to win her and marry her: this can all prove that apples were one of the most familiar things to the Greeks. Moreover, at the beginning of the first century AD, the Roman naturalist Pliny had already classified apples into 22 types, and the Romans also knew how to implement grafting and artificial heat to seek the reproduction of apples, which further indicates how ancient the era of their cultivation of this plant was! In present-day Europe, except for the extremely cold northern regions, from the Caspian Sea in the east to the Atlantic Ocean in the west, there is not a country or province that is not covered with lush apple orchards: therefore, apples, which are fragrant and beautiful, are always a must-have for every meal on the European table; As for using it to make wine, make fruit preserves, or cook it into various dishes and snacks, it is not necessary to describe them in detail.

De Candolle also said: Wild apples are also distributed in the Himalayas in northwestern India, but no trace of them can be found in Siberia, Mongolia, and Japan. So, when did China have this plant? Did we cultivate it in prehistoric times, or did it become widely propagated recently? To answer this question, we should first clarify the source of the two words "apple" and what the previous name in our country was. According to the apple being an abbreviation of "Pinpo fruit", as for why people canceled the word "Po" and only call it "Ping," smart people added a grass character to indicate that it is a plant. The reason is very simple: because these two words are always easier to pronounce than three words, and the three words Pinpo fruit are really a bit awkward and not easy to read. To find another similar example, Shanghai people apply the punishment of beheading to "peanuts" and simply call them "peanuts," and northerners cut it in half and strongly call it "luosheng," which is just like the current apple. But what exactly is Pinpo fruit? What is the origin of its name? Wang Shimao of the Ming Dynasty said in Xuepu Zashu: "Huahong is also called Linqin, the "Pingpo" of the north, which is a variation of this species." Li Shizhen explained the word "Nai" in Compendium of Materia Medica: "The seal character Nai resembles the shape of a fruit hanging on a tree, and it is called "Pinpo" in Sanskrit, and the northerners also call it that now, which means it is good." It also said: "Nai and Linqin are one type and two species. The trees are all similar to qin but larger, and there are the most in the Western Regions..." Cailan Zazhi also said: "There is "Pingpo" in Yandi, although the taste is plain, there is a slight fragrance when placed next to the pillow at night, which is the so-called "Pinpo" in Buddhist books, meaning Acacia in Chinese." In summary of the above: Apples are a variant of Linqin, and the so-called "Nai" that is one type and two species with Linqin; As for the two words "Pinpo", they are the name of Nai in Indian Buddhist books. - Song monk Fayun said in the translated name set: "Pinpo, this means acacia fruit, with a red and moist color." By the time this Sanskrit name was introduced into China, it was used for a long time, and the inherent name "Nai" was turned down and replaced, and after a series of head-cutting and item-changing procedures, it became the current apple that everyone easily understands. As for the word Nai, no one wants to help it "restore" or let it sink forever and become a relic in the dictionary.

If apples are really Nai, there seems to be no record of this plant in our country before the Han Dynasty; - Zhao Gao in Shangshu has the word Nai, but it is only borrowed as Naihe's Nai. Only Liu Yu's Xijing Zaji: records Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty: "At the beginning of repairing the Shanglin Garden, the ministers and remote places each presented famous fruits and exotic trees...Nai has three: white Nai, purple Nai, and green Nai." Could this be the beginning of Nai in our country? As for the later record of battles, there are only three words in Xu Shen's Shuowen Jiezi in the Eastern Han Dynasty: "Nai, the name of the fruit." Liu Xi's Shiming already had "Nai oil, pounding Nai fruit and mixing it with the coating, drying it and developing it, shaped like oil..." and "Nai dried fruit, cutting Nai and drying it, like dried meat." Two authentic and clear words. There are too many records since the Wei and Jin Dynasties, such as Emperor Ming of Wei giving Chen Siwang a box of Dongcheng Nai at night, and the edict said: "This Nai came from Liangzhou..." and Jia Sixie's Qimin Yaoshu quoted Guo Yigong's Guangzhi: "Nai has three types: white, green, and red: Zhangye has white Nai, and Jiuquan has red Nai. The Western Regions have many Nai, and families use them as dried meat for tens and hundreds of hu, stored like dates and chestnuts." Even the origin and uses of Nai are clearly told to us, which is really an excellent historical material. Summarizing the things quoted above is: In ancient times in our country, we knew that the area of Gansu Province was the place where Nai trees were produced, and the Nai trees in our country were probably gradually imported from there; As for whether the Nai trees in the Gansu Province area were native to the area, or were they introduced from the Western Regions further west - which should include areas of Central Asia and West Asia? Because the historical records are incomplete, it is not good to be dogmatic; However, we know that in the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD, that is, the Wei and Jin Dynasties in our country, it was also the period when the famous king of the Great Yuezhi in Central Asia, Kanishka, vigorously promoted Buddhism, and a large number of Western monks poured into China; In addition, Pinpo fruit is also a Buddhist term, so isn't it very likely that the introduction of this tree into China or Gansu relied on Western monks? Moreover, Luoyang Garan Ji records: "Bao Temple has many fruit trees, and the taste of Nai is very good, ranking first in the capital." It also said. "Nai forest in front of the White Horse Temple Pagoda, the fruit weighs seven catties. The taste is very beautiful, ranking first in Zhongjing..." It can further prove that this kind of fruit, Nai, does have a very close relationship with Buddhism.

There is no need to doubt that Nai is an apple, because according to botanists' research, there are many varieties of apples; For example, U.P. Hekrick's Taxonomy of Apple Trees, published in the United States in 1925, stated that there are about 2,500 varieties of apples in the United States, and the production in Europe may be twice that: then, saying that Nai is an apple, or one of the apples, is not relevant to the main point, as long as it is admitted that there were apple trees in ancient times in our country. Moreover, even if I do not admit that Nai is an apple tree, I can also prove that real apple trees were introduced into our country in ancient times! According to what Zhang Jing of the Tang Dynasty said in Chaoye Qianzai: "During the Zhenguan period, someone in Dunqiu - southwest of Qingfeng County, Hebei Province today - picked vegetables on the Huanghe Island and got a tree seedling, as big as a finger...

### A Warning to Hoarders

— Moren

The people of Shanghai feel the hardship of life, which is already universal and very deep, but today's hardship is the cause of the past. For several years, the price of rice has risen from more than ten yuan per stone to three or four hundred yuan. Rice merchants seem to be making money, but rice merchants are only hoarding rice. Other items, such as coal balls, soap, cigarettes, and even cloth, have all risen in price. Rice merchants cannot be spared from the lash of life. Rice merchants still eat the fruit of rising prices, while others profit from hoarding A goods and are saddened by buying B goods. Calculating the statistics, how much is earned? How much is the pain? This phenomenon is like moths flying into the fire, not stopping until they burn themselves. Initially, merchants sought profit, and gradually outsiders used idle funds to hoard goods. Now, even housewives have become commercial warriors, from buying and selling foreign stocks to hoarding soap, matches, and straw matts, no matter how small, they seek profit only. But if you think back, you were still better off before entering the world, but now running around the market, you feel overwhelmed. If you always hoard goods like this, what is the purpose of each other raising prices and making money from each other, with this one gaining and that one losing? The survival of society requires the masses to maintain each other, and it is not safe to compete. Today's mother is hoarding matches, but how can she provide enough for her entire life to burn a coal stove? Today's father is hoarding cloth, but how can he make enough for his son's ten years of short jackets? Moreover, the result of such price increases is that in just three or five years, the hoarding of daily necessities will invisibly turn the products into current waste, and it will also turn the factories of production into factories that have stopped working. It seems like you are making money, but if you don't sell, how can you increase the numbers? Even if you sell, you are only hoarding one or ten items, but the prices of hundreds and thousands of items are rising. From the perspective of the entire livelihood, you earn one yuan but lose a hundred. If you happily think you are making money, I think you are directly committing suicide and indirectly killing your descendants. Today, how many people in society feel that they cannot make a living? In fact, these people have fulfilled their responsibility for the survival of the masses, because they did not hoard goods and did not exploit the lives of the masses. Do not think that today's life is difficult, but I can still have huge assets and enjoy luxury and be complacent. I firmly believe that in the future, those who do not work will not have a life. Mozi regarded self-suffering as the ultimate. We endure hardship, we should not follow the customs and drift with the tide, we should seek survival with diligence and frugality, and we should leave room for our children to live.

### In Praise of Ugliness

— He Kai

If you are in London, please visit the most interesting museum - the National Portrait Gallery. Here you can see all the important figures from all walks of life in the past four hundred years. What will amaze you is that, whether it is a great bishop, a great scholar, a politician, or a businessman, they are all uniformly ugly.

Ugliness has positive spiritual value. First, all ugly people lose the hope of easily succeeding in love. This forces them to work hard in their careers; because he can only please people with his achievements.

Moreover, ugly people are often loved even more if they have abilities. His superiors will never feel jealous of a truly ugly person; at the same time, they will never show indifference to him. A beautiful and ordinary face is often forgotten, while an unusual face is often unforgettable. (Originally written by Maurois)

Animals

### Animal Defense Weapons

— Jian Nong

Since animals that are fierce in nature and like to invade are naturally good at attacking with weapons, those with weak bodies or who love equality cannot but think of developing defensive weapons: Now, let's pick out a few of the most common ones and talk about what animals can carry with them.

Shields

The simplest, or rather, the most basic defensive weapon that nature has designed for small animals is probably the shield-like crab shell, turtle shell, and armor. The bony shield that covers these animals' bodies is sometimes so thick and hard that even knives and axes cannot damage it; the claws and teeth of mere invading animals are of course no match for it.

Armor

However, those heroes who possess shields, although they can protect a large part of their bodies, are not completely invulnerable, so turtles simply withdraw their heads when things go wrong! Now let's look at a few more exquisite suits of armor. The most solid armor worn on the body, and the one most familiar to us, is the rhinoceros. Its completely intact armor, with only a few wrinkles, closely wraps its shoulders, back, waist, abdomen, and even its legs and cheeks; moreover, the thickness of its armor plates can sometimes reach an inch, not to mention ordinary knives and swords, even bullets hitting it will not be noticed! However, the most exquisite and ideal armor structure, truly making one sigh in admiration, is that of the pangolin and the armadillo. The fish-scale-shaped or square-angled polygonal armor covering these animals' bodies is neatly organized and flexibly operated; at the slightest sign of disturbance, they roll into a ball, with only sharp, protruding points bristling outwards, leaving even fierce lions and tigers shaking their heads, sighing, and at a loss.

Fortress

Some animals, like snails, clams, various shells, mussels, or snails, can all make and often carry around an incomparably strong little house made of bone. When they encounter a powerful enemy, and sense that things are not right, they hurriedly drill into their little house and close the doors tightly. Especially various conches, their houses are not only indestructible, but some, like "bone snails" and "long-snouted snails," also erect some horizontal and diagonal spear-like defensive devices outside the house, making enemies feel thorny and dare not approach! I think this kind of weapon that makes people desire but cannot reach is somewhat like a fortress.

Thorns

In the plant kingdom, using thorns as a protective charm is such a common habit, but in the animal kingdom, it doesn't seem to be very common. As far as I can think of now, in the sea there are only clumsy sea urchins, etc., and on land there are only hedgehogs, porcupines, and a kind of spiny mouse produced in Africa. Hedgehogs are what we can usually see: their bodies are covered with steel-needle-like hard thorns, sometimes rolling around like a chestnut with a thorny shell, creating a "dog biting a hedgehog" situation, truly "nowhere to sink its teeth!" Porcupines can grow to be more than three feet long, and their bodies are covered with extremely long, black and white segmented hard thorns. According to ancient legends, they can shoot out thorny hairs to injure enemies, just like we shoot arrows. The actual situation is: when it sees an enemy, it turns its back towards the enemy, shakes its tail thorns, making them rustle, so that even the fiercest beasts hesitate to approach. Moreover, its thorny hairs can fall off: if there is really an enemy who overestimates its strength and wants to recklessly attack, then sorry, they will have to take a few arrows with them!

Science

### Germicidal Lamp

— Shi Dong

Now there is a kind of slender tubular ultraviolet lamp that can protect countless millions of people from the invasion of diseases. In restaurants, public venues, and homes, this invisible light is eliminating microorganisms that threaten health. Hospitals place these lamps in operating rooms to prevent infection and accelerate recovery, and also place them in pediatric wards to prevent the spread of diseases.

The latest use of this germicidal death ray is in air conditioning systems. Sterilizing the air in public places can prevent the spread of diseases caused by bacteria - especially lung and throat diseases. Medical experts in New York, USA, have conducted hundreds of experiments on bacteria in the air at a conference. The ultraviolet lamp installed in the duct of the air conditioner killed 99.5% of the bacteria.

The most common medium for infectious diseases is the cups used in tea rooms and restaurants. Extensive research has shown that these cups pose a significant threat to health. The result of washing these cups revealed that they were attached to extremely large and dangerous bacteria, many of which belong to microorganisms that cause severe peritonitis and lung diseases.

However, after irradiation with ultraviolet light, all the bacteria are killed within two minutes. Now many restaurants are using this new type of germicidal lamp to eliminate bacteria on cups.

### Twin Mirror

The above picture is the so-called twin mirror, which can see side and back views, and the angle between the mirrors can be moved at will, and can also be moved up and down, so it can be used whether standing or sitting. For beauty-loving ladies, this can also be said to be a small contribution.

(2) Sorrow and Joy

Fortunately, Weicheng uttered "Mom" and regained consciousness. Madam Ye Er issued her new prohibition: "From now on, whoever cries when seeing the young master, if you don't stop them, I will not speak to them." Zhen Shan chimed in from the side, "Second Aunt, I advised Brother Cheng a lot, but he wouldn't listen. When I cried with him, he cried even louder than me. I really can't help it." Then, someone came to report to Madam Ye Er, saying, "The wealthy merchant Wei Yunqing has arrived."

Wei Yunqing doesn't come often. He is from the Wei family, one mile away from Huagang and one mile away from Shide Hall. Twenty years ago, he was a kind of person between a scholar and a farmer, or to put it nicely, half-farming and half-studying. In reality, if you say he was a scholar, he hadn't read many books in total. The moment he picked up a pen, his hand would tremble, and he would eventually put it down. If you say he was a farmer, he only knew how to use those long-term laborers to work day and night like cattle and horses. He would only shout loudly at the edge of the fields with a stern face. In the past, when Weicheng's father, Ye Aitang, was alive, Wei Yunqing came to talk to Master Ye Da, Ye Aitang, for some reason. Sitting in the reception room, after saying a few words, Ye Aitang pointed to his ears and said, "These days, my hearing is not very sensitive. I can't hear what you are saying." Wei Yunqing knew that the Great Master looked down on him, so he left awkwardly. As soon as Wei Yunqing left, Ye Aitang called the long-term laborer at home to wash the chair Wei Yunqing had sat on with clear water, washing it three times, and still said, "This kind of person has a hateful face and tasteless words. If he wants to come again, you stop him for me." But people like Wei Yunqing are free from disaster and difficulty, while Master Ye Da has long been sleeping underground. In recent years, Wei Yunqing has relied on the bumper harvests in the fields. He also relied on the old village directors of the village who have already passed away, so the dogs are king in the village without tigers, and he is truly an authority in the village. (33)
