### Japanese Troops Cross the Johor Strait and Land on Singapore Island; Airplanes and Heavy Artillery Fiercely Support the Battle, Now Only Ten Miles from Singapore City

Nesan, 9th (Domei News Agency) – At 0:16 AM today, Japanese troops successfully landed on Singapore Island from the front of Nesan.

Tokyo, 9th (Domei News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial General Headquarters announced at 5:05 PM today that after Japanese troops on the north shore of the Johor Strait commenced operations against Singapore last night and this morning, they have crossed the Strait and are fiercely attacking the British "Gibraltar of the East" fortress.

Tokyo, 9th (Domei News Agency) – According to the latest news, the Japanese troops who landed on Singapore Island late last night, after occupying the Tengah Airfield in the far west of Singapore Island, have advanced to within ten miles of Singapore City. The Japanese troops occupied the Tengah Airfield at 1:30 PM today. The Japanese troops who crossed the Johor Strait and landed on the northwest of Singapore Island this morning have launched fierce attacks on the British fortresses guarding the seawall and the Seletar Naval Station on the opposite side of the Kranji Strait. Light tank units followed to assist the battle. Japanese dive bombers continuously attacked, and the Japanese artillery across the Strait also fiercely bombarded in support. The Japanese troops advancing rapidly towards the Kranji River defensive positions have reportedly broken through British artillery positions and bunkers. Other Japanese units have also quickly arrived at the front line.

Nesan, 9th (Domei News Agency) – Under the cover of a barrage of artillery fire, Japanese troops crossed the Johor Strait last midnight. The British troops on the periphery of Singapore Island have reportedly retreated. Japanese troops made contact with Singapore Island sixteen minutes after midnight. At that time, green signal flares were fired into the air, followed by red signal flares four minutes later, indicating that the enemy landing had been completed. The landing troops then attacked a high ground in a certain location. In addition, another Japanese unit also landed at another location on Singapore Island twenty-five minutes after midnight.

Nesan, 9th (Domei News Agency) – Japanese artillery has been bombarding Singapore since the morning of the 5th, with increasing intensity. Japanese aircraft also flew to bomb the island. The giant guns of the Changi Fortress in eastern Singapore have begun to bombard. Of the thirty-eight oil tanks in the Seletar district of Singapore, twenty-eight have caught fire, with flames and thick smoke soaring into the sky. It is estimated that there are about 20,000 troops stationed on Singapore Island, including the British 18th Division, the Australian 9th Division, and about 23 battalions of mixed volunteer forces.

London, 9th (Reuters) – London financiers have no information regarding the number of Japanese troops landing on Singapore. The area where the Japanese landed is undulating and has mango swamps and jackfruit orchards. It is rumored that the Japanese landed in Senikkranji and Pasir Laba, about ten miles apart.

London, 9th (Reuters) – According to news from Singapore, before dawn today, a large number of Japanese troops, under the cover of a fierce artillery barrage, crossed the narrow Johor Strait and landed on Singapore Island, attempting to break through British fortresses. British, Australian, and Indian troops are trying to prevent the Japanese from expanding their foothold, and fierce bayonet fighting is taking place along the beaches. It is believed that the Japanese troops crossed the Strait in flat-bottomed boats and landed at multiple locations. The width of the Strait is less than a mile at some locations. The artillery bombardment before the Japanese landing began at dawn yesterday and continued day and night. The British Far East Command announced today that between 10:00 PM on Sunday and 1:00 AM on Monday, Japanese troops landed on the northwest coast of Singapore Island. The forward detachments of British troops at some locations were forced to retreat, and some Japanese troops have infiltrated eastward. British troops have launched attacks against the Japanese troops, but the outcome is currently unknown. According to sources in London, the reason the Japanese chose to land on the northwest side of Singapore Island is because the Strait is the narrowest there, and the Japanese landing area is guarded by the New South Wales and Queensland units of the Australian Army. According to a Reuters correspondent in Singapore, Japanese aircraft were even more active on the northern front of Singapore this morning. Japanese mortars and heavy artillery constantly bombarded from across the Strait, apparently hoping to destroy British defenses with artillery fire, and Japanese aircraft also dropped bombs to assist the battle. Japanese artillery fire was directed at the northwest to northeast corner of Singapore Island, but there were no observation balloons. Although several air raid alarms were issued in Singapore City today, it was not bombed. Several squadrons of Japanese aircraft were seen flying very high, but they did not drop bombs near the city area, apparently busy flying to the northern part of Singapore Island to assist the battle. Before the Japanese landing, their artillery intensively and fiercely bombarded, firing countless shells, and then landed on Pulau Ubin at the eastern end of the Strait, in order to launch a main attack on the western part of Singapore Island. Although Pulau Ubin is only about half a mile from Singapore Island, there is no sign that the Japanese troops are attacking Singapore Island from that island.

Japanese Troops Adopt Infiltration Tactics

London, 9th (Havas) – The Japanese landing on Singapore Island has just been commented on by military figures here, saying that the Japanese troops are still using "infiltration" tactics, which are the same as in the Malayan campaign. Although it is still difficult to predict the direction of the Japanese attack in the future, the landing site is the furthest from the fortress's naval and military base, so it seems that the Japanese are heading straight for Singapore City, and at the same time, they are planning to cut off the naval base and the airfield. It is expected that the Japanese will continue to land in Singapore and will use fierce artillery fire as cover. According to officials here, the Japanese landed on the west coast of Singapore Island, probably because the Johor Strait is the narrowest there. As for the details of the development of the war, nothing is known here.

Continued Air Raids on Various Parts of the Dutch East Indies

Tokyo, 9th (Domei News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial General Headquarters announced at 12:20 PM today that Japanese army aircraft attacked various parts of Sumatra and Burma on the 7th and 8th of this month.

Batavia, 9th (Reuters) – The Dutch East Indies Military Headquarters announced today that Japanese aircraft attacked Batavia and its suburbs again this morning. Details are not yet known. Local Japanese activities continue south of Balikpapan in eastern Borneo. Japanese patrol teams are now advancing south, apparently intending to reach Banjarmasin by land. An airfield near Palembang in Sumatra was attacked by Japanese aircraft. Reconnaissance activities continue in northern Sumatra.

Australia Feels a Serious Threat

Sydney, 9th (Havas) – Australian Federal Minister for the Army Forde declared today that if the Japanese succeed, Australia will be under serious threat. If the Dutch East Indies can hold out for a long time, we can take the opportunity to make Australia a base for Allied operations. However, fearing that time is running out, we must step up our military preparations.

Singapore, 9th (Reuters) – Australian Commander Brigadier General Bennett told reporters at the US Divisional Headquarters this morning that we are now preparing to attack and hope to recover as much lost territory as possible. The ships used by the Japanese troops to land on the northwest coast were apparently special vessels transported from southern Malaya, not sporadic sampans gathered in the Johor Strait.

### Burmese Front: War is Quiet; Japanese Air Force Continues to be Active; Wavell Visited Burma for Inspection

Somewhere in a Japanese Base, 8th (Domei News Agency) – Japanese army aircraft launched three large-scale attacks on enemy bases in Burma today.

Rangoon, 9th (Reuters) – The Army Headquarters announced last night that the Salween River (Nu River) was quiet yesterday and there was no fighting. Japanese aircraft made a fifth night raid on the airfield north of Rangoon on Saturday night, smaller in scale than the previous ones, dropping only twelve bombs, with minor material damage but no casualties. British night fighters took off to intercept them. In addition, British aircraft patrolled the forward outposts throughout Saturday.

Saigon, 9th (Haitong) – News from Rangoon says that General Wavell has returned to visit Burma. The exact location was not specified, only that he visited the front line of Moulmein. However, Moulmein fell into the hands of the Japanese troops a week ago, so it is believed that Wavell's visit was some time ago.

Rangoon, 9th (Reuters) – The Governor of Burma broadcast last night refuting rumors, saying that we are determined to defend Rangoon. The military authorities have not taken over Rangoon, and civil administration will continue. However, the city is vulnerable to air raids, and the government's policy is that unnecessary citizens should be evacuated to safer areas. Therefore, government departments and shops that can operate outside Rangoon City should move out, which will be a concrete contribution to the war effort.

### Philippine Battle Report

Washington, 9th (Reuters) – The Department of the Army announced yesterday that Japanese artillery on the southeast coast of Manila Bay again bombarded the fortress of Corregidor Island, concentrating its fire on the Mills, Hughes, and Frank batteries for about two hours.

Japanese aircraft have been bombing continuously for the past twenty-four hours.

Washington, 9th (Reuters) – The US Department of the Army announced today that some of the Japanese concealed artillery positions along the Cavite coast, which were bombarding American port defenses in the Philippines, have been discovered by the Americans and retaliated against by American artillery batteries. Japanese dive bombers are active over the American front lines.

### The United States Trains Two Million Air Force Personnel; Secretary of the Army Stimson Formally Declares that Half of the Goal Can be Reached This Year

Washington, 8th – Secretary of the Army Stimson declared yesterday that the US plan to train two million pilots will be the world's greatest air force plan. Half of the goal can be achieved within this year. This number is almost comparable to the sum of the Nazis' one million to one million one hundred and fifty thousand and the British one million. The number of Air Force personnel is even greater than the pre-war number of Army personnel. Before the Pearl Harbor battle, Stimson had announced that the number of Air Force personnel to be trained was only 400,000, but now it has greatly increased. President Roosevelt recently issued an order authorizing the Department of the Army to mobilize more infantry divisions. Including the soldiers that Stimson had previously announced were to be slightly employed, the total number of the US Army this year will reach 3.6 million. The organizational structure of the cadres of each division has now been formed, and it can be quickly developed into a complete division. The United States has long been mobilizing outstanding reserve officers into the army and organizing reserve teams in major cities. US Chief of Staff General Marshall declared that the US West Point Military Academy will soon have a batch of naval officers graduating, and they are also excellent aircraft pilots. After graduating, US naval officers should receive three years of aviation training before formally joining the Air Force.

### The United States Considers Appointing an Ambassador to the Soviet Union; Hull and Standley are Expected

New York, 9th (Reuters) – The US government is considering appointing Secretary of State Hull as Ambassador to the Soviet Union, as the Soviet Union has sent Litvinov, a very respected diplomat of that country, as Ambassador to the United States.

Washington, 8th (Havas) – The "New York Volkszeitung" recently published that President Roosevelt, at Stalin's request, may appoint Admiral Standley, who is in his late seventies, as Ambassador to the Soviet Union, to succeed Steinhardt. Although Standley is seventy years old, he is still in good health. He served as Chief of Naval Operations in 1933. In diplomacy, he was the American representative at the London Disarmament Conference. Roosevelt attaches great importance to the selection of an ambassador to the Soviet Union, and the person must have studied both military and diplomatic issues. At the beginning of the current war, Admiral Standley advocated a tough policy towards the Axis powers, and even asked the government to declare war on the Axis powers in October 1940, or at least declare a state of emergency in order to cope with the extraordinary situation.

The Australian Army should emulate the spirit of the Allied countries of China and the Soviet Union, take responsibility, and refrain from empty talk that will mislead the country. The Japanese radio station has repeatedly reported on the actions of the Australian Army, which is very strange. The government is determined to use all its strength to stop the disclosure of confidential information.

Darwin Harbor, Australia, 8th (Havas) – An air raid alert was issued here this afternoon, lasting ninety minutes. This is the third alert since the outbreak of the Pacific War.

### The Port of Tangier Declares a State of Alert; Demonstrations by the Public Against Britain Because of Bombing; French Morocco Strengthens Security

Madrid, 9th (Haitong) – The Spanish authorities in Tangier, in view of the great anger of the people over the recent explosion of a time bomb in the luggage of a British diplomat, have declared a state of war. The purpose of this measure is to avoid disturbances.

Berlin Attaches Importance to the Bombing Case

Berlin, 9th (Haitong) – German newspapers yesterday published lengthy articles commenting on the bombing case in the luggage of British diplomats in Tangier, calling it a criminal act by Britain. The Berlin local newspaper said that the Tangier incident exposed Britain's intentions towards Spain. The Spanish government has given Britain various conveniences regarding supplies to Gibraltar, but Britain has taken the opportunity to engage in anti-Spanish propaganda in Tangier and Spanish Morocco. Regarding Reuters' claim that the explosion was caused by Axis elements, the Berlin "Monday News" said that Reuters' words can be called an admission, because no one can believe that the Germans in Tangier can move a box containing bombs from a British ship. After all, the luggage of the British diplomat containing the bomb came from a British naval tugboat.

### Goods Supply Inevitably To Decrease; Encouraging Wholesale Evacuation of All Industries; Various Groups to Collect Return-Home Permits and Be Granted All Kinds of Convenience

The Public Works Department Information Office officially announced: "Given the wartime situation, despite the various efforts of all authorities, the restriction of supplies and the shrinking of the scope of industrial activities are inevitable. Therefore, Shanghai is seeing a serious poverty problem, which is already very obvious. This bureau is extremely willing to encourage and assist private charitable organizations under its guidance, but limited by financial resources, even with the full cooperation of the Japanese authorities, it is impossible to plan any public relief undertakings. Therefore, the work of the Relief Committee established by this bureau has been temporarily suspended. Under these circumstances, it is necessary to reiterate the appeal to all relevant parties, requesting them to do their utmost to encourage and assist in the evacuation of the population, which will not only help the authorities but also benefit every citizen.

Rewarding Citizens for Leaving Shanghai and Returning to Their Hometowns

Each relevant department is now making every effort to encourage citizens to leave Shanghai and return to their hometowns. This bureau has already set up nine offices to issue return-home permits and half-price train and boat tickets. The addresses of each office are as follows:

This Bureau's Business Corps Headquarters

This Bureau's Business Corps Training Ground

Nie Zhongcheng Public School at Jingzhou Road

Public Works Department Workshop at 753 Gordon Road

Workshop at 206 Xiamen Road

Setting Up Mobile Teams to Issue Group Permits

The above-mentioned offices are also open as usual on Saturday afternoons and Sundays. In addition, this bureau has set up a mobile team, ready to go to various factories (with more than 30 workers leaving Shanghai) to issue permits. Factory owners, if their workers have been dismissed, should post a notice at the factory gate, informing workers who are willing to return to their hometowns that they can have the factory collect the permits and half-price tickets on their behalf, and then apply to the Industrial Social Affairs Department, or notify them by telephone (telephone 15349).

This bureau, with the support of various Chinese directors and fellow-provincial associations, has organized a committee and set up an office in Room 277, 3rd Floor of the Wood Bureau (telephone 14036), to handle the issuance of return-home permits and half-price tickets for entire groups. At the same time, the Japanese authorities have prepared two special ships to go directly to Ningbo, to facilitate the return of Ningbo citizens to their hometowns. In addition, personnel from the police department of this bureau will be dispatched to train stations and ship wharves to recruit citizens returning to their hometowns.

There is one point to solemnly declare, that is, individuals who need relief should not request it at this bureau's building.

Evacuation Work Gradually Intensifying

In order to actively evacuate the population, the Public Works Department specially organized the Chinese Evacuation Committee on the 6th of this month to handle the issuance of return-home permits for entire groups, and set up an office in Room 277, 3rd Floor, 180 Fuzhou Road, Public Works Department. Although it has only been a few days since its establishment, fellow-provincial associations from Ningbo, Shaoxing, seven counties, Jianghuai, Fujian, Hebei, Fenghua, and others in Shanghai, as well as the cake and steamed bun trade association, etc., have already gone to apply for permits and half-price train and boat tickets.

### A Married Man Commits Bigamy; Arrested After Wedding Completed

Zhang Guisong, a local of this city, 25 years old, originally belonged to a wealthy family. In the 28th year of the Republic, he married Shen Guiru, a woman from his hometown, and lived together at 11 Xiangkang Lane, Meibaige Road. Zhang's nature is extremely fond of wandering, and he is often seen in dance halls. In the spring of the 29th year, Zhang wandered to the Dabeiyu Dance Hall and met Yang Wu Ying, a Shanghai woman (23 years old, a top student at a certain normal girls' school). They fell in love at first sight, and from then on they went back and forth to each other, and then developed a physical relationship. They rented a house and lived together at 150 Pubei Lane, Pubei Road, and had a daughter, who soon died. However, Ms. Yang did not know that Zhang was already a married man, so she insisted that Zhang hold a wedding ceremony. Zhang also complied, and held a wedding ceremony at the Lixiang Hotel on Jiujiang Road the day before yesterday. Unexpectedly, the matter was not kept secret, and Shen Guiru found out and reported it to the Central Police Station. Chinese Detective Song Yuanshan and detective Mao Yunlong rushed to arrest him. Just as Zhang and Yang's wedding ceremony had just been completed and they were being sent to the bridal chamber, they took Zhang and Yang to the police station together. After investigation, Yang was indeed previously unaware that Zhang was already married, so she was released. Zhang was detained pending investigation.

### A Truck Crashes Violently into a Cart; Cart Driver Dies

Jiang Hanqi, a truck driver from Tongzhou, was driving a No. 23609 freight truck at 8 a.m. on the 8th when he carelessly rear-ended a No. 17462 cart driven by Liu Laiyuan, also from his hometown, near Tiantong Road and Beishan West Road, causing the cart in front to overturn immediately. The cart driver, Zhang Bing'ao, from Jiangbei, suffered severe abdominal injuries and was dying. Chinese Constable No. 1857 arrived and telegraphed the Huisi Police Station, which sent an ambulance to take the injured cart to the refugee hospital. He died at 6 p.m. The body was sent to the coroner's office. After learning of the incident, both truck drivers surrendered to the police station. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian prosecuted them for negligent homicide and detained them pending trial.

### Additional Notes on Robbery Cases

At 5:25 p.m. yesterday, two robbers broke into No. 45 Siwen Lane, Chengdu Road, Public Concession, and robbed 480 yuan in cash, fleeing without a trace.

### Money Cannot Buy It Today's Rice

In recent days, the price of domestic rice has soared rapidly. In a matter of days, it has risen by 40 to 50 yuan per dan. If it continues to rise, the 300-yuan mark will soon be approached. Otherwise, the end of the year is the time for farmers to sell rice. According to the situation in previous years, the price of rice would only fall, not rise. There are special reasons for this year's rise.

According to people, there are many reasons for the rise in rice prices these days. The price of foreign rice has risen from 4 yuan 1 jiao 3 sheng to 3 yuan 2 sheng, and even 1 yuan 6 jiao 1 sheng, which of course can affect the increase in the price of domestic rice. The recent bad weather, with continuous rain and snow, has made the delivery of rice from the suburbs difficult, which is one reason for the rise in the price of domestic rice. Because it is almost the New Year, it is rumored that the Public Works Department's foreign rice will stop selling for many days, so the general public has to buy and store it in advance. Foreign rice cannot be bought, so they have to buy domestic rice with pain. When the sales of domestic rice increase, the price will naturally rise. As for the inconvenience of transportation and the scarcity of sources, they have always been the main reasons.

Although there was still Public Works Department rice that could be bought for one sheng yesterday, there were still many people who returned empty-handed and were crowded out. As a result, the trading of domestic rice in various rice shops was booming. Bo Dao was selling for 260 yuan per stone, but it was not easy to buy. Many rice shops replied that they did not have a pass to issue rice, and some only sold glutinous rice for 23 yuan per dou, which was also a rare commodity, making people panic, thinking that food shortages were coming soon.

### A Heroic Demeanor at the End of the Road

— Zhi Cang

The environment is withering, businesses are struggling, and various companies and merchants are adrift in the wind and rain. Some, having truly exhausted all options, have already dissolved or ceased operations. Others are scaling back, struggling to survive, just to maintain the only livelihood of their employees. What the future holds? It truly makes the employees shudder.

For laborers who rely on others for their livelihood, the order for "layoffs" is more frightening than anything else. Of course, the authorities of various companies and merchants have their own unavoidable difficulties, but the hardship of those who are laid off deserves attention and sympathy. If various companies and merchants can still maintain operations, of course, there is nothing to worry about for the employees. Even if they can barely support themselves, they would not fail to take care of the employees as much as possible. Unfortunately, if they are declining day by day, and the business situation continues to deteriorate, then if they can still manage to scrape together ten or twenty percent, it might not be impossible to come up with a good way to help the employees settle their affairs. With the principle of "better to have thin gruel than no gruel at all," they can understand each other and overcome difficulties together. All "friends" under heaven travel far and wide to find ways to make a living, just to have some sustenance. In times of prosperity, employees are happy and eager, but for what? Now, being constantly trembling and cautious is too miserable.

If it truly comes to a point where there is absolutely no other way, and the "layoff" order is issued, the authorities should also understand the situation of the employees—naturally, this requires mutual understanding. However, if they are not properly laid off, the employees will truly have nowhere to turn. The employees usually barely make a living at their current standard of living. In times of crisis, it is only human nature to ask for some compensation to alleviate their suffering. If it is only enough to pay for shoes, it will inevitably lead to a situation where they cannot make ends meet, leaving no room for maneuver.

The good handling of factory arbitration and dismissal by the French Concession police, originally issuing return-home certificates as a necessary supplement to facilitate travel, is commendable. With long journeys and difficult living conditions, truly at the end of the road, staying is impossible, and leaving is difficult. "The sound of insects shatters the heart, making dreams impossible." If we want to avoid people starving on the roads, then it depends on the authorities to handle things better. The Shanghai Hebei Natives Association's notice to assist natives returning home is also a good reference. "Meeting by chance, all are travelers in a foreign land; the mountains and passes are difficult to cross, who will lament for those who have lost their way?" Since we are all emotional beings, we should give more warm and substantial sympathy.

### Innocent Bystanders Affected

— Ai Qiao

A: Hey! Now that it's the end of the year, your general store must be very busy!

B: Sigh! Don't even mention it. Originally, I could have made a good profit this year. Damn it, the store next door is a rice shop, and the rice milling people block the door all day long like a wall, who else would come to buy things?

### Stage and Screen

The opening film of the Queen's Theater, "The Elegant Woman," was previously reported in this publication. It is said that Warner also has two films scheduled to open at the Queen's next spring. One is Capra's annual masterpiece, "Meet John Doe," starring Gary Cooper and Barbara Stanwyck: the story is exceptionally novel. The other, also starring Gary Cooper, is called "Sergeant York," with the young actress Joan Leslie as the female lead.
— Duo Bao

(Editor's Note: Warner and Asia Cinema Company originally had a year-round screening contract. These two films may not be included in the contract, hence the move to the Queen's.)

The theaters performing this play attach great importance to the martial arts actors, because Shanghainese love to watch "fighting." In addition to Zhao Songqiao, Xiao Zhao Songqiao, and Wang Qichang, the Xinguang Stage has also newly hired Guo Yukun, who specializes in monkey operas. Guo is the son-in-law of Xiao Yang Yuelou, and his father-in-law has also joined the troupe. It is said that Guo and Yang will leave for Shanghai tomorrow (the 11th).

Because Wang Shaolou resigned from the Gong Stage, Wang Guiqing has been specially hired to fill the vacancy. Xiao Wang Guiqing, Xiao Xiao Wang Guiqing, etc. will naturally "father leads, son follows," and a group of little braids will be seen on the stage again.

It has been confirmed that Liu Qiong will make a guest appearance as Emperor Ming of Tang in "Yang Guifei." Tu Guangqi and Zhou will also participate in the performance as Gao Lishi and Chen Yuanli.

17. Homecoming

As soon as Xiangqi said those words, Meibao's face turned terribly pale. Her mouth had lost its power to move and she could not say anything more, she could only shake her head repeatedly at Xiangqi with a full of tears.

"Then you must be surnamed Wu!" Xiangqi could no longer control herself. She immediately jumped up from her seat, staring fixedly at Meibao's pale face without blinking.

The other four people in the room also felt something strange. Everyone stared blankly, bewildered.

Meibao did not hear Xiangqi's words clearly at all, but felt instinctively that it was a good thing, and nodded involuntarily to the speaker.

A second later, she was tightly embraced by Xiangqi. Shaohua's mother, looking extremely surprised, glanced at her son, and was about to turn around to ask the old man and the other girl who had come with Meibao, but seeing their expressions just as astonished as her own, she knew that asking them would not reveal anything.

It was not until Xiangqi and Meibao hugged each other tightly and cried for ten minutes that Jinyu remembered the words that her husband had secretly told her once, and she suddenly understood.

"Second Sister, this is a happy occasion, don't cry anymore! It's not convenient for the people in the restaurant to hear." She was the first to walk over, stroked Xiangqi's shoulder, and said softly.

But it was not until three or four more minutes had passed that Xiangqi and Meibao could finally stop crying.

"Shaohua, go to the door first and send away those nosy waiters." Jinyu ordered her nephew very competently. "Tell them there's nothing going on here, and they're not allowed to come again unless we call them!"

Shaohua, of course, happily went to do as he was told. (339)
