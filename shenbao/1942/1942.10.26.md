### British Air and Land Forces Jointly Launch Fierce Attack: Intense Battles on Egyptian Front; Unsuccessful British Landing at Mersa Matruh; Axis Air Force Base Attacked

Berlin, 25th (Haitong Agency) - According to a German military announcement today, fierce battles have erupted in the Al Alamain area following a British attack in Egypt. British forces initiated the attack with artillery barrages, followed by infantry and tank assaults across a wide front. The British Air Force is also assisting in the offensive, it is reported.

Bern, Switzerland, 24th (Havas) - After weeks of relative quiet, the Egyptian front has reignited. This is confirmed by reports from both London and Berlin today. According to Berlin sources, the British Eighth Army launched an offensive, suffering heavy casualties as its soldiers advanced into the Axis minefields. Subsequent counterattacks by German and Italian forces resulted in even greater losses. Berlin military sources also stated that repeated British attempts to land near Mersa Matruh have been repelled by Axis coastal defenses. The British Middle East Command announced in its war communique today that, "Our Eighth Army, under the cover of Allied air power, launched a major offensive against enemy positions in Egypt last night and is currently engaged in fierce fighting." Furthermore, according to the latest British reports, enemy coastal defenses near Mersa Matruh were attacked by British forces. Semi-official sources also stated that the British launched an offensive against German and Italian defense lines at 10 PM last night, but the significance of this action is difficult to assess at this time. Additionally, local newspapers carried reports from Cairo stating that the British are attempting to destroy Axis air power, not only by bombing enemy airfields near the front lines but also by attacking air bases on Crete. Airfields in the Kufra oasis of the Libyan Desert were also bombed by British aircraft.

Ankara, 25th (Haitong Agency) - A dispatch from Cairo reports that the sound of artillery fire was audible in Cairo last night after the announcement of the British Eighth Army's offensive, indicating the intensity of the fighting. The Egyptian Minister of Aviation announced yesterday that preparations for the evacuation of Cairo civilians have been completed and that evacuation can begin if necessary.

Stockholm, 25th (Haitong Agency) - A Reuters military correspondent reports that the British Eighth Army's major offensive in North Africa aims to prevent the implementation of German offensive plans. London does not deny that this offensive seeks to completely destroy the Axis position in North Africa. British military and political figures have expressed satisfaction with the launch of this offensive but recognize that the wide front makes it unwise to have excessive expectations at this time. Military experts say that the Eighth Army launched the offensive at this time out of fear that Germany, after capturing Stalingrad, would be able to transfer its air force and reinforcements to the North African theater. Therefore, the British and American forces will do their utmost to defeat the German and Italian forces commanded by General Rommel and clear the Mediterranean of enemy presence. When announcing the launch of the offensive, the British government did not specify the strength of the British and American forces. American-supplied tank units have been assisting in the fighting for some time and are expected to participate in this offensive. It is reported that the British have made meticulous preparations for this operation, and the strength of the Eighth Army has been greatly increased. The importance the British government places on this offensive can be seen in the various extraordinary measures taken beforehand. For example, South African Prime Minister Smuts' arrival in London and his unprecedented address to both houses of Parliament and national radio broadcast as the prime minister of a dominion. Smuts originally strongly believed in Churchill's theory that the North African campaign would determine the entire war situation. Therefore, the British government's emphasis on Smuts, granting him unprecedented treatment, indicates the importance attached to this North African offensive. Furthermore, Mrs. Roosevelt's arrival in London just hours before the offensive was launched is likely no coincidence.

### Final Deadline for Exchange of Old and New Currency from Next Month: Minister of Finance Zhou Issues Solemn Statement

Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency) - Minister of Finance Zhou, in order to deal with the old currency in the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, as well as in the cities of Nanjing and Shanghai, that has not yet been exchanged, has issued an important statement as follows: "The matter of reorganizing the old currency has been actively carried out in the past based on established policies and promulgated regulations. Therefore, the comprehensive exchange in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and the two cities of Nanjing and Shanghai, began on June 8 of this year, and in accordance with the measures prohibiting the use of old currency, the situation in various places was taken into account, and the use and carrying of old currency was prohibited in stages, first in (1) the two cities of Nanjing and Shanghai, (2) the rural areas of Jiangsu Province, (3) the city of Hangzhou and the two cities of Jiaxing and Zhenjiang, and (4) the first phase of rural areas in Southeast Taihu. Fortunately, with the belief of the people and the assistance of friendly nations, the promotion was smooth and gradually cleared up. However, the preservation or possession of old currency has not yet been prohibited, and there are still places within the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui where the use of old currency has not been prohibited. In order to promote the new currency and unify the currency, I, the Minister, have specifically decided that from December 1 of this year, within the entire territory of the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and the two cities of Nanjing and Shanghai, if there is any old currency that has not been exchanged, not only will its use or carrying be prohibited, but its preservation or possession will also be absolutely prohibited. If anyone is found to be privately hoarding or deliberately violating the law, they will be confiscated and punished severely. However, government orders must be obeyed, and the interests of the people must also be taken into consideration. Therefore, from November 1 to November 30 of this year, we will carry out the final exchange of new and old currency one last time, so that the people will have another opportunity to exchange their currency. All sectors of society, if they have old currency that they have preserved or possess, must exchange it as soon as possible. You must know that this is the final exchange of new and old currency, and there will be no more leniency after the deadline. Do not delay and cause yourself losses. This statement is issued solemnly."

### Medical Knowledge: The Life and Health of Working Women; Do Not Neglect Health Due to Life; Maintaining Health Increases Production

Modern women, in order to seek independence in life, must mostly leave their families to participate in productive undertakings. Although this is a very good phenomenon, the consumption of both mental and physical energy is considerable due to the combination of mental and physical exertion and various [omission]. Therefore, working women must not neglect their physical health.

Generally speaking, the trend of women competing with men in the same occupations is the current trend, but women's physical and mental strength is indeed weaker than men's due to various reasons. If they do not [omission] from overwork and wholeheartedly engage in service, they will eventually become mentally exhausted and physically weakened, falling into a bad state. Therefore, women's working lives must be in accordance with their physical condition and their employment should be based on their own abilities in order to be appropriate.

Even so, how can people who are in a state of economic depression, where the tide of unemployment is raging everywhere, prices are soaring, and life is difficult, choose their employment opportunities under this double pressure? Modern working women do not care about or talk about physical health. Most women are dragging their weakened bodies, and for the sake of life, they have to reluctantly go to work that they do not want or are not competent for. What will be the result? This goes without saying.

However, should we simply entrust everything to fate without trying to rise up, struggle, and fight against hardship? No, this is not the right path. We should try to strengthen our bodies first and establish a solid foundation. With a healthy body and full physical strength, it will not be difficult to break open the cage of hardship, and life will be improved and fulfilled as a result.

The first step to strengthening the body is to improve nutrition. Without good nutrition, how can we obtain a healthy body? And whether the nutritional status is good or bad depends on the strength of the gastrointestinal function. If the gastrointestinal tract is unhealthy, even if there is a [omission] of nutritious food, it cannot be fully digested and absorbed, and the body will naturally find it difficult to obtain its nourishing effect. Ruosu is a sacred medicine for strengthening the intestines and nourishing the stomach. Due to its excellent and complex ingredients, taking it can strengthen the gastrointestinal function, aid digestion, increase nutrition, nourish the brain and replenish blood, moisten the intestines and promote bowel movements, and nourish the mind and soothe the [omission]. It has special effects on common women's ailments such as neurasthenia, shortness of breath and chest tightness, insomnia and headache, habitual constipation, anemia, decreased appetite, poor appetite, indigestion, pregnancy edema, nausea and vomiting, postpartum disorders, poor blood quality, and irregular menstruation, and regular use of Ruosu can completely improve the constitution.

"Ruosu" is sold in pharmacies everywhere. Because the ingredients of "Ruosu" are vitamins B1...B6, powerful digestive enzymes, hormones, proteins, phosphorus, iron, calcium...etc., it is a superior medicine for women.

### British Air Ministry Announces Second Attack on Northern Italy: Genoa, Milan, and Other Places Bombed; Part of British War Plan

Lisbon, 24th (Domei News Agency) - According to reports from London, the British Air Ministry announced that on the evening of the 23rd, British aircraft flew to Genoa, Turin, and Livorno in northern Italy for a second bombing raid. The British air raid was carried out in worse weather than the first air raid on the 22nd, so they were only able to blindly drop a few bombs over the dense clouds before hastily escaping. The British lost three bombers in the operation.

Stockholm, 25th (Haitong Agency) - London officially announced last night that several British Lancaster bombers had bombed Milan.

Rome, 25th (Domei News Agency) - The Italian Supreme Command announced today that the British Air Force again attacked several locations in the Lombardy and Piedmont regions of Italy in the evening and night of yesterday. Milan, Monza, and Novara were the targets of concentrated bombing by British aircraft. Incendiary bombs in residential areas caused significant damage. Three British bombers were shot down in the skies over Milan. Furthermore, three four-engine bombers were destroyed when British aircraft attacked Genoa the night before.

Rome, 25th (Havas) - According to an official announcement, British aircraft bombed the city of Milan last night, killing 48 people and injuring 200. British aircraft also injured 67 people on the night of the 23rd of this month. As for the first bombing of the port of Genoa by British aircraft, 39 civilians were killed and 190 injured.

Bern, Switzerland, 24th (Havas) - "Lausanne Daily" recently published a dispatch from its London correspondent, stating, "The British air raids on the port of Genoa are not intended to destroy Italy's combat power in Europe, but to deal a major blow to the German and Italian forces under General Rommel in North Africa. Although the port of Genoa has various important industries, the purpose of the British bombing is not this, but rather the port facilities and coastal warehouses, because they contain a large number of goods prepared to be transported to North Africa. It can be seen from this that the British bombing of Italian cities is actually part of the British war plan in the Middle East and the eastern Mediterranean."

Rome, 24th (Havas) - Following the bombing of the port of Genoa, it has been learned that Prime Minister Mussolini has already allocated 3 million lire for relief efforts in the port. At the same time, the Industrial Federation of the province has also donated 1 million Italian lire.

### Italy Promulgates Labor Laws: Improving Workers' Lives, Increasing Government Expenditures

Rome, 24th (Havas) - It is generally believed here that the labor protection law promulgated by Prime Minister Mussolini is one of the important initiatives to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Fascist Revolution, and that the government, even in the midst of war, has not forgotten to improve the lives of workers and to implement a social policy that allows everyone to survive. Workers should also demonstrate a spirit of shared interests and gratitude in return. Minister of Corporations Cianetti recently said that the labor laws promulgated by the Prime Minister are not an interpretation of the implementation of new social policies, but only a practical action by the Fascist Party to improve the lives of workers in accordance with its planned program. The government's issuance of the "Labor Merit" special medal is to reward workers who risk danger to carry out their work. Therefore, the so-called "warriors" are not only soldiers on the front lines, but also those who risk air raids to manufacture war materials. Now, in order to standardize the treatment of workers at all levels, especially in the industrial sector, for external insurance purposes, the government has increased the social insurance capital from 87,000,000 lire to 300,000,000 lire. Agricultural groups can also receive the same treatment as industrial groups. With regard to the government's increase in workers' pensions by 25 percent, government expenditures will increase by 200 million lire. The government has decided that employers should increase their contributions by two-thirds to contribute to this. In addition, special subsidies for workers will also require 350 million lire. Factory bonuses will be distributed according to employee level, with special preference given to lower-level workers. Women workers will also receive a measured increase in wages and will be eligible for special subsidies. In total, according to this new order, special expenditures will increase by 300 million lire.

### Smuts Hints at Change in War; Germany Watches Developments in West Africa; France Expresses Determination to Defend Territory

Stockholm, 25th (Haitong Agency) - London reports via wireless that South African Prime Minister Smuts said to a newspaper representative, "I am very satisfied with the current situation, and there will undoubtedly be a major change in the war."

Bern, Switzerland, 24th (Havas) - A dispatch from the Berlin correspondent of the "Swiss Daily" states that German officials are closely watching the development of the situation in Africa. The German Foreign Ministry is particularly concerned about US Secretary of State Hull and Secretary of War Stimson's refusal to explain the reasons for the US military's landing in Liberia, West Africa. In addition, German newspapers have changed their tone regarding France's position in Africa, which they previously took a reserved attitude towards. They are paying close attention to the news that Admiral Darlan has arrived in Dakar and emphasize the importance of this trip. The "Deutsche Tageszeitung" even equates Darlan's trip with French Naval Minister Auphan's inspection of the Toulon naval port. The "Berliner Börsen-Zeitung" quoted comments from neutral countries to explain the importance of South African Prime Minister Smuts' visit to Britain and believes that this is an attempt by Britain and the United States to shift the focus of the war, or at least to do their best to do so. "Swiss Newspaper" also published a commentary, stating that General Smuts' arrival in London and the news of the US military landing in Liberia show that the Allies have intentions in Africa. However, if the African war breaks out, France will bear the brunt due to the importance of the Dakar port.

Rabat, 25th (Haitong Agency) - Admiral Darlan, Commander-in-Chief of the French Forces, arrived here by plane from Dakar on Friday, accompanied by Admiral Bard. The King of Morocco received Darlan yesterday afternoon.

Vichy, 25th (Haitong Agency) - Laval's mouthpiece, "The Word," published an editorial stating that France has never broken the armistice agreement. If Dakar is attacked a second time, it will be as illegal as all the violations of international law committed by Britain against France since 1940. The French should not retreat a single step in their colonies. "Future News" also stated that we have shed blood before, and now the colonies are under serious threat. If we are to save France's honor, we will not hesitate to shed blood a second time.

At that time, 57 gauze brokers were arrested, all handcuffed, and taken to the Central Police Station for interrogation and fingerprinting. They were warned that if they were arrested again for black market transactions, they would be prosecuted. The gauze market was suspended due to the arrest of a large number of brokers.

Warning ineffective. It has been found that the gauze market was banned by the authorities several months ago, and the gauze market has been warned several times to stop its secret activities. However, the market ignored this warning, and a large number of brokers were arrested. According to a senior official of the police department, if gauze brokers and speculators in the gauze market are arrested a second time, the police will take strong measures to deal with them. The official further explained the police action, saying that the gauze exchange in this city was officially closed five years ago, and has since been unable to engage in legitimate transactions.

Illegal organization. The brokers then formed their own organization, called the "Shanghai Gauze Brokers Association." The authorities warned them, but these people still engaged in black market transactions, and were therefore arrested. According to reports, after the brokers in the exchange on Hankou Road were arrested by the police in early September, business was suspended for a week.

Gleanings on the Opium Prohibition in the Qing Dynasty

The scourge of opium has afflicted our nation, causing great harm to the people. In the middle of the Guangxu reign, an edict was issued to prohibit opium, which was strictly enforced, especially for officials. At that time, there was a prefect of Jingzhou named Wang Zhongqi, who was also a member of the opium-smoking community. Unwilling to suffer the humiliation of being disciplined, he closed his doors and quit smoking, forcing himself to abstain. After three days of suffering, he actually escaped the sea of bitterness. Unfortunately, he was over fifty years old and his vitality had already declined. Due to the effects of opium, he died of dysentery. The Qing court praised his ambition and provided generous compensation, exceeding all honors. Those who quit smoking should first remove the accumulated toxins. If the toxins are not cleared, even if one quits the habit, one will still be restless. Currently, there is a new drug for quitting smoking called "Chlorophyll", which extracts natural toxin-inhibiting components from green evergreen leaves. When taken, the toxins are excreted in the feces, which is extremely thorough. Many people have quit opium and heroin with it, and do not feel pain or interfere with work. It is sold by the International Pharmacy Company in the Tianlun Building of the Paobujang on Nanjing Road for 20 yuan per box. The telephone number is 54078.

### How to Buy and Sell Chinese Stocks?

The purpose of buying stocks is to invest, which is to protect funds and make profits. However, there are currently one or two hundred kinds of Chinese stocks, and it is not easy for investors to distinguish them. Therefore, choosing Chinese stocks requires studying the content of each stock and knowing the trends of various companies and factories, as well as news of dividend payments and capital increases. For example, cultural stocks have recently risen sharply. Is this artificial or natural? If you can know the content of each stock and the current state of the publishing industry, you can decide on a buying and selling strategy. "Chinese Stock Research Weekly" is a publication dedicated to studying the content of Chinese stocks and reporting news of manufacturers. Investors who can get a copy will definitely benefit greatly. The third issue will be published today.

### Revaluation of Houses in the Public Concession is Underway; To Achieve a Fair Standard for Adjusting Rents; Leased Houses with Contracts are Not Affected

Regarding the issue of house rents in the Public Concession, Mr. Okazaki, the Director-General of the Public Works Department, previously stated that a solution will be obtained in the near future, which is to revalue the houses and then adjust the rents.

Work results to be announced soon.

It is learned that the work of revaluing house prices is currently being carried out by relevant personnel in cooperation, and it is expected to be announced soon. It is learned that the principles of adjusting rents are nothing more than the following points: (1) The Public Works Department will not convert the old legal tender into Central Reserve Coupons at a consistent rate, because the rent situation is extremely complicated. If a fixed rate is adopted, it will be unfair in practice. Therefore, to resolve rent disputes, the houses must be revalued to obtain a fair and unbiased rent level.

Lane houses valued higher.

(2) The valuation of general lane houses is slightly higher than that of other types of houses in terms of rate, because in the past, the rents of lane houses were extremely low. Since 1937, the rents of these houses have not increased by more than 10%. (3) Once the revaluation is completed, the rents of offices, apartments, and residences will be adjusted uniformly, regardless of whether the house is used by the owner or rented out. The valuation standards are completely consistent. (4) The Public Works Department's revaluation of houses is only for landlords or property owners and tenants to use as a reference, and does not force them to accept it. However, the Public Works Department hopes that real estate companies, management offices, and private landlords will accept this revised valuation as a standard for revising rents. (5) For leased houses with contracts, even if the rent is too high or too low according to the Public Works Department's estimate, neither party may breach the contract. As for the new valuation of real estate to be announced in the future, it will be implemented from the date of announcement.

### Chongde Association Provides Western Medical Treatment

In view of the difficult living conditions and the inability of poor people to afford medical treatment once they are infected with diseases, the China Chongde Association has established a Western medical clinic at the Association's address at No. 2 Hou Li, next to the Baolong Hospital on Baker Road, to provide services to the poor and sick every day from 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM. Dr. Mi Yuxi, a German doctor, has been hired to preside over medical affairs. Medicines can also be given to the extremely poor. The association's original Chinese medicine clinic and dispensary is still open for consultation as usual every day from 9:00 AM to 3:00 PM, which is truly good news for the poor and sick.

### A Glimpse of the Mohaitang Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition

In turbulent times, calligraphy and painting are most easily lost, but it can also be said to be the only opportunity for collectors. Zhuangzi said: "When a man loses his bow, another man gets it." As long as it is not destroyed by fire, calligraphy and painting are still calligraphy and painting. The so-called gain and loss is just a change of owner. But collecting is one thing, and appraising is another. Spending a huge price does not necessarily mean buying a masterpiece.

Calligraphy and painting masterpieces are rare, and large pieces are even rarer. The Mohai collection mostly consists of large scrolls, with many works by Wen Zhengming, Wang Shigu, Qian Bonian, Wu Shixian, Wu Yushan, He Zizhen, and Yi Tingzhou from the Ming and Qing dynasties. Recent works include those by Wu Changshuo, Wang Yiting, and Wu Daiqiu. Some artists are represented by a dozen or so works, and others by several.

Wen Zhengming's "Heshan Map" and "Wanhe Songfeng" are both silk scrolls and can be called masterpieces. The reputation of Ming calligraphers is slightly equivalent, but their styles are quite different. Wen's brushwork is elegant and vigorous, and his layout is bright and open. His inscriptions are unmatched by others. Ren Bonian's figure and flower paintings total nine pieces. Ren's use of brushstrokes for "opening the face" and "clothing wrinkles" in figure paintings is light and agile, with a unique touch. Among them, "Returning Calf under Pine" is a fine piece. Ni Jugeng is also known for his paintings of figures, and his skills are also extraordinary. Wu Shixian deliberately imitated Mi, but his splashed ink landscape did not follow its rules and was heavy and turbid. Wang Shigu's "Autumn Mountain Cottage" is a landscape painting by Dong Qichang, more than five feet long, and is a masterpiece. The poem inscribed on it reads: "The light of the water and the atmosphere of the mist are bright on the table. The shadow of the pine and the bamboo reflects on the window. Burning incense and painting in spring, there is nothing to do, I want to form a quiet relationship with poetry and books." Wu Yushan was contemporary with the Four Wangs, but his reputation was not as high. Those in the know feel that he has been wronged. His "Cold Forest Xiaosi Map" is excellent in both brushwork and coloring, but it is a pity that it is a small piece, which cannot show its grandeur.

Among modern people, there are many works by Wu Changshuo. Frankly speaking, this old man's talent and brush power are rare. His rough and bold spirit is unrestrained and vigorous, but he is afraid of going too far. How can Ba Da and Shitao not be rough and bold, but their roughness and boldness are full of elegance, which is where Can Lao is inferior. His two green and green landscapes by Lin Qinan were made in his later years.

There are many fine pieces in the book department. Yi Tingzhou's official script couplet is concise and completely ancient. He Zizhen's true script couplet is eight feet long, and the brush is full of ink, which cannot be viewed through. Zheng Gukou's eight-part hall is called Wei Wu Jieshi, and the characters are as big as bowls, with complete spirit and feet, and it is extremely precious.

Kang Youwei's vertical axis, writes a seven-character quatrain; "Also traveling to heaven and earth, now playing in the world, the suffering of the people is unbearable to leave, and still living with wood and stone is stubbornly a unique font.

There is only one day left for the exhibition, and those who love to appreciate calligraphy and painting are worth taking the time to visit.

### Round-Gate Ball Match: Nanyang Wins, 5 to 3 Against Xiqing

The first act of the Sino-Western round-gate ball match took place yesterday at 3 PM at the Guangxia Middle School field on Moore Road. Nanyang played against Xiqing, and the audience greatly enjoyed this novel ball game. The referees were Wu Zibin, Zhang Juefei, and Di Xianzhang. Nanyang charged forward with the same vigor as in the past. Although Xiqing lost to Nanyang by a score of five to three, they managed to control the overall situation in the first half, making it difficult for Nanyang to perform. This led to one-on-one confrontations. Nanyang started the game, launching an all-out attack. Xiqing's defense was solid. In less than three minutes, Xiqing's defense failed to respond in time, and the ball was successfully passed, giving Nanyang an opportunity. Wang Yuren dribbled alone into the penalty area. Xiqing's defense was too late, and the ball entered the net, opening the scoring. Around the thirteenth minute, Xiqing's Foonick Lai Ti, with great strength, went straight into the heart of the defense. Qu Xizong tried his best to save it, but ultimately failed, making it one to one. The first half ended in a draw. In the second half, Nanyang adopted a defensive strategy. Before long, Qu Xilin scored a goal. Xiqing, after a long battle, became exhausted and unable to save the situation. In the seventh minute, Li Yao scored a goal, and Fan Qingxian also easily scored. Xiqing struggled to recover. Around the tenth minute, Qu Xilin scored again, making it five to one, putting Nanyang in a completely dominant position. Xiqing's Smith and Auchai Liao seized the opportunity to attack. Smith scored with a low shot. In less than two minutes, Foonick added icing to the cake, pulling back a goal, making it five to three. Unfortunately, they had conceded too many points and were unable to recover. Time ran out, and Nanyang decisively defeated Xiqing by a score of five to three.

Weekly Market Commentary

### Research on the Trend of New Drug Stocks

— Minute Analysis

— One of the Trends in Chinese Stocks —

Last week, Chinese stocks showed strength, especially new drug stocks. They initially rose and then remained firm. The revised Sixteen Chinese Stock Index compiled by the China Economic Research Institute was set to 100% in June of this year, reaching 134 points in the previous week. However, new drug stocks were only around 100%. Last week, all stocks continued to rise sharply, and the sudden rise of new drug stocks was a phenomenon that was expected after a long period of stagnation.

Stock investment offers two types of benefits: dividend income and market price gains. However, one cannot have both. If one does not sell, one can receive dividends but cannot gain from price differences. To gain from price differences, one must sell, thus forfeiting dividends. Therefore, the former is a long-term investment, suitable for stocks with stable prices, while the latter is a short-term investment, suitable for stocks with fluctuating prices. It is not inappropriate to call this the rule of stock investment.

Currently, there are over twenty types of new drug stocks traded on the market, with the main ones being Wuzhou and eight others. In the past two years, Sino-British stocks have had the best actual dividend payout ratio to par value. However, if considering the combined dividend yield relative to market price, then Sino-Western is the best, as its market price was below par value at the time. A comparative table is provided below:

In the past two years, Sino-British stocks had particularly high dividend yields, causing their stock prices to soar. Purchasing stocks at high prices resulted in a significantly reduced yield compared to the dividend received. Sino-Western's dividends were average, but its market price was below 50% of par value last year, resulting in a combined yield of over 26%, which then triggered a sharp increase in its market price. In essence, if the company's fundamentals remain unchanged, a high dividend yield relative to market price indicates that the market price has not yet fully reflected the value. Conversely, it does not. This can also be considered a rule of stock investment.

The table above shows the records for the past two years. Currently, all stock prices have soared, vastly different from before. The combined difference between par value and interest ranges from a small 10 points to as high as 80 or 90 points. This seems unreasonable but has become a common phenomenon, not only in new drug stocks but also in other types of stocks, such as textile stocks, where it is even more pronounced. If comparing the current market price with the June market price after the drastic currency changes this year, there are still discrepancies, which may be the basis for those who are buying low. This is the reason for last week's trend.

Current Market Price vs. Combined Interest of Par Value and June Average Price

### Market Dynamics

Chinese Stocks Surge

The trend of Chinese stocks is surging non-stop. According to the revised Sixteen Chinese Stock Index compiled by the China Economic Research Institute, it has reached 134 points compared to June of this year. Comparing week-over-week, the previous week seemed to have recovered the boom of June and July of this year.

(Note) Index Table Compiled by the China Economic Research Institute

The first column in the table above shows the overall stock price for each period, indicating the changes relative to the average price in June. In other words, except for the sharp decline in the first week of June due to currency changes, it then surged. A headwind started in late July. After September, it gradually improved. As for the previous week, it created an unprecedented record.

The second column in the table above shows the stock market trend for each week, comparing the market price with the previous week. From this, one can see how the trend fluctuates, which is different from comparing each week's market price to the fixed standard of the average price in June in the first column. According to this column, the second week of June can be considered a period of rapid increase. Although it continued upward afterwards, the increase was only between 3% and 7%. There were also weekly declines between July and August. After September, it entered a favorable situation. In early October, the market was temporarily stagnant. In the third week, the upward trend resumed.

Last week, all stocks showed a clear upward trend. New drug and cultural industry stocks were the most popular. The demand for tonics during the winter season led to brisk sales of patent medicines. Various rumors emerged in the cultural sector. These are all reasons for excitement. In general, the lag in new drug stocks was more significant. The momentum of the cultural stocks has been strong and lasting. The follow-up will depend on the outcome of the rumors.

(Note) Compiled by the China Economic Research Institute. × is calculated from the average price of the previous week on Saturday of last week.

New stocks have a small price base. Generally speaking, it is known that they have the most potential. Therefore, they attract the most attention. However, according to the Company Law, shares cannot be transferred within one year of operation unless approved and registered by the government. Have investors paid attention to this for various new stocks listed today? If "today's business is finished today," that's fine. But for the entire stock market's future, isn't it something to be happy about?

Government Bonds with Minor Fluctuations

In the bond market last week, after reaching a high record at the beginning of the week, profit-taking bulls seized the opportunity to close out, resulting in a sudden reversal on Thursday and Friday. However, except for Ding and Wu bonds, all bonds are based on entering the 60-yuan mark, giving a deep impression. The sharp rebound on Saturday was well-founded.

After this episode, the adjustment we anticipated became more realistic. The difference between the highest and lowest prices for A, B, and C bonds throughout the week decreased from more than two yuan to just over one yuan. Although this may not be fully reflected in the same period, it shows the changing trends of each bond. Who can grasp this middle ground will probably be the leader in the future.

Comparing the market conditions of each bond at the end of last week and the end of the previous week, the most significant changes were in A and C bonds, while the rest were nearly balanced. Moreover, except for C bonds, the low price of the previous week was also the high price of last week. This situation occurred after the drastic changes on Thursday and Friday, which is something to pay attention to.

This publication previously reported that securities firms in the city had telegraphed Ning to request maintaining bond prices, as well as the rumored 20% limit on price reductions. So far, there has been no follow-up or any indication, which gives people even more confidence.

Yarn, Cloth, and Woolen Fabric

Last week, the trend of yarn and cloth was on "horseback," reportedly related to the purchase and allocation of raw cotton. If the horse continues to run, the future will depend on off-market actions.

Regarding piece goods, the relevant authorities, following the price limit on woolen fabrics, implemented a fixed retail price for piece goods. This puts pressure on the piece goods market, so it was not affected by the wild run of the horse.

The announced maximum retail prices for cotton cloth are as follows (in stored currency yuan per yard):

16-pound coarse cloth 5.30

15.5-pound coarse cloth 4.90

14-pound coarse cloth 4.65

13-pound coarse cloth 4.40

11-pound coarse cloth 4.00

9-pound coarse cloth 3.45

8.5-pound coarse cloth 3.02

12-pound coarse cloth 4.65

11.5-pound fine cloth 4.25

11-pound fine cloth 4.00

12-pound plain weave 4.65

11.5-pound plain weave 4.25

16-pound plain weave 5.45

9.5-pound Yin Dan Shi Lin 7.30

9.25-pound Shi Lin 5.65

9.5-pound thin blue Shi Lin 6.50

9.25 purple sun fine cloth 6.65

9.25 fine cloth 6.10

9.5-pound An An blue cloth 6.00

10-pound black fine cloth 5.20

7.5-pound black coarse cloth 8.10

7.5-pound blue coarse cloth 6.80

### A Question

— Shen Changming

Mr. Fan Keling, the former Director-General of the Public Works Department, had a dispute over the use of a one-yuan broken banknote on a public vehicle, resulting in his being taken to the McLan police station. Mr. Fan Keling therefore sued the French Tram Company in the French Consular Court for obstructing freedom. This matter has attracted the attention of all citizens due to Mr. Fan Keling's identity and the special circumstances of the case. We have not yet heard the outcome of this case. However, according to the English "Times" news translated by various newspapers, Feiboer, the head of the French police department, has ordered all his subordinates that in the future, when foreigners have disputes with ticket sellers on public vehicles, they only need to ask for their identification and copy the number of their armband, without having to take them to the police station. This can also be said to be an important side effect of this case.

It is, of course, illegal to take a citizen to the police station without a charge or an arrest warrant. Therefore, we agree with Mr. Feiboer's order. But here, we still have a question, because Mr. Feiboer's order only mentions "foreigners." It does not clearly state whether the majority of Chinese passengers "other than foreigners" are also subject to this order. I guess that ordinary Chinese passengers probably will not be arbitrarily arrested simply because they are not "foreigners."

Mr. Fan Keling is the former Director-General of the Public Works Department. Fan Keling is British. Fan Keling is a foreigner, but Fan Keling is also a passenger on a public vehicle. Mr. Fan Keling's lawsuit was filed as an ordinary passenger, not as a "foreigner," "British," or "Director-General of the Public Works Department." Therefore, we hope that the results of this case will be universally applied to all passengers, not just foreigners, because we feel that the era of "Chinese and dogs" has passed, and all racial discrimination should be eliminated!

### Payment Cleared

— Mutuo

Once, I went to attend the wedding of a colleague. I was already late when I left the house, and then I met an old friend on the way. After shaking hands and chatting for a while, I looked at the time on my watch and realized that it was almost an hour past the time on the invitation. I thought to myself that something was wrong and ran all the way into the auditorium. I saw that the guests were all seated, but there was no sign of the bride and groom. At that time, I also lamented the bad habit of not being punctual, which was still retained in this enlightened group. Unexpectedly, another hour passed after I sat down, and there was still no sign of the ceremony being held. I couldn't help but feel confused. I looked back and saw people whispering in the corner on the right. I recognized Lao Liu and Xiao Fang, so I ran over and patted Lao Liu on the shoulder:

"What's wrong? Are the bride and groom arriving late?"

"It's a long story."

Lao Liu pointed to a seat on his right and asked me to sit down. Then I heard a story.

It turned out that the bride, whom the guests were eagerly waiting for, was being detained by her father. The groom was in the middle of negotiations with his father-in-law about this matter. Of course, the father-in-law had painstakingly raised a daughter, so would he willingly send her to someone for nothing? If he didn't ask for a sum of money, wouldn't he be too disadvantaged in raising his daughter? However, doing business requires seizing opportunities, like a woolen sweater that costs 50 yuan in the summer but must sell for 100 yuan in the winter. It's best if the customer is anxious to leave and can't leave without taking the sweater with them—so he applied business acumen to "selling" his daughter. All the betrothal gifts and jewelry had already been knocked out. On the auspicious day, when the wedding candles were shining, he issued an order to his daughter to "wait a moment before leaving, your father has his reasons." Sure enough, the groom arrived sweating profusely, and the two sides began negotiations, reducing the price from 5,000 yuan to 2,000 yuan, which was considered the father-in-law's "great kindness."

It wasn't until 5:15 (the auditorium was rented from 3:00 to 5:30) that the buyer's payment was cleared, and the seller's goods were handed over. You see, the bride slowly entered to the sound of music, and she was quite sweet-looking. I often paid attention to her facial expressions. As the central figure in a comedy, I don't know whether she was happy or sad. I don't know what the marriage officiant was saying, but I saw the bride and groom going up one after another and stamping a seal that, in my opinion, should be interpreted as "payment cleared, no regrets." The wedding was then completed.

Readers may suspect that I have exaggerated, but this is all true. If I hadn't witnessed this comedy, I wouldn't have believed that such ugly buying and selling marriages still exist in society. However, according to Lao Liu, such strange phenomena are not uncommon in Shanghai. What's strange is that I've seen so little of it.

I said goodbye and stepped onto the road. The cool autumn wind made me feel a little cold. Thinking that I was still a bachelor and would inevitably encounter the difficulty of being extorted by a father-in-law in the future, I couldn't help but feel a little worried.

### Revival of Ancient Arctic Organisms

— Shi Kuntang

The frozen regions of the Arctic may soon become the site of rare experiments. The possibility of reviving creatures that have been "sleeping" for thousands of years is becoming a reality.

Frogs that have been "sleeping" under mounds of earth for centuries have been found to be in a state of suspended animation. When excavated, they were completely revived, leaping and hopping about as if nothing had happened.

A small animal called "Rotifera," which lives in stagnant clear water, shrinks when the pond dries up, becoming as small as one-quarter of its original size when it lacks moisture. They appear to be beyond salvation, but they immediately revive if placed back in water.

In the Arctic, we can find many eggs laid by animals that became extinct centuries ago. According to scientists, if these eggs were hatched, many strange animals and giant insects would likely emerge. An American science magazine once published a shocking piece of news: a scientist specializing in the revival of organisms once incubated an unknown egg using artificial methods, and the result was a dragonfly with a wingspan of 23 inches, which startled him and made him exclaim in amazement.

Huanglong drank his wine and said, "It couldn't be better. Oh, Second Aunt, Sister Cuizhen, I say you are deliberately trying to harm me." When Second Madam Ye heard Huanglong say such things, she suspected he was drunk. Cuizhen also opened her mouth, waiting for Huanglong to be more explicit. Sure enough, Huanglong continued, "How are you harming me? You treat me with such good wine and food. My mouth is full of oil, my stomach is stuffed. If you don't want me to live here tomorrow, where will I go to find good things to eat?" Before they finished speaking, Weicheng, Second Madam Ye, and Cuizhen all laughed, and even the magpie, He Ma, laughed. Weicheng said, "Brother Long is deliberately trying to shock us, he deserves a cup of punishment." Huanglong said, "I deserve it, I deserve it." He immediately drank a cup and then asked, "Does Second Aunt want to punish me? You should also punish me." He drank another cup. Then he asked, "Does Sister Cuizhen want to punish me? You should also punish me." He drank another cup. Everyone in the room only saw him drinking and only heard him talking. He drank wine and talked, talked and drank wine, feeling more and more that he was both funny and adorable. Second Madam Ye urged him to eat hot dishes, and he said, "How could I not eat? If I don't eat, I wouldn't be Huanglong."

This dinner did indeed make them feel less cold despite the encroaching cold air. Second Madam Ye told the magpie, He Ma, to go and eat first and then said with a smile when they weren't serving nearby, "Huanglong, we're thinking of something, do you agree?" Huanglong had just put a square piece of preserved meat into his mouth. He quickly chewed, nodded, and raised his hand, saying, "Agree...agree...agree." Second Madam Ye pointed and said, "As you know, Cuizhen is originally our old relative. She's good at her work, and she has a good temper. I'm thinking of making her our family's daughter-in-law. What do you think?" When Second Madam Ye said this, Cuizhen's face involuntarily drooped. Weicheng still maintained his original state, but Huanglong swallowed the piece of meat, raised his wine cup, and said, "This should be wedding wine. I'm the first one to drink Brother Cheng's wedding wine. Sister Cuizhen, watch me drink wedding wine." Cuizhen raised her face, and a few strands of hair hanging over her forehead fluttered before she lowered her face and said, "Second Aunt, I don't want to." (222)

### Double-Layer Steel Helmet

— Wang Lian

Soldiers' steel helmets have undergone significant improvements and advances in this war. That is, adding another steel helmet inside the existing one. In this way, although the burden on the head is slightly heavier, the expert design prevents the problem of being top-heavy and affecting actions in war. But the protection of the safety of soldiers is added a layer, especially the eyes and the back of the neck. Its greatest advantage is that even if a bullet penetrates the first steel helmet, it must be deflected, and it will never penetrate the second one. The soldiers in the tanks fill a kind of object between the two steel helmets to increase the protection

(5) Striving for the Art of Drama

Among all entertainment departments, the knowledge level of drama actors can be said to be the highest. Because it has not been long since drama actors evolved from amateur to professional, most of them are still students and intellectuals. Generally speaking, a junior high school degree is almost the minimum level for each actor. There are many others, such as university students, university graduates with bachelor's degrees, master's degrees and doctorates from foreign countries, as well as university lecturers and professors. Some of them may be for fame or money, but the absolute majority of people's purpose is for interest, a pure interest in love. Due to the level of education and the motivation of interest, their private lives are much more cautious, and there is rarely the kind of practice among actors of creating "love affairs" with the audience. Some groups practice physical fitness early in the morning, and some do classical dance every other morning. These all express their desire to improve. Precisely because they know that the success of Chinese drama depends on their efforts, pioneers must suffer. Drama troupes still have a short lifespan: closing in March and shutting down in February. Actors often eat their fill for three months and then have to starve for a month waiting for a new troupe to be established. But although it is hard, they still grit their teeth and work hard for this comprehensive art because they all have an ideal.

In their ideal theater, the audience is completely seated before the opening, waiting silently for the opening. The opening is the first-class world masterpiece. At that time, the Chinese stage has become the capital of world art, and Chinese acting has become a brilliant theoretical system. Actors can spend nine years arranging a play, with work and rest. At that time, there will be no more shortage of scripts, no more economic problems, no more commercial bosses, and no more big stars who put on airs. Everything is for art, and art is for everything. At that time, the actors will be so happy to work and work in this ideal theater. Although this is an ideal, we believe it will definitely come! (End of the full text)
