### German Troops Deep into the Caucasus, Fierce Mountain Warfare Begins, Cossack Soldiers Display Power with Natural Defenses, Little Change in the Battle of Stalingrad

Lisbon, 31st, Allied News Agency - German troops advancing on the port of Novorossiysk are continuing to advance and have crossed the steep mountains of the western Caucasus, more than 1,000 meters from the coast, seizing several important strongholds. They are engaging in fierce mountain warfare with the Cossack cavalry regiments. It is said that the Soviet cavalry is putting up fierce resistance using natural strategic points. At the same time, German troops advancing southeast towards the Grozny oil field area are engaged in fierce fighting with Soviet troops on the banks of the Terek River in the North Ossetian Autonomous Republic. However, due to the difficult terrain, both armies are finding it difficult to maneuver freely.

Lisbon, 31st, Allied News Agency - German troops south of Stalingrad, after breaking through strong Soviet defenses, have approached a point 25 kilometers south of the city. Apart from intense fighting around Krasnoarmeysk, there have been no major changes on other fronts in the city in the past two days. The German army is still repeatedly launching fierce attacks with fresh troops, while the Soviet army is continuously transporting naval infantry regiments and peasant volunteer soldiers to the front lines in an attempt to block the German offensive. Workers in various factories in the city, without removing their work clothes after finishing their shifts, are immediately mobilized to go out into the city, busily engaged in the construction of tank trenches, bunkers, and laying mines. According to another report, in order to restrain the heavy pressure from the German army south of the city, the Soviet army is attempting an encirclement operation against the German left flank in the area of Kalach-na-Donu. It is said that at present, both armies are engaged in a seesaw battle on the high ground along the Volga River. In other areas, the German army is continuously concentrating hundreds of thousands of reserve troops and thousands of tanks and aircraft towards the rear of the front lines.

Moscow, 31st, Havas News Agency - The Soviet official statement issued recently stated that there have been no significant changes on any front in the past 24 hours. Northwest of Stalingrad, enemy offensives have been repelled. Our forces have made some progress in the Kalach area.

### Germany Claims Breakthrough of Stalingrad Defense Line, Fierce Soviet Counter-Offensive in Central Region

Berlin, 31st, Havas News Agency - The German official statement issued recently is as follows: South of the Kuban River, German-Romanian allied forces continue to make progress. Soviet troops have been forced to retreat to the Black Sea coast, and one Soviet vessel has been sunk by our bombing. South of Stalingrad, our troops have broken through the Soviet defense line and are only 15 miles from the city. The city has been bombed by our air force, and the fire has spread extensively. Military targets east of the Volga River have been bombed by our air force. In the Rzhev area, the enemy continues to attack with infantry and tanks in several places, and the fighting is very fierce. Forty-eight Soviet tanks have been destroyed. South of Lake Ladoga, Soviet forces have launched another offensive, but it has been ineffective.

Berlin, 1st, Allied News Agency - The Romanian army south of the lower Kuban River has reached the Black Sea and occupied the port of Anapa. The German army attacking Stalingrad has again made wedge-shaped penetrations into the Soviet defense lines south of the key city on the Volga River, occupying important high ground in the suburbs. The main force of the German army attacking Stalingrad in the southern district - German infantry divisions and mechanized units - have stormed into the Soviet fortified lines. The German air force is assisting in the battle, bombing Soviet positions and continuously attacking the urban areas of Stalingrad. Several airfields east of the city have also been heavily bombed by German aircraft.

### German Offensive on Southern Route Encounters Resistance, Soviet Union Remains a Mystery of the Times

Stockholm, Swedish Capital, 31st, Havas News Agency - The advance of the German army in the three regions of Mozdok, Grozny, and Ordzhonikidze in the Caucasus, as well as the mountains of Kerch, has greatly slowed down. Since the German army occupied the city of Elista on the 12th of this month and the city of Georgievsk on the 15th, the German side has remained silent on the development of the war in the Caucasus, with no further announcements. Neutral observers in Berlin are waiting every day for the German side to issue a communiqu√© explaining the situation on the front lines. In the central sector, according to German sources, the Red Army has launched another major offensive northwest of the city of Kaluga and around the city of Rzhev. The Red Army under General Zhukov, despite the determined resistance of the German army, has crossed the upper reaches of the Volga River the day before yesterday, but its advance is still slow due to heavy losses. Today, the current European war has entered its fourth year. The future of the German army is attracting worldwide attention. According to reports, the German army's summer offensive on the Eastern Front this year was launched on June 28, starting from the city of Kursk, occupying the city of Voronezh on July 7, occupying Rostov on July 24, and occupying the two cities of Melitopol and Krasnodar on August 10, and taking advantage of the victory to attack the gateway to the Caucasus, reaching the central Caucasus. But since then, it has encountered fierce resistance from the Red Army, which the German General Staff does not deny. The blitzkrieg tactics adopted by the German army have now become a brutal war in the Caucasus and a battle for Stalingrad. According to the German intention, it is eager to achieve its goals before winter arrives, so the Axis powers must do everything possible to promote their realization. Only by achieving this goal can the German side have a good line of defense to hold and spend the harsh winter. Assuming the German army is able to capture Stalingrad, the lower Volga River, Astrakhan, and the Caspian coast, the fate of the Soviet Union will also be a matter of concern to the world. But at this moment, hardly anyone can give a definite answer to this. The Axis powers naturally hope to destroy the Soviet arms industry, cut off the source of Soviet imports, and hinder Soviet agriculture and its food supply, thereby causing famine in the Soviet Union and triggering a domestic crisis. In addition, the Axis powers want to use the natural resources of the Caucasus for long-term warfare, because once the Axis powers have finished fighting on the Eastern Front, they will have no worries about looking east and can move their troops westward. However, the Soviet Union remains a mystery of the times, which has repeatedly surprised the world, and this is worth noting.

Some people recalled that Prime Minister Tojo has always adopted a smooth attitude towards domestic affairs, so it is believed that the Prime Minister personally approves of the established methods for all important wartime policies.

### Battle of Zhejiang-Jiangxi, Comprehensive Results of the Japanese Army

Central News Agency, Shanghai - Since the Japanese army began operations in the Zhejiang-Jiangxi area on May 15, although it has been encountering continuous heavy rains and sweltering heat, the progress has been very rapid. By June 15, Shangrao was occupied, only one month from the start of the operation. Afterwards, the various units of the Japanese army coordinated with the newly arrived troops attacking from the west, and the two armies met in Hengfeng on July 1, completing the operation to open the entire Zhejiang-Jiangxi line. They then began the Lishui-Wenzhou operation, the Songyang operation, and the mopping up of the remaining defending troops around the occupied areas. In late August, the various units of the Japanese army simultaneously launched new operations and are now expanding their gains. During the two months from mid-June to mid-August, the Japanese army launched more than 200 attacks. During this period, the comprehensive results of the Japanese army are as follows: buried 5,998 corpses of defending soldiers, captured 782 prisoners, intercepted 17 mortars, 8,300 mortar shells, 2 anti-aircraft guns, 26,000 anti-aircraft gun shells, 29 various gun barrels, 104 heavy machine guns, 104 light machine guns (including 2 light machine guns for aircraft), 44,000 machine gun bullets, 1,765 various field gun and mountain gun shells, 28 grenade launchers, 4,250 rounds of ammunition, 261 grenade rifles, 616,300 rounds of ammunition, 2 Western cannons, 24 automatic rifles, 6 automatic pistols, 12,906 rifles, 43 pistols, 525,000 rifle bullets, 3,000 pistol bullets, 21,000 hand grenades, 416 landmines, 13,000 bayonets, 60 sets of communication equipment, 9 locomotives, 70 freight cars, 24 automobiles, 26 generators, 3 engines, 100,000 kilograms of kerosene, and a large number of other military supplies such as tung oil and fluorite. After the Japanese army began military operations in the Zhejiang-Jiangxi area, it has captured Shangrao, the base of the Chongqing army, and controlled the Third War Zone. However, there are still remnants of the Chongqing army remaining in the area. According to a merchant who recently arrived in Shanghai from Xinchang, the remnants of the Chongqing army, due to a lack of funds, are confiscating weapons and materials from the people. The heads of various townships are being monitored, and many have submitted their resignations. The remnants of the Chongqing army are selling the confiscated items from various places. Recently, the Chongqing army in the Third War Zone conscripted laborers to fill the ranks of new soldiers. About 2,300 defeated soldiers of a certain division of the Chongqing army mutinied.

Stockholm, Swedish Capital, 1st, Haithong News Agency - Washington dispatch, US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau told the Bankers Association yesterday that more than half of the US's national revenue for the following year will be used for war, so strict control and restrictions must be implemented on all other expenses. Even if Congress can pass the tax bill and approve the issuance of $120 billion in public debt, it is feared that massive borrowing will still be needed. As for the content of the tax bill, Morgenthau refused to announce it, only saying that he deeply hopes that the American people can shoulder heavier burdens. In the future, the American salary class will withdraw 10 percent of their income as savings, hoping to obtain $40 million per month for national use.

Lisbon, 1st, Haithong News Agency - Statistics released in Washington show that the total amount of credit loans issued by the US government for military expenditures has reached a staggering $220 billion.

### Romania's Foreign Policy, Unwavering Opposition to the Soviet Union

Bern, Swiss Capital, 1st, Havas News Agency, according to the Neue Z√ºrcher Zeitung dispatch from the Hungarian capital, during the recent negotiations between Romanian and Hungarian representatives, Miron Cristea, former leader of the Romanian National Peasant Party, sent a letter to the chief Romanian representative, Constantin PƒÉucƒÉ, expressing dissatisfaction with Romania's foreign policy, especially the issue of Transylvania (Transylvania Province originally belonged to Hungary, but was ceded to Romania after the last World War. It has belonged to Hungary again since the outbreak of this war, and the two sides have been in constant dispute). PƒÉucƒÉ replied, saying that if Romania joins the Anglo-Saxon group, the result will only be to entrust itself to the Soviet Union. Conversely, if Romania maintains contact with the Axis powers, it can offset the Soviet Union's imperialist ambitions and ensure the safety of Southeastern Europe and the Dardanelles. The Soviet Union's annexation of Romania's Bessarabia province in 1940 (which has been recovered by Romania) and its ambition to control the Danube River basin have not died, which proves that the country has not forgotten this.

### Front in Egypt Breaks the Silence, Axis Forces Launch New Offensive, Fierce Fighting All Day with No Progress

### British Troops Completely Withdraw from Ethiopian Capital, Martial Law Declared in Iran, Germany Not Surprised

Lisbon, 1st, Allied News Agency, according to a report from London, all British troops stationed in the Ethiopian capital have been withdrawn, leaving only about 50 guards at the British Embassy and a few specialized personnel. As for British troops in other parts of Ethiopia, except for those near the border with French Somaliland and the Ethiopian railway guards, they will all be withdrawn soon.

Sofia, 1st, Haithong News Agency - According to reports from Tehran and Istanbul, martial law has been declared in the areas occupied by the Iranian army. Large Soviet troops are conducting armed patrols on the streets of occupied cities. Strict military measures force residents in rural areas to protect the transportation of Soviet war materials in order to prevent them from being robbed by thugs. Occasionally, cars full of soldiers speed through the streets, opening fire on suspicious people. According to Tehran, the declaration of martial law in Iran is a "precautionary measure" and is not a necessary measure caused by domestic unrest. After the Iranian government declared martial law, it was convenient for the British and Soviet authorities to deploy troops in Iran to prevent the development of the Caucasus region.

Berlin, 1st, Reuter News Agency - Political figures here were not surprised by the declaration of martial law throughout Iran. It is claimed that since the British and Soviet troops invaded Iran, the Iranian people have suffered from political oppression and economic hardship. As a result, the number of Iranian rebels has been increasing day by day, and the declaration of martial law was expected.

Gasoline has been requisitioned for military use, and the number of cars running in Rio de Janeiro has been reduced. At the same time, the police continue to arrest Axis nationals, with several cases occurring every day.

Lisbon, 1st, Haithong News Agency - The "Maharaj Daily," which is close to the government, published a commentary today stating that the Portuguese government's declaration of spiritual solidarity with Brazil does not have any special practical significance, because Portugal continues to maintain its neutral policy. The newspaper referred to the Anglo-Portuguese alliance, pointing out that Portugal maintains close and traditional ties with several belligerent countries, but these ties are well-established facts. Although Portugal and Brazil are geographically separated, their spirits often converge. The "Maharaj Daily" commented on the background of Brazil's entry into the war, saying that since the United States openly advocated intervention, the spread of the war to South America was inevitable. The reason why South America has formed a group with Washington is due to South America's economic dependence on the United States.

New York, 1st, Havas News Agency - Robert Rune, a researcher at the British Royal Institute of International Affairs, arrived here today from Lisbon on a Clipper flying boat. He said that the Portuguese Prime Minister himself told him that the country's democratic politics are increasingly corrupt and that the government changes every six months.

### Major Department Stores Adjusted Prices Yesterday, Complying with Price Control Measures; Pricing Policies Are Extremely Complex

The once-calm price situation in Shanghai has, since yesterday, shown significant fluctuations due to the joint announcement of new price control measures by relevant authorities, and their determination to implement them with a stricter attitude than before. The six major companies on Nanjing Road‚ÄîSincere, Wing On, Sun Sun, The Sun, Lane Crawford, and China National Goods‚Äîhave reduced the prices of various goods by 20 to 50 percent from the previous day's prices, starting yesterday, attracting crowds of buyers. The situation in other smaller department stores is slightly different, with less impact. However, they are expected to negotiate new prices through the valuation committee of the industry association in the near future.

Price Reductions Vary After Two Meetings

The major department stores on Nanjing Road are now operating under the supervision of the Central China Liaison Office of the Asia Development Board. After the rumor of new price control measures by the authorities emerged at the end of last month, the Asia Development Board immediately convened representatives of these companies to discuss price cuts. Another meeting was held yesterday morning. Therefore, in the past day or two, these companies have continuously depreciated prices twice. The prices yesterday afternoon were about 70 percent of the average prices of the 30th and 31st of last month. In other words, prices were reduced by one-third. However, some items were reduced even more. Generally speaking, Western clothing items were reduced by half, stationery items by one-third. Among daily necessities, the prices of umbrellas and parasols were reduced the most, by about half. Leather shoes were sometimes reduced by one to two hundred yuan. The China National Goods Company closed early at 2 PM due to internal reorganization. Various marked prices were adjusted to comply with the authorities' price regulations within appropriate limits. The company will resume normal business operations starting today.

Pricing Policies Are Extremely Complex

According to the decree of the Concession authorities, the marked price for goods should be half of the average old legal tender price from May 26th to May 28th of this year. This principle applies to those who re-priced goods in new currency after May 26th. Those who initially used deposit certificates for pricing are prohibited from increasing prices without approval from the authorities. The major companies on Nanjing Road belong to the latter category. The pricing policies of major department stores are extremely complex. The price lists include old legal tender prices from May 26th, advance prices (i.e., previous purchase prices), current selling prices (i.e., prices from a day or two ago), new purchase prices (new goods purchase prices), and new negotiated prices (i.e., new prices implemented yesterday). In principle, the highest executive office negotiates and determines the pricing principles, and then each department separately determines prices based on price trends. Because there is a distinction between new and old incoming goods, and differences in the length of time goods have been in stock, it is extremely difficult to revise prices based on a single standard. Older inventory has lower prices, while newer inventory has slightly higher prices. Older incoming goods have lower prices, while newly incoming goods have higher prices. What the major companies are planning now is to find a common average value among these different costs and use it as the new selling price, and to make it as close as possible to half of the old legal tender price from the end of May.

### Evacuation of American Nationals Has Been Postponed

The English-language Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury reports that Mr. Masaki, chief translator of the Japanese Consulate General, told reporters this morning (the 1st) that the second batch of North and South American nationals returning from the Far East has been postponed. Therefore, the repatriation ships Conte Verde and Asama Maru, which were originally scheduled to leave Shanghai on September 9th and 10th, will also be postponed. The Japanese Consulate General received this news from Tokyo yesterday morning.

### Trolleybus Route 18 Reconnected Yesterday

The trolleybus service in the Public and French Concessions resumed partial operation yesterday, which was very convenient for the citizens. Trolleybus route 18, running between the North Railway Station and the Xietu Road, used to turn around at the Great World, making it inconvenient for people traveling between the two concessions to transfer. However, starting yesterday, the trolleybus route has resumed operation. The fares remain the same as before, with tickets purchased separately for each district. As for trolleybus route 17, which runs between the Sichuan Road Bridge and Dapu Bridge, it has not yet resumed operation. It is likely that the operation of route 18 is a trial run. If the results are satisfactory, route 17 will also be implemented soon.

### Young Girl's Arm Pierced by Rice Spike Following Her Father

Yesterday morning at around 9 AM, a man named Yu Chunyao purchased rice noodles from a rice store at 36 Guangxi Road. While walking with his young daughter at the intersection of Wuma Road and Shilu Road, the daughter suddenly screamed. Upon inspection, two holes were found piercing the girl's arm, with blood flowing profusely. The cause was unknown. At this moment, a Xi surname member of the 4th Jia 6th Gang Self-Defense Corps captured a young man resembling a beggar, holding an extremely sharp small knife. His intentions were unknown. It was reported that he was an apprentice at a theatrical costume shop on Guangxi Road. The girl was immediately sent to Renji Hospital for treatment. The Self-Defense Corps member then negotiated with the shop owner to cover the medical expenses. Yu Chunyao repeatedly thanked the Self-Defense Corps member for his service.

### Pork Price Limit

The Shanghai Municipal Council's restriction on the retail price of pork in the Public Concession was implemented the day before yesterday. The limited fresh meat prices, calculated per catty, are as follows: leg meat, shoulder meat, ribs, streaky pork, and lard, all at eight yuan and sixty cents per catty; trotters at six yuan and twenty cents per catty; and pig's feet at four yuan and forty cents per catty. The price limit set by the Shanghai Municipal Council this time is very fair and already provides a reasonable profit.

### Resumption of Business at Bank of China and Bank of Communications Yesterday; All Receipts and Payments Limited to Deposit Certificates; Clearing of Checks Conducted as Usual

Depositors were allowed to withdraw the full amount without any restrictions. However, all receipts and payments were limited to Central Reserve Certificates. For the convenience of depositors, designated staff members were assigned to fill out withdrawal slips for them. However, there were very few deposits and withdrawals made by depositors yesterday; instead, many people opened new accounts with cash or checks. The two banks continued to handle interest on various deposits according to the previous rates, with the current rate being four percent, and there were no interest rate reductions.

Check Clearing Conducted as Usual

Regarding the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications sending personnel to join the Check Clearing House to resume check clearing, the responsible persons of the two banks stated that the two banks had not withdrawn from the Check Clearing House after December 8th of last year. The dispatched staff members have always assisted with office work within the Check Clearing House; therefore, there is no question of resuming participation in the Check Clearing House.

Continued Handling of Stock Registration

After the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications were ordered to handle the registration of merchant shares, a notice was issued stating, "From September 1st, all matters regarding stock registration (Bank of China's Stock Affairs Department on the third floor of 50 Hankou Road) (Bank of Communications' head office at 999 Jing'an Temple Road) will continue to be handled, with a deadline of January 31st, 1943. We hope you will take note of this." We hope that all merchant shareholders will register their shares within the deadline.

As a result, Sanyi defeated Guangming Women's Team by six to one, achieving a good start. In another match, Shenlong played against Huabu. The strength of both sides was quite even.

The market for daily necessities is as dull as a wooden chicken. Supply and demand is quiet. Market sentiment is easy to fall and difficult to rise. Because the match combination will distribute Phoenix brand, the price is the same as before. Each box is still limited to 3 jiao, so people are tired and exhausted. If Phoenix brand is opened at 2,200 yuan, few people want it, Beauty brand is 2,550 yuan, Golden Tripod brand is 2,150 yuan, miscellaneous brand is 1,800 yuan, all are available but there is no market.

### Gold Price Stagnant

Yesterday, the gold and silver industry in this city, the Dashin Peer Jewelry, still listed 2,150 yuan per tael of gold (buying in is reduced by about 300 yuan).

### The Lyceum Theatre's Reopening is Scheduled, With Lu Luming Taking the Lead

‚Äî Yi Qing

The Lyceum Theatre, located in the Western residential area of Maillard Road and Bouillon Road, is considered by many to be an aristocratic theater. In the past, it often staged Western plays, so few Chinese people went to see them. It wasn't until Tianma performed "The Hegemon King of Chu" for a month this spring that it gradually attracted the attention of theatergoers. Later, Yao Ke took over as the performance manager, and the "Tang Family Troupe" and Rong Wei also performed "Narcissus" and "Autumn" there on a large scale, which began to make the location popular. But good times don't last, and it was sealed for some reason, so the Lyceum Theatre fell into a state of loneliness.

News has come that the Lyceum Theatre is scheduled to reopen, but the management has a new organization, and it is said that a certain person has been specially appointed as the theater's business manager to oversee everything. At the same time, the Lyceum Theatre is most suitable for staging plays, so after this news came out, several theater groups immediately competed for it.

It is not yet known who will obtain the right to perform regularly in the future, but Lu Luming will be the first to perform. In short, Lu Luming has obtained the consent of the company and has a strong backstage. Starting from the 15th of this month, she will make her debut at the Lyceum Theatre after its reopening, with the world-famous stage play "Lady Windermere's Fan."

After being promoted by Xu Xingzhi, Lu Luming has a considerable reputation on the stage, but it seems that she is not very successful on the screen. After joining "China United", she only co-starred with Mei Xi in a movie "A Big Stir at Sea". This time, she is returning to the stage to perform "Lady Windermere's Fan", perhaps to revive her reputation in one fell swoop.

### Yu Shuyan's Serious Illness

According to people from Beiping: Yu Shuyan, the Tan-style laosheng (old male role) actor of Peking Opera, has recently suffered a serious change in his illness, and doctors are helpless. His life is in danger.

### Brief Records of the Pear Garden

‚Äî Shu Dai Sheng

‚óá Huang Jin received a telegram from Wu Suqiu yesterday, saying that she would be traveling south by train yesterday morning (the 1st) and would arrive in Shanghai tonight.

‚óá Wang Yurong, the new star of the Queen's Grand Theatre, is scheduled to travel south by train with Zhou Xiaotian and others on the 12th of this month. The theatre is scheduled to officially open on the 19th of this month.

‚óá The new stars of the Gengxin Theatre were originally Zheng Bingru, Li Zongyi, Yan Shishan, and Li Duokui. Later, Zheng could not spare time because the filming of Lei Ying's work was about to begin, so the agreement with Gengxin had to be postponed. The theatre's director, knowing that he could not force him, started anew and invited Li Yuzhi to fill the vacancy. Li is one of the "Four Jade" of the drama school, and her beauty and artistry are comparable to Li Yuru. She is particularly good at hua dan (young female role) plays. According to Mr. He Haisheng, Li Yuzhi and Li Zongyi's contracts have been completed, and Yan Shishan and Li Duokui's salary has also been paid. Everything should be fine. As for when they can start their journey south, I have not yet received a telegram from Beiping, so I cannot be sure. However, it is expected that when Queen Wang Yurong and Zhou Xiaotian arrive in Shanghai, the three Li's and one Yan of Gengxin will also arrive soon.

‚óá The new play "The Heavenly River Marriage" at the Grand Theatre has been performed for half a month, and the sales of seats have not declined. The appeal of the protagonist Cao Huiying is amazing. Now, in order to compete with other theatres, the theatre has decided to reuse the sheng (male role) actor Lin Shusen. "The Heavenly River Marriage" will be performed until the night show on the 2nd. Starting from the 3rd, Lin will join the cast and perform old plays for three days. From the 5th, they will start rehearsing a "supernatural swordsman novel," which is expected to be exciting, with many new props. The sales of seats are expected to be prosperous.

‚óá Song Baoqing and Song Ziping, brother and sister, are performing at the Dongwu Grand Theatre in Suzhou. They have been performing for almost a month, and the sales of seats have not declined. Now, at the request of the theatre owner, they are allowed to continue for another week, and will then go to Wuxi to perform.

### Autumn Sounds of the Drama School

‚Äî Kaiming

The drama school has been on summer vacation for more than a month, and the reason why it has not resumed performances is because it is rushing to rehearse a large number of new plays. Now, the public performance is scheduled, so I will write an article to promote it.

The actors of the Song Theatre Troupe who came south this time are all outstanding talents from the Beiping Opera School. Most of them were hired by the school to teach opera, so the heroes gathered on the Maillard Road, as if the two drama schools in the north and south had joined together.

The new plays include "Yang Paifeng and the Hu Family Village", co-taught by Song Nongzhu and Zhao Chuanxun; "Suo Lianhuan Stealing the Double Hook", taught by Wang Jinlu and Yin Jinzhen; "Nine Watch Nights", taught by Guan Dexian; and "He Jinhai's Exclusive Teaching" etc. In addition, the famous qingyi (serious female role) Huang Guiqiu also taught two excellent excerpts, "The Spring and Autumn Marriage" and the entire "Three Mothers Teach Son".

"Hu Family Village" is a kunqiang (a style of Chinese opera) key play for female warriors, with many complex movements. Compared with "Yang Paifeng", it is shorter but more difficult to please the audience. Students without both literary and martial skills dare not try it. Now, Song Dezhu excels at this and teaches it to Gu Ziqiu of the school. With a famous teacher and a talented student, the performance will naturally be outstanding. The school will also change the "Later Story of Emerald Screen Mountain" to "Shi Xiu Exploring the Village", followed by "Hu Family Village", to form the complete "Golden Stone Alliance". It is also unique to the school that the play involves characters from Liangshan.

The complete "Suo Lianhuan" and "The Spring and Autumn Marriage" will be staged within this week. In addition to the above-mentioned plays, there are many new plays that have been prepared and will be presented to us one by one. With the spirit of the teachers and the efforts of the students, their progress will surely exceed our imagination.

### Iron Voice Zhu Dinghua

‚Äî Weihan

Among ordinary men, those who can sing beautifully are as rare as phoenix feathers. Because to have a vivid singing voice, one must have a gifted voice, diligent practice, and years of experience... so it is not easy to achieve by luck.

Recently, the writer discovered a student‚ÄîZhu Dinghua. He has a resonant iron voice and often participates in student gatherings and performances. Every song evokes the appreciation of the audience. Because he is not a "singer", few people know him. I am writing this article to introduce Mr. Zhu to the fans.

### Ding Zhi Will Change Career

‚Äî Lan Ying

Ding Zhi, a stage artist, wrote a movie script called "New Woman" a few years ago, but unfortunately it was not adopted by any film company. At the same time, the theatrical troupe he belonged to disbanded, so he intended to leave the art world. When the Shangyi Troupe was established, he returned to his old profession, but now Shangyi has temporarily suspended operations for some reason. Ding Zhi is at home with nothing to do and wants to adapt "New Woman" into a stage play. Suddenly, he had a whim and declared that he was determined to leave the stage and enter the banking industry. (Lan Ying)

Brief News: The fifteenth day of the tenth month of the national calendar (the sixteenth day of the ninth month of the lunar calendar) is the 100th birthday of Mr. Yuan Ludeng's father, Mr. Bian Yuan, with the posthumous title of Zhenjing, and the 80th birthday of his wife, Madam Hu, with the posthumous title of Ci Hui. His disciples, "Yuan's Woxuelou Disciples' Joint Gathering", plan to hold a grand celebration at that time. The address has been secured at the Ningbo Fellow Association, and Zhang Zhongyuan, Bao Xiaodie, Zhang Boming, and Gu Futang have been appointed as the directors of theatrical affairs. People from the opera and performing circles have enthusiastically participated. It is said that if there are too many guests, the Da Shanghai Grand Theatre will be rented as the venue for the hall performance. Negotiations are currently underway. At that time, Shanghai celebrities will launch a project to build a centennial memorial hall for Mr. Yuan.

### Sailing in the Same Boat

‚Äî He Jia Zhi

(8) What to Do

Wei Yunqing replied without hesitation, "Cui Zhen is here." Madam Ye Er was worried that Wei Yunqing would say she didn't know, but now it was unexpected, so she continued to ask, "Where is she?" Wei Yunqing said, "She is in my home." Madam Ye Er said, "I know she is at your residence, but which room is she in? We didn't see her when we landed on the Hou River. Can you call her out?" Wei Yunqing smiled and said, "Let me think about it. Oh, no. If she comes, my second sister-in-law won't hand her over to me in person. Now, my second sister-in-law can't ask me for her. I'm sorry." Madam Ye Er saw that Wei Yunqing was smiling, but his words were unreasonable, so she was a little dissatisfied and said, "Mr. Wei, you are a big landlord in the area. You can't be unreasonable. Our family is in decline. Last night, we were robbed, and some property was stolen. What's more, Miss Cui Zhen is missing. Now that Cui Zhen is at your home, it can be concluded that someone handed Cui Zhen over to you. The person who handed Cui Zhen over to you is the person who came to our house last night to rob us. This not only involves Cui Zhen, but also a robber, and the robbery case in our family is also solved in connection. I ask you, who handed Cui Zhen over to you?"

Wei Yunqing's face flushed red, and he picked up an abacus and fiddled with the beads for a while, then coughed dryly a few times andÂãâÂº∫ÂãâÂº∫ smiled: "I don't have to tell you who handed Cui Zhen over to me!" Madam Ye Er, although a woman, refused to give in and pointed her finger: "You don't have to tell me, what kind of words are these? I want to see Cui Zhen now. You call Cui Zhen out and let me ask her. Who robbed her, who handed her over to you? I think she usually stays at home and rarely goes out. It must have been her uncle, Fei Changhe, who caused this." Madam Ye Er lumped Fei Changhe and Cui Zhen together, which made Wei Yunqing angry. He grabbed the abacus and slammed it on the table and said, "Please don't interfere in my family's affairs, okay?" Madam Ye Er's face changed, but she was not panicked. She sneered and said, "Mr. Wei, you have more money, but I have more reason." (170)
