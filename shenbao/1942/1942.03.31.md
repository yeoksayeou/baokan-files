This was the 21st air raid on the port by Japanese planes. Local newspapers are commenting on the matter, saying that the recent three bombings of the port by Japanese planes were not as intense as before, presumably because the Japanese are trying to disperse enemy air power, forcing the US and Australian air forces to vacate planes to protect airfields in New Guinea. In addition, it is reported that Allied Commander-in-Chief General Macarthur plans to stay in Canberra for a few days before going to headquarters to take office.

However, one difficulty is that the war may not be over by the next election in 1944. If the war is over by then, the American people will definitely give Macarthur an opportunity to enter politics.

Berlin, 29th (Havas News Agency) - Iran was originally divided by Britain and the Soviet Union, but in reality, it has become a Soviet experiment. Lately, the Soviet Union, regardless of whether Britain will raise objections in the future, is making incremental progress and making every effort to Sovietize Iran. In the past twelve days, the Iranian capital has been under the control of the Soviet Union, and people are panicked and living in terror. The authorities are currently taking various self-defense measures. Although the Soviet News Agency and American visitors have issued news stating that the situation in Iran is "absolutely normal," in reality, it has reached a state of terror. Therefore, how the Iranian people will react is a matter of great concern. If the Iranian people unite and wash away the shame caused by the treasonous government, Iran will surely be able to restore its importance in the Middle East.

### Vichy Impressed by Attack on Saint-Nazaire

Vichy, 29th (Havas News Agency) - The British attack on the French port of Saint-Nazaire two days ago has caused a deep impression here. This port is the newest naval base in Europe and even the world, located at the mouth of the Loire River. The world-famous dry dock is located there, and there are all kinds of wharf facilities nearby. There are two dry docks in total, one in the port and one in the Penhoët port. The world's largest mail ship, the "Normandie," was built in the Penhoët shipyard. The main purpose of this British raid was obviously to destroy the dry dock of Saint-Nazaire, which was completed in 1932 and is 350 feet long. Both the left and right ends have sluice gates that can be closed, with the sluice gate on the right being the largest and the main entrance to the port. As for the fact that several British troops were able to carry out a landing and were repelled by German troops only after invading the city, this was due to the fact that the city and the port were too close together. Since last winter, the British have attempted to land in Europe for the _ time, but this is the first time that the US military has achieved considerable results. According to reports, the British first attempted to directly attack the Lofoten Islands in northern Norway last year, and then attempted to land on the coast of Normandy in France, but both times were unsuccessful. The British troops participating in the Saint-Nazaire landing totaled three or four hundred men, one hundred of whom have been captured by German troops. As for the details of the naval battle that took place between the British and German light warships at the mouth of the Loire River, they are not known. What is known is that the water at the mouth of the Loire River is not deep, and even small warships cannot move quickly.

Berlin, 30th (Haitong News Agency) - According to military visitor Blazes, British planes circled _ empty every night, and British ships approached Saint-Nazaire early in the morning the day before yesterday. The British fleet included several motorboats and a destroyer. Scottish troops landed by kayak and occupied several docks, but were discovered by German searchlights. The British ship was hit and caught fire, and the destroyer attempted to escape but was sunk. Although the British troops resisted stubbornly, they were forced to retreat into the harbor city, and street fighting broke out. German troops cleared the landing British troops before noon.

London, 29th (Havas News Agency) - Part of the British troops who attacked the French port of Saint-Nazaire returned to a port in this country tonight. Most of them were seriously injured, and several ambulances were waiting to pick them up at the dock.

### US Transfers Part of Gold to South American Countries

Washington, 29th (Havas News Agency) - The Treasury Department recently issued a message stating that the US government has transferred part of its gold reserves to various republics in South America. At the end of February this year, the total cash reserves of the United States amounted to $22.74 billion, a decrease of approximately $80 million compared to before the United States entered the war. As of the end of November last year, the United States had a total of $22.784 billion in gold, which was the highest record in the last eight years. According to local financial figures, the decrease in gold is mainly due to the foreign trade surplus of Latin American countries. In addition, the fact that some countries have converted their reserves into cash reserves is also one of the reasons for the outflow of American gold.

The outline stipulates that after the current war ends, the Indian Constituent Assembly will draft a constitution to establish the Indian Federation, obtain dominion status, and be under the jurisdiction of the British King like other dominions of the British Empire. However, they will be completely equal to other dominions in terms of internal and external affairs. After this constitution is drafted, the government will naturally immediately recognize it. However, the Indian provinces that do not wish to accept this new constitution and wish to maintain their current constitutional system will not be subject to it. In addition, the British government and the Indian Constitutional Drafting Assembly will sign a treaty to protect the racial and religious status of various ethnic minorities within India. The Constitutional Drafting Assembly will be elected by the entire members of the lower house of the provincial assemblies after the re-election of the provincial assemblies after the war, using a proportional election law. The Indian states will appoint representatives to participate in the same proportion according to their population.

However, it is difficult for _ people to preside over the defense of India, and even if all parties make this request, it is impossible to change. In short, the plan drawn up by the British War Cabinet can only be accepted in full or rejected, and there is absolutely no room for compromise. The future Indian Federation will have a central parliament, and all states must elect representatives to participate based on the size of their population. The candidates for representatives will be elected by the provincial legislatures. It is understood that the purpose of the British plan is to establish the Indian Federation and, after jointly pledging allegiance to the British King with other autonomous territories, they can immediately be granted equal status with other autonomous territories and no longer be subject to _ in internal and foreign affairs. _ Once the war is over, the British government will recognize the new Indian constitution based on the above principles. However, Indian provinces that do not wish to accept it can still retain their current status, and the provinces can conclude treaties with the central parliament to protect the rights of ethnic and religious minorities. However, for the time being, the British government sincerely hopes that the Indians will immediately participate in the war to defend their homeland and the British Empire. Cripps _ has expressed that the above plan is the best solution for the happiness and freedom of 350 million Indians.

### Increase in Corpses on the Streets; Urgent Plea for Prompt Collection; Prolonged Exposure is Detrimental to Public Health

In recent days, due to the uneven weather, there has been a sudden increase in the number of impoverished people residing in the alleys or along the roadsides, who cannot bear the combined effects of poverty and illness, hunger, and drug addicts who succumb to disease. Furthermore, the charitable organizations, relying solely on manpower to collect these corpses found on the streets, are slow in their work. Consequently, corpses in remote roadside locations have remained uncollected for as long as two or three days, exposed to sun and rain, inevitably decaying and emitting foul odors. This not only concerns hygiene but also encourages unscrupulous and base individuals to seize the opportunity to strip the corpses of their clothing for sale. Some corpses have even been found completely naked, a ghastly sight to behold. It is earnestly hoped that the health and police authorities will pay attention to this matter, upholding humanitarian principles and public health.

### Vegetable Cultivation Methods - Youth Association Agricultural Lecture - Lecture by Sheng Chengshi

Vegetables are essential foods for human life, and their importance is second only to food grains. There are those who can maintain their health with an exclusively vegetarian diet, but none can achieve rich nutrition with an exclusively carnivorous diet. This shows that the various nutrients contained in vegetables, such as vitamins A, B, C, and iron and calcium, are not necessarily all found in meat. You can compare the health of vegetarians and meat-eaters to prove my point. At a time when meat is expensive, the need for vegetables is even more pressing. Now that we recognize the importance of vegetables, we should study vegetable cultivation methods to increase their production. This is undoubtedly a secondary solution to the problem of food for the people. In the suburbs of the city, for example, a family of five with three mu of thin land cannot possibly sustain their livelihood by planting rice or cotton. However, by cultivating a vegetable garden, they can harvest three to five crops a year. If managed properly, they can certainly sustain their lives with a surplus.

Types of Vegetables: Melon and Fruit Vegetables - Cucumbers, tomatoes, winter melons, loofahs, eggplants, etc.; Pod Vegetables - Broad beans, peas, soybeans, etc.; Root Vegetables - Radishes, sweet potatoes, beets, etc.; Underground Stem Vegetables - Potatoes, etc.; Leaf Vegetables - Spinach, greens, cabbage, etc.; Flower and Fruit Vegetables - Cauliflower; Stem Vegetables - Chives, onions, garlic, etc.; Tender Stem Vegetables - Asparagus; Miscellaneous - Strawberries, mushrooms, etc.

Types of Vegetable Gardens: Home Vegetable Garden; Small-scale Vegetable Garden; Large-scale Vegetable Garden; Processing-Specific Vegetable Garden (i.e., the attached vegetable garden of a canning factory); Forcing Vegetable Garden (with heating and other equipment to make vegetables mature early).

### Special Security Measures in the International Settlement Completely Lifted; Strict Inspection of Pedestrians and Vehicles on Previous Two Days; All Bridges Over Suzhou Creek Required to Pass in Line

The International Settlement implemented special security measures for three days starting on the 28th. During this period, in addition to imposing temporary martial law in some areas and intensifying the search of pedestrians, no obstacles were seen set up at the intersection with the French Concession, and vehicles and pedestrians moved freely. However, the inspection of pedestrians on the bridges over Suzhou Creek was very strict, especially for those traveling from south to north. In addition to tram passengers disembarking as usual and walking across the bridge, pedestrians had to line up and cross the bridge one by one. According to a Datong News Agency reporter who patrolled the bridges yesterday afternoon, a winding line of people crossing the bridge was found at the southern end of the Tianhou Temple Bridge, extending westward to Beijing Road, resembling a funeral procession. This phenomenon was not observed at other bridges. On the previous two days, Japanese naval landing forces also deployed posts at important intersections in the central district from time to time, searching passing pedestrians and vehicles. However, traffic was not cut off. According to reporters, temporary martial law was implemented successively in the Sichuan Road, Fuzhou Road, and Beijing Road areas. In addition to dispatching more detectives to patrol and guard their respective jurisdictions, the Shanghai Municipal Police (SMP) also assigned Chinese and Western police officers to station at each tram stop, searching passengers getting on and off the tram to prevent undesirable elements from mixing in. As for the Baojia Self-Defense Corps of the International Settlement, the Baojia organization authorities also issued a notice to each Bao and Jia to dispatch more Self-Defense Corps members to stand guard on the previous two days. It is said that the total number of Self-Defense Corps members on duty was about two thousand. From today, these special security measures have been completely lifted, and traffic in all areas will return to normal. The number of Self-Defense Corps members on duty will also be reduced to the original number.

### Chinese Moral Education Association: Relief for the Poor and Sick; Establishment of Ambulance

### Number of Applications for SMC-Issued Return-to-Hometown Certificates Increases Daily

### Tide Level of Huangpu River Will Gradually Rise Starting Next Month; Dredging Work in Various Sections of Huangpu River Still in Progress

The tides of the Huangpu River will gradually rise starting next month, as the spring tide low tide period has already passed. Generally, it will reach its peak during the autumn tide. As for the seawater outside the Wusong Estuary, there will likely be no large-scale intrusion in the winter, spring, and summer seasons, so there will be no cases of the Huangpu River water becoming salty. Since last winter, the Huangpu Conservancy Bureau has been using the Hong Kong dredger, along with its existing dredgers, to dredge various wharves along the Huangpu River, and the results have been excellent. This has significantly benefited the flow of the Huangpu River water and the navigation of ships.

### In the Case of the Robbery of 320,000 Yuan, the Police Have Captured Several Criminals; The Mastermind, "Little Dog," Is Still at Large

On the morning of January 16 of this year, the four Shanghai banks of Tianbao, Datong, Jinfeng, and Baocheng, located at No. 5, Lane 444, Jiujiang Road, sent their employees to Shanghai from Nanjing with 220,000 yuan in cash for trading. When they passed the intersection of North Henan Road and Haining Road, they were suddenly attacked and robbed of all the money by several armed robbers. The police officers who arrived on the scene shot and killed one of the robbers, "Little Eight," and seized a Mauser pistol. It is now learned that the case has been solved by the International Settlement police. The wife of the deceased robber, "Little Eight," was arrested first. Based on her confession, more than 16 accomplices were subsequently apprehended, and a portion of the stolen money was recovered. As for the leader of the gang of robbers, known as "Little Dog," he is said to have fled far away with a large sum of the stolen money. In addition to interrogating the arrested criminals and scheduling a sentencing hearing on April 1, the police are also rigorously pursuing the mastermind, "Little Dog," to bring him to justice.

### Striving for a Living: Lin Jim, the Shoe Shiner

— Ye Fei

More than ten years ago, a love affair between Wu Airong, a female student in Shanghai, and Lin Jim, a deaf-mute youth, was widely publicized in the newspapers as a touching story, and the fact that the lovers eventually married was particularly exciting. However, within a few years, the divorce storm between Lin and Wu shocked society again. Although Attorney Wu Chengyu and relatives mediated, the broken mirror was mended, but the feelings between the deaf-mute couple gradually cooled, and the passion of their love days when they pledged to grow old together was no longer there.

The day before yesterday, when I was walking through the Great World, I suddenly saw two deaf-mutes gesturing among the long line of shoe shiners. I originally understood some of the sign language of deaf-mutes, so I could not help but be curious, so I stopped and stared at them. Perhaps they noticed that I was watching them, one of them stopped their hand talk and greeted me, meaning to ask if I wanted my shoes shined. On that Western-looking face of his, I vaguely remembered seeing this person somewhere before. A thread of memory suddenly wrapped around my mind, and I abruptly wrote a few words on his palm to ask him:

"Are you Lin Jim, the deaf-mute lover?"

The deaf-mute friend across from him rushed to nod and answer for him. Looking at Lin Jim, a rather unnatural look was revealed on his smiling face. In order to learn a little about the current situation of the deaf-mute lover and the reason for becoming a shoe shiner, I obtained Lin Jim's consent, sat on the canvas stool used for customers, and began our half-gesture, half-written conversation.

"Are your feelings good now?" I asked.

"Still good." He smiled and nodded to me, but after a while, his handsome face was completely shrouded in a cloud of sorrow. Slightly wrinkling his brow, he began to write down everything: (To be continued)

### Shuangma Mill Forward Contracts Show Particularly Strong Upward Momentum

The cotton yarn market started with a rise followed by stability, but the upward momentum of Shuangma Mill forward contracts was particularly strong. This is because there are rumors in the market that there is hope of taking physical delivery. As for Shuangma spot goods, affected by registration, there are more selling settlements and loosening, but major players are calm and unmoved, and even buying at low prices, because inventory is decreasing daily. The opening price of 20-count Shuangma Mill forward contracts was 3,300 yuan, which rose to 3,410 yuan shortly after. Sellers released, and there was a decline, but the buying was very strong, and the price continued to rise to 3,490 yuan at the close. 42-count Lanfeng was 8,250 yuan, falling to 8,050 yuan, closing at 8,230 yuan. 42-count Lima was 8,140 yuan, 40-count Jincheng was 7,650 yuan, 42-count Yanghe was 8,200 yuan, 20-count Yueqin was 4,050 yuan to 4,100 yuan, 20-count Shuangma was 4,000 yuan to 3,820 yuan, closing at 3,880 yuan, 20-count Tiannv was 3,880 yuan, 20-count Jinji was 4,080 yuan, 60-count Niutou was 16,900 yuan, 32-count Honghong was 6,700 yuan, 10-count Hongshuangma was 2,550 yuan to 2,650 yuan.

### No Need to Register Mill and Warehouse Receipts; Cotton Cloth Prices Show Stronger Rise

The factory cloth market yesterday initially fell and then rose, with the price increasing more sharply in the afternoon. Transactions were lively. There were also huge transactions in Yihua Mill and Tongyi Mill coarse cloth factory receipts. White cloth prices rose by 2.5 to 10 yuan, and bleached and dyed cloth prices rose by about 5 yuan. Huadie coarse cloth spot goods were 200 yuan to 205 yuan, factory receipts were 103 yuan to 112 yuan, Fugui fine cloth was 168 yuan to 171 yuan, Feihong coarse cloth was 167 yuan to 172 yuan, 11-pound coarse cloth was 130 yuan, 8-pound Zhenzhong was about 90 yuan, and Chuji Shilin was 255 yuan to 260 yuan. More than 600 pieces were transacted on this street.

Because there is no need to register factory and warehouse receipts for East cloth, the appetite of both insiders and outsiders has become stronger again, and the buying interest has suddenly become strong. The prices of various cloths have risen in a straight line. The opening price of the new Longtou fine cloth was 204 yuan in the morning, rising to 208 yuan at the close. It opened at 212 yuan in the afternoon, rising steadily, with a maximum of 222 yuan, closing at 212 yuan in the evening. Old warehouse receipts were 198 yuan, Feiyu Caiqiu was 200 yuan, Laba was 198 yuan, Wufu was 196 yuan, Baobei fine twill was 165 yuan, Xieyu twill was 170 yuan, and the factory receipts for the Four Gentlemen Serge for October to December were 6.8 yuan. The new red tax was 6.6 yuan.

### Public Bonds Advance Steadily

Yesterday's off-exchange trading of public bonds was quite stable in terms of popularity. Most transactions involved buying strong and selling weak positions, leading to a gradual increase in market prices. This was due to a large number of short covering trades, giving buyers a stronger position. Some sellers, after having sold, realized the upward trend and bought back in to cover their positions. Although the news was generally dull, there were no negative reports, which encouraged buyers. For example, Hongxing and Lianhe firms each entered orders for over ten thousand, while Yongkang and Runde also entered orders for around ten thousand each. Shuntai Dafeng covered short positions, and Tongli entered large buy orders. Tongkang sold over ten thousand of Class C and E bonds, while Dingkang, Dazhong, and Tongyuan all released bonds. Tongyi, Yuxing, and Hefeng all initially sold and then bought back in. As a result, the market price stabilized and continued to rise by five cents, one dime, to three dimes. The total transaction volume was approximately 500,000 yuan. A simplified table is provided below:

Foreign stocks remained stable and strong, with 15,300 shares traded. The Jiahe Yarn Factory was particularly active, accounting for 8,200 shares. The price initially retreated from 26.75 yuan to 26.5 yuan, but ultimately reached 27 yuan. 1,500 shares of Xinhe were traded at 7.5 yuan. 3,500 shares of Yeguang retreated from 18 yuan to 18.2 yuan. 600 shares of British United were traded at 20.05 yuan and 20.075 yuan. Jardine Matheson was traded at 54.5 yuan, electric tramway at 42 yuan, and Xiangtai Timber at 23.5 yuan, each with 100 shares traded. 1,000 shares of Galandans were traded at 8.7 cents, and 200 shares of Langezhi at 14.5 yuan.

Chinese stocks remained flat and weak. China and France (new) were at 48.5 yuan, New Asia (new) at 30.05 yuan, Shenghua Preferred at 16 yuan, Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company at 54 yuan, Wing On Company at 65 yuan (ex-dividend 45.5 yuan), down slightly by two yuan, Sincere at 77.5 yuan, China Underwear (new) at around 18.5 yuan, and Great China Match at 122.5 yuan. Huashang Automobiles were at 17.75 yuan. Trading was sparse.

### Cash and Military Notes Move in Lockstep

Yesterday, the black market for cash was fiercely competitive. Since the registration of cash, the industry has been uncertain about future developments, leading to a wait-and-see attitude. Some small long positions were released, resulting in thin trading volume. Prices initially rose and then fell. After 18,000 yuan was broken, prices retreated. Initially, there was little supply to meet demand, causing buyers to drive up the price. The market opened at 18,500 yuan per bar (ten taels), soaring by 1,150 yuan. Subsequently, a certain gold firm and individual investors released cash, immediately causing the price to retreat to between 17,700 and 17,800 yuan, where it lingered for a long time. A certain jewelry store and money exchange absorbed the supply. Later, securities firms sold cash, causing a further drop of 200 to 300 yuan, reaching a low of 17,450 yuan. Trading became even more sparse, and the market closed at 11:00 AM at 17,500 yuan, which was 150 yuan higher than the closing price on Saturday afternoon. The daily range was 1,050 yuan. After the close, it was heard that military notes had risen, and the price also rose to between 17,600 and 17,700 yuan, and in the afternoon, rose to between 18,200 and 18,300 yuan.

The selling price of gold jewelry per tael at jewelry stores. Daxin and its counterparts initially raised prices by 100 yuan to 1,950 yuan, and then lowered them back to 1,900 yuan (purchase price reduced by 200 yuan), an increase of 50 yuan. Fine silver was listed at 20 yuan, and the black market price was around 13.5 yuan. A silver coin was 8.5 yuan, it was said.

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw stable British pounds and U.S. dollars. The former remained at 400 yuan, and the latter remained at 410 yuan. U.S. dollar drafts remained at 25-26 yuan, and Hong Kong drafts also remained at 3.5 yuan, with large notes reduced by one dime. Military notes opened in the morning at 7.25 yuan, and suddenly soared to 7.75 yuan at noon, finally closing at 7.55 yuan.

Yesterday, the interbank lending rate of the Money Trade Association was nine percent, unchanged. The discount rate for bills of exchange rose by five yuan to ten yuan per thousand yuan, it was said.

### Daily Necessities are Very Weak

The daily necessities market was flat and weak in buying interest. Unfavorable rumors for buyers caused public sentiment to be extremely weak. Some holders of goods took profits and sold, and sales were difficult to boost. Most traders sold more than they bought, so prices gradually fell. Calculated doing business, Guben soap was 350 yuan, Huang Xiangmao soap was 295 yuan, Bai Xiangmao soap was 310 yuan, Arrow soap was 310 yuan, Beautiful Brand matches were 7,400 yuan, Phoenix Brand was 7,000 yuan, Miscellaneous Brand was 5,700 yuan, Sail Brand candles were hundreds of yuan, Monk Hat Brand was 190 yuan, which were uniformly lower than before.

### Feather Yarn Serge Strong

Because the restriction of movement of woolen cloth is imminent, the delivery has been very strong recently. In addition, because a general small number of tenants have come out one after another, the standard market conditions on the avenue have turned downstream uniformly, and the rising price of each commodity has stopped. However, the member stores of the general industry association, in view of the fundamental lack of goods at the bottom, generally do not endorse the opening of feather yarn serge. One is because the actual sales are continuing in season, the second is because the market goods are tight, and the third is because the tenants have limited supplies in their hands, so the trend is still firm. Yesterday, the first-class wholesale price of various colored stripes and plain feather yarn serge from the incoming road was 150 yuan per yard, the second-class was 125-6 yuan, the first-class product of this factory was 100 yuan, and the second-class was around 80 yuan.

### Jackfruit

— Gao Jianong

It is under the crown, those countless red and gorgeous bracts, purple-blue flowers, clustered together to form that fat and dense flower ball. The flowers are monoecious, the stamens are yellow, the ovary is inferior, and there are three chambers. After the pistil is fertilized, the ovary gradually swells, becomes fleshy, and finally all the ovaries are tightly combined together, so that it forms a round or oval fruit like a pine cone, about four or five inches long, initially green, and purple or yellow when ripe. This is the sweet and sour jackfruit with a special flavor that we usually eat. (To be continued)

Spring and Autumn

### Starting from Small Things

— Weimo

"Do not refrain from doing good deeds just because they are small" is a famous saying that teaches people to experience and practice every small thing. If a person can truly do everything, no matter how small, with determination and perseverance, the result will definitely be very good. Recently, I saw a truly "starting from small" thing on the streets and alleys. I might as well record it below to prove that what I said is not wrong.

Everyone knows that in Shanghai, where public toilets have not yet been widely established on the streets, the most annoying and helpless thing in the alleys is that everyone urinates everywhere. Not to mention that the ground is covered in "golden yellow" and "overflowing" odors, causing pedestrians to cover their noses and pass by. Even the walls are covered with various patterns, "calligraphy and paintings" are dazzling, and it is unbearable to look at, fully demonstrating the roots of filth and laziness. Moreover, once someone initiates this behavior, it is followed day and night, with the momentum of wearing through the doorsills (assuming there are any). This cannot be said to be a major stain on the city's appearance.

Recently, in a neighboring alley, a miracle was suddenly discovered. That old latrine from distant years was actually eliminated, and the time spent was not long, only three days. A dark and dirty place restored its original appearance of clean corners. From then on, pedestrians could conveniently walk there without having to hurry past.

How exactly was this done? Actually, it was very natural and simple. Since the establishment of the self-defense corps system, a post was set up at the entrance of the alley. A few young service personnel could not stand the fumigation of the stench, and it looked really unsightly. One afternoon, they made a decision to start from "small" things and worked hard in practice.

They carried a few buckets of clear water, prepared two bamboo brooms, and desperately engaged in flushing and sweeping work. Those yellow, long-standing stains attached to the walls could not resist the efforts of these young and strong individuals and gradually disappeared.

If this first step of rushing and washing work is done without practical supervision, then this hard work is still equivalent to doing it in vain. On the one hand, they posted warnings on the wall, prohibiting passers-by from conveniently going there again. On the other hand, they implemented close monitoring, so that people could not find a way to do it. For three consecutive days, the people coming and going, even those who were really in dire need, had to look away and leave, and find a proper place to solve it. Now it has been about ten days, and under constant sporadic flushing and strict supervision, this corner may be solved from now on, and will no longer be a place to hide dirt and harbor filth.

If everyone can make up their minds and start from small things, one corner will be recommended and extended to hundreds...thousands...millions...of corners, then the words "gentlemen respect themselves" and other similar sayings on the walls will surely be bid farewell to forever!

### Brothers Quarrel Within the Walls

— Jin Yi

The affection between brothers is as close as hands and feet; even if they are involved in litigation in public court due to unequal distribution of ancestral property, it is nothing more than a matter of a few coins. In the future, when each establishes their own household, what weddings and funerals will still be "under the same surname", harmonious as before?

However, after the case of a younger brother murdering his older brother occurred, news of an older brother shooting his younger brother followed closely. To put the other party to death, there should always be a world of grudges and hatred; but the former was simply because the older brother was unwilling to generously donate money; the latter was actually because of renting out a bedroom. Whether there are "unspeakable" secrets between them or not, we do not know, and we have no way of knowing; but we cannot think of a reason why one must kill a person - a brother as close as hands and feet.

The so-called "brothers quarrel within the walls" is just吵吵闹闹within the walls. Now it's "I want your life"!

### Live

— Qin Ren

Some say: Close your eyes!

Some say: Living one more day, after all, you see one more thing!

The former is passive, the latter is angry.

However, the latter still has the courage to live.

Since you have the courage to live,

It is better to firmly say that I want to live!

### Scarcity Increases Value

— Wang Ye

When foreign rice is one斗one圆, choose a store with good rice.

When foreign rice is five升one圆, any rice store will do.

When foreign rice is three升one圆, it is best to line up a little earlier.

When foreign rice is two升one圆, you have to get up in the dark!

When foreign rice is one升one圆, the whole bag is ready to go in the middle of the night!

Domestic rice is seventy or eighty yuan per 石, "No wonder people are搶米!"

Domestic rice is one hundred and several tens of yuan per 石, "So expensive!"

Domestic rice is two hundred and several tens of yuan per 石, "Really outrageous!"

Domestic rice is three hundred yuan per 石, "Quickly buy a few斗, it will rise again!"

Domestic rice is four hundred yuan per 石, "I have to buy a斗 even if I risk my life!"

### Sharing a Boat in Storms

— He Jia Zhi

(Two) Sadness and Joy

When Li Youxie went to see the coffin of Shu Yunji; he saw a piece of hemp nailed above the gate, like a horizontal banner, with lotus flowers cut out of white paper pasted on the hemp. He also saw people of all sizes standing in the patio, including Taoist priests, musicians, and temporary hired hands doing odd jobs. He pressed his hand and asked, "Where is A Xing?" He told A Xing to answer, "Uncle, I am here." Li Youxie said, "Go and invite the Second Madam out. I am in the Shuangmei Study; see if the eldest young lady is there, please invite her out too. Don't let your young master know, and don't let anyone else know." A Xing said, "A few female relatives have come, and the Second Madam is accompanying them and crying." Li Youxie glared and said, "You can't speak for her, you can't speak?" A Xing didn't say anything. Li Youxie first walked to the Shuangmei Study, closed the door casually, and sighed at the portrait of Ye Qingtang. He looked back and looked at the small broken glass frame on the skylight. He saw the Second Madam and the Eldest Young Lady were walking over, and hurriedly opened the door and beckoned them to come in. After protecting them both, he closed the door and said, "There is an important matter to discuss with you. One of you is Uncle Wei Cheng's wife, one is Wei Cheng's aunt, and I am Uncle Wei Cheng. The three of us agree first, and then let Wei Cheng know."

The Second Madam and the Eldest Young Lady were both at a loss, unable to guess what Li Youxie was going to say. They only heard him say, "I went to see the coffin, and it's still usable. But I met a person at Wei Yunqing's house. This person is called Qin Runzhi, and people sometimes call him Mr. Ninety-Three, meaning he knows everything about the nine streams and three religions. When I came back with Dou Wei Cheng, I met him on the road, and he greeted Wei Cheng. He advised me to handle the funeral slowly and do the happy event first." The Second Madam and the Eldest Young Lady were even more at a loss, and asked what it meant to do the happy event first. Li Youxie said, "He has his reasons. He said that my sister is dead, and there are only the Second Sister-in-law and Wei Cheng in the family; if Wei Cheng goes away to study, only the Second Sister-in-law will be left alone, which is quiet enough. It is better to put the funeral aside for the time being, put it aside for the day after tomorrow, and marry Wei Cheng a wife tomorrow. Marrying is a casual and disrespectful wedding. After marrying, the first thing is that there will be someone to cry for the mother-in-law; when sending out the obituary, we can add the name of a grandson, and the obituary will look better. He also said that it is a way to be flexible. It is certainly not good for a person to be too stubborn; it is not necessarily good to be too inflexible. Wei Yunqing listened and applauded. So I ran back to discuss with you." (Three Seven)
