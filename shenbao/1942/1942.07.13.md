Therefore, the Imperial Government has specially dispatched this envoy to return the visit. The Japanese envoys presented their credentials to the President of the Regency Council, who bestowed upon them sincere words. The envoy delegation felt honored and grateful. The people of Thailand have long admired peace and autonomy. In this corner of East Asia, they still maintain their glorious independence, and are striving to reform politics, develop the economy, and seek to enhance culture and prosperity. The envoy deeply admires Thailand's belief and determination in these efforts. The Imperial Government has always adhered to the national policy of stabilizing East Asia and establishing world peace, and has therefore decided to respect Thailand's independence and assist its development. At the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, Thailand provided various conveniences to the Imperial Army, and later concluded a mutual defense alliance with Japan, declaring war on Britain and the United States, and working together with Japan to strive for victory. This is deeply appreciated by the Imperial Government and people. Today, in East Asia, the power of Britain and the United States has been completely destroyed, and the establishment of a new order is unfolding step by step. In the future, we must continue to work tirelessly to overcome all difficulties and achieve the goals of the Greater East Asia War. The envoy deeply believes that the friendly relations between the two countries will become even closer.

The increased insurance premiums for each shipping route are listed below: From US ports on the Atlantic to ports in Brazil, an increase of 15% to 20%.

### Buenos Aires to Open Highway to US; Pan-American Agricultural Conference Passes Resolution

According to news obtained here, the Pan-American Agricultural Conference is currently being held in Mexico City.

Argentine expert Garcia strongly opposed this, arguing that Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay, etc. all have surplus flaxseed, which cannot be sold abroad due to a lack of transportation tools. If other South American countries, in addition to the above four countries, accept the US proposal, the result will inevitably lead to unnecessary competition, as oilseed production is already surplus.

### Swedish 5,000-ton Merchant Ship "Ulria" Sunk; Sixteen Crew Members Killed While Escorted by Warships After Being Torpedoed

Stockholm, 11th, Havas:

After two Swedish freighters were successively sunk by Soviet submarines, the Swedish envoy to the Soviet Union has been conducting ongoing negotiations with the Soviet authorities. The Swedish government also lodged a strong protest with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov on June 27. However, on the 9th of this month, another Swedish ship, the "Margareta," was torpedoed. Regarding this matter, the Swedish government does not intend to lodge another protest, as the only remedy is to implement naval escorts.

Stockholm, 11th, Havas:

A Swedish giant ship was torpedoed and sunk at 3:00 PM today in the waters near Västervik, Sweden. It has been confirmed that the ship was the 5,650-ton "Ulria," carrying iron and ore to Germany, and was escorted by warships. After being hit by a torpedo, it sank immediately. Details are unknown. It is also reported that another ship was also hit by a torpedo. Regarding the repeated sinking of Swedish ships by submarines of unknown nationality, TASS has issued a statement stating that Soviet submarines have never sunk Swedish ships. However, according to an announcement by the Swedish Foreign Ministry today, Soviet submarines actually broke through the mine defenses of Kronstadt Harbor in mid-June, which is a well-known fact. Although Soviet officials have only announced that Soviet submarines have sunk several German ships in the Baltic Sea, investigations have revealed that the submarines that sank the Swedish ships "Adalgosund" and "Carrigan 1" also had Russian names engraved on them. From this, it can be known that the ships that sank Swedish ships were all Soviet submarines. In the current environment, the captains of Soviet submarines are probably unable to maintain contact with the General Headquarters of the Red Army, so the headquarters is unaware of the situation. However, negotiations are still ongoing, and the Swedish government has taken all necessary military measures to protect Swedish shipping. In addition, the Swedish government issued a communiqué tonight stating that "of the 83 crew members of the Ulria, 16 were killed. At that time, the Swedish navy and air force fired on the attacking submarine. Afterwards, an oil slick was found on the sea surface, and the submarine is likely to have sunk."

### Turkish New Ambassador Postpones Trip to Soviet Union

### Soviet Semi-Official Admission of Serious Situation in the Don Region; German Mountain Warfare Division Enters the Donets Coal Basin

German War Headquarters, 12th, Havas: Today's German military report stated that the German infantry divisions on the southern front in Eastern Europe are closely pursuing the retreating enemy. Resistance has been crushed everywhere. Key facilities in Rostov and along the Caucasus coast have been bombed by German planes. Enemy troops northwest of Voronezh are attacking our positions in an attempt to reduce the pressure of the encirclement, but without success. 63 enemy tanks were destroyed by German planes and the army. North and northwest of Orel, enemy troops repeatedly pressed forward with infantry and tank formations, but were repelled. Enemy troops on the Voronezh front attempted to counterattack, but retreated with heavy losses. The Soviet Air Force lost 74 planes yesterday, and six German planes went missing.

Ankara, 12th, Havas: According to information here, Moscow semi-officially admitted yesterday, when assessing the situation in the Don region, that the situation for Soviet troops is extremely serious. Since the German army launched its offensive in Kursk two weeks ago, it has advanced on a 230-mile-long front. After occupying Rossosh, the German army is now attacking two points south of the city. Moscow also acknowledged that the German army has gained territory in the region.

Ankara, 12th, Havas: "Red Star," the organ of the Red Army, commented on the situation in the Don region yesterday, stating that Kantemirovka, 75 kilometers south of Rossosh, is about to fall. Soviet troops are holding the area "under unfavorable and difficult circumstances." The German army, having occupied Rossosh, is in an advantageous position. The newspaper hopes that the numerically superior German army in the Don region will not be deterred by the Soviet-built tank traps and landmines, and will continue to advance.

Berlin, 12th, Havas: Yesterday evening, German newspapers published a war dispatch from German reporter Tudt, stating that a division of German Alpine troops is now stationed in the Donets Coal Basin. This unit has special training in mountain warfare in order to participate in future battles.

German Army Uses New Weapons to Break Through Soviet Fortress Defenses

Berlin, 12th, Havas: The German High Command issued a statement yesterday on the battles on the southern front in the East, stating that "the pursuit of the enemy is ongoing." Military experts here paid close attention to the official German communiqué, believing that the German army and its allies had defeated General Timoshenko's army. The German military authorities often issue such communiqués after achieving the objectives of an offensive or when they are certain that they can achieve their objectives. In discussing future developments, military experts here pointed out that the Soviet army has built strong fortifications on the east bank of the Don River, the solidity of which is comparable to the Maginot Line. In this battle, the German army captured or destroyed over 1,000 Soviet tanks, as the German army used its new weapons. Most of the Soviet tanks were of the latest type and largest size, but they could not withstand a single shot from the German anti-tank guns, so the Soviet strength was insufficient to hinder the objectives of the German offensive, and these objectives could be fully achieved within the year. The Soviet report that General Timoshenko's army had retreated from the area between the Don and Donets Rivers is not true. Even if the Soviet army had this intention, it would have been annihilated by the rapidly pursuing German army.

Berlin, 12th, Havas: The German High Command issued a supplementary battle report yesterday stating that the number of enemy troops captured and the number of military supplies seized by the German army on the southern front in the East are continuing to increase. Due to the large quantity, they have not yet been fully counted. The strong and deep Soviet defense line, made up of chessboard shaped bunkers, were broken through in 12 days, and the flight of the enemy were given chase. The Soviet army only put up slight resistance at the river crossings, so that they could retreat as much as possible, but after days of German air and land attacks, the Soviet army was left with no organised fighting force. Northwest of Voronezh, the Soviet army launched repeated counterattacks on the 10th, but all were repelled.

### Egyptian Parliament Decides to Avoid War

Berlin, 11th, Havas: Official sources here stated that, according to news from Egypt, the Egyptian Parliament recently held a secret meeting and decided to do its utmost to prevent the Egyptian people from participating in the war. Although Britain has tried every means to induce Egyptian troops to fight alongside the British army, it has failed. In addition, news was received from the Bulgarian capital, that the Executive Committee of the Egyptian National Party has elected Yab to succeed after its Secretary-General, the former Finance Minister Obeid, was recently expelled from the party. However, 12 members of parliament from the party have expressed their joint solidarity with Obeid, announcing their resignation from the party and abandoning their political careers.

Ankara, 12th, Havas: Egyptian Prime Minister Nahas again met with King Farouk yesterday for a long conversation and reported on the situation to the King. It is understood that the central issue discussed at the Cairo meeting was how much of Egypt's property could be secured and protected from destruction by the British authorities if the British army withdrew from Egypt.

### Palestine: Ethnic Disputes Approaching the Boiling Point

Berlin, December 12th, Allied News Agency: According to news from Istanbul, following the Axis forces' advances in the Egyptian and Mediterranean theaters, the Palestine Jewish question has rapidly become serious, causing anxiety to the British authorities. The mutual hostility between Arabs and Jews in Palestine, which had seemed to subside under the careful control of the British authorities during the current war, is now certain to reach a breaking point. The number of Jews in Palestine has now increased to about 650,000. Two months ago, the British authorities prevented Jews from entering the area. According to news from Jerusalem, the British have lost their control after the withdrawal of the Ninth Army, leading to daily small-scale conflicts in the city. According to a broadcast from the Jerusalem radio station, the Jewish Council has resolved to request the British to establish a Jewish army to defend Palestine. However, the Arabs are doing their utmost to prevent the realization of this request.

### Australian Troops Arrive in Egypt to Join the Desert War; British Offensive Blocked on the Central and Northern Fronts; Italian Forces Launch Fierce Attacks on the Southern Front

Headquarters of the German Leader, December 12th, United Press: A German war report states that battles are still in progress within the territory of Alamein. German aircraft have bombed British positions and mechanized units with the heaviest bombs, causing extremely heavy losses to the enemy. German and Italian fighter groups shot down 14 enemy planes. The British air force base on the island of Crete has been repeatedly bombed.

Rome, December 12th, United Press: The Italian military headquarters announced this afternoon that enemy forces launched an assault on the coastal area of Alamein, and fierce fighting continues.

Fourteen British aircraft were shot down by Axis fighters. The island of Malta continues to be bombed. Facilities in Haifa, Venice, and Mikaba were the main targets of the attacks. Six British aircraft were shot down. Last night, British aircraft dropped some bombs near Catania and Seta on the island of Sicily, causing no damage.

Canberra, November 11th, Havas News Agency: Australian Prime Minister Curtin recently announced that Australian troops have now joined the battle on the Egyptian front. These troops have received training in desert warfare and are well-equipped.

Bangkok, December 12th, United Press: According to news from Canberra, Australian Prime Minister Curtin announced that Australian troops have arrived in Egypt to reinforce the British Eighth Army under General Auchinleck. He did not disclose the number of Australian troops arriving in Egypt.

Rome, November 11th, Havas News Agency: The Italian High Command announced this morning that fierce fighting has resumed in the Alamein area of Egypt. The enemy's fierce attack on our central front has been repulsed. The enemy's offensive on the northern front has also been contained by our forces. The battle situation is intense. On the southern front, our forces launched a surprise attack, forcing the enemy to retreat. Our 50th Regiment made a surprise raid on the enemy's rear, burning their supply depots. In addition, our air force shot down 17 British aircraft in aerial combat. Day and night, they repeatedly bombed Malta. Twelve British aircraft were shot down, and three of our aircraft failed to return to base.

Rome, December 12th, United Press: According to news received last night from the front lines, the left flank of the British defense line in Alamein has retreated to a new position after an attack by Axis forces. The British are setting up a semi-mobile defense line there. Their left flank protrudes too far forward. To prevent their flank attack, Axis forces are attacking their southern end, forcing them to retreat to a new position.

Valletta, November 11th, Havas News Agency: German and Italian aircraft bombed the island of Malta twice today.

Istanbul, December 12th, United Press: According to news from Jerusalem, an air raid alarm sounded in the port of Haifa yesterday morning. The enemy planes were repelled by anti-aircraft fire before they could drop any bombs.

Axis Gains in North Africa

Rome, December 12th, United Press: The Italian military newspaper summarizes the military gains of the Axis offensive in North Africa as follows: The North African battle line has shifted 555 kilometers eastward. A "military security zone east of the Libyan-Egyptian border" has been established. The "position of the Axis powers allows for an offensive against the Nile Delta." The strength of the British forces in the Near East has been greatly reduced. The British Eighth Army has lost 73,000 prisoners of war. In addition, 20 British bases in North Africa have been captured, and other important military equipment, water supply stations, repair shops, ports, and railway lines have been lost beyond measure. A 600-kilometer stretch of coastline in North Africa has fallen into the hands of the Axis powers, including the ports of Tobruk, Bardia, and Marsa Matruh. This greatly facilitates Axis shipping in the Mediterranean and the supply of Axis forces in North Africa. The port of Alexandria can no longer be used by the British as a naval base, so the remaining British fleet in the eastern Mediterranean has no suitable repair facilities. Egypt is no longer a safe rear area for the British army. Subsequently, British actions in Egypt can easily be detected by Axis aircraft. The prestige of the British in Egypt and other countries in the Near East and Middle East has suffered a great blow, which will have a significant impact on future British warfare. Subsequently, navigation through the Suez Canal and the eastern Mediterranean to Turkish ports is very dangerous. Goods supplied by Britain to Turkey will not be able to be transported, thus weakening British-Turkish relations.

### U.S. Military Officer Scott Stationed in Egypt Returns to Washington

### Belligerent and Neutral Nations Engage in Diplomatic Activities; All Seek to Adjust Political Stances; France Resolves to Uphold the Armistice Agreement

Vichy, November 11th, Havas News Agency: Political observers here recently commented that, in the past week, unprecedented battles have occurred on the Eastern Front and in North Africa. At the same time, diplomatic activities by belligerent and neutral nations have also increased, as they all seek to adjust their political stances. The most prominent among them is the Vatican. The Pope has always adopted a cautious attitude, avoiding entanglement in the vortex of war. In addition to engaging in wartime relief efforts, he is constantly urging belligerent nations to pay attention to their obligations when peace is restored in the future. In short, the political consequences of the current war, from the perspective of the Holy See, have greatly enhanced the prestige and status of the Vatican. Since the establishment of normal diplomatic relations between the United States and the Holy See in 1941, Japan and Finland have also successively sent envoys to the Holy See, which is clear evidence of this. In terms of the Middle East political situation, it has been greatly affected by the rapid advance of General Rommel. In particular, the Egyptian Nationalist Party has experienced infighting, making the British work in Egypt even more difficult. In addition, the leader of the anti-British faction in Jerusalem, the Grand Mufti, has recently been in Italy, extensively propagandizing to various Arab countries. Although the Pan-Arab movement has not yet fully matured or completely determined its course of action, it is already enough to make the British feel difficulties. Furthermore, the Axis powers have officially announced a promise that, once they occupy Egypt, they will respect the country's independence. This has created a new situation. King Farouk and his ministers are still ignoring the suggestions of Germany and Italy, but one thing is certain: the entire political situation in the Middle East will henceforth depend on military developments. France is directly related to all of the above issues. Several French warships are currently anchored in the port of Alexandria. If General Auchinleck is forced to retreat to the Nile Delta, the relations between Britain and France will become even more complicated. The French fleet is commanded by Vice Admiral Godefroy. When the Franco-German armistice agreement was signed, it was in the port of Alexandria. Subsequently, an agreement was reached with Britain, the so-called Godefroy-Cunningham Agreement. Although the ships have been disarmed, they still belong to the French Navy. There is no room for change in this status. Moreover, the armistice agreement has formal provisions on this matter, which both France and the Axis powers can adhere to. Since June 1940, no warship has been handed over to Germany or Italy. There is no reason for France to change this attitude in the future. Because of this, France has explained its position to the U.S. government. From Vichy's perspective, international concerns about this matter are nothing more than unnecessary worries. In short, France has explained its position on the French fleet stationed in the port of Alexandria to all countries in the world. In essence, it is acting entirely in accordance with the armistice agreement that it believes in and adheres to without change, and seeks nothing else.

### Public and Private Cars Suspended Nationwide in Brazil

### Arabia: Past and Present (6)

The Great Desert and the Great Plateau

The Arabian Peninsula, located between Persia, Syria, Egypt, and Abyssinia, is 1,500 miles north to south and 700 miles east to west. Most of it is desert, with little water and few trees. Shifting sands often engulf people and animals. The coastal area near the Arabian Sea is highland, rich in water and trees. This area is known as Happy Arabia. However, the rivers are still very short. The country of Yemen belongs to this region. Northern Arabia is mostly barren mountains and is known as Stony Arabia. However, it is a thoroughfare for east-west traffic. The country of Hejaz belongs to this region. The rest is called Desert Arabia, and the country of Nejd belongs to this region.

The Arabian Peninsula is one of the three major plateaus in Asia. This plateau slopes down towards the Persian Gulf. Although the entire island is dry and has little rain, oases exist everywhere, like small islands in the sea. The entire Arabian Peninsula is an environment isolated from the outside world, so its culture was not greatly influenced by the outside world before the rise of Muhammad. The oases on the Arabian Peninsula have the most pleasant scenery and are the foundation of Arab rural life. The Arab people who still have settled populations rely entirely on these oases and the fertile areas along the coast.

Arabia was anciently said to border five seas, but the coastline is simple and short. There are no good harbors for mooring except for Aden. The important cities on the Arabian Peninsula were naturally Mecca and Medina in the past, but now we must mention Riyadh, the capital of the former Kingdom of Nejd in the center of the desert. In addition, Sana'a is an important market south of the Red Sea coast and was where the old Turkish soldiers were stationed. Hodeidah is on the western coast and is a port for exporting coffee.

As for the climate of the Arabian Peninsula, it is in the tropics and has many deserts, so it is dry, hot, and unsuitable for life. The Red Sea coast is especially sultry, and living things cannot grow. Its barrenness and infertility are even worse than the Sahara Desert in Africa. Because of the high evaporation of the Red Sea and the lack of tides and rivers flowing into it, the salinity of the Red Sea is the highest.

The products of Arabia, with little cultivation in the oases, are best known for Arabian dates. Livestock includes horses and camels. Grapes, figs, coffee, and rubber are produced in the low-lying coastal areas on the east and west sides, and pearls are produced in the Persian Gulf area.

In terms of the political situation of the Arabian Peninsula, the northern part of the peninsula, originally called the Fertile Crescent, was the location of the ancient Babylonian and Assyrian empires. Now, they are tightly held by Britain and France under the name of mandated territories, surrounding Arabia in a semicircle. As for the coast of Arabia, it starts from the place where the Arabian Sea and the Red Sea meet. Aden fell into British hands early on. Proceeding east from Aden, places like Hadhramaut, Oman, Kuwait, and the Bahrain Islands have successively become British protectorates or spheres of influence. The Arabian Peninsula is like a pear, and the outer flesh, full of water and meat, has been gnawed away by others. The remaining sour and astringent core is left for the Arabs to gnaw on themselves.

What are the places that remain as this pear core? One is the Hejaz, close to the Red Sea, centered on Mecca. The other is the Nejd, located in the interior of the peninsula, centered on Riyadh. Now, Hejaz and Nejd have long been merged and renamed Saudi Arabia in 1934. Most of the Arabian Peninsula is considered unified, but the sour and astringent nature of this pear core still exists. The Hejaz is located in the southwestern part of the peninsula, with an area of 112,000 square miles and a population of 900,000. The cities of Mecca and Medina are both within this area. The city of Mecca has a population of 60,000, and Medina is slightly less, with 20,000. Both cities have great mosques. Medina has a railway connecting to the city of Damascus, which is 820 miles long and is the main route for Muslim pilgrims.

The area of Nejd is 170,000 square miles, the population is 2,000,000, and there are many oases within the territory, producing fruits, vegetables, coffee, and cotton. Famous horses are also produced in this region. Yemen is also an independent tribe in the southwest of the peninsula, adjacent to Aden, with an area of 75,000 square miles and a population of 2,500,000. There is a small resource within the territory called El Jebel, which is the most fertile place on the peninsula. Yemen has been called pro-Italian and was merged by Saudi Arabia six years ago. Kuwait is on the Persian Gulf, a military stronghold, with an area of 1,950 square miles and a population of 50,000. Before World War I, the terminus of the German 3B Railway was located here, and it produces pearls.

Oman is in the southeast of the peninsula, with an area of 82,000 square miles and a population of 50,000. The capital is Muscat. It became a British territory in 1891, and the British consul has great power. It is famous for producing camels.

Ibn Saud and Britain

After the Arab Empire split into three centers, it gradually declined. First, the Seljuk Turks rose, replaced the Arabs, and led the four religions. Later, the Mongolians controlled southern Asia, and the Seljuk Turks abdicated. Finally, the Ottoman Turks rose, took over the leadership of Islam, and continued to do so until now. As the Turkish Empire transformed into the Republic of Turkey, the leadership of Islam was voluntarily abandoned by the Turkish government. As soon as the Turks abandoned religious power, the Arabs rose up and wanted to reassert the old system of the Caliphate.

During World War I, the Arabian Peninsula, which was ruled by the Turkish Empire, and the Fertile Crescent to the north were restless and rose up against the power of the Sultan. Britain and France were active in this. At this time, the southern coast of the Arabian Peninsula had already fallen into the British sphere of influence. As the war became tense, Britain advanced into Iraq, the eastern end of the Crescent Land, controlling everything by force. On the other hand, General Allenby advanced from Egypt into Palestine and asked Hussein, the Sharif of Mecca appointed by the Sultan, to rise up in the name of a direct descendant of Muhammad and call on the Arab Muslims to resist the Turkish Sultan with the goal of Arab unification and nation-building. From here, they responded to Allenby's army and advanced to Asia Minor together.

### The Strange Scenery of Mecca

Everywhere in the holy city of Mecca, one can see balconies like the one in the picture, with strange architecture. When the scorching sun is in the sky, the shadows hang down, presenting the mysterious colors described in "One Thousand and One Nights." The passengers in the car in the picture are Muslim pilgrims who have come here. In 1926, Arabia had only four cars, but now it has hundreds. About 250 are for the use of the King of Arabia.

### Second Round of Grain Rationing Begins Today; 1.5 Sheng of Rice and 1.5 Jin of Flour Can Be Purchased for a Total of $7.50; Deadline is the 18th

The two concession authorities are implementing per capita grain rationing. The first round has ended, and taxpayers have complied with the regulations and received their rations, achieving effective results. The second round of grain rationing is approved to begin today. All 659 rice shops under contract will issue 1.5 sheng of white rice and 0.5 sheng of broken rice with the second coupon of the rice purchase certificate, plus 1.5 jin of flour, for a total cost of 7.50 Central Reserve Bank notes. It will be valid from today until the 18th. Certificate holders may go to purchase on any day within the period. Expired certificates will be declared invalid.

Rice Measured in Sheng, Flour Weighed in Jin

According to the regulations of the trade association, contracted rice shops will use the sheng dou to measure 1.5 sheng of white rice and 0.5 sheng of broken rice for the second round of household rations. The 1.5 jin of flour will be weighed in jin and liang. All certificate holders must bring their own cloth bags or utensils with capacity. If the purchaser believes that there is a shortage, they should immediately declare it and have it re-measured on the spot. The rice shops will not be responsible for claims of shortages after departure. At the same time, if any rice shop is found to be engaged in malpractice, the authorities will severely punish them upon investigation.

Third Round of Rationing Methods to Be Announced

The third round of household rations will be valid from Monday, July 20th, to Saturday, July 25th. Coupons from the third coupon of the rice purchase certificate will be used to purchase them. The quantity and price of rice and flour allocation will be announced by the authorities at that time. It is said that if there is still a surplus of household rations received by the rice shops by the deadline, it will be regarded as unsold inventory of the retailer. This inventory must be reported to the Rice and Grain Administration. After verification and approval, it will be allowed to be sold in the next period, but the price will be based on the amount announced by the authorities in the next period. Retailers may not sell or dispose of it privately. Violators will be fined ten times the price of the shortage of rice.

### Futures Trading Prohibited

Can Only Conduct Spot Transactions. Since the authorities have strictly cracked down on speculative underground transactions in the Shanghai market, the abnormal situation has gradually disappeared. It is learned that from today (13th), all markets in the city will be prohibited from futures trading. Only spot transactions of public bonds, stocks, yarn, and cloth can be conducted.

### Damaged Central Reserve Bank Notes Collected as Much as Possible; Cracking Down on Profiteering by Discounting

The Central Reserve Bank has promulgated regulations for the exchange of new notes for damaged banknotes. The bank has no restrictions on the exchange of damaged banknotes. If less than one-fourth of the banknote is damaged and the signature number is complete, the remaining amount will be exchanged. If more than one-fourth of the banknote is damaged and the signature number is complete, half of the amount will be exchanged. If it has been burned or water-stained and the signature number is complete and clear, it will be allowed to be exchanged with a guarantor. However, it will not be exchanged if less than one-half is damaged, or if it has been deliberately torn or pieced together. However, it is not appropriate for the market to refuse to accept slightly damaged banknotes. The person in charge of the bank issued a special statement yesterday, the main points of which are recorded below: Refusing to accept damaged banknotes is entirely a speculative and profiteering act, mostly controlled by money exchange shops. In order to stabilize the monetary system, banks and money shops should accept slightly damaged banknotes at face value and not discount them. The Central Reserve Bank has no restrictions on the collection and exchange of damaged banknotes. Citizens should accept damaged banknotes and they can exchange them for new notes at the Central Reserve Bank. Do not exchange them at small money shops to avoid losses. All Central Reserve Bank branches and offices will collect damaged banknotes as much as possible. A damaged banknote department will be set up in the Central Reserve Bank office in the French Concession Citibank branch for the convenience of general use. Old auxiliary banknotes will be used generally.

### Kidnapping Case of a Young Owner of a Flour Mill; Three Robbers Arrested

The Fufeng Flour Mill on Moganshan Road in this port was founded by Sun, a wealthy businessman from Anhui, with a capital of several million. During the war, the business made many times more profit. He used his own car for transportation. At 8:30 a.m. on September 12th last year, his son Sun Yichen, 19 years old, was riding his father's car to school when, near Tokyo Road in western Shanghai, five robbers pulled out handguns, stopped the car, fired warning shots, and kidnapped Sun Yichen to a robber's den in western Shanghai. They sent a letter demanding a large ransom. At that time, Sun's father had gone to another port. As a result, the family paid a ransom to release him, reportedly a huge sum. Recently, Chinese detectives Feng Baishun, Yang Yunfeng, and Guo Xiangyao of the Hong Kong Police Force, acting on a secret report, arrested the suspects Li Chunbao, Guan Shoushan (nicknamed Little Monk), Wang Maochang (also known as Little Sanzi), and suspects Xu Anren, a woman named Li Zhushi, and others in the southwestern part of Shanghai. They were sent to court for detention. The hearing was adjourned again yesterday because the victim and the kidnapped person did not appear in court for the two hearings. The hearing was postponed pending the arrival of the victim to testify. Xu Anren and Li Zhushi were released as they were not involved.

### In Memory of Madame Curie

— Diligent

Eight years ago at this time, a giant star fell in the scientific world – Madame Curie, the discoverer of radium, died! The sad news shook Poland, Europe, and every corner of the world.

Radium is a metal extracted from uranium ore. Several tons of uranium ore can only yield a few grams of radium. It is originally mixed with chlorine gas and another gaseous mixture, and can be separated by electrolysis. It requires a temperature above seven hundred degrees Celsius to dissolve. Radium has significant functions in medicine, used to sterilize, treat wounds, and fight cancer.

Madame Curie was born on November 7, 1867, in Warsaw, the capital of Poland, named Marie. In 1891, at the age of twenty-four, she met Pierre Curie, a graduate of the University of Paris, with a tall stature and brown hair, who was also engaged in electrical research. They fell in love at first sight and, after a short courtship, married in 1895.

In September 1897, Madame Curie gave birth to a daughter, named Irène. Less than ten days after childbirth, she returned to the laboratory to work. After two years of work, they extracted from uranium an element three hundred times more powerful than uranium, named Polonium. Subsequently, they extracted from polonium a steel-like substance, named Radium. This achievement did not satisfy them. They continued to experiment and finally discovered a new element in uranium in 1898 – radium. They publicly announced the results of their experiments, writing a thesis titled "Radiation Energy," explaining the properties and functions of uranium, polonium, and radium. This was the newest and most brilliant page in the history of science, instantly arousing worldwide surprise and admiration. Praise and honors flew to them. A few months later, they won the Nobel Prize in Science.

When World War I broke out, she trained one hundred technicians to use radium to treat wounded soldiers, benefiting 50,000 people. In 1922, American women raised 20,000 pounds to buy a gram of radium and present it to her. She went to the United States to accept this precious gift and brought it back to Paris. Not being a selfish person, she unhesitatingly donated it to a hospital specializing in the treatment of cancer, greatly facilitating the non-shallow Curie Madame. Madame Curie died eight years ago today in a small town near Sallanches in Haute-Savoie, France. The University of Paris specifically renamed the laboratory the Curie Institute to commemorate her contribution to humanity. At the same time, her daughter Irène continues her mother's unfinished aspirations, hoping to achieve further progress in radiation science.

### Real Estate Companies' Rent Collection Methods Awaiting Official Announcement Companies' Calculation Methods Vary

Datong News Agency reports that the English-language "The China Press" reports that Shanghai real estate companies are awaiting a decision from the Central China Liaison Department of the Asia Development Board regarding rent prices before collecting June rents. Most companies believe that it is inappropriate to urge tenants to pay rent before a decision is made.

Chinese Companies

Have Not Collected Rent

According to inquiries by reporters with Chinese business companies, a representative said that the company has not collected June rents because an agreement has not been reached with tenants regarding the conversion of rent units to Central Reserve Bank notes. He said that the company's supervisors are currently considering all aspects.

Increased Water and Electricity

Heavier Burden

He continued that some real estate companies have already asked their tenants to pay Central Reserve Bank notes calculated at a 6.6 exchange rate, but this is not enough to compensate for the increase in all expenses. Some smaller real estate companies have even charged rent at a one-to-one exchange rate or at a 25% discount.

Another Company

Different Attitude

According to our observations, the attitude of the Xin Kang Company is very different from that of the Chinese Business Company. Yesterday, a representative of the company revealed that the company has already collected most of the June rents, and the method of calculating rent collection is to collect Central Reserve Bank notes according to the original amount of old currency.

Awaiting Reasonable

Announcement of Methods

Similar to the Zhengxing Chinese Business Company, the Xin Kang Company is currently awaiting a decision from the Asia Development Board, but the company has pre-collected rent while still awaiting the announcement of a more reasonable method. Some tenants' rents were originally very high and are now requesting to pay rent at a 6.6 exchange rate. Some have agreed to a 7.5 calculation, but some are calculating at a one-to-one rate.

### Water Outage in Haifang Village Tenants Demand Restoration

Due to a dispute over the cost of the motor for the artesian well in Haifang New Village on Haifang Road, the landlord demanded that the tenants bear the cost unsuccessfully, resulting in the artesian well being closed since the day before yesterday, and only open for one hour each morning, causing the tenants to suffer from water outage. During this hot weather, it is especially harmful to hygiene. Therefore, in order to seek compromise, the tenants elected Zheng Zhenwan and Shi Huanzhang as representatives yesterday to go to the Tong surname landlord on Maiter Hesters Road to demand the restoration of water supply, willing to bear half of the total electricity bill in proportion with the landlord. Unexpectedly, the landlord was still unwilling to compromise, insisting that the tenants bear the entire cost, resulting in no results. Last night, the tenants were discussing countermeasures.

### Providing Funds with Commodity Guarantees Banks and Firms Stipulate Loan Methods Loans Granted to Those Who Pass Audit Must Be Paid with General Allocation Notes with Specially Established Methods as Necessary Conditions for Loan Issuance

After the United Association of Money Lenders strictly handled mortgage loans in accordance with the promulgated "Regulations on the Prohibition of Loans with Commodity Guarantees," banks and firms shall, for loans providing funds with commodities as guarantees, establish contracts with companies, factories, and firms (i.e., pledgors) that have passed the audit and are approved for loans, in accordance with the methods stipulated by the industry association, stating the name of the pledged items, the documents of the pledged items, the document numbers, weight, content, market price, total market value, the above-listed goods, calculated at the total market value, at a certain discount for a pledged price of a certain amount of yuan. The mortgage loan shall be paid in Central Reserve Bank notes with full market value. In addition, 21 methods are stipulated as necessary conditions for loan issuance. The term and interest rate shall be negotiated by the pledgor and each bank or firm. However, the term shall be limited to a maximum of three months. According to the regulations, when the term expires, the pledgor shall fully repay the principal and interest of the loan and advanced expenses without delay upon notification from the pledgee. When the price of the pledged items falls or is about to fall, the investor shall increase the goods. At the same time, the pledgor shall seek a reliable guarantor to issue a guarantee letter and jointly assume responsibility with the pledgor, so as to be solemn and avoid abuses.

### Nephew Deceives Uncle Hoarding Goods Swallowed

Zhang Hongye, who lives in Room 514, No. 349 Ningbo Road, purchased one hundred pieces of Lixin Factory's Carp Star brand indigo blue cloth worth tens of thousands of yuan. His nephew, Qian Yuxiu, who works at the Xun'an Transportation Company in Yingchunfang, Hubei Road, knew that his uncle had the above goods and told Zhang that if this cloth could be transported to Jinhua, it would fetch a good price. He could be responsible for transportation and sales. Zhang believed him and entrusted the Xun'an Company to transport it to Jinhua on March 28 of this year, paying a freight fee of 10,000 yuan, with a deadline of 35 days. Unexpectedly, after the deadline, there was no news. Zhang inquired with the company, but they were always vague. Zhang sent someone to Jinhua to investigate and found that the above goods were not transported to Jinhua at all, and had been sold off and the money embezzled. Zhang believed that Qian Yuxiu, as his nephew, should not engage in such deception, truly fulfilling the saying "betraying one's uncle," and reported it to the Lao Zha Police Station. Chinese detective Li Pengfei arrested Qian, and the company's manager Zhuang is still at large. The case was sent to the court for interrogation and is awaiting further verification.

### Dacheng Middle School Relieves Students Out of School

The private Dacheng Middle School at No. 146 Hartung Road was founded by some faculty and staff from the former Xin Jian Middle School.

### Tram Ride Notes

— Meng

Before the war, there were not so many iron gates around the concessions, nor was there a ban on walking after 12 o'clock at night with a pass. The citizens were eating Du rice for less than ten yuan a stone, the world was peaceful, and their spirits were good. They were very enthusiastic about the seasonal and trendy things. For example, spring is intoxicating, and the Longhua peach blossoms are a must-see. In the crisp autumn season, horseracing at Jiangwan Yinxiang Port is the most fashionable entertainment. In summer, there are even more fun things, such as the Gaohang seaside bath, cool ferry rides, and car rides, which were especially popular for a while. At that time, there was a lot of talk about building a Greater Shanghai, and the roads were accessible in all directions. For a few dollars, a car would take you speeding along the long asphalt roads, with a cool breeze blowing in your face, and the air in the suburbs was fresh. You felt refreshed and felt that this was an inexpensive way to relieve the summer heat.

As for reporters, they are especially fascinated by this thing. Once, I was so happy to go for a ride that I forgot the distance and accidentally strayed into the cordon, and was detained overnight by the Wusong Fort Command along with the car. Another time, also late at night, the car passed through Beixinjing, and suddenly I had the whim to go to pay tribute to the site of the famous prostitute Wang Lianying's death, which almost caused a car accident. Despite the constant encounters with accidents, my interest in taking a ride has not waned to this day.

But, what is the current objective environment like? The area for citizens to move around is pitifully narrow, cars have become a means of transportation for special classes, and life is so difficult. Therefore, there is no chance to go for a ride!

This summer, Shanghai is particularly hot. The headlines in the newspaper once read "The whole city is boiling." The threat of heat waves is serious. With compassion for others and to make up for my own regrets, after much hard work and thought, I invented a new method of taking a tram ride to relieve the summer heat. I dare not keep it secret and am willing to share it with the four million citizens. Or, if you suspect that I am attracting business for the tram company, you are betraying a good heart!

Based on field research, there are two tram ride routes: one is Route 1 of the Public Concession, from Jing'an Temple to Park Bazichang; one is Route 2 of the French Concession, from Xujiahui to Shiliupu. Both of these routes are more than ten miles long, and it takes about an hour to travel one way. According to a car ride, it used to cost three yuan an hour. Although the tram has increased in price several times, the full fare for the above two lines is only seven cents, which is economical and affordable. We know that Shanghai is a coastal city with a marine climate. Therefore, despite the "boiling" of the whole city during the day, there is always a cool breeze in the evening. We must pay attention to the time when we take the tram ride. Based on the above reasons, choosing the evening is a matter of course. After 10 o'clock in the evening, the vehicles from west to east are most suitable. One is that there are few passengers at that time, and the car windows are wide open. Maybe the driver sells tickets and you only have four or five people. The second is that there is often a southeast wind in summer, and the car travels against the wind, and the wind is even more powerful. You step into the east compartment, there is no need to be polite, quickly take the lead and occupy the two corner seats in the back. Fortunately, there are not many passengers, and the sitting posture can be more casual. One elbow is placed flat on the window sill, and the body does not have to be upright, about 45 degrees from the backrest. It is also necessary to light a cigarette in the corner of the mouth. In this way, you have the best of the time, the place, and the people. The car turns from Jing'an Temple into Avenue Road. There are more stops in this section, and the street scene is not very good. You may feel bored, but don't be disappointed. This is just a short journey. After passing Carter Road, there is a gradual sense of improvement. The streets are gradually widening, the speed of the car will also increase, and the enjoyment of the wind will definitely satisfy you. From Mahoff Road, the Racecourse is on the right, and Parker Road is on the left. The terrain is natural, the ground is wide and the wind is strong. It is a cool place, and the pleasure of the ride is most excellent here. After this, it is generally believed that the splendor returns to plainness, but it is not! When the car is approaching the Bund, the Huangpu River is no different from a large bellows, and Nanjing Road is like a ventilation pipe of the large bellows. A gust of headwind suddenly makes you feel comfortable. To use drama as a metaphor, this is the last climax of the whole journey, and the ride is then End "finished".

Someone asked: Route 1 tram has now reached Hongkou, what is the flavor there? The Analects say: Knowing is knowing, not knowing is not knowing. I have not been there, so I can hardly speculate, but I think it is also good.

### Reality Is Far From Ideal The Future of the Insurance Industry Is Worrisome

No one has failed to notice the newly opened insurance companies in the past six months, which are like mushrooms after rain. Because people generally estimate that the suspension of foreign insurance businesses will free up at least 60% to 70% of business, which can be given to other insurance businesses. Moreover, the insurance business has generous profits. According to general estimates, at most 20% to 30% of the 100% business has compensation risks, so 70% to 80% interest is a sure thing that can be steadily earned. In addition, prices have been soaring in recent years, and the amount insured can be increased proportionally, and the insurance business can continue to expand with the continuous development of prices. Therefore, old companies are expanding their business, and new companies are vying to set up shop. Now, although people are still eager to try, those in the know already have a sense of confusion about advancing or retreating. Because:

First: Most of the insurance business operated by foreign companies in the Far East is marine insurance and fire insurance, but it is mostly reinsurance of Chinese merchants, and there is not much direct underwriting. Now that foreign trade has stopped, marine insurance business cannot be started. Therefore, the business freed up by the suspension of foreign insurance companies is unexpectedly small.

Second: The call for price control is rising. What will the future be like? Although it is difficult to predict, as far as the current situation is concerned, the kind of skyrocketing situation in the past will not be repeated. And the hope of seeking proportional development of the insurance business by relying on rising prices will also be dashed, at least it will be greatly reduced compared to the past.

Third: The more goods hoarded, the more hope there is for the development of the fire insurance industry. However, with the crackdown on hoarding and the fundamental decline in the source of materials, the materials accumulated in this street may only decrease day by day in the future. It is unimaginable to hope that it will increase. Then, the future of the entire fire insurance business is also difficult to be optimistic about.

Fourth: Operating the insurance business had two advantages in the past. One is the full collection of fees, and only bears 20% to 30% of the compensation risk; this is the benefit of the insurance business itself. The other is that huge amounts of funds are concentrated, which can be used for hoarding and other speculations, and investment benefits can also be obtained. Now that hoarding is an example of crackdown, other speculative opportunities are decreasing day by day. Therefore, the use of funds is not as profitable as it used to be.

The future of the insurance business is bleak this time, but the invested capital has been spent on the excavation costs of the house and daily expenses. What to do?

### Market Trends

Chinese Stocks

The market environment remains favorable for Chinese stocks. Last week, the stock prices of various companies continued to rise without any declines. Zhabei Water & Electricity and China General Edison, generally regarded as the equivalent of the "96 Public Bonds" in the Chinese stock market, experienced particularly sharp increases due to rumors of a merger with China Water.

Among the stocks that showed the greatest upward momentum last week, Zhabei Water & Electricity and China General Edison stood out. Recalling that a year ago, they were only around 3.4 yuan, they have now increased more than tenfold. Even the most rapidly rising commodities would probably pale in comparison. However, these are not the only Chinese stocks whose market prices have risen tenfold in the past year; Great China Match, Wing On Company, Sincere Company, and Wing On Textile Factory can also be compared. Remarkably, these stocks still had the potential for continued growth last week.

Public Bonds

The fluctuations in various bonds last week were relatively even, with daily changes of no more than five or six jiao. However, the gains from the third and fourth weeks of the past had completely disappeared, reverting to the state of more than a month ago.

Lowest Price on June 11th     Highest Price in One Month     Lowest Price on July 11th
Unified A     4.00     45.50     39.20
Unified B     4.07     44.40     33.70
Unified C     41.00     44.00     33.54
Unified D     38.00     41.80     33.30
Unified E     89.00     43.00     33.37

Yarn Market

The prices of cotton yarn and cloth rebounded after the customs closure. By Wednesday of last week, the surge was even more intense, as if the reasons for the previous sharp decline had been forgotten. However, without eliminating the root of the problem, it is difficult to prevent the activities of speculators. Therefore, there was a move to close the factory bill market last Saturday. However, the spot market still adopts a self-governance system. It is reported that the guild has drafted official prices and is submitting them to the relevant authorities for approval. Based on these proposed prices, there is still a need to reduce the market price by 70-80%.

Sugar and Oil

The sugar and oil markets have long been subject to control through agreed prices. The price of oil increased twice in ten weeks. Raw oil is now sold at 129.5 military yuan per dan (it was 107.5 yuan before June 10th; after the 10th, it increased to 109.5 yuan until now). Refined oil is now sold at 124.5 military yuan per dan (it was 102.5 yuan before June 10th; after the 10th, it increased to 104.5 yuan until now). Clear oil, rapeseed oil, sesame oil, etc., have also increased by more than 20%.

The agreed price of sugar also increased twice last week. At the beginning of July, coarse white sugar increased from 71 yuan per dan to 74 yuan; last week, it increased by another 4 yuan to 78 yuan. Dutch red sugar increased from 66 yuan to 69 yuan; last week, it increased by another 4 yuan to 73 yuan.

In the past, these changes would inevitably have caused a significant stimulus to the general commodity market. However, today, due to the increasing efforts to manage prices, it is impossible to follow, and it continues to decline, which is gratifying.

Western Medicine

According to this publication's investigation of ten kinds of Western medicine, the market situation was generally sluggish or unchanged last week. Due to the influx of Japanese products, Sumida caused prices to collapse.

### Random Notes from Outside the Market

Zhenhua Coal Company, No. 31, Joffre Road, this year, under the guise of registering coal briquette users, went around soliciting customers and issuing warehouse receipts. At that time, there was a severe coal shortage, so many people purchased them, absorbing a large amount of cash. Now, because the market price of coal briquettes has doubled, they are notifying customers that they have no goods to deliver and are refunding the deposit at a rate of two to one, even resorting to declaring liquidation in the hope of shedding debt. This has caused great losses to those who hold the company's warehouse receipts. It is reported that they have designated Post Office Box 4013 in this city as a joint communication point for discussing countermeasures. Issuing empty warehouse receipts is inherently illegal, but in recent years, it has become commonplace. However, only speculative banks and yarn shops have sold short first and then tried to escape later. This is a new idea in the coal industry. If this trend is not investigated, it will inevitably spread to merchants in various industries, who will follow suit. We hope that the authorities will pay attention to this.

The regulations of the banking industry prohibit commodity mortgages lasting more than three months, which means that commodity mortgages within three months are not subject to the ban. Based on this principle, when the Public Works Department cracks down on hoarding merchants, will it also be necessary to investigate whether the hoarding period has exceeded three months?

### Gray Days

— Guo Jiaji

People are already familiar with the changes in the natural world's climate. Sometimes the sky is clear and the air is fresh, sometimes there are violent storms, sometimes the heat is oppressive, sometimes the cold is piercing, sometimes the wind is gentle and the sun is beautiful, and sometimes the sky is dim. Everyone does not find these strange, considering them to be a matter of course.

However, many people cannot deal with the changes in the world with the same calm mind. They become ecstatic when successful, discouraged when they fail, cheer when things go smoothly, and worry when they encounter setbacks. In fact, the changes in the world are often not much different from the climate. Just as there is always a clear and sunny day after a violent storm, failure is not permanent if there is a firm will and determination to persevere to the end.

The great German medical scientist Ehrlich declared a deadly battle with the syphilis bacteria at the beginning of the 20th century. Initially, he suffered 605 failures, and it was not until 1910 that he achieved success with 606. His success became a major revolution in medicine. However, he believed that this drug had not yet reached a satisfactory level, so he continued to experiment, suffering another 307 failures, until the 308th time, when he finally achieved success and completed the 914 experiment.

When Ehrlich encountered one failure after another, those days were truly a series of gray days, but he had a firm belief, he knew that the light was behind him, and after his persistent efforts, when these gray days passed, what followed were the bright and happy days of success.

Therefore, if we have a firm will and confidence, and use a calm mind to overcome the gray days of failure, the gray days will surely pass, and the bright days of success will come.

### Worries About Life

— Dangdong

The semester has ended. Summer vacation is about to begin. The children are all filled with joy, looking forward to the arrival of summer vacation, so that they can have fun. However, as a teacher, I have a completely different feeling from them: not the joy of being able to get a long rest, but a layer of worry covering the depths of my heart. The end of the semester seems to be urging my life; "How will I spend the more than a month of summer vacation?" This has become the most anxious problem for me. The degree of this anxiety increases as the end of the semester approaches, making me afraid to imagine it.

The monthly salary is so meager and pitiful that it is impossible to talk about any special enjoyment, and even the minimum level of enjoyment cannot be satisfied, so naturally there is no question of saving. In this way, during the long summer vacation, I will inevitably have to let my stomach take a "long rest." Thinking of this, it only increases the anxiety and uneasiness in my heart.

Ah! The children feel so happy and fascinated by summer vacation, but what about myself? I dare not think any further.

Since stepping into the gate of this school and beginning my teaching career, and forming an unbreakable bond with chalk and red ink, I have deeply felt the heaviness and distress of this life; so heavy that I doubt whether I am working in an educational institution or serving hard labor. Whether it is morning or night, I rarely leave my desk, and my hands are always on the red pen, my eyes are always on the books, or I am shouting at the top of my voice. Although the work is so intense and busy, the only comfort I get is the children's noise, drinking some thin porridge, and gnawing on a few dried radishes. Because of excessive fatigue and malnutrition, I have become much thinner, and I cannot help but wonder if I have lung disease and feel possible terror. Therefore, this kind of resentment of despising my incompetence and hating society arises involuntarily. At the same time, I am often filled with the thought: "Aren't there many ways to make money? Why suffer here?"

However, when the anger dissipates and reason returns, I calm down and think silently; how difficult this era is, and how many people have been excluded from the job market and are suffering from the whip of life. Being able to occupy this position is a very fortunate thing! At the same time, after realizing the meaning of the sentence "The responsibility of a teacher is great," I feel a satisfied smile.

At this time, no one should have extravagant enjoyment. Teachers naturally should not and, in fact, cannot have luxurious enjoyment, but the maintenance and guarantee of the minimum standard of living is a matter of course and must be obtained. However, I have to ask the following question with a trembling voice: "Can I continue in the next semester?" This is another major worry for me. Does anyone say this is unnecessary worry? But it is not at all! The increase in prices is faster than lightning. In order to improve the lives of teachers and enrich the school's expenses, the increase in tuition fees in the next semester will be at least more than double the previous amount. This has become an unavoidable fact. Increasing tuition fees and raising teachers' salaries is certainly a gratifying thing for teachers, but behind the joy lies infinite distress, which is the inevitable result of a sharp reduction in the number of students caused by the large increase in fees. The school's income is not increased compared to before, and in order to save expenses, a set of school affairs adjustments will be made, and major changes will be made in personnel. Therefore, the sad scene at the end of each semester in the past secretly captures my heart. In the past, I expressed deep sympathy and regret to those unfortunate colleagues, but now, I feel anxious and disappointed about my possible unfortunate experience!

### The Uncrowned King

— Xiao Nai

4.  The Great Era

Honestly, we deserve to be proud. In the middle of these 70 or 80 years, China's journalism has been nurtured and grown, especially in the last ten years. We have seen so much and experienced so much personally. It is truly a great era. Historians handling historical materials from this period must not ignore the past. Journalists have undertaken a work of struggle and reporting, which can provide great help to future historians. And perhaps a lifetime of effort at one's post will leave indelible marks. From the perspective of work, the complexity of the task and the length of time, compared with what the senior gentlemen of decades ago called "a small room, a lone lamp at night, two or three like-minded people, patting the table and talking," is simply unimaginable. We write in a state of tension, and can only appreciate the poetic mood of "a lone lamp on a long night," and dare not hope for this kind of unrestrained and leisurely artistic conception. Furthermore, from the perspective of meaning, how fortunate we are to be born in this era, to have obtained precious and outstanding realities, and to have endured unprecedented experiences, plus the hardships of life, we believe it is worthy of pride to move forward under these whips.

Journalists often keep pace with the times, understand the times, and especially need to understand cause and effect. Everything must have a cause, and then there is a result. Cause and effect circulate and depend on each other. The result obtained today must be the cause planted in the past; further, the result obtained today may be the cause planted in the future. The various news we see every day sometimes seems unremarkable, because understanding cause and effect allows us to predict how it will develop in the future. Take the current situation, for example, speculation is enough to stimulate rising prices. When the speculative market is filled with smoke and miasma, the lives of ordinary people are very harmed. Someone once predicted that speculation would inevitably disappear one day, and indeed it has now reached this point. This is the cause planted in the past, and the result obtained today. This is a very simple example, and other various things can be extended in this way. Journalists work in this churning of cause and effect, and big or small, far or near, nothing can escape this law. If you study it from the perspective of a philosopher, you will feel that it is very small and does not need to be discussed.

Some people say that journalists can do some things and cannot do others, sometimes they can, and sometimes they cannot. When they can, people are often happy and amazed, and when they cannot, people are truly disgusted. In fact, the journalists themselves have never changed, they are the same from beginning to end. We take the position of "lowly without being humble" and say honestly that journalists can "do" and are not "unable to do," it just depends on how they "do" it.

We believe that journalism is an ordinary profession, very simple. You only need to do it within the scope of your duties, do not get involved in external affairs, and you will definitely do well. We do not want to enjoy a life of luxury, we do not envy lofty power, our scope is very wide, and the places where we can serve are also very extensive. We try our best to make our thoughts and actions simple, and we will definitely be able to contribute our meager strength in this great era.

The so-called three thousand Mausers, the so-called uncrowned kings, also exert their power from simple thoughts and simple actions. We must face reality with a relentless spirit, and do the newspaper for the sake of doing the newspaper, then after many experiences and many lessons, there will inevitably be a day of bitterness giving way to sweetness.

Medicine

### Terrible Cholera

— Su Fusheng

Recently, cholera (i.e., cholera) has become prevalent again in the Nanshi and Zhabei areas. This often occurs in the summer in densely populated cities that have suffered from war and disasters. In addition, the high cost of living and the lack of nutrition among residents weaken the body's resistance, making them susceptible to infection with even slight dietary indiscretions. Cholera is transmitted very quickly, with very little natural immunity, and the mortality rate is about 50%. Delay in treatment often leads to death.

Cholera is endemic in India. It was very prevalent in our country in 1932. The disease is transmitted by a type of cholera vibrio, shaped like a ",". It exists in sewage and the feces of patients. The bacteria can be killed in five minutes when exposed to moist heat at 80 degrees Celsius, or after one hour of exposure to sunlight, but they are very resistant to cold. They can live for several days in feces and for several weeks in seawater.

Cholera bacteria can be transmitted when brought down through the mouth through diet. However, these bacteria fear acid, and are often killed by stomach acid when they pass through the stomach. If they pass through the stomach and reach the intestines, they can rapidly reproduce and cause lesions in the small intestine. After an incubation period of one or two days, the patient suddenly experiences vomiting and diarrhea, excreting rice-water stool. The patient loses water, the calf muscles spasm, the abdomen and eye sockets sink, the limbs are cold, the skin on the fingertips is wrinkled (commonly known as "butterfly claws"), the mind is unclear, the face is pale, and urination decreases. Eventually, the heart weakens, water is lost, and the patient dies of collapse. In rare cases, there is no vomiting or diarrhea, which is called dry cholera, and death is caused by poisoning.

Because the bacteria fear acid, in addition to early injection of cholera vaccine, a few drops of oxalic acid water or lemon water can be taken daily to kill the bacteria. In addition, attention should be paid to overall nutrition to increase resistance, keep bowel movements smooth, eliminate flies and insects, and ensure that food is clean and boiled before eating. Isolation from patients and their housemates is also very important. Cholera patients may continue to excrete cholera bacteria in their feces for several weeks after recovery. And the patient's housemates can also retain the bacteria. These carriers are often overlooked, but they are the easiest to infect. As for preventive injections, there is only a six-month immunity period, so you cannot assume that you can skip the injection this year because you had a vaccination last year, or that you have natural immunity and treat your life as a child's play.

In epidemic areas, a 5% solution of carbolic acid, mercuric chloride solution, or hydrochloric acid solution should be used for disinfection. The patient's excrement can be disinfected with carbolic acid solution. Rivers and wells that residents in rural areas rely on for drinking water can be slightly bleached (containing chlorine) for disinfection to prevent a small spark from starting a prairie fire.

### Father-Son Bicycle

— Zhang Qiao

Last time, this publication introduced a five-person bicycle. Today, I will introduce another type of father-son bicycle. Although it is a variation of a tandem bicycle, its structure is quite novel and worth a laugh. Its place of origin is Australia, where the situation is urgent. The rear seat of the father-son bicycle is lower than the front seat, and is specially designed for children. Therefore, the "son" in this father-"son" must not only be a son, but also a child. It won't work if they are older. There are also two sets of pedals. The child only helps by stepping on the pedals, and the real driving work is independently borne by the adult in the front seat. The most novel thing about this car is that the front and rear wheels are not equal in size. The diameter of the rear wheel is only half the diameter of the front wheel. It would be great to have one of these in the family. Isn't it fun for father and son to be in the same car?

### Sharing the Same Boat Through Storms

— He Jiazhizhi

7.  Thunderbolt

Weicheng's appetite, according to Cuizhen's observation, has decreased again. In the eighth month of the lunar calendar, just when Guofang said that the second half of the year would begin, Weicheng began to stretch his neck again, waiting for letters from Guofang or Guoqi. The trees around Shidetang, how lovely the green leaves grow, cicadas, mantises, and other small lives spend half their lives in this lovely color. At night, the fireflies and mosquitoes in the green grass piles are still active when the weather is sultry. Cuizhen specially lit locally made green wormwood sticks for him, because one couldn't buy mosquito coils made of pyrethrum in the countryside. There was one in the Shuangmei Study and one in his bedroom.

During a long hot summer, Li Youxie came, and Zhou Xingfu also came. One was Weicheng's uncle, and the other was Weicheng's uncle-in-law. They were both concerned about how Weicheng was doing at home observing mourning. They all said that Weicheng had lost weight, and the second Mrs. Ye was a little worried, so she instructed Cuizhen to persuade Weicheng to go to Shanghai for a visit. Weicheng didn't like this advice. Instead, he shook his head and said slowly, "People don't even give me a letter. I wrote a letter and they didn't reply. What am I going to do to visit them? Of course, it's best not to go." These words were like answering Cuizhen, and also like talking to himself. Cuizhen said, "Brother Cheng, if you don't want to go, then don't go, why are you acting resentful? Second Auntie sees that you've been unhappy these past few days, and is afraid that you'll get sick from worrying." Weicheng said, "Even if I get sick from worrying, no one will know." Cuizhen said, "Oh dear, that's not good. I wanted to persuade Brother Cheng not to worry, but now Brother Cheng has added some worries. Let's not talk about it, let's not talk about it. Brother Cheng, look at your books." Cuizhen walked out of the door, slowed her footsteps, and pricked up her ears to listen to whether Weicheng had any more self-talk. At first, she heard nothing. Then, she heard Weicheng reciting poetry. She smiled slightly, ran to the room, and looked in the mirror to see how happy her face was. She opened her mouth to look at her teeth, and brushed her hair to look at her eyebrows. Both her eyebrows and her teeth showed joy. In her ears, she seemed to hear the footsteps of magpies, and she was startled. The startle was a reaction to joy. Why was she joyful? Only Cuizhen herself understood. (126)
