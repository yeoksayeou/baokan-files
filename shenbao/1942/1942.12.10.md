### Provisions

Provisions! The most serious problem in Shanghai at present—

The problem of provisions is increasingly affecting the lives of the people day by day. Today, everyone urgently feels that the problem of provisions needs to be resolved quickly and appropriately.

In the case of Shanghai, it was not the most grain-deficient area in the past because it was surrounded by rice-producing regions. In addition, its convenient transportation meant there was no need to worry about a shortage of rice. The concern in the past was about rice merchants hoarding and manipulating market prices, increasing the burden on people's lives, and creating social unrest. However, the situation is different now. The authorities have implemented a rationing system for civilian rice according to a unified plan. Therefore, the current severe rice problem is completely different from the rice shortage and skyrocketing rice prices of the past!

To what extent is the current rice problem serious? In terms of the actual rice consumption of ordinary citizens, they receive household rice under the rationing system, with each person allowed to buy 1.5 *sheng* every ten days (approximately 1 *sheng* of rice, 0.5 *sheng* of broken rice, and 1.5 *jin* of flour). On average, each person can buy 1.5 *he* of rice and a little over 2 *liang* of flour per day. According to the general physique of the Chinese people, each person needs to eat at least 0.5 *sheng* of rice per day, and no less. Therefore, according to the current rationing system, the household rice they can receive is at most only half of what they need. As for whether the price of rice matches their income, no rigorous comparison has been made! So, how do the citizens of Shanghai maintain their lives? It goes without saying that the extremely poor are struggling on the brink of life and death. The rest, who can barely support themselves, can only buy small amounts of rice from street vendors in addition to receiving relatively cheap household rice, but ××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××. Such an increasing number will not only threaten the lives of Shanghai citizens, but of course, it will also affect the future of society.

Because the alarming increase in rice prices has real implications! This seriousness was not felt in the past. In the past, the rise in rice prices did not have a widespread impact, primarily because almost every household in Shanghai had stored rice last year. They could ignore the high rice prices and take each day as it came. This is no longer the case. The rice reserves of the people of Shanghai have long been exhausted. Secondly, in the past, when Shanghai was short of food, it could be supplied from the surrounding countryside. However, there are now restrictions, and there have been these new changes in the source of supply; there is almost little hope for a reduction in rice prices. However, the actual income of the general public in Shanghai cannot fully solve the problem of living:

First, as mentioned above, household rice only meets half of the people's food needs. The other half has to be purchased at high prices on the black market. Calculated at yesterday's market price, for example, a family of four, with two adults and two children, would spend at least ten yuan or so per day on rice alone! Given the employment situation of the general public in Shanghai, no one can afford it.

Secondly, we know that, except for a very few wealthy people, the vast majority of Shanghai citizens are the actual supporters of Shanghai society—the salaried class, also known as the "hidden poor" class; and the majority are the "destitute poor" class. Therefore, we must not ignore the seriousness of Shanghai's food problem just because we see that many large restaurants and hotels are "always full of guests and never empty of wine," because the former is a superficial prosperity created by a very few wealthy people. This "prosperity" is built on the desert and is unproductive. The latter—the vast number of citizens—are struggling in "hidden poverty" and "destitution," suffering from the serious food problem.

Third, although the general salaried class has subsidies, it seems that they can supplement their income to some extent; however, it should be known that subsidies are increased or decreased according to the price index, and the so-called price index is calculated according to the official rice price of the Public Works Department. If we consider the ratio between the current price of household rice at 1.5 yuan per *sheng* and the price of rice purchased in small quantities ×××××××, then it is not difficult to imagine the actual significance of the subsidies.

Fourth, we cannot ignore the more important fact that the soaring black market rice prices also stimulate other prices in Shanghai. This not only increases the living burden of citizens, but also encounters obstacles in the implementation of price controls, and also stimulates rice prices and all prices in peaceful areas outside Shanghai. The impact of this is almost impossible to estimate.

Fifth, and most importantly, the rising prices centered on soaring rice prices will inevitably lead to an economic crisis, which will develop into a political crisis, so it should not be ignored!

Regarding countermeasures to the food problem, I believe the authorities are already planning wise and correct measures. Standing from the position of the Chinese people, we believe that the following points are very urgent, so we dare to offer humble suggestions to the authorities:

First, find ways to increase the rationed quantity: As mentioned above, the household rice that each person can receive now only meets half of the actual needs of each person, so that each person has to seek supplements other than household rice and has no choice but to make expenditures beyond their means, which increases the seriousness of rising food prices. Therefore, we hope to increase the rationed quantity of household rice, so that each person can receive at least half a *sheng* per day. The amount should also be specially increased for the working class. This will greatly reduce the severity of the food problem; at the same time, it can also curb the rise in other prices and facilitate the implementation of price control policies. The beneficial impact on society and politics should not be underestimated.

Second, we further hope to make "extra rations" universal, which can also significantly reduce the severity of the food problem.

Third, re-implement population dispersal in earnest, especially for those who are unemployed and have a hometown to return to. It should be actively promoted under more appropriate and convenient measures. As long as the measures are appropriate and provide more convenience to those being dispersed, especially in terms of not having too many restrictions and complications in the procedures, then the results will not be too low. In this way, on the one hand, the severity of Shanghai's food problem can be reduced; on the other hand, these unemployed people can be allowed to participate in production in their hometowns, participate in increasing food production, which has positive significance.

In addition, if it is temporarily impossible to increase the rationed quantity, small vendors can first be allowed to sell freely, and it can be stipulated that the price should not exceed twice the price of household rice. We remember that when the new legal tender was introduced in June, the black market price of rice in Shanghai was 500 yuan in old currency per *shi*, which should be 250 yuan in new currency ×××××××××××××××××. According to the current rice prices in cities along the Shanghai-Hangzhou and Shanghai-Nanjing lines, most are still only within 300 yuan, so allowing free sales at a price within twice the household rice price, or within 400 yuan, would still be profitable for the vendors and not too harsh.

We believe that the food problem is the most serious problem in Shanghai today, and it is closely related to the economy and politics of the entire peaceful area. We hope that all parties will quickly work together to find a thorough solution.

### Japan Determined to Fight to the End, Seeking to Achieve Common Goals: Prime Minister Tojo Speaks to German and Italian Reporters

Tokyo, 9th (Domei News Agency)—Prime Minister Tojo received reporters from Axis countries at his residence at 4:15 PM today. He stated that Japan has absolute determination and will work with its Axis allies to achieve common goals. Prime Minister Tojo met with nine German reporters and three Italian reporters as the first anniversary of the Axis military alliance signed on December 11th approaches.

General Abe Broadcasts: The Meaning of the Greater East Asia War

Tokyo, 9th (Domei News Agency)—General Abe, President of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, delivered a radio address to the nation tonight on the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, stating briefly: The United States and Britain should understand the basic fact that the reason why they have been repeatedly defeated by Japan is because their cause is unjust. Japan is fighting not only for self-defense but also for the liberation of East Asia, to prevent the high ideals of Anglo-American aggression. In this war, the enemy countries have no purpose worth fighting for and no moral justification. They are only fighting at the behest of their leaders who are promoting a policy of aggression and oppression in East Asia. The current war is not a war of self-defense for the United States and Britain, but a war for them to maintain their policy of aggression in East Asia. The history and destiny of East Asia are all acts of Anglo-American aggression. In particular, the United States has no reason to annex Hawaii and the Philippines. The world knows that American missionaries extracted wealth from China, and the United States, in concert with Britain, attempted to prevent Japan's legitimate activities in China and incited the Chinese people against Japan. Since Britain and the United States did not end this policy of aggression, the Greater East Asia War broke out. Therefore, this war is a war of self-defense on the part of Japan and a war for the enemy to expand its power unnecessarily. Japan is now determined to fight, not only to defend its own survival but also to eliminate the Anglo-American domination of East Asia.

### First Anniversary of the Greater East Asia War: Grand Celebrations in Various Places; Bose Appeals to the Indian People to Resist Britain and the United States in Added Efforts

Shonan City, 9th (Domei News Agency)—The citizens here celebrated the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia War yesterday with unprecedented grandeur. In the morning, the streets and public places were crowded with people, and Japanese flags fluttered everywhere. 1,200 people, including Japanese residents and representatives of various ethnic groups, participated in the commemorative meeting.

Rangoon, 9th (Domei News Agency)—More than 700 representatives from the Japanese dispatch army in Burma and the central administrative organs held a memorial service yesterday on the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia War to commemorate the Japanese soldiers and Burmese volunteers who died in the Burmese campaign. In the afternoon, Indian expatriates held a rally under the guidance of the Indian Independence League and passed a resolution thanking the Japanese army and vowing to resist Britain in pursuit of Indian freedom.

Bangkok, 8th (Central News Agency)—The Thai branch of the Indian Independence League held a rally at the National Theater here at 3:00 PM on the 8th to commemorate the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia War.

Jakarta (Batavia), 9th (Domei News Agency)—The Java branch of the Indian Independence League held a rally yesterday on the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia War. More than 1,500 Indians participated and passed resolutions thanking the Japanese army and protesting against British tyranny in India.

Berlin, 8th (Havas)—Bose, the leader of the pro-Axis Indian Nationalist Party, delivered a radio speech to the Indian people today, stating briefly: The war is trending toward a favorable opportunity for the Axis countries. This war is completely different from the First World War. In the First World War, Germany was blockaded. In this war, it is Britain that is being blockaded. The United States' post-war plan does not include an independent status for India. We have confidence in the future of the war. Therefore, every Indian national must redouble their efforts to resist Britain and the United States.

### Liu Jianxu Under Detention

Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency)—According to reliable sources, Liu Jianxu, Chairman of the Fujian Provincial Government and Deputy Commander of the Third War Zone, was detained by the Chongqing authorities on charges of violating military discipline after reporting on the local military and political situation at the Tenth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee. He is currently under strict interrogation. According to Liu Jianxu's reasons for arrest, there are two: (1) He often had disagreements with Chen Zhao, the Fujian Provincial Supervisor, leading to local administrative disputes. (2) The Fujian Three People's Principles Youth League and local tycoons accused Liu of protecting opium cultivation and other crimes. However, it is generally believed that the main reason for Liu's arrest is that the organizational structure of Fujian Province has always been extremely complex, and the local tycoons in the province most opposed Liu's policies. Therefore, the Supreme National Defense Council recently designated the province as a military strategic area and is carrying out large-scale military construction. In order to avoid obstacles to the advance of the Zhili faction into Fujian Province, the Chongqing authorities arrested Liu Jianxu. This is the fundamental motive.

### War Situation of Japanese Army in Hubei

Hankou, 9th (Domei News Agency)—According to war reports, the Japanese army in Hubei recently launched a large-scale attack on the Communist New Fourth Army and the 128th Division of the Chongqing army, inflicting heavy damage on them. The Japanese army set out from Tianerhe, west of Tianmen, and other places at dawn on Sunday, suddenly attacking 1,200 soldiers of the 128th Division of the Chongqing army and occupying Tianerhe in the morning. Since Sunday, the Japanese army has continued to carry out sweeping operations against the New Fourth Army operating around Zhujia Lake.

### Tank Battle Unfolds in Northern Tunisia: Situation Appears Favorable for the Axis; Only Skirmishes in the Libyan Region

Gil, 9th (Haitong News Agency)—Moroccan radio announced yesterday that a tank battle has been taking place near Tebourba for two days. The outcome is unclear.

Lisbon, 8th (Domei News Agency)—Since the Battle of Tebourba, the war situation in northern Tunisia has turned to the advantage of the Axis forces. An eight-day London broadcast also stated that if the Axis forces now secure their transport routes and are protected by strong air force, the Allied forces have no hope of counterattacking. The recent war situation is described as follows: (1) After the Allied forces abandoned Tebourba, the main forces immediately withdrew to the southwest and quickly mobilized reinforcements in an attempt to reverse the decline. The Axis forces launched a simultaneous air and land attack. Since the start of the tank battle on the 7th, the main forces of the two armies have entered a state of melee. According to reports from the United Nations side, the fiercest battle since the start of the war in Tunisia has now begun. (2) The Axis has completely secured the railway and coastline between Tunis and Bizerte. The air force is now using its full force to repeatedly bomb the Allied forces transported from the Algiers side to the front line. As a result, large fires have broken out everywhere on the narrow mountain roads leading to Taburba, hindering the advance of the British army.

Berlin, 8th (Havas News Agency)—German military sources recently stated that the Axis forces are continuing to advance near the city of Taburba in Tunisia. The British and American Allied forces are holding the mountainous area southwest of the city, but in order to implement an encirclement strategy against the German and Italian Allied forces, they have had to reduce their defense area. Although the British and American Allied forces have recently deployed a large number of tanks there for support, they will eventually have to retreat to avoid encirclement. Therefore, they have abandoned a large amount of land and lost a large number of military equipment and ammunition.

Lisbon, 8th (Havas News Agency)—According to an announcement released today by the British Middle East Command, the battle on the North African Libyan front is limited to skirmishes, and air battles are also more active than yesterday.

### German Troops Launch All-Out Counteroffensive in Eastern Front Despite Bitter Cold: Occupy Various Strategic Points Northwest of St. Petersburg; Particularly Fierce Fighting on the Central Front

Lisbon, 8th (Domei News Agency)—According to news received here, the German army has begun an all-out counteroffensive on the Eastern Front in the last two or three days. On the St. Petersburg front, the German army bravely attacked Soviet positions in the Don River plains despite the snow, and the Soviet army is currently busy defending. Various strategic points in the northwest and eastern parts of St. Petersburg have been completely occupied by the German army. In the northern factory area of ​​St. Petersburg, the German army breached several temporary Soviet positions and expanded the occupied area. According to Moscow news, it was admitted on the 8th that the Soviet army's operations were greatly hindered due to bad weather. As for the German troops in Yerzevo, Kalinin, and Wilkieel in the west of Moscow, the counteroffensive was very fierce. Especially in the area between Yerzevo and Vyazma, the two armies launched a tank battle throughout the 7th to seize Samz, a strategic railway point. The Soviet army suffered a concentrated bombing by German dive bomber squadrons, and most of its combat power was lost, so it had to retreat to the northeast.

Moscow, 8th (Havas)—The Information Bureau here issued a communiqué tonight stating that our forces in the Stalin City area and on the central front continued to attack in the original direction today.

### Turin, Italy Repeatedly Bombed

Rome, 9th (Havas News Agency)—The Italian Supreme Command announced this morning that Turin, Italy, was heavily bombed by enemy planes last night. The city center suffered heavy damage, and a hospital and a university were destroyed. Casualties are unknown. One enemy plane was shot down.

### Italian Industrial Personnel Fully Mobilized to Engage in the Production of War Materials

Rome, 8th (Haitong News Agency)—Today, the Italian government issued an order that all employees and workers of industrial institutions will be under the status of military personnel in the future and may not leave their posts without permission. Violators will be subject to military law. After Italy entered the war, it issued an order to mobilize employees and workers in military industries and public utilities, such as power plants and transportation service organizations. This time, the scope has been expanded again, and it is estimated that more than 4 million employees will be affected.

### Place Names in the South Seas Changed

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency)—The names of places in the Greater East Asia region, formerly ruled by the United States, Britain, the Netherlands, etc., which have lost their Asian characteristics, have been decided to be corrected by the Japanese government in order to adapt to the construction of Greater East Asia and restore the Asian characteristics of these place names. It was formally decided at the cabinet meeting on the 9th, and the Information Bureau also announced: (1) The former British Malaya will be renamed "Malaya". (2) The former British Borneo will be renamed "North Borneo". (3) The former Dutch Borneo will be renamed "South Borneo". (4) Batavia will be renamed "Jakarta."

### 51 Ships of the Toulon French Fleet Scuttled Themselves: Accounting for Three-Quarters of the Total; Four Submarines Escaped

Lisbon, 9th (Domei News Agency)—According to a Washington dispatch, US Secretary of the Navy Knox announced yesterday that, according to aerial reconnaissance and other reports, the French fleet in Toulon, the Mediterranean base, scuttled itself last month. However, a quarter of them are still in Toulon Harbor and have not been damaged. At that time, 50 warships and one cargo ship were damaged and sunk. In addition, four French submarines, in the hands of the Degoulle faction, escaped from Toulon and are still floating in the water and appear to be undamaged. Fifteen French warships are still floating in the water and appear undamaged, including two light cruisers. The French battleships "Strasbourg," "Dunkerque," and "Provence" have been injured and stranded, but can still be repaired.

Lisbon, 8th (Central News Agency)—According to a Washington dispatch, US Secretary of the Navy Knox met with a group of reporters on the 8th. Based on a public announcement from the US government, he stated that the damage to the French fleet in Toulon Harbor was less severe than initially reported. He said that one capital ship, one light cruiser, three large destroyers, three destroyers, two gunboats, four submarines, and five oil tankers of the French fleet were indeed seized by the German army. Knox also announced that the scuttled French fleet included one capital ship, five cruisers, fifteen large destroyers, eleven destroyers, one seaplane aircraft carrier, one submarine barrier laying ship, one transport ship, one old battleship, three submarines, and 51 ships in total. Two of the battleships may be salvaged and reused. Because when the above-mentioned 20-odd French fleet merged into the Axis fleet in the Mediterranean, the naval balance on both sides of the Mediterranean was lost, and the Allied rear communication lines had long become the target of the Axis air force and submarines.

### Franco's Speech States Spain's Position: Believes Liberalism Is on the Decline; Willing to Assist in Building a New European Order

Madrid, 9th (Haitong News Agency)—Spanish leader General Franco delivered a speech at the third conference of the Spanish Falange Party National Congress yesterday, strongly stating Spain's political ties with Fascist and National Socialist revolutions. He also said that if restoring the monarchy is beneficial to Spain, there is a possibility of taking this political step. His words briefly stated: Fascist National Socialism and the Spanish National Revolution are the same inseparable movement. These are all revolutionary movements of European culture and people. The domestic policies pursued by Spain are based on the principles of the Spanish National Revolution.

Berlin, 9th (Haitong News Agency)—Berlin sources believe that General Franco's speech to the Spanish National Congress is a declaration of spiritual war against liberalism, democracy, and Bolshevism. This speech expresses the unity of Europe. Franco recognizes the enemies of the new Europe and first fought against Bolshevism in 1936. Franco's warning to Spanish Communists shows his determination in domestic affairs as well.

### Diplomatic Activity High in Turkey for Britain and America

Zurich, 9th (Central News Agency)—According to a dispatch from Ankara, US Ambassador to Turkey Steinhardt, who returned to the United States to consult with his government on its policy toward Turkey and stayed in the United States for two months, returned to his post on the 7th and will hold talks with Turkish Foreign Minister Menemencioglu soon. In addition, Soviet Ambassador Vinogradov, who recently returned from Moscow, is currently very active. British Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen has also repeatedly mobilized since the Allied forces landed in French North Africa, attempting to draw Turkey into the Allied camp. According to sources in Ankara, the German government has called the Turkish government's serious attention to recent Turkish foreign policy. Well-informed local sources are paying close attention to this.

### Ambassador Shigemitsu Inspects Military Hospital

### The Inside Story of Mainland China Student Loans: Seemingly Doing Everything Possible to Protect Education, But in Reality, the Implementers' Measures Are Inappropriate

As early as February 5th of the 27th year [1938], the Ministry of Education of the Chongqing government promulgated the "Provisional Measures for Student Loans in Public Specialized Schools and Above in War Zones," stipulating that loans be divided into:

(A) Full amount: 8 or 10 yuan per month.

(B) Half amount: 4 or 5 yuan per month.

Subsequently, living expenses continued to rise, and revisions were made repeatedly. The current methods are:

(1) War zone student meal loans are divided into: Class A—granted to those whose original place of residence is occupied and whose economic resources are completely cut off, with a monthly loan based on 18 yuan, plus additional amounts.

(2) Self-funded student auxiliary loans are divided into:

Class A—granted to those from poor families whose original place of residence is not occupied, the loan amount is the same as Class B in item (1).

Class B—granted to those with more difficult economic circumstances, the loan amount is half of Class A.

The meal loan was initially a fixed amount. However, because rice prices rose at any time, the fixed amount was insufficient to maintain the students' nutrition. Therefore, it was changed to be calculated based on the local rice price, converting each person to two "shi dou" and one "shi sheng," plus oil, salt, vegetables, fuel, and kitchen worker expenses. Estimated based on Sichuan Province prices in July, the government's expense for a fully subsidized meal loan student is 90 to 100 yuan per month, about 1,300 yuan per year. Even if calculated based on war zone Class B or self-funded Class A, the government's burden is 70-80 yuan per person, 1,000 yuan per year. Considering only Class A and Class B loans, the annual cost is no less than 50 million yuan. In addition, there are special loans, spending money loans, uniform loans, etc., all established to help poor students in war zones.

The amount spent on student loans cannot be said to be small. On the surface, it seems to have done everything possible to protect education. However, this is not the case. Students in various universities are experiencing various dissatisfactions. Tracing the cause to its origin, it lies in the inappropriate measures of the implementers. Based on investigations, the general perception of inappropriateness can be summarized into seven points:

(1) After the war dragged on for a long time, students' economic abilities could not be simply divided by "occupied area" or "non-occupied area." There are often students whose families are in "non-occupied areas" but are economically very difficult, and there are also students whose families are in "occupied areas" but whose fathers and brothers already have another economic foundation in the mainland. If one cannot thoroughly understand the students' family backgrounds and insists on acting according to rigid regulations, unfairness is almost inevitable.

(2) Some schools stipulate that students who have remittances cannot receive loans. Although this is a kind of restriction method, it is prone to misunderstandings without detailed investigation. For example, if a student receives a remittance letter entrusted by a friend, the school authorities will cancel their loan qualification, which runs counter to the original intent of the legislation.

(3) There is also a regulation that those who have been disciplined will not receive loans. Although this contains the meaning of punishing evil and rewarding good, young people should be given an opportunity to rehabilitate themselves in educational principles.

(4) Students who apply for loans face numerous and overly cumbersome procedures. Official documents are repeatedly transferred, often taking several months, causing great distress to students who really need assistance.

(5) The loan management agency obstructs fairness in the review of students applying for loans, and there are inappropriate cases of selection, resulting in those who should receive it not receiving it, and those who should not receive it receiving it. There are also rumors that professors use loans to win over students, or that students use loans to take their lovers to the movies or eat in restaurants.

(6) The loan disbursement time is sometimes delayed for too long. There are even cases where loans for January and February are still being disbursed in April and May. If students rely entirely on loans for food, there is bound to be a risk of running out of food.

(7) In some places, the number of loan students is falsely reported to fraudulently obtain loans, or loans are deliberately suppressed and used for unethical acts such as investing in national bonds, which can be said to be a strange phenomenon in the pure and noble halls of learning.

There is originally no question about the loan system itself, but the implementation lacks the four key points of fairness, integrity, carefulness, and speed. Therefore, the malpractices are countless, and useful money is wasted in vain. If those who educate young people are like this, how can we blame the young people? Therefore, if university students cannot stabilize their lives, it will inevitably affect their studies. The decline in standards is also one of the factors.

Foreign Commentary

### East Asia Economic Conference Under the Great War - Tokyo Yomiuri Hochi, November 26th

The fourth East Asia Economic Conference, to be held from the 26th of this month, will carefully discuss and deliberate on various issues related to the East Asian economy. The East Asia Economic Conference has been held annually since December of the 14th year of Showa [1939], and two sessions have already been held. This year is the fourth session in total. Being the first meeting since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, it undoubtedly holds significant meaning. In past conferences, the Ministers of Finance and Foreign Affairs usually attended. This year, the Prime Minister, the Minister of Greater East Asia Affairs, and the heads of the Army and Navy information departments will also participate, which is particularly noteworthy in the current situation.

With the development of the Greater East Asia War, the East Asian Economic Sphere has greatly expanded, including Annam, Thailand, Burma, and various parts of the South Seas. In the East Asia Economic Conference, representatives from these regions will soon be seen attending. However, this time, representatives from Manchuria, Central China, North China, Mengjiang, and Japan will still hold discussions.

The "Essentials of Economic Construction for Japan, China, and Manchukuo" announced by the Cabinet Intelligence Department in November of the 15th year of Showa [1940], and the "Essentials for the Establishment of National Land Planning" decided by the Cabinet Council in September of the same year, both designated the three countries of Japan, China, and Manchukuo as the center of the East Asian Economic Sphere, with the Southern regions also included in the plan. Whether from the perspective of the history of construction or the perspective of the main supply of resources from the Southern regions, the three countries of Japan, China, and Manchukuo should be the center of East Asian economic construction, and this principle remains unchanged even today. The purpose of the East Asia Economic Conference is to promote economic integration between Japan, China, Manchukuo, and other East Asian regions, and to strive to strengthen their comprehensive economic power. Therefore, the construction of the already expanded East Asian Economic Sphere should also be an important topic for discussion among the representatives of the three countries.

Before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, countries around the world did not believe that Japan would submit to the demands of the United States in the negotiations, thinking that even if Japan rose up in resistance, it would inevitably be defeated by the powerful American military in an instant. However, Japan conquered the Southern regions in a short period and advanced from the Pacific to the Indian Ocean, creating an unshakable situation. However, they still refuse to give up the dream of the ultimate American victory and have begun to establish what they call a long-term strategy following this dream. The United States has now made a huge military buildup plan; Chongqing is still promulgating the National General Mobilization Law under the guise of independent resistance, and is starting to develop the Northwest, engaging in the construction of the Chongqing-India highway, in order to prolong its regime.

The Greater East Asia War is a long-term war, and the China Incident must also be resolved after the completion of the Greater East Asia War. Japan is currently advancing resolutely toward the completion of the war with such determination.

Therefore, in this situation, the responsibility borne by the East Asian Economic Sphere is very significant. It is no longer enough to simply talk about construction, etc. It must directly share the important responsibility of one wing and increase its war power to complete the Greater East Asia War. This is the first major significance and responsibility borne by the East Asia Economic Conference after the start of the Greater East Asia War.

Have the current situations in Central China, North China, Manchuria, and Mengjiang cultivated the strength to fulfill this major responsibility? The conference should not simply end with discussions or friendly talks, but should truly plan well according to the demands of the profound situation. (Translated by Ding)

### Hopes for the East Asia Economic Conference - Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, November 28th

The fourth East Asia Economic Conference will be held consecutively for three days from November 26th to 28th, with a large number of representatives from Japan, China, Manchukuo, and Mongolia attending. Its grand scale is not difficult to imagine.

The conference has contributed greatly to the economic construction of Japan, China, Manchukuo, and Mongolia. This is the first time it has been held since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, and its significance and responsibility feel even greater. Needless to say, the purpose of the conference is to promote economic cooperation; when the economic figures of the various regions gather together, they will sincerely discuss the best policies for the East Asian economy, clear up mutual opinions, and contribute to the construction of a new order in East Asia. However, at the same time, it is also an important goal to take this opportunity to give the economic figures from various regions a correct understanding of the actual situation of our country (Japan) in various aspects such as politics, economy, and culture.

Of course, these goals have not lost their importance at all today, when the China Incident has developed into the Greater East Asia War. Not only that, but under this Greater East Asia War, it is especially necessary to emphasize the understanding and economic cooperation of Japan, China, Manchukuo, and Mongolia, which have become the center of the new order in East Asia. Naturally, its content must be different from before. That is, since the start of the war with the United States and Britain, thanks to the magnificent achievements of the Imperial Army, the new order in East Asia has expanded to the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and its scope of coverage has become very wide, both regionally and racially. As a result, the important issues of production, allocation, consumption, transportation, finance, and prices that have always been discussed between Japan, China, Manchukuo, and Mongolia must also be re-examined from this perspective. Also, how to invite the various regions that have come to participate in the sacred task of building a new order in East Asia into this conference is something that must be considered.

It is hoped that those attending this year's Economic Conference, in view of the important mission undertaken by the conference, should concentrate their sincere intentions on defeating the United States and Britain, so that there will be no regrets in the cooperation of both material and spiritual forces for the completion of the Greater East Asia War, and take the opportunity to renew their determination to defeat England and America.

### Entering the Second Year of the Greater East Asia War: Strengthening Determination to Win Victory; Army and Navy Information Ministers Encourage Japanese Residents

Allied Press, local report: Shanghai's Japanese Navy Information Minister Colonel Kamata and Japanese Army Information Minister Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama stated at a gathering of Japanese residents last night that all Japanese people in Asia should strengthen their determination to win on the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia War and dedicate themselves to the war in order to achieve victory in this great struggle. Colonel Kamata addressed the general assembly of Japanese residents at the International Theater, stating that the Greater East Asia War is not a war against aggressor countries, but a war to help the weak and suppress the strong. The result is that it has destroyed the Anglo-American bases of aggression in East Asia, as evidenced by Willkie's statement after his world tour that the British Empire no longer exists. The victories Japan has achieved in the land, sea, and air during the past five years of the China Incident are due to the belief of Japanese soldiers that they will win every battle. However, this war will extend for many years, so the Japanese people should increase their determination to win, as strong as steel. The plan for one year lies in New Year's Day, and the plan for the Greater East Asia War lies in December 8th. We have entered the second year of the war, and we must boost our spirits and strengthen our courage. Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama addressed the general assembly of Japanese residents at the Donghe Theater, emphasizing that the Japanese people must first prepare to cope with all kinds of difficulties before they can achieve final victory. He also said that the Greater East Asia War is a war to establish a just and benevolent world and to build the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, so the Japanese people should spare no sacrifice to win victory.

In the textile industry, Wing On Textile fell below 1,900 yuan, down 45 yuan. Today's market price list is provided below.

### Gold Prices Stop Rising, Turn Flat

Call Loan Interest Rates and Military Scrip Unchanged

Yesterday, the listed price for new gold jewelry sold by the Dashin and other gold shops in the city did not change, remaining at 3,350 yuan per tael (purchase price reduced by about 200 yuan). The gold shops had no new price changes, and the price had stopped rising and turned flat and weak. The morning price was 3,350 yuan, down 30 yuan. It later rebounded slightly to 3,370 yuan. Some dealers stopped buying, and the momentum suddenly turned weak. In a situation of oversupply, the noon price was 3,310 yuan, with few buyers, down about 70 yuan from the previous day, a difference of 60 yuan. Trading was thin.

Ornamental silver was still listed at 16 yuan per tael, with inter-dealer trading at 17.5 yuan and 18 yuan for buying and selling prices.

Yesterday, the interest rate for call loans at the Money Trade Association remained unchanged at 1.4 jiao.

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw Japanese military scrip remain stable, with inter-dealer trading at 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 5 fen, and 2.4 li. Banks and small money shops sold at 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 6 fen, and bought at 4 fen and a half. United Reserve Notes fell to 4 yuan, 3 jiao, and a half and jiao for buying and selling prices, down 5 fen.

### In the Bitter Cold, Clothing is Hard to Find at a Reasonable Price

The market for factory-made cloth yesterday saw sellers dumping their stocks due to the upcoming registration of yarn with the Public Works Department, leading to a price decline. White cotton cloth fell by about 3 yuan per piece, with 12-pound Earth brand cotton cloth at 191 yuan, Dapeng at 190 yuan, and Fugui at 188 yuan to 189 yuan, all with transactions. However, coarse cloth remained stable, with little change. The most fluctuation was seen in Peach Blossom Lady Lin, falling from 321 yuan in the morning to 308 yuan. Later, due to traders actively seeking sales, the market sentiment rose again, rebounding to 315.5 yuan, with the final price at 313 yuan.

Eastern cloth rebounded yesterday, with serge seeing the steepest decline. It opened at 7 yuan and 9.5 jiao in the morning, plummeting to 7 yuan and 6.7 jiao.

Woolen fabrics have risen much more recently than before our newspaper was suspended. The market has been buoyed by rumors of favorable buying, and people's attitudes have changed. Financial institutions and wealthy dealers have been actively absorbing stocks, leading to extremely active wholesale trading in the market. However, because production at domestic factories has decreased rather than increased, and imported goods are increasingly sold out, there is a lack of circulating funds. Some are hoarding, while others are aggressively buying, causing prices to rise steadily. Yesterday, prices for riding breeches, paletot cloth, valencia cloth, Xuanwei cloth, white serge, ramie cloth, and other fabrics were even higher.

### High Pig Iron Prices, Scarce Sales

In recent days, various markets have been flourishing, and the hardware market has also gradually become bullish. However, sales of various products are actually sluggish, and much of the activity in the market is speculative, with actual sales being negligible. Pig iron is no exception. Although prices remain firm, sales are extremely scattered, and business is very quiet. Yesterday's market prices for pig iron were 5,000 yuan per ton for Indian Desert pig iron, 4,500 yuan per ton for steel mold pig iron, 3,200 yuan per ton for Shijinshan pig iron, and 2,700 yuan per ton for old pig iron.

### Sesame Nails Difficult to Sell

Trading in sesame nails ranging from 3 fen to 6 fen has been sluggish for a long time. Both wholesale and retail sales are slow. The main reason is that sales are difficult to achieve, so traders' morale is low. Although the stock of this product in Shanghai is not large, prices have remained weak. Yesterday's market prices were 1,400 yuan per case for 3 fen nails, 1,300 yuan per case for 4 fen nails, 1,200 yuan per case for 5 fen nails, and about 1,100 yuan per case for 6 fen nails. There is a shortage of 3 fen West nails, but sales are also lackluster, so prices are stagnant, at 1,500 yuan per case.

### Soaring Food Prices

Walnuts Tight and Strong - Walnuts are tight and strong because of active demand in the city. Top-grade Hebei walnuts are quoted at 480 yuan, ordinary southern walnuts at 450 yuan, and top-quality Dongchang walnuts are quoted at over 720 yuan but have not been sold. Market sentiment is therefore tight.

Black Dates Rise in Price - According to news from the production area, black dates have risen by 10 yuan due to the shrinking exchange rate, and prices in Nanjing have also risen by 30 yuan. Southern goods are priced as high as 530 yuan, and secondary goods are priced at 400 yuan. Northern goods are scarce.

Dried Scallops Firm - Dried scallops are in limited supply, and the market has recently firmed. Medium-sized dried scallops are priced at 5,000 yuan, and new small-sized Xingguang dried scallops are priced at 5,100 yuan. Suppliers are unwilling to lower prices, and further price increases are expected.

Sweet Potatoes Hoarded - Since rice prices have risen and supplies are scarce, sweet potatoes have become the first choice for most families to supplement their diets. They have risen daily from 35 yuan and 40 yuan. Yesterday morning they were still at 65 yuan, but by noon they had risen to 75 yuan. If measured by weight, the price may be even higher.

Cigarettes Remain Firm - Because gold thread has risen sharply, people are holding on tightly and unwilling to sell. British and American cigarettes continue to rise, while Japanese and domestic cigarettes are stabilizing. British American Tobacco's Big British brand is at 9,300 yuan, Old Knife brand at 8,400 yuan, Pinnacle at 8,000 yuan, Fairy at 6,600 yuan, and Five Flowers at 7,400 yuan. Japanese cigarettes such as Golden Gun are at 3,050 yuan, Golden Mansion at 3,500 yuan, Red Rose at 2,750 yuan, Quanlu at 3,150 yuan, Compass at 2,300 yuan, and Double Axe at 3,800 yuan. Domestic cigarettes such as Beautiful Spleen are at 6,100 yuan, Golden Mouse at 4,000 yuan, White Gold Dragon at 3,950 yuan, and Golden Dragon at 3,000 yuan.

Daily Necessities Expensive - The rising trend is alarming, and the selling prices of various goods have reached their highest levels. Due to the depletion of inventories, and stimulated by the recent rise in the prices of various goods, most merchants are becoming increasingly reluctant to sell and are only buying. For example, Guben soap has risen to 530 yuan per case, Scissors soap to 500 yuan, Huangxiangmao to 410 yuan, and Baixiangmao soap to 480 yuan, a significant increase of 30 to 40 yuan compared to the previous day. Phoenix brand matches are at 3,250 yuan, Beautiful brand at 3,400 yuan, Golden Tripod brand at 2,900 yuan, and miscellaneous brands at 2,500 yuan, also up 300 yuan. Price's candles are at 380 yuan, continuing to rise by 10 yuan.

Grains Rise Daily - Yesterday's grain market saw active trading, but because the supply was still limited, prices rose daily. Broad beans opened 30 yuan higher than before, and bean cakes also rose by 2 to 3 yuan. 60 bags of Chongming New Sand red beans were sold, with prices ranging from 310 yuan to 320 yuan. 60 bags of old red beans were priced at 225 yuan. 50 bags of Wujiang selected green beans were priced at 295 yuan. 140 bags of Minhang green broad beans were priced at 250 yuan. 20 bags of Tianjin red beans were priced at 280 yuan. Three trucks of Mingguang red sorghum were priced from 195 yuan to 200 yuan. Three trucks of Fat Brand cake were priced from 79.5 yuan to 78.5 yuan. Five trucks of Changji cake were priced at 77.5 yuan.

The稿費 for November has been calculated. Please collect it at the accounting office with your slip on the 11th, 12th, and 13th.

Sincerely,

### The Greater East Asia War Over the Past Year (3)

— Chen Binhe

(12) Battles in the South Pacific

Thus, the war progressed further, advancing towards securing Japanese-occupied territories and eliminating any possibility of Anglo-American counterattacks in the future.

First, in January, was the invasion of the Bismarck Archipelago. On January 23rd, landings were made on New Britain Island, and simultaneously on New Ireland Island. On the 26th, the general offensive on New Britain Island began, and soon after, the surrounding islands were completely occupied. In particular, the occupation of Rabaul and Kavieng, two important locations, made Japan's strategic position in the South Pacific even more advantageous, especially in successfully cutting off the connection between the United States and Australia to the greatest extent. On the one hand, the offensive against Timor Island west of New Guinea also progressed, increasing the effectiveness of the Japanese encirclement of New Guinea. On February 20th, the landing on Timor Island was completed. Transportation between the Dutch East Indies and Australia was now under Japanese control.

The Japanese army occupied the Bismarck Archipelago in the east and advanced into Timor Island in the west, forming a pincer attack on New Guinea. Subsequently, on March 8th, the Japanese army landed in New Guinea.

On March 31st, the Japanese army began the conquest of the Moluccas Islands and northwestern New Guinea. By April 19th, all key points in western New Guinea were completely occupied. After consolidating the west, they advanced from north to south, pressing towards eastern New Guinea.

When the Greater East Asia War developed to its fifth month, the area from the Solomon Islands in the east to New Britain in the west was occupied by the Japanese army. On April 19th, the pacification of western New Guinea was completed. As a result, Anglo-American forces in the southwestern Pacific were almost completely driven out, and Australia began to feel a significant threat. In particular, the Japanese occupation of Sumatra, Java, Timor, New Guinea, New Britain, and other islands, a continuous area of four thousand miles, formed an irresistible threat to Australia, and the American southward strategy in the Pacific was also destroyed.

(13) Control of the Indian Ocean

After Singapore and Sumatra were captured by the Japanese army, the Indian Ocean became the arena for the Japanese navy and air force.

First was the attack on Christmas Island, located two hundred and twenty miles south of the Sunda Strait. Since the Japanese army blocked the Strait of Malacca, the island had become the center of transportation between India and Australia. On March 1st, Japan began air raids, destroying Flying Fish Cove, the island's only harbor, and the facilities of the Anglo-American joint fleet. The Japanese navy began attacking the island on March 7th, and the Japanese army completely occupied it on the 31st, cutting off communications between India and Australia.

On the other hand, the Japanese army began attacking the Andaman Islands, a key area in the southwestern Pacific, on March 17th. This was a communication center between Singapore and India, equidistant from Madras, Calcutta, and Colombo, and could be said to be a shield for India's national defense. On the 24th, they attacked Port Blair and the Andaman Islands. As a result, the largest strategic point in the eastern Indian Ocean fell into the hands of the Japanese army, and the east coast of mainland India and Ceylon were exposed to the threat of Japanese artillery fire.

Finally, attacks on the Indian mainland also began. On April 5th, Japanese naval forces began attacking Colombo, the capital of Ceylon, the largest British military base in the Indian Ocean, destroying all British warships, ships, and air power. On the 6th, the Japanese vanguard approached the Indian mainland, carrying out air raids on Cocanada, a key location in northern Madras State, and Chicacole. From then on, air raids on India were almost continuous. Colombo and Trincomalee, two military ports, were the easternmost British military strongholds after the fall of Singapore, serving as the front line for defending their treasure trove, India. The vast waters of Bengal, from Burma through Calcutta to Ceylon, were all under their control. After these two locations were subjected to Japanese bombing, the Indo-British military authorities could not help but panic. Now, transportation between India and Australia was almost completely cut off, and communication between India and the United States was in a critical situation; the position of the Union of South Africa also began to attract attention. From then on, the Greater East Asia War entered a period of direct involvement with the wars in Europe and Africa.

(14) Attacks on the American Mainland

The Greater East Asia War contained the nature of a world war, and therefore, from the very beginning of the war, it was not limited to defense in the Pacific, but prepared for attacks on the American mainland. At 9:30 a.m. on December 8th, American radio reported that an American transport fleet sailing about 1,300 nautical miles west of San Francisco was attacked by submarines, and two of them sank. From this, it can be seen that maritime traffic along the American Pacific coast had long been threatened by Japanese submarines. On December 11th, the American naval authorities reported that Japanese submarines were operating on the American Pacific coast, and two American oil tankers were attacked. By December 30th, Japanese submarines were even appearing near the American coast, carrying out surprise attacks on Port Orford and Cove, shocking the American navy.

On February 25th, the Japanese headquarters announced that Japanese submarines had begun shelling American military facilities along the coast of California on the night of the 24th, achieving significant results. The American mainland began to suffer attacks, which was a historically significant event. Moreover, the political impact on the psychology of the American people was not to be ignored. President Roosevelt, in a conversation with reporters on the 25th, frankly admitted that the Japanese submarine shelling of the American mainland was "an example of excellent political strategy."

(15) The Miserable Defeat of Anglo-American Naval Counterattacks

When Anglo-Dutch-American forces suffered a disastrous collapse in the southwestern Pacific, it immediately aroused criticism from the people in Britain and America. To this end, the Anglo-American military authorities launched a "counterattack" against Japan.

For example, on May 6th, Japanese naval units operating in the New Guinea area discovered a powerful Anglo-American joint fleet in the Coral Sea southeast of the island and began counterattacking it on the 7th. According to the announcement of the Japanese headquarters, "Anglo-America attempted to stir up trouble in the South Pacific between Hawaii, Australia, and New Guinea, so it dispatched two of America's most elite aircraft carriers, along with many Anglo-American battleships and destroyers, establishing a powerful joint fleet to advance towards the Japanese line in the Coral Sea, but after a fierce Japanese counterattack, most of the enemy ships were destroyed."

However, Anglo-American propaganda about the counterattack continued. In order to completely eliminate any possibility of threatening the Japanese mainland, the Japanese side launched an offensive on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Line of the Third War Zone from March 19th, destroying the airfields and all facilities in Yushan, Lishui, and other places used by Anglo-America to threaten Japan, thoroughly eliminating the possibility of air raids on Japan.

(16) Operations in the Eastern Pacific

After all possibilities of threatening the Japanese mainland from the west and south were destroyed by the Japanese side, they began to eliminate possible threats from the northeast. Japanese naval air units began attacking the Aleutian Islands on June 4th. On the 7th, Japanese army units closely cooperated with the navy to attack Kiska Island, a military base in the Aleutian Islands.

After the American offensive routes in the central and southern Pacific were destroyed, they prepared to use Alaska and the Aleutian Islands as bases to attack the Japanese mainland, as a northern offensive route. However, military operations in that area could not be carried out in winter, and there was only the possibility of an offensive in summer, so Japan preempted the enemy by cooperating with the army to conquer Attu and Kiska Islands, instead creating a threat to the American mainland. On June 20th, Japanese submarines shelled Estevan Point near Canada, giving the Canadian people a great shock.

From then on, not only had the southwestern Pacific become a Japanese sea, but the eastern Pacific had also become the area of activity for the Japanese navy and air force.

(17) From the Solomon Sea Battle to the Advance into the Atlantic

On August 7th, Japanese naval air units discovered an Anglo-American joint fleet convoy in the Solomon Islands area. On the 8th, the Japanese navy dealt them a devastating blow. On August 14th, the Japanese headquarters announced that this battle had yielded unparalleled results in world history. The First Battle of the Solomon Sea thus ended in an absolute Japanese victory.

However, the Second Battle of the Solomon Sea followed. After the defeat in the first battle, the United States, in order to reverse the decline and boost morale, dispatched reinforcement fleets, advancing towards the waters east of the Solomon Islands on August 24th, but was immediately discovered by the Japanese side, which immediately launched air units to attack them urgently, inflicting heavy blows.

After the Second Battle of the Solomon Sea, Japan further seized the initiative and carried out the first air raid on the American mainland. On September 9th, Japanese seaplanes appeared off the southwestern coast of Oregon on the American Pacific coast, dropping incendiary bombs, causing a large fire, which shocked and disturbed the American people. Later, in late May, the Japanese navy even operated in the Atlantic Ocean, and thus the wars in Asia and Europe had already begun direct cooperation.

From the Solomon Sea Battle to the advance into the Atlantic, the historical development of the Greater East Asia War was demonstrated.

(18) The Third Battle of the Solomon Sea

Although the United States was repeatedly defeated, it did not completely abandon its ambition to counterattack. Especially the Solomon Islands – it was not only a shield for Australia but also an outpost for the United States; it was also the most important transportation center between Hawaii and Australia. As long as the United States could control the Solomon Islands, it could attempt to revive its forces in the southwestern Pacific. Conversely, if the Solomon Islands were completely controlled by the Japanese army, then not only would Australia be completely isolated, but Hawaii would also lose its value, and the direct threat to the United States itself would also greatly increase. It was precisely for this reason that the United States spared no effort, again and again, to collect its remaining forces in the southwestern Pacific, increase its new naval and air forces, and carry out a fierce counterattack in this area. From late October, especially in early November, it concentrated all its forces to pounce on the Japanese army, and fierce battles continued incessantly. In addition to constantly inflicting blows on the enemy, the Japanese army began active operations from the 13th, fiercely attacking Guadalcanal.

From the First Battle of the Solomon Sea on August 7th to November 14th, the results of the three Battles of the Solomon Sea show the ferocity of the three major battles in the South Pacific and how Japan maintained its dominant position in the Pacific with absolute superiority.

Enemy Losses:

Aircraft: 206 self-destroyed and missing, 31 severely damaged.

After the Third Battle of the Solomon Sea, the United States was clearly dealt a major blow, and doubts about its ability to counterattack had begun to arise among the Allied nations. At the same time, the result of this second front in the Pacific, proposed by the Chongqing regime and implemented by the United States, was such that political turmoil naturally occurred within the Chongqing regime.

The Prospects of the War

Now, as the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia War approaches and the situation in the Pacific has undergone fundamental changes compared to a year ago, it is very meaningful for us to observe the prospects of this war, and it can be said that it is necessary for the people of every Asian country to recognize it.

First of all, looking back at the war over the past year, where did the main reasons for victory or defeat lie? On the Japanese side, we can cite the following: First, political reform, mainly the realization of a unified national political system, so that all political forces in the country were directed towards a single goal—to win the Greater East Asia War. In particular, in terms of manpower, no Japanese person could be outside the war, no Japanese person could fail to share the responsibilities assigned by the war, and no Japanese person failed to provide their strength twofold under the government's command to serve the Greater East Asia War. Second, economic concentration, which was first reflected in the early completion of the national general mobilization plan, and in the fact that all national materials and financial resources were fully supplied to the government in accordance with the government's mobilization plan, so that the government could calmly control these national materials and financial resources in order to win the war. Everything was fully prepared, without empty words of propaganda.

Secondly, what about Britain, America, and their allies? From a political point of view, Britain and America themselves had irreconcilable contradictions. Britain's internal political contradictions, the struggle between the left and right wings, the anti-Churchill movement, and the activities of pro-Soviet factions, all revealed the ugly state of an aging empire in the process of decay, with "hundreds of holes." It was precisely because of this ugly state that national policies were chaotic, and national strength was dispersed. Not only did the people of the colonies begin to seek liberation, but also the people of the country could not help but be indignant at the incompetence of the government. The situation in the United States was not much better than that of Britain. At home, all anti-war factions were active, and there was even a faction that openly opposed Roosevelt's pro-Soviet war effort. Therefore, although the United States had the world's number one industrial production capacity, the actual amount that could be used to support this war could not but be greatly discounted. As for the impossibility of gathering the strength of the people, it goes without saying.

In terms of foreign policy and ethnic policy, Britain and America were even more trapped in unprecedented failure. For example, Britain and America did not have sincerity towards the Soviet Union. The "opening of a second front in Europe," which had been touted for more than a year, was never launched. And some people in Britain and America still believed that cooperating with the Soviet Union would only increase the burden on Britain and America and leave future troubles. As for ethnic policy, although Britain and America had drafted the so-called "Atlantic Charter" a year ago by Roosevelt and Churchill, in their actual measures in dealing with the Indian nationalist movement, they had already confessed that it was just a deceptive thing.

When we compare the situation of both sides in this Greater East Asia War, isn't the outcome of the war already very obvious? However, we cannot overestimate the enemy's strength too much. We should recognize that Britain has always avoided major battles in this war. It has retreated shamelessly all the way... Therefore, it has also preserved a part of its naval power. As for the United States, it is the largest industrial country in modern times. Although it also has hundreds of holes internally, it is also a fact that its country has not suffered fatal blows in the past few years. Therefore, the countries within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere should face these realities, face these realities squarely, correctly recognize their own position and mission, and redouble their efforts to welcome the arrival of the new era. Now is not the time to celebrate, now is the time for us to endure and welcome greater suffering! Everyone, get tense, everyone, unite! Strive and struggle! (The End)
