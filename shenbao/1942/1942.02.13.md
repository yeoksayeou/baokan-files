### Singapore City Area: Two Armies Engage in Fierce Hand-to-Hand Combat; British Forces Refuse to Surrender, Continuing Resistance; Fall of New Island Fortress Unconfirmed

Tokyo, 2nd (Domei News Agency) – Regarding the rumors of the fall of the Singapore fortress, the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters has received no report as of this morning. According to an announcement by the General Headquarters at 12:20 PM today, British forces are currently putting up stubborn resistance in the area of the central reservoir on Singapore Island. Japanese crack troops, under the cover of the air force, launched a fierce attack on them at dawn today, aiming to wipe them out in one fell swoop. It was also stated that after the Japanese forces attacked the British positions from the Bukit Timah area yesterday, the main defense line of Singapore Island has been completely controlled by the Japanese forces.

Somewhere in Singapore, 12th (Domei News Agency) – Lieutenant General Yamashita, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese forces, urged the British forces to surrender, but was refused. The Japanese forces then began a general offensive against the British forces in the Singapore city area this morning, and the two armies are engaged in fierce hand-to-hand combat.

Somewhere in Singapore, 12th (Domei News Agency) – Lieutenant General Yamashita, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Force in Malaya, after the Japanese forces entered Singapore City yesterday morning, had leaflets dropped by aircraft over the British lines, advising the Singapore British forces to surrender. The Japanese troops, who had been fighting for fifty hours since crossing the Johor Strait at midnight on the 8th of this month, are now lying on the ground at the racecourse in the northwest suburbs of Singapore City, taking their first rest.

Singapore, 12th (Havas) – The local radio station announced today that the British forces on the front lines were again forced to retreat. The Japanese offensive is using tanks as cover, and bomber and fighter groups are bombing the British lines. Furthermore, the Japanese Commander-in-Chief demanded an unconditional surrender of the city from the British Commander-in-Chief at 7:30 AM this morning, but the British side has not yet responded. There has been no major activity by Japanese aircraft on other fronts today.

Singapore, 12th (Reuters) – The British Far East Command announced yesterday that Japanese forces, covered by aircraft and tanks, have launched a fierce attack on Singapore City from the west, and have penetrated several locations today. Our troops in the western sector are unable to hold and have retreated. At 7:30 AM this morning, a Japanese plane dropped leaflets on our Commander-in-Chief, demanding the unconditional surrender of the entire army, which we ignored. Heavy fighting continues in the western and northwestern sectors, with no major battles in the eastern sector.

Canberra, 12th (Reuters) – Australian Federal Minister for the Army, Forde, declared yesterday that, according to a telegram from Major General Bennett, commander of the Australian forces in Singapore, the Australian forces are fighting strongly with other units of the British Empire. Casualties are unknown, with no official report yet.

London, 12th (Reuters) – According to reports from Batavia, no news has come from Singapore in the past twenty-four hours. The most recent news from Singapore was broadcast by the Malaya Broadcasting Station at 6:00 PM yesterday (Wednesday), stating, "There has been very little news from the front today."

Singapore, 11th (Reuters) – Military commentators analyzing the situation stated that it is understood here that women and children in Singapore have begun to evacuate, and supplies and equipment have also been destroyed. The end of Singapore is not far off. The Japanese forces clearly have the upper hand in the fighting due to their air superiority, and the small number of reinforcements that recently arrived on Singapore Island are insufficient to reverse the decline. The fall of Singapore will deal a serious blow to British prestige, which is undeniable. The fortifications of the Singapore fortress cost 60 million pounds and were considered the strategic hub of Britain in the Far East. The sinking of the Prince of Wales and Repulse initially endangered the British naval position, while the loss of Malaya placed the British naval dockyards within range of Japanese artillery fire, thus Singapore has lost its value as a naval base. But the loss of Singapore is an irreplaceable loss in the near future. If the Japanese forces use it as a base, the threat to the Dutch East Indies will become even more pronounced.

Tokyo, 12th (Haitong News Agency) – A telegram from Singapore just received states that the British forces on the island are only holding out in two locations. Japanese forces have broken into Singapore City from all directions, and a total of 40,000 British troops are trapped.

Dutch Main Forces Concentrated in Java

New York, 12th (Havas) – Dutch Foreign Minister Kleffens declared here today that if Singapore falls, Java will also be lost. The main force of the Dutch army is now concentrated in Java, actively deploying defenses.

Washington, 11th (Havas) – Military officials here recently commented on the imminent fall of Singapore, believing that, given the current situation, the final victory of Britain, the United States, and their allies will inevitably be delayed. Moreover, the loss of Singapore will make the defense of the Dutch East Indies extremely difficult. In the future, Australia will become the second fortress of the British and American defense line, and the troops of Britain and its allies will have to reorganize in Australia.

Stockholm, 12th (Haitong News Agency) – Military officials in Washington believe that the fall of Singapore will have terrible consequences for the Allies. The defense of the Dutch East Indies will become questionable. The Allies have no alternative but to withdraw to Australia as the main base between India and Hawaii.

American Journalists All Evacuated

Washington, 11th (Havas) – It has just been learned that American journalists here have all evacuated from Singapore Island at noon today (Singapore time).

New York, 11th (Havas) – An American news agency has just received a telegram from its Singapore correspondent at 10:30 PM today, stating, "I have received notice to pack up and leave within ten minutes. This is the last dispatch from this shattered fortress of the British Empire. Farewell, Singapore. I will try to leave safely. I know that war is approaching the city, even without reading official announcements. Planes soar overhead, and bombs explode constantly. From my office, it is clear where the war is taking place. Japanese aircraft strafe British troops with machine guns and bomb British vehicle positions with dive bombers, while the Singapore garrison has no fighter planes to protect them. However, the British army is fighting to the death. British biplanes are also bombing Japanese positions, but their speed is only 110 miles per hour at most. I do not know when I will be able to see Singapore again after this departure, which is heartbreaking."

Various Commentary on the New Island Battles

New York, 12th (Havas) – The New York Times commented on the critical situation in Singapore this morning, stating, "This is an extremely serious event in our nation's history. We must accelerate the production of military supplies to meet the needs of various war zones around the world. While it is not currently a question of launching an offensive in the Pacific, we must provide our soldiers on the front lines of all continents with weapons to maintain their positions, so that they can switch from defense to offense once the time is right. If Singapore falls at this time, the consequences will be unimaginable. Not only will the Japanese forces be able to reach the Indian Ocean directly, but in terms of politics and prestige, the foundation of the white race in the Far East will suffer a major blow."

Berlin, 11th (Havas) – Unofficial sources here recently issued a statement saying, "The victory of the Japanese forces in Singapore is the best gift that the Japanese forces can offer to the Emperor on the anniversary of the founding of the nation. This is a fatal blow to the British Empire."

Berlin, 12th (Havas) – The Berliner Börsen-Zeitung stated in an editorial this morning that the fall of Singapore will be a great disaster for the British Empire and a harbinger of major changes in the world situation, the result of which will be the destruction of world empires. The Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung stated that Britain's failure to send reinforcements to the Far East was due to the fact that Germany and Italy were fighting on three fronts in Europe, North Africa, and the Atlantic. The British Navy has suffered greatly from German and Italian attacks and has failed to protect its vast global territories.

Washington, 11th (Havas) – A White House spokesman recently declared that General Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission of China, met with General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces in the Southwest Pacific, in India, and exchanged views with British and Indian officials on the defense of India and China.

### British House of Commons Holds Secret Meeting to Discuss Shipping Issues; Churchill Reportedly Reinvited Cripps to Join Cabinet

Stockholm, 12th (Haitong News Agency) – London officials announced last night that the British House of Commons held a secret meeting yesterday to discuss shipping issues.

London, 11th (Havas) – The "Daily Picture" recently reported that Prime Minister Churchill has once again invited Sir Stafford Cripps, the former British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, to join the cabinet and share the burden.

Stockholm, 12th (Haitong News Agency) – The struggle between Churchill and Parliament has now developed into a matter of mutual prestige. The "Aftonbladet" correspondent in London calls it a struggle between stubborn men. The House of Commons also expressed dissatisfaction with the authority given to Production Minister Beaverbrook in Churchill's speech. Yesterday, the British press also largely supported Parliament against the government, saying that the current arms production is still the same as in the past and has not been fully reorganized. Churchill's establishment of a production department now is a reluctant move. Judging from Churchill's speech the day before yesterday, the appointment of a production minister was a temporary measure by Churchill to ease criticism.

Berlin, 11th (Havas) – The German News Agency recently issued a message stating that, in the view of German political figures, American newspapers' comments on the recent speech by Sir Stafford Cripps, the former British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, believe that the purpose of the Soviet Union is to control Europe, and German political circles are particularly concerned about the increasing approval of Cripps' views by the British press. The Foreign Affairs News reported that Cripps had said that the Soviet Union would become the most powerful country in Europe after the war, and it was a great shame that the leaders of Britain and the United States were using this to encourage the Soviet Union. This matter should enable the people of Europe to face reality. On the contrary, the German nation thanks the Führer for his instructions and has a clear understanding of this crisis. After the outbreak of the war, the European countries relied on the heroic sacrifices of the soldiers of Germany and its allies to avoid falling into the abyss of red terror.

### Plea on Behalf of a Mental Illness Patient

Dear Editor: I am a reader of your esteemed newspaper and have always been deeply impressed by your enthusiasm for social causes! I have a matter to humbly request your help with, within the realm of possibilities. If you grant my request, I will be forever grateful for your kindness and virtue!

I have a younger brother, who is fourteen years old. He suddenly suffered from mental illness at the age of four, becoming delirious and crying all day, unconscious and unaware. I have sought medical treatment and administered medicine, but to no avail. Now, his condition is even worse. When he is calm, there are no signs of illness, but he cannot speak (yet he is not mute, as he can sometimes utter one or two sounds). Once he becomes ill, he becomes maniacal, crying loudly or laughing strangely, running and jumping wildly, and destroying objects wantonly. This happens several times a day, and the whole family is extremely resentful. He is truly nothing more than a burden and a useless person. I am twenty-one years old, my father died early, and the whole family of five relies on me for support. We originally lived in Hongkou, but it was destroyed by artillery fire, and we have suffered greatly from displacement and hardship. The family is poor and struggling to make ends meet. Now, living expenses have become even higher. I am worried about the difficulty of maintaining food and clothing, and my brother's illness has only worsened, with constant crying all day long. In this situation, I cannot help but lose all joy in life! I have long heard of your benevolent heart and willingness to help those in need. Therefore, I take the liberty of asking you to introduce me to any charitable organizations or hospitals that can provide free medical treatment and hospitalization, or to provide any other assistance. I would be eternally grateful! Respectfully yours,

Ling Qi, February 10th. (Address: Rear厢房, Yuanhengli, New Tangjia Lane, Tianzheng Yitong Road, No. 79 upstairs)

### Charitable Organization News: Pude Society Advises Against Gambling During the New Year

Since the onset of winter, the Shanghai Pude Society has achieved remarkable results in various charitable activities such as distributing clothing, rice, and porridge tickets. Recently, with the soaring prices of goods, the suffering of the general poor has become even more severe. Therefore, the society has decided to distribute winter clothing and broken oatmeal all night long on Lunar New Year's Eve (i.e., the 14th) upon presentation of tickets, and to dispatch personnel to distribute porridge tickets to benefit the poor. The society, in view of the fact that many improper amusements (such as gambling with mahjong) are common during the Lunar New Year, consuming time and money beyond measure, believes that if the money spent on improper amusements is used to support charitable activities, the poor will benefit greatly. The society's address is No. 8, at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Wenzhou Road. Phone: 93671.

The Three Religions Charity Council Plans to Repatriate Hidden Poverty Sufferers to their Native Places

In addition to providing clothing and food to refugees on the streets, the Shanghai Three Religions Morality Charity Council has registered a total of 1,170 hidden poor and orphans who have undergone investigation procedures. The council regularly distributes food and financial assistance to them. Some are also sponsored by major benefactors. However, since problems have arisen with the source of rice and grain, the provision of supplies has become extremely difficult. In addition, with the cost of living rising continuously, the situation of the hidden poor and orphans has become increasingly dire. In order to enable them to return to their native places, the council is currently planning to provide funds for their repatriation, so as to prevent them from wandering around Shanghai. However, the total cost of repatriation is estimated to be more than 50,000 yuan. Therefore, it is hoped that benefactors from all walks of life will provide assistance, so that they can each return to their hometowns. The method of assistance is to go to the council's office at No. 10, Hongyun Villa, Lane 70, west of the New World on Jing'an Temple Road, to review the registered list of hidden poor and orphans, or to donate part of the funds, or to donate the repatriation expenses for several individuals or families, all of which would be a great act of kindness. The council's phone number is 91067.

The Cilian Relief Society Distributes Corn Flour Widely

Regardless of size, each person will receive sixteen city pounds of corn flour (a total of more than one hundred households, totaling about 700 people), requiring more than 11,000 pounds of corn flour.

### Main Culprit in the Chen Fusheng Kidnapping Case Two Years Ago Captured

In July of the year before last, Chen Fusheng, a wealthy businessman residing at No. 10 Xinpo Road, was broken into by multiple bandits, who kidnapped him and his wife into a pre-hired car and drove them quickly to a certain place in western Shanghai. They sent a letter demanding a huge ransom. After the case was discovered, the police rescued the two hostages and arrested two perpetrators, who were sent to court and sentenced to imprisonment. However, the leader of the case could not be arrested, and his accomplices fled and disappeared without a trace. Recently, Detective Wang Chenying and Chinese Detectives Xu Decheng from the Gordon Road Police Station received confidential information that accomplices, Jiangbei natives Rui Jinbiao, Sun Zhirong, Wang Chengyu, Zhou Guangsheng, and Huang Jinming, etc., were successively captured in the Jing'an Temple Road area. Yesterday, Wang Zhong, the leader of the case, was arrested in Nanshi. The police station dispatched detectives to transfer him. Upon investigation, these individuals have also committed multiple murders and thefts. The police station must investigate further and file public charges of kidnapping, murder, robbery, etc., in accordance with the criminal law and send them for trial together.

Spring and Autumn

### I am a "Temporarily Staying in Shanghai"

— Chongcao

My family of three, two-thirds of whom left Shanghai a few days ago so that they could return by sea to their hometown in eastern Zhejiang within a decent amount of time, in order to catch up with the old New Year rituals still preserved in the declining countryside. On the day of departure, I didn't have time to say goodbye at home, so I rushed to the port to see them off. I rarely run around the Bund area, and I was very rushed for time, and I was very unfamiliar with the place. As a result of running around, I couldn't find the ship I was looking for, and the people I was seeing off also disappeared. I heard the clock strike twice, which was past the agreed time, so I had to return disappointed. On the way back, my shoulders seemed a little lighter, but my heart suddenly felt empty. This is probably the common emotion of those left behind after a dispersal.

We don't have male or female servants, so we have to do everything ourselves, which is the consistent style in the countryside. We are used to living in large houses in the countryside, and once we are confined to a small room, it is very uncomfortable. Ever since I saw the lines of people buying rice, I often wondered what I would do if I were in that situation. My family asked each other: I didn't deign to do it, my old mother shook her head, and my weak wife was dejected. I wandered around the small room and checked the rice bucket and coal basket. As a result, I decided that it was "better to go back" and implemented a dispersal, while I stayed in Shanghai temporarily because I was lucky enough to have a job.

My friends joked that I was left alone, which is derived from "as long as the green hills remain, there will always be firewood to burn!" In this light, "temporarily staying in Shanghai" will not become a starving person. I have to thank my friends for their kind blessings.

### Mind Your Own Business

— Jia Xiang

One morning, in the drizzling rain, a father was walking with his son on the road when they saw a child by the roadside wearing only a thin shirt, shivering and wailing.

Son: "Dad, look how pitiful that child is!"

Father: "Silly child, beggars all pretend to be like that so they can get more money..."

That evening, the father was still walking with his son along the same road as in the morning when they saw the child who had been wailing in the morning lying stiff on the wet ground.

Son: "Dad, he's dead!"

Father: "Hmm!... Mind your own business!"

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

Seventeen: Homecoming

Mei Bao nodded and quickened her pace, squeezing past Xiang Qi's side, tiptoeing, step by step, closer to the small bed where Di Haitang was lying.

"Dad, Dad, Mom is here!" She didn't dare to shout loudly, but said in a very low voice.

But the person on the bed didn't move.

At that time, Xiang Qi had also stood in front of the bed, and with a heart beating abnormally, she leaned her head towards the pillow in the dim light.

To tell the truth, she really couldn't believe that this thin, dark, old, and ugly face was the incarnation of the graceful Begonia of seventeen years ago, unless she then discovered a small half-length photograph that she had taken at the beginning, which was placed on the corner of the quilt less than an inch away from Begonia's face, she really would have suspected that Mei Bao had mistaken another stranger for her father for the past ten years.

"Dad, Mom is here!" Mei Bao's voice was louder, she knew that Begonia had always been the easiest to wake up, why had she shouted so many times, plus so many people had come into the room, and he still didn't respond. "Dad!... Dad!"

When she bent down and took a closer look, she immediately burst into tears.

Xiang Qi stared straight ahead, and amid the alarmed cries of the Han family father and daughter and the Luo family mother and son, she barely stretched out her right hand and stroked Begonia's forehead, and before she could even cry, she lost consciousness like Mei Bao.

The person who needed a permanent home had found his home before they could get there. The only regret was that he didn't have time to see the person in the photograph that had been with him every day for more than ten years.

Celebrating the forty-sixth anniversary of the dream, Begonia! (332) (End of the book)

### Stage and Screen

Regarding the English V character at the entrance of the "Queen" theater, it has aroused a lot of discussion. Some simply pointed it out as an error. After inquiring with a university professor, the reply was that this is an ancient form, which can be used interchangeably, just like the Chinese character "糾" is interchangeable with "赳".

"Yang Guifei" is divided into six scenes: "Bestowed Title in Phoenix Garden", "Love Affair in Huaqing Palace", "Grievances in Shangyang Palace", "Begging for Skill in the Hall of Eternal Life", "Sudden Change at Mawei Slope", and "Divine Journey in the Palace of Supreme Void". There is only one intermission in the middle. The remaining scene changes will all use lighting, scenery, and other techniques to make sudden changes. Mr. Fei Mu's special strength is to create a special style of directing.

Drama troupes are rehearsing new plays, and Peking opera troupes are inviting new actors to compete for the New Year's audience, and the competition is quite fierce. This is already well known. However, there are also "unpopular" storytelling venues that are also competing. Old-fashioned venues such as Huiquanlou and Nanyuan are not worth mentioning. New-style storytelling venues such as Dongfang, Zhangyuan, and Cangzhou are all competing to hire "Xiangdang" (lead storyteller), because the 爱文 Hotel and the 滃州 Hotel have also newly opened storytelling venues.

Yuan Shaomei, Zhou Qi, Lü Yukun, and Xu Xinyuan have joined the cast of "The Inspector General" at "Longmen," directed by Fang Xin.
— Taixu

Yu Sulian, who became famous for collaborating with Zhou Sengfang in "Wen Ruyu," will follow in the footsteps of Wang Xichun and star in "Turbulent Times Scenery" at Jin Xing. The character in the play is a wise and virtuous wife and mother in her thirties, and the second half will be performed as a socialite.

### Maoer Opera

— Zefu

In Shanghai, women's opera was formerly called Maoer Opera. Some say that this Mao is the Shanghai colloquialism for fashionable. Maoer Opera, that is to say, is an opera performed by fashionable girls. Jin Qizhong believed that the meaning of Mao is hair to the eyebrows, and that it is also a term for talented and handsome people; to call it Maoer Opera means that the ages of the actors are all young, their skills are all skilled, and they are all obtained through selection, and there is not a single incompetent person (see Qing Dynasty Miscellany). Wang 　believed that it should be written as 猫儿 Opera. It is said that a certain woman in Yangzhou was good at this art, and taught her female disciples to perform on stage at a young age. This woman's nickname was 猫儿, so she named the opera after her name (see Ying Ruan Miscellaneous Records). Ge Yuanxu also believed that it should be called 帽儿 Opera, because there are gauze hats and square scarves of various colors in the opera characters, and women dress up as men, so it is named (see Shanghai Tour Miscellaneous Records). There are many opinions, and it is not known who is right and who is wrong. This opera was most popular in the late Qing Dynasty and early Republic of China. At that time, it was considered confusing and hard to distinguish between male and female, which had never been heard before, and was admired. In fact, women's opera has existed since ancient times. The Book of Music says "disturbing mixed children," disturbing means 　monkey, meaning that during the dance opera, it is like 　monkeys, where there is no distinction between men and women. During the Tang Dynasty, male musicians lived in the Pear Garden, and female musicians lived in the Yichun Courtyard, and they were on par with each other. During the Yuan Dynasty, such as the female courtesan Zhulianxiu, etc., were all able to excel in both male and female roles. However, in ancient times, there was no mention of the name Maoer, and it is not known what its meaning is.
