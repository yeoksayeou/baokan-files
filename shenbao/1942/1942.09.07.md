German Headquarters, 6th (Havas News Agency) - The German High Command announced this afternoon that the entire Taman Peninsula is now under German control, with many prisoners of war captured, along with thirty-seven light and heavy artillery pieces and a large quantity of military supplies. German and Romanian forces in the Novorossiysk area have further approached the city while penetrating enemy positions. German speedboats in the Black Sea sank four enemy ships and four barges, totaling 9,500 tons. After several days of fierce fighting in the Caucasus Mountains, German forces continued to occupy a mountain pass. The fighting in Stalingrad is extremely intense. With the assistance of the air force, Soviet forces launched a counter-offensive to the north, losing eighty-four tanks. The city, its airfield, and supply lines are being bombed day and night. Two tugboats on the Volga River were damaged by artillery fire. Soviet aircraft attacked the German airfield in the Voronezh area, and twenty-seven were shot down with no German losses. Counter-offensives by enemy forces southeast of Kaluga and Rzhev, south of Lake Ladoga, and near Leningrad have all failed. German forces attacked several enemy airfields, destroying twenty Soviet aircraft. Near Kronstadt, German artillery sank one Soviet minesweeper and one barge. In the Arctic Ocean, German aircraft bombed the Murmansk shipyard and railway infrastructure. From August 25th to September 4th, the Soviet Air Force lost a total of 1,062 aircraft, while German aircraft lost forty-nine on the Eastern Front.

Berlin, 6th (Allied News Agency) - Military sources stated today that the entire Taman Peninsula east of the Kerch Strait is now under German control, as German forces continue to advance southward, breaking the last Soviet resistance on the peninsula.

Ankara, 6th (Allied News Agency) - The Soviet High Command's supplementary communique last night stated that Soviet forces northwest of Novorossiysk, under attack by powerful German forces with tanks and heavy artillery, were forced to retreat to new positions.

Soviet forces are continuing to fight German forces crossing the river in the Mostok area.

### The Battle Line at Stalingrad: 25 Days of Fierce Fighting, Most Advanced Fortifications in the Defense Zone Captured by German Forces

Soviet Border City, 5th (Havas News Agency) - Today is the 440th day of the German-Soviet War. The German High Command launched a decisive battle for Stalingrad, which has lasted for twenty-five days. The strength of the German and Allied forces totals no less than 200,000 men, with 2,000 tanks and at least 1,000 aircraft. The Red Army, facing such a formidable enemy, is currently engaged in a desperate battle to defend this "Steel City," but its situation is becoming increasingly critical. Its defense line is semi-circular, blocked on one side by the Volga River and on the other by German positions. Since German forces entered the suburbs, fierce fighting has occurred in the outskirts, and the battle has even approached the city. Although the Red Army quickly established new positions, attempting to continue the fight, the most important problem is now the issue of withdrawal, because German aircraft continuously bomb both banks of the Volga River, making it difficult for the Red Army to retreat. Northwest of Stalingrad, the Red Army is still continuing its offensive, attempting to break through German positions and to establish contact with General Timoshenko's forces advancing from the north, but without success. This Red Army force has at least 150 tanks, but few aircraft. German aircraft are continuously bombing Stalingrad day and night, causing large fires in the city. The reason for the German success in this attack on the city is due to the German use of "Ironclad Hand Grenade Teams." These units are composed of specially modified armored vehicles, with reinforced bodies and equipped with mine-laying and flamethrowing equipment, used as vanguards for mechanized units, advancing under smoke screens and proving invincible. In addition, the Germans are using a new type of weapon, a light tank equipped with mortars and machine guns, to attack Red Army fortifications along the Volga River.

Berlin, 6th (Havas News Agency) - A late-night supplementary report states that a large number of the most advanced fortifications in the Stalingrad defense zone have been captured by German forces. In addition to occupying several important villages, German forces also captured a Soviet base on the outskirts of Stalingrad. Twenty-nine Soviet fortresses built of steel plates and reinforced concrete were destroyed by German forces. Enemy forces launched a counter-offensive, attempting to fill the gaps in their defense line, but suffered heavy losses and were repulsed. Soviet infantry, covered by 100 tanks, repeatedly attacked in the southern part of the Stalingrad defense zone but were also repulsed by German forces.

Germany Intensifies Encirclement of the "Red Verdun"

Stockholm, 6th (Allied News Agency) - General Paulus, commanding a million troops and three thousand aircraft and artillery pieces, is preparing to launch a final attack on the center of Stalingrad. Reports that the German vanguard has entered the Stalingrad city area have not been confirmed, but it is known that German forces have advanced to the southwest and northern suburbs of the city, intensifying the encirclement of this "Red Verdun." Fierce Soviet counter-offensives have failed to break the German encirclement. The German pressure on the southwest of the city is particularly strong, with reports of a concentration of 500,000 German troops in that area. Moscow sources acknowledge that the Soviet forces in the city are in a very critical situation, and important industries have been evacuated from the city. Meanwhile, hundreds of German aircraft are attacking Soviet forces. The German forces northwest and northeast of the city, with the assistance of the air force, are expected to link up within days. In aerial combat yesterday, the German Air Force shot down more than thirty Soviet aircraft.

Somewhere on the Ukrainian Border, 6th (Havas News Agency) - It has been learned that German assault troops stormed into the central area of Stalingrad last night. The Soviet side began evacuating civilians on the 3rd of this month, but because the two major railway bridges over the Volga River have been destroyed by German dive bombers, the evacuation of people has been very slow. Currently, fierce street fighting is taking place. All roads have been mined, making German advancement difficult. German troops are engaging in hand-to-hand combat with Red Army soldiers hiding in houses, armed with hand grenades and bayonets, prepared to fight to the death. However, German mechanized units have arrived on the outskirts of Stalingrad from the west, followed by infantry. In addition, German forces reoccupied the city of Krasnoarmeysk this morning (on the Volga River, southeast of Stalingrad).

### German Forces on the Southern Front in Egypt Withdraw Slightly Westward: Reorganizing Into More Defensible Positions, Burned-Out Vehicles Litter the Battlefield

Bern, 6th (Allied News Agency) - According to news from Cairo, the fighting in Egypt has calmed down due to General Wimmer's cessation of the offensive. German forces have also moved slightly westward, perhaps in search of a more easily defended sector. The area previously contested by both sides is now littered with burned-out vehicles. However, both sides are extremely active in the air, bombing positions and artillery emplacements.

Cairo, 5th (Havas News Agency) - The British Middle East Command recently issued a communique stating that there has been fighting on the central and southern sectors of the Alamein front. Allied forces have withdrawn slightly westward and are reorganizing their positions.

London, 5th (Havas News Agency) - The London Times recently carried a dispatch from its correspondent at the Egyptian front, stating: "Near Alamein, many German tanks were seen abandoned on the battlefield. At the same time, many British tanks and trucks were abandoned in 'no man's land'. This provides clear evidence of the heavy sacrifices made by our Eighth Army. German General Rommel has withdrawn his troops to new positions, seven or eight miles behind the original positions, and has concentrated the 19th German Light Division and the 15th and 21st Italian Tank Divisions there. As a result, his forces now have thousands of tanks, trucks, and other motorized vehicles, preparing to launch a major offensive under artillery cover."

Istanbul, 6th (Havas News Agency) - Cairo dispatch last night, strong winds and sandstorms occurred in Egypt, affecting military activities on both sides.

Fierce Air Combat Between German and British Air Forces

Berlin, 6th (Havas News Agency) - The German High Command issued a report on the Egyptian battle situation yesterday, stating that from August 31st to September 2nd, Axis aircraft shot down seventy-six British aircraft on the Egyptian front. During the same period, a total of fifty-one British tanks were destroyed.

German Air Force Captain Marseille shot down sixteen British fighters in one day. He has established an outstanding record of personally shooting down one hundred and twenty-five enemy aircraft.

Berlin, 6th (Havas News Agency) - According to responsible sources here, German aircraft heavily damaged British motorized units on the Alamein front.

### Vichy's Attention: Northwest Africa and National Defense Matters All Discussed by Cabinet

Vichy, 5th (Havas News Agency) - The cabinet held a meeting here a few days ago. The official communique released afterwards only stated, "Government leader Laval reported on the political situation, especially informing colleagues of the results of his recent trip to Paris for talks with the occupying authorities." The matters discussed at the cabinet meeting were not elaborated upon. However, judging from what has been published in newspapers in the occupied territories in recent days, it is not difficult to get a glimpse. For example, the "Journal" reported that, according to reliable sources, various issues related to the defense of the French Empire, especially French West Africa and North Africa, were discussed. Although officials have not confirmed this, given that the Governor-General of French West Africa, Boisson, and the Resident-General of Tunisia, Admiral Estéva, have both returned to Vichy to report on their duties and have held very important talks with key government figures, it can be seen that there is indeed a reason for this. Changes in government administration and diplomatic personnel were also discussed. The Governor of the Seine Department, Magny, has resigned and has been succeeded by Bouffet, who is likely to serve in the diplomatic service. Another issue that has also caught the attention of the French cabinet is the recruitment of French workers to work in Germany. The cabinet has already taken measures in this regard to step up the recruitment of workers. For example, some factories have been merged and the working hours of some industries have been extended in order to free up more workers to be sent to Germany. The leader of the mass rally movement, and also a pro-German figure, Déat, published an article in his "Work Report" yesterday, discussing this issue. His article stated, "The number of our country's workers who have gone to work in Germany is vastly different from what we originally expected, which is deeply regrettable. If this situation cannot be improved, it will be necessary to take other measures, such as conscripting workers, which would be the best solution." He called on the youth of our country to register enthusiastically to work in Germany, so as to contribute to the release of our country's prisoners of war. In addition, the Jewish question was also likely discussed at the cabinet meeting. The measures recently taken in the free zone do not seem sufficient to curb the arrogance of the Jews, and the Jews are still secretly engaging in activities that endanger the country. Therefore, the government must take strict measures against the Jews in the free zone.

### Argentine President's Speech: Maintain Neutrality

Buenos Aires, Argentina, 6th (Havas News Agency) - President Castillo today received representatives of the people and received a petition signed by thousands of celebrities from all walks of life, advocating that the government maintain its neutral policy in the current war. Therefore, the President took the opportunity to deliver a speech, saying, "Some people say that the policy of neutrality has isolated our country. This statement is not true. Maintaining a neutral position is the only easy path to avoid the ravages of war and to be close to the people of all countries. However, it is reasonable to say that neutrality has deprived our country of essential resources, because although our country has achieved political independence, it is still not economically independent. In short, our country is not afraid of war, but everyone must work hard to avoid the ravages of war. However, when it comes to defending our national dignity, we will never shrink back."

Buenos Aires, Argentina, 6th (Haitong News Agency) - News came from the capital of Brazil last night that the Chilean Embassy in Brazil yesterday specifically denied the rumors that Chile would sever diplomatic relations with the Axis powers after the President returned from Washington. It was vaguely stated that the President of Chile should still maintain his freedom of action after visiting Washington.

### Cotton Cloth Merchants Arrested; Speculation in Black Market Disappears; Cotton Cloth Market Ceases Activity; Speculators Disappear Without a Trace

The Shanghai Times reported that the arrest of 452 brokers and speculators at the cloth market at 115 Hankou Road on the 3rd of this month has caused panic among other brokers who assist speculators in trading. Black market activities have been suspended, and brokers have disappeared without a trace, not daring to act rashly. Observers, recalling the prosperity of the brokerage and speculative trading on Sichuan Road in the past month, believe that the current silence seems to foreshadow an imminent upheaval. The meeting place of brokers has now moved from Sichuan Road to Avenue Foch, but the French Municipal Health Department has been monitoring all activities of these people, so brokers gather every day, no longer discussing speculative trading, but speculating on what measures the police plan to take against them. It was rumored a few months ago that the police would arrest all the brokers on Sichuan Road. Last Wednesday, there was indeed a large-scale arrest. Spot prices continue to trend downward, and speculators are eager to dispose of their goods, but there are no buyers in the market, and there are very few brokers who are still selling goods. Regarding the arrest of 452 people in the cloth market, the police are continuing to investigate and there have been no further developments.

The prices of all goods are below the general market price, so customers were thronging the store yesterday, almost to the point of breaking down the door.

### Five Ships Now Operate on the Shanghai-Ningbo Route; Passengers Limited to Carrying 500 Yuan in Cash

Since the addition of Xinning Shao, there are now five ships operating on the Shanghai-Ningbo route, including the original four ships: Mingmen, Haitong, Wanji, and Wansheng. The traffic between Shanghai and Ningbo is very smooth. The Datong News Agency reporter has explored the situation as follows:

Five Ships Now Operate on the Shanghai-Ningbo Route

It is reported that the latest sailing schedule for the Shanghai-Ningbo route includes the Haitong, Mingmen, and Wanji ships, which are scheduled to sail to Ningbo together yesterday. In addition to the Mingmen, which docks directly at the Taikoo Wharf on the Bund, the Haitong and Wanji ships must transfer to the Yangzi Wharf in Yangshupu to board. The Xinning Shao and Wansheng ships are scheduled to sail to Ningbo on the 8th. In addition to the Xinning Shao, which docks directly at the Taikoo Wharf, the Wansheng ship must also transfer to the Yangzi Wharf to board.

All Must Have Five Certificates

Passengers traveling between Shanghai and Ningbo must have four types of certificates: stool certificate, epidemic prevention certificate, dysentery certificate, and smallpox certificate, before they are allowed to purchase tickets and board the ship. The local inspection of these certificates is extremely strict, and those without certificates are not allowed to land. At the same time, they must also obtain a return home certificate from the Municipal Council or the hometown association. The procedures must be complete, so that the journey will be unimpeded. Do not be careless, lest you suffer losses.

Strictly Limited Amount of Cash Carried

Recently, Ningbo has also stipulated that the maximum amount of cash that passengers can carry in and out is limited to 500 yuan in reserve certificates. If this amount is exceeded, the excess amount will be confiscated. This point is extremely important and should be fully understood. The exchange limit between Shanghai and Ningbo can be relaxed to 100,000 yuan in reserve certificates. If this amount is exceeded, the purpose must be explained to the bank for verification. The above regulations concern every passenger to and from Shanghai and Ningbo, so please pay attention.

### The Baojia System and Concession Security: Municipal Council Police Supervisor's Broadcast

Municipal Council Police Supervisor Watanabe broadcasted on Dadao Broadcasting Station at 6:30 PM yesterday, with the Baojia system and Concession security as the topic. He gave a detailed explanation of the state of security in the concession under the Baojia system. In brief, the current security in the concession is greatly improved compared to before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. This can also be clearly seen from the daily crime statistics. This is truly the most gratifying thing for those of us who are responsible for maintaining security. Naturally, this is due to the cooperation of the Japanese authorities and the Chinese and Japanese residents. Before explaining the current state of security in the concession, let us review the situation before December 8 last year, that is, during the era of British rule. At that time, due to the chaotic political situation, the maintenance of security was truly disheartening. For example, political acts of terror, anti-Japanese remarks, and anti-Japanese education formed obstacles to the work of the Japanese side in the concession. In addition, the unrest in the political situation led to the continuous occurrence of heinous crimes such as armed robbery, kidnapping, and abduction. Shanghai was no less than a city of crime, "the Chicago of East Asia." However, on December 8 last year, the Japanese army entered the concession, and the Anglo-American institutions with a century of history were overthrown overnight. The anti-Japanese elements lurking in the concession suffered a severe blow and disappeared. At that time, their remnants, on February 15 of this year, that is, on the Lunar New Year's Eve, attempted to disrupt security in the Public Concession, and more than 20 innocent Chinese people were sacrificed. At that time, the Baojia system was implemented under the guidance of the Japanese Navy in Hongkou and Yangshupu, and the results were quite good. The municipal government also implemented it in Nanshi and Huxi. In order to sort out household registration and curb terrorist incidents, the Public Concession conducted various studies and also planned to implement the Baojia system. The Japanese military authorities then took countermeasures. According to the Japanese military's announcement, they cooperated with the preparatory authorities to block off the area near the scene of the incident. Because the people had long been deeply disgusted with terrorist acts, they gradually voluntarily cooperated with the Japanese military authorities and the police. On February 20, 500 influential Chinese people were convened, and for the purpose of preventing terrorist incidents, they unanimously resolved to form a self-defense organization or a complete Baojia organization. The self-defense corps was established the next day. By March 1, the establishment of the Baojia preparatory committees in various police districts was completed, and the first congress was convened on that day, declaring the implementation of the Baojia system and electing Yuan Lvdeng as the chairman. By the beginning of May, the selection and appointment of general Lianbao chiefs, Bao chiefs, and Jiachiefs, as well as the allocation of the reduced posts of the self-defense corps, were all completed. On May 18, the Baojia Preparatory Committee was renamed the Baojia Guidance Committee, and the first meeting of Lianbao chiefs and above was convened, and the author issued letters of appointment. As for the household registration survey, it was completed in June, and citizen certificates were issued at the same time, and everything is now ready. Recently, the Baojia health class has been organized to awaken the people's hygiene awareness and eliminate epidemics, and active activities have begun. In addition, the Japanese military authorities previously issued an announcement on civil air defense in Shanghai, which was first used by the Baojia organization under the guidance of the police authorities. At the beginning of the implementation of the Baojia system, there were some concerns that the residents of the concession, who had long been influenced by European and American liberalism and confused by Japanese propaganda, would be able to cooperate with the Japanese side to develop a spirit of self-government. Later, with the rapid changes in the Greater East Asia situation, it promoted the awakening of the citizens. Now the Baojia Guidance Committee has become an autonomous organization, an auxiliary organ of the concession police, and has taken on heavy responsibilities. Next, let's explain the Baojia organization. Under the chairman of the board of directors, the Baojia higher organ has the Baojia Guidance Committee, which is under the guidance and supervision of the police supervisor for the purpose of strengthening its operation. Under the Guidance Committee, the police chiefs and deputy police chiefs are set up in each police station, and below it is the detailed organization of the Lianbao chiefs, Bao chiefs, and Jiachiefs, which is no different from the neighborhood security organization in Japan. The Baojia district is divided into seven general Lianbao, with 12 Lianbao, 397 Bao, and 477 Jia according to the police station's jurisdiction. According to the household registration survey, the total number of households in the Baojia district is 61,705, and the population is 883,089. The characteristic of the Baojia system is that it has a self-defense organization attached to it. The purpose of the Baojia system is self-defense, and the self-defense corps in the Public Concession bears considerable responsibility for maintaining security. The active activities and merits of the self-defense corps are recognized by everyone. Each person grasps the spirit of self-government and develops the spirit of sacrifice and public service. To date, many criminals have been arrested by the police corps members. Now, let's explain the relationship between the implementation of the Baojia system in the Public Concession and crime. Last year, the total number of crimes averaged 2,230 per month. In July of this year, it decreased to 1,770. Terrorist activities averaged slightly less than 10 per month last year. After entering this year, there has been a significant decrease. Since May, there has not been a single terrorist case each month. The "evil city" of the past has become a paradise. When the author took office here at the end of last year, he pointed out how many shortcomings Shanghai had. Now, with the guidance of the various authorities and the assistance of the Chinese and Japanese residents, the goal has been achieved. In the future, the Baojia's mission in maintaining security and controlling the economy, as well as other cultural movements and ideological issues, will become increasingly important. It is hoped that all parties will give full assistance to the police and the Baojia organization in the future.

### Easing the Source of Goods is of Utmost Importance: Strange Phenomenon Amidst Price Controls

The Lian government's price controls have been quite effective. Starting September 1st, they forced the prices of general daily necessities to be reduced to half of the average price from May 26th to 28th. All stores in the city complied, which is commendable.

In the past, the faster prices rose, the more eager people were to buy goods, which in turn made prices even higher. If prices were to fall instead of rise, stores would be deserted. Therefore, general merchants often used price increases as a rallying cry to fuel inflation. This publication once called it "a new philosophy for maintaining market prosperity."

Now that prices have been falling for several weeks, business in various stores has indeed been quite slow. This time, stores have been ordered to reduce prices across the board, so business should be even slower. However, the situation is quite the opposite. The more diligently a store reduces prices, the more crowded it becomes with eager customers. Even the city's five major department stores have had to close their iron gates and hang up "full" signs, similar to the scene outside a popular movie theater when a famous play is being shown. This is unprecedented in history, both in China and abroad.

Why is the landscape of rising and falling prices so different now compared to the past? This is because there have been significant changes in the supply and demand environment for goods. In the past, although the supply of goods was decreasing daily, there was still a steady stream of imports. The problem was only hoarding and speculation. Hoarding was done to prevent price increases and because of optimistic expectations. Therefore, the greater the inflation, the greater the incentive to hoard. Speculation can cause prices to rise or fall. When prices start to fall, people lose confidence. Hoarders start to sell off their goods, while buyers wait and see. As a result, stores become deserted.

Now that foreign trade has been suspended, the supply of goods is decreasing rather than increasing. Everyone knows that the authorities have a strong backing for price controls and have absolute control. However, "cheap goods" are still extremely popular. Looking at the transactions in this recent buying spree, the quantity and value of goods traded are very small. This shows that the buyers are purely genuine consumers, not the hoarders and speculators of the past. Stores are also afraid that their goods will sell out and they will not be able to replenish their stock, so they would rather turn away customers. For example, the Xiefa Bookstore has already sold out of new books. Now they can only buy and sell used books and stationery to survive. All stores see this as a warning. Therefore, the problem lies in the goods themselves.

However, this strange phenomenon of buying sprees is ultimately limited by general purchasing power. If we can raise interest rates on savings as a temporary measure and ease the source of goods as a fundamental solution, it would be more effective than directly restricting sales or implementing a rationing system. Easing the source of goods can promote production, increase reserves, and guarantee the effectiveness of high interest rate policies. This is of utmost importance. If the supply of goods is not sustained, production and reserves will both decrease, and there will be no avenues for banks to lend money. Therefore, raising interest rates on savings would not be feasible in practice.

Furthermore, while the prices of most goods have been reduced this time, the prices of vegetables and public utilities remain high. This is also a noteworthy issue that affects people's perceptions of the current price stabilization efforts.

### Market Trends

The discount rate remained unchanged at 1.2 fen for several weeks after falling to that level. It only increased again to 1.3 fen last weekend. This change occurred during a turbulent week in the market, making it particularly noteworthy.

Public Bonds Soar

Last week, public bonds all rose sharply by 12 yuan to 34 yuan, reaching their highest prices in nearly ten weeks. This sudden change was anticipated by reporters and was also pointed out in the previous issue of this publication. Barring unforeseen changes, there is still potential for future gains. However, the rise has been too rapid, and the foundation may be weak. Although a short squeeze is possible, it is not suitable for the current environment. However, the short-sellers' shift from worry to joy cannot be used as evidence. The short-sellers' hope still lies in new changes occurring outside the market.

Chinese Stocks Mixed

Last week, the Chinese stock market fluctuated depending on the situation of each industry. The overall market was weak, and rising stocks were the exception. However, in terms of the market itself, conditions have become increasingly complete. The movement of idle funds should still aim to settle here. However, the external environment is constantly changing, and the stocks' advancement and retreat may diverge.

New pharmaceutical and financial stocks are in a relatively good situation. Therefore, they bucked the trend and rose last week. The process may be tortuous, but the prospects are bright. Among the new pharmaceutical stocks, Xinyi has broken its record for the price of new currency. Xinsheng and Zhongfa are also following suit. The timing is also good as winter approaches. Among the financial stocks, Zhexing and Shangyin have also broken their records for the price of new currency. This is due to the stimulation of the resumption of business by Jiaotong Bank and the stabilization of people's hearts. The external environment is also still optimistic.

Department store stocks fell sharply because shareholders were afraid that the companies would sell out of goods and their hearts were weak. Although Lihua Company is increasing its stock, it is difficult to avoid this fate. A fire suddenly broke out at China Underwear, which was a major blow to shareholders, who were lamenting. In today's suppression of prices, the retail industry is the first to bear the brunt, and the manufacturing industry is also difficult to escape. If people are arrested in the cloth market, the impact on textile shareholders will be significant, which is a clear example. This is the reason why the Hong Kong stock market is trending downward.

Cotton Yarn and Woolen Fabric

The trend of cotton yarn has turned downward after reaching its peak last week. At the opening of the market last week, the widespread price reduction in the retail industry should have made the situation even worse. However, due to seasonal factors, the market was uniquely prosperous. This attracted the attention of the authorities, who took decisive measures during the week, and the atmosphere became slightly more stable. Compared to early August, the price increase is still significant. The situation in the fabric market is similar. Compared to early August, the price increase is even greater. For example, 12-pound Dragon Head cloth was only about 160 yuan in early August, but even after the rectification, it still reaches about 170 yuan today.

The cotton yarn market has been rectified repeatedly, while the woolen fabric market has been allowed to continue to rise. Therefore, the market price continues to rise, and it was not an exception to the widespread price reduction last week. Observers believe this is abnormal. It is said that the authorities have also taken note of this, so those active in this market should be wary of swift measures.

Cigarette Market Remains Strong

Although there are allocations of cigarettes, the cigarette market continues to ride the wave of price increases and has not weakened due to widespread price reductions. The prices of various Chinese, British, and American cigarettes have risen by 200 to 300 yuan compared to the previous week. The prices of higher-quality cigarettes have risen by more than 500 yuan, and the prices of Japanese cigarettes such as Golden Spear have also risen by more than 400 yuan. There is a sense that hoarding is making a comeback, which is particularly noteworthy.

Western Medicines Remain Stable

The Western medicine market is stable. The prices of outdated medicines are slightly softer, while the prices of seasonal medicines are stable at their original prices. However, the supply in the market is not smooth, indicating that the underlying pressure is not obviously easing.

### Extramural Gossip: Military Control of Over Two Hundred Enterprises

Since December 8th of last year, the total number of British and American enterprises in Central China (excluding the Wuhan area) that have been under military control has reached 169. The first round of military control was implemented on March 28th, involving 60 enterprises, including 21 American enterprises and 38 British enterprises. The second round of control was implemented on May 27th, involving 99 enterprises, including 58 British enterprises and 31 American enterprises. Two Belgian enterprises were also placed under military control at the same time. Since September 4th, another 37 enterprises have been added to the military control list, including 20 American enterprises, 16 British enterprises, and 1 Dutch enterprise. The cumulative total has reached 208 enterprises. This time, the enterprises under control include 15 hospitals, including Renji, Tongren, Guangren, Shangxian Tang, West Maternity and Children, Shanghai Sanatorium, as well as Gulou in Nanjing, Fuyin in Suzhou, Sidu Tang, Gengsheng, Guangji Leprosy in Hangzhou, Xipuren in Wuxi, and Christian Hospital in Nantong.

In addition, there are two companies, Huimin and Fuli Department Store, as well as Huizhong and Anshen Foreign Company. There are also American President Lines, Dutch Java Lines, and British Reis Foundation, Xinchang Machinery Engineering, Yuanhe Foreign Company, Jumei Bristle Factory, Wantai Company, Eurasia Construction Company, Textile Machinery Management Office, Malaya Investment Company, Malaya Real Estate Company, and West Overseas Chinese Sports Field. American Robert Shipping Kimura Company and Jiangsu Real Estate Company are also included. Finally, the British Lanche Theatre and the American Pingan Theatre are also on the list.

### 20% Rent Reduction is Considered Reasonable

The Japanese Consulate General announced that since March 4th of this year, the consulate has adjudicated a total of 148 rent disputes. Before adjudication, the average rent per case was 41.66 yuan in military scrip. After adjudication, the average rent was 33.70 yuan. The average reduction was 7.96 yuan, which is an average decrease of 19%. In terms of the overall situation of rent reduction, the lowest was based on a 60% discount on savings deposits, and the highest was based on an 80% discount. It can be seen that calculating rent based on savings deposits at an 80% discount is what the Japanese authorities consider to be most reasonable.

### New Outlets for the Banking Industry

Everyone is thinking for the bosses of banks and money shops, believing that they have no business to do. Yet, they are still amazed at the thriving resurgence of new banks. I am one of them. However, recently, I had a surprising discovery and realized that bankers are not only not worried, but they also see our worrying for them as the foolishness of women and children, and they are secretly delighted. After the currency change in this city, remittance and transfer between different places have become very profitable for people in the industry due to the differences in the currency system. For example, if Shanghai pays out 100 yuan in savings deposits, it is guaranteed to be able to remit 200 yuan in legal tender to a certain place. However, the exchange rate between legal tender and savings deposits in that place is very different from Shanghai, and there are even cases where it is more expensive. Therefore, money exchangers who mediate between the two can double their profits in a single transaction. At this point, we should suddenly understand.

### Flour Rationing Offices Established

The Shanghai Flour Rationing Association officially began operations on September 1st, with offices located on the fourth floor of 53 Fuzhou Road. Distribution points have been set up in 12 locations in Hongkou, Huxi, and the Nanshi district, including Pingliang Road, Linqing Road, Maohai Road, Wuzhou Road, Wusong Road, North Railway Station, Xinzha Road Bailinan Road, Liping Road, Fangbang Road, Yiding Road, and Daxi Road.

### How Can One Know Honor and Disgrace?

— Lu Ming

When Guan Zhong said "Only when clothing and food are sufficient can one know honor and disgrace" more than two thousand years ago, his understanding of human nature and social realities was profound and insightful. This statement is not only applicable to his time but also to ancient times, the present, and the future.

However, if we look at the current situation in society, we can see that while an ordinary person needs to have enough clothing and food before they can know honor and disgrace, simply having enough clothing and food does not guarantee that a person will know honor and disgrace.

In today's society, those who engage in speculation, hoarding, profiteering, and betraying their conscience can be said to be the worst examples of those who do not know honor and disgrace. But are they not well-fed? Most of them are not only well-clothed and well-fed, but they are also living a luxurious and extravagant life. Precisely because they need to cope with such extravagance, they have no choice but to act against their conscience and engage in those shameless activities that harm society and the nation. Therefore, for a person to know honor and disgrace, they must not only have "sufficient clothing and food" but also be "able to be frugal." Otherwise, even if they are well-clothed and well-fed, it will not be enough to cover the costs of extravagance, and "knowing honor and disgrace" cannot suddenly fall from the sky. It must begin with a frugal and reasonable life!

Children

### Sketches of a Daycare Center

— Mu Qing

The daycare center for working women, sponsored by the Young Women's Christian Association, has been in operation for over a year. Fortunately, my child has had a close relationship with it for a year and a half. After undergoing the training of collective life, this spoiled only child has been trained to be more correct and healthy in his behavior and physique.

Perhaps it was due to my interest that one summer evening, I made a special trip to visit a friend's child who had just entered the boarding section of the daycare center. At this time, they had just finished dinner, and twenty-odd children were being led by a nanny to cool off on the third-floor balcony. At the same time, they were taking turns being taken by another nanny to take a bath. The towels and clothes were all marked with the student number that the children were assigned when they entered the daycare center. This nanny was rushing up and down the stairs, panting, and sweating profusely. I immediately felt at the time, "It's not easy to be a nanny! The children are cool and refreshed after their baths, but what about her?" So I casually greeted her and said, "Mr. Ding, you're too tired! The weather is so hot." She had no complaints on her face. Instead, she smiled and replied to me, "It's nothing, it's okay! Mrs. K!" Then she hurriedly took the child downstairs again. I stared blankly at the disappearance of her back. Suddenly, from a corner of the west window, a gentleman's voice came out: "Good boy, please let the teacher take a look, put some medicine on it, and it won't hurt tomorrow..." Looking back, it turned out that a child had a small heat rash on his hand, and the teacher was gently washing it for him. The kind expression and affectionate tone made me feel that this was truly a loving mother to the children. On the east side of the balcony, there were a group of children sending out innocent laughter. They were sitting and playing organized games, which seemed to bring me back to my own childhood. Two children who were familiar with me saw me and shouted loudly, "K Mom! K Mom!" and ran over to surround me and talk to me. After a while, a teacher shouted, "Little friends! It's seven thirty! Let's go to bed!" So they immediately left me and ran to their own team. Each child carried their own chair and walked inside. After about ten minutes of organized activity, I was left alone on the balcony. I felt, "This is truly the children's real home!"

When I walked into the bedroom, they were already sitting on their own beds, taking off their shoes, drinking water, with the older ones helping the younger ones, giggling and laughing, and joy filled every corner of the room. The nannies were quietly taking care of them. This kind of care is absolutely different from the mothers or maids in the family. In the former, the children are acting on their own initiative, and the nannies are just helping them. In the family, it is the opposite: the children don't move at all, and let others take off their shoes and change their clothes for them, etc., which fosters a habit of dependence in the children. An hour later, I walked to the bedroom window again and peeked in. The little angels were lying on their backs or sleeping on their sides, and they were all sleeping peacefully in dreamland! But between the two rooms, there was a nanny sitting in the dim light reading a book. She noticed my surprise and immediately explained, "This is the night shift nanny. She works from seven thirty to two o'clock in the morning, and then there will be another nanny from two o'clock to seven o'clock in the morning. The responsibility of the night shift is to take care of the children's urination at night or to cover them up if they kick off their blankets, so they don't catch a cold at night."

This spring, the daycare center also added a kindergarten class. Because my child's knowledge and age had exceeded the level of the daycare center, he had to join the kindergarten class. This kindergarten class is different from ordinary kindergartens because after the children enter the center at 8:30 in the morning, they can have lunch, nap, and afternoon tea in the center until they go home at 5:30. This is very convenient for a busy mother.

Some people say, "The daycare center is good, but the monthly fee is too high, and parents seem to be unable to afford it." This is also true, but in today's era of high prices, in order to ensure the health of the children, the daycare center strives to save money on the one hand, but on the other hand, it has to consider the children's nutrition. On the parents' side, a monthly expense of more than one hundred yuan is certainly a considerable amount, but on the daycare center's side, it is still barely maintaining a situation of not being able to make ends meet. I heard that the monthly income of the center is not enough to cover its expenses, and the Young Women's Christian Association has to subsidize one-half of the total expenses.

Finally, when it comes to facilities, to be honest, it is still far from our ideal, especially the space is too small, and it can only accommodate twenty-odd boarding children and thirty-odd day students. It is said that dozens of children who applied this summer were turned away because the building was too small to accommodate them. The daycare center is a meaningful work of the Young Women's Christian Association to help families and women educate children. We do not want it to be confined to that small corner due to economic constraints. We hope it will grow larger day by day, and we hope that those who are enthusiastic about serving society will work together to support the nascent daycare center and help it develop into a large-scale children's welfare movement.

### Idle Talk about Pawnbroking

— Xiao Chaofeng

A Hoarder's Paradise

Running a business with goods is the easiest thing in the world because the price increases are endless and you can be sure to make a profit. But pawnbrokers have all kinds of goods, but the ownership is in the hands of the pawnors. No matter how much the price increases, they will absolutely redeem everything. Pawnbrokers only earn some limited interest that the public considers usurious.

Suppose a pawnbroker invests 100,000 yuan in the first year, which is enough for the year's operating needs and expenses. If the goods double in price in the following year, then the value of the pledges must also increase proportionally. The pawnbroker will inevitably have to add another 100,000 yuan in capital. However, the total profit from official interest, red envelopes, and guaranteed sales profits in the first year will not exceed 20% of the principal. Even if there is a 20,000 yuan profit (?), and this is added to the second year, there is still a shortfall of 80,000 yuan. If we look at the price index in the past five years, and temporarily calculate that it has risen 20 times higher than normal, then the average increase is four times, which means that the currency has depreciated by 80%. The pawnbroker's interest income is definitely not able to keep up with the depreciation of the principal, so it is difficult to compensate. Even if the bosses have tens of millions of private property, they will still lose it all and have to quit. Therefore, before prices stabilize, pawnbroking is just watching the situation and waiting to close down.

My friend opens his Zhu Bajie-like mouth every day, proudly doing hoarding. He told me an unusual but also reasonable thing.

Around mid-June last year, he bought 100 bolts of coarse cloth for 4,000 yuan (at that time, each bolt was about 40 yuan). He pawned them at a pawnbroker for 2,000 yuan, with a 12-month maturity. He then bought another 50 bolts and pawned them for 1,000 yuan, and continued to buy 25 bolts and pawned them for 500 yuan. The total amount of money actually spent was 3,500 yuan, for a total of 175 bolts of coarse cloth. Based on the interest rate of 2.5 fen per month and 2 fen for storage, he redeemed them in early June this year (12 months) for a total of 4,620 yuan in principal, interest, and storage fees. Selling them for 400 yuan per bolt (in early June, each bolt of new currency was above 200 yuan) would yield 70,000 yuan, netting a profit of 65,380 yuan after deducting the principal and interest. In this way, how can pawnbroker bosses ever compete with hoarders?

I never thought that this "long-life warehouse" for the poor would be the best place for hoarders to get what they want! They can both use some funds, and at the same time, the long-life warehouse is their ready-made warehouse. I feel that the name "pawnshop" is too old-fashioned. Now that there is a new service called "redeeming on behalf of customers," why not call "pawnshop" "hoarding on behalf of customers"?

### A Teacher's View of Occupation

— Lin Bao

I remember when we were about to leave university, an old professor whom we respected didn't hold a class in the last hour, but let everyone talk freely. At that time, I asked him why he had been a professor for so long, because from my perspective, as someone who didn't like teaching, this was a very difficult thing to understand. His answer not only enlightened me but also pointed me in a direction in life. He said, "I have been working in the education field for so long and still don't want to change careers because I feel that in this area, I can make the greatest contribution to society. When a person chooses a career, it's not just for money or to maintain a living, but there is also something very important, which is to make achievements and contributions. This can give people a deep sense of satisfaction and joy. It makes people feel truly happy, and that living in the world is not in vain." I will never forget these words because they made me see a new aspect of life.

When we choose a career, I think that if we can all be as sincere and open-hearted as this old professor, considering our own abilities and seeing what society can gain, then our world will definitely become a little better.

### Sharing the Boat in Storms

— He Jia Zhi

(8) What Can One Do?

Wei Yunqing closed the door and scurried inside. His house was not as neatly arranged as the Shi De Hall. When building the house, he would calculate with an abacus. If there were several hundred thousand cash surplus that year, he would build a few more rooms. The following year, because of a dispute with a clansman over a few feet of land for eavesdripping, he won and built a few more rooms, saying, "Leaving the land vacant, you will argue. Now that I have built houses on it, it's as solid as an iron case, can you still argue?" "And the next year, the descendants of the Zhang family were unworthy and dismantled the ancestral hall to sell it piecemeal. The descendants of the Li family were unworthy and dug up the ancestral coffin bricks to exchange for opium. Wei Yunqing went over and shouted, 'It is a crime to dismantle the ancestral hall, and it is an even greater crime to dig up coffin bricks! They should all be sent to the authorities for investigation!' As a result, he offered the lowest price and bought the beams, pillars, bricks, and stones from the Zhang and Li families, and moved them to his own home, building a few more rooms. So there was a narrow alley on the east and a small courtyard on the west. If one speaks well of it, the Wei family's residence is winding and charming; if one speaks poorly, it is a chaotic mess.

In public, Wei Yunqing pretended to be old, constantly mentioning things from thirty or forty years ago. But in places where others couldn't see, he wasn't old at all. Just look at how he scurried inside today, his feet light. He walked into a small courtyard on the west side, muttering to himself, "Cao Ma is such a fool, she doesn't know to lock the wicker gate, how dangerous!" Before he finished speaking, a robust woman dashed out from a low, flat room. This was Cao Ma, who smiled and said, "Master, you've come. I just spooned a bowl of sweet red bean soup from the kitchen, sweetened with plenty of sugar, and took it in." Wei Yunqing stood by the wicker gate, winked at Cao Ma, and asked, "Is she still crying?" Cao Ma pointed toward the room and said, "She's not crying." Wei Yunqing said, "Last night, I heard her muttering curses, who was she cursing?" Cao Ma said, "She wasn't cursing anyone." Wei Yunqing said, "Go and tell her I've come, and see what she says." Cao Ma ran into the room from the doorway. After a moment, she came back out and said, "Master, Miss Bian invites you in." At this moment, Wei Yunqing wished he had a mirror to look at himself. He hurriedly parted his beard on both sides, twirled it a few times, and desperately pulled down the hem of his cotton robe that was only knee-length. His withered body swayed in his short shirt and pants, and then he stepped into the door. (174)
