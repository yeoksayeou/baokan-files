### The 70th Anniversary of This Newspaper

Today is the 70th anniversary of this newspaper. As we take up our pens to write this commemorative piece, a thousand thoughts and tangled emotions stir within us, and we know not where to begin. Recalling this day seventy years ago, when the inaugural issue of this newspaper met the world, and comparing it to today, when this newspaper continues to diligently work in its role amidst a great era, what progress has the world made in these seventy years—this span of nearly a century? What progress has China made? We can summarize it in one sentence: these seventy years have been a great and turbulent era of human evolution—although, from the perspective of historians, this is but a very short span of time.

This newspaper has grown up in this great era. Today, to recount all the major events of the past seventy years, one by one, and present them in a systematic manner, is absolutely impossible due to the limitations of facts and human resources. Furthermore, this arduous task of organization and combing through awaits the pens of future experts. If we were to describe all the past deeds of this newspaper in detail, we would find it somewhat tedious, because a newspaper is a reflection of its time, progressing together with the era. Rather than saying it is the progress of the newspaper, it is better to say it is the progress of the era that is becoming increasingly apparent. The process of a newspaper's progress seems to require no further elaboration. So, what shall we say? Let us simply state our current views. As for what meaningful commemorations should be made for this 70th anniversary, we will carefully plan and prepare for them in the future.

All of us at this newspaper deeply recognize that a newspaper is a public instrument of society. On one hand, guiding public opinion is the inherent duty of a newspaper, but at the same time, a newspaper should also be guided by public opinion. The direct audience of a newspaper is its millions of readers, and the needs of readers for newspapers and the needs of newspapers for readers are reciprocal. What kind of feeling readers have towards a newspaper before they develop trust in it depends on the accuracy and fairness of the newspaper's usual reporting and arguments. Accuracy and fairness are not easily achieved; they must be cultivated through years of refinement and the resonance of countless readers. Therefore, a subtle connection exists spiritually between the newspaper and its readers, like a shadow following a form, mutually echoing each other. Readers must first have their own confidence before they can place their confidence in the newspaper—in other words, readers must also first possess accurate concepts and fair attitudes. From this, we can also understand that the power of a newspaper is the power of society. Therefore, it is said that a newspaper can indeed guide public opinion, but it will also be guided by public opinion at the same time.

Due to the changes in the times, the reporting of newspapers is sometimes even more expected by the world. Looking back at the hardships this newspaper has gone through in the past seventy years, it is difficult to describe them fully. Future generations will view the present as we view the past. What we can pledge to ourselves is that our colleagues dedicate themselves to the news industry with unwavering loyalty. All the hardships experienced in the past will be a source of encouragement and lessons for our future service.

In recent years, society's expectations for newspapers have become even more urgent than in the past, and the contributions newspapers can make to society are also greater than before. If we cannot achieve distant and grand goals in one fell swoop, we may as well start with near and small ones first. The colleagues of this newspaper, aware of our own inadequacies, have in recent years attempted some small services in response to the needs of the times. From the very beginning, we have also adhered to a purpose, hoping to engage in more active promotion rather than negative advocacy. Knowing that what we can do at this time is limited to this, as the saying goes: "Correct its righteousness without seeking its profit, understand its way without counting its merit." The service of our colleagues is to do our best in our respective duties within the scope allowed by the facts.

Our colleagues take working at the newspaper as a lifelong career. The employees in the office have accumulated long years of service, diligently working day and night. The predecessors who worked at this newspaper were like this, and those who are serving here today are no different. This newspaper has a traditional concept, that is, our colleagues believe that working at a newspaper is a sacred cause, and each should have a sense of faith, as sincere as a missionary's devotion to religion. Secondly, one should have self-respect, for only by respecting oneself will others respect you. With the establishment of faith and self-respect, one can then feel great interest in their work and persistently pursue it as a lifelong career. Some say that in these past few years, our colleagues have experienced many hardships and the newspaper has suffered no small number of setbacks. However, these cannot be considered setbacks; they are a kind of tempering. Any valuable undertaking must undergo countless trials and tribulations to achieve bright and great success. Only in this way can it inspire the courage and perseverance of those engaged in the work and demonstrate a determination to never give up, so that the undertaking will be further developed and expanded. Therefore, the past tempering is a kind of test for us and also establishes a great foundation for future revival.

When this newspaper held its 50th anniversary in the 11th year of the Republic of China (1922), it published "The Most Recent Fifty Years." In the 17th year of the Republic of China (1928), when the 20,000th issue was published, a commemorative booklet was also released. In the 21st year of the Republic of China (1932), on its 60th birthday, a summary of the general situation was again compiled and printed as a special booklet. Now, as we gather all the commemorative books and booklets on our desks and read them one by one, we truly have indescribable emotions in our hearts. For example, in the 20,000th issue commemorative booklet, there was a passage that said: "Many people in the editorial department have personally produced issues since the 10,000th issue, and they deeply know that each issue contains the blood of their hearts within it. Whether it is a merit or a crime, accumulating these 20,000 issues is not easy." Now, it has been more than ten years since the 20,000th issue commemoration. The changes in the world and the vicissitudes of life fill us, who continue the work, with infinite emotion. We remember the perseverance of our predecessors in running this newspaper and their extraordinary spirit in maintaining the undertaking amidst difficulties and hardships. We should be even more motivated and make progress, stepping on the established track, taking big strides, and moving forward. This is what we, the colleagues commemorating the 70th anniversary today, use to encourage ourselves and to seek guidance from the readers who care for this newspaper.

As the saying goes, "It is rare for a person to live to seventy since ancient times." Today, this newspaper happily celebrates its 70th anniversary but can only let it pass plainly, inevitably with a sense of "seventy years spent in vain." However, we believe that the more ordinary it is, the more profound its meaning. The life of an undertaking and the life of an individual cannot be compared. Human life values seventy years, but for a great undertaking, perhaps seventy years is only the beginning. The life of a newspaper is cumulative and continuous. This newspaper meets its readers every day, as intimately as family members. We wish to work tirelessly with our readers in the torrent of the times, progressing together to promote the brightness and well-being of the world's humanity. This is the sincere hope for commemorating the 70th anniversary of this newspaper.

Stockholm, Sweden, 28th (Havas Agency) - Military sources here recently analyzed the Eastern Front situation as follows: The situation on the southern front has weakened, but there are still minor skirmishes near Kharkov. There is fierce fighting in the Kursk region. The Red Army continues to advance towards Fatezh, a town northwest of the city that connects to the Orel highway. They have already reached a certain village. The Red Army apparently intends to repel the German forces in Bryansk in order to attack the rear of the Kursk fortress. The Red Army has also established three "bridgeheads" on the Seim River, seemingly intending to attack Kursk from both the north and south. In the Belgorod region, two battalions of the Red Army attacked the German positions in Levkov, without success. The German positions there are extremely well fortified. In the Taganrog region, the Red Army continues to concentrate motorized units, but is only digging trenches in the rear, seemingly adopting a defensive posture without any sign of an offensive. On the Kerch Peninsula, there has been no activity from the German forces in the past 48 hours, but the Red Army launched an artillery barrage yesterday. In addition, the German air force is still actively operating. It is expected that new types of aircraft will also participate in the offensive when it begins. Currently, German aircraft are focusing on bombing railway stations and trains heading to the front lines.

It is reported that a large number of vehicles have been concentrated on the coast of the Sea of Azov, but the strength of the Soviet southern air force does not seem to have increased.

### Debate in British House of Commons on Cripps' Mission to India Concluded

Amery Declares British Goals Unchanged

London, 29th (Reuters) - The House of Commons discussed the mission of Lord Privy Seal Cripps to India yesterday. Secretary of State for India and Burma Amery delivered a speech to conclude the debate, stating that the main purpose of Sir Stafford Cripps' visit to India was to prove the British government's sincerity in resolving the Indian problem. The suggestions he put forward were intended to dispel India's suspicions of Britain. Our ideal is indeed to hope to establish a united Indian federation, but we would rather see it divided and enjoying freedom than to maintain its parts and have them constantly fighting against our country and against themselves. Leaders of all Indian political parties must understand that resolving difficulties is an inseparable responsibility of themselves, not our responsibility. If they understand this, then the right method and the right spirit can arise. Sir Stafford Cripps' mission can be said to have failed in a narrow sense, but in a broad sense, it cannot be said to have been in vain. The proposal of the former Premier of Madras to the Indian National Congress was a promising initiative. If it were not for Sir Stafford Cripps' visit, we would not have seen the hope of such a proposal. Although our proposal has been announced as withdrawn, its goal has not changed.

Stockholm, Sweden, 29th (Haitong Agency) - Cripps delivered a speech in the House of Commons on the failure of his trip to India, and the House immediately discussed the issue. Most members agreed to continue efforts to reach an understanding with India. Some Conservative members even believed that Cripps' trip had achieved considerable results. Labour MP Cuff raised the question of why military power in India could not be handed over to the Indians. He charged that the responsibility for this should be placed on the shoulders of the Indian people and their representatives. During the discussion, Amery said that Cripps' main purpose was to resolve doubts about the sincerity of the British government. Although this trip has failed, its failure is only superficial. He repeatedly condemned the division of Indian leaders and said that Cripps had traveled to India with great difficulty to seek understanding, but the Indian leaders did not move at all. Amery concluded by saying that the British government still considers India to be a supporter of Britain in this war. If the Indian National Congress is willing to share the responsibility of continuing the war in the interim government, the War Cabinet is willing to give part of its power to the party.

### Emperor Receives Tojo

### The Molucca Islands

According to reports from the previous day, Japanese naval forces began their offensive on the Molucca Islands and the northern part of western New Guinea on March 31. By April 19, they had completely occupied all key points in the area. The Molucca Islands, also known as the Spice Islands, once attracted famous explorers, and the profits from the spice trade were used to build noble buildings in Venice, Lisbon, and Bruges, before fading into obscurity. However, the current wealth of the Molucca Islands is not spices, but tin, rubber, and oil. Islands such as Halmahera, Boeroe, and Ceram are large, but not historically famous. In contrast, the islands of Ternate and Banda Naira are famous for their cloves and nutmeg, and Ambon is also well-known, serving as a Dutch East Indies outer naval and air force base.

Regarding the situation in France, the President stated that when France was initially occupied by German forces, the US hoped to maintain a French government that could regain independence, freedom, and equality. The Allied nations will take necessary measures to ensure that no French territory in the world is used for military purposes by the Axis powers. The good people of France must understand the need for this step by the Allied nations. Regarding the procedures to prevent inflation, the President stated that inflation will affect every American.

### US Senator Proposes Establishing a Department of Aviation; Wiley Believes the Fate of the World Will Depend on Air Supremacy

Washington, 29th (Reuters) – Republican Senator Wiley proposed in the Senate yesterday that the war against the Axis powers be intensified in the air.

To expand the air force, the government should establish an Aviation Commission, with a cabinet member as its director-general.

At the same time, another result of the war is that the various industries of the Allied nations will cooperate closely, and the industrial units of the UK, the US, and the Soviet Union must consult and plan together at all times.

### Soviet Foreign Minister's Statement Refuted by Germany

Berlin, 28th (Havas) – After Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov recently issued a note to various countries, strongly protesting the wanton destruction by German troops in the Soviet rear, the German semi-official side issued a statement in response, stating that the note only intends to stir up domestic and foreign audiences. "Scorched earth policy," was it not invented by Stalin? The Red Army itself should be held responsible for the devastation in the Soviet rear. As for the execution of several Bolsheviks by the German side, it must be known that these people are all plainclothes agents, and this does not violate international law.

Berlin, 29th (Haitong News Agency) – Sources from the communications sector stated that the recent note issued by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, accusing German troops of actions in the occupied areas, is another Soviet propaganda tactic. The German diplomatic community stated that the savagery of the Bolsheviks has been known to the world for years, and now they are shamelessly slandering the German army's atrocities, which is the height of shamelessness.

Western Newspaper Comments on the French Political Situation

Madrid, 28th (Havas) – "Weekly Outlook" commented on the French political situation, stating that the French colonial empire can still be loyal to the motherland after France's defeat, which shows the greatness of Marshal Pétain. As for General de Gaulle, although he advocates resistance, the French colonies do not follow him, so his plan has completely failed. Although the colonies are easily influenced by Britain, they are still willing to belong to the defeated motherland, which is all due to their loyalty to Marshal Pétain. Pétain himself has unwavering confidence in his mission, so this loyalty will not change. Therefore, Pétain's attitude can completely change the attitude of the French colonial empire in a matter of hours. It is commendable that the head of a defeated country can still have such great power and responsibility.

At that time, the French government stated that this was a temporary measure and that a concrete solution would be made after negotiating with the Holy See. The reason for the negotiations between France and the Holy See lies in this.

### The Northwest Frontier of India (II)

If the frontier is further divided, it is generally based on the areas along the river basins, such as the Kurram, Tochi, Gomal, and Zhob, which are named after the rivers that flow through these areas.

It is also possible to divide it based on the inhabitants. For example, the Afridi area, inhabited by the Kakae and other tribes, the Turi area centered on the fertile Kurram River basin, and the Waziristan area inhabited by the Waziri and Mahsud tribes. Balochistan, including the Zhob area, is inhabited by the Pashtun and Baloch people, and the name Balochistan is derived from this.

In terms of category, these people all belong to the same lineage. Their appearance, language, and customs are very similar to those of the inhabitants of Afghanistan. However, Afghanistan has a more stable government and rulers with strong tactics. For a long time, this has made the Afghans more law-abiding and orderly than the tribal peoples on the Northwest Frontier outside the administrative boundary.

The tribal areas are notoriously poor and have nothing for invaders to plunder. They did not stay in this area, but went south into prosperous India. Moreover, the tribal areas are difficult to attack, and ancient kings regarded war as a business, seeking only to plunder and occupy large tracts of land for rule.

Therefore, these tribes have always been undisturbed: for example, the Macedonian Greeks described the Satagrae and Apaliretae people of India. From their names and descriptions, it is not difficult to identify these as the nations that call themselves the Khatak and Afridi people today. The period of the Macedonian invasion of India is relatively recent, only a thousand years ago, but the Satagrae and Apaliretae people may have been scattered there for a long time before they were discovered by the Macedonians.

The tribal areas are mountainous and barren, instantly reminding one of the highlands of Scotland, knowing that the Pashtuns there must be brave and good at robbing livestock and looting homes. This is indeed the hereditary profession of the Pashtuns. In their minds, they only know how to plunder, and everything else is not important. However, today, they also understand that this Robin Hood business is not as lucrative as it used to be, so some Pashtuns have learned to drive cars or go to sea to make a living by boat; others have joined the Indian Army, served as soldiers for a while, but then become homesick and reluctant to leave their homeland's towering mountains, so they retire and return to the mountains.

Because the tribal areas have been isolated from the outside world for a long time, the Pashtuns have special characteristics. They never recognize rulers, and even disregard their own tribal chiefs. Pashtun men are only interested in killing members of their own family, regarding the vendetta as a glorious thing. The origin of this internal strife cannot be traced back to ancient times. From this, it can be seen that every Pashtun man is armed, and this kind of life will inevitably lead to the result of valuing oneself and distrusting others.

Below the foothills is a plain, extending to the Indus River. This part belongs to mainland India, but the administration is slightly different: because the disordered mountains on the edge of the plain are inhabited by tribal peoples, this is unavoidable. Police officers in the Northwest Frontier Province and Balochistan are equipped with rifles, and the more important and easily attacked villages are equipped with rifles so that they can be distributed to the strong men in the village to fight back when Pashtuns raid. The Pashtuns in the stable areas are still very similar to their kinsmen in the tribal mountains, but they have become accustomed to being ruled for a long time. The custom of clan vendettas is forbidden by English law and has tended to disappear; most importantly, they have developed a character of trusting others and are very capable as policemen and soldiers.

Travelers to India may land in Mumbai, and what they see of India is somewhat similar to what they imagine - a hot tropical land, full of palm trees and dark-skinned, scantily clad Indians, foreign plants and animals on a haphazard plain, ancient temples, palaces and fortresses, and the roaring of tigers, all of which remind travelers of the Indian scenery described in storybooks. However, what you see in the northwest is definitely not the India you expect. If it is winter, the climate is cold, the mountain tops are covered with snow, the plains freeze at night, and the cold air pierces the skin in the morning and evening.

The people you often meet there are not dark-skinned, but white like Europeans, wearing sheepskin coats, tall, with blue, green, and gray eyes, and reddish-brown hair, lively and alert, more cheerful and smiling than the people elsewhere in India.

Travelers probably value their lives, but if not, the government cares about the lives of travelers and does not allow them to roam freely in the tribal areas. However, travelers can still travel along the tribal areas and even within those areas, comfortably and safely, studying ethnic forms and watching caravans enter India from Afghanistan. These caravans carry blankets on tall camels, trading with India. Travelers can also witness the annual migration of the Powindahs, who are an Afghan tribe that migrates to northern India every time the weather turns cold, leading their families, men, women, old and young. Camels carry packages of goods and furniture, and children with rosy cheeks and small camels and puppies are also carried on the camels' backs. The caravans and flocks of sheep are guarded by tall, fierce dogs as they advance.

### The Detention at Dinghai Has Lasted Over a Year: The Moufu Steamer Returned to Shanghai Yesterday, Will Enter the Dock for Repairs and Prepare for Resumption of Sailing; Change of Ownership for the Haifu and Negotiation on Shipping Routes are Still Underway

The Moufu steamer of the German Lihé Yanghang Shipping Department was seized by the Japanese Navy in the winter of the year before last while sailing to Wenzhou in the Zhejiang waters and taken to Dinghai for detention. It has been detained for nearly a year and a half. It was previously reported that a certain prominent figure had been appointed to negotiate and had obtained permission from the Japanese Navy. It was released in the middle of this month, and the steamer discharged its cargo of grain in Dinghai. After unloading was completed the day before yesterday, it

raised anchor and came to Shanghai.

It entered the Wusongkou at 6:50 AM yesterday and sailed directly to the South Huangpu River. At around 9:00 AM, it passed the Bund Customs and sailed south. Then, it sailed north again from the South Huangpu River and anchored at buoy numbers 22 and 23 in Yangshupu. The steamer was originally the Xin Ningshao of the Ningshao Company's Shanghai-Ningbo line. After the August 13th Incident, it changed to the German flag and continued to operate the Ningbo route. After Ningbo fell, it changed to sail to Wenzhou. Because the Japanese Navy prohibited sailing to the ports of Zhejiang and Fujian, the steamer was detained in Dinghai for violating the Japanese Navy's prohibition order. Now, through the

negotiations and release

to Shanghai of a certain prominent figure, another company will be formed, intending to resume sailing to eastern Zhejiang. However, due to being out of service for a long time, the ship's hull is inevitably damaged and will be docked for repairs within days. The sailing schedule will be determined after the repairs are completed. Furthermore, the Haifu steamer has been purchased by the Yamashita Company, and a company is being organized by a Mr. Xu and others to change the flag. It is said that the change of the ship's name is ready. Regarding the commencement of navigation, because the procedures such as the shipping routes are still in progress, the date of commencement of navigation is not yet determined.

### French Tram and Bus Fares to Increase Starting Tomorrow

The French tram company has decided to increase fares starting tomorrow. According to continuing inquiries from the Datong News Agency reporter, fares will increase more for first-class than for third-class. First-class fares will increase by a maximum of 15 cents, while third-class fares will increase by a maximum of only 5 cents. For example, the number 2 tram line (Xujiahui to the Sixteen Shops) will have a minimum fare of 10 cents and a maximum fare of 35 cents for third class, and a minimum fare of 25 cents and a maximum fare of 60 cents for first class. The number 10 tram line (Lujiazui to the Sixteen Shops) will have a minimum fare of 10 cents and a maximum fare of 35 cents for third class, and a minimum fare of 25 cents and a maximum fare of 55 cents for first class. The number 17 trolleybus line (Great World to Dapu Bridge) will have a minimum fare of 10 cents and a maximum fare of 30 cents for third class, and a minimum fare of 25 cents and a maximum fare of 55 cents for first class. The number 24 tram line (West Gate to Avenue Foch) will have a minimum fare of 10 cents and a maximum fare of 30 cents for third class, and a minimum fare of 25 cents and a maximum fare of 55 cents for first class. As for the number 22 bus line, the minimum fare will be 25 cents and the maximum fare will be 60 cents.

### Last Day for Issuing Subletting Licenses

The issuance of subletting licenses by the Public Works Department ended on Tuesday (the day before yesterday). The total number of licenses issued was 21,230. Compared with the more than 60,000 application forms requested by second landlords, there must be many who have not received licenses. The deadline for receiving licenses is only today. According to reporters, what steps the Public Works Department will take against second landlords who have not obtained licenses is highly noteworthy. It is generally believed that the Public Works Department will inevitably take the following two paths: 1. Consider extending the deadline for obtaining licenses; 2. Directly punish second landlords who have not obtained licenses. However, as of yesterday, the Public Works Department and the subletting license management office had not made any statements. The number of licenses issued on the 27th and 28th is recorded below: On the 27th, 444 licenses were issued in the Central District, 848 in the Western District, 436 in the Northern District, and 463 in the Eastern District, totaling 2,191. On the 28th, 64 licenses were issued in the Central District, 906 in the Western District, 453 in the Northern District, and 514 in the Eastern District, totaling 2,237.

### Hubei Natives Depart for Hankou Today: All Enjoy Half-Price Tickets for Boarding, Re-entry Permits are Still Being Processed as Usual

The Public Works Department continues to process re-entry permits starting from the first of next month. Hometown associations and other social organizations entrusted to do so will also continue to issue re-entry permits as usual, but half-price tickets will no longer be issued starting from the first of next month. However, if the number of people is over 200 and they are returning to the same destination, they can still apply for half-price train or boat tickets. From this, it can be seen that the authorities in the two concessions are continuing their efforts to evacuate the population of Shanghai. The Hubei Native Association in Shanghai, entrusted by the Chinese Evacuation Association, registered a group of fellow villagers. All 200 registered people obtained half-price boat tickets from the association the day before yesterday and boarded the ship yesterday afternoon. The ship is scheduled to set sail from Shanghai to Hankou today.

### Rice Shops in Both Concessions Sell Rice Yesterday: Five Warehouses Release Rice, Rice Shops Extend Rice Selling Hours, Corn will be Picked Up Today and Sold Tomorrow

Rice shops in both concessions sold foreign rice yesterday, which was quite common. Especially in the French Concession, because the number of bags had been increased, the selling hours were extended accordingly, starting from 8:00 AM and ending at 6:00 PM. Although there were many people buying rice, those who were numbered could buy foreign rice. The quantity limit was still one Sheng per person. The corn released by the rice shops in both concessions from Lihé Warehouse, No. 195 Suzhou Road, can be picked up today. Tomorrow, 372 rice shops can sell it universally. The quantity of corn received by the rice shops will remain the same. The Public Works Department's Rice Office continued to designate yesterday the Taikoo Warehouse, Huishan Wharf Warehouse, Dacheng Warehouse, Huachang Warehouse, and Zhejiang Xingye Warehouse, a total of five locations, for rice shops to pick up starting today. This foreign rice can be picked up on Friday and sold at retail on Saturday. The above warehouses release foreign rice and Wuhu rice. Foreign glutinous rice has been sold out.

### Cease Collecting Damaged Small Denomination Notes: Encourage Circulation to Alleviate Small Currency Panic

The Bank Joint Reserve Committee, in order to regulate finance and stabilize the market, has collected about 20 million yuan in old and damaged banknotes from various banks and firms. It has decided to continue collecting them in the future, but hopes that all sectors will not be overly picky about slightly damaged banknotes in order to promote circulation. Recently, in view of the severe shortage of one-yuan notes in the market, which has caused great inconvenience to merchants and residents, in addition to ordering all banks and firms to release and circulate as much of their one-yuan note reserves as possible, it has also submitted a request to the Silver and Money Industry Temporary Joint Association for approval to temporarily cease the collection of damaged one-yuan notes starting tomorrow. A notice has been issued to all banks and firms to accept one-yuan notes that are not severely damaged as much as possible in order to alleviate the small currency panic. In addition, other appropriate measures are being planned, such as increasing the issuance of one-yuan notes by the issuing bank. It is also heard that the relevant authorities believe that the number of one-yuan notes circulating in the market is quite large and there is no reason for such a shortage. It is apparent that someone is deliberately manipulating for profit, and they have already started investigating and taking measures to crack down.

### Today is the 70th Anniversary of This Newspaper

Colleagues Hold a Tea Party to Encourage Each Other

Today is the 70th anniversary of this newspaper. The colleagues, considering the difficult times, did not want to make a big deal of it. Therefore, no announcements were made beforehand. However, in consideration of the difficulty of the past founding and the importance of future responsibilities, in order to create a spiritual commemoration, a tea party was held today by the staff of various departments in the newspaper to encourage each other. As for how to make a meaningful commemoration, it is being solemnly planned and will be announced in the future. The brief history of this newspaper is described as follows:

Brief History of This Newspaper

The Shenbao was born 39 years before the founding of the Republic of China, that is, in the 11th year of Tongzhi, Ren Shen (1872 AD), which is 70 years ago. It was initially founded by a Mr. Maizé, who only published a paper every other day. It was simple and crude. After four months, it published a paper every day, and the paper's format became more advanced than before. When the Vietnam War broke out, the Chinese people relied on the Shenbao to learn about the news, and this newspaper was the first to use telegraphs to report the truth, which was convenient for readers. When the war ended, the reputation of the Shenbao was thus well-known. Later, Mr. Maizé returned to his country due to old age. Before leaving, he reorganized the Shenbao into a company, with Mr. Xi Zimei as the Chinese manager. After five years, in Bing Wu, the Chinese became the owners of the newspaper. At that time, Mr. Xi Zimei had already passed away, and his disciple Zi Pei succeeded him, with full authority. During the Xinhai Revolution, the attention of the whole country was focused on public opinion, especially the Shenbao. In the first year of the Republic of China, Mr. Shi Liangcai, the general manager of this newspaper, took over and has been in charge ever since. For 70 years, we have been honored to have the love and care of readers and the supervision and instruction of society, which has enabled us to promote and develop. The colleagues of this newspaper are committed to inheriting the spirit of the past 70 years in order to expand the infinite future.

The Current Premises of This Newspaper

The old premises of this newspaper were originally on Hankou Road (east of Henan Road), opposite Holy Trinity Church (commonly known as the Red Church), which is now part of the Public Works Department's site. Our humble premises, with three thatched roofs, were not the foundation of today's towering buildings, but "in a small room, with dim lights all night, two or three colleagues wrote together." There was a plaque in the editorial office with the words "Zunwen Pavilion" written by Wu Jing (Ju Tan) from Qiantang in September 1882 (Autumn of Ren Wu in the Qing Guangxu era). The Zunwen Pavilion plaque is still preserved in this museum. The picture on the right shows the old premises of this museum on Wangping Street.

### Lu Yongsheng Arrested for Forging Permits

Lu Yongsheng, a 34-year-old Suzhou native residing at No. 201 Julai Road, was privately forging permits for various places in the interior and selling them for profit. At around 5:00 AM yesterday, detectives from the French General Patrol Station rushed to the address and arrested Lu Yongsheng. More than 20 forged permits and all the seals used for manufacturing were found in his room and taken back to the police station.

### The Young Women's Christian Association Holds a Children's Health Competition

The Shanghai Young Women's Christian Association holds a children's health competition every year to promote children's health and promote health education. This year's competition is sponsored by the Renji Hospital, Tongren Hospital, Children's Hospital, and Hongren Hospital. The children's health competition is scheduled to be held in early May. Each hospital will be responsible for a detailed examination of the children's physical condition. All winners will receive prizes to encourage them. Even the weak can get guidance from doctors to improve their parenting methods. Registration starts today at the Shanghai Nursery School at No. 66 Daxilu, the Vocational Women's Nursery School at No. 6128 Weihaiwei Road, and the Young Women's Christian Association at No. 430 Wuding Road. For all details, please inquire at the association.

### Yarn, Thread, and Sock Dyeing Industry Increases Dyeing Prices Again

Due to the recent scarcity of coal and pigment sources, the yarn, thread, and sock dyeing industry in this city has increased dyeing prices again starting today after consultation with the industry.

### Private Seal Carving: Embezzling Remittances Leads to Arrest

Last month, a person named Shu Changbin remitted 30,000 yuan in national currency from Datai to the Shanghai Bank, stating that the money should be transferred by Han Jiahe, a staff member of the Ningbo branch of the Siming Bank in Ningbo, to Fu Anhua. However, Han privately carved Fu Anhua's seal and withdrew the money from the Shanghai Bank. He then used the money to engage in speculative ventures, losing all of it. Recently, Shu and Fu met in Shanghai and talked about the money. Fu said that he had not received it and negotiated with Han, but to no avail. He then reported it to the Central Police Station. Chinese Detective Tang Zihong and Detective Cheng Renkun arrested Han and took him into custody, pending investigation.

### Arrest of Suspect for Extortion by Intimidation

Yang Feizhang, a Chinese detective inspector, and Xi Youwei, a detective, of the Xinzha Police Station, received a report from an informant the day before yesterday and arrested a suspect, Jiang Qingsong, from Jiangbei, on Hedder Road, Xinzha Road. He confessed that between January and April, he sent threatening letters to Hong Peishou and Hong Peiju, who lived at No. 4, Alley 253, Jiaozhou Road, demanding a payment of 100,000 French currency. He was ordered to be taken into custody, pending investigation and prosecution.

### Corn and Nutrition

— Wuming

Since the supply of rice has become scarce, various grains have appeared on people's tables. In addition to corn, wheat bran, millet, red beans, and soybeans are also used to satisfy hunger. The results of the experiment: many people find it unbearably coarse and difficult to swallow; many people find it has a special flavor and is very sweet. However, in terms of nutritional value, grains are far better than white rice. Therefore, whether you find it difficult to swallow or sweet, once they enter your stomach, they will unknowingly add a layer of steel and concrete to your health fortress. In this way, not being able to eat white rice in a chaotic world is "a blessing in disguise."

Compared with white rice, the main ingredients of corn can be said to be no different. Except that corn has more fat content, other ingredients such as protein, starch, minerals, and fiber are not much different. However, if we compare their vitamin content, there will be significant differences in strengths and weaknesses. Now, let’s list the table below: (per 100 cm)

It can be seen that corn has an absolute advantage in the first three items, which is not an accident, because the essence of white rice is originally in a thin layer of rice skin (bran), which has already been lost after milling. We can also see the richness of vitamins in corn from its color; the yellow of corn, just like the yellow of egg yolks, the yellow of butter, the yellow of soybeans, and the yellow of oranges—are all signs of richness in vitamins. Not only that, but there are also two types of corn, yellow and white, and the white one is far inferior to the yellow one (the values ​​shown in the table above are all yellow corn). This is also like sweet potatoes being better than white potatoes, and carrots being better than white radishes.

The last item in the table above, nicotinic acid, is very low in corn (especially corn flour), but this shortcoming cannot be ignored, because it is also a very important vitamin. A lack of it will cause a disease called "pellagra," which is a disease often suffered by people who eat corn (corn). Last year, there was a Sullivan's "Vitamin B Bread" on the market, which was made with vitamin-enriched flour from the United States. In addition to vitamin B1 (thiamine), it also contained nicotinic acid. (The riboflavin in the table above was formerly known as vitamin B2. Vitamin B may now include more than sixteen nutrients, of which the three mentioned here are the most important.)

Pellagra was formerly known as "Italian leprosy." In the United States, because its symptoms are red inflammations on the skin, it is also known as "red plague." At first, people saw that the disease was very common and often regarded it as a prevalent infectious disease. Later, scientific research revealed that it was caused by malnutrition. Until recently, the truth was completely revealed—the main reason was the lack of nicotinic acid in food. Ten years ago, residents in the Mississippi River basin in the southern United States, due to their relatively hard lives, used corn flour as their main food. Hundreds of thousands of people suffered from this disease, and a total of 70 people died from it every year. Afterwards, the authorities tried to prevent it, but because dietary habits were not easy to change, there were still more than 100,000 patients every year, and it has not been completely eliminated. Pellagra is rarely found in our country, but with years of war and rising prices, ordinary people often suffer from lack of food, and the issue of nutrition is naturally out of the question. Therefore, this disease is very likely to occur; recent reports from hospitals in Shanghai and other places have confirmed the existence of this trend.

The symptoms of pellagra are quite complicated. Generally speaking, there are several of the following:

Red inflammations on the skin, most obvious on the back of the hands, wrists, and lower arms.

Inflammations: stomatitis, scrotitis.

Gastrointestinal disorders: loss of appetite, diarrhea, etc.

Mental disorders: In severe cases, even mental confusion, frenzy, and fainting.

A person who eats corn rice should seek medical treatment or improve their diet if they find that they have a tendency to the above symptoms. If the disease is severe, there is no other way to survive except to use nicotinamide and other drugs for emergency treatment.

To prevent problems before they occur, people who generally eat pure corn rice should pay special attention: they must eat more green vegetables and beans every day, and it is better to eat some meat. If corn is mixed with white rice or beans to cook rice, its nutritional value will be higher than eating corn or white rice alone, because if white rice is eaten alone without getting enough thiamine from other sources, there is a risk of beriberi. In addition, it should be mentioned that generally people think that foreign rice is not as good as "rice," which is not very correct. From the perspective of vitamin content, foreign rice is only better than "rice," although not much better. However, no matter what kind of white rice it is, the trace vitamins it only preserves are contained in the mixed rice flour. If it is washed too thoroughly, it will be completely lost. Similarly, when red beans and soybeans are soaked in cold water for a long time, a large amount of vitamin B is leached out, and this water cannot be discarded. All of this must be paid attention to by those who pay attention to nutrition.

### A New Invention in Transportation: The Austin-Style Bicycle, As Light and Comfortable As a Car

In recent months, the sources of various fuels have been blocked, and the operation of vehicles has become a problem. The operation of buses and private cars has been suspended one after another, and the running time and number of trams have also been reduced. As a result, bicycles have become popular for a while. General technical experts have studied them, carefully designed them, and various new types of vehicles have been constantly introduced to the market. For example, bicycles are equipped with seats, either on the side or behind the car, and there are even three-wheeled and four-wheeled ones, emerging one after another.

Bicycle Canopy Car

Now, Mr. Fang of China Automobile Company has recently invented a new type of automobile-style bicycle, which is shaped like an Austin small car. The bottom is equipped with four wheels, the chassis is made of lightweight steel bones, and the body is made of high-quality, strong, lightweight lacquered cloth, which is not afraid of wind and rain. Its structure is based on the principle of pedal rickshaws and has been transformed.

Like a Car

The driving method is also no different from that of a car. It is equipped with a steering wheel on top. When the driver turns, he can easily transfer. Anyone can do it. It is even more economical to drive yourself. In addition to the driver, one person can sit side by side in the car. The bottom is equipped with a pedal chain to help the driver pedal, and the car travels faster. The front can accommodate two adults, and the rear compartment can carry two children.

Special Production for Five Years

According to the inventor, Mr. Fang, the company's factory is located on Avenue Road. It has been approved for special production for five years. The first batch of cars has been launched and has received Notice No. 44 from the Public Works Department. Currently, there are many people ordering from the company. In about a month, there may be forty or fifty cars appearing on various roads. Unfortunately, rubber tires are not easy to collect in large quantities, which will become a problem in the future.

Light and Comfortable

The advantages of this car are that it is light, fast, safe, the seats are comfortable, there is no suffering from bumps, and the appearance is beautiful, like a car. The selling price is about 6,000 yuan per car, and the fee paid to the notice is only 150 yuan per half year, which is much cheaper than car donation fees.

New Type of Passenger-Carrying Carriage Bicycle

### Selling Impure Oil: Westerner Fined, Must Post Reason for Fine on Shop Front

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury" reported that a novel judgment was made in court the day before yesterday. The person in question was a Westerner, Caraghilicos Grigorios, the owner of the Vassos Store on Avenue Joffre, who was fined 500 yuan for selling impure olive oil and ordered to post the amount of the fine and the reason for the fine on the shop's window glass, so that passers-by could see it at a glance. It was found that the offender sold oil that actually contained peanut oil as pure olive oil. During the trial, he still quibbled that the oil was bought in 1940 (the year before last) and had not been mixed with anything. However, the Public Works Department's chemical test results proved that it was mixed with a certain amount of peanut oil, so the above judgment was made public.

### This City's Hotel Industry Stops Collecting Refugee Donations

When tourists stay at hotels in this city, in addition to paying the room rate, they also have to pay a refugee donation. This has been implemented for three years and six months. Now, because the Refugee Association has repatriated all the refugees, the industry has decided to stop collecting the donation starting from May 1st.

### Another Batch of British and American Nationals Will Arrive in Shanghai from Guangzhou: A Total of About Seventy People Assembling for Evacuation

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury" reported that Kawasaki, a spokesman for the Japanese embassy, stated at a press conference the day before yesterday that 124 British and American nationals would come to Shanghai from South China on April 23rd, preparing to evacuate from Shanghai at the end of May, including about 30 diplomatic and consular personnel. The spokesman continued, "Another batch of 70 people are also scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from the Guangzhou area within days, so that they can be included in the 1,000 British and American nationals who will be exchanged with the Japanese in Laurenço Marques. After mid-May, other batches of British and American nationals who have departed from the interior of North China will also arrive here to assemble for evacuation. Mr. Kawasaki reiterated that a batch from South China was staying at the Cathay Hotel and the American School, but the Japanese authorities were still encountering difficulties in finding accommodation for these evacuees.

### Kidnapping of Gu Huanzhang Case: Four More Criminals Apprehended

Gu Huanzhang, owner of Gongyi Tannery, was kidnapped by bandits once two years ago. Afterwards, the police apprehended several criminals involved in the case for interrogation and prosecution. Recently, Wang Jiaju, chief detective of the Jiaxing Road Police Station, along with detectives Yang Xinzheng and Dong Qingquan, discovered that some kidnappers were hiding in room 318 of the Da Zhonghua Hotel on Yuqiaqing Road. Yesterday around 2:00 AM, they secretly went to the Da Zhonghua Hotel and arrested four suspects, namely Hu Baosheng from the local area, Yang Jiankang from Pudong, Xu Zhimin, and Li Wanshan. At the time, Chen Cuiying, a singer from the Diaochang Xiangdao agency, was also in the room, so she was also taken to the police station for investigation and prosecution.

### Resale of Low-Priced Flour Leads to Imprisonment

Liu Herong, from Jiangbei, residing at No. 27, Lane 1708, North Chengdu Road, operated a pancake stall there. Having registered with the Public Works Department, he obtained low-priced flour at a subsidized price of 90 yuan per bag in legal tender. However, Liu sold a portion of the flour to others at 130 yuan per bag. This was discovered by the Food Administration, which reported it to the Central Police Station. Hua Tanmu (Chinese detective) Lang Zuyin arrested Liu, and after investigation, the charges were confirmed, resulting in a sentence of three months' imprisonment as a warning.

### French Police Conducted a Search of Residences Yesterday

Yesterday around 6:00 AM, the French Concession Police Department dispatched a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives to a certain number in the lane next to Jiu Yu Tang on Jiale Road and Pingji Road. They searched the premises and found a large quantity of morphine, arresting two male and female suspects.

### Two Weeks of the Aurora University Drug Exhibition: A Summary

The National Medicine Exhibition held by the Aurora University Museum has been open for two weeks, and people from all walks of life have shown great interest. The number of visitors has increased in the past week, with groups and schools visiting together. The organizers of the museum have also added public performances of drug experiments and academic lectures by specialists to increase the interest of visitors. Last Friday's pharmacology demonstration used the heart of a revived rabbit to demonstrate the effects of several national medicines. It was held in the physiology classroom of Aurora University, with nearly 200 attendees, including colleagues from the medical and pharmaceutical fields and students from various schools. The experimenters provided explanations during the performance. On Saturday, the Pasteur Institute gave a detailed account of its research on national medicines, and encouraged domestic researchers of national medicines to embrace the spirit of Pasteur. It is reported that the third week (May 2nd) of the conference will feature a lecture by Dr. Wu Yunrui on Saturday on "Humble Opinions on Researching National Medicines." The lecture in the fourth week will be given on Sunday, May 10th, by Dr. Huang Shengbai on "Li Shizhen's Phonology." The conference authorities have stated that the lectures are open to the public and do not require tickets. The location is Room 29, first floor, New Building of Aurora University, No. 223 Luban Road, opposite the museum. The host, Dr. Wang Xingyi, also expressed a willingness to welcome the participation of academic groups or schools. Those who wish to visit the pharmacological experiments can submit a written request as a group, specifying the date, and another one or two sessions will be arranged. Dr. Wang also stated that since the opening of the drug exhibition, it has received the sympathy of the medical community and the public in promoting research on national medicines. Some have misused it for personal promotion, which is a complete misunderstanding of the meaning of this exhibition.

### Account Manager of Yongxing Foreign Firm Arrested for Embezzlement

On April 4th, Yongxing Foreign Firm, located at No. 95 Museum Road, instructed Shen Yusheng, an assistant account manager from Suzhou, to cash a check from the Guohua Bank for 61,880.37 yuan in national currency. However, after receiving the cash, Shen disappeared without a trace. Yongxing Foreign Firm reported the incident to the Central Police Station for investigation and arrest. Based on information provided by Chinese detective Feng Qiyou, Shen was apprehended at Room 216 of the Far East Hotel in Beicang Bridge, Suzhou, and brought back to Shanghai. Shen confessed that Yu Qinqi, an account manager from Pinghu working at the same firm, was also involved. Yu was then arrested at No. 63, Lane 370, Malan Road. The following items were confiscated from Shen and Yu: 1,410 Japanese yen, 2,995 Central Reserve Bank notes, 4,181 yuan in legal tender, one watch, and one gold ring. All items are temporarily being held at the police station, pending investigation and verification of the remaining embezzled funds.

### Extorting an Aunt Leads to Punishment

Yu Sunshi, a local resident of No. 30, Fuxu Fang, Fuxu Road, in the French Concession, is the wife of the late Shanghai tycoon Yu Baoqing. Her nephew, Xu Longyuan, did not pursue a proper occupation and indulged in vices. He repeatedly asked his aunt, Sunshi, for loans, not just once, and the amounts were not small. Recently, he came up with a new idea. He colluded with ruffians Yu Guisheng, Yu Caibao, and Fan Xifang in an opium den. Using a certain party's name, they falsely accused Yu Sunshi of secretly storing weapons buried under the Fahua Cemetery, claiming that they needed to be investigated. Using this as a pretext, they extorted money from Yu Sunshi. Sunshi had already given them 500 yuan twice, but Xu and the others were still dissatisfied. They then called Yu Sunshi from the Dadong Hotel, demanding 100,000 yuan. Inspector Gui Baoquan, detective Zhou Buguang, and detective Li Shuren of the French Police Department investigated the case and rushed to arrest Xu, the two Yus, and Fan. The details of the case were reported in the newspapers. The case has now been concluded, and the verdict was handed down yesterday. The defendants were found guilty of extortion. Yu Guisheng was sentenced to ten months' imprisonment, Yu Caibao to nine months' imprisonment, and Xu and Fan were each sentenced to four months' imprisonment as a warning.

### Ma Qiwang and Ma Shaomei's Wedding

Yu Hualong and Lan Fengyun, both famous lawyers in Shanghai, served as witnesses. Ma had many friends and guests filled the room, making it a grand occasion.

Today's newspaper was dispatched at 6:40.

### Preface to "A Historical View of the Book of Changes" (1)

— Hu Pu'an

Interpreting the Book of Changes from a Historical Perspective: A Groundbreaking Idea in Chinese Classical Studies

When Pu'an was thirteen or fourteen years old, he was reading Zhu Xi's "Original Meaning of the Book of Changes" of the Song Dynasty. One day, he asked his tutor: "In the sixth line of the Kun hexagram, it says, 'Dragons fight in the wilderness, their blood is black and yellow.' Ordinary blood is red, so why is dragon blood black and yellow? And what exactly is a dragon?" Someone said, "The dragon fight has been going on for a long time, and the blood has dried, hence the black and yellow color." The tutor could not answer and simply said, "Dragons are mythical creatures, and they do not exist now." Another day, he asked: "The hexagram statement of the Li hexagram says, 'Treading on the tiger's tail, it does not bite the person, good fortune.' But the sixth line says, 'Treading on the tiger's tail, it bites the person, misfortune.' In the same hexagram, why does the tiger sometimes bite and sometimes not bite? What is the reason?" The tutor said, "Not biting the person leads to good fortune, biting the person leads to misfortune." He asked again: "Boy and girl are common terms. The first line of the Guan hexagram says, 'Childlike viewing, the way of the petty person.' The second line says, 'Peeping viewing, the girl is auspicious, but also shameful.' So, viewing a boy is just the way of the petty person, and peeping at a girl is a shameful act. The sacred texts have already said this." The tutor angrily said, "How can the sacred texts say such a thing?" He replied, "Men and women mix essence, and all things are created. Is this not a sacred text? What exactly is essence, and how is it mixed? After mixing, how can it create all things?" The tutor was extremely angry and remained silent, and his anger increased. It happened to be dinner time, and he took a piece of salted meat and ate it. He sighed and said, "The sacred texts are truly untrustworthy." The tutor asked why. He replied, "The fifth and sixth lines of the Shi He hexagram say, 'Biting dried meat, obtaining gold.' If this piece of meat contains gold, wouldn't that be a small fortune?" The tutor said, "You are truly a bookworm," and laughed it off.

From then on, he had a belly full of doubts about the Book of Changes and stopped reading it. Before the age of thirty, he had not seen any book about the Book of Changes except for Zhu Xi's "Original Meaning of the Book of Changes." However, he heard people say that the Book of Changes was a mysterious and unknowable book. After the age of thirty, he began to read Wang Bi's Commentary on the Book of Changes, Kong Yingda's "Correct Meaning," "Collated Interpretations of the Book of Changes," Cheng Yi's "Commentary on the Book of Changes," Li Dingzuo's "Collected Explanations of the Book of Changes," and Li Daoban's "Collected Explanations with Annotations of the Book of Changes." He then vaguely understood that there was a distinction between the Han and Song schools of Yi studies. Wang Bi's Yi studies differed from the Han school, and the Song Confucians did not follow it either, except that Cheng Yi's commentary had some similarities. However, although he had read four or five kinds of Yi, he was still ignorant of the main meaning of Yi. So, he put it aside and did not read it for several years.

In the fifth year of the Republic of China, Hang Xinzai was released from Yuan Shikai's prison, claiming that he had obtained the true teachings of Yi studies in prison. In the seventh and eighth years of the Republic of China, Xinzai gathered members of the National Assembly to lecture on Yi in Guangzhou, and the trend of lecturing on Yi became extremely popular for a time. In Shanghai, there was a Zhouyi Society, and the lectures they compiled attributed everything, from submarines to bombers, to the Book of Changes. In the superstitious era, the Book of Changes was used as a talisman to scare ghosts, but now it is used as a weapon to beat people. Although this kind of strange saying was not seen in Xinzai's book, constitutional monarchy was used as an image of the same person, democratic constitutionalism was used as an image of great possession, the seven colors of sunlight were seen in the image of Ben, and microorganisms changing matter were seen in the image of Gu. Qian's position is in the south, Qian is ice, which means that it was known early on that there was the Arctic Ocean and the division of chemistry, which is in line with the images and numbers. These kinds of sayings are often seen in Xinzai's Yi book.

He has always had a curious heart, and was stimulated by these kinds of strange sayings. So, his father aroused his desire to read Yi, but he gained nothing for a long time. His father then suddenly realized, "Even if there is such a saying, it is just a coincidence. Even if there is a match, it is just a general outline. It can never be read as a science book, and it has no scientific value." But what exactly is the Book of Changes? It is neither a chronicle of the Shangshu, nor a chronicle of the Spring and Autumn Annals, neither a poem in words, nor a rite in systems. In the end, he had to treat it as a book of divination. The Book of Changes' divination is seen a lot in the Zuo Zhuan, but unfortunately, there is no way to verify the ancient divination methods. So, he took several kinds of Yi from the "Corrected and Continued Qing Classics Explanations" and read them, thinking that he would be able to find some ancient methods in the books of Yi scholars of the Han Dynasty. If he didn't read it, he wouldn't. But when he read it, the sayings of hexagram qi, messages, bigrams, Na Jia, Shiying, Feifu, noble and base, Zhenhui, and Meng qi became confusing for a while.

At that time, he was teaching at National University. Students asked to open a course on the Book of Changes, which was still popular at that time. If he used Hang Xinzai's book as a textbook, and then embellished it with strange explanations, it would be enough to cater to the tastes of ordinary students. He secretly disagreed with this. So, he compiled a lecture note on the Book of Changes, consisting of twenty-three chapters: Introduction, Naming, Explanation of Doubts, On Hexagrams, On [missing word], On Images, Ten Wings, On Interlocking Bodies, On Changed Hexagrams, On Proportion, [missing word] Chart, [missing word] Reading Yi, Schools of Yi Studies in the Two Han Dynasties, Schools of Yi Studies in the Three Kingdoms, Jin, Southern and Northern Dynasties, Sui and Tang Dynasties, Schools of Yi Studies in the Song, Yuan, and Ming Dynasties, Schools of Yi Studies in the Qing Dynasty, Philology of the Book of Changes, Rhetoric of the Book of Changes, Philosophy of the Book of Changes, Ritual Education of the Book of Changes, [missing word] History and Geography of the Book of Changes, [missing word] Art of the Book of Changes, [missing word] Bibliography for Studying the Book of Changes. He compiled this lecture note without adopting strange sayings, nor adding his own opinions, so that after students read this lecture note, they could recognize the Book of Changes based on their own academic abilities. Except for the introduction chapter, from naming to the nine chapters on proportion, are the important parts of the Book of Changes, taking the sayings of various schools and compiling them, so that scholars can know the general outline of the Book of Changes. The chapter on charts is based on the sayings of Hu Wei and Wan Sitong, that the Hetu, Luoshu, Prior Heaven, Posterior Heaven, sixty [missing word] hexagrams, square and round charts are the learning of Shao Kangjie, not Yi learning. From the reading method of Yi to the five chapters on the schools of Yi studies in the Qing Dynasty, readers can roughly understand the changes in Yi studies. The six chapters from the philology of the Book of Changes to the art of the Book of Changes are the methods he used to organize old Chinese books. Whether it is the Book of Documents, the Book of Poetry, the Three Rites, or the Spring and Autumn Annals, all are organized using this method. Unfortunately, only the Yi Jing studies and the Book of Poetry studies have been done. The other three books, the Book of Documents, the Three Rites, and the Spring and Autumn Annals, can only be expected of future generations. The last chapter is an appendix to the bibliography on the study of the Book of Changes. But this kind of plan was a failure. Most students like novel sayings. His lecture note had neither novel sayings nor could it say what kind of book the Book of Changes was. After learning it, what was the use? Students often asked him, and he really had no words to answer. (To be continued)

### National Debt Plummets Through Four Barriers: Type B Drops 14 Yuan Lower Than Type A, An Unprecedented Occurrence Since the Issuance of Unified National Bonds

The over-the-counter market for national bonds continued to decline yesterday. Trading was relatively stable at the beginning because the drop the day before was already significant, and many people had short positions to cover. Therefore, Type C opened at 61 yuan and hovered for a long time. Later, it recovered slightly. When Type C reached 0.45 yuan, selling began to emerge, increasing as it went, and the 60 yuan mark was broken. Type E initially traded at 7.70 yuan and hovered at 7 yuan for a long time. After breaking 7 yuan, it went downhill, breaking into 6 yuan, 5 yuan, and then 4 yuan. It broke through four barriers in one day, with the price plummeting by as much as 4 yuan. This can be described as a rare catastrophe in the bond market. This further proves that the outflow of this kind of physical goods cannot be underestimated. Long positions will inevitably retreat. It is estimated that the selling has been going on for two or three weeks, totaling more than 20 million yuan. The remaining strength is unknown, but it is enough to prove the enthusiasm of buyers. The sale of 20 million yuan worth of goods has a definite power to digest in this market, and cannot be taken lightly. Yesterday, Tongli was still the leading seller, constantly releasing spot goods, causing the market price to drop in a straight line without looking back. Type E suffered the most severe drop, with a single transaction falling by 4 yuan. The closing price was 5 or 6 yuan lower than Type C, which was already unusual, and even 0.6 yuan lower than Type D and 14 yuan lower than Type A. This is an unprecedented occurrence since the issuance of unified national bonds. Market buyers were scattered and not organized, with Lianyi and Lianhe being slightly more successful. Hongda, Chengkang, and Yongkang also bought in, while Xie Kang and Shunli sold out and then bought in. In addition to Tongli, Jiufeng, Yichang, Xinfeng, Dazhong, and Hongxing also sold, but the amounts were not large. The reason was entirely due to the pressure from spot goods. Before this route is completely cleared, even if there is a recovery in the market, it will inevitably be frustrated. As a result, the market price fell unevenly. Type A only fell by 1.7 yuan, while Type E fell by as much as 4 yuan. The total turnover was about 1.4 to 1.5 million yuan. A simple table is listed below:

### Hua Shares Advance Without Retreat

Yesterday, Hua shares advanced without retreating, and the momentum remained strong. Yong'an Company was at 55 yuan, up 2.5 yuan. Xinxin was at 73.5 yuan. China Underwear rose from 23.75 yuan to 25.75 yuan. Xinya Pharmaceutical (new) was at 37 yuan. Zhongfa (new) traded at 62 yuan. Shenghua rose 1.75 yuan to reach 24 yuan, with few sellers. Xinya Materials was at 20 yuan. Zhonghua Bookstore was at 116-117 yuan. Yongxiang was at 25 yuan. Shijie (new) was at 75-76 yuan, up 4 yuan. Hongxing Weaving was at 190 yuan. Tianchu MSG was at 360 yuan. Kangyuan Canning was around 38 yuan. Zhabei Water [missing word] had risen to 17.25 yuan.

### Unstable Hearts: Gold Prices Fluctuate

The over-the-counter market for cash gold first rose and then fell, with the 22,000 yuan mark being re-entered. This was due to the resurgence of a certain gold shop and the silver building industry, as well as speculative selling by the Tianjin gang. It is clear that everyone's hearts are unstable. The initial trading price in the morning was 22,300 yuan, 100 yuan higher than the afternoon price. At that time, under the buying momentum of the gold and securities gangs, it rose to 22,500 yuan. Another securities firm acted on behalf of the Tianjin gang to sell off, and a certain gold shop, cash shop, and the silver building industry followed suit, causing the price to gradually decline to 850 yuan. At 11:25 AM, it retreated to 21,650 yuan. Later, there were few sellers, and the price at noon had risen to around 21,850 yuan, 50 yuan higher than the previous day's noon price, but 350 yuan lower than the afternoon price.

The price of gold ornaments per tael in silver shops was first lowered to 2,250 yuan by Daxiang counterparts, and then to 2,300 yuan, a flat [price], (a 300 yuan reduction for purchases). Patterned silver was listed at 18 yuan. The black market price was between 16.5 yuan and 17 yuan. Silver coins were bought at 9.5 yuan apiece, but selling required 10 yuan.

### The Value of Currency Changes: What is the Reason?

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw stable prices for British and American gold pounds, with the former remaining at 480 yuan and the latter remaining at 490 yuan. US dollar bills were being bought at 35 yuan. Hong Kong dollar bills continued to rise to 5.3 yuan, with large bills being 0.1 yuan lower. Military currency suddenly surged, opening at 7.39 yuan in the morning, rising to 0.45 yuan after opening, then suddenly falling to 0.35 yuan. In the afternoon, it suddenly rose to 7.6 yuan, a sharp increase of 0.25 yuan compared to the previous day.

The discount rate for cross-clearing bills rose from 11 yuan to about 30 yuan per thousand yuan, an increase of 20 yuan. The money industry association's interbank lending rate remained at 0.13 yuan. The premium for Central Reserve Bank notes was 0.35 to 0.36 yuan per yuan, which was also significantly different from the previous day. Therefore, yesterday's currency and banknote market was all on the rise.

### Bill Exchange

Changes After the Original Method is Restored: The Shanghai Banking Association Joint Preparatory Committee (i.e., the bill exchange), has decided to restore the timed bill exchange system from May 1st (i.e., each exchange bank will send personnel with bills to the exchange at the beginning of the exchange time to handle bill exchange matters), and has formulated 18 articles of measures, which are summarized below: From the date of implementation of these measures, the timed bill exchange system originally implemented by the association before September 15th, 30th year of the Republic, shall be restored immediately. All specially contracted banks with account numbers before No. 42 shall still be called "exchange banks", and those with total numbers of No. 50 and branch numbers shall still be called "trustee exchange banks". The daily bill exchange time is 2:00 PM from Monday to Friday, and 12:15 PM on Saturday The exchange of bills shall be carried out separately according to the following currency types: Central Reserve Bank notes, cash, cross-clearing. The remaining articles are generally similar to the measures before September 15th, 30th year of the Republic, and are omitted due to the length of the text.

### Yarn Rises with Raw Cotton

### Factory Cloth - Rising Straight Up, Only Buying, No Selling

Factory Cloth: Yesterday, due to the continuous increase in yarn prices and Eastern cloth prices, both inside and outside hoarders were only buying and not selling, making the supply of goods even tighter. As a result, the prices of all cloths reached new highs. Sixteen-pound Earth brand coarse cloth rose from 260 yuan to 265 yuan, Flying Goose 250 yuan, eight-pound Zhenzhong 138 yuan, fourteen-pound One Deer 239 yuan, twelve-pound Earth brand fine cloth 238 yuan, Fugui fine cloth 225 yuan, factory orders 190 yuan, Fugui fine twill 200 yuan, spot goods 198 yuan, Peach Blossom Ladies' Forest 356 yuan, Chick Prosperity Dream 355 yuan, all had transactions opening.

Suddenly, the buying interest in the market became strong, and prices rose straight up. The noon closing price was around 280 yuan.

### Rice Market Speculation - Unprecedented Highs

Yesterday, there were rumors that early and late rice speculation suddenly became expensive. It has been rumored for a long time that rice prices would increase by 5 or 6 jiao soon. Du rice took advantage of the public's anxiety about insufficient rice supply and took the initiative to raise prices by 130 yuan consecutively in recent days, which was truly shocking to hear. In the French Concession, rice prices rose from 518 yuan to 520 yuan, then to 525 yuan, 528 yuan, and finally to 530 yuan, directly reaching 535 yuan. In the British Concession, prices rose from 543 yuan, 545 yuan, to 550 yuan. Thick japonica rice was 535 yuan to 545 yuan, an increase of about 120 yuan compared to before. Throughout the day, prices fluctuated, and the difference between the lowest and highest prices was as much as tens of yuan, a misfortune for the people's food supply.

### Soybean Prices Rise

The hoarding and selling of soybean cakes continued to progress. Inland buyers inquired first, and speculators followed. Therefore, the market was quite brisk, and prices were raised by another three or four yuan. Specifically, Lizi soybean cake for March warehouse orders were 2,000 pieces, priced at 65.5 yuan to 67.5 yuan. Fengji soybean cake for April warehouse orders were 500 pieces, priced at 65.5 yuan.

June old warehouse orders were priced at 56 yuan to 57.5 yuan. New orders for the month were priced at 66.5 yuan to 68.5 yuan.

The arrival of soybeans remained stagnant, and people continued to expect prices to rise. Prices were raised by about five yuan. Specifically, Pudong Du soybeans were 100 bags, priced at 160 yuan. Pinghu Du soybeans were 30 bags, priced at 250 yuan. Pinghu Qing soybeans were 50 bags, priced at 190 yuan. Tianjin red beans were 50 bags, priced at 248 yuan to 258.5 yuan.

Orders for the end of May were priced at 122-123 yuan.

### Hunan Lotus Seeds Loosen

Ordinary Hu lotus seeds sold by the Yue gang were priced at 700 yuan. Lanxi white lotus seeds were scarce, priced at 800 yuan compared to ordinary ones.

### Galangal Recovers

The price of galangal recently decreased by hundreds of yuan due to a larger supply. However, after investigating the production costs and other expenses, it was found to be unjustified. Yesterday, the market selling price improved by 50 yuan, but it is temporarily uncertain.

### Switzerland - A World Paradise

— Xuan

In this world war full of flames, almost all countries in the world have been dragged into the whirlpool of war. A few countries, such as Turkey, still maintain neutrality, but they are closely related to the war and may inevitably participate at any time. Only Switzerland, located in Europe and surrounded by great powers, has always stayed out of the conflict, maintaining a clean land and living up to its reputation as a world paradise. Two years ago, when bloody battles were raging around Switzerland, tens of thousands of French and Polish soldiers fled into Switzerland. Fortunately, although Switzerland is small, it has a strong and respected army that detained all the French and Dutch soldiers who crossed the border and strictly guarded the border, striving to maintain neutrality, so that it could safely survive the huge waves of the war.

We may as well take a tour of Switzerland in our imagination, but this is not a time for sightseeing, but to learn something about the Swiss army. When entering Switzerland at a checkpoint, you can see two soldiers guarding it, wearing gray-green military uniforms and helmets with special styles. One of them is obviously a farmer, with rough hands and feet and a strong physique; the other looks like a young student. At this time, tourists should ask the Swiss guide: "How many years must Swiss citizens serve in the military in peacetime, or is there a professional army?" Let's listen to how the guide answers:

Switzerland is a small country and cannot afford to maintain a standing army. It only has a militia system. The constitution stipulates that the basic duty of citizens is to serve a period of military service. If they are physically unfit or overseas, they must pay taxes in lieu of service. If officers can understand the feelings of soldiers, the relationship between the two parties will be extremely harmonious. Therefore, Swiss citizens serving in the military are treated equally, regardless of class. The two guards at the checkpoint obviously have different social ranks, but in the army, wearing the same military uniform, they must obey orders.

"The language and religion of the Swiss people also differ. About 71 percent speak Swiss German, 21 percent speak French, 6 percent speak Italian, and 1 percent speak Romansh (derived from ancient Latin). 57 percent of the people believe in Protestantism, and 41 percent believe in Catholicism. However, they are united by the common purpose symbolized by the Swiss flag.

"The Swiss military system is different from other countries. It is composed of men from all over the country, maintaining the highest defense strength with the lightest burden. Young people who reach the age of 20 must enlist in the army and receive four months of rigorous training, learning to use various modern weapons. In the following 12 years, they will hold annual exercises eight times, each time for 18 days. At the age of 32, they will be assigned to the second-line reserve army. Until the age of 40, they must undergo two more exercises, each time for 18 days. From the age of 40 to 48, they belong to the National Defense Army, and are only called for inspection for one day a year in peacetime. The Swiss government recently issued an order that, in the event of general mobilization, the military service age will be extended from 48 to 60, and people of the soldier class must serve for at least 32 years.

"Citizens of the soldier class are issued firearms and stored in their homes. During mobilization, they only need to return home, take off their casual clothes, put on their military uniforms, and carry their equipment to assemble. Therefore, during the First World War in 1914, the mobilization of the Swiss army was the first to be completed. In addition to the 18-day annual exercise, the public must also practice rifle target shooting, 30 rounds per year. If they fail, they must continue to receive training. Shooting in Switzerland is known as a national skill. Every village has a shooting range for men to practice, and competitions are often held, which has become one of the important events in Swiss social life. Since the Swiss people are skilled in shooting and the army is purely defensive, the term of service for the people in the military can be reduced to the minimum. Since the 16th century, Switzerland has never tried to expand its territory, and its only purpose is to maintain freedom."

Historical Anecdotes

### The Three Virtues of Shrimp

— Zhu Yu

——One of Aizi's New Interpretations

Tonight, Aizi drank a few more glasses of wine and fell asleep in a daze. He vaguely began to dream.

A great man walked towards him and introduced himself: "I am the Dragon King of the East Sea. I have come to visit you because I admire your talent."

"You are too kind," Aizi said after bowing. "What can I do for you?"

"I want to find a son-in-law..."

"This is something ordinary people cannot do..." Aizi interrupted.

"No, no!" The Dragon King hurriedly defended: "We don't intermarry with ordinary people. What I mean is, I can't find a suitable aquatic creature to be my son-in-law. Please give me some advice."

"Oh!" Aizi calmed down and continued. "First, what are the conditions?"

"He will be my son-in-law without any conditions. I will give him pearls, corals, and countless other treasures from the sea. In addition, I will give him a fief and make him my vassal, so that he can enjoy happiness."

"Then what is your Majesty's temper like?" Aizi asked again.

"This is the crux of the problem. I have a very bad temper, and so does my daughter, so I don't want to recruit a dragon as my son-in-law, lest everyone act impulsively."

"Your Majesty is probably also suspicious?"

"Mr. Ai is really speaking my mind," the Dragon King said with a smile.

"In this case," Aizi rubbed his palms and said, "In the eyes of ordinary people, only the shrimp is qualified to enter the inner circle."

"The shrimp is qualified to be selected?" The Dragon King was extremely suspicious.

"Please don't underestimate the shrimp, he has three virtues: First, he has no heart or lungs, showing no differences; second, he has no blood, which the king can punish at will; third, his head is covered in mud, so he can be humble, and even if you ask him to burrow into manure to become a speculator, it doesn't matter."

"Good, good!" The Dragon King left satisfied.

Aizi's dream was over, and my "new interpretation" was also over, but the shrimp was still dreaming an endless dream.

### The Power to Unfold

— Translated by Ye Meizhen

Here's another example: Lincoln's stepmother was just a housewife. Busy with daily chores all day long. But she taught and inspired her husband's son. As a result, Lincoln freed the slaves by the torch given by her. Lincoln once wrote in a letter: "You ask me what is the greatest book I have ever redeemed? I tell you, it is my stepmother!" She was just a housewife. But she was able to instill the love of God and the world into her husband's heart. So became the greatest evangelist of the time.

We do not believe that the great cause of the world must be created by one person alone. But Emerson said, "A great cause is just the shadow of one person unfolding." He also said, "There is no great or small. Others are greater than me because they have ignited the divine spark; and I have not. We have accomplished nothing because we despise ourselves and have not recognized the power of our position." Jesus said, "If you can have a mustard seed of faith, then you will accomplish everything!"

We firmly believe a simple fact; that is, life must have a purpose. The seeds of divine power are to be cultivated and released by us. The method is obvious. Our duty is to work tirelessly. A young man without faith will say, "I am worthless." But a young man with correct ideas will say, "I am priceless!" And try to prove it.

Napoleon has a wise saying: "Environment? I can create the environment." This is not something only an arrogant person would say. This is a fact. We can each create the environment!

### Present

— Ma Lan

Life is a point of view that turns red and green, or happy or sad, through the eyes of your prejudice. So the wise say that each person creates their own life. This is quite reasonable.

You can make your life valuable and meaningful. So no one only dwells on the past, saying that the past years were better than today. You live in the present moment, and what you have to grasp is only the present moment, but you can, and must, strive for the future moment. The past is just an unavoidable existence, and the loss of the present moment can predict that a new force will flow from the future to the past.

Traffic

### Roadside Horrors

— Liu Lan

Traffic accidents occur frequently on American highways, and countless people are unjustly killed by cars every year. As a result, experts are thinking about an effective roadside marker to warn drivers to slow down. One expert said that the symbol of death is the most powerful. So he suggested using a skull and waist as a roadside marker to warn careless drivers. It is said that this suggestion may be adopted during the "Safety Movement" season.

### Sharing the Same Boat Through Storms

— He Jia Zhi

(4) In the lingering glow of the setting sun

Guofang said, "Let's go over there and see what's planted in the field?" Cuizhen walked in front, smiling, "I know more about this than you do. What's growing in the field with green leaves is wheat. After a rain at the end of last year, the leaves grew quickly. Some fields have not planted anything yet, preparing to sow cotton seeds after Qingming. If water has been drained into the field, then rice seeds must be sown. Miss Guofang, if you come to us in April, it will be very lively: the rice seedlings emerging from the water; the cotton stalks in the cotton fields; are so tall. Broad bean flowers, rapeseed flowers, purple, yellow, frogs croaking in the water, on the river beach: swallows flying around, as busy as farmers; that's really lively." Guofang said, "I know, that's the busy farming season. Every summer vacation, my siblings and I return to my grandmother's place. Although we live in town, we can often see the scenery of the countryside. Sister Cuizhen, how about you and Brother Weicheng come to Shuangqiao together during the summer vacation?" Cuizhen agreed and said, "I'm afraid Aunt Ye's cousin is gone, I will be busy, maybe I can't come."

The two walked along the way, even if they did not forget how far they had traveled, they felt that walking like this was a pleasure. Guofang, after all, was not much different from "unable to distinguish beans from wheat", pointed to the grass by the field, treated it as wheat, and said, "This wheat is indeed very easy to propagate, growing on the bank of the field." Cuizhen leaned down to pick grass leaves and wheat leaves, compared them for Guofang to see, and said that this was grass, and this was wheat. Guofang smiled, "People from the countryside are laughed at by people in Shanghai; but people from Shanghai in the countryside are also laughed at by people in the countryside. Sister Cuizhen, you are so good, you not only didn't laugh at me, but also patiently guided me. If you were my sister, or my cousin, I wouldn't let you marry, I would keep you at home, and talk and laugh with me, how good would that be. Sister Cuizhen, don't you think what I said is what a child would say?" Guofang, while speaking, only put her face on Cuizhen's arm. But Cuizhen stood by the bank of the field and smiled, "No one will want me." This sentence was nothing more than telling Guofang that she was not engaged to anyone. (63)
