### Japanese Imperial Headquarters Announces Second Pacific War Results: Eight American Ships Sunk

Tokyo, 16th (Domei News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced today at 3:30 PM the second set of war results for the naval and air battles in the Pacific on the 26th of last month, stating that three American aircraft carriers, one battleship, three cruisers, and one destroyer were sunk in the battle. Three unidentified warships and three destroyers were severely damaged. Over 200 aircraft were destroyed. The details are as follows: Sunk were one battleship, the aircraft carriers "Enterprise" and "Hornet," and one other large aircraft carrier, three cruisers, and one destroyer. Severely damaged were three unidentified warships and three destroyers. Regarding enemy aircraft destroyed: Over 55 were shot down in combat over enemy territory, and 25 were shot down in combat over Japanese military positions and by anti-aircraft fire from warships. Including those that sank with the aircraft carriers, the total is over 200. Note: The "Hornet" type American aircraft carrier previously reported sunk in the Midway Island battle was the "Yorktown," and the "Enterprise" type aircraft carrier was also severely damaged in that battle. Also, the "Yorktown" type aircraft carrier previously reported sunk in the Coral Sea battle was a specially built aircraft carrier.

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a dispatch from a Japanese aircraft carrier's accompanying reporter, the two fleets engaged in a major naval battle in the South Pacific to determine supremacy. Aerial combat broke out simultaneously, resulting in heavy damage to the enemy fleet. The following is the reporter's eyewitness account of the naval battle from a certain aircraft carrier. To recover from the disastrous defeats since the first Solomon Sea battle, the enemy formed a ring formation centered around a group of aircraft carriers, with multiple battleships, cruisers, and destroyers. On the 22nd of last month, at a certain hour in the morning, they appeared on the sea north of the Santa Cruz Islands. Our reconnaissance aircraft took off from the mother ship to search for the enemy fleet. At a certain hour in the morning, the ship's loudspeaker suddenly announced, "Two enemy planes spotted!" Soon, the reconnaissance plane reported, "Enemy aircraft carriers discovered at a certain location." Our elite fighter squadron immediately took off from the deck, forming a formation. Shortly after, dive bombers and attack plane squadrons also took off, and a battle to annihilate the enemy began. Instantly, the commander sent a telegram from his plane stating that the entire force was commencing the attack. At this time, our planes circled above our aircraft carrier to defend against enemy attacks. Later, a fighter plane reported that a large number of enemy planes were approaching. Our fighters immediately engaged the enemy, and our fleet began firing into the sky, initiating a fierce battle. Enemy planes dropped bombs around our aircraft carrier and disappeared. Only smoke filled the air. After our fighters ascended, they saw a squadron of enemy bombers flying in formation, intending to attack our ship. Seeing the dangerous situation of our aircraft carrier, our fighters charged toward the enemy command plane. The enemy's second command plane was shot down by our anti-aircraft fire, and the air battle concluded. During this battle, the aircraft carrier I was on was hit by one enemy bomb, and black smoke billowed from the rear deck, but it continued to move at maximum speed, without any reduction in speed. The fire was soon extinguished. At that time, the ship's loudspeaker announced that our attack planes had sunk two enemy aircraft carriers. It then reported that one enemy aircraft carrier was heavily damaged and on fire. The naval air squadron, which had established distinguished service, had safely returned. Later, a reconnaissance plane reported that there were no enemy planes in the sky above the enemy fleet. A moment ago, our naval planes, which had just landed, took off again with bombs. Soon, the loudspeaker announced that they had sunk one battleship, one large warship of an unknown type, and several enemy cruisers and destroyers. It continued, stating that one enemy aircraft carrier was drifting. Before long, night fell, and our aircraft carrier ceased operations. The naval surface force carried out a night attack. It was confirmed that in this battle, our side sank one enemy aircraft carrier, three cruisers, one destroyer, heavily damaged three ships of unknown type, lightly damaged three destroyers, and shot down over 200 enemy planes, achieving a tremendous victory.

### Chairman Wang Inspects Security Forces in Wuchang and Delivers a Speech

Hankou, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - This morning at 9:00 AM, Chairman Wang, accompanied by Minister of Propaganda Lin, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan Chen Chunpu, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhou Longxiang, and Supreme Military Advisor Matsui, crossed the Yangtze River from the Jianghan Guan pier in Hankou to Wuchang. Governor Yang also accompanied them. Consuls from friendly nations, Germany and Italy, also attended as guests. At 9:30 AM, the Chairman's special vessel arrived at the shore. Tens of thousands of students and civilians welcomed them along the route. At 9:40 AM, they proceeded to Baobing Hall. Soldiers of the Second Brigade of the 29th Division Security Command stood at attention in the square. The Chairman, in his capacity as Chairman of the Military Commission, began the inspection. Chief of Staff Zhang of the Security Command led the inspection. Over 2,000 soldiers marched around the reviewing stand. They then gathered in front of the reviewing stand to listen respectfully to the Chairman's address. After a short break, they proceeded to the provincial government to take an oath.

Hankou, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Yesterday, the 15th, at 2:00 PM, the Chairman, accompanied by Minister Lin, Secretary-General Chen, and accompanying personnel, as well as Chief of Staff Yagi and Special Affairs Minister Ochiai from friendly nations, and escorted by Governor Yang and Director of Education He, traveled by car to the Hubei Provincial Normal School in Wuchang to inspect the Kenian Corps and Boy Scouts. The motorcade arrived in front of the Provincial Normal School. Amidst the uplifting sounds of military music, the Chairman alighted from the car and entered the sports field of the Provincial Normal School to await the lining up of the various school formations. He ascended the reviewing stand and began the inspection. A total of 27 units from various schools, including normal schools, primary schools, and secondary schools, with 2,000 students, first marched around the field. As they passed the reviewing stand, the leading personnel shouted the slogan "Attention! Eyes Right!" The Chairman frequently raised his hand in response. A march-past and a mass drill then followed. After the drill, the Chairman delivered a brief address. At 3:10 PM, the inspection ceremony concluded. The Chairman and accompanying personnel then boarded the Provincial Government's special vessel "Hua An" at 3:25 PM and crossed the river back to Hankou.

Hankou, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Governor Yang of the Provincial Government and the commissioners and directors, after receiving clear instructions from the Central Government, recognizing the complexity of Hubei's administrative affairs requiring immediate attention, have begun their duties. It has been decided to hold a swearing-in ceremony this morning in the main hall of the Provincial Government and to simultaneously celebrate the third anniversary of the establishment of the Provincial Government.

Hankou, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Fifteen thousand members of the Hankou City Police Force, students from various primary and secondary schools, and members of the Youth Corps and Boy Scouts held a grand inspection ceremony at Zhongshan Park at 2:00 PM today. Chairman Wang was invited to preside over the inspection. After the inspection, the Chairman visited the Municipal Government to listen to Mayor Zhang's report on the municipal situation and gave earnest instructions to all staff members. In the evening at 7:00 PM, the Japanese Naval Authorities hosted a special banquet.

Hankou, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Chairman Wang delivered instructions to high-ranking officials and comrades of the Wuhan Garrison Headquarters, the Provincial Government, and the Provincial Party Headquarters at 11:30 AM on the 15th. A summary is as follows: (1) Regarding the establishment of the Garrison Headquarters, he pointed out the importance of unifying military and political affairs. He expressed his admiration and gratitude for the assistance of friendly nations and the efforts of armed comrades. He then pointed out the key points of building the army: the implementation of a policy of elite troops. Since the Incident, there has been fragmentation and destruction. Rebuilding the army is extremely difficult. Currently, the main tasks are: (a) to consolidate fragmented forces into a whole, and (b) to intensify training. The training work must first establish a firm belief in spiritual education. In the Greater East Asia War, China and Japan are in a position of shared security and have a shared responsibility for life and death. Today, we must not only be good neighbors and friends but also share joys and sorrows. Secondly, there must be a spirit of introspection, constantly seeking progress in technology and material improvement. Many people often make two mistakes: they either only want to increase the number of troops, or they complain about the lack of material equipment. They do not realize that the lack of material equipment requires even more vigorous spirit to transform material strength with spirit. At this time, first, we must humbly accept the assistance of friendly nations, and second, we must strive for our own progress. The so-called humility and self-respect are most important. We must know that friendly nations expect us to be friends with them, powerful friends, not useless friends. Without self-respect and without effort, being merely passive and reactive, we are not worthy of being called friends. If we want to cooperate in the Greater East Asia War, without strength, how can we talk about cooperation? If we do not share the hardships with friendly nations, how can we talk about sharing the joys? (2) It is the responsibility of armed comrades, and also the responsibility of those in the Provincial Government, to improve the people's livelihood by ensuring security. Improving the people's livelihood is a key task of administration, but without guaranteed security and transportation, there is no way to improve the people's livelihood. China today, during the Greater East Asia War, has not yet achieved full peace. Compatriots across the country live under the ravages of scorched-earth warfare and guerrilla warfare. Productivity is being destroyed daily. China has always lacked food, and now the shortage is even more acute. If we do not quickly protect security, the remaining productivity will only decline rapidly. Today, ensuring security and improving the people's livelihood are undoubtedly arduous tasks. But precisely because they are arduous and difficult, we need to intensify our efforts and shoulder our responsibilities. Taking the work of "clearing the countryside" as an example, after clearing the countryside in the Jiangsu area, security was gradually established, and remnants of bandits were gradually eliminated. By reorganizing taxation, revenue increased 35 times. It can be seen that even in hardship and difficulty, as long as we make efforts little by little, there will definitely be progress, results, and a bright future. (3) Finally, he gave earnest instructions to the comrades of the Provincial Party Headquarters. Although the duties of comrades in the Party Headquarters are different from those serving in the military and political fields, the responsibilities are the same. We must shoulder the dual task of revitalizing China and protecting East Asia. We must always think about the future of East Asia, the situation of the country, and the suffering of the people. We must become more tense and more excited in suffering. In other words, we must save ourselves from death. Comrades in the Party Headquarters do not lead troops or hold official positions, but the position of each of you is as important as the position of military and political personnel. What position is that? It is the position of the common people. Your eyes must see the suffering of the common people, your minds must think about the suffering of the common people, and your bodies must endure the same suffering as the common people. Standing in the position of the common people, lead the common people to push the common people to relieve their suffering. Not to relieve the suffering of individuals, but to relieve the suffering of the nation and the people, to relieve the suffering of all compatriots, to relieve the suffering of the entire East Asia. All comrades must have the spirit of enduring suffering. Standing in the position of the common people, endure your own suffering to relieve the suffering of the nation and the people. Only by not being困 forced or overwhelmed by suffering, the more suffering, the more nervous, the more effort, can we be able to shoulder the responsibility of leading the masses to revitalize China and protect East Asia. (4) Today, the military, political, and party personnel are united together. Some of the military and political personnel are not members of the Kuomintang, but my words are exactly the same, and my expectations are exactly the same. Ever since the National Government returned to the capital, it has been centered on the Kuomintang, uniting all parties and factions to overcome difficulties together. Former Chairman He at that time participated in the Central Political Conference, and later resolutely dissolved the Republican Party and joined the Kuomintang, simply to concentrate strength and strengthen the central forces. It must be known that at this critical juncture of life and death for the nation, there is only one doctrine and only one way to save China and protect East Asia. There is no second way. Finally, the Chairman encouraged the military, political, and party workers with the essentials of the New National Movement, to work together with one heart and one mind to achieve the great mission of ensuring security, improving the people's livelihood, revitalizing China, and protecting East Asia.

Hankou, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The main points of Chairman Wang's address during the troop review in Wuchang yesterday (the 15th) were as follows: (1) The first requirement for building an army is military order, unifying military minds and solidarity. The establishment of the Wuhan Garrison Headquarters, engaged in the reorganization of the army and the establishment of security forces, has its main task in this. (2) The greatest task of the military now is to think big and start small. The so-called "think big" means to recognize the mission of the times, to love China, to love Japan, and to love East Asia, and to unite these three aspirations into one. Since the return of the National Government to the capital, the fundamental belief of the peace movement has been in this. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, this belief has been further strengthened. It is not only to be friends with Japan, but also to be friends with friendly nations, sharing joys and sorrows. In terms of the war situation, friendly nations are at the front, and we are at the rear. We must strive to consolidate the rear so that friendly nations have no worries about the rear. This is our current effort to cooperate in the Greater East Asia War. The so-called "start small" means that Hubei is located in the center of national transportation and is also at the front line. Establishing security is a very important and great responsibility. Only by establishing security can the people live and work in peace. If the army treats the people as its heart, then the people will naturally treat the army as their limbs. This is how military and popular sentiment can be united. The two things mentioned above are actually one thing, because only by defending East Asia can we defend the country, and only by defending the country can we defend our homeland. Conversely, only by defending our homeland can we defend the country, and only by defending the country can we defend East Asia. (3) The establishment of the Garrison Headquarters, the reorganization of the army, and the establishment of security forces are all in their initial stages. The heavy labor of everyone is constantly in my mind. Only by being diligent, brave, and intensifying training can we become elite and brave soldiers. I share joys and sorrows, life and death, with all my comrades, to complete the great mission of revitalizing China and defending East Asia.

Hankou, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The main points of Chairman Wang's address during the inspection of students and Boy Scouts in Wuchang yesterday (the 15th) were: (1) First, he expressed his satisfaction with the students and Boy Scouts' spirited demeanor and well-organized training. (2) Next, he pointed out the trend of the times, stating that today we only have two paths: to be comrades of East Asia or to be traitors of East Asia. To save China, we must share joys and sorrows with friendly nations. (3) Revitalizing China and protecting East Asia is an arduous task. To shoulder this task, first, we must know the current situation of the country, and second, we must know our own shortcomings. (4) Next, the Chairman gave special instructions on the key points to pay attention to in promoting the New National Movement, the purpose of the organization and training of the Youth Corps and Boy Scouts. (5) The so-called "organization" is not to establish power for individuals or a certain faction or system, but to cultivate strength for the country. (6) The so-called "training" is not just putting up slogans and shouting slogans. We must do it practically. Everything we say in our hearts must be made a reality. (7) Finally, the Chairman said, "During the parade just now, I saw that some of the students didn't even have jackets to wear, and I felt really sad, just like my own children didn't have jackets to wear. Today, we really don't know how many teenagers, how many children, are still suffering even more. Thinking of this, we can only work harder, endure hardship, and be more courageous and diligent on the road to revitalizing China and protecting East Asia, to relieve the suffering of our compatriots, to save the country from danger, and to win victory for East Asia."

### Pétain Issues Statement Denouncing Darlan; Anti-Axis Government Established in Morocco; Darlan as Chairman, Giraud as Commander-in-Chief

Vichy, 16th (Havas dispatch) - The Information Department issued a communique today stating that the radio station in Morocco had broadcast a proclamation by Admiral Darlan, the content of which was tantamount to announcing a rebellion. Upon learning of this, Marshal Pétain issued a statement to the French people at home and in the colonies, which stated: "Admiral Darlan claimed in his proclamation that he had unspeakable secrets for the French people and that he was acting on my behalf. However, I am not a person who can be coerced, and to say so is an insult to me. When Africa was attacked, I, as the guardian of French sovereignty, entrusted the task of defending French sovereignty to Admiral Darlan. At the initial contact, Admiral Darlan resolutely ordered a counterattack, but almost immediately reversed himself and quickly ordered a ceasefire, causing military morale to collapse and making resistance impossible. I have repeatedly ordered him to protect Africa, but he ignored this in the name of preventing General Giraud from stealing military power. I have therefore dismissed him from his post today and stripped him of all his public and military duties. General Giraud is the one who, instigated by foreign powers, has caused the flames of war to spread to French territory. His crime is even more unforgivable."

Vichy, 15th (Havas dispatch) - Marshal Pétain, in his capacity as Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, has issued a statement to the French armed forces, stating in part: "General Giraud has broken faith. Today, he falsely claims that I have given him the position of Commander-in-Chief of the French forces in Africa. In fact, this title was given by a certain country. I absolutely forbid General Giraud from usurping my name and representing himself as my representative. Do not support this rebellious act. You must refuse to obey his orders. I am your commander, now and in the future." At the same time, the Information Department also issued a communique stating: "General Giraud has issued a radio address, the wording of which is designed to call on people to join the separatist forces. A few days ago, General Giraud delivered a speech on the Algiers radio station, the remarks of which shocked the French government, as he had expressed his loyalty to Marshal Pétain just a week before. Today, General Giraud has shown himself as a rebel. The French government must emphasize that Marshal Pétain has issued orders to the French forces in North Africa to resist. Only these orders are worthy of obedience." In addition, Prime Minister Laval met with Marshal Pétain this morning, and in the afternoon he held talks with several cabinet members. The topics discussed in each meeting were: (1) the recent events in North Africa, (2) the new situation in France caused by the events in North Africa, and (3) the steps to be taken to deal with new difficulties.

Lisbon, 15th (Domei News Agency dispatch) - According to Moroccan broadcasts, General Eisenhower, Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces, established a French anti-Axis government in Morocco on the 15th, with former Commander-in-Chief of the French Army, Navy, and Air Force Darlan as Chairman, and General Giraud appointed as Commander-in-Chief of the anti-Axis French forces. Observers here believe that the new government is a puppet government created by the United States and Britain, like Tegorpa, with no real power. They are merely props for the Allied Nations' propaganda.

### Northeast of Tuapse Port: Fierce Battle Between Germany and the Soviet Union; Both Sides Vie for the Goitkh Mountain Pass; German Offensive Stalled at the City of Tuapse

Berlin, 16th (Haitong News Agency): The Eastern Front was particularly quiet yesterday. Only in the Stalingrad and Caucasus regions did Soviet troops attempt to advance. German troops destroyed several enemy bunkers and captured several enemy soldiers. The German Air Force was active along the entire front, and eight Soviet aircraft were shot down in aerial combat, with no German losses.

Moscow, 15th (Havas News Agency): This radio station has just broadcast the following war news: In the past twenty-four hours, our forces have engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy in the city of Stalingrad and northeast of Tuapse Port, southeast of Nalchik. There were no changes on other fronts.

Somewhere on the German Border, 15th (Havas News Agency): Although the weather has been poor in recent days, fierce fighting continues on the Volga and Caucasus fronts. The fighting has been particularly intense in the three major battle zones in the past two days. (1) In the Stalingrad area, both enemy forces are extremely active. As a result of the tug-of-war, neither side can advance more than two hundred yards beyond the enemy's lines. The fighting is still ongoing, but only small units are engaged. Heavy artillery is being used to intensify the bombardment. It is believed that the German-Romanian allied forces have switched to heavy artillery tactics in recent days in order to reduce the number of soldier casualties. Red Army strongholds and bunkers are constantly bombarded by German artillery. To the north of Stalingrad, the Red Army is pressing towards the Axis forces, but in the last forty-eight hours, the Red Army has made no progress. According to Soviet sources, the fighting in the area was launched by the Red Army on the 13th of this month, but yesterday there was only reconnaissance activity, seemingly aimed at exploring weaknesses in the German defensive lines. (2) The situation on the Caucasus front at Alagir remains quite chaotic. However, according to neutral military observers, there has been fierce fighting in the Terek River bend area in the last twenty-four hours. A large number of German-Romanian allied forces along the railway line from Vladikavkaz to Prokhladnyy to Grozny have been ordered to break through the Red Army lines west of Grozny. The Red Army in the area fought with all their might for several hours, but as of today, the Axis forces have gained the upper hand. (3) In the Tuapse area, fierce fighting has occurred in the past twenty-four hours as both sides vie for the Goitkh Mountain Pass. The fighting is centered on a hill controlling the mountain pass. For thirty-six hours, this hill has been constantly subjected to bombardment and attacks by both sides. Neutral observers believe that the hill is the last Red Army stronghold in Tuapse, but the capture of this hill does not mean that Tuapse will immediately fall. At that time, the German army will still have to bring heavy artillery to destroy the city's defensive works.

Stockholm, 16th (Havas): The German-Soviet war has entered its seventy-fourth week. German forces are intensifying their attacks on three major targets, seemingly aiming to completely clear Stalingrad of enemy troops before winter and to occupy Ordzhonikidze and Tuapse. The situation in each area is as follows: (1) In the Stalingrad area, fighting has intensified in the past four or five days, but has not reached the scale of the major offensives in September and October of this year. The German army does not need to occupy the fortified factories, only to break through the ground filled with air-raid shelters, where many Red Army soldiers are currently hiding and stubbornly resisting. Recent German attacks seem to have been thwarted by the Red Army, but the Red Army has failed to mend the breaches opened in its lines. Yesterday, fierce fighting occurred about three hundred yards south of the "October Revolution Factory." The Red Army claims to have launched several counter-attacks, but it is unknown whether these counter-attacks were successful. (2) Moscow Radio announced last night that since the 14th of this month, the Red Army has launched a large-scale offensive in the Nalchik area and recaptured a large amount of territory. German war reports have not confirmed this, but they say that there have been fierce attacks in the central Caucasus, and that German forces have captured 20,000 Red Army soldiers and 1,000 field guns in the Terek River area (including Nalchik). This is the highest figure announced by the German side since the encirclement battle in the Kalach area in early August of this year. Many believe that a similar encirclement battle may occur between the Terek River bend, Nalchik, Alagir, and Elkhotovo. (3) Northeast of the Port of Tuapse, the Red Army appears to have held its ground, preventing German forces from crossing the Goitkh Mountain Pass and reaching the Black Sea coast. German forces have been blocked at the mountain pass for twenty-five days. (4) In the Don River bend area, German forces have been attempting to reach the left bank of the Don River for several weeks, with the support of Romanian and Hungarian troops. Red Army reserves are reported to have been sent to the area as reinforcements. The German Air Force is constantly bombing the area. (5) On the northern front, the Red Army is conducting local attacks south of Lake Ilmen. The central front is quiet, as the roads are not yet solid enough to allow mechanized units to launch rapid and large-scale attacks.

### Situation in India Remains Extremely Chaotic; Strikes Continue in Various Locations

Bangkok, 16th (Haitong News Agency): According to information from New Delhi, the situation in India remains extremely chaotic. Hundreds of Indian nationalists are arrested every day. Most schools have not opened. Workers in Ahmedabad, although in a state of starvation, continue to strike. Direct rail service between Calcutta and Mumbai has been disrupted due to acts of sabotage. Trains have been derailed in various locations. Peasants in Bihar and Madras provinces have rioted. Since the imprisonment of most Congress Party leaders, pro-Axis elements have become increasingly powerful. Most Indians believe that whether Britain adopts an offensive or defensive posture in Asia, the unrest in India will not be easily suppressed. The Kaniapaisa post office in Bengal province was set on fire by Indians. Students at Lucknow University are on strike. Crowds have demonstrated in the city's streets, leading to numerous arrests. An administrative office has also been set on fire.

Bangkok, 16th (Haitong News Agency): According to reports from Chongqing, an American journalist, after inspecting India for a month, recently arrived in Kunming. He believes that (1) Indian people cannot trust Britain's promise to allow India to gain freedom after the war; (2) Indian people hate British rule; (3) Indian people believe that internal difficulties can be resolved. Although the United States has guaranteed India complete independence and the establishment of a national government with real power, Indian people do not believe that India will serve the Allied powers because of this promise. The state of unrest in India is due to economic oppression, the requisition of property for military reasons without compensation, and the failure to limit the increase in the cost of living. Indian people believe that only a clear guarantee and the transfer of real power can solve the Indian problem. Although Cripps considered having Indians serve as ministers, he did not transfer real power. The Governor-General of India will continue to exercise his veto power, and the Executive Council also lacks a basis for overall responsibility. Indian people believe that Britain overemphasizes India's internal difficulties in order to refuse to transfer real power. Indian leaders all believe that if Gandhi and Nehru were released, and Britain allowed the organization of an Indian government with real power, then Hindus and Muslims could easily reach an understanding within twenty-four hours.

### Special Allocation of Sugar for Pharmaceutical Factories, Pharmacies, and Restaurants; Limited to Uses Relevant to Society

The Shanghai Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office sells sugar, which was originally divided into types A and B. Because the supply needed for dispensing in restaurants, food stores, pharmaceutical factories, and pharmacies is insufficient, special permission is granted to handle it in accordance with special allocation regulations after careful consideration. However, it must be applied for and verified before approval can be granted. The public is not very clear about the procedures for applying for special allocations. Yesterday, the reporter from the Central News Agency visited the Business Office. According to the person in charge, the amount of sugar allocated under this special application is very small and is limited to pharmaceutical factories and pharmacies for dispensing, as well as restaurants, that have a significant relationship with society. Manufacturers in the aforementioned industries must accurately fill out the required quantities and submit a letter of application to the Business Office. After the Business Office sends personnel to conduct a thorough investigation and confirm the facts, it will allocate sugar as appropriate. This is to prevent unscrupulous individuals from falsely reporting stockpiles or reselling for profit in disguise, which would violate the principles of allocation and affect the entire issue of public food supply. Therefore, this special allocation is handled with extreme caution.

Registration Revoked for Two Stores Violating Regulations

The Type A retail sugar merchants of the Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office, No. 47 Shishi Kan Store and No. 224 Yuchangtai South Goods Store, violated the regulations by selling sugar at the door. A complaint was filed with the French authorities. The French police sent personnel to conduct a thorough investigation and confirmed the facts. The Business Office was notified by letter to revoke the registration in accordance with the law and not to show favoritism. After receiving the letter, the Business Office immediately complied with the regulations and permanently revoked the registration of the two retail stores. It also allocated the sugar they had in stock to other retail stores for sale and announced it in the market as a warning to others.

### Shanghai Starts Issuing Bread Coupons Yesterday

Bread coupons for December and January of next year for residents of the two concessions and western Shanghai began to be issued yesterday (the 16th) and are scheduled to end on the 27th of this month (Friday).

More Than 20,000 Chinese Food Households

There are more than 20,000 Chinese and foreign residents registered for bread coupons, and there are also several thousand Japanese households. The evidence for obtaining the coupons is an identity card for foreigners and a citizen card for Chinese.

Must Specify the Name of the Bread Maker

For the issuance of bread coupons to residents of the French Concession, according to experience, most residents who receive bread coupons do not know the name of the bread maker they registered with. Because the name of the bread maker is essential when filling out the new coupon, residents are requested to specify it when receiving the coupon to avoid delays in issuance.

### Planned Distribution of Oil Sales by Area Based on Population; If 20,000 Piculs Are Allocated, Oil Will Be Sold for Twenty Days a Month

The Shanghai Edible Oil Industry Wholesalers Association has submitted a request to the authorities for approval to allocate one thousand tons of edible oil. Five hundred tons (i.e., 10,000 piculs) have been available since the 14th for registered edible oil retailers to pay for and receive the oil. From 9:00 AM yesterday (the 16th), more than 130 retail stores throughout the city universally sold edible oil. Each person was limited to half a catty, and the price was sold in accordance with regulations. Crowds of edible oil users made purchases. Each retail store posted the amount of edible oil sold each day for public information to prevent retail stores from deducting the amount of oil sold. Yesterday, a Central News Agency reporter learned from the Wholesalers Association that the second batch of five hundred tons of edible oil is also in the process of obtaining a transport permit and is expected to continue to be shipped and allocated in late this month. However, in order to prevent abuses, the Edible Oil Industry Association specially announced yesterday that 1,000 piculs will be sold daily from now on. If the authorities can supply 30,000 piculs of edible oil per month, then the need for edible oil can be met. If only 20,000 piculs are allocated as before, oil will only be sold for twenty days a month. But according to past experience, the supply of edible oil is not expected to be scarce. It is now known that in order to further meet the need for edible oil, the amount of edible oil will be distributed in the future according to the population of each area in order to achieve a balanced supply.

### Associations and Sections Contact Various Industries to Maintain Fair Distribution of Materials; Price Controls Start with Manufacturers; Registration of Sub-Associations Ends at the End of This Month

Since its establishment, the Associations Section of the Materials Control Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council has been progressing smoothly. The motive for establishing the section is to contact various industry associations in the city to jointly control prices and distribute materials. Currently, half of the city's associations have registered with the Shanghai Municipal Council, and the rest are limited to completing the registration procedures by the end of this month. Once the registration is completed, in addition to making every effort to communicate the relationship between the authorities and various industries, the Associations Section will accept good-faith applications from various industry associations and review them, and further guide the activities of various industries, so that both the government and businesses can seek solutions to problems. In the past, various industries always adopted an incredulous attitude towards any price restriction measures adopted by the authorities. Now, the establishment of the Associations Section is aimed at breaking the traditional prejudices of various industries and gaining their trust and understanding. In addition to clarifying the internal situation of various industries through registration procedures, it will assist various associations in forming a systematic organization, ordering stores to join related associations, and making the associations into control agencies that can truly represent various industries. In terms of price controls, the Associations Section will seek a reasonable price level under the principle of taking into account both commerce and people's livelihoods. In terms of methods, it will start with the manufacturers, then go to the wholesalers, and then go to the retail sales. In other words, at the time of manufacturing the goods, the cost price will be adjusted, and the retail price will be controlled gradually through wholesale. The Associations Section should also maintain contact with various relevant authorities under the conditions permitted by the environment, dredge the source of goods, maintain the supply of materials, and ensure fair distribution.

### Wang Peiyuan Passes Away; Various Circles Mourn

Mr. Wang Peiyuan, the founder of the Chinese Red Cross Society and a medical doctor, (father of Yaoting, Yaotang, and Yaoguo), devoted his life to charitable causes, sparing no effort to benefit society and the people. It is truly regrettable that Heaven did not grant him more years, and he suddenly passed away. Yuan Lüden, Wen Lantian, Lin Kanghou, Huang Jinrong, and others have long-standing friendships with him. In order to commemorate his life's work, they held a memorial service at the Ningbo Fellow Association at 2:00 PM on the 15th of this month. About a thousand celebrities and friends from all walks of life attended the service. The Pingjiang Children's Home, the Chinese Women and Children Relief Association, and the Refugee Children's Home each sent a full orchestra to attend the service and express their condolences. The ceremony was solemn and grand. His family decided to continue the deceased's purpose of engaging in charitable causes and donate all the more than 20,000 yuan received in condolence money to various charitable organizations.

### The Hua Liying Case; Juvenile Offender Interrogated

Hua Liying, a Suzhou woman and a popular dancer at the MGM Ballroom, was murdered for money by thugs after finishing dancing on the night of the 12th, when she returned to her residence at No. 74 Hengmao Lane, Baxianqiao. All her jewelry, including diamond rings, gold bracelets, gold lockets, gold rings, and watches, were robbed. After the case occurred, the French police immediately obtained clues about the stolen goods based on a report from a silver shop and arrested the main culprit, Zhang Hongsheng (23 years old), a young man from Ningbo from a wealthy family, and Jiang Yilong (15 years old), a young student from Suzhou, at the Cangzhou Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road. They were taken back to the police station, where they confessed to the robbery and murder without denying it. Hua Liying's body was coffined and enshrouded by her dancer friend Zhou Peide. The details of all these matters have been recorded in previous reports. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the police sent the two criminals, Zhang and Jiang, to the court, where the representative lawyer claimed that the defendants in this case were accused of robbery and murder. The police requested a postponement and that the defendants be kept in custody because the investigation procedures had not been completed. After the court verified the report, it briefly interrogated the defendants and instructed that the trial be postponed to 9:00 AM on the 30th of this month. The two defendants were detained.

### Bond Market Inevitably Complies

Since the public debt market suddenly hit the limit up on the 9th, it failed to open the next day, which this newspaper believes is not a blessing for the market. Unfortunately, this prediction came true. During this week, there was initially very little trading outside the market, and after a day or two, people were groping in the dark. Yesterday, trading outside the market was more active, and the market was weak, but it also fluctuated at times, and people's hearts were not dead. Last week, the exchange announced that all transactions must be calculated at a 10% discount, and the maximum price was limited to 50 yuan before entering the market. This was announced to all brokers to show that it was imperative, but trading outside the market was still being done at 55 yuan, which can be said to be blindly ignorant of the situation. Yesterday, Class C bonds initially traded at 55.6 yuan, but were pushed up to 6.7 yuan due to enthusiastic buying. After entering, buying surged again, and then plunged to 4.7 yuan. Class A bonds traded at over 5 yuan, and after entering, were at 3.3 yuan. Class B bonds traded at a high of 3.8 yuan, and after entering, were only at 1.8 yuan. Class D bonds reached a high of 1.5 yuan, and after entering, were at 49.9 yuan. Class E bonds had a high price of 3 yuan and a low price of 0.8 yuan. Compared to the prices on the 9th, the prices were already much lower, but they were still much higher than the price limit. Although yesterday's market prices fell from high to low, there was still not much difference compared to last Saturday, and the trend was one of a complete collapse. It is predicted that in the future, it will inevitably succumb to the range, and the various parties should also know where to return. The transaction volume was about 2 million yuan.

### Jewelry and Silver Exchange Rate Remains Unchanged

Yesterday, the jewellers of this city, the Daxin Guild, listed the price of gold jewellery at 2,650 yuan per tael (with a deduction of about 300 yuan for purchases), unchanged. The inter-dealer price has risen to outside the 2,400 yuan mark, and the market is very good. In the morning, it was 2,420 yuan, up 30 yuan, and once briefly fell back to 2,410 yuan, but immediately rose again, trading over 2,430 yuan. At noon, it was 2,420 yuan, up 30 yuan, with a difference of 20 yuan. The trading volume was light. As for ornamented silver, the listed price was still 14 yuan per tael, and the inter-dealer price also rose to 12.8 and 13 yuan. Yesterday, the interbank lending rate of the Money Trade Association was 14%, and remained unchanged.

Yesterday, the foreign currency market saw the Japanese military yen remain stable and consistently higher. The inter-dealer price was 5.5535 yuan, and the selling price at the counters of banks and small money shops was 5.56 yuan, with a purchase price of 5.55 yuan.

### Tapioca Starch Loosens

Due to sluggish sales of tapioca starch recently, both wholesalers and retailers are reluctant to purchase, so the market has softened. For example, the current market price for the top brand Flying Unicorn is 4,820 yuan, with few takers. The rest will be reduced accordingly.

### Many Reaching Out in Front of Oil Shops: Expecting the Landlord to Be Like Chen Ping Distributing Meat Is Not as Good as Immediately Improving the Distribution Method

Many people were reaching out in front of oil shops, and long queues were in front of nut and dried goods stores, crowded and jostling, complaining and shouting. It's hard to describe in a few words. "A sweet rain after a long drought," no wonder people were rushing to be first, pushing and shoving. The result is nothing more than (1) "First come, first served," (2) It depends on who has the longest arms and the greatest strength to rush forward, buy and leave. The weak sigh and complain, blaming themselves for their lack of strength, either being driven away or pushed away.

Sugar merchants are undoubtedly wealthy, so they only know how to use house rent to buy sugar in large quantities, in other words, only direct taxpayers have sugar to eat, while forgetting that the majority of Shanghai's subtenants, although they can buy sugar with their citizen ID cards, but go and try squeezing, and waiting, women have cooking to do in the morning, and men have their own businesses. Where do they have the leisure to wait and squeeze? Moreover, landlords only need to buy once, while subtenants have to squeeze twenty-five times. Landlords with shrewd calculations can also use citizen ID cards to buy, because the black market prices are so expensive now, they can add a new income in addition to raising the rent. Wanting landlords to distribute sugar to subtenants, it can't be said that there is none, but in history there was only Chen Ping who distributed meat, and can there be landlords who distribute sugar now?

If the gods are fair and impartial, without discrimination, then we can only follow the example of rice and flour, distributed by household. But the so-called by household does not mean that sugar merchants only know the heads of households of landlords, and do not know the heads of affiliated households. Therefore, each household should be the unit, with regular and affiliated households being treated equally, and the amount of oil and sugar to be purchased in a month should be allocated according to the number of people in each household. If it is to save printing costs, one card per household per period can be issued, and the amount that can be purchased on each card should be calculated fairly according to the number of people in each household. If the calculation is too complicated, it is still the rice and flour example, one card per person, and the head of the household gets twice as much as everyone else. This also makes no sense. If sugar is really scarce, we should save on the supply of sugar used to make sweets, cakes, and pastries, to increase the household consumption of sugar.

If there is a sincere intention for fair distribution, even before the oil and sugar purchase certificates are issued, there is no need for house rent receipts or citizen ID cards. Why not temporarily use rice purchase certificates to buy sugar, and flour purchase certificates to buy oil. Just issue a public announcement that the rice and flour certificates for a certain period can be used to purchase a certain amount of oil and sugar, and citizens can use them to purchase from each store according to the amount, and the selling store will add a stamp on the back of each certificate for identification and return it to the original purchaser, without affecting its validity for buying rice and flour.

Doing so will (1) make the distribution fair, (2) allow citizens to avoid squeezing and jostling, shopkeepers can avoid being troubled, (3) those who seek to profit by buying oil and sugar can be stopped, but it is difficult to prevent sellers from hiding and not selling. (4) Citizens can enjoy equally. Even if there is less, there will be no complaints. We benefit a small number of people, ignoring the majority of people, which seems unreasonable and inhuman.

### The Story of Dust and the Thief

— Yuan Ying

In the morning, I opened the window and let the sunlight in.

But, to my surprise, I saw a column of dust slanting from the window to the ground. Countless dust particles were dancing, jumping, and tumbling in the sunlight, slowly, slowly drifting out.

I never thought that this room, which I always thought was the cleanest, would still have so much dust! I thought, if I didn't open the window and let the sunlight in, I certainly wouldn't see so much dust, and I wouldn't be surprised and scared. But, in a room filled with so much dust, I would be breathing all day... I dared not think any further.

Not being able to bask in the sunlight is painful, but when the sunlight comes in and finds a lot of dust that wasn't seen before, people also feel alarmed.

So I thought of another story:

My uncle's family caught a petty thief. Looking closely under the light, it turned out to be a street urchin in the alley. He had been scolded and beaten by my uncle, but he never changed his habit of "stealing". He still often liked to touch other people's things to eat or sell. He wasn't afraid of scolding or beating, and had a bit of a "heroic" spirit.

But this time, my uncle came up with a new punishment for the little thief. He didn't scold or beat him, but tied the little thief's hands and feet and locked him in a small room under the stairs. The room was very dark, so dark that you couldn't see your fingers. It was originally used to store firewood, but after the firewood was burned, it became a storage place for broken furniture. And it was a mud floor, with a musty smell that was quite unpleasant. And since no one had been in there for a long time, it had become a public club for centipedes, rats, and camphor beetles.

However, the little thief walked in without fear and let people tie him to the pillar in this room in the dark, letting the darkness surround him.

A few minutes later, happy songs came out of the dark little room. Although they weren't actual words, they could at least show that the little thief wasn't afraid of this special punishment. For him, it was still just like beating and scolding.

My uncle frowned in defeat, smiling bitterly at me, who was watching from the side. But immediately he thought of a great plan. He turned on the three-bulb electric light inside from the outside - this light hadn't been on for a very long time - and drove away the darkness in the room.

Sure enough, the singing stopped, replaced by exclamations, terrified shouts, because when the light came on, the little thief suddenly saw everything that he hadn't seen in the dark before: centipedes crawling over, camphor beetles coming down the pillar! Scorpions crawling over, crawling in! ...

From exclamation to frantic shouting, from shouting to begging, he shouted, cried, repented, and swore that he would never do bad things again, never be a thief again, and his only request was to quickly get out of this room, the room that he had just walked into without any fear.

So after I opened all the windows, the dust almost disappeared. And according to my uncle, the little thief had also changed for the better since that time.

### Camel

— Lin Yi

—A Small Clerk's Memoir—

What name shall I use to describe myself? A low position, trivial and complicated work, a heavy burden, meager income. Alas! I am simply a camel, like one wading through the boundless desert, not knowing the future, not knowing tomorrow.

Every day is mechanical work, Arabic numerals, pencils, abacus, so every day, so every year.

The cost of living is rising day by day, and my colleagues are mostly unable to bear the heavy pressure of life, and they are complaining incessantly. Everyone hopes to get a little raise. In the writing room, in the mall, people are whispering to each other, "Hey! Is there any hope this month? How much can we probably get?"

Each person received a 100 yuan austerity subsidy this month, and they were overjoyed. This is the result of the one-bowl-of-rice movement every month, weighing themselves and frowning.

The old and the new are changing. The prime minister went to × to recuperate. The new prime minister took office today, and people are panicked, unable to live in peace.

A notice was posted on the bulletin board. This is the new prime minister's first shot, which says that customers should be treated thoughtfully, things should be done carefully, and efficiency should be improved. Some people say that this is old stuff.

Today is payday, the salary is still the original amount, no increase. Looking at the banknotes in hand, calculating with the abacus, firewood, rice, oil, salt, plus rent, what to do?

Work, work, work for life, let the heavy negative pressure add up, because I am a camel, alas!

### Wild Vegetables

— Guo Xian

In the countryside, shepherd's purse and wild goldenrod are fragrant and palatable when cooked, and are said to contain vitamins.

Wild vegetables are neither seeds sown by people, nor do they require irrigation by people. Superstitiously, they are said to be health-preserving plants bestowed upon mankind by nature. However, these are still despised by people, and I regret that they are not grown in foreign countries, so they would be included in the noble cuisine.

People are used to enjoying ready-made things, and they prefer them to appear steaming hot on the ground.

It is difficult to arrange people. If there is nothing to eat, they will say they are starving to death, if there is something to eat, they ignore it.

### Sharing the Same Boat Through Wind and Rain

— He Jia Zhi

— An Enemy

Mrs. Ye Er took out ten yuan. Wei Yunqing did not take the money. First, he cupped his hands. After taking the money, he cupped his hands again and smiled, "Thank you. The Ye family is indeed a family of poetry and propriety, not like those who haggle over every penny. Thank you." He took the ten-yuan bill in his hand and, with a flick of his hand, lifted up his tattered cotton robe and stuffed it in for a long time before he succeeded. Then he smiled, "Your relative, that Miss Bian, how is her elbow?" Mrs. Ye Er glanced at Wei Cheng and said, "Who? Miss Cui Zhen? Wei the wealthy man, I would have forgotten if you hadn't mentioned it. Now that you mention it, I want to ask you, where has Miss Cui Zhen gone? Today is the 30th night of the Lunar New Year, and you should return Cui Zhen to us." Wei Yunqing stroked his beard, parted it to the left and right, opened his mouth and laughed heartily, "Second Sister-in-law, we shouldn't tell lies in front of the truth. I heard people say that Miss Bian has long been in your mansion. That night, the night of the accident, a gust of wind blew, and two of the Eight Immortals, one was Lü Chunyang, and the other was Tieguai Li, Lü Immortal flicked his whisk, and Miss Bian held the whisk in both hands, floating and swaying to your mansion. That Iron Immortal put his crutch against my beastly son's chest, and the beastly son swayed and fell to the ground. How could Miss Bian not be in your mansion?" Wei Cheng opened his mouth, and Mrs. Ye Er hurriedly said, "You're talking nonsense. You heard people say, who said it?" Wei Yunxiang said, "It doesn't hurt to tell you. First, Immortal Hu Da said it, and later others said the same thing, how can I not believe it? Second Sister-in-law, Second Madam, I have only done one thing in my life that was a loss. The money that Fei Changhe swindled away before, I haven't gotten a penny of the principal back, and now I've also lost a beastly son. Haha! I can't cry now, so I laugh. Miss Bian is okay, safe and sound in your mansion." Mrs. Ye Er and Wei Cheng both tried their best to explain that Cui Zhen was missing. Wei Yunqing sighed, asked A Xing for a match, lit the lantern, held the lantern in one hand, and supported himself with his crutch in the other. A Xing helped him carry the blue cloth bag on his shoulder, and pinched him in passing. Wei Yunqing glared at him and walked out of the door. Before he had walked out of the bamboo fence, Huang Long jumped out of the inner room of Shuangmei Study and said, "I'll beat that old thief to death! I'm really so angry that my stomach is about to burst!" Then, Cui Zhen also flashed out. (231)

### The Nanny's Resume

— Lin

In the newspaper, I happened to see a small advertisement from a certain household seeking to hire a nanny.

"...Must be from Beiping, around thirty years old, skilled in cooking and needlework. Please send a resume... If suitable, an interview will be arranged, salary negotiable."

I remember that in the competition for employment, I was once rejected because my resume was too poor. I never thought that resumes would now be used even for hiring nannies, which shows how difficult it is to make a living these days.

In fact, nannies may indeed have boast-worthy resumes, like Zhang Ma, our landlord's nanny.

Zhang Ma is a kind middle-aged woman, and she often feels sorry for me: "A single man living outside, with no one to take care of him, it's really tough!"

She has given a lot of genuine warmth to me, this bachelor teacher living in a small room.

So, she told me more than once about her resume—her unfortunate life story.

She is from Wujiang, her original surname was Wu, her father was a village school teacher, so she also read some books like "Rules for Women" when she was young. When she grew up, she married the young boss of Zhang Wanshun Silver Shop in the city. Soon after, both her parents-in-law died. For more than ten years, she and her husband worked hard to manage the business, and they really accumulated a lot of wealth.

"Two tables of people eating in the shop!" She recalled the glory of the past with a mixture of joy and sadness. But the ruthless gunfire destroyed her home, took away her husband and children, and ruined her life.

Alone, she fled to Shanghai. In order to make a living, she couldn't care about how she used to be flattered. She had to lower her head and serve others. For five years, she has been spending endless years with the kitchen tap and enduring the master's unwarranted scolding.

The nanny's resume brings the bitterness of the world.

### Responding to the "Third-Class Car Movement" Request to Add Third-Class Monthly Tickets

— Pei Kun

I read Mr. Yueke's article "Student Third-Class Car Movement" on October 30th and strongly agree with the opinion that students should be frugal and take third-class trams instead of first-class trams. But having said that, according to my investigation among young students, most of the students who take first-class cars actually have monthly tickets. They originally wanted to save on fares and buy monthly tickets from the tram company, but the French tram company only has first-class monthly tickets. Since the students bought first-class tickets, of course they would take first-class cars. Therefore, to promote this "Third-Class Car Movement", the issue of monthly tickets must be resolved first.

Here, we would like to sincerely request that the French tram company add a third-class monthly ticket in the future, allowing only students and people with legitimate occupations to enjoy the right to buy third-class monthly tickets.

It is deeply believed that this move will not cause any losses to the company, but will bring a lot of convenience to general students and people with legitimate occupations.

It is hoped that people who support the "Student Third-Class Car Movement" will promote the addition of third-class car monthly tickets by the French tram company to become a reality.
