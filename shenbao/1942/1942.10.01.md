This afternoon's German military report stated that German and allied forces in the southwest of the Caucasus and south of the Terek River fought bravely and made further progress. German forces occupied several more areas in the northern district of Stalingrad. The Soviet reinforcements lost 34 tanks. On the Don River front, German-Italian allied forces destroyed the enemy's attempt to cross the river. Last night, our planes heavily bombed several locations in Arkhangelsk, causing large fires. Several Soviet bombers attacked the Baltic region last night and two were shot down.

The Soviet Information Bureau issued a statement on the night of the 29th: (1) Soviet forces fought fiercely with German forces in the areas of Stalingrad, Mostdok, Siniya, and Yino on the 29th. (2) Fierce battles continued in Stalingrad. Today, German tank and infantry units, under the cover of the air force, launched repeated fierce attacks on the northwestern part of Stalingrad, but the Soviet forces still firmly defended their positions. (3) The Volga River Soviet fleet shelled German forces, and Soviet forces took active actions in the northwest of Stalingrad.

German forces in the Caucasus advanced rapidly in the direction of Tuapse, near the suburbs of the port, occupying several factories under strong defense. Although the Soviet Black Sea Fleet fired artillery to prevent the German advance, it was ineffective. In the Caucasus mountains, German engineers continued to occupy many enemy strongholds. Air battles in the Terek region were extremely fierce, and the German air force won a major victory. The battle of Stalingrad is nearing its end. German forces continued to occupy several important buildings in the north. Most of these buildings are connected by underground passages, making the attack particularly difficult. The German forces have also broken into the October Revolution Workers' District.

### German Forces Expand Their Occupied Area to the West Bank of the Volga River

Allied News Agency Telegram from Stockholm, Sweden, 29th

According to London sources, whether Germany can capture Stalingrad is the key to the entire European war situation in the future. The answer to this question is already apparent. However, British observers still believe that the city will eventually fall. In the past few days, the British were quite optimistic due to General Timoshenko's counterattack. Later, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop declared that Germany was fully determined to seize Stalingrad. Therefore, the British believe that the German side will spare no sacrifice to capture Stalingrad within these ten days.

Havas News Agency Telegram from Somewhere on the Soviet Border, 29th

Today is the 164th day of the German-Soviet war. The most noteworthy development of the battle line is that the Axis forces have made significant achievements in the Stalingrad area. After occupying the southern suburbs of Stalingrad, German forces and their allies launched a fierce attack on the defense works of the Communist Party headquarters and finally captured it. At the same time, German forces launched an offensive in the north of the city (where there are many important factories). Currently, the defending forces of the city have lost their main base. German forces have expanded their occupied area to the west bank of the Volga River, which is enough to prevent the Soviets from crossing the river. Therefore, the supply of the defending forces is now in danger of being cut off. However, General Timoshenko's troops are still continuing to launch fierce attacks on the German positions in the north of Stalingrad. The Red Army also launched a major counterattack in the southern suburbs of Stalingrad, attempting to feint to the east and attack the west to contain the German advance, but it did not have a major impact on the military strategy. As for the Caucasus region, the war is still ongoing, especially in the central Terek basin and near the Black Sea port of Tuapse. The battle situation is unknown, but it is only known that the German side claims that the German forces continue to make progress.

### Prime Minister Tojo Broadcasts Gratitude for National Contributions

Allied News Agency Telegram from Tokyo, 30th

Japanese Prime Minister Tojo broadcasted tonight, briefly stating that in the past five years, the Japanese people's contributions to national savings have exceeded ¥50,000,000,000, expressing deep gratitude. The entire nation should strive to complete the important work of the Greater East Asia War. At the same time, the government is determined to complete the purpose of this war by re-establishing governments in Greater East Asia. Due to the expansion of production and the improvement of the national spirit, it is possible to obtain such a large sum of money. Also, because the Japanese people are working hard together, they have achieved brilliant military results domestically, consolidated the internal front, and inspired wartime financial and economic resources. Mobilizing large-scale manpower and material resources in East Asia requires a large amount of funds. If such funds are used for consumption, it will not only hinder the progress of the war but also affect the people's lives. As a result, it is necessary to use this purchasing fund to expand production. I hope that the people will recognize the current situation and engage in wartime production, save consumption, and increase national savings within their respective capacities.

Allied News Agency Telegram from Lisbon, 30th

According to a report from Chongqing, U.S. President Roosevelt's special envoy, Willkie, has arrived in Chongqing from Moscow. Senior officials and British and American ambassadors welcomed him at the airport.

Allied News Agency Telegram from Guangzhou, 30th

According to a report from Chongqing, President Roosevelt's special envoy, Willkie, met with Chiang Kai-shek immediately after arriving in Chongqing from the Soviet Union on the 29th. Willkie will visit Chairman Lin Sen, Army Chief of Staff He Yingqin, and other leaders in Chongqing, and will also visit factories, schools, and other constructions in the city.

Central News Agency Telegram from Stockholm, Sweden, 30th

According to news from London, after President Roosevelt's special envoy, Willkie, arrived in Chongqing, Chongqing will take this opportunity to launch a second front in East Asia and to request and appeal to the United States and Britain regarding the issues such as the Commander of the British-Indian Army Wavell's advocacy of recapturing Burma and rebuilding its route. However, in fact, it is very unlikely to recapture Burma. Both the British and Chongqing are deeply aware of this, so they are discussing restoring the previous camel caravan transportation route, crossing the Himalayas from India, passing through Tibet, and reaching Sichuan, as a new route for material assistance to Chongqing. A British delegation to Chongqing that recently departed from India is currently conducting investigations in the Lhasa area of Xizang. However, this transportation method is labor-intensive and time-consuming, and requires too much land. Even if it is restored immediately, it is difficult to achieve great results. Therefore, although the British and Chongqing authorities are actively negotiating and planning, the general public does not view this optimistically.

### Establishment of the Greater East Asia Ministry Postponed

Central News Agency Telegram from Tokyo, 30th

The Japanese government's previously decided plans for administrative simplification and the establishment of the Greater East Asia Ministry were originally scheduled to be established on October 1. Now, all preparations have been completed and are awaiting formal decision by the Privy Council. However, the Privy Council considers these two cases to be extremely important, so the deliberation work is extremely cautious. Therefore, the realization on October 1 is impossible. The government believes that the administrative simplification and the establishment of the Greater East Asia Ministry are inseparable. The cabinet has also decided on 514 million yen for the administrative simplification, and the cabinet meeting on the 18th has also decided on 1.274 million yen for the establishment fee of the Greater East Asia Ministry, which will be paid from the second reserve fund item. These two cases can be implemented in mid-October after the deliberation by the Privy Council is completed.

Floods have spread along the Chao Phraya River to the central and northern parts of the country and are gradually spreading south, now only tens of kilometers away from the capital, Bangkok. The momentum of this flood is far greater than the flood of 35 years ago. It is expected that the Chao Phraya River will definitely flood into Bangkok in mid-October. The Thai authorities are now actively preparing for flood prevention work. However, from a scientific point of view, this flood will provide sufficient fertilizer to the farmland.

### Berlin Holds Winter Relief Meeting, Hitler Delivers Speech, Goebbels Denies National Socialist Revolution Rumors

Haito News Agency Urgent Telegram from Berlin, 30th

Führer Hitler, accompanied by Propaganda Minister Goebbels and North African German Army Commander Rommel in military uniform, stepped into the Berlin Sports Hall at 6:00 p.m. today (1:00 a.m. on the 1st, Shanghai time) to preside over the Winter Relief Meeting. Goebbels delivered a very simple speech, the main point of which was to refute the rumors propagated abroad that a revolution had taken place in the German National Socialist Party, and to strongly argue that none of the leaders of the National Socialist Party were seriously ill, shot, or exiled. Foreign rumors and slanders are not worth refuting. Germany today is united in politics, military, and economy. Goebbels also mentioned that Germany was very sufficient in raw materials and food when it started in the fourth year after the outbreak of the European War. Germany's major difficulties have already been overcome, and Germany will surely achieve final victory.

Haito News Agency Urgent Telegram from Berlin, 30th

Führer Hitler delivered a speech at the Winter Relief Meeting held in the Berlin Sports Hall today, stating that what he discussed was the current urgent issue rather than the future situation. Then he expressed his opinions on the following issues: (1) Regarding the Eastern Front war situation, Hitler declared that our army will surely occupy Stalingrad and you can rely on it. (2) Regarding the Atlantic Charter, Hitler stated that this kind of foolish document can only be effective for a few years, and will soon be eliminated by the iron facts. (3) Regarding the second front issue, Hitler pointed out that when Churchill first decided to order the British army to attempt a landing in Europe, even people in Britain had differing opinions on whether the location he chose was appropriate. Hitler strongly argued that no matter where Churchill decided to take the risk of a second landing, it would be Churchill's luck if the British army could stay on land for nine hours.

Haito News Agency Telegram from Berlin, 30th

Currency Issues

Havas News Agency Telegram from London, 29th

Finance Minister Wood declared in the House of Commons today that the British government did not want to imitate President Roosevelt's measures to prevent inflation. The government had already clarified its monetary policy in a white paper published in July 1941. This policy was sufficient to prevent the crisis of inflation. When adopting this policy, the Ministry of Finance advised the people to voluntarily reduce the purchase of goods and asked employers not to increase the wages of workers. How to adjust prices and wages still needs to be initiated by private parties. In addition, the system of resolving labor disputes and wage issues by arbitration tribunals is also subject to revision. If the gentlemen of the House of Commons have high opinions on this issue, I am willing to submit them for discussion.

### Admiral Leahy Takes New Post

Therefore, Admiral Leahy is in a position of great influence regarding the various issues of opening a second battlefield.

Havas News Agency Telegram from New York, 29th

U.S. President Roosevelt's special envoy Willkie's remarks in Moscow have aroused widespread discussion in various circles here. Military personnel among them said that we must understand that Germany is a strong continental country, while Britain and the United States can only be called island countries. Therefore, Britain and the United States should not attack Germany from the land, because its weakness is where Britain and the United States are strong. In other words, Britain and the United States should attack Germany from the sea and air. The New York People's Forum newspaper specifically wrote an article commenting on this view, briefly stating that the issue of opening the first battlefield is not the focus of the debate between military leaders, the brave faction, and the weak faction. This move is not a matter of strong will and daring to act. We must understand that whatever decision Britain and the United States make on this matter, it will be a very important factor in the evolution of the current war. The German side relies on a strong continental army with airplanes and submarines as its support. Therefore, any battlefield in Europe in the past has proven that the German army is invincible. Based on this, the main issue for the Allied countries is to decide their attitude on the following three points: (1) Whether to first find a way to destroy the powerful weapons made by German technology (2) Whether to let Germany choose a certain place as the battlefield and immediately fight in that place (3) Whether to give a major blow in the war zone where the Allied countries have already gained or may gain an advantage. In short, the issue of opening a second battlefield should be decided by the army and air force generals.

The enemy army has difficulty advancing on rugged ground and has suffered heavy losses. Although the British army uses tanks, armored vehicles, and heavy artillery in combat, it has not been able to break through the defense line built by the French army in the jungle and is still confined near the capital. Commander Weygand's telegram to Governor Anet yesterday was read to the entire defending army on the island this morning.

Havas News Agency Telegram from Dakar Port, 29th

French West African Governor Boisson recently decided to begin evacuating European women and children who do not need to stay in Dakar Port. There are two motives: (1) After the British troops landed on Madagascar Island, the possibility of Dakar Port being invaded again has become increasingly apparent. (2) There is a surplus of people in the port. Once the situation is urgent, the defending army may not be able to move freely due to the burden of their families. The Governor also ordered an investigation into the number of French citizens and soldiers' families in the port. Families with more than two children should be evacuated to France.

Doctors Guide First Aid Work

According to a key member of the Baojia Department of the Central District of the Public Concession, the district will assign more self-defense team members to stand guard from October 1st to strengthen air defense forces, and order the four Lianbao in the district to organize four first aid teams, and hire Dr. Wang Yijing of Tongren Hospital to be responsible for guidance. As for the Old Zha District, in addition to the self-defense team members standing guard as usual from October 1st, patrol teams will be dispatched to patrol various places. The five Lianbao in the district have also formed five health teams, whose leaders in first aid are Dr. Jiang Zhenxun. According to reporters, the persons responsible for guiding the first aid teams in other districts of the two concessions have also been hired and are all well-known doctors.

Zoning Drills to Stop Starting Today

Yesterday was the last day of the preliminary air defense drills held in the Model District. The only locations where they were held were the Putuo District and Gordon District of the Public Concession. The starting time was 7:30. The French Concession stopped holding preliminary zoning drills last night. According to reporters, the French Concession's Weidang District Civil Police Corps will take over the guarding duties from the Fuxu and Mailan Districts starting today. As for the Xiaodongmen and other districts, they are scheduled to stand guard from the 3rd. The police are now urging all subordinate Baojia groups to quickly establish civil police corps to strengthen police force during air defense drills.

(B) All public rickshaws should paint the six-inch position of their rear mudguards (that is, the one-character boards on both sides) white or paste white paper on them, with two points open. The notice was transferred and informed, hoping that all members would know and abide by it.

The Following Points Should Be Paid More Attention To

1. Upon hearing the air raid siren, remain calm and continue working as usual. 2. Each household should prepare air defense and fire fighting tools in accordance with the regulations of the authorities. 3. Even families that do not use incandescent lights must implement light control. 4. Do not burn paper money or light incense candles at night. 5.

### Baojia Funding Solicitation Conference Yesterday

Total Amount is Two Million Yuan

The Public Concession's organization of Baojia self-defense has achieved remarkable success and has made great contributions to the security within the concession. As for Baojia funding, in the past, each Lianbao was responsible for raising funds individually, which caused financial difficulties. Although the Public Works Department had considered bearing the Baojia funding, it was also unable to balance it due to the huge administrative expenses exceeding the budget. The Baojia authorities, for the sake of social security and the Baojia's future plans, have organized a Baojia self-defense fundraising campaign. A Baojia funding solicitation conference was held at the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association on Ren Yuqing Road at 3 PM both at night and in the afternoon, deciding to raise 2 million yuan in current funds. Fundraising committee members from various industries will be responsible for raising funds separately, and JinCheng, Kenye, and Continental Three Banks are designated to collect the funds. The start and end dates of the fundraising are yet to be determined.

Holidays such as New Year's Day and commemorative days will be notified separately by the authorities.

### Misunderstanding of Tartar

My younger brother saw a slogan on a teeth cleaning advertisement, "Remove tartar." He didn't understand the meaning of tartar and mistakenly thought it was part of the teeth themselves, so he asked, "Won't removing tartar damage the teeth?"

I told him that tartar is waste matter formed by the combination of food debris and saliva left in the gaps between the teeth. It is not part of the teeth at all and is actually harmful to the teeth, so it must be removed.

From this, I feel that translation is very difficult. The term "tartar" is probably translated from Western books. Although the translation is not bad, it is not clear enough, so people who interpret the meaning literally will misunderstand. (Xin Yuan)

### Xu Feng Cleans His Teeth

Movie star Bi Feng visited the Shanghai Teeth Cleaning Institute yesterday and cleaned his teeth at the institute. Mr. Xu believes that scientific teeth cleaning is very necessary in today's situation.

### Immersed in the Allure of Beauty

The Tang Dynasty poet Bai Juyi wrote the Song of Everlasting Regret to record the immortal literary love story of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang and Yang Guifei. The beauty of the words makes people fascinated and immersed in the allure of beauty, which is both song-worthy and tearful.

"The maid helped her up, delicate and weak," the touching words aptly describe her, but they are not as clear as "A smile that turns heads, enchanting all; the beauties of the six palaces pale in comparison." The three thousand beauties all called her a national treasure, all because her smile revealed crystal-clear white teeth and were ashamed of their inferiority. It is no wonder that she could bring down a city with one smile and a nation with another.

"Where are the bright eyes and white teeth now? The blood-stained wandering soul cannot return." It can be seen that bright eyes and white teeth are both essential conditions for a beauty. (Zeng Dao)

### Danish Superstition

According to a book, the Danish have a ridiculous superstition that if they dream of losing a tooth at night, they believe that a relative or friend will die.

This is really too funny. In fact, dreams are false. What does it matter if a tooth falls out in a dream? It is terrible if you find that your real teeth are shaking or falling out, which is a sign of old age. Therefore, everyone should pay special attention to dental hygiene at ordinary times. (Yuan)

### Last Year Today, Training of Female Dental Hygienists Began

The Shanghai Teeth Cleaning Institute recruited female dental hygienists last year. To be cautious, the recruitment procedures were entrusted to the Shanghai Vocational Guidance Institute. At that time, the institute specially appointed the chief examiner, Ms. Zhang Lingqi, to strictly review the qualifications of the candidates, stipulating that they should have a high school education or equivalent academic ability, pure thoughts, good personality, beautiful appearance, and elegant demeanor. At one time, no less than 300 people signed up to apply for the exam. After strict screening, 20 people were admitted and taught all dental knowledge and teeth cleaning techniques by the president, dentist Huang Bingyu, and the director of medical affairs, dentist Ding Xiande. After a long period of training, they began to serve, so each female dental hygienist has deep academic knowledge and rich experience. (Yu)

### Funny Stories and Anecdotes: Teeth Covered with Impurities (Qi)

People Cover Their Noses and Pass By

Fashionable friends pay attention to dressing up. In fact, dressing up is a virtue because a person's appearance is very important. Fashionable friends who enter and exit social occasions need to be well-received, so they must have a good appearance. People who pay attention to appearance must first pay attention to whether their teeth are stained yellow, charred black, or covered with impurities. Otherwise, people will cover their noses and pass by, and they will still not be welcomed.

### Public Works Department's Goods Compilation Section Re-Establishes Fair Prices, Adjusts Production, Wholesale, and Retail Prices, and Asks the Consular Body to Authorize the Management of Various Industries

The English Great Beauty Evening News said that the Allied Press learned today (the 30th) that the Public Works Department's Goods Compilation Section will take measures based on the research currently underway to eliminate differences in retail prices within the Public Concession. The five major department stores in the city, Wing On, Sincere, The Sun, Sun Sun, and China Emporium, submitted a fair price estimate table for more than 1,000 kinds of goods to the Goods Compilation Section yesterday (the 29th). The prices are based on the cost of each item at the end of August plus the company's 11% profit. The Goods Compilation Section is studying this and will compile a fair price list based on this. The person in charge also said that the Public Works Department will seek the opinions and cooperation of the Chamber of Commerce to deal with the entire issue of re-adjusting production, wholesale, and retail prices. For the convenience of the implementation of the price balance plan, the Goods Compilation Section has applied to the Consular Body for authorization to manage various industry associations, so that it can implement the license and registration system. If the Goods Compilation Section obtains this authority, it can manage the more than 50 industry associations that currently exist in the Public Concession. At that time, the Public Works Department will establish an industry association guidance section within the Goods Compilation Section to organize various industry associations by restricting membership methods.

### Public Debt Trading is Light

The off-exchange trading of public debt in the black market has slightly decreased. Except for a few shorts covering their positions, there are very few new buyers. Sellers are still enthusiastic. Recently, large long positions have mostly emerged and are no longer as interested as before. Therefore, investors are shrinking their hands, people's hearts are flustered, rumors are endless, and floating positions are selling off their chips one after another, so the pressure is easing again. Yesterday, the C bond still had a fluctuation of one yuan. It was seen at 3.5 yuan at the beginning. Because of the short covering by the bulls, the price was 2.3 yuan, and then it was raised to 3.8 yuan due to the short covering. Finally, it continued to fall by 60-70 cents to about 3.5-6 yuan. The A bond still failed to exceed the C bond, and its price was only 3.5 yuan, continuing to fall by 50 cents.

The turnover was about 1 million yuan.

### Despite Weakness, Cotton Cloth Dealers Reluctant to Lower Prices

Factory Cloth

Yesterday, the market lacked vitality due to the continued decline of Dong cloth. However, major dealers were reluctant to lower prices. As a result, heavy coarse cloth became scarce and prices rose. 16-pound Globe coarse cloth required 188 yuan, and Flying Swan required 185.5 yuan. Light cloth fell by 5 jiao. 9-pound New Character was offered for sale at 110 yuan, and 8-pound Zhenzhong at 107 yuan.

### Extreme Scarcity of Da Guang Leather

Eager Buyers Meet Everywhere

The market for standard-grade, 36-foot Da Guang leather is extremely short in circulation. Since yesterday, influenced by the influx of Northbound merchants, the quiet market has regained its enthusiasm. Unfortunately, the varieties of Da Guang leather are insufficient, and buyers frequently encounter obstacles. Therefore, printing factories, water bottle factories, and scattered users have switched to using Touzi goods and black iron blanks. However, purchasing standard-grade varieties is particularly difficult, and those holding goods have high expectations. The market is stable and firm. Standard-grade goods are priced at 20,000 yuan per ton, 20-grade Touzi goods at 16,000 yuan, 12-14 grade varieties at 14,000 yuan, and 2,000-pound black iron blanks at 15,000 yuan.

### Stable and Firm Situation for Beans

The bean market was firm yesterday, with limited arrivals and brisk sales, resulting in more demand than supply. 30 bags of Tianjin red beans were priced at 165 yuan, and 50 bags of Chongming sandy red beans were priced at 164 yuan. More than 30 bags of sandy silkworm beans were priced at 150 yuan. Arrivals and sales of red sorghum were low, and the market was stable. One truckload of Mingguang red sorghum was priced at 114.7 jiao.

The supply and demand for dried sweet potatoes were balanced, and the market was stable. Yesterday, a single silk bag of 60 bags of Jiangbei dried sweet potatoes was priced at 126 yuan.

Yesterday, bean cakes from nearby suburban areas of this town were priced at 61.3 jiao.

### The Edible Oil Trade Wholesale Bureau Strives to Increase Production

To maintain the people's food supply, the Shanghai Edible Oil Trade Wholesale Bureau has not only made every effort to dredge the source but also strived to increase the production of its own factories.

### Theologians and Philosophers

— Tang Mu

It is said that once a theologian and a philosopher had a fierce debate. The theologian satirized the philosopher, saying that a philosopher is like a blind man looking for a black cat in a dark room, but there is actually no black cat in the room. The philosopher retorted, "Perhaps that's the case, but the theologian actually found a cat in an empty room."

I don't know how many people in society are blindfolded, turning around in dark rooms looking for black cats that aren't in the room. And I don't know how many people think they have found black cats that don't exist.

### Small Shortcomings

— Translated by Ni Xiuxia

Don't neglect small shortcomings. The smallest enemies will become harmful in the long run. It is not the masses that ravaged crops and caused disasters in northern China, but locusts and small butterfly pupae.

Furthermore, a small shortcoming is definitely not a small matter. The smallest shortcoming can affect a masterpiece, and small is often the beginning of big. Nothing grows and increases faster than a small shortcoming, and nothing reproduces faster. A small black spot on a tooth is a small matter, but if you don't go to the dentist immediately, the entire tooth will soon be decayed. And once a tooth is decayed, if you still don't pull it out, then the adjacent teeth will also decay, and then the adjacent teeth will also decay, and the entire mouth will be full of decayed teeth.

The willingness to commit small shortcomings is also absolutely not irrelevant. This is enough to cause greater damage. In conclusion, a small shortcoming that is not corrected can prevent us from doing good. The thinnest thorn left in a lion's foot can prevent the king of beasts from flying. A grain of sand in your shoe can cause you to stop halfway when you participate in a track and field competition. So the smallest shortcoming is more terrible than a lion. A light thorn is a small grain of sand that defeats the most reputable runners and takes away his championship.

These small shortcomings can cause great danger, perhaps because of their smallness. Their insignificant appearance makes people often regard small shortcomings as things that don't need to be worried about and are fun to keep. This kind of view is a very dangerous mistake. Rust is just a brown spot on a shiny metal surface at first, but if it is not removed quickly, it will penetrate the entire piece of steel. The woodworm is just a small, pitiful worm at first. The Dutch know very well that although its body is small and pitiful, it can penetrate the strongest seawall in the world and cause great disasters. This small worm symbolizes many uncorrected small shortcomings that cause great disasters in life.

Don't underestimate your small shortcomings. Accept good advice with careful and grateful ears. From now on, comprehensively remove them. In youth, these small shortcomings are often just the larvae of harmful things. It is easier to catch or kill them before they grow, otherwise they will attack us and cause us to die.

Change immediately. It may be too late if you delay.

### Clothing, Food, and Honor and Disgrace

— Du Boqing

There are three kinds of people in the world. The first kind of person knows honor and disgrace after having enough clothing and food. The second kind of person knows honor and disgrace even without enough clothing and food. The third kind of person knows nothing of honor or disgrace even when they are clothed and fed.

In terms of life, the second kind of person is miserable, and the third kind of person is happy.

In terms of morality, the second kind of person is noble, and the third kind of person is base.

In terms of national law, the second kind of person should be praised, and the third kind of person should be pickled in brine.

### A Letter Sponsoring Fundraising to Help with Meals

— Ni Xiang Sheng

The YMCA specially launched a campaign to help poor students with meals in order to solve the problem of eating for poor students. After the news was published, we received a letter from this enthusiastic reader and attached five yuan of savings from meals to show their warm support for this campaign. In addition to having transferred the donation to the Student Relief Committee of the YMCA, we specially publish this deeply moving letter in the hope that other readers will also continue to respond in order to accomplish the full success of helping students. Please send donations directly to the YMCA at Eight Immortals Bridge or the YWCA at No. 638 Weihaiwei Road to avoid additional transfer procedures - Editor

This morning, I stole a few minutes to read the newspaper in the writing room. I accidentally saw the news that the YMCA launched a campaign to help poor students with meals. This news moved me very much.

I am a servant at a Jewish doctor's office, or as most people call it, a "boy." But before that, I was also a poor student who didn't have enough tuition fees, and when I did, I didn't have enough money for transportation or meals. Because of this, not only do I know the situation of poor students in detail, but I have also experienced it myself. At the beginning of each semester, I always ran to the pawnshop several times and visited several relatives who could give me some financial help. But this was only once per semester, twice a year. What made me feel really difficult in the life of studying hard and studying poorly was still eating.

It's really a feeling that poor, or even not so poor, classmates may have experienced. We may all have had the embarrassment of lingering in front of a restaurant and hesitating to step in. Poor students are certainly afraid that they won't be able to eat or pay the bill because of the limited money in their pockets. Even students who are not so poor are afraid of not being able to eat hygienic food and of not being able to bear the price of the car and the habits of ordinary restaurants.

Although I am no longer a student and I no longer have to run to the pawnshop twice a year to pay tuition, I am still a boy with a meager salary and a low status. The problem of eating is still threatening me every day. I have not forgotten, and cannot forget, the painful feeling I had when I was studying. Moreover, I remember it even more clearly because meals have risen to four or five yuan a serving. This is why I was particularly happy to pay attention to the news of the YMCA helping students with meals.

Here is a deposit of five yuan. This is the money I saved from meals today. Please send it to the authorities in charge of the YMCA as a sign of my agreement with and response to their campaign to help students with meals. I know very well that my five yuan will definitely not be able to subsidize a poor student's expenses for a day. But in Shanghai, there are still benevolent and generous people who can spare thousands of times more than me. Such good deeds will be completed by them, I hope so. I believe that tens of millions of poor students also hope so for them. I wish

### A Glimpse into the Money Industry

— Xiao Wei

(3) The Silver Rice Bowl and the Money Shop Fellows

Some people envy friends who eat from the bank and money shops, because they hold a silver rice bowl. It is true that in terms of treatment, the money industry is considered to be more generous than other industries. Taking money shops as an example, the salary of at least the staff is always above 100 new yuan. In addition to providing meals and accommodation, there are also bonuses at the end of the year. But in today's era when banknotes are worthless, 100 yuan can only be used as 10 yuan. It may be enough for a bachelor to support himself, but friends with families feel that they can't make ends meet. Therefore, there are those who pre-pay their monthly salary, those who find side jobs outside, and even those who have too much debt to make up for and run away. How would outsiders know about these kinds of depression? To talk about ingratiating oneself to hope for promotion to runner or money room positions, it may depend on whether you have a close relationship with the manager or assistant manager. If you are not from their gang (Shanghai money shops have Ningbo gangs, Zhenjiang gangs, etc., which attract fellow villagers and form forces) and you are not good at flattering, then you have to be prepared to sit on the bench for a few years. Other professional fields certainly have this as well.

As for the daily work of old-fashioned money shops, it is not very complicated. As long as you can write old-style numbers and know how to use an abacus, elementary school graduates can cope. Unlike bank staff, who must understand new-style bookkeeping and accounting, etc., special knowledge. But where there is benefit, there is also harm. Therefore, many people are trained without specialized knowledge and skills. Once unemployed, it is very difficult to find other jobs. As a result, not only do they suffer themselves, but society also has one more useless person. Furthermore, a group of young people with unstable wills join old-fashioned money shops. All they see and touch every day is money. They live in an atmosphere of money and have few other thoughts. After work, those who go up go to inquire about market conditions and contact relatives and friends to try to fulfill their gold dream of buying and selling short. Those who go down associate with bad friends, play cards, watch plays, and gamble wildly. Therefore, there are also many people who are in debt, lose money, commit fraud, and eat officials. Just look at the protagonists of this type of news in the newspaper, most of them are young people who worship the silver rice bowl. It is easy to shake it up, but it is not difficult to lose it, because their work activities are completely directed by money. After their experience increases, they often become its prisoners.

So in the end, I have to advise a group of young students not to snipe in without preparation. At the same time, those who have held this silver rice bowl should be vigilant in times of peace, and use their spare time to study specialized knowledge in order to avoid being eliminated by the giant wheel of the times.

### Sharing the Same Boat in Storms

— He Jia Zhi

(9) Hell on Earth

This is a bit like the weather, sometimes sunny and sometimes rainy. Just now it was a storm, but now the sky is clear. Cui Zhen is paralyzed on the bed with half her life left. The person watching over her is constantly in and out of the house. Sometimes she brings in hot meals and dishes. A-ying reveals a smile, rolls up her sleeves, walks to the bed and says to Cui Zhen, "You didn't understand before, causing our younger brother to suffer and yourself to suffer. Now you should understand. Sit up and eat. There's not much in the way of dishes. There's vegetable glue stir-fried meat shreds, stuffed flatbread, stir-fried vegetables, white pork radish soup, and a dish of meat slices stir-fried with shepherd's purse. We who were born in the countryside all like to eat meat. You're the same, right? Get up, get up." A-ying is considered close to Cui Zhen. While she speaks, she pulls Cui Zhen up. Cui Zhen feels nauseous and doesn't accept the temptation of the delicacies. She is pulled up and falls back down again. A-ying curses a few dozen times before she says, "I don't want to eat." A-ying laughs, "So you still don't understand that I'm inviting you to eat because I think highly of you. When we hit, we hit, and when we scolded, we scolded. After hitting and scolding, my younger brother and I have the same temper. Get up for yourself."

How could Cui Zhen listen to A-ying's words? A-ying secretly cursed "doesn't know how to appreciate favors," and instructed outside, "The meat slices stir-fried with shepherd's purse don't need to be brought up." The dishes in the room were taken out. The person outside responded loudly, took an empty plate, and took the dishes out one by one. A-ying still wanted to make her last effort. She put her hands on her waist and forced a smile, "You don't know how good my younger brother is to women. The one at home is much worse than you. How does my younger brother treat her? They eat at the same table and sleep in the same bed. When the weather is cold, he naturally touches her clothes and asks, 'Are you cold?' Since you're the one at home who is still treated like this, he'll naturally raise you to the sky." As she said this, Wei Shaoyun walked in with a group of people and said, "Sister, are you talking to Cui Zhen? Hurry up and eat, oh. Did you accompany her to eat? How much did you eat?" A-ying explained the process of Cui Zhen refusing to eat. Wei Shaoyun said, "It doesn't matter, not eating won't kill you. We've already discussed a solution outside." (191)
