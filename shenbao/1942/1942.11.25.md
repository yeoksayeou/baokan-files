### Minister Okafuchi's Speech on the First Anniversary of Joining the Anti-Comintern Pact

Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency telegraph) - The 25th marks the first anniversary of our country's participation in the International Anti-Comintern Pact. Japanese Embassy Information Minister Okafuchi delivered the following speech yesterday: "Today marks the first anniversary of the National Government's participation in the Anti-Comintern Pact on November 25th of last year. I am deeply moved. The Anti-Comintern Pact was first concluded between Japan and Germany in the 25th year of the Republic of China to jointly prevent and suppress the activities of the Communist Party, the enemy of world civilization. Italy joined the following year, and subsequently Manchukuo, Hungary, and Spain also joined the alliance, totaling six countries.

The National Government has resolutely moved to expel the Communist Party, which is eroding China. This is a cause for celebration for the defense of Chinese civilization, for the sake of China, and for the sake of Asia."

### Soviet Offensive in Don River Bend Blocked; Axis Forces Restore Original Positions; Large Number of Soviet Tanks Destroyed

Berlin, 24th (Haitong News Agency telegraph) - Military sources stated yesterday that the Soviet army launched a major offensive in the Don River bend and the Kalmyk region south of Stalingrad, and once broke through the German defense line. Now, this gap in the defense line has been sealed by the Axis forces. After the Axis counter-attack, a large number of enemy tanks were destroyed, cutting off their connection with the rear. The German and Romanian armies arranged their positions within the first three days of the Soviet offensive as a stronghold for counter-attack. The Soviet army in the Kalmyk region made considerable progress in the first two days of the offensive, taking advantage of its numerical superiority, but the rear transportation lines of its advancing troops were cut off by the German army, so the fuel supply tended to be cut off. The German and Romanian armies launched a counter-attack on Monday, finally driving back the Soviet army between Krasno and Amisk, with more than 50% of the enemy soldiers being killed.

Berlin, 24th (Haitong News Agency telegraph) - Recent reports from the Eastern Front state that the Don River bend and the area south of Stalingrad, where the Soviet army launched a large-scale offensive, are completely under the control of the German and Romanian armies. Although the Soviet army broke into the German defense line at several points, this is an inevitable phenomenon in the initial stages of a major offensive, and Berlin does not attach importance to it. The invading enemy troops will soon be surrounded. Although the Soviet side reported victories, there are no concrete facts to prove it, and it is not credible. No war reports have been received from Duyapurs and Stalingrad last night. The German army in the Terek region is intensifying its encirclement of the enemy army. The Soviet counter-attack south of Nalchik was repelled. The Soviet army also attempted to attack south of Lake Ilmen, but retreated without success.

Berlin, 24th (Haitong News Agency telegraph) - The German positions broken through by the Soviet army on the Seraphimovich front on the Eastern Front were restored yesterday by a flanking attack launched by the Romanian army. A large number of Soviet tanks were intercepted, and their infantry was cut off. In the battle in the Gormark grasslands south of Stalingrad, the Soviet offensive was repelled yesterday by a counter-attack by the German and Romanian allied forces.

Berlin, 23rd (Havas News Agency telegraph) - According to recent war news from the Eastern Front, the German army on the Caucasian front again made progress yesterday. The details are as follows: The fighting near Nalchik in the southern region is becoming increasingly fierce. The German and Romanian allied forces repeatedly launched offensives in the foothills, directly attacking the enemy's transportation routes, with considerable success. A large number of enemy motorized units were annihilated en route. Two regiments of our advance troops in the Terak region, after meeting from both sides, surrounded a team of the Red Army, achieving a great victory. The Red Army's several incursions in this area were repelled by our side. The Red Army's repeated attacks south of Stalingrad and in the Don River basin have not been successful and have suffered losses. In the last battle, the Red Army lost 600 officers and soldiers and 25 tanks. In addition, as a result of our aircraft assisting in the battle, 10 enemy tanks and 50 other trucks were destroyed. Although the Red Army disregarded significant losses, they still took the offensive. The Red Army, which was dispersed by our side southeast of Mei Gupu, attacked our mountain ridge position again. Several teams of our army fought fiercely with them with the assistance of aircraft. Afterwards, 200 enemy soldiers were killed by our army, including four political commissars. In addition, our army also occupied two enemy warehouses, with many war horses.

### US Aircraft Participate in Bombing of Europe

Lisbon, 23rd (Allied News Agency telegraph) - British and Canadian joint bomber formations attacked the important industrial area of ​​Vatzsizgart in southwestern Germany on the night of the 22nd. Another formation bombed the northern French coast and bombed the ports of Saint-Nazaire and Lorient on the west coast of France on the afternoon of the 23rd. According to the British Air Force authorities, this bombing is the latest large-scale bombing of Germany, but due to the attacks by German fighter planes and anti-aircraft guns, British aircraft seem to have suffered heavy losses.

Bern, Switzerland, 23rd (Havas News Agency telegraph) - The British official gazette announced that American bombers, under the cover of fighter planes, bombed the occupied French ports of Saint-Nazaire and Lorient again.

Berlin, 23rd (Allied News Agency telegraph) - The German military authorities announced that thirty British four-engine bombers attacked the west coast of France at noon on the 23rd.

Lisbon, 24th (Allied News Agency telegraph) - Former US Ambassador to Japan, Grew, said in a speech in Lake City, USA yesterday, "Japan is becoming increasingly powerful. Not only is it equal to the United States, but its latent military strength exceeds that of the United States. Only by matching it with equal or greater strength in material and spirit can it be defeated. If we lose one day in attacking Japan, its inferiority is no different from losing a ship. We are extremely impatient and must not be careless. We must not engage in futile arguments, dispersion, and indecisiveness."

### Partial Reorganization of the British Cabinet; People from Various Countries Comment

Bern, Switzerland, 23rd (Havas News Agency telegraph) - According to recent news from London, the leader of the British House of Lords, Lord Cranborne, is about to join the wartime cabinet to better implement his duties. In addition, according to official announcements, Sir Stafford Cripps, after being transferred to Minister of Aircraft Production, will also serve as Vice Chairman of the Anti-Submarine Warfare Committee, with Prime Minister Churchill himself serving as Chairman.

Bern, Switzerland, 23rd (Havas News Agency telegraph) - The Neue Zürcher Zeitung carried a dispatch from London stating that the British people were deeply surprised by the cabinet reshuffle. Although Sir Stafford Cripps had shown his loyalty to his duties in the wartime cabinet, he was not entirely suitable for the position and often disagreed with Prime Minister Churchill. In recent weeks, Sir Stafford Cripps has been approaching people without political affiliations, sympathizing with the economic and social proposals of people who are neither Labour nor Conservative party members, thus abandoning his traditional party affiliation. He has recently strongly supported the Archbishop of Canterbury's remarks. In short, Cripps' departure from the wartime cabinet and his transfer to Minister of Aircraft Production can be explained as his temporary departure from the political stage, and he will now focus on administrative work. Conservative Party members are very satisfied with Eden's succession to Cripps as Speaker of the House of Commons.

Zurich, 24th (Allied News Agency telegraph) - According to dispatches from London, all the newspapers in London today published news of the British cabinet reshuffle in an important position and added comments. The London Times said that Cripps' transfer to Minister of Aircraft Production will directly participate in the operation, but he has completely no right to speak on the British government's policy guidance. The Manchester Guardian said that Morrison's entry into the cabinet is not surprising, but Cripps' withdrawal from the cabinet is unexpected. As a result, Cripps is likely to eventually step down. As for the fact that Morrison's entry into the cabinet has greatly strengthened the Labour Party's position in the cabinet, and at the same time, because Eden took office as Speaker of the House of Commons, the Conservative Party can also be satisfied. Also, the Daily Express said, "Cranborne was transferred from Colonial Secretary to Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, not directly responsible for administrative duties. Is this a temporary measure because Cranborne will succeed Linlithgow as Governor-General of India?"

Berlin, 23rd (Allied News Agency telegraph) - The German foreign authorities recently expressed their opinions on the reorganization of the British cabinet, saying, "When we consider the experience of Cripps being expelled from the wartime cabinet, we know that Churchill has finally adopted a dictatorial and autocratic approach, and does not allow some signs of opposition or dissenting opinions in the cabinet. After Cripps was expelled, the British government's policies towards India and other colonies have been completely promoted in accordance with the principles of imperialism."

### Spain Expresses Determination to Maintain Neutrality; National Executive Committee of Falange Reorganized

Madrid, 24th (Allied News Agency) - Since the Allied forces of Britain and the United States invaded French North Africa, Spain's movements have attracted considerable attention worldwide. Now that the North African war has passed its tenth day, judging from the current situation in Spain, despite this extraordinary period, its neutral stance has not undergone drastic changes. There are two reasons for this: Spain's national strength has recovered, but if it were to participate in the war, it would lack adequate preparation in terms of both morale and materials. Britain and the United States are using Spain and Portugal as bases for their strategies against Europe, adopting a friendly diplomacy towards various countries, just as they used to treat France. Furthermore, there is much speculation about the new mobilization plan announced by the Spanish government on the 19th, with various opinions differing. Observers here believe that this mobilization by the Spanish government is a defensive measure that does not hinder neutrality. This is because part of the Allied forces of Britain and the United States has already invaded Spanish Morocco, and 300 people have been arrested, and Allied aircraft have landed in Spanish territory. According to reliable sources, Spain and Portugal will take advantage of this situation to issue another statement, reaffirming their neutrality. It is generally believed that the Spanish government will consistently adhere to its neutrality policy.

Madrid, 23rd (Havas) - Head of State Franco today issued an order to revise the organization of the National Executive Committee of the Falange as follows: The number of executive committee members is set at 116; General Franco will serve as the Chairman and Secretary-General of the Falange; in addition to Head of State Franco himself, the executive committee members will include the Speaker of the House of Representatives, all cabinet members, ten army generals, two naval generals, and several other senior military officers.

Africa in the Midst of Tumultuous Changes

### French West Africa on the Verge of Storm (3)

The Ivory Coast is located between Liberia, the only independent republic in Africa, and the British Gold Coast, and borders French Guinea and French Sudan. Although France declared the area to be French territory as early as 1842, it was not until 1882 that it occupied it. On January 1, 1933, part of the upper Volta River was incorporated into the Ivory Coast, thus expanding its area to a total of 180,802 square miles. According to a 1935 census, there were 3,847,613 natives and 3,124 Europeans, most of whom were French. The capital of this territory was originally in Bingerville but was later moved to Abidjan, but the former capital is still the educational center of French West Africa, with many schools, including numerous government-run schools. The curriculum prioritizes French as the first foreign language and English as the second. The Ivory Coast can also be said to be the most fertile land in French West Africa, not inferior to French Guinea. Its main products include peanuts, corn, rice, bananas, pineapples, and various other fruits, and cocoa has begun to be cultivated experimentally. The yield of cocoa increased from four tons (the yield from 1904 to 1908) to 43,565 tons in 1935, a staggering increase. In addition, cotton and rubber are also being cultivated experimentally, with excellent results. Therefore, the Ivory Coast's annual exports are mainly coconuts, cocoa, coffee, and timber. Imports consist mainly of cotton fabrics, kerosene, liquors, automobiles, and other metal products. Each year, there is a surplus of exports. In terms of minerals, French Ivory Coast also has considerable reserves. In addition to gold mines, there are also manganese mines necessary for the manufacture of aircraft, which are very important for national defense industries. The territory's transportation, highways, and railways are well-developed and very convenient.

The Colony of the Niger is located north of British Nigeria and south of the Sahara Desert. This colony was established by order of the French government on October 13, 1922. Later, the French government incorporated the regions of Toureg and Fada into the Niger Colony, thus expanding the land. The total area is approximately 499,42 square miles, and the population, according to a 1937 survey, reached 1,733,705, including 453 Europeans, of whom 412 were French. This colony can be divided into three regions based on the fertility of the land. The northern part is barren and impoverished, almost a desolate area. The central part is a forest zone, covered in dense thickets, where poisonous snakes and fierce beasts roam. The southern part is grassland, suitable for agriculture and animal husbandry, producing cotton, corn, tobacco, and wheat. Generally speaking, the people's economic life is mainly based on animal husbandry. A 1937 survey showed that there were 63,377 horses, 685,683 cattle, 2,483,580 sheep, 155,367 donkeys, and 49,575 camels. When we study the reasons for the undeveloped agriculture in the Niger colony, we can summarize it in one sentence: except for the Niger River basin and Lake Chad, there is a lack of rainfall in all areas. In 1936, foreign trade exports amounted to 49,220,172 francs, and imports amounted to 28,603,374 francs. The most peculiar thing about the Niger colony is the existence of giant ants. The local people live a tent-like existence. The giant ants often invade the tents, preventing people from sleeping peacefully, especially the Europeans who travel there for the first time, who are alarmed and retreat at the sight of these giant ants.

Dahomey is located between British Nigeria and the Gold Coast, bordered to the north by the French Niger Colony, and to the south by the Gulf of Guinea. The French gained a foothold in the area in 1851 and gradually invaded the Kingdom of Dahomey, which was incorporated into the French colonial empire in 1894. The coastline is only 70 miles long, but it extends northward into the interior, covering an area of approximately 41,302 square miles. According to a 1935 survey, the population totaled 1,351,511, including 909 Europeans. Porto-Novo is the capital and also a commercial center. Education is widespread throughout the territory, with schools of all levels established in various locations. In 1935, education expenses amounted to 1,802,185 francs. The natives are purely black, engaged in agricultural work in the coastal areas, living comfortably. The main products are coconuts, wheat, and corn. Recently, the experimental cultivation of cotton has yielded excellent results. In the southern provinces, the experimental cultivation of coffee has also achieved good results. In 1935, imports amounted to 56,338,607 francs, while exports amounted to 55,470,000 francs.

Senegal is the land in Africa that produces peanuts. The local natives rely on the Senegal River, which traverses the territory, and everyone grows peanuts. Annual peanut exports reach over 100 million pounds. Peanuts are not only a food item but can also be used to make edible oil, which is of great importance today when there is a shortage of vegetable oil. This territory is located on the western edge of Africa, bordered by Mauritania to the north and British Gambia to the south, covering an area of 77,730 square miles, with a population of 1,697,671, including 86,671 Europeans. The natives there, whom we call the Ouolofs, have a capital that is an ancient city, Saint Louis, which opened in 1658 and serves as the gateway to French West Africa. The soil within the territory is mostly sandy, and in addition to producing peanuts, rice and corn can also be grown, but the yield is not high. In 1935, foreign trade imports amounted to 467,369,291 francs, and exports amounted to 441,459,756 francs. In addition, Senegal's animal husbandry is also quite developed. A 1934 survey showed that there were 104,000 sheep, 355,000 cattle, 60,000 donkeys, and 40,004 horses.

As for transportation, it is more developed than in any other territory. On the western extreme is a key port, which is not only the seat of the Governor-General of French Southwest Africa but also France's only naval base in West Africa. This is the Port of Dakar, which is valued by Britain and the United States. In addition to having a railway connecting it to the capital city of Saint Louis, there is also a railway directly to Bamako, the capital of French Sudan. Although the port is geographically located within the territory of Senegal, administratively it does not belong to Senegal but is independent, forming its own unit. The French call it "The Special Territory of Dakar and its Dependencies." A detailed description of the port will be provided in detail below.

The objectives and foundations of price control in the Shanghai area have recently been agreed upon by the Price Control Committee as follows: (1) Establish an appropriate price based on the prices of essential goods in the economic center, with reference to the prices before the exchange of old and new currencies in May of this year; (2) Reduce coal prices and seek moderate rice prices; (3) In order to expand production, collect inland goods as much as possible, strive to obtain raw materials from North China, Mengjiang, Manchuria, and the South, and prevent the accumulation of goods in various regions; (4) Absorb idle capital and use it for production. In order to realize this, the Price Control Committee will be the center, and various agencies will assist in the process.

Make All Prices Moderate

The above four major guidelines are the main pillars for implementing price controls. The more detailed content can be divided into seven items: (1) Take the prices before the exchange of new and old currencies in May of this year as the target for controlling prices, in order to gradually stabilize them; (2) The Price Control Committee will be the center of price control, guided by relevant agencies, and comprehensively research and plan; (3) Appropriate prices will be temporarily targeted at essential goods in the economic center, agreed upon by private organizations, and then implemented after approval by administrative authorities. Among them, coal prices will be reduced, and rice prices will be adjusted so that other prices can be reduced accordingly. Other expenses such as electricity, transportation, wages, land rent, housing, loan interest, and profits will also be moderated;

Promote Production; Adjust Supply and Demand

(4) Promote the increased production of inland goods and the collection of raw materials from various regions in order to adjust the supply and demand of goods. At the same time, the agencies that handle the allocation of goods will be adjusted, a common price system will be adopted, and the manipulation of the market and speculative trading will be prohibited. Practical and normal measures will be implemented for rice and other essential goods; (5) Regarding the restriction of the movement of important goods, it is strictly forbidden to move them to other areas. As for movement within the jurisdiction, under the control of the authorities, the restrictions will be eased as much as possible, and efforts will be made to avoid accumulation in a certain area. At the same time, the rationalization of transportation will be sought in order to facilitate the smooth exchange of goods; (6) In order to facilitate the smooth implementation of currency policies based on the new legal tender and to expand the circulation of the new legal tender, idle capital will be absorbed and used for production; (7) Regarding the suppression of prices, private groups will be encouraged to take the initiative, and the economic police mechanism will be strengthened;

### Japanese Merchants Limit Cloth Prices to Assist in Maintenance

Stop Selling Above Price This Month; Contracts Already Signed to be Delivered This Month

It is heard that the Shanghai Japanese Cotton Industry Association recently held a temporary meeting at the Japanese Club and decided to fully assist the authorities in maintaining the price limit for cloth. The methods are as follows: (1) The highest price for cloth has been set and will be implemented from December 1st, but new transactions exceeding this highest price will not be conducted in mid-November; (2) Transactions that have already been contracted, if they exceed the highest price, can still be fulfilled according to the contract within November, but not after December; (3) Transactions that have already been contracted that exceed the highest price, if they cannot be completed within November, must be terminated. The principle of termination is that both parties should resolve the matter appropriately by taking a suitable price between the contracted price and the highest price; (4) New transactions will not be conducted for brands for which the highest price has not yet been announced. As for those already contracted, if the delivery date is within November, they can be fulfilled according to the contract; otherwise, they must wait for the announcement of the highest price before delivery, etc.

### Reduction in Electricity Fees Not Yet Notified

Gas Fee Reduction Already Confirmed

The English "Shanghai Times" reported that gas fees in the Public Concession and the French Concession will be reduced by 11% from December 1st. This has recently been confirmed by Mr. Tajima, Assistant Secretary of the Shanghai Gas Company. However, personnel from the Shanghai Power Company said that they had not received notification from the management company (Central China Water and Electricity Company) to reduce electricity fees from next month. In addition, when reporters asked Mr. Ducles, Manager of the Shanghai French Electricity Company, about the reduction of electricity fees in the French Concession, he replied that he could not comment on this matter at all. The electricity and power fees in the French Concession all depend on the price charged by the Shanghai Power Company to the French Company. The Shanghai Power Company supplies 90% to 95% of the electricity consumed in the French Concession. If the Shanghai Power Company reduces electricity fees, the users in the French Concession will naturally benefit greatly.

### Shanghai and Singapore Conduct Material Exchange

In order to develop Shanghai's foreign trade, with the assistance of the authorities, various industries in Shanghai are making every effort to communicate trade with various places in Southeast Asia. In addition to having agreed on barter trade between Shanghai and the Philippines, material exchanges are now being conducted with Singapore. Goods transported from Shanghai to Singapore include soap, matches, cotton cloth, silk, etc. At the same time, raw materials needed by Shanghai, such as oil and rubber, will be transported from Singapore to Shanghai.

### Major Theft on Public Bus No. 22 Yesterday Morning; Leather Bag Slashed by Passenger in Adjacent Seat; Two People Forcibly Exited Along the Way

On the morning of the 24th of this month, a Chinese man was carrying a leather bag containing $15,000 in cash and foreign currency on Edward Road and boarded a public bus. On the way, he discovered that a passenger in an adjacent seat had slashed his leather bag. He immediately pointed out the thief and notified the ticket seller. When the bus reached the intersection of Avenue Foch and Route Say Zo Se, two Chinese passengers in the bus asked the ticket seller to open the door to let them off. When the ticket seller refused, the two men beat the ticket seller, forcibly opened the door, and got off the bus. The thief also took the opportunity to escape. The police station received a report after the incident and is currently investigating.

### Yü Mao Official Salt Company Plans to Grant Salt Based on Baojia Areas; Authorities in Both Concessions Have Not Approved This

The English "Shanghai Times" reports that just hours after the Yü Mao Official Salt Company officially announced that salt would be distributed per capita starting December 1st, salt merchants in both concessions considered it a rare commodity and only sold small quantities of salt, with prices already much higher than before.

Monopoly Started Before Implementation

Large shops in both concessions continued to sell salt on the 23rd, while small food stores refused to sell salt unless customers were willing to pay a high price. Many small shops are preparing to sell salt in one-yuan packages according to the official price limit. According to shop owners, if there is no effective rationing method for salt, the lines of citizens waiting to buy salt in front of salt shops may be even longer than the lines for buying sugar, because salt is an absolute necessity for every household, while sugar can be regarded as a semi-luxury item. As economic experts predicted, a man-made shortage of salt occurred after the per capita salt distribution was announced on Sunday. This was caused by salt merchants taking the opportunity to hoard and the anxiety of small citizens who feared a salt shortage, leading to a rush to buy.

Salt Shops and Restaurants Registering

At the same time, all salt shops and restaurants in the city registered yesterday in order to receive the salt to be allocated on December 1st. Two application forms must be filled out during registration, one guaranteeing that the shop owner is a genuine merchant and the other detailing the monthly sales or consumption of salt. It is heard that the distribution of salt will be implemented according to the Baojia area, calculating the total number of residents in each Baojia area and distributing salt at a rate of 0.5 kg or 17 ounces per capita. Salt shops in each area will receive salt in proportion to their past sales volume to meet the needs of the residents in that Baojia area and avoid the phenomenon of queuing. Residents can only purchase salt at salt shops in their residential area. According to officials from the Public Works Bureau and the French Municipal Council, the per capita salt distribution plan was initiated by Chinese shops and has not been approved by the two bureaus.

Free Purchase of Salt Not Restricted

Twenty-First Century News Agency Shanghai reports that according to the person in charge of Yü Mao Official Salt Company, the distribution of salt in the two concessions will be based on the actual monthly sales volume of salt in each sub-salt shop (including breweries and soy sauce shops) and distributed within that area to ensure that the distribution of salt is equal. Therefore, the rumor that per capita salt distribution will be implemented next month is a misunderstanding. At the same time, private salt vendors are deliberately spreading rumors in an attempt to take the opportunity to raise prices and dump their products for profit, creating a tense situation. However, the city's salt reserves are sufficient, and the supply is abundant, so there is no need to implement per capita salt distribution. Citizens can still buy and use salt freely without restrictions.

### Anti-American Association Broadcast

The Shanghai Chinese National Anti-British and Anti-American Association, in order to continue its propaganda work against Britain and the United States, is scheduled to broadcast a lecture at the Shanghai Radio Station at 9:30 PM tonight (the 25th). The lecture will be hosted by the association's propaganda department. In addition to the lecture, there will be a description of the plot of the drama "Yijiang Zhou Weeping." All sectors are requested to tune in at that time.

### Lifting Restrictions on Transportation of Agricultural Products in North China

Coal and Salt in Surplus

According to the English "Shanghai Times," Chang Zhou of North China lifted restrictions on the transportation of agricultural products from the three provinces of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan, as well as the three cities of Beijing, Tianjin, and Qingdao, on the 5th of this month. The authorities took this measure to adjust the supply and demand of agricultural products. Before the lifting order was issued, the prices of agricultural products in various parts of North China were rising sharply. Beijing millet was as high as 70 yuan (joint currency) per load, corn was 44 yuan, sorghum was 39 yuan, and soybeans were 60 yuan. In addition, coal and salt were in surplus. The official price of coal was 32 yuan per ton, and salt was sold for 16.9 cents per kilogram.

### Passengers Entering the South City by Vehicle Through the Iron Gate Should be Subject to Inspection at Any Time

Since rickshaws and vehicles in the concessions have been able to directly enter the South City, the traffic between the South City and the concessions has become more convenient. Passengers do not need to get off the vehicles and bypass when passing through the iron gate. In order to ensure the security and stability of the South City, the Municipal Police Headquarters has ordered the three police stations of the South City and the Yimiao to pay attention to the passengers on the vehicles at any time when the rickshaws pass through the iron gate of the French Concession to enter the South City. If there is anything suspicious, they should order them to get off the vehicle and search them thoroughly. They must implement this and not make mistakes.

### Oil Shops Exceeding Price Limits in Disguise

Forcing Bundling Sales of Soy Sauce and Salt is Illegal; Report It

Recently, although the edible oil wholesalers have actively adjusted the supply situation for the serious edible oil situation, it does not seem to be stabilizing. The retail situation is still congested, and there has been no relaxation to date. The price gouging events by various oil shops in the city continue to occur, especially in the Nanshi district. Oil shops in Houjiabang Road and Fangbang Road in the district are using the excuse that they have to bundle sales of soy sauce or salt in order to buy half a catty of oil, otherwise they refuse to sell. The quantity of soy sauce and salt is reduced by more than half compared to the past. According to the person in charge of the edible oil wholesalers, this disguised price increase and forced bundling of soy sauce and salt is illegal. It is hoped that citizens in the city will cooperate closely with the wholesalers and report any such incidents to the wholesalers for joint suppression.

Business News

### Public Bonds Struggle to Recover

The public bond gray market still showed no signs of recovery yesterday. Selling by the financial sector seemed to be nearing its end, but public confidence remained uninspired. The tightness of credit was evident. The environment seemed to have eased slightly, but heavy selling pressure in the market indicated that public sentiment was still surrounded by uncertainty. Yesterday's news of the reorganization of the Securities Exchange further weakened public confidence, causing instability in the bond market. Yesterday, Class C bonds opened at 57 yuan, reaching a high of 7.6 jiao, but due to persistent selling pressure, they retreated back to 7 yuan and even dipped to 6 yuan, with a low price of 55.8 jiao. The final price was 6.8 jiao. Class A bonds reached a high of 5.5 jiao and closed at 4.5 jiao. Class B bonds were at 53.5 jiao, with a low price of 2.8 jiao and a final price of 3 jiao. Class D bonds were at 2.5 jiao, with a low price of 1.2 jiao and a final price of 1.6 jiao. Class E bonds reached a high of 3.8 jiao, with a low price of 2.5 jiao and a final price of 2.8 jiao. All bonds continued to fall by 1.3 to 4 jiao, with Class A bonds falling the most, by 3.5 jiao. Trading volume was approximately 2.2 million yuan.

### Public Utility Stocks Surprisingly Lead the Way

Yesterday's market situation for Chinese merchant stocks saw a decline followed by a slight rebound around 11 o'clock. This was likely due to excessive declines in recent days, combined with rumors of interventions, which created a psychological effect. However, public sentiment remained unsettled. Ultimately, all stock prices declined uniformly, even the public utility sector, which had uniquely bucked the trend the day before, saw a retreat and took the lead in the decline. Zhabei Water & Electricity fell from 51.5 yuan to a low of 49.5 yuan, eventually closing at 50 yuan, a slight recovery of 2 yuan. Regardless of the state of the water and electricity industry itself, there has been no dividend distribution to shareholders, so a little benefit may be expected to alleviate their hunger and thirst. Even if this isn't the case, half a loaf is better than none. In reality, this is still wishful thinking on the part of stockholders. Huadian's share capital is of little significance, merely following Zhabei's lead. Yesterday, it also fell to around 35 yuan, down by 5 jiao. Great China Match once fell to 289 yuan, eventually closing at 292.5 yuan, up by 2.5 yuan. Pufoyang Tobacco also fell slightly by 5 yuan to 105-6 yuan. Cultural industries like Commercial Press and Zhonghua, suffering from oversupply, fell by 10 yuan. Department stores also experienced significant declines, with National Goods Company falling below 120 yuan, down by 5 yuan. Wing On and Sincere Company both fell by 2.5 yuan. Underwear and Kelly Department Store prices were more stable. In the textile industry, Wing On Textile fell to 1735 yuan, down by 40 yuan. Wuhe Weaving rose to 240 yuan with trading activity. Great China Weaving, with small denomination shares, once fell to 9 yuan, later recovering to 9.75 yuan with buyers, a rebound of half a yuan. Shanghai Cotton Weaving rose by 5 jiao to 12 yuan. Hongsheng, Daguangming, Yiyuan, Ningbo, and Fourth Weaving remained sluggish. New pharmaceutical stocks fluctuated, with Xin Ya closing at 50 yuan, Zhongfa at 98 yuan, and Minyi at 85 yuan, down by 1 to 3 yuan. Sino-French also fell to 455 yuan. Financial stocks, which have long suffered from high demand and low supply, saw some activity, with Guohua Bank at 155 yuan, Zhongnan at 260 yuan, and Kangyuan Canned Goods falling by another yuan, closing at 51 yuan. Considering the premium shares, it is only one yuan higher, indicating a general lack of interest among investors. Transaction days are rare. Today's report is listed below.

### Ornamental Gold Prices Remain Stagnant

Yesterday, in the gold jewelry market of Shanghai, Da Xin and other jewelers continued to post a selling price of 2,750 yuan per tael (with a reduction of approximately 300 yuan for buying in). There was no official market activity, with prices remaining between 2,660 and 80 yuan, the same as the previous day. Trading was sparse. The price of ornamental silver remained at 14 yuan per tael, with inter-dealer trading at 13.35 yuan, a slight increase. Yesterday's overnight loan interest rate from the Money Trade Association was 1.4 jiao, with no change.

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw stable Japanese military scrip. The inter-dealer price remained between 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 5 fen, 4 li and 6 li. Banks and small money shops quoted buying and selling prices of 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 9 fen and 6 jiao.

### New Foreign Silver Dollars and Ingots Still Face Difficult Sales

Yesterday's market remained quiet and inactive. Market activity relied solely on sporadic buying and selling by speculators. Wholesale transactions were insignificant. Merchants had long ceased dealing in various types of new foreign silver dollars and ingots, and street sales were also sluggish. While dealers holding inventory may have been encouraged by low stock levels in Shanghai, they ultimately found it difficult to achieve brisk sales. The market remained stagnant. Yesterday, new foreign silver dollars, new foreign ingots, and new foreign bricks were all priced at 12,000 yuan per ton, with higher prices for mixed types. New triangular iron was quoted at 16,000 yuan per ton, and 40-foot cement steel bars were priced at 10,000 yuan per ton. Foreign silver dollars, ingots, and triangular iron heads were all priced above 10,000 yuan per ton, with higher prices for mixed types.

### Common Bitter Apricots Relatively Cheap

Common bitter apricots were not strongly held by dealers. Several dozen packages were offered yesterday, in relatively dry condition but with some wormholes. The price for red-skinned goods was 500 yuan per batch, a relatively loose price. However, this was due to the lower quality of the goods, not a general price decline.

### Business Briefs

Orchid and Bamboo Branches Continue to Ease: Due to reduced actual sales of orchid and bamboo branches, dealers are eager to sell off their stock quickly, leading to a repeated devaluation and softening prices. Recently, wholesale prices have eased by 10 to 20 yuan. However, prices are still not high, and operating at the quoted price is unlikely to be profitable. Therefore, a rebound in the market is expected in the future.

Black Pepper Weak and Listless: Black pepper has seen little trading recently, leading to a soft and weak market. Wholesale prices have broken the 900 yuan mark. Stockholders are not interested and even intend to sell, causing the market to be listless. Currently, the market price is just above 900 yuan, but there are few buyers, suggesting little hope for improvement in the short term.

High-Quality Red Yeast Rice Becoming Scarce: The source of red yeast rice is gradually drying up, and high-quality goods in the market are even scarcer. Recently, internal medicine and pharmaceutical companies have primarily required high-quality products, so the market for good, thoroughly colored goods is becoming increasingly tight. Current market sales prices have risen by 100 to 200 yuan.

Daily Necessities Market Steadily Firm: Soap and candles are experiencing the most active sales, with rising prices reaching a boiling point. This is due to strong demand from various sources, causing holders of goods to refuse to release them. Firm Brand soap is as high as 420 yuan, Bai Xiangmao soap is 380 yuan, Huang Xiangmao soap is 320 yuan, and Arrow Knife soap is 390 yuan, a sharp increase of 20 to 30 yuan. White Li's Ship Brand candles are 310 yuan, Monk's Hat Brand are 260 yuan, and miscellaneous brands are 210 yuan, all up by about 10 yuan. Matches are also soaring, with Beauty Brand at 2700 yuan, Phoenix Spleen at 2600 yuan, Golden Tripod Brand at 2250 yuan, and miscellaneous brands at 2000 yuan. The trend in pharmaceuticals remains healthy, with Headache Powder trading at 26.5 yuan, Wan Jin You at 28 yuan, Bagua Dan at 24 yuan, Partridge Vegetable at 56.5 yuan, Longhu Ren Dan at 22 yuan, and Invincible Tooth Powder at 10 yuan, all of which have risen compared to previous prices.

Miscellaneous Grains Trading Remains Light: Yesterday's market was mixed, with slight fluctuations. Ten packages of selected green Wu Jiang were traded at 285 yuan, 20 packages of Chongming red sand were priced at 262 yuan, and 30 packages of sand silkworms were priced at 210 yuan. Forty packages of Qingdao sweet potato dried were priced at 190 yuan, and a truckload of Yuanlong soybean cake was priced at 67 yuan.

### Roar, China! Will Return to the Stage

— Bai Di

The name "Roar, China!" is exciting enough. It's a vivid script. I remember seven years ago, it caused a sensation when it was performed in Shanghai. Because the content of the script was full of anti-imperialist and anti-aggression sentiments, it was banned by the authorities of the Public Concession at the time. Later, through various channels, it was finally performed at the old Gong Wu Stage in the French Concession. Ying Yunwei was the director, and Yuan Muzhi and Chen Boer took the lead roles. The result was excellent and fulfilling. It left a deep and moving impression on Chinese audiences.

Now, according to the reporter's inquiry, this "Roar, China!" script, which has been absent for seven years, will be performed at the Grand Theatre starting on the 8th of next month. It is said that the organizer is the Anti-British and American Association of the Chinese Nation. After much consideration, the name of the play has been changed to "The Blood-Stained Record of Jiang Zhou." The main actors are mostly first-class actors from the film and drama circles. Li Lihua and Shi Hui also play important roles in the play. The director has been decided to be Li Pingqian and Tu Guangkai. According to various reports, in addition to the performance of "The Blood-Stained Record of Jiang Zhou," there will also be guest performances by female stars and singers. Everyone has already started rehearsing the script. It is expected that it may meet the audience in the near future.

The script of "Roar, China!" was previously translated by Pan Zienong. The emotions are vivid, and the scenes are magnificent. We are looking forward to its return to the stage. This is not only a surprising performance in Shanghai's drama scene in the past year, but also a total assembly of film and drama personnel of an epoch-making era!

Roar, China! I wish it a promising reunion.

### Thoughts on "Between Men and Women"

— Ye

"Between Men and Women" is a comedy.

The realism of the subject matter and the intimacy of the portrayal have made "Between Men and Women" an unexpected success. The playwright uses the contradictions of human psychology and the unsoundness of thought to create a lot of jokes. The insertion of these jokes is so natural and intimate. Although the script lacks a strong storyline, making it seem not to be a great comedy, the playwright's expression of his script is completely focused on sketching and quick writing, so I think its simplicity and authenticity are the valuable aspects of the script.

Directing a comedy is a thankless job, especially this kind of comedy, because the director has no way to use the actors' position movements, exaggerated actions, or the intricate relationships of the story to create a climax. I think Mao Yu's success lies in the appropriate placement of the actors, which makes people feel beautiful, the so-called beauty of movement.

Perhaps a director's task is not limited to arranging positions, and at the same time, the arrangement of positions is often overlooked by the audience. Therefore, directors usually pay attention to static scenes. But once the actors move, it makes people feel stiff and the scenes lack connection. "Between Men and Women" does not have these shortcomings.

The end of the play is too bland and lacks a climax, or at least it lacks power. This is the only flaw, and it is a responsibility that the playwright and director should share together.

Regarding the actors, I think they are all very good, but they lack some real emotion. Naturally, this is a very general statement. Due to space limitations, my words will end here.

### A Comprehensive Look at "Clouds and Rainbows"

— Luo Lü

Looking at the cast list of "Clouds and Rainbows," a long line gathers the elite of the art world, which is rare in the recent drama scene. In terms of its lineup, it can be said to be strong enough. In terms of plot, it is naturally too far from the facts. The author has already "confessed" this in the statement, but some places feel that they are too far removed from the facts. The "singing opera after being poisoned" in the last scene is an example. After being poisoned, a person will sing opera loudly on the ground, which seems inappropriate. The last scene was originally a very tense and tragic scene, but it was "hummed with Beijing tunes," which relaxed the tense atmosphere, and a climax turned into blandness.

The most successful performance of the entire play of "Clouds and Rainbows" is Yi Fang, who plays the qin player Wang Jingfu. From his appearance in the second act to the end of the last act, the audience felt that every movement in the second act was very appropriate, and he was able to grasp the personality of the characters in the play everywhere.

Jiang Daliu, who plays the heroine Yun Caixia, cannot be said to be very successful, but she has not failed. Except for some hoarseness in her throat, which affected her reputation as a "famous actress," there seems to be no "flaw" to be found in her.

Xin'ai Wang Taiji, the male lead, is a difficult and unrewarding role. Although he is very handsome, he has not yet grasped the personality of the characters in the play. His lines sound like storytelling. In the second act, when he arrives at the Chen family and tells everyone about the situation in Beijing, he walks to the side of the road and then to the other side, which is too rigid and makes people uncomfortable. When Yun Caixia dies beside him in the last scene, he does not show enough emotion.

To sum up, although there are a few places in this play "Clouds and Rainbows" that are not perfect, the overall performance does not disappoint. Following the "Great Circus" of Shangyi, it is a play worth watching, and I recommend this "Clouds and Rainbows" to everyone.

### Accidentally Saw Two Good Plays (Part Two)

— Su Shaoqing

Dewe's performance of Gao Chong in "Picking the Halberd Cart" has several points that are different from others. When picking Wu Zhutu's big earrings with his spear, others pick them while standing, but Dewe rushes up and picks them while his legs are suspended in the air. This fierce strength of his truly has the power of Mount Tai pressing down. Also, when he is fighting the Jin Kingdom Hammer General, he hits like the wind sweeping fallen leaves. Suddenly, he knocks the Hammer General down, and he quickly strikes a golden rooster standing on one leg, and the crooked stance is fast and stable, comparable to Shang Heyu's crooked stance in Iron Cage Mountain. I have never liked to shout "Bravo," but at this time, I couldn't help but break the rule and shout "Bravo." Perhaps he knew that I wanted to see Shang's crooked stance, and today he saw me in the audience, so he deliberately "took the risk" and used twelve points of strength to show this move to let me see. This is me putting powder on my own face. I don't know if I guessed right or not, but since I have seen this good stance of his today, I am very satisfied even if I don't see Iron Cage Mountain.

Li Duokui's "Walking and Teaching His Son" Duokui's old woman opera, I haven't heard for more than ten years. Now he is like the last flame of the Lu Temple, and I want to listen to him well once. Today, after Fu Dewei's "Picking the Halberd Cart" is finished, it is his "Walking and Teaching His Son." This play is not an important one for the old woman, so I can't say that I have good fortune today, but when he raises his voice and sings several high and long old woman arias, people can't help but say "Bravo." After all, he is an old master, and he always has some real skills. He is not just getting a false reputation by fooling the world. It is a pity that he is old and his white mouth and words cannot be very clear.

Below is Li Yuzhi's "Nengren Temple," and the main show is Li Zongyi's "Losing Jie Ting and Executing Ma Su." I saw the completion of the two sixes on the city tower, and it was already late, so I left and went home. I think Li Zongyi is young and strong, and it is more suitable for him to play the plays of black-bearded people, such as "Catching and Releasing Cao." If he plays this play of Zhuge Liang, which requires little food and much work, and it is also a big living show of the Zheng Pi school, I always feel that it is a little lacking. To save space, I will not go into details.

### Drama Stage Spring and Autumn

— Wei Ren

Following "Red Star Tears," "Zhongzhong" staged "Desire Demon," with Sun Jinglu playing Hua Yueying, another bold and unrestrained style. Chou Quan's role is also very important. This play is a competition of acting skills for the actors and is worth watching.

"New Zhong" has begun rehearsing Qiu Hao's "Autumn Boudoir Complaint," with Gu Han still taking the lead.

The performance of "The Grudge of the Qing Palace" may be problematic. "Yiguang" is currently rushing to rehearse "Sweet Sister," with a wonderful performance by Huang Zongying.

Li Qinian has canceled his plan to go to Paris to perform and is rumored to be going to Nanjing to perform in the next few days.

Lu Ming is scheduled to leave for Tianjin and Beijing at the end of the month to perform.

Yao Ke has resigned as the manager of the Lyceum Theatre, and Ma Jiang will succeed him.

### Sharing the Same Boat Through Storms

— Xiang Jia Zhi

One One - The Qiu Family

Wei Cheng walked with the old man and his son of the Qiu family for another distance, then they parted ways. After walking dozens of steps forward, Wei Cheng sat down on an anthill by the roadside, and Huang Long also squatted down, took out a cigarette, and the two smoked. Wei Cheng said, "Listening to what the old man said, we don't need to go to Ant Hill Town anymore. So, there are many roads that we plan to take, but in the end, we don't need to take them. Conversely, some people want to walk a few steps, but in the end, they walk more." Huang Long said, "If we don't go to Ant Hill Town, we will go to Double Bridge Town." Wei Cheng said, "Yes, when we get there, you don't have to open your mouth too much. I am always worried about you. And only tell three points of the truth to people. You don't have to call me Wei Cheng, and I don't have to call you Huang Long, just in case." Huang Long laughed and looked at the ground and said, "If you say that, you should slap yourself in the face. In that small tea house like a cold kiln, didn't you call me Huang Long, which made that guy who looked like the boss think that I was Huang Long who runs a tea house in Guanyintang?" Wei Cheng also laughed and said, "In that case, telling the truth also has its benefits. Saying Ant Hill Town saved us from going to Ant Hill Town."

The two stood up, and Huang Long pointed and said, "To go to Double Bridge, we should go south from here. I am much more familiar with this than you." On the road, Wei Cheng said, "He Bing is probably a sinister and treacherous person. He would set fire to his own house and burn two people to death." Huang Long said, "That old guy didn't say that Cheng Bing set the fire himself." Wei Cheng laughed and said, "He didn't say it, but we can guess it, otherwise, it wouldn't be so bizarre." Huang Long was about to say something, when Wei Cheng bumped him on the shoulder, knowing that someone was following them. Huang Long walked fast, and before the setting sun went below the horizon, they arrived at Double Bridge Town. They had discussed on the road that as soon as they arrived at Double Bridge Town, they would first find an inn to rest, rest their feet, eat dinner, and then go to Old Mrs. Chen's house to ask a quick question. If Cheng Bing is really Old Mrs. Chen's son, no matter what, it will be revealed in his words and expressions. So, as soon as they arrived in town, Huang Long first asked a grocery store on the market, "Is there a Longxing Inn here?" This was actually made up by Huang Long. The store clerk said, "There is no Longxing Inn. The only inn in this town is the Wang Shundian Inn, which is the first one and the biggest one. (238)
