### Soviet Forces, Blessed by the Timing of the Heavens, Firmly Defend Stalingrad; Both Sides Engage in Artillery Battles Across the Volga River

Lisbon, 2nd, Allied News Agency

German forces breaking into the Stalingrad area number as many as 35,000, now concentrated in the northwest area conducting siege street fighting, and attacking factory zones, progressing steadily, occupying buildings in turn, and actively building fortifications based on the buildings, tightening the siege of the city. Soviet troops have laid obstacles on various roads in an attempt to stop German tanks from advancing, but they have all been destroyed by German artillery fire. The German army is also using flares and illumination bombs for surprise attacks, and on the night of the 2nd, continued to occupy three large buildings to use as forward bases.

A certain place on the Soviet border, 2nd, Havas News Agency

Today is the 467th day of the German-Soviet war. There have been no major changes in the Eastern Front, especially around Stalingrad. Although the Axis forces continue to advance, because the German commander-in-chief is trying to reduce casualties, progress is very slow. At present, the German army is fiercely attacking Red Army positions in the industrial areas of Behachiv and Lykov. The Lykov area was originally a workers' residential area, and the Red Army has transformed the workers' residences into fortresses, equipped with heavy artillery and mortars, and laid mines, all heavily guarded. The supply of food and ammunition is continuously transported from the Volga River. Although it has been heavily bombed by German aircraft, it is still transported by small boats at night. The strategy adopted by the German army is still mainly aerial bombardment. Once the important positions of the Red Army are destroyed, suicide grenade squads, engineers, and infantry are dispatched in each battle, so they do not directly participate. Judging from this, the German General Headquarters does not intend to attack head-on, but wants to wait for the Red Army to become exhausted. At present, the defense of Stalingrad is entirely undertaken by the elite troops of the Soviet secret police. The German army must be particularly cautious when occupying each building to prevent landmines and electrocution inside. In the past, the German army was unaware and repeatedly fell into the Red Army's trap, suffering heavy casualties, so now they must be especially cautious. Even in the German-occupied area, there are still Soviet guerrillas. The German army is engaged in mopping-up operations to eliminate the remaining enemies, and must also pay a great price. The Red Army is currently using underground passages to appear behind German lines from time to time. In addition, a major feature of the battle for Stalingrad is the intense artillery battles on both sides. The artillery teams on both sides fire at each other across the Volga River. The German heavy artillery team is located on the right bank of the Volga River, constantly bombarding the Soviet artillery positions on the left bank. The German air force is also constantly bombing the Soviet artillery teams. Outside the Stalingrad area, the German army is still on the defensive. Their position has recently benefited from the heavy rain and muddy roads, which can be said to be blessed by the timing of the heavens.

### The Current Pacific War Situation is Advantageous to Japan; Colonel Hirade Delivers a Speech

Tokyo, 3rd, Allied News Agency

Colonel Hirade, spokesman for the Japanese Imperial Headquarters Navy Press Department, stated tonight at the Soldiers' Zen Rationality Rally held at the Hibiya Public Hall that the United States dispatched troops to the Solomon Islands in an attempt to use Australia as a base for a counterattack against Japan, which happened to suit Japan's plan and put Japan in a strategically advantageous position. The United States' desire to make the Australian coast a base for counterattack has become increasingly apparent recently. President Roosevelt even said yesterday that Japan should be destroyed first, and then a second front should be established in Europe. Another reason why the United States is eager to protect Australia is that it hopes to inherit Australia, Britain's largest legacy, after Britain collapses. Although the United States suffered setbacks in the First and Second Solomon Sea Battles, it still does not abandon the Solomon Islands, which shows its eagerness to rescue Australia for its own sake. He was not at liberty to disclose the details of the ongoing battles in the area, but it can be explained that the US troop deployments and landings on the islands in that area only serve to tire the Japanese and prolong America's need to continue sending troops, since the American forces there must have a continuous supply of food and munitions. It is worth noting what kind of transportation and what kind of fleet the US will use to supply the stranded troops. Since Japan wants to quickly destroy the enemy, nothing pleases it more than the enemy's arrival. However, Japan would rather gradually implement tactics in the Solomon Islands, because rapid action would immediately lose the valuable bait. Now, this bait will be retained for as long as necessary, according to the necessary procedures, and will be annihilated when it can no longer lure the enemy. As for the details of the destruction of several enemy aircraft carriers, transport ships, and more than ten other ships, it will be announced after the enemy forces are annihilated.

### Fierce Fighting on the Egyptian Front; Rommel Visits the F√ºhrer to Report on the Situation in North Africa

Turkish Capital, 3rd, Allied News Agency

According to a report from Cairo, on Wednesday and Thursday, Axis and British forces engaged in fierce short-range combat outside the edge of the Monaqib Depression on the Egyptian front. The Axis forces launched a fierce counterattack. First, British infantry attacked the German left flank, followed by heavy shelling by British artillery. However, the Axis artillery fire was also fierce, and British first aid posts were often under mortar and machine gun fire. The German army still firmly held the line running through the center of the depression, which was about 1,000 yards long, and infantry battles also broke out in the southern auxiliary position held by the German army. According to official announcements from Berlin and Rome two days ago, the British offensive against the Axis positions in Egypt has been severely damaged and retreated.

The results of the negotiations have not yet been announced. Several months ago, Germany proposed a method for exchanging wounded prisoners of war, but at that time, the agreement could not be implemented because the United Kingdom failed to fulfill certain agreements on the simultaneous exchange of imprisoned overseas Chinese. As for whether the exchange of imprisoned overseas Chinese is also included in this negotiation, the official did not mention it.

### Roosevelt Returns to the White House Quickly and Convenes a Military Meeting; This Secret Tour of the Country is Intended to Revive War Efforts

Argentine Capital, 2nd, Allied News Agency

According to a report from Washington, Roosevelt convened Chief of Staff Marshall and Chief of Naval Operations and Commander of the Joint Fleet Admiral King on the 2nd to hold important discussions, and then held similar discussions with Secretary of War Stimson. This was Roosevelt's first meeting with the highest military leaders after returning from a two-week inspection tour. It is said that this meeting was to listen to the situation of the battles and other matters during the two weeks of his absence. However, it is worth noting that Roosevelt is advocating strengthening operations against Germany, and the US military department's opinion that defeating Japan is the top priority has not been consistent. It can be seen that the relationship of this meeting is subtle.

Washington, 2nd, Havas News Agency

It was officially announced that President Roosevelt's tour of the country lasted two weeks and he returned to the White House today. The President's trip was of a secret nature and was not publicly announced until today. It is said that he has inspected various land, sea, and air bases and major factories throughout the country. The President departed from Washington on the 17th of last month, traveling 14,000 miles through Michigan, Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota, North Dakota, Montana, Idaho, and Washington, and went to the west coast, then turned to Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and North Carolina. Along the way, he spent the night in the car. Among them, the inspection of Ford factories, Chrysler factories, and Kaiser and Hitchins naval shipyards was the most notable. After the process of the President's trip was announced, 35 news reporters approved by the White House jointly wrote a letter to White House Secretary O'Malley to protest the secrecy of the President's trip. The letter pointed out the impropriety of allowing only a few reporters to follow the President on this trip, and stated that millions of people were able to see the President's face, but newspapers were not allowed to obtain any news of this trip, which was a huge mistake that could undermine the people's confidence in official information. The New York Times editorial today also expressed the same sentiment as the reporters, saying that 30 million Americans witnessed the President's trip, while the remaining 100 million compatriots were kept in the dark. People in the army and navy are praising the President, saying that this trip will boost the country's war effort. People in the political world believe that the congressional elections will be held in half a year and that the President's trip may be for campaign purposes, so they are expressing displeasure. The Republican Party pointed out that recent opinion polls and the results of the Maine election prove that Americans support the Republican Party, and that President Roosevelt may be trying to change the political trends in the states by personally coming forward. Criticisms in Congress of the President's actions have led some observers to believe that the state of opposition between the country and the President will soon become more acute. Criticisms of the current censorship methods and dissatisfaction with the President's secretive trip are becoming a common phenomenon. Most radio commentators say that when the President leaves the White House, precautionary measures should be taken, which is well known, but since millions of people have seen the President, it can be seen that the trip has not been kept secret from those who want to obstruct it. So, aren't the above-mentioned cautious measures redundant? In short, although absolute silence has been maintained in the news, the American public is now asking itself whether American radio stations and newspapers can be trusted in this situation in the future.

### Willkie Holds Important Talks in Chongqing

Nanjing, 2nd, Allied News Agency

According to a Chongqing report tonight, US President Roosevelt's special envoy Willkie met with General Chiang Kai-shek and Kung Hsiang-hsi and others for a moment yesterday. People in Chongqing are speculating about the nature of the suggestions Willkie brought on this trip. Political observers believe that it is nothing more than the following four points: (1) Opening up a new international supply route through India and increasing the current air routes (2) Strengthening British and American air force cooperation in Chongqing (3) Dispatching more experts and technicians to Chongqing (4) The United States and Chongqing jointly mediate the Indian issue

Saigon, 3rd, Kaitong News Agency

Since Willkie has arrived in Chongqing, the authorities are doing their best to take care of this American guest. Willkie lives in a refined two-story house. The equipment is rich and is the crown of the whole city. The bathroom is all built with white tiles. The house is decorated with Chinese-style ancient decorations. The bedding on the bed is all made of top-grade Shu brocade. The authorities also prepared American cigarettes, American beer, and various expensive foreign wines for Willkie, and hired a waiter who can speak English to serve him. Willkie's cook used to work in Shanghai and can make dishes from twelve countries. The breakfast every morning is the best ham, fresh eggs, and grapes. There are fresh flowers in the house, and you can smell the fragrance as soon as you enter the house. In short, the Chongqing authorities have been extremely thoughtful, and have done their best to make this special envoy of President Roosevelt feel at home after arriving in Chongqing.

Saigon, 3rd, Kaitong News Agency

After arriving in Chongqing at 3:43 pm yesterday, Willkie told representatives of the press that the plane he was on encountered a Japanese destroyer en route, which caused a delay, but the Japanese plane did not attack the plane. According to Chongqing inspection authorities, hours before Willkie safely arrived in Chongqing, they strictly prohibited reporting his whereabouts.

### The Norwegian Newspaper Rehashes Old News; Hess's Flight to England - Germany Originally Wanted to Ally with England Against the Soviet Union

Swedish Capital, 2nd, Havas News Agency

The Dagbladet, a major newspaper in the Norwegian capital with good relations with Germany, suddenly published an article today explaining the mystery of German Deputy F√ºhrer Hess's sudden visit to England on May 10 last year. It stated that since Hess began his political career, he had an ambition to create an alliance between Germany, England, and the United States. He firmly believed that this alliance would be an excellent guarantee for establishing universal peace. Even the German F√ºhrer himself had made various efforts to reach an agreement with England, but after the Munich Pact was established, Prime Minister Chamberlain returned home and submitted an unprecedentedly large military budget to both houses of Parliament. England's refusal to join hands with F√ºhrer Hitler could be clearly seen from this. This was a painful blow to the F√ºhrer, but it is difficult to say whether F√ºhrer Hitler immediately abandoned the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãforming an alliance with England. Hess's resolute flight to England this time was mainly for this reason. He initially thought that he was going to England as a representative of F√ºhrer Hitler. After his mission was completed, he would be able to return freely and would not be detained by England as a prisoner. The British leaders would not sell out the secret of Hess's trip. The plan that Hess carried was roughly as follows: (1) England and the Axis powers conclude an alliance so that they can launch a common anti-Soviet struggle. Once the Soviet Union is defeated, its territory will be divided among several countries, but at the same time, they will all enjoy national independence. (2) Germany should have the right to rule over the oil-producing states of Ukraine and the Caucasus. (3) Guarantee that England will still retain all its mandated territories in the Near East. (4) All the colonies that Germany owned before the last war should be returned to Germany. Under the above-mentioned conditions, Germany is prepared to guarantee the British Empire in accordance with the wishes of the British government. Also, Hess has many friends in England and is eloquent and is the best negotiator. Only this person can make suggestions to England and can be expected that the other party will not leak the content to a third party. Also, the people who assisted him in leaving the country have all been arrested, so it was originally thought that it would not be difficult to keep the real reason for Hess's trip secret. It is known that Prime Minister Churchill, in addition to consulting with President Roosevelt, did not consult with others and made a historical decision, resolutely rejecting Hitler's suggestion. President Roosevelt was also strongly opposed to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa British-German alliance, fearing that the two countries would jointly use all their economic resources and organizational genius to endanger the United States in the future. At the same time, Churchill and Roosevelt also regarded Hess's plan as an exposure of Germany's weaknesses and believed that Germany would never dare to attack the Soviet Union alone. After the two decided to reject Germany's suggestion, Prime Minister Churchill telegraphed Stalin to urge him to pay attention to the fact that the Soviet Union was in danger of being attacked by Germany in the shortest possible time.

### Dakar May Be Attacked; The French Cabinet Studies Countermeasures; P√©tain Receives Laval and Darlan

Zurich, 3rd, Allied News Agency

According to a report from Lisbon, US Senator Mead's open encouragement in the Senate to occupy Dakar has aroused anger in all aspects of France. A Parisian newspaper said that if the United Nations attempts to occupy Dakar Island, France should jointly defend the place with Germany. According to a report from Paris, a local newspaper here on the 2nd discussed the crisis in Dakar, saying that based on the movements of various parties, the United States and Britain seem to be attempting to simultaneously attack Dakar and Casablanca and use West Africa as a base to invade North Africa. Therefore, the interests of French colonies and the interests of Europe can be said to be gradually becoming consistent.

Zurich, 3rd, Allied News Agency

According to a report from Vichy, the French government convened an emergency cabinet meeting on the 2nd, which was attended by all members, including Chairman P√©tain.

Vichy, 3rd, Kaitong News Agency

General P√©tain convened a cabinet meeting yesterday afternoon. Political circles here believe that this meeting is related to French West Africa Governor Puyasson's order to evacuate women and children from Dakar. The main topic is to discuss the French government's measures to protect its African colonies. Since a US Senator advocated that the United States and Brazil take joint action to occupy Dakar, the concern here is that the invasion of Dakar is imminent. According to unconfirmed reports, US troops and a large number of war equipment have not only arrived on the Gold Coast, but have also landed in Liberia and Sierra Leone. This news has increased France's worries.

Vichy, 3rd, Kaitong News Agency

General P√©tain received government leader Laval and Minister of National Defense Admiral Darlan today.

### Herriot Loses His Freedom

Vichy, 3rd, Kaitong News Agency

The official here announced that former Speaker of the French House of Representatives, Herriot, has not been arrested and sent to a concentration camp, but he is not allowed to leave his country villa. It is said that this measure is due to his attitude and remarks towards the French government.

Vichy, 2nd, Havas News Agency

Radical Party leader and former Prime Minister Herriot has been ordered to be under police surveillance at his residence in the Is√®re Province from the 1st of this month, and his freedom of movement will also be subject to certain restrictions. It is reported that Herriot is currently 70 years old. From the last world war to the current great war, he has occupied a very important position in French politics. He belongs to the Radical Socialist Party. When he first started his political career, he was elected as the mayor of Lyon. In 1915, he first participated in the government as a cabinet member. In 1924, he was ordered to form a cabinet. In 1926 and 1932, he served as Prime Minister twice. By 1940, he was elected as the Speaker of the House of Representatives. After the armistice, he retired to the forest until now.

### Warehouse Stockpiling Tax: National Legal Principle Accepted

Suggesting Three Measures

The silver and money industry, upon receiving orders to prevent hoarding and speculation to suppress commodity prices, and in accordance with the first category of profit-making business income of the Income Tax Regulations, regarding the income of temporary profit-making businesses, implementing stockpiling taxation, all firms with warehouses and godowns have accepted the principle. However, regarding the newly promulgated provisional measures for resident commissioners to collect temporary business income tax, all firms, warehouses, godowns, and various industries, after discussion, have made three suggestions to the Shanghai District Collection Bureau. The suggestions request a clear investigation to ensure that goods stockpiled by non-industry members are taxed according to law. If the goods are operated by legitimate shops, factories, and firms, they should not be considered hoarding and speculation. Furthermore, the Income Tax Regulations stipulate that the first category of profit-making business income includes companies, firms, godowns, factories, or individuals with capital exceeding 2,000 yuan, and their operating income is already subject to taxation. If goods stored in warehouses are taxed again, it would inevitably lead to double taxation. Whether there is any profit-making income from goods in warehouses and whether the legal profits of various industries' stored goods can be regulated requires actual investigation and decision to safeguard legitimate merchants' compliance with the law.

### New Head of the Public Works Department's Legal Department Takes Office

### Traffic Control Measures During Blackout Periods; Pedestrians Must Follow Designated Routes

The blackout drills took place on the 1st of this month from 7:03 PM to 9:05 PM, and on the 2nd from 7:10 PM to 9:30 PM. The start and end of the drills were broadcast by the Great Eastern Radio Station. However, an air raid siren was sounded on the 1st, but not on the 2nd. Yesterday was the third day of air raid control. After 9:00 PM, most of the Public Concession Self-Defense Corps were deployed to patrol. Ropes were used to cordon off some roads and sidewalks, directing pedestrians to walk along the sides, while vehicles were instructed to drive slowly in the center of the road before the restrictions were lifted after a short period.

Some Residents Have Been Warned

Following the promulgation of penalty regulations by the French Consulate yesterday, it has been learned that they have been implemented starting today. During the air raid drill last night, Lianbao chiefs, Baojia chiefs, and civil police officers patrolled and warned those who had not prepared blackout lampshades. If they do not comply, their power lines will be cut off and they will be fined.

Laozha Police Station Issues Guidelines

In order to provide a standard and uniform guide for the Baojia personnel in handling air raid blackout control, the Laozha Police Station has printed and distributed blackout control guidelines to the Baojia Self-Government Association of the district, which will then forward them to the Lianbao and Bao. The key points are summarized as follows: (1) Organization: (A) During blackout control, the Bao is the organizational unit, and all matters are directed by the Bao chief. (B) Each Bao must have the following organizations: (i) Self-Defense Corps, whose duties are as follows: (a) Maintaining traffic order, advising pedestrians to keep to the left, and prohibiting them from walking in the middle of the road. (b) Cracking down on criminal behavior. (ii) Patrol Team, whose duties are as follows: (a) Suppressing light leaking outdoors. (b) Paying attention to unexpected events.

The Industry Hopes to Eliminate the Black Market

It has been reported in the newspapers that the French Concession Price Assessment Committee announced to the French Concession Tobacco Dealers Association that various daily necessities must be sold in accordance with the first assessment price list, and those who exceed it will be punished. According to Xu Wenxiang, a member of the French Concession Tobacco Dealers Association, after receiving the notice from the French Concession Commodity Evaluation Committee, the industry immediately sold in accordance with the first approved assessment price list. However, due to cost considerations, many types of cigarettes could not actually be sold.

### To Maintain Public Health and Order, Strictly Manage Prostitution Businesses to Gradually Reduce Solicitation on the Streets

The Public Works Department's Information Office announced that in order to maintain public health and reduce the number of prostitutes soliciting on the streets and obstructing the public, the Department has decided to reimplement the licensing system for brothels and prostitutes (commonly known as "chick prostitutes") starting from November 1st.

### Exciting Football Match: Donghua vs. Menxi United Today at 4 PM at the Racecourse

The exciting Sino-Western football match was originally between Hualian and Xilian, but it has now been decided that Donghua will face Menxi United alone at 4 PM today at the Racecourse. The referee is Chen Jixiang. Menxi United gathers the elite of the Sanfangji, Beixi Children, and Portuguese teams, with a strong lineup of players such as Madali, Lieao, Hanibo, Fu Enjie, Mu Huat, Gainpan, Tuosun, and Edward. The strength of the attack at that time can be predicted. The team is still the original team that fought against Sanfangji. Goalkeeper Zhang Banglun is skilled and can be called a rising star. The defense of Zhuang Youren and Li Ning, a pair of old partners, will be able to defend against the enemy from thousands of miles away. The right side of the center defense line is weaker, but the full-court running of Han Longhai in the center will surely make up for this deficiency. The forwards Zhang Mingsheng, Jia Youliang, Zai Linjing, Liang Shutang, Yuan Kun, and Tian Hezuo have shown tacit understanding, and their sharp attack in the three matches against Sanfangji has made the enemy fearful. Tickets are still sold for five yuan.

### The Tortuous Trend of Chinese Stocks

Yesterday, the market situation of Chinese merchant stocks had already turned into a tortuous trend. On that day, the stocks first fell and then rose. Xinfeng Printing and Dyeing rose from 20.05 yuan to 24 yuan, which was not easy to buy. Moreover, Sanyou Industrial and Kangyuan Canning (80 yuan) both had favorable buying news, which aroused the interest of investors and caused the prices to rise and fall differently. In the future, without special changes, there may be upward progress next week, because as soon as the stock prices are slightly lower, there will be buyers absorbing them. Among the cultural stocks, the Zhonghua Book Company suddenly became a surprise and stood out at over 200 yuan. On that day, it rose to 205 yuan, which was the final transaction price, a rise of 9 yuan. Shijie also rose by 1 yuan to 64 yuan as the final price. Shangwu 193.5 yuan, Yongxiang Printing 24.5 yuan, and the slaughter was flattened for no reason. Among the department stores, only Wing On rose by 1.5 yuan to reach 24.5 yuan. Xinxin and Guohuo both returned to within 20 yuan, the former being 2 yuan lower at 119 yuan, and the latter being 0.5 yuan lower at 115 yuan.

### Public Bonds Advance Sharply but Retreat Quickly

The over-the-counter market for public bonds continued to decline. The market was slack and people's hearts were unstable. Large investors continued to sell. The sharp rise in late September was also a reaction to this situation. Moreover, at this time, there were many rumors and the market was nowhere near its due date. People felt more and more fearful. The trend of each of our bond markets showed that the 50 yuan mark was first broken by Ding type. For example, yesterday, Ding type had seen over 50 yuan, and then Bing type was slightly raised and rose again to 0.09 yuan. Bing type once broke 4 yuan, and Yi type broke 3 yuan. Each bond was only 0.7 to 1 yuan lower. Only Jia type 4 had a consecutive inverted offer, which was relatively stable. The teardrop Yi type was only 2.6 yuan, which was still 0.7 yuan less than Bing. Wu type was 1.4 yuan. The transaction volume was about 1.56 million yuan.

### Cotton Cloth Remains Stable as Before

Factory Cloth

Yesterday, the market was as stable as before. However, due to the Saturday relationship, there were very few transactions. 16-pound Earth coarse cloth still required 189 yuan, Flying Hong 18.9 yuan, 9-pound New Character 110.5 yuan, 8-pound Zhenzhong 107.5 yuan, 12-pound Earth fine cloth 162 yuan, Dapeng 158.5 yuan, Fugui 155 yuan, Fugui Bank single 151 yuan, Chick Shilin 244 yuan, Mermaid Yuan diagonal 138 yuan, Peach Blossom Lady Shilin 25 yuan started, the highest price sold was 254 yuan, and the afternoon close was 253.5 yuan, continuing to rise by 0.25 yuan.

Dong Cloth

The market atmosphere was stable, with Four Gentlemen Serge being traded more actively. The dealers continued to collect. The initial opening price was 6.99 yuan, rising to 7.05 yuan and then falling back to 6.98 yuan. Finally, due to more buyers than sellers, it rose again to 7.04 yuan at the close, a rise of 0.02 yuan. 12-pound Dragon Head Fine Cloth Shangxin single was 170 yuan, Bank single was 160 yuan, which fell by 0.5 yuan. Color Ball Fine Cloth was first tired and then rose, still selling for 159.75 yuan without much honor or disgrace.

### Japanese Military Tickets Remain Strong

Yesterday, the rumors about the Japanese military tickets in the foreign currency market had subsided, and the momentum continued to be strong. The interbank price was 5.5546 yuan, and the retail price at small money shops was 5.565 yuan, with a collection price of 5.5455 yuan, it was said.

Yesterday, the interbank interest rate of the Money Shops Association was still quoted at 0.14 yuan and had not changed. From September 21 to September 26, the number of bill exchanges by the Joint Preparatory Committee was 56,248, with a total amount of 540,228,374.82 yuan.

### Jewelry Gold and Silver Stabilize

Yesterday, the retail price of jewelry gold in the Dashin and Tonghang jewelry stores in the city was still listed at 2,350 yuan per tael (with a collection deduction of about 300 yuan). The interbank price fluctuated within a small range, with the morning price being 2,110 yuan, then 2,105 yuan, rising back to 2,120 yuan, and 2,115 yuan at noon, a rise of 5 yuan with a difference of 15 yuan. The transaction was light.

The retail price of jewelry patterned silver was still listed at 14 yuan per tael, and the interbank price was 11.56 yuan.

### Corn Sales Increase Frequently

Corn sales have frequently increased, but arrivals are still weak, causing the market to be quite volatile. Yesterday, the opening price of Wuhu corn for delivery in West Shanghai was 137 yuan per cart, and the price of 100 bags of Holland corn for delivery in South Shanghai was 135 yuan.

Due to the lack of arrival and active sales of red sorghum, the trend rose. Yesterday, the opening price of Mingguang red sorghum was 117 yuan per cart.

Due to the scarcity of both arrivals and sales of beans, yesterday the opening price of 10 bags of Wujiang Yuanging was 200 yuan.

### Shima New Longan

The damage from damage on the stack is extremely heavy

The first batch of new Shima longan has been transferred to the stack yesterday after going through customs clearance and other procedures. The goods are still dry and the color is very red and bright. However, the situation of the goods being stacked from the pier this time is extremely bad. Although the goods are in solid wooden boxes, the damage from damage is still extremely heavy. If this loss is added to the cost, the price will naturally increase accordingly. This should be given special attention.

### The Price of Dried Lily Flowers Gradually Stabilizes

Recently, shipments of assorted dried lily flowers have continued to arrive in the market. Although prices are high, they show signs of stabilizing. However, it is still difficult for production costs to decrease. Actual sales have not been robust, which is the main reason for the inability to continue price increases. Therefore, we must wait quietly for the development of actual sales before a tightening of supply becomes possible.

### Reflections After Reading "Letters From a Self-Made Merchant to His Son"

‚Äî Written by a Farmer

After reading Mr. Xu Baiyi's translation of "Letters From a Self-Made Merchant to His Son," I was deeply moved and had several reflections.

The advice in the letters to his college graduate son is truly insightful. Only someone as experienced as Mr. Graham can conceive of it. First, the work one does within working hours will not damage one's health; only what one does after work hours affects health. This is very true. I have a relative whose health has always been weak and lacks energy, like a sick person. If someone asks him why he is so listless, he always says he is unwell. However, he is not ill. You only need to see that after work, he cannot forget to gamble, gambling all night until dawn. Therefore, his energy is never good. This proves Mr. Graham's point.

Second, a twenty-two-year-old youth with a healthy body and mind should no longer rely on others for support. Therefore, I have notified my room, from July 15, stop your allowance. Mr. Graham stopped the allowance because he wanted his son to be self-reliant. Looking back at my relatives and friends, many are the sons of wealthy men with good education and health, but their fathers do not let them go into society, do not allow them to be independent, but only keep their sons at home as young masters, supplying them with extravagant allowances, only hoping that they can hold onto the family property in the future. This buries many young people with healthy bodies and minds and creates a batch of young masters and underachievers. How can society not be corrupt?

I hope that fathers, after seeing "Letters From a Self-Made Merchant to His Son," can take responsibility for educating their sons, using correct and worldly advice to teach them, and not completely place this responsibility on teachers.

### Family Health Guide: Food Nutrition Table Compiled by Dr. Hou Xiangchuan

‚Äî Written by Wen

Everyone hopes to prevent illness and maintain health, but there are many opinions on how to achieve this, and there is no consensus. In fact, as long as you pay considerable attention to the selection of daily foods, you will actually have great help in obtaining health. People only know that food can nourish life, but they often do not study its actual nutritional value in detail. As a result, certain foods that are most resistant to drying are often rarely eaten or even discarded, while unnecessary foods are considered nourishing and eaten in excess. This not only does not help health but can even lead to illness.

Therefore, the Shanghai YWCA specially held a nutrition and health exhibition. The general public deeply appreciated its profound significance and great value, and paid close attention to it. Dr. Hou Xiangchuan's works were particularly numerous at the exhibition. Dr. Hou is erudite and prolific, and has a very deep understanding of food nutrition. The table below was compiled by Dr. Hou, based on scientific principles and detailed instructions regarding which foods are rich in which vitamins and what diseases can occur in the human body if certain vitamins are lacking. It makes a great contribution to preventing illness and maintaining health. This publication is eager to publish it to provide readers with a reference for daily food choices, serving as a family health guide.

### Housewife's Notes

‚Äî Written by Xiao Ding

A method to prevent the cork of a glass bottle from being pushed into the bottle is to insert a hairpin horizontally near the top of the cork. Be careful not to crack the cork when inserting the needle. The direction of the needle should be perpendicular to the grain of the cork, so that the cork will not break easily after prolonged use.

Children's heads are often injured by hitting the corners of tables. A clever housewife can cut two triangular pieces of rubber from an old rubber tire, sew the two sides together with thread to form a triangular bag, then stuff some cotton into it and put it on the corner of the table, so that it will not be injured if it is hit.

When repairing furniture at home, hammering inadvertently increases the number of scars on the furniture. A simple and effective way to avoid this damage is to put a rubber ring with a hole in the center on the nail before hammering. Then hammer the nail into the wood. Even if you are careless, it will not damage the furniture.

Floating debris on liquids is usually removed with a spoon or shovel, which inevitably takes out useful liquid at the same time. If an old fine comb is modified, this shortcoming can be avoided. The modification method is very easy. Just nail a wooden handle to the back of the comb. If the shape of the comb is slightly changed, the effect will be even greater. If the comb is made of celluloid or rubber, first soak it in hot water and wait until it softens before changing it to a curved shape.

Old umbrellas are often discarded or sold cheaply, which is not worthwhile. It should be known that umbrella ribs are light and strong and can be opened and closed, which has many advantages. In large families and places with many residents, there is no place to put wet towels. In this case, umbrella ribs can be used to make towel racks. Hanging them on the ceiling does not take up much useful space. It is also very suitable to use them to dry socks, vests, and other small clothes. Housewives often feel that there are too many oil bottles and the like in the kitchen and there is no place to put them. Here is a simple way: use screws to fix the screw caps of the bottles tightly under the wooden frame. When you want to use a bottle, you only need to unscrew it with one hand. When not in use, screw it on. Each screw cap must be screwed with two screws to prevent rotation.

### Family Maxims

Illness enters through the mouth, so be careful what you eat; otherwise, the illness will be severe. Calamity comes out of the mouth, so guard what you say; otherwise, calamity will entangle you.

On one day of life, be a good person. In one day of living in the world, do a good deed. On one day of leisure, read a good book. In one day of dealing with people, say a good word.

### One Week's Home-Style Menu

‚Äî Ms. Hua Ying

Among the vegetables these days, there is one seasonal item on the market: shepherd's purse. At three jiao per two taels, it is certainly not cheap. In fact, there is nothing cheap for the head of the family. Fortunately, it does not have to stand alone; it often needs to cooperate with other things. So if you buy three or four taels of shepherd's purse and buy some shredded meat and stir-fry it together, it can also be made into two shallow bowls to get through two meals a day. If you want to enrich it, you might as well buy some tofu, add some tapioca flour, and make a bowl of shepherd's purse, shredded meat, and tofu soup. The taste is quite good. As for vegetarian dishes, such as shepherd's purse fried dried shreds, shepherd's purse braised tofu, shepherd's purse fried bamboo shoots, etc., shepherd's purse has a very fresh flavor, similar to yellow bean sprouts.

Monday

Shepherd's purse stir-fried with shredded meat, dried shrimp egg drop soup, green vegetables stir-fried with rice noodles, pickled radish shreds with sesame oil.

Tuesday

Curry beef slices, salted croaker braised tofu, stir-fried artemisia, pickled mustard greens with mung bean sprouts.

Wednesday

Thursday

Sweet potato and beef patties, sweet and sour yellow croaker, vegetarian oil tofu soup, bamboo shoots stir-fried with bean curd sheets.

Friday

Bamboo shoots stir-fried with shredded meat, dried shrimp braised tofu, green vegetable broth, fried dough sticks with yellow bean sprouts.

### Twelve Letters From a Self-Made Merchant to His Son

‚Äî Translated by Xu Baiyi

Mr. Graham's son had joined the company, so he could not escape the common ailment of young people: not concentrating on his work and even sending his love letter to a customer, which made Mr. Graham very embarrassed. Therefore, when he went on a trip, he had to write to his son immediately to tell him what he had done wrong and give him some valuable advice.

Letter Six

Confusing One Thing With Another

Dear Son,

Yesterday, because I had to catch the train, I didn't have time to tell you about a matter that weighed heavily on my mind. Mr. Donnerly of the Donnerly Catering Company came to my office yesterday with an uncontrollable smile on his fat face. Because a few days ago, he had written a letter to negotiate about the insufficient quantity of a certain shipment he received, he received a letter from the company, but inside it began with "My Dearest" followed by an invitation to go to the movies.

My situation at the time was imaginable. Therefore, I immediately called Mr. Milligan to question him about who was managing the company's letters and that writing personal letters during office hours was a major mistake. He stood there in front of me in a daze. As a result, I realized that you were the one who had caused this joke. Although I can explain that because you are new to the company, everything is unfamiliar, my inherent dignity had to be discounted.

I am not opposed to you writing letters to your girlfriend, but you must write them before six in the morning or after eight in the evening. All the time you spend during office hours is money. If you spend half an hour writing a letter, then the company should compensate for the work that could have been completed in that half hour.

Mr. Milligan said that you learn everything quickly and successfully, and that you can do great things when you can concentrate, but it is very difficult for you to concentrate. A person cannot draw his boundaries completely empty, nor can he treat his brain as a warehouse for everything. Only when he is fully focused can he produce perfect work, because doing things is like oil; it cannot be mixed with other substances.

Managing some stamps and millions of dollars in the company are not different in principle. The whole business management will not be easier. Many young people hope that I will give them some advice, but when I tell them, they think it is ordinary. In fact, a person who has the basic commercial morality is equal to having created the foundation for advancement. I believe that an employee who comes to the company in the morning like a patient and then acts like a tiger after office hours is the most hopeless mediocrity.

In fact, I don't want every employee to do more for the company and increase the company's revenue. What I think is important is their future. A person who is considerate of the company and takes a considerable price will have equal service, and he will definitely get a chance to be promoted.

The Donnerly negotiation was finally settled. Although I can swear that the quantity was definitely not lacking, I had to agree to his request. This cost the company sixty dollars, entirely because you confused the letters, which left me speechless. Every time I think of this, my whole body gets terribly hot.

Your loving father, Graham
