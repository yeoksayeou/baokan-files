### Unfolding the Shanghai Cultural Renaissance Movement

Shanghai was originally the cultural center of modern China. Its contributions to Chinese culture and politics were higher than those of Beijing. We, in studying modern Chinese cultural history and political history, simply cannot slightly neglect Shanghai's cultural achievements. However, since the Sino-Japanese Incident, this cultural city of Shanghai began to undergo a qualitative change. The cultural figures originally concentrated in Shanghai scattered one after another, and at the same time, Chinese culture, which was originally concentrated in large cities—especially Shanghai—became dispersed in secondary cities, changing from a central form to a scattered form. This is something that every person who cares about the fate of the nation cannot help but feel "angry and worried" about. Not to mention the distant past, even considering the situation in Shanghai's cultural circles in the year since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, it can be said that they have unfortunately fallen into a state of stagnation!

Culture is sufficient to fully express the degree of development of a country and society, and at the same time, it is even more sufficient to promote the advancement of the country and society, and even the entire human society. Therefore, the more developed a country's society, politics, and economy are, the more brilliant and dazzling its culture will be, and it will also be constantly active and advancing. Therefore, no prosperous country or wise government does not do its best to promote cultural work, because the development of cultural work can create an invisible potential force. On the surface, the effects manifested by cultural work may not be as obvious or rapid as those of political and economic work, but the effects of cultural work will invisibly create great power. This power can not only help the government implement all good policies that are suitable to the needs of the people, but also promote the political and economic development of the country and society to a higher stage, improve the spiritual and material lives of human society, and create the ideal pastoral of human vision and happiness. Therefore, any nation with cultural progress, even if it finds itself in an extremely difficult situation, will definitely be able to overcome all difficulties and ultimately achieve its own national development. We have read through Chinese and foreign history and can absolutely not find any opposing arguments! Especially in this great Greater East Asia War, only by allowing all the nations of Greater East Asia to fully express the progress of their own national cultures, and only by allowing the two advanced countries of China and Japan in East Asia to cooperate with each other to promote the advancement of the cultures of all the nations of Greater East Asia, raise the cultural standards of all nations, and give full play to the cultural strengths of all nations, can we implement Sun Yat-sen's Pan-Asianism and build a new order of co-existence, co-prosperity, equality and freedom for all the nations of Greater East Asia.

Then, can Shanghai's cultural circles, which have always held a very important position in the cultural history of China and the world, in this great new era, still sit idly by and watch Shanghai's culture continue to stagnate in this way, allowing all cultural undertakings to wither and fall like grass and trees swaying in the wind and snow? At the same time, from the perspective of the current authorities in Shanghai, they must have a full understanding of the importance of revitalizing Shanghai's culture. Moreover, since the Greater East Asia War, they have also expressed their sincere care for Shanghai's cultural circles and their past achievements from all aspects, and have also expressed their determination to assist people in Shanghai's cultural circles to strive to maintain and develop cultural undertakings from all aspects. In today's situation where the Greater East Asia War is progressing victoriously and the future of all the nations of Greater East Asia is showing unprecedented brilliance, we must thoroughly recognize the close relationship between the revitalization of Shanghai's culture and the complete victory of the Greater East Asia War. In particular, we must recognize that cultural stagnation and the lack of vigor in cultural undertakings will place the country and its people in an adverse situation of decline and decline, which is not only an extreme misfortune for China's national fortune, but also with a people who have lost their autonomy, spontaneity, and initiative, they will definitely not be able to effectively and powerfully assist their allies. On the contrary, they will become a burden to their allies in the future. Therefore, in addition to hoping that people of ambition in Shanghai's cultural circles will be encouraged, we also sincerely hope that the wise authorities in Shanghai will go a step further and make greater efforts to cultivate the culture of the Chinese people, support the inherent cultural undertakings, and revitalize the cultural work of the new era, in order to further promote Shanghai's culture and fulfill its great mission in this new era.

As the Greater East Asia War enters its second year, all aspects of politics and economy are doing everything possible to develop in order to achieve the greatest effect. It is rumored that the Japanese authorities in Shanghai attach great importance to the revival of Shanghai's culture, which is very gratifying. In order to further enhance the close relationship between the cultures of the Chinese and Japanese peoples, and in order to achieve a more thorough and complete victory in the Greater East Asia War, we would like to first offer some suggestions on the principle of revitalizing Shanghai's culture:

First, Chinese culture has its own special historical significance of transmission and evolution over the past five thousand years, and it cannot be completely the same as other ethnic groups in all aspects. Therefore, it should not be presided over by other ethnic groups. In the past hundred years, Chinese culture has been completely under the control of British and American imperialists, resulting in the complete loss of the original features of East Asian nations, especially the Chinese nation, and creating a transformed and slavish Westernized culture. In this great era of the Greater East Asia War, we must thoroughly correct our past mistakes. The first thing to do is to make Chinese culture Chinese, to have Chinese cultural undertakings presided over by the Chinese themselves, while enthusiastic people from the Japanese side can be in a position to assist, and based on their relatively excellent cultural traditions, to provide great assistance to the revival of Chinese culture.

Second, the theories and policies regarding cultural revival must take into account the position of the Chinese people, conform to the emotions and traditions of the Chinese people, adapt to the needs of the Chinese people, and strive to make them move upward and forward, and gradually move towards a consistent goal—the liberation of the nations of Greater East Asia and the construction of a new order of equality and freedom.

Third, cultural organizations and cultural undertakings must develop under a culture. There must be a unified planning and implementation agency, a certain organizational system and work steps, and move forward under a consistent theory and policy, in order to avoid the dispersion of power and to avoid unnecessary friction. However, at the same time, we must call attention to the fact that the intentions of people in all aspects of the cultural circles must be absolutely respected, and the opinions of people in all aspects of the cultural circles must be listened to as much as possible, in order to achieve the effect of "gathering ideas and benefiting from a wide range of sources."

Fourth, the cultural revival movement is not like political and economic work, which can seek rapid results. Culture is a century-long undertaking, and it must never be engaged in hastily, and it must never be forced to grow. Instead, it must have a long-term vision, an open mind, a spirit of "only asking about cultivation, not asking about the harvest," and a determination and perseverance of "hard struggle" and "unyielding in the face of setbacks" in order to truly support the revival of culture. Only in this way can we truly achieve rapid and widespread results. Because the effectiveness of culture is not as obvious as that of political and economic work, its effectiveness is often unconsciously harvested in the process of its development.

In addition, there are two points that we cannot but solemnly and earnestly expect: The first point is that in terms of talent for cultural work, we must eliminate prejudices, break down the boundaries between the new and the old and regions, remove the barriers of factions and sects, and absorb talent from all aspects as much as possible. We absolutely cannot allow a small number of people to monopolize it and repeat the mistakes of the past. The second point is that in view of the backwardness of Chinese cultural undertakings, especially the immaturity of technology, we sincerely expect greater assistance from the Japanese authorities and Japanese cultural talents.

For the sake of the exchange and harmonious cooperation between the cultures of the two great nations of China and Japan, for the sake of the development of China's own national culture, and then, with the cooperation of China and Japan, for the sake of the development of the cultures of all the nations of Asia, in order to realize the final victory of the Greater East Asia War and the construction of a new order of equality and freedom for the nations of Greater East Asia, we are eagerly awaiting the unfolding of the Shanghai Cultural Renaissance Movement.

### Heads of State of Germany and Italy Greet the Japanese Emperor Separately Berlin Publishes Current War Situation Anti-Axis Forces Have Fallen into Difficulties

Berlin, 12th (Central News Agency Telegram) The German Head of State's official residence issued a communique on the 11th, stating that, in celebration of the anniversary of the establishment of the military alliance between Japan, Germany, and Italy, Head of State Hitler sent a telegram to the Japanese Emperor expressing his congratulations, and at the same time sent letters to Italian Emperor Emmanuel III and Prime Minister Mussolini to express his congratulations.

Rome, 12th (Central News Agency Telegram) The Italian Ministry of Interior announced on the 11th that, on the occasion of the anniversary of the Italian government's entry into the war, Italy, in order to express its congratulations, had Emperor Emmanuel send a telegram to the Japanese Emperor, and at the same time sent a letter to German Head of State Hitler to express his congratulations. In addition, Prime Minister Mussolini and Head of State Hitler, and Foreign Minister Ciano and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, also exchanged congratulatory letters.

Berlin, 12th (Central News Agency Telegram) The German military headquarters and military order authorities, in commemoration of the first anniversary of the declaration of war against Britain and the United States by Japan, Germany, and Italy, issued opinions on the current war situation on the 11th as follows: (1) After the Japanese government entered the war, the European war expanded into a world war, and the joint operations of the three countries can serve as a model for future war history. (2) Before the start of this war, Japan, Germany, and Italy had some difficulties with raw materials and food. However, now, due to the development of the war situation, these difficulties have not only been overcome, but the anti-Axis forces have fallen into the predicament of insufficient ships and difficult transportation. (3) The US government has made great publicity about the construction of new ships, but as a result of the Axis forces' implementation of trade disruption warfare, the anti-Axis forces have no choice but to succumb. Their operations in French North Africa have allowed the Axis forces to conduct overseas expeditions, which is quite welcome.

Berlin, 12th (Domei News Agency Telegram) Japanese Prime Minister Tojo's conversation with reporters from Germany and Italy on the 9th of this month has generated a good impression among the German people. German newspapers have published it prominently on the front page, with commentary. The Nazi Party's organ newspaper, the "Völkischer Beobachter," published Prime Minister Tojo's remarks as prominently as it published Mussolini's speech a few days ago. The German people are most interested in three points of Prime Minister Tojo's remarks: (1) Japan's war aims are not entirely material, but spiritual. (2) The Greater East Asia War and the European War are one entity, and Japan, Germany, and Italy must strengthen their unity. (3) Japan has an unwavering belief in the victory of the Axis powers.

German and Italian Foreign Ministers' Speeches Highly Praise the Great Achievements of the Japanese Army

Berlin, 12th (Domei News Agency Telegram) German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop yesterday, on the anniversary of the signing of the alliance between Japan, Germany, and Italy and the declaration of war against Britain and the United States, broadcast to Japan, Germany, and Italy, highly praising the glorious victories of the Japanese navy, army, and air force in the past year. He said that the unity of the three nations and their allies gives them the will and determination to sacrifice themselves for their countries and gives them the belief in final victory. At this point, Japan has driven Britain and the United States out of East Asia, and the Japanese navy is still striking at the US navy, making it unable to take the offensive for a considerable period of time. Rome, 12th (Havas News Agency Telegram) Italian Foreign Minister Ciano issued a radio speech yesterday, stating that the Japanese soldiers have made great progress in this year and have fully destroyed the enemy's invasion strongholds. The great achievements of the Japanese army in the land, sea and air can be admired by the world and are respected by us. We still remember the Three-Power Pact signed in Berlin on September 27, 1940, which was not aimed at anyone, threatening anyone or challenging anyone. Its purpose was only to protect the interests of the countries of the Three-Power Pact. However, Britain and the United States did not understand and created the East Asian War. However, Britain and the United States have suffered disastrous defeats in the East Asian, Pacific, European and Atlantic wars. This is a fact that is universally recognized and does not need to be elaborated on. Japan is now responding to Germany and Italy in East Asia and Europe and Africa. In view of the war achievements in the past year, it will surely give the enemy a major blow. The Italian soldiers are also determined to fight to the final victory.

### Southwest of Bizerte, North Africa Axis Forces Launch Fierce Attack Allied Forces Forced to Withdraw from Coastal Areas Only Minor Contact on Libyan Front

German Head of State Headquarters, 12th (Havas News Agency Telegram) This afternoon's German military report stated that, in the direction of Cyrenaica, British tank convoys once attempted a raid, but retreated without success. Our fighter planes and anti-aircraft guns shot down eight invading British and American military aircraft. German and Italian troops in Tunisia continued their offensive. Enemy troops defending the bridgehead south of Medjez el Bab have been wiped out. The enemy's supply port in Algeria is bombed day and night. Port facilities and ships in the port have been hit repeatedly. A German submarine sank an American destroyer near Oran.

Lisbon, 12th (Central News Agency Telegram) According to news from here, Axis armored groups launched a fierce attack against the anti-Axis forces near Medjez el Bab, southwest of Bizerte, on the 11th. Another armored group, assisted by infantry units, continued south along the Mejerda River.

Bern, Switzerland, 11th (Havas News Agency Telegram) According to observations from Berlin, the North African war situation is gradually becoming favorable to the Axis powers. The German and Italian allied forces have gained absolute air superiority and are preventing the activities of British and American troops in the vicinity of the front line. At the same time, after the German army captured the city of Tebourba in Tunisia, it continued to advance. The British and American allied positions in northern Tunisia have felt a decisive threat. Also, the US military headquarters admitted the German army's progress in Tunisia. According to British and American war reports, the German army has transferred two units to attack Medjez el Bab, about 20 miles southwest of Tebourba, on the railway. The British allied forces immediately counterattacked. Also, a Reuters correspondent accompanying the troops in North Africa reported that the German forces in southern Tunisia have greatly increased. At least twelve Junkers 52 aircraft are landing soldiers every day. The total number of German soldiers in the area now reaches at least 28,000.

Berlin, 12th (Havas News Agency Telegram) The Axis forces in Tunisia have crossed Tebourba and advanced southwest, forcing the Allied forces to withdraw from the coastal areas. The rainy season in French North Africa will last until the end of April, especially the rain in northern Tunisia. Therefore, the Allied forces' military action did not gain the advantage of favorable weather.

Tangier, 12th (Havas News Agency Telegram) The headquarters of the British First Army revealed that the Allied forces in Tunisia have completed their withdrawal. The Allied forces' line has been shortened by 50 to 60 kilometers. German and Italian troops have advanced 30 kilometers in the Tebarka and Mateur areas. Reports from all sides say that Axis aircraft still outnumber the Allied aircraft. General Eisenhower must wait until the number of Allied aircraft increases before he plans to launch another offensive. Generally speaking, there have been no major changes in the past two days.

Stockholm, 12th (Havas News Agency Telegram) London Radio reported yesterday that the British Eighth Army had another tank battle with the Axis forces near Tebourba. The Allied forces' military operations are clearly not as smooth as expected and have now retreated from the offensive to the defensive.

Bern, Switzerland, 11th (Havas News Agency Telegram) According to a war report released by the British Middle East Command in Cairo, there was little fighting on the Libyan front yesterday. There was only scout contact between the two sides near the El Agheila area.

Lisbon, 12th (Havas News Agency Telegram) Well-informed sources here say that the first result of the talks between British Prime Minister Churchill and South African Prime Minister Smuts is the appearance of South African troops on the Tunisian battlefield. It is said that 10,000 to 12,000 South African troops are preparing to depart within days. As for the South African people, they cannot help but feel unhappy about this. The opinions of Britain, South Africa, and the United States on military and political activities in Tunisia are also not consistent.

Stockholm, 12th (Havas News Agency Telegram) Sources in London revealed that Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky has visited Foreign Minister Eden three times in a week, requesting intensified assistance with war materials and the establishment of a second front. According to Maisky, the Soviet government originally hoped that the Allied forces' actions in North Africa could save the precarious situation in Eastern Europe. However, as of today, the situation has not improved, so he has had to raise the urgent request to open a second front again. It is reported that Maisky has asked Eden to raise this matter for discussion at Thursday's secret meeting of the House of Commons.

It is now known that the provincial government authorities have restored the administration of Dongliu County and other six counties. In the first half of this year, two special districts, Datong and Xiatangji, were established. Therefore, joint defense should continue to be implemented and needs to be strengthened.

### Ambassador Nomura's Reminiscences Before and After the Start of the War (Part 1)

— Takahashi Simaji

Translated from the December 13th issue of "Weekly Mainichi"

Ambassador Nomura took office as the ambassador to the United States two years ago and made various efforts to improve Japanese-American relations. However, due to unreasonable demands from the United States, his efforts were in vain. He returned to Tokyo this summer. For three months afterwards, he maintained an attitude of silence. On the occasion of the first anniversary of the start of the war, recalling the situation at the time, he gave the following interview to reporters at his private residence in Shibuya, Tokyo.

(Question) What was the state of American alert before the war?

(Answer) The United States had been on alert since before December 8th. The attitude became even clearer on November 26th, when the ultimatum was handed to the representatives of my government. From the central government, through the army and navy chiefs, the following instructions were issued to the commanders assigned to the front lines: "Japanese-American negotiations have reached a dead end. It is possible that Japan and the United States will go to war in the near future. Maximum alert must be maintained against Japanese attacks." In particular, the commanders of the Pacific Fleet, Kimmel, stationed in Hawaii, and the Army Commander Short, were placed on especially high alert. This point is mentioned in the Roberts Report and in other government publications.

(Question) But, in the end, it turned out the way it did. Was this due to underestimating our national power and therefore being negligent?

(Answer) It was entirely due to negligence. Everyone believed that Japan had exhausted all its strength in the China Incident. Especially to be enemies with the darlings of fate, the Americans, was simply unimaginable. Therefore, both Kimmel and Short, although they received orders, always thought, "Japan has no ability."

(Question) After seeing the rapid and decisive victories of our army in Pearl Harbor and other places, what were the initial impressions of the United States?

(Answer) After seeing Japan's initial victories, the enemy began to panic. The subsequent repeated victories further changed America's perception of Japan. In the Battle of the Malayan Strait, the "Prince of Wales," which was known as an unsinkable battleship, was sunk. Then, landings were made in the Philippines. Faced with this series of events, Americans began to realize that a great disaster was imminent, and the weaker ones even began to have pessimistic thoughts. This led to the conclusion that the Japanese air force could not be insulted.

(Question) How did the American government deal with the initial defeat?

(Answer) The government authorities naturally made their best efforts. They fabricated various excuses, saying that the Pearl Harbor debacle was due to too much negligence, and that if they had been a little more cautious, Japan would not have been a threat. They also said that Pearl Harbor was like having your head chopped off in a dream, and so on. Slogans such as "Remember Pearl Harbor!" were posted everywhere, doing everything possible to boost morale. Using words like "Although we lost the initial battle, final victory will surely belong to us," they lured the people to follow them, and the people gradually became immersed in that atmosphere. The day after the start of the war, Roosevelt attended a joint session of the two houses of Congress and loudly declared, "No matter how long this battle lasts, we will not cease fighting until we achieve absolute victory." With the exception of one female legislator who abstained, this declaration was unanimously passed. This shows the resolve of the American government.

(Question) How did the ambassador feel during the negotiations?

(Answer) I am from a military background, and I cannot say that I am very familiar with politics, economics, diplomacy, and so on. However, precisely because I am from a military background, I was able to infer a great deal about the military preparedness of the United States during the negotiations. Leaving aside the military preparations being carried out in secret, I could also roughly know what the ABCD powers were planning and discussing. I always felt that diplomacy and military affairs are two sides of the same coin, and I was conducting negotiations with this in mind. My mission this time was exactly like that of a doctor. My ultimate task as a diplomat was to find out where the root of the disease was between Japan and the United States and how to cure it. Solving the problem was very difficult, but given the traditional friendly relationship between Japan and the United States, I did not think that the road was at a dead end, and I always thought that there was still a possibility of compromise. With this belief, I and Mr. Kurusu made our best efforts. Moreover, I constantly requested meetings with Roosevelt, Hull, and others, almost to the point where they found it annoying. But unfortunately! The reward that the United States gave for these efforts was that ultimatum on November 26th. Now that things have come to this, what more can be said!

(Question) Given the power of Japanese aircraft and the many facts that German submarines have sunk ships, I hear that the United States has also made some changes in the emphasis of its military strength…

(Answer) Yes. The United States is very frightened by the power of Japanese aircraft. The fact that aircraft can sink unsinkable battleships is a lesson that the United States has learned from Japan. After that, they have deliberately made major reforms in their air power. In particular, they are preparing many materials and want to invent many new things to unexpectedly strike Japan. This is something we must pay attention to.

### The Life of University Professors in the Interior

Talk by Professor Dai Jun of Zhongshan University in Pingshi

"University" has always been respectfully referred to as the "highest institution of learning." "University professors" are undoubtedly scholars with knowledge and experts with experience. As models for students, they hold such a noble and respected position that enjoying a higher-than-average standard of living is, in theory, not excessive.

However, since the Sino-Japanese War, especially in the last two years, the lives of university professors in the interior have undergone extremely disparate changes. Due to the high rise in prices, two years ago, the income from teaching was barely enough to meet the nutritional needs of food. Two years later, they are only concerned with survival, let alone nutrition. There is not much difference between their hardship and that of elementary school teachers.

Recently, I had the opportunity to meet Professor Dai Jun of Zhongshan University in Pingshi, Guangdong, who described the reality of a life of hunger and cold, which filled me with emotion. The cost of living in Pingshi was originally not high, but comparing the current prices of oil, salt, firewood, and rice with those of a year ago shows that the lives of professors are indeed difficult to maintain.

One year ago    Current  Multiple Increase

(1) Oil per catty 7 jiao  5.6 yuan   8

(2) Salt per catty 1.7 yuan   12 yuan  7

(3) Firewood per catty 8 jiao  4.8 yuan   6

(4) Rice per 2.6 yuan  9 yuan  4

The increase in the price of oil, salt, firewood, and rice in one year is at least four times and at most eight times, averaging more than six times. Compared with four years ago, oil has increased seventeen times, salt sixty times, firewood thirteen times, and rice fourteen times, averaging twenty-six times. That is, 33 yuan is equivalent to the purchasing power of one yuan four years ago. Considering the higher salaries in schools, a monthly salary of 400 yuan, plus living allowances and rice subsidies for family members, amounts to about 560 yuan, which is equivalent to less than 25 yuan in purchasing power four years ago. Four years ago, the higher monthly salary among professors at Zhongshan University in Pingshi was 320 yuan. In terms of purchasing value, there has been no salary increase now, and it has decreased to less than 10%. It is simply impossible to maintain the lives of a husband, wife, and children with a salary equivalent to less than 10%.

Ordinary life includes clothing, food, and shelter. Clothing and shelter can be very frugal. Worn-out clothes and dilapidated houses are tolerated, but only food cannot be reduced further. It is difficult to reduce further. It is impossible to eat one's fill, and it is also difficult to tighten one's belt. The stomach always digests food with a certain volume, preparing for the body's needs, and does not allow for intentional control.

Some colleagues believe that rice is too expensive and can be replaced with cheaper potatoes. However, after potatoes are cooked, their weight does not increase, while rice increases three times in weight after being cooked into rice. Therefore, three catties of potatoes are equivalent to one catty of rice, and the price of three catties of potatoes is higher than the price of one catty of rice. Therefore, it is not economical to replace rice with potatoes. Some people simply change from dry rice to thin congee, because cooking the same amount of congee as rice requires less rice and has the same ability to inflate the stomach. Although the stomach can be fooled for a while, the water soon turns into thin urine, which is excreted, and hunger is the same as eating less rice, which is pitiful and laughable.

In this environment, it is very easy to get sick. Who dares to guarantee that they will not get malaria in Pingshi? If you follow the doctor's instructions, you need to take quinine pills for three weeks, which costs more than 200 yuan at current prices. If one or two people in a family get sick at the same time, there is only one outcome: death. Mr. Zhang Li, a famous professor at the former Guangdong College of Arts and Sciences, died due to a lack of medical expenses. After his death, he did not even have a coffin for burial. There could be no more tragic situation than this.

### Precautions During Air Raid Drills: Distinguishing Alarm Signals, Air Raid Alarms May Be Repeatedly Issued, Street Lights Reopened Does Not Mean the End of Air Defense

The city's highest air defense authorities, in order to promote the public's training in air defense, have decided to hold another full-scale air defense drill for ten days. The progress of the drill will be signaled by alarms: a long tone for the alert alarm, lasting for 30 seconds; several short tones for the air raid alarm, each lasting for 5 seconds; two long tones for the alarm's end, each lasting for 20 seconds. Residents should be prepared at all times to listen for alarms and, under the guidance of neighborhood chiefs and self-defense corps, undertake the necessary measures. The authorities have strengthened the implementation mechanism. The municipal government has ordered the municipal police and the Shanghai West Police Bureau to strengthen precautions in the urban area. Because the public concession has been in a state of alert for some time, the police stations are now instructing the district chiefs to investigate the air defense equipment of each household. The French Concession previously conducted divisional air defense lighting control drills with good results. It has completed various necessary preparations for the upcoming ten-day air defense.

Municipal Government Issues Air Defense Guidelines

The city's air defense drill is scheduled to be held on the 14th of this month. In addition to the municipal police and the Shanghai West Police Bureau urging strict attention at all times in the urban area, the municipal government is issuing additional air defense guidelines to encourage citizens to pay attention, so as to be proficient and thorough. The following is a record of the citizen air defense guidelines: (1) When hearing an air raid alarm, remain calm and continue working as usual; (2) Each household should prepare air defense and fire-fighting tools in accordance with the regulations of the authorities; (3) Black covers should be added to lights to prevent light from escaping; (4) Windows and skylights should be covered with black cloth curtains to block light from escaping; (5) Households that do not burn electric lights must also implement light control; (6) Do not burn paper money or light incense candles at night; (7) Do not wander, stand, or linger on the streets to watch; (8) Pedestrians must walk on the sidewalks (if there are no sidewalks, walk on the extreme edge of the road); (9) Walk on the left side of the road; (10) Cross the road only at designated locations and do not cross any section of the road; (11) Wear white or light-colored clothes at night; (12) Cover the lens of flashlights with dark paper or paint.

Those Who Do Not Comply with Regulations Will Be Severely Punished

The Public Works Department issued a notice regarding the implementation of air defense training: "It is hereby announced that air defense training will be held in the Shanghai area starting from the 14th of this month, for a period of approximately ten days. During the implementation of air defense training, all residents of the public concession should strictly abide by the instructions issued by the authorities. The various rules stipulated in the Bureau's previous announcement No. 6115 will continue to apply to those who resist or fail to comply with the measures announced by the authorities at any time, or who repeatedly violate air defense measures, or who have actions that endanger the safety, order, and good governance of the public concession. This is specially announced for the information of all. This announcement is issued on December 12, 1942, by Director General Teraoka Kohei."

Measures for Lifting Air Defense Alarms

The Information Office of the Public Works Department announced: "The Japanese Army and Navy Air Defense Headquarters have already announced changes to the air defense alarm signal measures on the 5th of this month. Now, the signal issued after the alert alarm (two long tones, each lasting 20 seconds) is the signal to lift the alert control. If this long tone signal is issued after an air raid alarm, it only means that the air raid alarm has been lifted, but the air defense alert measures will continue to exist and will not be lifted because the signal to lift the air raid alarm has been issued.

When implementing air defense measures, the alert alarm is often not lifted immediately. In this case, the air raid alarm and the signal to lift the air raid alarm may be repeatedly issued several times. Citizens should pay attention: the signal to lift a certain alarm that is issued after one or more alarms have been issued means that the last alarm issued has been lifted. The alert alarm continues to exist until another signal is issued. It is easy to identify when both the air raid alarm and the air defense alert alarm are lifted at the same time at night, because the signal to lift the air raid alarm will be implemented at the same time as the street lights are turned on. However, when the street lights are reopened after an air raid alarm has been issued, it does not mean that the air defense alert alarm has been lifted. In short, the alert alarm must be lifted only after the signal to lift the alert alarm has also been issued.

Necessary Time May Be Subject to Blockade

In order to cope with the thorough air defense training starting tomorrow, the authorities of the Public Concession have completed all preparations under a state of alert control. At that time, members of the Self-Defense Corps will be dispatched to patrol the air defense equipment prepared by each household, and organize traffic teams to cooperate with patrol police to carry out effective traffic management. If necessary, the important roads will be blockaded. Fire brigades are distributed on all important roads, because arson and incendiary bomb drills may be carried out in important areas within the boundary, and rescue teams must be fully equipped and ready to go. As soon as the sirens are heard, they will be dispatched immediately to jointly carry out fire extinguishing work with the fire brigade. The Health Department has established a medical rescue team, organized by all the staff in the Health Department and medical staff, and divided into small teams to work separately. Ambulances will be parked at important road locations.

Exercise Last Night

In the Public Concession of this city, a light control exercise was held after 10 o'clock last night. The French Concession also held it at the same time. After 12 o'clock, an emergency alarm was issued, and the city was blacked out.

### Famous Japanese Musician Kosaku Yamada Arrives in Shanghai

Kosaku Yamada, a famous Japanese musician and composer, and the vice chairman of the Tokyo Music Culture Association, arrived in Shanghai on the 8th and will perform famous pieces in this city. Yesterday afternoon, he held a tea party for Chinese and foreign reporters on the fifth floor of the Cathay Hotel. First, the president of the Shanghai Music Association, Harazensaburo, delivered an introduction, praising Mr. Yamada for his high position in the Japanese music and culture scene. He said that he came to Shanghai this time to introduce Japanese music and to connect with the Chinese music and culture scene. Then, Yamada gave a speech, saying that genuine friendship between China and Japan must first communicate and harmonize the emotions between the people of both sides, and that harmonizing the emotions of both sides can be most effectively achieved through music and culture. With this belief, he left his country a month ago and came to China via Manchuria. He is willing to discuss with all circles in Shanghai, especially people in the music and culture circles, to promote a cultural movement centered on music, and to organize institutions that echo and connect with the Tokyo Music Culture Association, and then complete the music and culture network in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, so as to fulfill our beliefs.

Authorities in Both Concessions Punish a Large Number of Shops in Violation of Regulations

The authorities of the Public Concession and the French Concession announced that all shops found to be selling goods at inflated prices or engaging in other violations of regulations have been punished. In the past two weeks, the shops punished in the two concessions are as follows:

(1) Those Located in the Public Concession

In addition, there are 21 shops that have violated regulations and have been fined up to 500 yuan each or ordered to suspend business for a certain number of days. The names of the shops are omitted.

(2) Those Located in the French Concession

In addition, there are 28 shops that have been fined up to 500 yuan each for minor violations. The names of the shops are omitted.

### Unified Remittances: Large Sums Require Explanation of Purpose

After various banks and money shops undertake domestic remittance business to facilitate trade in various regions, the authorities have decided to unify and control remittances in order to stabilize finance and prevent unnecessary outflow of funds. General remittances will be restricted, large sums will require an explanation of purpose, and will be limited to peaceful areas, in order to prevent speculative merchants from remitting large amounts of funds into the interior to engage in speculative hoarding and illegal activities. However, remittances required by various industries for the purchase of agricultural products, such as cotton, wheat, rice, miscellaneous grains, etc., will not be restricted in any way, but only limited to merchants in the industry.

### Sugar for Next Month to Be Distributed Early

The total allocation of sugar for the China Merchants Cooperative Business Office in December will be increased to 30,000 bags, an increase of 5,000 bags compared with last month. The date for retail stores to receive sugar will also be earlier than before, set to begin on the 15th (previously, sugar was often received on the 25th) in order to facilitate retail sales. Since the implementation of the new sugar system in the French Concession, the sugar distribution system (2 yuan per person) previously set up exclusively for foreigners was stopped on Thursday.

In view of this, this newspaper immediately resumed "Social Service Work" with the service goals of "Relieving the Poor and Sick" and "Helping Those Out of School". Mr. Huang Jingwan has been specially hired to preside over the matter. Mr. Huang is enthusiastic about public welfare and has always been trusted by society.

### Central District Self-Defense Corps Replaces New Armbands

The armbands of the self-defense corps in the central district of the Public Concession have been weathered by wind and sun for a long time, so it has been decided to replace all the new armbands. These new armbands have been completely made and are currently being sent to the Central Police Station for stamping. The date of their distribution should be around the middle of this month. It is heard that these new armbands are more distinct than before. The base is still white, with a bright red neighborhood badge printed in the center, and black text added above and below. The style is much better than before.

### Difficulty in Selling Public Bonds

Since the cessation of meetings in the public bond market, the market has disappeared in a way. However, generally people still want to sell off goods in order to obtain money for use or living. Therefore, although the market has stopped, prices are still discovered at times. However, it has become very inconvenient. Every transaction requires much trust. Only through luck can transactions be made. The sales price also cannot be determined accurately. For example, yesterday's price for Category C was around 56 yuan, Category A was still within 6 yuan, Category D was only 3.5 yuan, and Category E was around 5 yuan. At these prices, most people want to sell but cannot find buyers.

### Gold Ornaments: Internal Market Turns Strong

Yesterday, the Shanghai gold shop industry's largest new trade association announced a listed exchange rate of 3,350 yuan per tael for gold ornaments at retail outlets (with a reduction of approximately 300 yuan for incoming purchases). The unofficial market price among traders initially saw transactions at 3,135 yuan, but later in the afternoon, the market strengthened. At noon, the price reached 3,170 yuan, a rise of 70 yuan compared to the previous day, fluctuating by 40 yuan or so. Transaction volume was low. The listed price for silver ornaments remained at 16 yuan per tael. Heng Fu's listed price rose by 2 yuan to 20 yuan, with inter-trader pricing at 18.5 yuan.

The Shanghai Money Trade Association's overnight loan interest rate remained unchanged at 1.4%.

Japanese military notes were weak and sluggish. Inter-trader pricing was 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 5 fen, 3 li, and 5 hao. The spot cash price was lower. Small money shops competed with banks, offering 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 5 fen, and 4 fen, 5 li as the buying price, and selling at 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 6 fen.

### Cotton Cloth: Taking Advantage of Low Prices with Purchases

Factory Cloth: Yesterday, the cloth market, having fallen for several consecutive days, saw traders taking advantage of the low prices to gather supplies. Market sentiment turned stronger. Trading in plain white coarse cloth was minimal, and prices remained stable: 16-pound Globe cloth at 260 yuan, Flying Goose at 255 yuan, 9-pound New Character at 138 yuan, and 8-pound Zhenzhong at 133 yuan. Coarse materials were considered to be undersold. 16-pound Bumble Bee had been sold for over 280 yuan. Fine cloth rebounded by 2 to 3 yuan per bolt: Rich and Noble fine cloth at 188 yuan, Big Roc at 187 yuan, and Globe at 186 yuan, all had buyers. Peach Blossom Girl's late morning buying price was 302.5 yuan, with later transactions at 304 yuan, also rising by 2 yuan per bolt.

Eastern Cloth: Market sentiment had stabilized. Traders who had registered goods were unwilling to sell them off easily, leading to short supply and high demand. Prices gradually climbed higher. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth's new order price was 192.5 yuan, bank order price was 192 yuan, Colorful Ball at 193.5 yuan, Flying Fish at 192.5 yuan, Yang Crane at 191 yuan, and Five Blessings at 190.5 yuan, all rebounding by 1 to 1.5 yuan. Four Gentlemen broadcloth's red order started at 7 yuan, 5 jiao, and 8 fen, rising to 7 yuan, 6 jiao, and 8 fen, also increasing by 9 fen.

### Overcoats: In Season and Selling Well

Overcoats are currently in their prime selling season. Although traveling merchants had already purchased ample supplies, there is still significant demand within the city. This is due to the cold weather and the high prices of Western-style clothing. Consequently, merchants are buying as they sell, with sporadic purchases from domestic suppliers. Actual sales have been robust recently, and the retail sales at the shops on Chessboard Street are also strong. Therefore, prices for all types of overcoat fabrics are firm and strong. Although not as wildly inflated as mainstream goods in spring and summer, the selling price per yard has still increased by 8 to 10 yuan. Yesterday, the current wholesale price for Meifeng overcoat fabric, with all yardages available, was 375 yuan. Shanghai Yarn Factory's 261 was 350 yuan, Public Great Old style was 250 yuan, New style was 190 yuan, Three Number Gray Robbery was 160 yuan, and our factory's Yuan Cang Weiza overcoat fabric was 120 to 160 yuan.

### Bean Cakes: Particularly in Demand

The supply and demand for miscellaneous grains were scarce yesterday, but bean cakes have become a staple food for some impoverished people, leading to better sales. Market sentiment rebounded. Three carts of Fertilizer Character bean cakes were priced at 78 to 78.5 yuan. One cart of Yuanlong bean cakes was priced at 78 yuan. A dozen or so packages of Wujiang Selected Green were priced at 305 yuan. Eight packages of Chongming New Sand Red were priced at 340 yuan.

### Ordinary Longans: Soft and Weak

Recently, ordinary longans have seen soft and weak pricing due to the reasonable prices of high-quality goods. Yesterday, a certain party offered 60 pieces, priced 150 hao lower than sun-dried goods, but there were few takers. The quality of the goods was considered relatively soft, but the color was still bright red. Buyers indicated they would only consider purchasing if the price was reduced further.

### Pepper Market: Active

The pepper market has been quite active for several days. Listed prices have gradually tightened. The announced price for official Number One pepper has risen again by 30 to 50 hao, reaching 980 yuan. The trend is very strong.

### Second-Grade Red Branches: Stalemate, No Transactions

Second-grade red branches have seen few new arrivals recently. Existing goods in the hands of merchants, due to cost considerations, are not willing to make price concessions, leading to few transactions. Currently, although northern merchants have a buying interest, their offers are still harsh. Yesterday, the difference between buying and selling prices in the market was 20 to 30 yuan, resulting in a stalemate and no transactions.

### Cigarettes: Cloud Road Remains Smooth, Prices Still Firm and Strong

The cigarette market remains firm and expensive. Although British and American factories have announced shipments, due to strong buying interest from all parties, prices continue to rise. Only Japanese and domestic cigarettes have remained stable. The prices are as follows: Great Britain Brand at 9,400 yuan, Old Knife Brand at 8,400 yuan, Pin Hai Brand at 8,300 yuan, Fairy Brand at 7,500 yuan, Five Flowers Brand at 6,600 yuan, Japanese Cigarette Golden Gun Brand at 3,100 yuan, Golden Mansion at 3,550 yuan, Red Rose at 2,750 yuan, Quanlu Brand at 3,150 yuan, Nianzhi at 3,100 yuan, Compass Brand at 2,450 yuan, Domestic Cigarette Pyramid at 6,400 yuan, Beauty Brand at 5,900 yuan, Golden Mouse Brand at 3,900 yuan, Platinum Dragon at 4,000 yuan, and Golden Dragon at 2,900 yuan.

### Cement and Steel Bars: No Progress

Forty-foot standard cement steel bars and three-foot or longer cement rebar head stocks: the market was scattered, so traders priced at a standstill with no real progress. Currently, prices for 40-foot standard size cement steel bars with miscellaneous patterns were offered at 11,000 yuan, 5-fen to 1-inch size at 10,000 yuan, and 3-foot or longer head stocks at 7,000 yuan to 8,000 yuan. Additionally, new angle iron was 16,000 yuan per ton (patterns subject to additional charges).

### Daily Necessities: Few Transactions, Prices Stabilized at Peak

The market for daily necessities has recently reached its highest peak, making it difficult for new speculators to enter the market. Those holding goods are hoping to maintain their positions, resulting in few transactions and prices trending towards stabilization. Phoenix brand matches were 3,350 yuan, Beauty brand were 3,500 yuan, Golden Tripod brand were 3,000 yuan, miscellaneous brands were 2,450 yuan, solid wooden soap was 530 yuan, White Xiangmao was 490 yuan, Yellow Xiangmao soap was 425 yuan, scissors soap was 500 yuan, and White Leishi 洋燭 was 380 yuan.

### When Implementing Light Control, Children Should Not Go Out

Parents Should Pay Attention

When light control is implemented, it is easy for children to get lost because they are not used to the dark. If they are playing enthusiastically outside on the road and suddenly it gets dark, they will be scared and run around, even running past their own front door and becoming disoriented and lost. Therefore, parents must be careful and cautious, keeping an eye on their children and not letting them play outside on the road often, especially in the evening. You should pay even more attention to whether your children are at home. Light control cannot be predicted, so you must pay attention at all times. If the lights have been turned off and the child is not yet home, then you should immediately go out and try to find them. The last time light control was implemented, several children got lost. Among them, there was a six-year-old boy named Zhang who was on the road when the lights suddenly went out. A bad person led him into a street hall, took off the velvet money shirt he was wearing, and left him on the road. Later, the police led him to the Children's Protection Section of the Industrial and Social Affairs Department of the Public Works Department, and a social worker took him to find his home. Such things have happened, how frightening and scary. To prevent this, parents should always pay attention and not let their children be outside often, and teach their children to know their names and addresses, so if they get lost, it will be easier to find them. Parents should pay special attention to this.

The Nanjing Supreme Court sent the case back to the Shanghai High Third Branch Court for retrial, which also recently sentenced Xu Daquan to death and deprived him of his civil rights for life.

### Signboard Wood Shops Allowed Exemption from Retail Tax

All paint and signboard shops in the Shanghai Public Concession, since their purchases of materials have already been taxed, should not be subject to retail tax when selling signboards. Therefore, the association has requested the Public Works Department to waive this tax. It is now known that these shops have been granted permission by the Public Works Department's tax office. The additional retail tax will be suspended uniformly from November 16th of this year. However, all previous taxes must be paid in full. From now on, the purchase of materials must include tax, and it must be recorded in the account book when the materials were purchased and taxes paid, or invoices must be kept for the authorities to investigate at any time. Customers may not be charged additional taxes in the name of the shop.

The second act of this year's Scott Cup football tournament, Yousheng vs. Jewish Association, is scheduled to commence at 10:30 AM this morning at Jiaozhou Park. The referee is Trosset. Yousheng is a top team from the Chinese second division, with many rising stars, and has invited former Donghua player Qin Biga to play as defender. At 3:00 PM in the afternoon, the first division match between Donghua and Soker will still be held at the same location. Soker has suffered three losses in three games and should not be a match for Donghua. Donghua, after being defeated by the Navy, will change its lineup today to try out new players. Longhai will switch to right inside forward, Youliang will return to the right wing, and Shutang will be stationed in the center, forming a rather neat combination.

### Is there a "Jump"?

— Chuan

People who do speculative business, when they meet, their only slogan is: "Is there a 'jump'?" We often hear this kind of tone on public vehicles or at banquets.

The so-called "jump," for example, means buying something for 1,000 yuan today, and in less than a week it jumps to 2,000 yuan or 3,000 yuan. Within a short week, you can get a net profit of 100% or 200%. This kind of business with a "jump" is what general speculators pursue. Sometimes, they use deceptive and rumor-mongering tactics to create an atmosphere that is beneficial to themselves, so that the business they do has a "jump" and they get windfall profits.

In the eyes of general speculators, Shanghai is, after all, a paradise. First, they buy and sell foreign exchange, gold, and cotton yarn. Then they hoard goods, and then they buy and sell public bonds and stocks. They stir up trouble, spread rumors, and fear that society will not be in chaos. They would rather let the general public starve to death than give up the opportunity to get rich. The art of war says, "Put yourself in a dead place and then live." In the eyes of people who do speculative business, it means putting the public in a dead place, and then there is a profit to be made. Their hearts are so poisonous and cruel that they are no better than jackals and wolves.

Because a few people do businesses that "jump" and get windfall profits, all the petty bourgeoisie blindly follow suit, adding fuel to the fire; the speculative trend gets out of control.

To eradicate the speculative trend, we believe that: first, we should try to make the supply and demand of materials correspond. Second, we should not create a situation where there is a "jump"; if there is a "jump," we should immediately suppress it severely: third, we should give idle funds a proper outlet. Second, the major speculators are, after all, a small number of people. Rather than making the vast majority of people cry, it is better to make a small number of major players not laugh. The strategy of capturing the thief by capturing the king is equally effective in dealing with general speculators.

### Chatting About Compradors

— Fei

When Shanghainese talk about compradores, they always think of cars and Western-style houses, and even sensual pleasures; because if you become a comprador, you will become rich.

The definition of a comprador is the purchasing agent or manager employed by foreigners when they first came to China for trade. In modern times, it has become a general term for Chinese managers of foreign trading companies. His job is to trade with Chinese people on behalf of foreign merchants.

Yao Gonghe wrote in Shanghai Anecdotes, regarding compradores:

"Who misunderstands the name of comprador? This has no definite meaning in commercial law. It is a special profession in the concessions after the opening of our country to the sea. The English transliteration is Comprador. In the notes of famous people in the Xianfeng and Tongzhi periods, they did not understand that transliteration could not be explained, so they explained the three characters Comprador in Chinese characters. It is said that the comprador is between Chinese and foreigners to complete transactions, just like using chaff to make a ferry."

Mr. Yao did not agree with this attitude, saying: "Once it is allowed as an intermediary industry, it also contains words of contempt. This is actually the common state of the former hostility to foreigners, because it is also contemptuous of the Chinese who introduce business on behalf of foreigners, as an uncivilized theory!"

In fact, in the Xianfeng and Tongzhi periods, not only conservative elements looked down on compradores, but even enlightened people disdained the position of comprador. Mr. Rong Hong, a senior student studying in the United States, said in his book "A Western Education for China":

"I was introduced to the Western manager of the Baoshun Company by Zeng Jifu. The manager treated me very kindly and wanted me to go to Nagasaki, Japan, as a comprador for his branch company. At that time, Japan had not been trading with various countries for long. (Note: Japan signed treaties with the United States, Britain, and Russia in 1854 to open trade.) I politely declined this position and told him the reason, saying that although the salary of a comprador was generous, the occupation was almost despicable. I was a graduate of the leading school in the United States, so I attached great importance to my alma mater, respected it, and did not dare to do anything that would disgrace the reputation of my alma mater. As a comprador, I was just the leader of slaves in a foreign firm! If I were the leader of slaves in a foreign firm, what would my alma mater and classmates think of me?"

The manager of the Baoshun Company, after hearing Mr. Rong's words, commented: "Although Rong is poor, his proud bones are very sharp. The poor bones and proud bones of the world are often together and rarely separated!"

Mr. Rong graduated from Yale University, the first-class university in the United States, in 1854 (the fourth year of Xianfeng). He politely declined to be a comprador, probably around 1858.

### The Real Joy of Teachers

— Yan Yun

The hardship of primary school teachers' lives is now recognized by the world. Therefore, most people shy away from this sacred profession and do not feel its flavor. In fact, this view is incorrect.

It is true that primary school teachers cannot keep up with others in terms of material possessions, but the spiritual gains are something that outsiders cannot understand. For example, when you see the students you have cultivated making progress every day, when you see them completing their studies and growing up as a group, their feathers gradually becoming plump, leaving you and flying away, your heart will receive unparalleled comfort. This comfort is better than the farmer's harvest, better than the merchant's heavy profits.

Not only that, but every innocent child has a sincere little heart. If you are not arrogant and join them, care about their lives, they can also help you fill in the material shortcomings. Others don't talk about it, just take the author himself as an example. When they discovered that my cotton robe was tattered, they secretly bought a new one together and gave it to me. Although I declined repeatedly, I could not refuse their kindness and accepted it. Recently, I fell ill, and they were even busier. After class, they would run to the dormitory to ask about me, and they raised more than 80 yuan to pay for my medical treatment and thank the substitute teacher. If you changed to another profession, not to mention actually enjoying it, I'm afraid you wouldn't even dream of it!

As long as you serve earnestly and teach enthusiastically, who says teachers cannot be done?

### Sharing the Same Boat Through Wind and Rain

— He Jia Zhi

—— Enmity

The two of them said a word to the inn and went outside. In a hall-like room, they saw twenty or thirty people around the table, calling out and drinking. They didn't pay attention either. When they got to the street, Weicheng said: I am familiar with the road, I will guide you. Weicheng flashed in front, walking with one foot high and one foot low. Huanglong took out a flashlight and turned it on, illuminating Weicheng's way. Weicheng said: "If you flash the light back and forth, it will blur my eyes. Let me settle my mind and grope in the dark." After walking around, Weicheng, relying on his memory, groped to the front of Chen Guofang's house. It was a low bungalow, that's right: there were two elm trees in front of the door, that's right. He stepped on the stone steps, groping for the gate, which was already closed. Weicheng raised his fist and knocked on the door twice. Although it was not 　谷传声, in the countryside, because the front of the door was empty, there were echoes from afar. Someone inside asked, "Who is knocking on whose door?" Weicheng said: "I am from the Ye family in Huag 　叶, and I am here to find the young master and young lady of the Chen family." The inside first responded, and then opened the door. This is where Huanglong's flashlight came in handy, illuminating the area. Weicheng recognized the old nanny who had been employed by the Chen family for many years. Her father told her that it was the Ye family from the Flower Port World.

The old nanny was a little surprised by Weicheng's sudden arrival and invited Weicheng and Huanglong inside, still to the west wing. Under the dim light, Chen old lady was lying on a rattan chair covered with western dog skin. Not much time had passed, but the old lady had become emaciated beyond recognition. She was panting, coughing, and the old nanny was busy letting her spit phlegm into a porcelain痰盂. Chen old lady was spitting phlegm while staring with her dry eyes and nodding to Wei. Weicheng took a step forward and called out, "Tai伯母, is your health still good?" Chen old lady nodded. She waved her hand, meaning for them to sit down. Weicheng said: "We are very presumptuous, coming to visit Tai伯母 in the evening. Guoyi and Guofang, didn't they come back for the New Year?" Chen old lady shook her head. Weicheng said: "We wanted to come earlier, but we detoured to Yidun Town, so we were late in getting here. (241)

### Memoir of the Malayan Defeat (3)

— Memoirs of General Percival, Former Commander of the British Army in Malaya

Memoirs of General Percival, Former Commander of the British Army in Malaya

Further, due to the danger of the central breakthrough by the enemy forces between the Kedah and Kroh defense lines, the following decisions were made:

(1) Move the Indian 12th Infantry Brigade, which serves as the general reserve, north to the Wellesley region and place it under the command of the Indian 3rd Corps.

(2) Even with a small number of troops, in order to fight in the Kedah region as much as possible, the defense of Penang must be abandoned immediately. Moreover, since the Japanese army mainly deployed fighter planes in the South Pacific area, the absolute superiority of air power could be ensured in the northern part of the Malayan Peninsula. Therefore, even if the Japanese army attacks Penang, a location with "no air defense," and even monitors our troop movements, we still have to disrupt their communication and liaison.

Retreat towards Kuala Pilah

With the assistance of the Indian 12th Infantry Brigade, the connection between the Kedah and Kroh regions was completed. As of December 18th, the position was maintained along the line of the Gula River. However, even at that time, the Indian 11th Division had suffered considerable losses and was gradually weakening. On the other hand, small detachments still held the Gunung Jerai pass.

This location, because attacks can only be confined to a relatively narrow area, could be said to be the best position in northern Kuala Pilah. Unfortunately, due to the enemy's continuous attacks on the Gunung Jerai pass, our troops there were in danger of being cut off from the troops in the Thai-Ben area, and the defense of that area soon collapsed. As a result, we had to retreat further to the position east of the Pilah River. This position was by no means a good natural position, and because the road runs parallel to the river, military communication organs on the road were constantly attacked by Japanese troops attempting to cross the Pilah River.

The Retreat from Kuantan

In early January, the Japanese army secured complete air supremacy and maritime communication along the west coast of Malaya. Therefore, the threat to our communication and liaison increased day by day. In order to monitor the coast, we had to form special units with several artillery units to meet the urgent needs, and also moved some militia units and one or two troops from the east coast to the west. Even with the above measures, the Japanese army still forcibly landed and posed an extreme threat to our military communication and liaison, which was something we had not anticipated.

(Translator's note) From this, it can be seen that our naval mobile force is progressing rapidly. During the first weekend in January, the Japanese army achieved a great victory in Slim River, southern Pilah state. There, the Japanese army, using a large number of tanks, broke through our first line of two brigades, which suffered extreme damage in terms of personnel and equipment, almost to the point of collapse. Due to this battle, and the extreme attrition resulting from the continuous battles in January, the Indian 11th Division was no longer able to secure the defense position north of Kuala Lumpur. In addition, the Selangor area and its south, with its crisscrossing roads, were difficult to defend, and constantly under threat from the sea, making defense of the area increasingly difficult. Therefore, it was decided to retreat quickly to the north of the Jiuhua area, far to the rear. Similarly, the Indian 9th Division also followed the same pace as the 11th Division and retreated rapidly to the same location.
