### Eastern European Climate Impacts Military Operations; Various Zones Will Become Trench Warfare; Soviet Troops Reportedly Retreating from Northern Suburbs of Stalingrad

Swedish Capital, 12th, Allied Press Dispatch

The battles of Stalingrad on Saturday and Sunday were mainly artillery and air battles. According to Vichy radio, due to climate conditions, the area from Lake Ladoga to the Caucasus will soon become trench warfare. Berlin also stated that the eastern front areas have begun to be affected by the climate. In the past few days, there has been snow in the Caucasus Mountains, with snow accumulating up to three feet in some areas. Military operations in the northern and central parts of the front have also been hampered by rain. On Saturday, the German forces in Stalingrad only engaged in artillery and air battles. Within the city, both sides used ruins and rubble as defensive structures to conduct fierce battles. The main force of the German infantry concentrated in the northwestern industrial district of Stalingrad, where the Red Army advanced from the northern part of the ravaged city but was defeated by the German forces. In addition to regular troops, the Red Army defending the north of the city also included armed civilians and newly formed troops. On the eastern bank of the Volga River, opposite Stalingrad, the Soviets have transported a considerable number of medium and large-caliber artillery pieces.

The battle situation in the Stalingrad area was intense yesterday and continued throughout the day. According to the Red Army's official newspaper, Red Star, the German army has mobilized four divisions of fresh infantry and one division of tanks to join the northern front operations, attempting to break through the Soviet positions near the Volga River. Their air force is also unusually active, flying back and forth over Soviet positions tirelessly. According to German sources, the Soviet artillery positions on the eastern bank of the Volga River have been greatly strengthened, but no more military equipment has been transported to the northern suburbs of Stalingrad, indicating that the Red Army command also doubts the combat capabilities of the Soviet troops in the area and does not want to transport valuable military equipment to dangerous areas. The Soviet troops defending the important factories in the city are mostly militia and political police, while the regular troops have already retreated. However, they still suffered heavy losses from German air strikes yesterday. The Soviet troops in the northwest of the city launched a counterattack against the German positions between the Don and Volga Rivers but were repelled with losses. As for the Caucasus front, the fighting is also extremely fierce. According to Soviet announcements, the Red Army has repelled German offensives in some areas more than nineteen times. The Germans stated that the German infantry advanced along the road to Tuapse, making considerable progress, and the Sochi road is threatened. Although the Red Army is still trying its best to resist, it lacks the latest equipment and only uses the terrain as compensation. The German air force is also very active in the area, destroying Soviet armored vehicles near Tuapse and Grozny. In addition, according to German announcements, the fighting on the Rzhev front is also very intense. The German army launched an offensive at the end of September, penetrating deep into the Soviet positions. For nearly two months, the Soviet troops fought fiercely and launched counterattacks. The two sides engaged in hand-to-hand combat. The German army, outnumbered, finally defeated the Soviet troops.

Somewhere on the Soviet Border, 11th, Havas News Agency Dispatch

### When Will Second Front Be Opened? British Prime Minister Refuses to Indicate, Urges Reporters to Pay Attention to His Remarks in the House of Commons; Important Talks Are Underway Between Countries

Swedish Capital, 12th, Havas News Agency Dispatch

An American journalist posed three questions to Churchill: (1) When does Britain believe there will be an opportunity to open a second front? (2) Are the Allied countries fulfilling their promise to aid the Soviet Union? Are they prepared to step up aid to the Soviet Union? (3) How much more resistance does the Soviet army have? Churchill did not meet with the reporter but only gave a written reply, directing the reporter to pay attention to his remarks in the House of Commons on the 6th of this month. At that time, he refused to discuss the issue of aid to the Soviet Union based on Stalin's two letters to the American reporter. Churchill said that he maintained silence in order to avoid giving the enemy intelligence.

London, 11th, Havas News Agency Dispatch

Reuters correspondent Harold King, recently arrived from Moscow, said that the Soviet people want to understand the attitude of their allies towards the question of opening a second front. If the British government makes a statement on this, it will be welcomed, because the Soviet people do not understand why the British and Americans are delaying the matter and their strategic views.

Ankara, 12th, Havas News Agency Dispatch

According to neutral sources in Kuibyshev, U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Admiral Standley, expressed pessimism about the relationship between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union after returning from Moscow. He believed that Stalin's demands were difficult to satisfy. He told reporters that he was returning to the United States in the hope that the United States would do its best to meet the demands of the Soviet Union in order to ease the tension between the two countries. According to sources in Tehran, Standley also made similar remarks in that city, and two military attachés accompanied Standley.

Vichy, 11th, Havas News Agency Dispatch

Observers here said that although there have been no surprising developments in international politics and military affairs in the past week, it is worth noting that important talks are underway between countries and troops are being mobilized in preparation for winter warfare. The important points are listed as follows: (1) U.S. President Roosevelt's special envoy to the Vatican, Taylor, returned to the country via Spain and Portugal, meeting with Spanish Foreign Minister Jordana and Portuguese Prime Minister Oliveira Salazar. He arrived in London on the 5th of this month and met with British Prime Minister Churchill. The U.S. side claimed that Taylor's trip was unrelated to his own mission, but merely a visit to friends. However, there is no doubt that Taylor and Churchill discussed political issues. (2) President Roosevelt's special envoy to the Near East, Patrick Hurley, continued his trip and has arrived in Chongqing, having met with Chiang Kai-shek several times. (3) On the Soviet side, the abolition of the political department in the Red Army seems to be an effort to streamline the army in order to cope with the winter war. The influence of Red Army Chief of Staff Shaposhnikov seems to have increased. At the same time, criticisms in Moscow regarding the failure of Britain and the United States to open a second front are increasing. (4) On the Axis side, preparations for the winter war are being made urgently. German Aviation Minister Goering delivered a speech on the harvest festival on the 4th of this month, guaranteeing that the people of the country would have no worries about food and hinting at the future organizational system of Europe. German Propaganda Minister Goebbels also wrote an article in the Great German Newspaper discussing this issue. The main point is that Germany has long had a plan for adjusting the national aspirations of various European countries, but this adjustment can only be done under the leadership of a strong country. Some small countries have doubts or express disbelief about this transformation, but future events will prove their error. (5) Important political talks have also taken place in the Balkans. On the 7th of last month, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini met with Bulgarian Minister of Industry and Commerce Sahariev, and the two sides immediately reached an agreement stipulating that Italy would open the ports of Albania to Bulgaria. At the same time, Romania and Bulgaria also engaged in negotiations and concluded an agreement to jointly build a railway bridge over the Danube.

### United Nations Should Establish Command Organization

Swedish Capital, 11th, Central News Agency Dispatch

According to a London dispatch, the British Newsweek published a world strategy article on the 11th, signed with the pen name Liberetta, saying that it is important to establish a supreme command organization between Britain and the United States, saying that in order to win victory at the current stage of the war, the United Nations must first achieve strategic unity, so establishing a supreme command organization in Britain and the United States is a prerequisite. There is currently a debate in the United States about how much military supplies should be shipped overseas and how much should be kept at home, but in order to ensure strategic unity, appropriate measures should be taken immediately. However, the United Nations has not yet established a common war plan and a supreme command organization, and the joint committee of resources organized by British Minister of War Production Lyttelton and U.S. Lend-Lease Plan Official Harriman cannot handle the issue of material distribution, which is very clear.

### British Appoints Supply Representative to U.S.

London, 11th, Havas News Agency Dispatch

According to parliamentary sources, Britain and Germany may simultaneously declare that they will not take violent action against undefended civilians. However, it can be asserted that whatever resolution the government takes on this matter will be supported by a majority of members. In addition, the failure of the Dieppe landing will be questioned at the next meeting.

Berlin, 11th, Havas News Agency Dispatch

The German News Agency announced that the General Headquarters will soon issue a statement on the situation of German prisoners suffering abuse in Britain. The British side recently admitted that it had ordered German prisoners of war to be put in shackles, and the original text of this order has been published in a communique by the German General Headquarters. Therefore, there is no doubt that German prisoners temporarily in the hands of the British have been put in shackles during their detention. The German General Headquarters also obtained a photograph of the corpse of a soldier from the Todt Organization who was captured by British forces during the Dieppe raid and then shackled. In addition, the British side admitted that four German soldiers were shackled in the attack on Sark. This fact was initially reported to their senior officers by two German soldiers who escaped from the enemy.

Swedish Capital, 12th, Havas News Agency Dispatch

U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles made a statement in Boston a few days ago, accusing Chile and Argentina of failing to sever ties with the Axis powers and allowing foreign spies to operate within their borders, and should therefore be held responsible for some of the losses suffered by the U.S. Navy. This matter has aroused Chile's anger and protested to the U.S. The Chilean ambassador to the U.S. also visited President Roosevelt again today to discuss the matter. Political figures here are very anxious about the outcome of today's talks. Although some people express optimism, many believe that the case has not yet been concluded. Whether Chilean President Rios will come to the U.S. as scheduled or whether it will be delayed for a while is still unknown.

London, 12th, Havas News Agency Dispatch

Lisbon, 11th, Central News Agency Dispatch

According to a London dispatch, the Maharajah of Nawanagar, spoke with a reporter from the British Daily Express on the 11th, stating that if Britain wants to improve the bad relationship between Britain and India, it must recognize India's ownership of India in order to resolve the issue. His remarks have attracted much attention. He said that if Britain wants to make people laugh, it should first establish an All-India Executive Council organized by Indians and make it completely Indian. At the same time, the British government must hand over domestic or financial issues to Indians for management. Regarding the war, the Indian Commander-in-Chief should currently be placed under the command of the British War Cabinet, just like the British military commanders. The so-called Executive Council should be renamed the Cabinet with the future establishment of a national government as a prerequisite. The National Congress Party is still completely led by Gandhi, and the members of the Congress Party should still maintain their position of guiding the people.

### U.S. Attitude Displeases Britain

Swedish Capital, 12th, Havas News Agency Dispatch

London dispatch: The fact that some American writers are doing propaganda for the Indian nation has caused dissatisfaction among the British. The Daily Mail said that the American press often publishes articles by famous American writers, politicians, or scientists who are biased towards the Indian national movement, such as "Indians no longer trust promises, so if you want to help India, you can't get it with empty words. I sincerely hope that President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill can help India out of its plight with practical actions." The News Chronicle reported that London has turned a deaf ear to suggestions to intervene in the Indian issue. The New York Times correspondent in New Delhi reported that most Indians believe that American intervention is unlikely to be effective and deeply believe that the United States has ambitions to dominate India after the war. According to the Daily Telegraph, American writer Dreiser recently gave a broadcast speech criticizing Churchill, saying that it is difficult for Americans to agree with Churchill's policies.

### German War Correspondent Observes Stalingrad from the Air, Corpses Litter the Ground

Berlin, 12th (Hai Tong Agency Telegram)

On the 10th of this month, the Soviet army again attacked the German-held positions north of Stalingrad with two divisions. The result was a heavy blow from the German forces, and they were repulsed. According to a report from a German war correspondent who flew to the front lines of Stalingrad, the city is full of broken walls and ruins. Countless destroyed British, American, and Soviet tanks can be seen. Soviet corpses are piled high. A Soviet reinforcement regiment arrived at the Stalingrad front and was completely annihilated by German artillery fire. In addition to the regular army, the Soviet forces in the factories in the northern part of the city also include militia who are also defending. In recent days, the Soviet army has moved a large number of heavy and medium-caliber artillery to the east bank of the Volga River, indicating that the Soviet Union has no intention of reinforcing the city. The trapped Soviet army northwest of the Caucasus, in the mountain ranges leading to Tuapse, has now been annihilated. At the time, they resisted fiercely, still trying to break through to the south, but were unsuccessful. The result was heavy casualties, and many were captured by the German army. The Soviet army also suffered heavy losses on the Terek front, and almost all of the reinforcements that arrived were annihilated by the German army. There is not much change in the war situation in the central and northern sectors of the Eastern Front. From September 29th to October 9th, the Soviet Union lost dozens of times more aircraft than the Allied countries. The German army is now consolidating its defenses in preparation for future offensives.

Berlin, 12th (Hai Tong Agency Telegram)

A war correspondent reports that there is not a single intact house in the city of Stalingrad. Fighting is still going on in the ruins, and corpses are everywhere. Residents are hiding in the city. The German authorities have now ordered them to leave the city immediately to save their lives. In a large department store in the city, there are more than 70 wounded Soviet soldiers waiting to be sent to the hospital for treatment, but the Soviet artillery fire is so dense that even the German Red Cross team cannot help them. The Communist Party headquarters in the city has been reduced to rubble. Broken walls and corpses are everywhere, and residents often cover their eyes as they pass by.

### Germany Pays Attention to US Near East Policy

Bern, Switzerland, 11th (Havas Agency Telegram)

Correspondents in Berlin report that German political figures are paying close attention to the United States' Near East policy. It is reported that British Foreign Secretary Eden and US Ambassador to the UK Winant signed an agreement in London in April of this year to divide the spheres of influence of the United Kingdom and the United States in the Near East, stipulating that Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Iran, and Syria are within the US sphere of influence, Egypt remains within the UK sphere of influence, and Palestine is designated as a sphere of common interest for both parties. Since the establishment of this agreement, the United States has increased the number of diplomatic personnel in the Near East. US companies have also contracted projects related to expanding the Jeddah port facilities. At the same time, the influence of Americans is also increasing among the companies developing oil fields near the Persian Gulf, and the purpose of the US military's deployment to the Middle East is clearly to consolidate its economic interests.

### Churchill Delivers Speech

London, 12th (Havas Agency Telegram)

Prime Minister Churchill delivered a speech in Edinburgh today, stating that the submarine war remains the biggest challenge for Britain. Britain will not show weakness on the issue of handcuffing prisoners of war. The commando raids on the coasts of occupied countries at midnight should be regarded as a prelude to various future wars. In short, we are at the darkest moment of the war.

### General Zhoravlev Reviews Strategy, Saying Air Power Alone Cannot Win

Moscow, 11th (Havas Agency Telegram)

Red Army General Zhoravlev recently published an article in Red Star reviewing strategy, stating that attacking with the combined forces of the navy and ground army is the only way to defeat the enemy. Air power alone cannot win. This is very clear. Some Allied leaders often believe that no country can resist organized bombing by 3,000 bombers dropping 12,000 tons of bombs every day. This view is absolutely wrong, as everyone has been constantly gaining new experiences in the current war and gradually improving. This must be taken into account. In the summer of 1940, the German Air Force launched a large-scale bombing of Britain, but the result did not force it to surrender, which is clear evidence. Even if a country's air force has a very large numerical advantage, if the other side's ground defenses are perfect and anti-aircraft artillery is sufficient, it is difficult to hope to win. The defense project of Stalingrad is clear evidence of this. The German aircraft used to bomb the city not only numbered 3,000 per day, but sometimes even up to three times a day, 3,000 each time. The result also did not force us to surrender. (Note: The United Kingdom and the United States intend to intensify aerial bombing to replace the opening of a second battlefield. Zhoravlev's article is probably aimed at this view.)

### German-Soviet War Report

German Führer's Headquarters, 12th (Hai Tong Agency Telegram)

This afternoon, the German military report stated that the enemy forces along the Tuapse road have been annihilated. In the fighting in the mountains, most of the Soviet Guards Division and part of an infantry division were annihilated. The German army occupied 400 fortified positions and seized a large number of prisoners of war and a large amount of war material. The clearing of the last resistance of the Soviet army in the area is now underway in the forest area. The enemy's counterattack south of Terek has been repulsed, and the enemy has suffered heavy losses. A Soviet army unit in Stalingrad was annihilated. Our artillery sank a large ship sailing on the Volga River. Local offensives and attempts to cross the river by the enemy forces on the Don River front were all repulsed by the German army. In reconnaissance activities by the German army in the central and northern sectors of the Eastern Front, many enemy fortifications were destroyed. The remnants of enemy forces that crossed the Neva River east of Leningrad have been driven back to the other bank.

Moscow, 11th (Havas Agency Telegram)

The General Staff of the Red Army announced today that our army is operating in the Kerch and Mozdok regions. Intense artillery battles took place on the Stalingrad front. Our army has made slight progress in the northeast of the city. In the Mozdok region, our army is engaged in defensive battles. Southeast of Novorossiysk, on the Black Sea coast, a Red Army team resisted German offensives up to twelve times. Nothing else is worth mentioning on other fronts.

### Working Steps of the Poor and Sick Relief Association, Chairman Wen Lant亭 Talks About Four Preliminary Tasks

The Shanghai Poor and Sick Relief Association is located at Continental Grand Hotel. According to Chairman Wen Lant亭 of the association, the association has now selected epidemic prevention and relief, porridge distribution, education for poor children, and accommodation for the disabled as preliminary tasks. If donations are sufficient, other charitable undertakings will be undertaken. The association also submits applications for assistance from various charitable organizations to the Standing Committee for discussion if the procedures are qualified. If it is considered that a subsidy should be granted, it will be submitted to the Audit Committee for a decision. If the Audit Committee considers that further consideration is needed, staff will be sent to conduct on-site investigations to ensure accuracy. If the results are not excellent, no subsidy will be granted. It is hoped that there will be no indiscriminate waste of a single penny. According to Mr. Wen, the outside world is rumored that after the establishment of the association, the original charitable organizations will automatically stop fundraising in order to unify. Mr. Wen said that the association is currently only selecting four types to handle. There are still many charitable undertakings that should be handled in addition to these four types. Common efforts are needed. Even in terms of the four types, the original subsidy for the original organization is because the association's donation target is various trade associations, and various charitable organizations each have considerable original support. They are running in parallel and do not contradict each other. Recently, the Anti-Tuberculosis Association stopped fundraising due to the establishment of the association. The association has already sent a letter to clarify and exempt this point. Please help the media to clarify this point, and pay special attention to the authorities of various charitable organizations.

### Evacuation of Coffins from Shanghai to Ningbo, 19th Shipment Departing Today

Since the Guohua Coffin Transport Department has been responsible for handling the work of evacuating coffins from Shanghai and expanding the transportation organization, it has achieved remarkable results. It is learned that the 19th shipment of coffins to Ningbo is scheduled to be loaded onto the ship this morning (13th). Because the Haitong ship has temporarily suspended its operations, the Wansheng ship will be used instead. Coffins of the poor with reduced fees will also be transported on the same ship. It is heard that the Coffin Transport Department has subsidized a great deal. The registration for the 20th shipment of coffins to Ningbo has already begun. All coffin families in Jiangsu and Zhejiang can quickly go to No. 2, Lane 96, Jing'an Temple Road to apply for registration. The number of free and reduced-fee coffins for the poor is still accepted without limit.

### Inspired by Our Newspaper, a Folding Bicycle Was Invented

Following the needs of the times, the popularity of bicycles in present-day Shanghai can be said to be showing an extremely prosperous atmosphere. It not only grasps the psychology of Shanghai women's hobbies, but also occupies an important position in Shanghai's transportation tools.

The failure of automobile traces, trams, and bus routes to be widespread, and the high price and slowness of rickshaws have created the fate of this darling of the times - the bicycle - to prosper, because it has the three advantages of economy, speed, and convenience.

However, at the same time, bicycles also have three major shortcomings. The first is that because the bicycle itself is quite large, it cannot be carried around, which often leads to difficulties in finding a place to park it. For example, when driving to a place or a high-rise building, it is necessary to stay for a considerable amount of time, at which time you will feel the trouble of parking. If you park it outdoors, you will always feel uneasy, because thefts often occur in Shanghai. Although it is locked, sometimes it may not be an exception, and it is easily damaged by sun and rain. If you carry it with you, it will either be too narrow and annoying, or it will be inconvenient to walk upstairs, etc. Although it is said that both concessions now have bicycle parking facilities, the question of whether the distance between the parking lot and the destination is close will make it impossible for you to enjoy the scenery.

The second is the issue of comfort. Driving a bicycle on rough and uneven roads will definitely feel the suffering of bumps. There are many different types of bicycles on the market now, but this common drawback has not been removed.

Third, the ordinary bicycles currently on the market have two types: male and female. The male style has a slightly higher body and a higher crossbar device. The female style has a slightly shorter body and a slanted crossbar for the convenience of women getting on and off the bike. This is certainly the clever design of the bicycle to meet the needs of the facts, but in terms of economic principles, the failure of bicycles to be gender-neutral seems to violate the economic principles and is a pity.

Other shortcomings, such as the inconvenience of carrying when traveling, which makes it impossible to use in various places, and the occupation of a large area when placed at home, are also shortcomings of bicycles. (To be continued)

### Fellow Countrymen's Associations, etc., Still Need to Obtain Permits

The Information Office of the Public Works Department announced that, after formally announcing the abolition of the nine offices of this Bureau for issuing return-home permits, if various fellow countrymen's associations and groups wish to apply for return-home permits as a group, they can still apply to the Chinese Evacuation Committee of this Bureau according to past procedures. However, individuals who wish to obtain this certificate should ask the fellow countrymen's association to forward it for verification. The office of the Chinese Evacuation Committee has now been moved to No. 209 Jiangxi Road, 4th Floor, this Bureau's Building, Office Phone No. 363 is still No. 14036.

### Shen Bao Scholarship Donation Report

The test questions, etc., were originally intended to be reported as soon as possible, but they were unable to do so due to the limited space. Recently, letters have been received from all walks of life urging them to be published. It is decided to publish the test questions first within a few days for the reference of students in various schools, and it is planned to select and publish the assignments of the students who participated in the test one after another. Please pay attention.

The previous deposit was 80,525 yuan and 9 jiao 2 fen. The total deposit is 80,845 yuan and 9 jiao 2 fen.

### The Second Evacuation of American Overseas Chinese Will Not Be Realized

The second evacuation of American overseas Chinese from this port was originally scheduled to depart from Shanghai in early September, but it was shelved due to an order from Tokyo and has not been realized until now. The Italian ship Conte Verde, which was scheduled to carry the overseas Chinese, has also been returned to Italy by the Japanese side, and the overseas Chinese in Pingjin who were scheduled to come to Shanghai for evacuation have also suspended their journey. According to the reporter's inquiries from well-informed sources, the second evacuation of American overseas Chinese is unlikely to be realized within this year.

### Anti-Pickpocketing Campaign, More Than a Hundred Pickpockets Arrested in a Week, Shanghai's Theft Gang Will Have Nowhere to Hide

The English-language Times newspaper stated that since the police and the Shanghai Tram Company cooperated to carry out the anti-pickpocketing campaign, more than 60 pickpockets have been arrested at various stations in the past two days. Because the Public Works Department Police Department intends to expand this campaign to various theaters, restaurants, and other public places, Shanghai's theft gang will see that there is nowhere to hide in general. Because of the encouragement of this campaign, everyone has been able to take precautions on the car and while walking yesterday.

At the same time, there are plainclothes detectives in every place, and the crime rate has obviously decreased. However, the police have not slackened their work because of this, and have arrested suspects, thus exploring the truth of their crimes. Most of the arrested suspects often confess to their previous crimes. These crimes are often not known to the police. Therefore, the police hope that citizens can report at any time, no matter what trivial cases occur, in order to eliminate all petty thieves in this port. A certain senior police officer declared yesterday that since the campaign was launched on October 6, more than 100 pickpockets have been arrested. This campaign will be extended until November 1. However, this does not mean that the police will stop arresting pickpockets at the same time.

### The West Union Football Club Held Its Annual Meeting Yesterday, with Campos Elected as President, and Shen Siliang, Shen Huichun, and Others Elected as Vice Presidents. The Decision on the Donghua Reinstatement Issue Was Handed Over to the Executive Committee.

The 1942-1943 annual meeting of the Shanghai West Union Football Club was held at the Portuguese Chamber of Commerce on Avenue Joffre yesterday evening. More than 80 representatives from various teams attended. The meeting was chaired by the outgoing president, Campos (who served as acting president after Lieutenant Read’s departure). The secretary and treasurer presented their respective reports on the club's affairs and finances for the 1941-1942 season. Due to the sudden outbreak of the Pacific War, both the league and cup matches were prematurely terminated, leaving nothing special to report. However, the much-discussed committee system was not adopted; the presidential system remained in place. The secretary's authority was significantly reduced, with everything subject to the executive committee's orders, unlike the past when the secretary held significant power independently. The current secretary, Mr. Spick, who has served for over a decade, has submitted his resignation and been approved. The vacancy will be filled by the treasurer, Mr. Reynolds. Mr. Spick served as the recorder and reported on club affairs yesterday. The total number of participating teams was 38, but the team names and group numbers were not announced. The proposals for Donghua's reinstatement and team's request for a percentage of ticket revenue (6-2-2 ratio) were raised by Edward and Michael King, respectively. The result of the discussions was that the proposals were handed over to the executive committee for review. Subsequently, the election commenced with fierce competition. Campos was elected as the president, and Shen Siliang, Shen Huichun, Naoki Osamu, and Carter were elected as vice presidents. Zhou Jiaqi, a Chinese candidate, was elected as an appeals committee member, and Zhang Zhihe was elected as a league management committee member. Unfortunately, Yue Xiurong failed in all three attempts to be elected as president, vice president, or executive committee member, only securing a position as an appeals committee member. Zhou Jiaqi was originally eligible to be elected as an executive committee member, but he tied with Edward Marshall with 11 votes each. In the subsequent re-election, Marshall was elected, and Zhou was eliminated. The full list of new officers is as follows:

(President) Campos (Vice Presidents) Shen Siliang, Shen Huichun, Naoki Osamu, Carter (Executive Committee) Marshall, Reynolds, Panso, Marshall, Haratani, Hirata (The president and vice presidents are ex officio members.) (Appeals Committee) Zhou Jiaqi, Yue Xiurong, Ya Xupan, Tuogai En, Bei Neng (League Committee) Carter, Panso, Haratani, Osse (A), Zhang Zhihe (B), Fan Lei Si (C).

### Painting Boat Antique Coin Exhibition Organized by Mr. Ding Fubao

Zhang Garden on Jing'an Temple Road recently launched a novel concept called "Painting Boat on the Sea." According to the organizers, Qian Huafo and Chen Shaoping, it is not primarily for profit but to promote art and culture. "If we were after money, we could put on leg shows or low-brow entertainment, but for the sake of conscience and society, we don't want to do that."

The name "Painting Boat on the Sea" is quite simple. The venue is a converted grandstand of the former Continental Swimming Pool. It is long and narrow, bordering the water on one side, creating the feeling of being on a boat. The reporter believes that the title is not only novel but also has a double meaning. Bao Shichen's book on calligraphy is titled "Yizhou Shuangji" (Two Oars of the Art Boat), and a Qing dynasty notebook on painting is titled "Yangzhou Painting Boat Record." Boats seem to have a long history with art.

The first exhibition there features Mr. Ding Fubao's collection of ancient coins from various dynasties, which has already opened. Future exhibitions will feature collections of books, paintings, and potted plants. There are also plans to utilize the evening hours for popular academic lectures.

The content of this exhibition can be said to have three parts. In addition to ancient coins, there are banknotes of various types. Qian Huafo exhibits bonsai and fragrant snow, while I exhibit Ding Lao's refined identification and rich collection, which need not be mentioned here. Ancient coins are a field of archeology; the reporter is completely ignorant. The following is just a bit of observational impression.

After a hurried glance, several thoughts flooded my mind. It is said that China was the earliest to develop, which is definitely not an exaggeration. The ancient coins on display at the venue begin with the Three Dynasties, evolving from natural shells to cloth knives (ancient currency names). The period was probably very short, but the progress of metallurgy was amazing. At that time, ancient European countries were still in the Stone Age, but our ancestors were already in the Iron Age. The craftsmanship and beauty of the patterns on the small coins reveal this. This kind of wisdom and creativity was something that other ethnic groups could not have dreamed of at the time. This is one point. Currency is something for the convenience of the people. From irregular shapes to circles, and further to central perforations for carrying, this is an inevitable process. Among the exhibits, the bronze coin with the inscription "Zhun Wu Bai Wen" (Standard Five Hundred Cash) cast in the Southern Song Dynasty is worth noting. It is shaped like a name tag. The "Shang Liang Qian" (Roof Beam Coin) cast in the Xin Hai year of Xianfeng in the Qing Dynasty is waist-shaped, round at the top and sharp at the bottom, resembling a "four unlike" key. As the reporter speculates, it was probably an attempt to imitate the ancient knife shape, but it failed. China never abandons its retro ideas. Modern imitations of Qin and Han writing styles and modern children wearing Tang and Song clothing also have their own value.

In addition, each bonsai in the Fragrant Snow Garden is full of poetic flavor, and the banknotes of various types are mostly rare and worthy of praise.

"Painting Boat on the Sea" is a socially beneficial undertaking. May it ride the wind and waves and move forward. (Zhu Xin)

### Yarn Traders Absorb Public Bonds as New Prices Repeatedly Appear

Over-the-counter trading of public bonds resumed as usual yesterday. Although market fluctuations were around three yuan, the results remained at a peak. Yarn traders continued to advance, while other firms actively settled transactions. Many high-priced deals were handed over to outsiders. Rumors circulated in the market regarding the entry of new chips, causing the trend to appear erratic again. For example, Class C bonds initially traded at four and a half yuan, immediately jumping to six yuan. Subsequently, due to an outflow from other firms, prices abruptly fell to as low as three yuan. Yarn traders then absorbed the bonds again, pushing the price back up to six yuan. The result remained at 5.9 yuan. As prices have risen continuously for several days, with new highs reached every day and no sign of a reversal, Class A bonds rose 2.5 yuan to 5 yuan, Class B bonds rose 1.5 yuan to 4 yuan, Class C bonds rose 2.3 yuan to 5.9 yuan, Class D bonds rose 1 yuan to 1.5 yuan, and Class E bonds rose 1.3 yuan to 2.5 yuan. All were at record highs. Turnover was approximately 3 million yuan.

### Hua Shares Prosperous, Pushing Wing On Textile and Nanyang Tobacco

### Commercial Briefs

Cigarette Sales Continue to Increase

The cigarette market is firm due to the uncertain supply situation and increasing demand. The local market is also similar, so prices are unlikely to fall. British Brand is at 8,650 yuan, Old Knife Brand at 7,050 yuan, Pinghai Brand at 6,850 yuan, Five Hua Brand at 6,250 yuan, and Fairy Brand at 6,100 yuan, all up 50 to 100 yuan from before the holiday. Japanese cigarettes Gold Gun Brand is at 2,950 yuan, Gold Building at 3,400 yuan, Red Rose at 2,550 yuan, Quanlu Brand at 3,400 yuan, 20-pack at 3,100 yuan, Double Axe Brand at 3,400 yuan, and Guide Brand at 2,800 yuan, all trending higher. Domestic cigarettes remain quiet. Jinian Pagoda is at 5,300 yuan, White Gold Dragon at 3,150 yuan, Beauty at 4,750 yuan, and Gold Mouse at 3,300 yuan, with little change.

Few Bean Cakes Arrive

The bean market remained quiet yesterday due to scarce arrivals. Trading was still sporadic. Chongming Sand Red was priced at 170 yuan for 30 bags, and Tianjin Mung Bean at 230 yuan for 50 bags, selling out quickly. Jiangjian Green was priced at 206 yuan for 20 bags. Few bean cakes arrived. Due to strong demand from investors, prices trended upwards. Fei Zi Cake was priced at 69 yuan per cart, and Qingzhong Cake at 56 yuan for 500 pieces.

Sugar Shares Rise Slightly

Yesterday, trading volume in sugar shares at the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office increased slightly, with a tighter trend, rising one or two yuan from before. The guild's quoted price for coarse sand shares was initially 301.5 yuan, then 302 yuan. Red sand shares were at 298 yuan, with 1,500 bags traded.

Longan Market Prices Vary

Since the arrival of new dried longan branches and flesh, the supply has been relatively abundant. The price of dried longan branches was initially very flat, but as dried longan flesh entered the market, the existing inventory was quickly depleted, and prices soared. The market price of dried longan branches was also raised by dozens of codes. At the same time, there were also goods from outside the industry. Thus, prices varied. The formal opening was supposed to be more balanced, but the prices on the market were higher than the official price by several hundred yuan. This is truly a recent development. However, things will eventually reverse. If the market weakens, the prices outside the industry will inevitably be lower than those within the industry. According to yesterday's production report, the local price of dried longan flesh has soared by 150 yuan, indicating that production prices are also reaching a peak.

Medium-Sized Scallops Increase in Price

Since the increase in price of medium-sized scallops, the market trend has remained tight. After merchants added commissions of 300-400 yuan to the cost, profits were still low. The initial sales price was 5,000 yuan, and the current asking price is 5,100 yuan.

### Clown Objections

— Jin Ruomo

In Leisure, You Discussed Slapping and Laughter, and mentioned the clown. This is not entirely true. Slapping is indeed one of the clown's arts, but there are also being kicked in the butt or farting after being kicked, among other things. As for being unreasonable, that is one way of putting it, and being reasonable is another. But when performing on stage, clowns often portray themselves as being reasonable. For example, being slapped can be interpreted as a facial exercise that is beneficial to life, and being kicked in the butt can be portrayed as setting an example that is helpful to social morality.

If the audience feels it is laughable or unreasonable, or if the pathetic ones feel sad, that is their own business and has nothing to do with the clown. If the clown feels desolate as a result, then he is not suitable for this comic role, because sometimes the clown can also slap other clowns and kick other clowns in the butt. But whether there is a sense of revenge in this is unknown, because for the clown, this is a profession. Being slapped and being kicked in the butt are occupational tasks, and the audience's laughter is another effect. A prostitute sells laughter; laughter is a professional task, and the customer's pleasure is another effect. To say that this is cruel is not without a sense of kindness.

In fact, the audience sometimes sympathizes with the clown, mostly because what the clown does has some meaning. For example, Dongfang Shuo was a clown in history, but he advised the emperor to be a good emperor, which was not bad. But if the clown's job is only to joke and make people laugh, then the audience's lack of sympathy for the clown is reasonable, I think. But sometimes you also have to be careful of the clown's lies, which are sometimes discovered after the fact, thus making people remember the clown's face clearly. But at the time, they sound serious and important. This type of technique should belong to Grade A, and therefore the joke is also the biggest joke in reality, but it is ultimately the biggest tragedy. If you don't want to play the role of this tragedy, the most important thing is to distinguish who said a joke, and not necessarily sympathize with the clown. As for when a joke is said, people know that this is a small joke, that is the clown's last skill and should belong to Grade D.

Someone told fortunes that the other would be noble as a Prime Minister, afterwards becoming an actor. This individual went to blame the fortune teller, who said, "Earlier I had just seen his official robe and jade belt swaying in a grand manner." The actor was furious, saying, "That was just acting!" The fortune teller said, "Originally, I had calculated that you were a false official!" The opening of a comedy is often an ending for a tragedy. Alas!

### Lai Gongliang, Doctor of Gastroenterology and Specialist in Smoking Cessation

Three Movements of Addiction

In the past and present, I coldly observe with a sense of duty and cannot bear to sit idly by.

As someone struggles to break free but is constrained by worries and fears that the method of quitting is improper, wasting money and suffering pain, causing all kinds of bad effects. Or, perhaps, procrastination, filled with regret. This comes from meeting the wrong person and believing hearsay. Therefore, when seeking to quit, one should carefully select a hospital and doctor, not trusting those who only talk on paper and have no experience for testing. As a fellow sufferer of the concealment of same, the physician bears to not loudly appeal and is wiling to apply their conscience to those with a sense of honor, and to apply the health of Gongjian Hospital. Telegram address: 208, Baker Road. Telephone: 95111. Because love is a burden, there is mental suffering and the inability to quit. One should not use inferior tobacco or霸劑 as a way to collect money. One must also consider that I also have descendants and not cut off future generations.

Take Responsibility with Untiring Effort

Medication should be kind and peaceful, so that those being treated do not experience any pain or old illnesses. Pay attention to their heart, sleep, bowel movements, bone pain, appetite, etc. Do not use strange or unusual methods to excuse yourself. The current autumn season is the most suitable time for those who aspire to quit smoking. To gain the trust of those being treated, the doctor can first prescribe a medicinal trial to see if they are satisfied before formally administering treatment.

### Sharing the Same Boat Through Storms

— He Jiazhi

(10) Feilai Peak

Huang Long also sat down, took out a cigarette and matches from his pocket, and with a "chih" sound, struck a match. As soon as it lit, he didn't inhale the cigarette, but the fire went out. He struck another match, and it lit again, and then went out again. Huang Long said, "Damn it, when I was in jail, I didn't smoke for a few months. Now that I'm in the countryside, are they still not letting me smoke?" He jumped into the cemetery in the cypress forest, and finally lit the cigarette. He used the red cigarette butt to illuminate Cui Zhen's face, sat down opposite her, thought for a moment, and said, "What should I say? Oh, I've got it. You know that I was in jail in Shanghai for helping someone use counterfeit money. Who knew that the official would give me a discount of 70-80% and release me in less than a year? That official wearing a Taoist robe didn't even call me Brother Huang, he just called me by my name, Huang Long. He said, 'You have to abandon evil and return to righteousness when you get out.' Damn it, I just nodded. Sister Bian, you know what I mean." Cui Zhen said, "What does that mean?" Huang Long took a puff of smoke, the smoke and words coming out of his mouth together, and said, "If I didn't nod, he would have locked me up again. I couldn't take it anymore." Cui Zhen said, "You really should have nodded and locked him up!" Huang Long said, "That was a few days ago, wasn't it? You don't know that Brother Weicheng of the Ye family is sick in bed." Cui Zhen supported the small tree and stood up, saying, "Brother Cheng is sick? How sick?" Huang Long said, "When I went to his house and talked to him, his illness got a little better. I said, 'I'm a doctor.'"

Cui Zhen said, "You told me to sit for half an hour. It's been more than half an hour now. Let's go." Huang Long threw the cigarette butt in his hand to the side of the road and said, "When I was in jail, how many times was it half an hour, how many times was it an hour? I was just a clock, and I couldn't see it. I can't figure out how much time has passed. Has it really been half an hour? Damn it, it's their good fortune that they didn't come after me. Let's go." Huang Long strode ahead, Cui Zhen limping behind. Huang Long turned his face back to look and said, "You still can't walk fast. Should I carry you?" Cui Zhen said, "No, no, I can walk, but I'll walk slower." Huang Long said, "What are you afraid of? Only that old bastard Wei Yunqing and that little bastard Wei Shaoyun want you to be a concubine. I don't want you to. Brother Weicheng won't doubt me." Without letting Cui Zhen decline, he squatted down, put Cui Zhen's hand on his shoulder, stood up, and ran forward, one foot high and one foot low. (201)

### Harvest and Countermeasures

— Yang Zijiang

According to a Western reporter's interview with a charity organization, it is speculated that unless the social authorities have proper planning and arrangements in advance, as well as thorough and specific relief or improvements, this city will definitely have a "harvest" of exposed corpses this winter.

With the rapid abnormality of the economy and society, and the increasing difficulty of daily life, the formation of this "harvest" was originally expected or even inevitable. In fact, this is by no means a welcome "harvest." In recent years, there has been a cruel historical record. So far, it is only a gradual increase in the degree, with new records constantly being broken.

In addition, there are countless people who are only slightly better off than those counted as part of the "harvest" record, struggling on the cruel line of life. This group is also gradually expanding, and their degree is also increasing day by day. Therefore, preventing problems before they occur, or perhaps how to actively restrain all types of prices, realistically, of course, is not to say more, and improving general living conditions is the most urgent and important issue.

As the cool autumn season approaches and severe cold approaches in an instant, thoroughly devising a method to reduce the expected "harvest" is the time to do so.

### No Trees, Great Peace

— Xun Dong

News from the Hometown

The widespread rumor of "No Trees, Great Peace" and the rampant logging frenzy are probably not unique to my hometown.

Due to the scarcity of timber resources and the urgent need for fuel, a large number of tree merchants (including those from other regions and locals) are recklessly active in the countryside. They entice you to sell the trees planted by our ancestors, which are transported in large quantities, endlessly flowing in the rolling waters to various places.

In fact, even if you can firmly resist the lure of the tree merchants' profits, you cannot prevent a group of night prowlers who sneak around in the dark. Therefore, under the same circumstances, the trees in the hometown have been subjected to plunder.

A cluster of trees, after being appraised by a tree merchant, is indirectly or directly introduced to the buyer. The price of the trees depends on their quality. Trees like pine and cypress are valued by size, ordinary ones are calculated by the number of loads, and the best ones are priced at will. This includes most firewood.

However, there are also cases where the price negotiation between the seller and the buyer disregards the quality of the trees. Often, once the price is agreed upon by both parties, the seller does not care about the buyer's application fees to the authorities or the lumberjacks' wages. He only wants to receive a lump sum.

Take the recent sale of a batch of trees by a relative in my hometown who returned from Shanghai as an example. Approximately two hundred and twenty to thirty loads of trees yielded a sum of 12,000 yuan in new currency (the price was negotiated in old currency but paid in new currency at the exchange rate). The buyer's total payment for this transaction was 15,000 yuan in new currency, with an additional 3,000 yuan for application fees, lumberjack wages, and miscellaneous expenses.

People who care about their hometown, when you return home and see a series of felled trees in the river, or when you visit the barren hills and plains of your hometown, you will probably not be unmoved.

### I am a Cat

— Xu Xizhen

Natsume Soseki once wrote a medium-length novel, "I am a Cat," describing the human world as seen through the eyes of a cat. But if it were today, I think it would see even more.

That feeling came from walking on a dark night a few days ago. People in the city are used to living in a city that never sleeps. Once darkness falls, they become at a loss and have to grope forward, relying on flashlights. But if even flashlights cannot be used, and you don't find a way to train your eyes, the situation becomes embarrassing. You might bump into others or run into telephone poles. If it's raining, you might step into a puddle of sewage. At this time, I wish I were a cat.

Undeniably, we have to trust what biologists tell us: that modern humans are inferior to animals in terms of instinctual senses and claws. For example, in the ability to see in the dark, we are far behind cats. When a cat is hunting mice in a dark room, it certainly doesn't need a flashlight. When it is in a completely dark environment, its eyes themselves are two searchlights. It can see clearly those mice that only dare to come out in the dark and pounce on them, catching them tightly.

However, the reason why cats have such enviable eyes is not that the creator favors them alone, but is generally still inescapable from the principle of environmental adaptation in the chain of survival. Due to the efforts and self-training of their kind over generations, they have earned it. If humans spend a lot of time in the dark, they will inevitably have to retrain their eyes. It's not just about getting used to the darkness, but more importantly, being able to see everything clearly in the dark, distinguishing between utility poles and puddles, and seeing the sidewalks and barbed wire. For the sake of tomorrow's life, we have to learn to grope forward on dark roads at night, or else we won't be able to move even half a step, or we might even step into a sewage puddle, getting our shoes and socks soaked and drenched. Tomorrow, you will only be able to watch others enjoy the food they earned the day before in endless misery.
