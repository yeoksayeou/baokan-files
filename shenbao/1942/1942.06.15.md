### Serious Situation in Libya; Fierce Fighting South of Tobruk; German Forces Knocking on Egypt's Door Again; Britain Hopes to Avert Crisis as Last Resort

German Headquarters, 14th, Huitong News Agency – The progress of the North African war situation is beneficial to the German and Italian forces.

Istanbul, 14th, "Huitong News Agency" – According to news received here, the British military authorities in Cairo stated yesterday that fierce fighting has occurred 20 kilometers south of Tobruk. A large German force has arrived on the road from Tobruk to El Adem and intends to shift the British front line to the Gazala area. The British commander has dispatched a large number of mechanized units to reinforce and prevent the defense line from being cut off.

Cairo, 13th, Havas News Agency – Military authorities here frankly admit that the vast desert area south of Knightsbridge in Libya has been occupied by the Axis forces.

Stockholm, 14th, Huitong News Agency – According to Cairo news received by this evening newspaper in London, after Bir Hakeim fell, the battle has developed northward towards Tobruk. Although the city's defenses have not yet been attacked, they are feared to soon fall into the battle line. The British army has apparently been unable to stop the German advance. Since Friday, the British Air Force has concentrated on bombing German and Italian reinforcements, while another part resists German aircraft attacks. According to Reuters, German air raids are extremely fierce, so British fighters must remain in the air from morning to night. London admits that the area south of Knightsbridge has been controlled by German forces. The mechanized units on both sides are now considered evenly matched.

Stockholm, 14th, Huitong News Agency – According to local newspapers, the British press is gradually expressing pessimism about the war news and commentary in Libya. The British press admits that Tobruk is under threat, that General Rommel has again knocked on the doors of Egypt, and hopes that General Ritchie can avert the crisis as a last resort. The southernmost base of the British army's triangular stronghold has been occupied by German and Italian forces, and its western defense line has also been partially destroyed. The central communication in the war zone is also cut off. All commentators believe that the situation is extremely serious. The only hope is that Knightsbridge can still hold firm. The British side admits that after the German army occupied Bir Hakeim, its supply line has greatly improved. A Swedish reporter said that the situation of the British army in Marmarica is also very critical.

After the fortress fell, the British army's flank was exposed to the enemy.

Berlin, 13th, Havas News Agency – When the German army in North Africa occupied Bir Hakeim, it captured a large number of Free French soldiers.

Berlin, 13th, Allied News Agency – A German command headquarters recently announced a special war report stating that German submarines operating in the Atlantic have attacked enemy merchant fleets escorted by warships and trade routes patrolled by the US Navy in the past few days. After fierce battles with enemy ships, one destroyer and 27 ships were sunk, totaling 149,200 tons. In the past six days, German submarines have sunk one destroyer and 40 merchant ships, totaling 212,200 tons, off the US Atlantic coast, and in the Panama Canal, the Caribbean Sea, and the Mediterranean Sea.

Berlin, 14th, Huitong News Agency – In the past week, British and American forces have increased the number of warships and aircraft patrolling the sea to prevent German submarines from attacking merchant ships, but the activities of German submarines have not been hindered. A ship sailing from the Panama Canal to Australia was sunk by a German submarine one night. Another ship, although escorted by a destroyer, was also sunk when leaving the Panama Canal.

### Japanese Troops Occupy Touzhen in Jiangxi Province

Zhejiang-Jiangxi Front Line, 14th, Allied News Agency – The main force of the Japanese army continues to advance southward in three routes. Its vanguard arrived this afternoon 18 kilometers east of Shangrao. According to war reports, this Japanese force is preparing to launch a final attack on Shangrao tonight.

First, they bombed the railway passenger and freight cars with aircraft, and the Guangxin tracks were bombed.

### Britain and the United States Pay Attention to Manufacturing Artificial Rubber

Lisbon, 14th, Huitong News Agency – According to the "New York Daily News," Palachelle, a senior official of the Asiatic Petroleum Company, told the Gilley Committee that the United States does not yet have a method of manufacturing artificial rubber from petroleum that can be used for large-scale production. The Gilley Committee was established to improve methods and experience in manufacturing artificial rubber. Palachelle said that the results obtained by American experts were no better than his. The "New York Daily News" said that the Gilley Committee is testing the use of alcohol from grains to manufacture artificial rubber, so that farmers can benefit. Some members of the committee condemned the Washington administration for not allowing large oil companies in the United States to obtain patents for manufacturing artificial rubber, because the method of manufacturing artificial rubber from alcohol has been invented for a long time, while the method of manufacturing artificial rubber from petroleum is still under study, so at least people should have commercial competition opportunities. Palachelle admitted in the Gilley Committee that the method of manufacturing artificial rubber from alcohol is more convenient, but the London Times recently received a dispatch from Washington stating that the US government opposes the use of alcohol to manufacture artificial rubber because alcohol is needed for the manufacture of explosives. London is also paying close attention to the production of artificial rubber. The "Manchester Guardian" recently obtained a letter from an official of the British Labor Union requesting that Britain immediately establish two factories for manufacturing artificial rubber. The official said that the United States will be able to produce 700,000 tons of artificial rubber in 1943, but this harvest is too late. He advocated that the state manage the production of artificial rubber and that large-scale production must be planned and implemented immediately. The London "Daily Telegraph" asked London residents to return the rubber earplugs distributed when German aircraft began bombing London in the summer of 1940, which shows the lack of rubber in Britain.

### Sunk

### Sevastopol Port: Soviet Defenders Retreat; Fierce Fighting in Izium and Novok; News of Developments on Arctic Front

Headquarters, 14th, Huitong News Agency – This afternoon's German war report stated that the German army, launching a fierce attack on the suburbs of Sevastopol, has penetrated deep into enemy lines. The enemy's defenses are particularly strong, and the terrain is superior, making it easy to defend and difficult to attack. However, the extremely new "Stalin Fortress" was occupied by the German army. Soviet counterattacks were all repelled. An attempt to reach the southern entrance of Sevastopol was made by a Soviet transport ship (10,000 tons), which was sunk by German aircraft. In Crimea, German aircraft destroyed one Soviet ship and damaged one enemy destroyer. The Soviet army trapped east of Kharkov was partially defeated, partially captured, and the rest are being pursued. 20,000 have already been captured, 169 enemy tanks and 113 artillery pieces were destroyed. In addition, a large amount of military supplies were seized by the German army or destroyed by the German army, resulting in heavy losses. There is still fighting on the central and northern fronts. A Soviet army attacking Volov was repelled. German aircraft attacked Murmansk and the Ruxi railway station. Aircraft engaged with Soviet aircraft, shooting down 11 enemy aircraft. Our aircraft suffered no losses. Six out of seven Soviet aircraft attempting to attack the rear were shot down.

Stockholm, 14th, Huitong News Agency – Today's Reuters telegram to the United States stated that Soviet troops have withdrawn from the naval base of Sevastopol, and the defenders there are also withdrawing.

Stockholm, 13th, Havas News Agency – This afternoon's newspaper reported that the Sevastopol garrison, unable to stop the German advance, is said to have begun to withdraw, and a large number of troops have been withdrawn from the port by sea. The German army is now deploying artillery positions in new positions, and its assault troops have broken through a certain defense line in several places. Red Army counterattacks are said to have been repelled.

Somewhere on the Ukrainian border, 13th, Havas News Agency – The fighting in Sevastopol has intensified in recent days. The besieged Red Army fought a desperate battle yesterday, attempting to break out, but was repelled by the German army. The German army took advantage of the victory to advance and tried to use heavy tanks to break into the northeast gap of the city. At the same time, another mechanized unit launched a fierce attack on the north of the city. Based on the German Supreme Command's mobilization of a large number of troops to attack the port, it can be seen that the German side has decided to quickly eliminate the last base of the Soviets in Crimea. As for the true intentions of the Red Army, it is still unknown at this time. It is still difficult to say whether the garrison intends to withdraw or to defend the port to the death. It is said that the Red Army has a large amount of military equipment and ammunition in the port, and there is no shortage of supplies. The positions it currently holds are also very good, but it cannot counterattack, nor can it transfer reinforcements from other places, so it is likely to have to give up. However, the chance of a breakout by the garrison is also extremely slim. The reason for this is that German aircraft patrol the coast of the Black Sea all day long, and the Red Army's retreat would be bombed by German aircraft. However, several Soviet destroyers have recently arrived in the port, but it is still questionable whether they are there to escort withdrawing ships. In addition, the German army on the Kharkov front has recently launched offensives in the Izium and Novok areas, and the war situation has therefore become more intense again. It is expected that there will be significant developments within days. The German side believes that the Red Army has withdrawn east of Kharkov along the Donets River, but the Soviet side says that the Red Army has already established defensive positions there.

Stockholm, 14th, Havas News Agency – According to recent German news, Germany has transferred a large number of tanks, aircraft, and infantry to the Murmansk area as reinforcements, and it is expected that there will be important developments on the Arctic front soon.

### Naval and Air Battle in the Harbor

Berlin, 14th, Huitong News Agency: According to official reports, German bombers and dive bombers fiercely bombed military targets, artillery positions, and ammunition depots in Sevastopol the day before yesterday. The losses were significant, and gasoline depots were also hit. German aircraft strafed trucks transporting supplies to the front lines. German "Heinkel 111" bombers successfully attacked Soviet barracks, penetrating heavy anti-aircraft fire. German aircraft also heavily damaged several warships and merchant ships in the harbor. Seven Soviet aircraft were shot down in aerial combat. Shipyards and various areas of the city of Sevastopol were on fire, which lasted for several days. The harbor has been blocked by sunken ships. German bombers continue to attack the city, and fighter planes also dropped light bombs. Because the airfields near Sevastopol have been bombed by German aircraft, only a few Soviet aircraft have flown in from the Caucasus coast to fight.

Berlin, 14th, Huitong News Agency: Authoritative sources here declared that German aircraft bombed the port of Sevastopol yesterday, and an enemy merchant ship (10,000 tons) was hit and heavily damaged, sinking within 30 minutes. Several Soviet warships, including a destroyer, were also hit. German aircraft also assisted the army in combat, bombing defensive works in the fortress area, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy.

Berlin, 14th, Huitong News Agency: According to authorities here, railways, stations, and rear transportation lines on the southern route of the Eastern Front were bombed by large numbers of enemy aircraft, causing significant damage. Many trains were destroyed, and several stations caught fire. German fighter planes shot down a total of 23 Soviet aircraft on the southern route. On the northern route, German warplanes attacked Soviet positions and several key points southeast of Lake Ilmen. Several Soviet ammunition depots experienced major explosions. Other bomber squadrons attacked enemy rear railway stations, and one freight car was hit and burned. During aerial combat, three enemy aircraft were shot down.

Berlin, 14th, Huitong News Agency: German war correspondent Li Gan reported that the current war in Sevastopol is one of the fiercest battles on the Eastern Front. The German forces encountered steel and concrete defensive works in this area, and the enemy hid behind them, unafraid of bombs and shells. However, the strategy adopted by the Soviet army is fundamentally flawed, because the Soviet army believes that defensive works can win against an opponent's attack, which is not the case. Therefore, the troops defending each Soviet defensive work are simply inhuman machines, and the result is only significant sacrifice without any achievement. The only military weapon behind the infantry in the German offensive in Sevastopol this time is anti-aircraft artillery, so it is quite vulnerable to Soviet bombing during the advance. Moreover, because the surrounding mountains are full of lookouts and trenches, and machine gunners are hidden in the forests, the Soviet army launches attacks from all directions under the cover of artillery fire when German anti-aircraft artillery bombard them. Although the Soviet artillery positions are also sharp, they have ultimately failed to stop the German advance.

### Rumor of More American Aircraft Landing in Turkey

Turkish Capital, 10th, Havas News Agency: According to unconfirmed reports, another American aircraft landed in Diyarbakır, Turkey (60 miles from the Syrian border). It is rumored that these five American bombers that have landed in Turkey one after another are on a special mission over the Balkan Peninsula, generally attempting to fly to the Soviet port of Sevastopol, but were chased by German aircraft, forcing them to land in Turkey.

Turkish Capital, 14th, Huitong News Agency: Sources here said that on the 12th of this month, an American "Flying Fortress" made an emergency landing near Adana, Turkey.

Washington, 13th, Havas News Agency: A senior official of the Army Department said that there were no official reports regarding the rumor that four American aircraft were forced to land in Turkey, and all information was only seen in newspapers.

### Czechoslovakian Government to be Reorganized Soon

This plan will be implemented in a few days. Political figures here believe that this measure indicates that Germany's attitude towards the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia has not changed due to Heydrich's assassination, and the power of the Czech autonomous government may increase after the reorganization.

### Various Circles in London Believe Germany May Attack England. The US-Soviet Mutual Assistance Agreement Takes Effect; Joint Development of Economic Relations

Swiss Capital, 13th, Havas News Agency: According to news from Berlin, after the assassination of Heydrich, the German administrative official in the Czech Republic, the German administrative institutions there will be thoroughly reformed. The powers of the governor's office will be expanded, and a new agency will be established to oversee police affairs. Furthermore, Lidice Town has been destroyed by the authorities for hiding the murderers. It is said that this is the final means of punishing the Czech people.

Prague, 13th, Havas News Agency: Regarding the assassination of Heydrich, the local radio station recently broadcast a message stating that eight more residents of this city have been shot for instigating the assassination beforehand. Another civil servant was executed for dereliction of duty. In addition, 15 people were shot in Brno, including two engineers, one professor, one woman, and several civil servants. The reasons for their execution were the same as those executed in Prague: assisting in concealing the murderers. The German authorities had warned the people that anyone who concealed the murderers or knowingly concealed the murderers' whereabouts without reporting them to the authorities would be sentenced to death.

Dublin, 13th, Havas News Agency: Although various newspapers in London have called for an invasion of the European continent, various circles in Britain are still concerned that the German army may invade the British mainland this summer. Some newspapers even believe that even though the German army is fighting on the Eastern Front, it is still possible to attack Britain at the same time. Among them, "The Times" stated: "The crisis of German invasion still exists, and the men and women of our country should keep this in mind." Furthermore, "The Daily Telegraph" stated: "Today, the possibility of the German army landing on the British mainland is no different than it was a year ago."

Lisbon, 14th, Huitong News Agency: According to London's "News Chronicle," the acting Bishop of Nottingham, England, Noel Bosi, was preparing to hold a demonstration on the anniversary of the Soviet Union's entry into the war on the 21st of this month, but the city's People's Defense Committee prohibited public groups from participating, and a fierce dispute has already occurred.

Moscow, 13th, Havas News Agency: According to an official announcement, the US-Soviet Mutual Assistance Agreement was signed in Washington on the 11th of this month by Soviet Ambassador to the US, Litvinov, and US Secretary of State, Hull, and took effect immediately. It is said that this agreement does not contain any special clauses, and generally states that the signatory countries have decided to work together to establish a reasonable, fair, and permanent peace based on the principles of the Atlantic Charter, and agree to help each other. In addition, there is another provision that the two governments will provide material assistance to each other and exchange information on various possibilities at any time. The Soviet Union must repay the price of the military equipment supplied by the United States, but the United States should provide all convenience to develop economic relations between the two countries so that the Soviet Union can repay its debts.

Rumors of Secret Clauses in the Anglo-Soviet Agreement

Berlin, 14th, Huitong News Agency: Political figures here believe that the Anglo-Soviet Agreement is different from the US-Soviet Agreement. Because the Anglo-Soviet Agreement has secret clauses, the German Foreign Ministry believes that President Roosevelt refused to sign an agreement identical to the Anglo-Soviet Agreement because he feared that Congress would reject the secret clauses of the agreement. A German Foreign Ministry spokesman pointed out that newspapers in various countries no longer feel excited about Molotov's visit to Britain and the United States because this visit has no significant meaning.

Berlin, 14th, Huitong News Agency: A local observer here commented on the recently established agreements between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, stating that this war will not be determined by documents, speeches, plans, or threats, but on the battlefield. Britain seems to believe that it can hand over Europe to the Soviet Union and still have a say in Europe. Britain believes that signing this treaty will increase its strength, but in reality, the ill-fated destinies of the three countries will not change as a result. Britain and the United States are working hard to supply the Soviet Union with military equipment, which shows that they know very well that if the Soviet Union's resistance collapses, their own situation will also be hopeless. The German General Summary commented that the enemy's secret groping in combat and the lack of goals in the war are sufficient to guarantee our victory. A Berlin local daily newspaper stated that Britain and the Soviet Union have already been fighting us, and the United States has long been providing military aid to the Soviet Union, so this treaty cannot change the situation and only shows the difficult situation of Britain and the Soviet Union.

Sweden and Norway are Both Anxious

Swedish Capital, 14th, Huitong News Agency: Swedish newspapers are very anxious about the Anglo-Soviet Agreement. People here believe that this agreement only confirms the rumors after Eden's visit to Moscow. The prestige of Britain and the United States is declining more and more in Northern Europe. Norwegian people also fear that the Soviet Union will occupy Norwegian seaports for the "security" of the Soviet Union.

Romanian Capital, 13th, Havas News Agency: Responsible sources here stated that the establishment of the Anglo-Soviet alliance has not changed the international situation at all. The clauses regarding abandoning territorial ambitions and non-interference in other countries' internal affairs are purely propaganda, because Romania has long understood the extent to which the Soviet Union adheres to treaties. In short, Romania is determined to continue fighting until it achieves final victory.

Turkey's Neutral Stance Remains Unchanged

Tokyo, 14th, Allied News Agency: According to the Asahi Shimbun, citing a Stan-fortre report, informed Turkish sources believe that the conclusion of the Anglo-Soviet Agreement is only related to post-war issues and has no real significance for the future development of the war. Furthermore, the Anglo-Soviet opposition caused by the Atlantic Charter still exists. Romania is in a very difficult situation on this Eastern Front, so it requires the formation of a second front, but its disappointment is also clearly visible. As for the establishment of this agreement, it has no impact on Turkey's international relations. Regardless of the content of the Anglo-Soviet agreement, Turkey's fundamental policy of maintaining a strict neutral stance will not change in the slightest.

Rome, 14th, Huitong News Agency: Last night, an official announcement stated that the Italian Navy recently achieved victory in the Black Sea, stating that Italian Mada torpedo boats operating in the Black Sea do not pass through the Dardanelles in order to respect Turkey's neutrality, but their route was not disclosed.

### Swedish Defense Committee Passes a Five-Year Plan, Using 1.8 Billion Swedish Crowns to Transform the Entire Defense Organization

Swedish Capital, 14th, Allied News Agency: The Swedish Defense Committee yesterday passed a five-year plan to transform the entire Swedish defense organization, using 1.8 billion Swedish Crowns. This plan emphasizes the importance of mechanization and heavy artillery weapons. A suggestion to abandon the three modern cruisers scheduled to be built in 1942 in order to engage in more urgent national defense tasks was rejected by the committee because the committee believes that naval strength should be maintained.

### Four: Palestine, a Holy Land of Religion

Originally, even before the First World War, the Jews already had a movement to return to their homeland called Zionism. This movement began in the 16th century and became more prevalent in the 19th century, led by Herzl and Kalischer. In 1894, France issued a major case of anti-Semitism by Dreyfus. A Jewish Dr. Herzl then vigorously promoted Zionism, and the Jews also began to automatically move to Palestine.

During the First World War, the British wanted to use the funds of British Jews, so they always tried to win them over. At first, they promised to allow the Jews to immigrate to Uganda in Africa, giving the Jews a national home. The Jews were a little unwilling. Later, Britain became increasingly short of alcohol, which was necessary for manufacturing explosives. A Jewish scholar, Dr. Weizmann, researched and was able to obtain alcohol from wood. Britain's alcohol problem was solved. This invention made the British very grateful. At that time, British Prime Minister Lloyd George said that Weizmann's genius had really saved Britain. Therefore, the British government, in order to repay his great kindness, asked Weizmann what he wanted as a reward. Weizmann replied that he wanted Britain to help the Jews establish a national home in Palestine. The above-mentioned Balfour Declaration was issued in this way.

When Britain accepted the mandate over Palestine, it never issued a very pleasant declaration saying that it would build a national home for the Jews and also maintain a national home for the Arabs, and that it would train the residents of Palestine to gradually become accustomed to the art of self-government. Even if we admit that the ideals of British politicians were honest and sincere, in fact, the two ethnic groups in Palestine, the Arabs and the Jews, were difficult to reconcile. The Jews were stingy and industrious, and the Arabs were generous and lazy. The Arabs hated the Jews for exploiting them, and the Jews looked down on the Arabs.

Therefore, since 1920, when Britain accepted the mandate over Palestine, there has been a series of events of Arab-Jewish conflict. At the same time, Britain itself was either resented by the Jews or angered by the Arabs. In 1924, when Samuel was the High Commissioner, he incurred the attacks of the Arabs for favoring the Jews. In 1929, due to the stimulation of Jewish economic expansion, the Arabs launched a major opposition against the Jews through the Wailing Wall incident in Jerusalem. The British saw that the Arabs were powerful, so they had to appease the Arabs. Therefore, there was also the White Paper report by Colonial Secretary Passfield, saying that he wanted to restrict Jewish immigration. As a result, the Jews were dissatisfied again.

After that, the Arab and Jewish groups have never been reconciled. In the years of 1930 and 1933, the Arab anti-Jewish movement often turned into an anti-British movement. This continued until the eve of the Second World War. Britain proposed a plan to divide Palestine, dividing Palestine into political regions. The northern part was assigned to the Jews, the southern part was assigned to the Arabs, and the area near Jerusalem was assigned to the mandate territory. This plan was not implemented, and the Second World War broke out. Britain had no choice but to rule Palestine with an iron fist, suppressing both the Arabs and the Jews. There has been no news coming out of Palestine in the past three years. This is the reason.

Speaking of those Jews who returned to Palestine, they are indeed capable. They have invested a large amount of capital here and are engaged in agriculture. They have been wandering for too long and want to settle down here and really turn Palestine into a "land of milk and honey" as Moses said. They develop potassium in the Dead Sea and use the hydroelectric power of the Jordan River for power generation. In the coastal area, near Jaffa, they built a new city that is inhabited by 50,000 Jews. They named this city the Mountain of Hope (Tel Aviv).

The minds and financial resources of the Jews are developing there day by day, which makes it very possible to exclude the Arabs. The Arabs hate the Jews from the bottom of their hearts. They say that Palestine is theirs and that most of the people in Palestine are theirs. They outnumber the Jews by six to one. They are also dissatisfied with British rule. They say that in the Turkish Empire era, they only contributed 180,000 pounds to the Sultan, but they have to contribute 500,000 pounds to Britain. Therefore, the Arabs have changed from anti-Jewish to anti-British. In 1933, when the British completed the oil pipeline from Iraq to Haifa, the Arabs launched a major riot, and the British used great pressure to suppress it.

Let's talk about Transjordan

The political areas of the Crescent Area—Iraq, Syria, Palestine, and Transjordan—are all the home of the Arabs. Among the Arabs in these four regions, Palestine and Syria are the most restless in the eyes of the British and French. Iraq is behaving well and Transjordan is the most obedient. The British indeed made a brilliant move by placing a Transjordanian here. The position of Transjordan is between Iraq, Palestine, and Saudi Arabia. It can be a central point of contact for the Arabs, and it can also be an obstacle to Arab unity. Because the King of Transjordan is very obedient, it hinders the connection and unity of the Arabs. When Palestine and the Arabs rise up against the Jews and the British, they cannot hope for the help of their tribesmen in the desert. When the British were arranging the rule of Palestine, they separately designated Transjordan as a mandated territory, with Abdullah, the second son of Hussein, the former administrator of Mecca, as king. The British used all kinds of modern pleasures to win over this mediocre king—giving him airplanes and cars. In Transjordan, the British did not bring in Jews to live, but the British advisers became Abdullah's [illegible].

Transjordan extends east from the line of the Sea of ​​Galilee, the Jordan River, and the Dead Sea, and accumulates to one thousand square miles, with a population of 240,000. Most of the territory is desert, and the capital, Amman, has a highway from Jerusalem. The British have an air force stationed there.

### From the 22nd, the Public Concession will Implement Grain Rationing Based on Population; First Step is Issuing Four-Part Rice Coupons, with Formal Distribution of Rice Based on Household Registration Starting July 1st

The preparations for grain rationing in the Public Concession are gradually nearing completion and have been scheduled to begin on the 22nd of this month. The first step in implementation is the issuance of rice coupons. These coupons are divided into four parts, one part for each week, and are all given to the head of the household. Each part can be used on a designated day of each week at a nearby rice shop to purchase the weekly rice needs for the head of the household's family, as well as any attached households and their families. The rationing standard will be based entirely on the household registration records.

Increase of 657 Rice Shops

According to a report by a Datong News Agency reporter, the number of rice shops in the two concessions will be increased starting on the 22nd of this month, with 414 in the Public Concession and 243 in the French Concession. The number of rice shops has been completely finalized. The purpose of increasing the number of rice shops is to facilitate the implementation of grain rationing. The Municipal Council's Rice Management Committee has also decided to start delivering rice coupons to the ward (保甲) departments on the 22nd of this month for distribution to the heads of households within the Public Concession. It is expected that these rice coupons will be distributed within nine days, and all heads of households should complete the process by the end of this month at the latest.

Rice Shops Must Display Wooden Signs

With this, the first step of issuing rice coupons will be completed, and the second step of grain rationing will be implemented. Starting July 1st, all 657 rice shops in the two concessions must display a white-background, black-letter wooden sign in front of their stores, stating "Shanghai Public Concession Registered Rice Retailer, Number [口號]." The size of these signs is stipulated to be two square English feet. The purpose of setting up these signs is to make it easier for those purchasing rationed rice to verify the registration number of the designated rice shop on their rice coupons.

Formal Rationing Starts July 1st

Starting July 1st, heads of households can use their rice coupons to collect the total weekly rice ration for themselves and their attached households from the designated nearby rice shops. According to investigations, in the most densely populated areas of the Central District, each rice shop can receive up to 11,000 rice coupons based on the situation in the last six months. In other less densely populated areas, they can receive 7,000 rice coupons. Therefore, the implementation of this abundant method will prevent rice shops from being unable to cope with the demand.

Rice Management Committee Notifies Rice Shops

Regarding the matter of rice shops preparing wooden signs, the Municipal Council's Rice Management Committee yesterday issued a notice to all rice shops, stating: "To all registered rice shops, starting July 1st, please prepare a white-painted wooden sign in a prominent location on your premises. The minimum size should be two square English feet, and the sign should be inscribed in black paint according to the following format (detailed in the previous text) with your registered number. Failure to comply with this notice will be considered a violation of the agreement between your shop and this office regarding the retail sale of rice. Please take note. Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council Rice Affairs Office."

### The Darling of the Times: A New Look for the Insurance Industry

— Yang Zijian

Recently, anyone who has paid even a little attention to the newspapers knows that many newly established Chinese-owned insurance companies have been founded one after another, reflecting the special development and prosperity of the insurance business. These many new insurance companies that have sprung up like bamboo shoots after a rain are truly the darlings of this era!

In China, the insurance business used to be dominated by British and American insurance companies, which had deep roots and long histories. Companies like American Asiatic Underwriters, North America, and San Francisco of the American companies, and Four Seas and Paler of the British companies were not only financially strong but also large in scale and had a wide reach.

However, since the outbreak of the Pacific War on December 8th of last year, more than 60 British and American insurance companies and agencies have been affected and have ceased operations. On January 26th of this year, the Japanese side announced that it would dispatch supervisors to liquidate the main 23 of them (20 engaged in property and fire insurance, and 3 in life insurance). This turning point has given Chinese insurance companies a great opportunity to prosper. This evolution has led to the current flourishing scene of the emerging insurance industry.

According to surveys, the newly established companies that have recently joined the Fire Insurance Trade Association include Taian, Daan, Danan, Daye, Feng, and Dadong. Companies that have applied for membership include Huatai, Xinfeng, Guohua, and Daxin. Companies that are currently in preparation include Limin, Dachina, and China Industrial. The amount of capital ranges from 100,000 to 10 million yuan. In total, including the original Chinese insurance companies, there are now over 40 companies. This not only symbolizes the special development of the Chinese insurance industry but also breaks the historical record of the Chinese insurance business.

Currently, the organization of new insurance companies is mostly based on joint-stock companies that aim to obtain business profits. The qualifications for general profit-making organizations vary from country to country. For example, in France, life insurance companies must be joint-stock or limited partnership companies. In Germany, life, accident, wind power, and other insurance companies must be joint-stock organizations, while others are not required. In Japan, only joint-stock companies are allowed, while the UK does not impose any restrictions. Joint-stock organizations and mutual organizations each have their own advantages and disadvantages, and the main thing is to decide based on the circumstances. Their creation depends on the actual social situation and needs. The establishment of these many new joint-stock companies is, of course, also the product of the times.

Currently, the most developed trend in the insurance industry is property insurance.

Property insurance is insurance that takes the loss or damage of property as a prerequisite for concluding an insurance contract. Recently, the situation of various businesses has also changed greatly:

Marine insurance, also known as water insurance, is an insurance contract that aims to guarantee the damage and expenses suffered by the insured object due to all maritime events and changes. Those belonging to ships are ship insurance, those belonging to goods are cargo insurance, those belonging to freight are freight insurance, and those belonging to profits are profit insurance. Before the war, the ships on the routes between this port and Europe, America, Southeast Asia, the coastal areas, and the Yangtze River were frequent, and water insurance was also unusually developed. After August 13th, coastal and Yangtze River shipping were first hit, and then the outbreak of the European War deeply affected the Shanghai-Europe shipping. Later, the flames of war spread to the Far East, and the Shanghai-America, Shanghai-Hong Kong, and Southeast Asia shipping were also suspended, causing water insurance business to be hit repeatedly and falling into a slump. Currently, the number of ships entering and leaving the port is not even one or two-tenths of what it was before the war, and the sea is not peaceful, and war permeates the area. The safety of sea voyages has lost its guarantee, so insurers are mostly afraid to get involved, and the business is visibly slow.

Fire insurance, also known as fire insurance, is insurance that aims to compensate for the damage caused to the insured object by fire. It can be divided into two types: movable property (such as goods, machinery, equipment and decoration, clothes and luggage, etc.) and houses (including various buildings). After Shanghai formed an isolated island, the population increased dramatically, and the development was abnormal. The amount of goods stockpiled was especially large (estimated at about 200 million yuan), so fire insurance followed suit and developed, becoming the main target of business for insurance companies today.

Other types of insurance include transportation insurance, automobile insurance, theft insurance, boiler insurance, glass insurance, and elevator insurance. Among them, automobile insurance was once popular, but because gasoline is currently severely restricted, the number of cars has decreased sharply, and the impact has been a sharp decline.

As for personal insurance and intangible benefits insurance, the amount is much less than that of property insurance!

The income of an insurance company comes from the premiums paid by the insured and the profits from the company's investments. Its expenditures are the compensation for losses and the operating expenses. When income exceeds expenditures, the surplus is used for (1) providing compensation for accidental losses and (2) supplementing the company's dividends. Currently, insurance companies make various investments with their funds, mainly in: real estate; securities such as government bonds and stocks; mortgage loans; cash; property rental income; and other industries.

Bicycle insurance is experiencing prosperity and decline in the opposite way to automobile insurance. Several insurance companies are now starting to operate new insurance businesses! The procedure for ordinary bicycle insurance is that the owner fills out an application form, brings the original bicycle to the insurance company for inspection by an inspector, and then completes the insurance procedure. The contents of the application form are roughly divided into: the detailed form of the bicycle, such as style, brand, structure, price, characteristics, etc.; whether the wheels are in use or storage; whether the vehicle is for private use; whether the use of the vehicle is for professional or vocational needs; whether anyone other than the owner uses it. (Ages under 18 and over 60 must be indicated.) Whether the insured vehicle has been involved in accidents before.

The scope of insurance damage includes: damage (such as injuries or damage caused by collisions); fire insurance (including damage caused by fire or explosion); theft (all thefts from residences, public parking lots, or offices are included in this category); riding damage, all injuries or deaths caused to others (including animals) by the owner while riding are eligible for compensation.

Regarding insurance rates, various types differ from each other, and the main thing is to decide based on the condition of the vehicle. According to the rates of a famous insurance company in this port, the average maximum annual rate is about 1.33%. For example, if the insured amount is 10,000 yuan, the insurance premium is 750 yuan. In the current era of many bicycle accidents, this rate cannot be considered too expensive!

If we say that the emerging insurance business is the darling of the times, then bicycle insurance is the darling of these darlings!

### Hands to Shake, Sleepless Eyes, Lion Faces, Cracked Ulcers... Real-Life Photos of Lepers

— Jia Liang

Doing Their Best to Survive, Courage Still Abounds, the Spirit of Helping Others and Friendship Prevails

The second type is neurological. At the beginning, there is a feeling of discomfort, soreness, and there are also cases with no symptoms at all. Later, the local skin turns grayish-white, the discolored area becomes numb, the muscles atrophy, the nerves become paralyzed, the fingers become claw-like, and the eyes cannot be closed due to nerve paralysis. Even when sleeping, the eyes are open, becoming "sleepless eyes." There is also a mixed type that has both skin and nerve characteristics.

Leprosy is terrible, but it is not an incurable disease. As long as patients do not hide their illness and avoid treatment, and seek treatment as soon as possible, there is absolutely no danger. There are several people in the leprosy hospital who are almost indistinguishable from ordinary people because they sought treatment as soon as the disease appeared. The method of preventing leprosy is to isolate yourself from patients and focus on nutrition to strengthen resistance. If someone develops red spots or skin discoloration, you can use a needle to prick the area with spots or discoloration. If you don't feel pain, you may have leprosy and should seek a medical diagnosis as soon as possible.

The organizer of the Chinese Leprosy Hospital is the Chinese Leprosy Relief Association at 53, Lane 612, Jing'an Temple Road. According to the association's estimates, there are about one million lepers in various parts of China, and there are more than 40 leprosy clinics across the country. Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, the source of funding has been severely hit, and foreign donations have been cut off. However, the cost of about 200 yuan per month for each leper has increased rather than decreased, so it has been decided to hold a 150,000 yuan fundraising campaign from the 16th of this month to raise funds for maintenance.

Leprosy is an individual's disease, but preventing the spread of leprosy is a social task, a social responsibility. No wonder the people in the Chinese Leprosy Relief Association say that they hope "enthusiastic ladies and gentlemen in the community will generously donate." (End of article)

### Shanghai Municipal Council Chinese Education Office Free Examination Completed

The free entrance examination for middle school students established by the Chinese Education Office of the Shanghai Municipal Council to subsidize poor youth and reward outstanding students was completed yesterday at Xinzha Elementary School on Xinzha Road. According to the reporter in charge of the office, although the number of students taking the exam this time was small, the results were all excellent, surpassing those of previous sessions. As for the date of the announcement, it will be necessary to wait for one week. It is said that in addition to being disclosed in newspapers, the candidates who are admitted will be notified separately by the examiner, and the schools that recommend them for the exam (those who are not admitted will no longer be notified by letter). As for the students, it has been decided not to notify them separately by letter, so all students who take the exam and want to know the results of the exam can directly ask the school.

### Bund Park Evening Closing Time

As summer approaches and the climate gradually warms, according to usual practice, the parks in the British and French concessions are both open until 10:30 PM. However, visitors to Bund Park mostly stroll around after dinner because it is close to the Bund and the ocean breeze is cooler in the evening. However, recently, other parks have extended their visiting hours one after another, but Bund Park still closes at 8:00 PM every day.

### French Concession Authorities Strictly Prohibit Raising Prices and Dispatch Personnel to Conduct Strict Inspections; Violators Will Be Severely Punished

The cost of living in Shanghai has skyrocketed, and recently it has been rising extremely wildly. Although the authorities have paid attention to and tried their best to stop it, merchants have devised many clever tricks, making it difficult for market prices to fall back. Recently, at the time of the transition between the old and new monetary systems, most stores took the opportunity to secretly raise prices. The citizens are living in dire straits and complaining endlessly. The French Concession authorities, in view of this, believe that merchants' secret price increases not only affect the lives of citizens but also hinder the entire market. In addition to strictly evaluating the market prices of various goods, they have also dispatched personnel to go out and conduct secret inspections in various vegetable markets and stores. If they find any violations of the evaluated prices or private price increases, they will be severely punished in order to stabilize prices and relieve the people's suffering. The general public is overjoyed to hear this.

### Zhu Brothers Abuse Stepmother; A Scene of Martial Drama at Hualong Hospital

At about 2:30 PM on the 12th of this month, a commotion suddenly broke out in the accounting room on the ground floor of Hualong Hospital at the intersection of Route Belleserre and Avenue Messimy in the French Concession. The atmosphere was tense. At that time, a certain Mr. [某君] in the hospital's accounting room was beaten and bled from the face, and several tea boys were also beaten. The patients who were staying in the hospital for treatment were panicked. Patients in serious condition were greatly stimulated mentally, and their conditions worsened. According to the patients in the hospital, two Zhu brothers led a group of people into the hospital with the intention of taking action against their stepmother, who was staying in the hospital for treatment. Because the Zhu brothers have always been at odds with their stepmother and often abused her. At that time, the two brothers used the excuse of visiting the patient, but they had other intentions. Since their stepmother was out getting an injection at a Western doctor's office, the Zhu brothers wanted to enter the ward to visit, but they were repeatedly stopped by the hospital manager. The two brothers did not ask for the reason and started beating people, causing the patients in the hospital to be frightened. In recent years, there have been many cases of abuse of direct relatives in Shanghai. The most prominent examples are the Zhou brothers who were hanged on the 10th of this month for murdering their biological father, and a certain son on Route Cardinal Mercier who hammered his biological father to death with an iron dumbbell. Such acts are not tolerated by the law. As a result, the unfilial sons were all sentenced to death. Now there is another incident of Zhu brothers abusing their stepmother, which is regrettable. Young people who have received considerable education and come from noble families are so disobedient to their elders, despise the law, and disregard morality. If this continues to escalate, they will definitely suffer the consequences.

### Woman Caught Smuggling Opium

A Suzhou woman surnamed Wang and surnamed Yu, about 40 years old, bought several taels of opium from an opium dealer in Nine Acres Place the day before yesterday afternoon. She hid it on her body and planned to transport it into the concession for sale. When she passed the iron gate of Dongxinqiao in the French Concession, she was stopped and searched by the female search team stationed there. The opium was confiscated, and she was taken to the police station. According to her confession, she bought it to cook and smoke at home and denied selling it. The police chief ordered her to be detained pending investigation and prosecution according to law.

### Enticing a Neighbor's Daughter into Prostitution; The Plot Failed and She Was Arrested; Zhong Yuan's Motives Were Sinister, and Gu Xiuying Escaped Cleverly

Gu Xiuying, a 19-year-old local woman living at 412 Tokyo Road, was slightly attractive and was bewitched by Zhong Yuan, a Jiangbei woman, who lived next door. She falsely claimed that a factory at 103 Route Frelupt was recruiting female workers, and those with fashionable looks could earn 300 yuan a month. The young and ignorant girl believed it and discussed it with her mother, who agreed to let her go. Seeing that she had been trapped, Zhong claimed that according to the factory's regulations, a contract had to be signed first, otherwise the goal could not be achieved. She also asked the girl to get a perm, dress fashionably, and apply nail polish and powder, and gave her 140 yuan in legal tender as a settlement allowance. Both Gu and her mother followed her instructions. At 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, Zhong and Luo Liu, a Jiangbei woman surnamed Wu Qianzhang, accompanied Gu to the place, and then they took the opportunity to escape one after another. Gu realized that the place was not a factory but a private brothel. After a while, she secretly ran home and told her mother, and reported it to the Gordon Road Police Station. Detective Bai Wenqi was dispatched to arrest Zhong Yuan, Luo Liu, and Wu Qianzhang. He also went to the brothel at 103 Route Frelupt for investigation and confirmed that Xue Landi, a 19-year-old Jiangbei woman who was lured there by Zhong and others to engage in flesh trade last winter, was also taken to the police station. Yesterday, they were sent to court on charges of kidnapping decent women into prostitution and requested detention pending further investigation.

### Japanese Military Police Expose Anti-Japanese Leaders of Foreign Newspapers; Accuse Powell and Others of Espionage

According to the Domei News Agency, the Japanese military police in Shanghai have, since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese Incident, protected under local institutions in the concession, engaged in anti-Japanese espionage and propagandist strategems for the leaders of the Shanghai media circles. They have, since December of last year until March of this year, separately apprehended and detained Millers Review journalist Miss Beryl Powell (55 years old), journalist for the China Press (大美晚報) Ober (30 years old), editor and critic for the Far Eastern Review Woodhead (58 years old), and more than ten people related to the case. Based on numerous documentary evidence and other clues, after a thorough investigation, the truth about anti-Japanese espionage and propaganda strategems has been revealed. The aforementioned three main figures have been handed over to a military tribunal for interrogation on charges of espionage and disturbing the peace. It has been discovered that their reports to their home countries have not only been used as important data for their home countries' policy decisions on Japan, but their espionage and propaganda have also exacerbated Japan's international environment, and it can be asserted that the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War was actually caused by them. The experiences and activities of the individuals involved in this case are as follows (to be continued).

### Recollections of Past Travels

— Qian Ding

(II) Meeting an Old Friend in a Foreign Land

In the twelfth month of the sixteenth year, I held a painting exhibition in Harbin and engaged in some social interactions. Then, I took the Chinese Eastern Railway train, crossed the Greater Khingan Range, and arrived at Manchuria Station. Along the way, I only saw a vast expanse of ice and snow, a completely cool world. Due to the extreme cold, I couldn't go out for sightseeing or sketching. I could only read books or create traditional Chinese paintings to pass the time in the hotel. After staying here for several days, I felt lonely and planned to leave immediately. In the morning, I wrote several letters first. Just as I was about to send them, I suddenly remembered that two years ago, I had received a letter from my friend Mr. Dong from Manchuria Station in Beiping, informing me that he was working at the Railway Bureau here. Therefore, I immediately tried sending a letter to him. At noon, someone came to inquire and pushed open my room door. It was indeed Mr. Dong! We shook hands tightly, overjoyed to see each other. In this cold frontier, living as a lonely traveler, I suddenly encountered an old friend from afar, meeting a familiar face in a foreign land. My heart was filled with immense joy! Mr. Dong felt the same way. He thought I was passing through here on my way to Russia. He didn't expect that I had come to sketch, braving the cold and snow on a long journey. He wanted me to stay here for a few more days to have a good chat. Meeting Mr. Dong here was indeed rare, and I enjoyed the opportunity to catch up. He lived with a Russian colleague's family, so I painted an oil portrait of a bearded Russian man. This colleague was a descendant of an old Russian aristocrat who had come to this place after the revolution and had many children. There were two girls, about fourteen or fifteen years old, lively and lovely, always diligent and hardworking. Every day after returning from school, they would help their mother cook, tidy up the house, and scrub the floor barefoot. In the evening, they would do their homework with their younger siblings under the lamp. I found it very interesting to see so many children studying under the lamp, or asking and answering questions with each other. I quickly sketched a few portraits in pencil on the side, which they all asked for. Mr. Dong's small room was quiet and clean, with various landscape photos he had taken himself hanging on the wall, as well as a photo of him and his lover playing in Zhongshan Park in Beiping. He pointed to the photo and said that he had to send her a letter every day, and he openly showed me her short notes. This woman was full of literary talent, with beautiful handwriting, which was a pleasure to read. After showing it to me, he often sighed and said, "What should I do?" Mr. Dong was a passionate, humorous, and lively young man. When he talked about how to achieve a perfect result, he couldn't help but reveal a serious expression and said, "What should I do?" His expression seemed somewhat distressed, as if he wanted to discuss it with me. I said to him, "Wait until she graduates from college, and you will naturally get a perfect result." Afterwards, he talked about the border conflict between China and Russia. After the peaceful resolution, he picked up an empty artillery shell containing candy sent by a foreigner to his lover. Unexpectedly, when it was sent to Beiping, it was during a period of strict security checks. The military police inspected the package and found this heavy and suspicious object. Upon opening it, they were shocked to find a large artillery shell filled with beautiful candy. The military police didn't dare to try it, thinking there might be some trickery inside. They checked the address on the package and interrogated the recipient of this suspicious package, and searched her house, frightening everyone. Later, after explaining the situation, everything was cleared up. He told me many funny stories, which I found very interesting. Every day after work, he would come to my lodging to chat and laugh, or have a small drink, or go out to photograph in the snow, or invite me to his landlord's house to taste Russian home-cooked meals, or attend a dance party at the Russian club in the evening. However, Mr. Dong didn't like dancing and would sit there dozing off, while I would set up a fortune-telling stall, just for fun, and watch the excitement. Sometimes, the hotel manager would come to my room to talk about local customs, such as how local people hunted marmots in the wild, or how they caught carp by cutting ice in Lake Dalai, which were all very interesting to hear. This rich and interesting life passed quickly for more than thirty days, and I decided on a date to leave this desolate place. That night, he saw me off on the train. In the lonely and clear scene, at the moment the train moved, we quietly said goodbye.

After leaving Harbin, I went straight to the desolate frontier. In this lonely journey, I suddenly met Mr. Dong, which led to a rich and interesting life. Mr. Dong, in the golden age of love, had a lot of joy and also a lot of distress. After I returned to Beiping from my trip, he also achieved his ideal perfect result. Now, recalling the scene from fourteen or fifteen years ago, it is still vivid in my mind. Life is like an illusion. All the efforts, struggles, joys, sorrows, safety, and danger, all the various situations, are actually driven by a kind of love. Therefore, I feel that the existence and prosperity of all life originate from love, flourish with beauty, and grow with truth and goodness. Since the evolution of human life and the prosperity of civilization, such as Jesus's universal love to save the world, Sakyamuni's attainment of good fruits, compassion, Confucius and Mencius's emphasis on benevolence and righteousness, clarifying human relations, Lao Zhuang's advocacy of nature, morality, Yangming's pursuit of the unity of knowledge and action, scholars' understanding of principles and seeking truth, artists' aesthetic appreciation and art activities, patriots' love of country and governance, men and women's marriage for love, parents' upbringing of children, brothers' close relationship like hands and feet, and friends' mutual assistance in morality, all are based on love as the original cause, and all flourish and grow in love. To explore the origin of love can be summarized into three: God, matter, and spirit. God is metaphysical, eternally unchanging; matter is physical, changing at any time; the spirit is in the middle, living appropriately. I remember what a person from Mount Qian said, "To make essence and energy rise upward to obtain its spirit, but to be burdened by desires, the spirit will wither." The meaning is that if a person's spirit is burdened by desires and withers, then matter cannot exist. At this point, there is no true love, and there is no life. Therefore, any human group, if it is filled with greed and the habit of seeking temporary peace, does not know how to live appropriately to seek the existence of true love, the existence of ambition and interest, then it will never see prosperity and growth, or even face the tragic fate of being on the verge of withering. From this, we can know that all aspects of our lives should seek to develop the source of true love every day, not to restrain or exhaust it, so that the garden of life does not lose its irrigation and dry up. I also think that fifteen years ago, in a desolate and lonely situation, I actually gained a rich and interesting life. Therefore, I also know that Mr. Dong, in the joys and sorrows of true love, and in the efforts of life, finally achieved a perfect result. It seems that there is a natural true God who is protecting us, tempering us, and perfecting us. From this, we can know that God helps those who help themselves. Only when we can realize ourselves and work hard, can we turn danger into safety. Although we are now living in a prosperous city, it is actually more difficult than living in a desolate and lonely environment. But how can we still obtain a rich and interesting life, how can we still obtain a life of true love and happiness? This still requires us to be aware and work hard, not to be vain, not to be confused. I think the true God of nature will come in time to fulfill everything.

### Seas of People Watch Round Gate Ball; Nanyang Mixed Team and Central China Draw; China United Team A Unluckily Loses to South China; Women's Performance of Rattling Bells Wins Over Patriotism

The Guo Bin Cup Round Gate Ball League competition kicked off yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM at the Guangxia Middle School on Moore Road. Spectators who came to watch reached several thousands, breaking the previous record for the Guangxia Middle School ball field.

Southern Film Queen

Ms. Li Qinian attended the event and performed the ball-handling ceremony. As a result, the women's performance of rattling bells relied on the average talent and defeated the Central China Team A, composed of patriotic movie stars, by a small margin of two to one. Due to being surrounded by the audience, their strength was greatly reduced and lost to South China by a score of one to three. The Nanyang mixed team played fiercely and could not be separated, and finally drew with Central China with three goals each.

Women Take the Field

Zhang Bihua of the Rattling Bells team was the first to score. Wang Weizhen of the Patriotism team was not willing to be outdone and scored a goal with great difficulty. In the first half, each team had a tie. In the second match, the ladies from both teams each went their own way. At the seventh minute, Wei Peihui of the Rattling Bells team had a delicate hand and scored a goal in the right corner, thus setting the victory and defeating the Patriotism team by a score of two to one. In the first men's performance, as soon as both sides made contact, the China United Team A, under the cheers of thousands of

Viewers Celebrated

and with the assistance of Shu Shi and De Mei Xi, opened the record first. The generals of South China came to invade, and when He Jinkui started, the ball had already entered the net. Fan Jinyong, the goalkeeper of the Central China team, was caught off guard and announced the loss of the city. Halfway through the game, the audience was too crowded, and the major stars were surrounded. In the situation where it was impossible to continue the competition, the

Star Players

turned to retirement to prepare for replenishment. The huge waves began to calm down, and Liu Fuqiang of South China took the opportunity to try to recover. At that time, with momentum, the plum blossoms were second, and South China defeated the United Team A by two to one. The mixed Nanyang conference battle began. Han Longhai of Nanyang gave a small test of his abilities and scored a goal in the chaotic situation first. In less than two minutes, Han Longhai followed the same pattern and scored again. The mixed battle line,

Enemy Cavalry Raged

In 20 minutes, Ma Canxi of the mixed team returned the favor. In the first half, Nanyang led by two to one. After choosing a place to fight again, the mixed team desperately counterattacked, and Zhang Shaoqing rode alone to build a monument and return. After three times of entanglement, Li Yao of Nanyang cleverly used the empty-heart plan to win back a goal. Seeing that the situation was not good, Zhang Shaoqing of the mixed team saw injustice and helped with a knife. The two sides each tied at three goals to form a tie. The list of yesterday's game continuation is as follows:

(Rattling Bells) Wei Peiyun, Chen Miaoling, Chen Yushi, Huang Huizhen, Zhang Bihua, Wu Ailian, Yang Mugong.

Weekly Market Commentary

The past ten-plus days seem specially designed for the continuous rise in prices; the suffering of the people's livelihood oppressed by high prices is the same as the invisible erosion of savings due to high prices. Then, after this financial change, should there be another step?

Now, the talk of managing prices and cracking down on speculation is rampant. What will happen in the end? Let's wait for the facts to prove it. But everything is inseparable from the facts. For example, in addition to speculation, there are fundamental factors in supply and demand that cause high prices. But it can be said that if speculation can be eliminated, it will greatly contribute to dispersing the population of this city. Reducing the population is also a way to adjust supply and demand, isn't it?

Retreating to discuss the continuous surge in prices is always related to the quantity of currency in circulation. The intensity of such a continuous surge today is rare even during periods of currency inflation. However, now is the period when savings are being used to recover legal tender at a rate of two to one, which can be said to be in the process of currency contraction. Why does this opposite phenomenon occur? Because banks have stopped accepting legal tender cash deposits, they are circulating between commodity transactions and securities transactions; and extending the process of currency-to-currency exchange invisibly, the contraction rate is offset by the circulation rate.

The higher the currency circulation, the tighter the need for currency. In addition, it is close to the Dragon Boat Festival, so the money market in this city is not relaxed due to currency congestion. Last week, the interbank lending rate of money shops increased from 1.5 cents to 1.7 cents. Although the increase was slight, the attitude was still tight. This is another contradiction.

If hot money withdraws from commodity speculation, where will it go in the future? It is quite interesting. Chinese stocks have already risen, but it is driven by the stimulus of prices. If this factor is lost, then it must wait for a new standard to be discovered before it is possible.

The booming real estate in recent years is one of the reasons for the concentration of population; the excess of hot money is also one of the reasons. The decline in currency value is another reason. How will the objective situation change in the future? The relationship is very important. But when things reach an extreme, they will turn around, and a narrow road can be met. Is this another contradiction with the image of population dispersion?

### Market Dynamics

Government Bonds

Last week, the bond market trend can be described as soaring. Most bonds rose by about ten yuan. Although there were many profit-taking in the middle, the stage remained solid. The lineup on both sides was largely the same as the previous week; however, there were more people taking profits than the previous week. Tongshun, Defu, Hu Heji, and Tongkang are the leaders in this regard. Tongli was still the leader in the continuous decline, but at the beginning of the week, Tongli had mutual entry and exit, which seemed to have shaken its confidence; but looking at its subsequent continuous decline, we can know that it was caused by skills. Those with strong absorption stomachs include Qianyi, Shuntai, Lianhe, Tongyuan, and Changji, etc. The scattered many are also worth noting. The limit up on Thursday was a pioneering initiative after the change of currency units, and its significance is certainly not comparable to ordinary times. The slight return wind on the weekend is also an important embellishment. But the direction of this week is very important. If it is still and still for observation, then the future has great potential.

Foreign Currency

The foreign currency market has been regarded as unpopular. Precisely because of this, it will not be let go. The performance is amazing. Last week, the US dollar pound was close to the 600 yuan mark. The US dollar bill tracked even faster; speaking of the degree: the pound's rise was greater than the gold bill in the previous week; the gold bill's advance last week was faster than the gold pound.

The foothold of the Japanese military ticket is still hard, but the stability of the listing has attracted attention so far. Mid-month is often the peak period of military tickets. What is the current situation? Very interesting.

The trend of Hong Kong tickets is step by step, very tightly tied; the sudden storm on Thursday, the rising momentum is fierce, how can it be the result of steady and steady fighting.

The market price of Chinese stocks was particularly brilliant last week. The continuous surge has not only dispelled the halved impact of changing to the use of savings notes, but has also exceeded the one-to-one ratio and continued to rise sharply. This is the result of the general price increase, which is not surprising. If the price continues to rise, the future of the stock market is unlimited, isn't it also a logical prediction?

At the turn of the semester, cultural stocks are of course popular, with Commercial Press taking the lead, and Zhonghua and World also tracking straight up. Textile stocks follow closely with cloth, never letting go. The pillar of the market, the new medicine stocks, such as New Asia and Sino-French, are both flourishing; for Wuzhou Pharmacy, there are only calls to buy, no calls to sell. It can be described as a rare commodity to be cherished. China Underwear was initially up and then tired, showing a unique feature.

Recently, there has been a popular saying in the market about cracking down on speculation. Once it is realized, the scope of speculation will become narrower, and the only place that can accommodate hot money at that time is probably the Chinese stock market?

Foreign Stocks

Last week, the market price of foreign stocks was stimulated by the crazy rise of Chinese stocks, and they also fought ten times: the intensity of the storm was comparable. Chinese stocks soared in the two days of Tuesday and Wednesday, and foreign stocks soared on Thursday. The rising wind of Chinese stocks continued to be strong, and the rise of foreign stocks stopped as soon as it rose; it can be seen that it has become a bubble nature. Jardine Matheson, which has always been the leader of foreign stocks, has been gloomy recently, and it has returned to youth last week. The lowest price on Wednesday was only 69.5 yuan, and the next day it reached 84.5 yuan, but it quickly returned to 72 yuan on Friday: it is really like a dying old man. Textile foreign stocks do not let China Textiles; rubber stocks are rising in an orderly manner; industrial stocks have mixed fortunes; real estate stocks are moderately sharp. Public utilities stocks are advancing unparalleled, as the head of all stocks. This is a by-product of price increase and changing to the use of standby notes. However, the saying of rectifying the market is now raging; if it is true, foreign stocks may be difficult to escape?

Commodities

Cigarette Market: The prices of all cigarette grades have risen in unison; the intensity of the sharpness is not inferior due to the mold season: it is really rare in history. The market rumored that there was no way to ship the goods, and the factory price was about to increase. In fact, it is using the merger of Japanese cigarette factories. Suspending the distribution of goods and forcibly raising the market price. Moreover, the cigarette market still uses legal tender transactions, and the change of currency units is very common, and speculators will certainly not miss the opportunity. However, the cigarette industry in this city has been controlled. It is not comparable to other free commodities. Recently, the seven major Japanese cigarette factories in Central China (Dongyang, Wuhan Huasheng, Gongcheng, Xingya, Dongya, North China Dongya, Sino-Foreign Industry. The Zhonghua Tobacco Co., Ltd. established by the merger has been established, with capital increased to 31.7 million yuan and owning ten factories (seven in Shanghai and two in Hankou). The annual production capacity has increased to 1.3 million cigarettes, and the future can be imagined. Today's price increase may have two effects: one is to prepare for the 2:1 change to savings note transactions so that it will not lag behind other goods, and the other is that the new company is about to open. When new goods are released, the exit of the households' inventory will be poor, especially in this mold season, why not let me have a good opportunity to sell? Then today's various signs are obviously wanting to let go first and then capture, and it is a scene of capturing and releasing Cao before the new metabolism.

Western Medicine: Western medicine transactions use both new and old currencies, and the prices vary, and the general trend is upward, which is slower than other goods. It is good that the customer sales are on the sidelines, and the regular operators are strictly guarding against the activities of the hoarders; therefore, the market atmosphere is the most normal; in the sound of skyrocketing prices of hundreds of things, only Western medicine is the mainstay, which is really commendable.

Grains: Beans and wheat are listed as prosperous, but the arrival of goods is not smooth, so broad beans are tight and the market is tight, about 20 yuan more than the previous week. The rising trend of soybeans is similar; wheat bran is short of goods and the price is firm; new wheat is like a dragon seeing its head but not its tail, which is caused by strict control. There are about 100 bags of transactions in Wuhu every day, and there are also many shipments in Kunshan; the selling price is about 230 yuan per stone. Although the bottom of red beans is thick, the price is still outstanding.

Oil Cakes: Although the price of groundnut and peanut oil in North China has fallen, the price in this city is particularly firm. Starting from Tuesday, the controlled price of retail edible oil has consistently increased by 2 yuan. The cake market transaction is not lonely, and the market atmosphere is mixed, with fluctuations of about 10 yuan throughout the week.

Candles, Soap, and Matches: Candles, soap, and matches have been following the cigarette market; given the high cigarette prices, candles, soap, and matches are difficult to avoid. Hoarders continue to ignore the control, and relentlessly search for high prices. The prosperity of the market is no less than that of the cigarette market.

Cloth

Continuous surge in prices, not enough; opened at the beginning of the week in the control theory, the width is still rising;

Although the existing yarn also follows the factory list sharply, it is not as good as the factory list, and it falls very late, so the rolling is getting farther and farther. The atmosphere of the piece market is not as good as the yarn market. But at the weekend, the popularity was timid, and there was a difference of 120 yuan between the highest and lowest prices of the whole week.

### Off-Site Tidbits

The authorities of the two phases have levied a 2% retail donation. Since it is called a retail donation, wholesale is naturally tax-free. So how to distinguish between retail and wholesale? If it is divided from the nature of the company, it is not a problem for those who specialize in wholesale or retail, but there are many who engage in both wholesale and retail. If it is divided from the total value of the transaction, that is, taxes are levied under a certain number of yuan, and taxes are exempted above that. But the price of goods varies greatly, and the tax-free point must be specified one by one: but the procedure is too complicated; in my opinion, it is better to divide it from the trading volume of each item, that is, taxes are exempted below the purchase of a certain number of similar items; it is easier. If the two are not distinguished, double tax, triple tax and even unlimited tax will inevitably occur, and the increase in prices will be very impressive. However, the essence of the retail donation, in theory, is not a factor in the current price!

The magic hand of the group is likely to extend to the hardware industry. However, this is military supplies; last week, the Liaison Department of the Asian Academy of the Chinese Academy of Sciences issued a metal mobilization order to Japanese nationals on L. Requisition of copper and iron products, all must be submitted before the end of September. The scope of requisition has been specified.

Science

### Climate Creates Genius

— He Kai

The National Academy of Sciences is the most profound scientific research institution in the United States. Its three hundred members meet every two years to discuss the latest discoveries in the scientific community. At the last conference, members heard the startling news that genius is created by climate. The theory was proposed by Professor Peterson of the University of Illinois.

After examining "Who's Who in America," "Dictionary of American Biography," "Who's Who in Germany," and "American Men of Science," Dr. Peterson collected data on 25,000 celebrities. He compared the records of these people with the records of madmen and prisoners.

Their birthdays were said to be irrelevant, but he paid close attention to the approximate dates of their conception.

His statistics show that people conceived in the first half of the year have more unusual minds than others: these people include more geniuses and more madmen.

Applying this rule to 31 American presidents, he found that 16 presidents (including Washington, Lincoln, Wilson, and Roosevelt) were conceived before July. Only five presidents (including Taft, Coolidge, and Hoover) were conceived in October, November, and December.

Dr. Peterson believes that this is neither due to the arrangement of planets as astrologers say, nor is it affected by any mysterious influence; it is just the climate that is at work.

In the Northern Hemisphere, the first half of the year is the storm season, which affects the mother and the fetus, which is most sensitive in the first few weeks of pregnancy. Conception in the relatively calm and storm-free autumn will produce a balanced, normal, and gentle child. And in the spring, it is easy to produce geniuses and abnormal children as well as people prone to mental illness.

### Exploring the Secrets of the Deep Sea

— Star Flower

Decades ago, people generally believed that animals could not survive at all in the deep sea. Later, after many scientists used equipment to collect specimens of deep-sea animals, it was discovered that this was not the case. They found that fish, clams, and crustaceans, and even soft-bodied sea anemones, can live three miles below the surface of the sea.

In the deep sea, sunlight cannot penetrate, yet many animals have eyes. We might guess that they never have the chance to use their eyes from birth to death because in absolute darkness, nothing can be seen. We know that cats can see in the dark because even in the deep of night, there is always some light, and their eyeballs concentrate that light. However, in the completely dark deep sea, such eyes are useless. Fortunately, many fish in the seabed can emit phosphorescence throughout their bodies, with light emanating from the mucus on their skin. Fish are curious, especially about shiny things, so fishermen often tie tin foil to hooks to lure and catch them. Also, some luminescent fish can use their glowing spines, waving them in front of their mouths when hungry to attract small fish nearby, which they then catch and devour. However, these fish are also often eaten by their close relatives—the frogfish (also fish), which specialize in catching fish, and are not easily caught near the surface. When captured, they are immediately dissected, and their stomachs have been found to contain as many as seventy-five herring. Another had swallowed fifteen flounders before its death.

Deep-sea eels can also swallow prey larger than themselves. Their jaws, like those of snakes, are particularly wide, and their throats and bodies are elastic. When brought to the surface, the stomach of the first eel contained a curled-up animal three times its length. The second concealed a victim five times its own weight. Another had eaten so much that it almost dislocated its fins. This world is a world where big fish eat little fish.

Deep-sea animals must endure incredible pressure. We live under air equal in height to the sea, and there is already fifteen pounds of pressure per square inch! Not to mention water. Therefore, even experienced divers cannot reach depths of more than three hundred feet below the surface. Yet fish can withstand this pressure of more than two and a half tons—equivalent to twenty-five times the force of a speeding train. This seems impossible, but there are many animals living on the seabed! This question still awaits a solution. We can answer it this way: because their body tissues are very brittle, it is difficult to move without a large amount of water to support them. Gases are stored or dissolved in their swim bladders and blood, equalizing pressure from all directions. Sometimes, when they rise from their original position, the external pressure decreases, and the internal pressure forces the internal organs towards the mouth, and the eyeballs protrude from their sockets. Their shape becomes different from what it was originally, so they lie on the deep seabed and do not dare to swim upwards.

Life

### Friendship

— Li Quan

The establishment or deepening of friendship often involves shared interests and views, but beyond coordination in life practice, it often cannot maintain lasting friendship. To maintain friendship permanently, like from first love to lifelong commitment, from passionate love to growing old together, deep affection and understanding of life's practice are necessary, and it must be cultivated constantly.

Such cultivation of friendship is no different from cultivating a thriving flower! The most terrible friendship in the world is when friendship is misused and treated as a commodity. You are free to abuse friendship, but friendship is not like dog meat. If we measure friendship with utilitarianism, then it is over, everything is over.

Between each other, can we be frank with each other? Will frankness destroy friendship?

No, it will never happen. Frankness only enhances mutual friendship, but frankness is limited to not harming the dignity of each other's way of life. Everyone should be tolerant of honest criticism from others. The starting point of all criticism comes from truly caring for us, and we have absolutely no reason to refuse it. We should even thank those who criticize us frankly.

However, we must be wary of petty people in the world, who can hinder our courage in work and life. There are also those who, after hearing a slightly unfavorable remark about us from others, generously tell us the truth. These are also disloyal friends and even dangerous. The reason they do this is because of how others told them, and they want to gain self-satisfaction from it.

Human Sentiments

### Indians Who Value Etiquette

— Shi Dong

Indians place great emphasis on etiquette; within this etiquette seems to contain an unexpected element of mystery to us.

For example, when they receive an invitation, the first thing they must do is call the barber from the town where the person who issued the invitation lives to get a haircut. If it is a wedding invitation, the barber must also instruct the invited guest on various necessary rituals.

When the inviter is a noble, the barber must visit each of the invited guests, show them the entire list of guests, and the list must be signed by each person. It can be seen that the barber in India is an indispensable figure in social circles.

Men and women never go to banquets together. They act completely separately.

Women arrive at the venue in vehicles with covered surroundings. Upon arrival, the greeter will loudly announce the arrival of the female guest and lead them into the ladies' room. At this time, it is said to be extremely impolite to call out the woman's name.

Male guests are led into a large living room, where carpets are laid, waiting for the distribution of the feast. The dishes at Indian wedding feasts are always the same. That is a plate of potato soup and bread baked with meat, milk, and cream.

The food is placed on the ground, and everyone squats down to eat.

Whether eating or drinking, they avoid using their left hand. Using the left hand to eat will be seen as barbaric.

### Doctors and Patients

— Yu Xin'en

(4) Self-Help and Mutual Aid

In these extremely difficult times, the most practical method is self-help and mutual aid. In this atmosphere of hoarding medicine, if you unfortunately fall ill, just the cost of medication is considerable. To avoid this misfortune, it is best to maintain good health. To maintain good health, nothing is more important than diet, daily life, and hygiene. These may seem insignificant, but they actually occupy a major position. If we eat properly and sleep adequately, at least our original resistance will not drop to the point where we cannot prevent diseases. Adequate sleep requires no cost and does not require adding even a drop of water. Although the cost of food has risen considerably, we can save in other areas and not plan on saving on meals, just to avoid getting sick. In the past, only a portion of our income was used for meals, while the rest was for clothing, social activities, entertainment, appearances, and many other items. Now, we have to redistribute the use of our income. By reducing other areas and practicing a frugal lifestyle, we can have more savings on food, which is more protection for our own health.

In addition, the implementation of a proper health insurance system is also necessary for the purpose of self-help and mutual aid. Everyone contributes a very small amount of money within their capacity, which together can become a large sum of money that can be used for the medical expenses of those who unfortunately fall ill. If you don't get sick this year, that is your great fortune. Your small amount of money can be used to help those who unfortunately get sick, so that they don't have to sit and wait for death because of their own financial difficulties. Similarly, if you yourself get sick, you can also enjoy the same rights. We might as well implement this principle. On a small scale, we can gather dozens of families to allocate a certain amount of money for emergency medical use. It's not that you lose out if you don't get sick this month, but that you have helped others. In these times, the most practical strategy is self-help and mutual aid.

Doctors and patients are both striving towards the path of health, from disease to health; but let us go further, which is to prevent disease and maintain health! (End)

### Self-Preservation Strategies of Weak Animals

— Jian Nong

Weak animals live in this world, which is a battlefield of the survival of the fittest, where the strong live and the weak die. It's like when we humans encounter a chaotic world. To eke out a living, they must resort to unique skills or clever tactics. In addition to the "camouflage" we talked about before, most of which can be included in this exception, let's pick a few common ones to discuss.

Swift Feet

If a weak animal is unlucky enough to encounter a major enemy, the simplest way to deal with it is to be afraid and stay away—the thirty-six stratagems. Running is the best strategy! As the people of Beiping say: "Sir! You're powerful? I won't mess with you!" But to run, you have to be able to run. Of course, you need a pair of "swift feet" that move like flying clouds and lightning. Look at the wild rabbits that run as fast as an arrow leaving a bow, the zebras that seem to have wings, and the red deer and antelopes that dart through the mountains and leap over streams as easily as walking on flat ground and disappear in the blink of an eye. These are some of the most common examples. If we try to find a few ancient people to compare them to, would it be inappropriate? I think they are somewhat like Guan You'an, who fled to Liaodong to avoid disaster, or Zhu Shunshui, who went into exile overseas.

Freeing Oneself

Locusts or fleas rely on a pair of very strong and powerful spring-like legs to escape. When they see that things are not right, they jump high into the sky, giving you no chance to catch them! This ability to "free oneself" during a moment of extreme danger is somewhat like Han Fengmeng, who resigned from his official position and returned home, or Jin Zhang Han, who abandoned his official post and returned to Wu, isn't it?

High Seclusion

There is a type of sponge called "together in old age, together in the grave"—or Aphrodite's Flower Basket—its shape resembling a bamboo tube, covered with countless columnar and porous ossicles, snow-white in color, like a net woven with silver threads. Because its body structure is inedible for large fish, a loving couple—the shrimp, often live carefree in its hollow cavity. That is the reason it is called "together in old age, together in the grave." I would like to compare this little couple to Liang Hong and Meng Guang, who shared a cart.

Deep Concealment

Earthworms, which eat soil above and drink from the Yellow Springs below, and moles, whose movements are slow and whose eyesight is dim, have no place to use their skills in this world, so they have to retreat and bury their heads deep underground. Even the armadillo, which wears armor and looks quite heroic, uses its front paws, which are sharper than iron shovels, to quickly dig into the ground with a few digs, as if it had the earth-burrowing skills of Sun Shihang! This behavior of deeply concealing oneself to seek self-preservation can also be seen in Shen Tu Pan, who built houses from trees, or Li Erqu, who hid in earthen rooms.

Self-Defilement

Some animals, in order to save their lives, do not hesitate to use the means of "self-defilement" to achieve their goals. For example, mud worms cover their bodies with dung, froghoppers surround themselves with foam, stink bugs emit a foul odor, and many other animals spit out stinky water and release foul gas. They seem to be saying to their pursuers, "I am not edible, I dare not trouble you, please look for other delicacies!" This pitiful means of avoiding disaster cannot help but remind people of Sikong Tu, who lost his composure, and Tang Bohu, who pretended to be mad and naked!

### Mobile "Telephoto Photography" Vehicle

— Shen Xiong

Telephoto photography is a new and emerging novelty, which has been quite developed in recent years, especially in the United Kingdom and the United States. However, news has come that its inventor, Mr. Bowen, has passed away at the young age of thirty-seven. Telephoto photography captures the past activities of people, while telephoto photography allows us to see the activities on the spot, which adds an extra layer of intimacy. Radio can only allow us to hear the sound. With telephoto photography, we can see the person and hear them. The development of science has realized many of the fantasies of years ago. The picture shows the mobile telephoto photography vehicle of the National Broadcasting Company of the United States. The section on the left is where the photographer takes pictures and records sound, and the section on the right is equipped with an antenna to handle the transmission work.

### Sharing the Same Boat Through Storms

— He Jia Zhi

The Sixth Day's Counting

After three or four days, Weicheng counted the days every day, thinking that Sister Cuizhen might be back. Sometimes, when he occasionally thought of Huanglong, he felt that Huanglong was a person who appeared and disappeared unpredictably. He didn't want him to come, but he suddenly came. He hoped he would come, but he simply didn't come. Weicheng's thoughts about Huanglong were only occasional; occasional things faded away after a while. He was in the bedroom, wanting to take a nap, but as soon as he lay down, he felt that a nap was pointless. It wasn't the scorching summer season. He walked to the Shuangmei Study, flipped through a few volumes of ancient poetry, but couldn't read it for more than ten minutes. He went out blankly, seeing dark clouds gathering in the sky, suggesting rain. He thought, that's right, Qingming Festival is coming soon. As the saying goes, it drizzles during the Qingming Festival, probably the heavens are already preparing for Qingming. The spring breeze gently blew up his light gray cloth gown under his feet; at the same time, it blew in from under his trouser legs. He hadn't been in contact with nature for many days, and nature had already changed. In the sun, the wheat leaves were lush and vibrant, completely covering the soil under the stalks. When a gust of wind came, the wheat leaves rose and fell together like waves, flashing the beauty that painters could not paint.

Weicheng temporarily forgot that he was in mourning, strolling along, facing the spring breeze towards the east. He was thinking that if it rained, it would only be a drizzle, a needle-like drizzle, pricking his face, giving him some painless and itchy stimulation, which would be a form of entertainment. As he walked along, he saw Xu Quanfu and He Zixing kneading mud on the boat. This silt, which had settled at the bottom of the river, could be used as fertilizer for enriching the fields when mixed, a method of enrichment passed down from ancient times. Weicheng did not object to using silt as fertilizer. He then asked from the shore, "You two are here, where's Axing?" He Zixing said, "Axing is at the cemetery, Da Taitai's new grave. Last time, the soil wasn't piled up very high. Axing has been making the grave for two days." Weicheng nodded and continued east. He Zixing said, "Young master, it might rain soon, where are you going?" Weicheng didn't turn around, just raised his hand high above his shoulder and waved, indicating that it was okay. (102)
