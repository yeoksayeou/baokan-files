### Rumor That the Soviet Union Has Ordered the Detention of Important Turkish Figures

Istanbul, 5th (Havas News Agency dispatch) It is rumored here that the Soviet government has ordered the arrest of important Turkish figures.

### Large-Scale Air Defense Drill in Sweden

Stockholm, 6th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) A large-scale air raid drill was held here on Thursday night, with 20,000 people participating. The food supply equipment used in wartime was also used for the first time.

Stockholm, 5th (Havas News Agency dispatch) On the 21st of last month, several German aircraft flew over Swedish airspace near Gothenburg. The Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiment fired at them. The General Confederation of Labor expressed its dissatisfaction with this, and on the 4th, issued a declaration scolding the government and threatening to no longer serve the country's defense plan. The declaration was jointly signed by 1,000 people in Rieshiri Harbour. (Note: There is an artillery factory in the harbor.) The contents of the declaration are as follows: "On the 31st of last month, many German aircraft flew over Rieshiri Harbour. At that time, there were eleven Swedish warships anchored in the nearby waters, and the visibility was very good. The German aircraft flew very low, and it would have been possible to shoot at them with anti-aircraft guns without harming civilians. The authorities did not attempt to do this. What is the purpose? It is really puzzling. Whether this policy will be seen again in the future is also a source of anxiety. If the government continues to maintain this attitude, it will inevitably cause national dissatisfaction, and the result will be that the national defense bond fundraising campaign will be completely paralyzed. We hope the government will take this as a warning."

### Wind and Sand Subside Slightly, Heat Rises Again; The Situation in the North African War is Still Chaotic; In the Desert Area, the British Divide into Three War Zones and Set Up Fortress Lines to Defend Egypt

Headquarters of the German Leader, 6th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) This afternoon's German military report stated that in North Africa, the German and Italian Allied forces repelled the attacking British forces and launched a counteroffensive. Thirty-six British tanks and many motorcycles were lost, and hundreds of prisoners were taken. Ten enemy aircraft were shot down. Last night, Tobruk Harbor was fiercely bombed by Heinkel bombers.

Rome, 6th (Domei News Agency dispatch) Since the German and Italian forces launched a major offensive against the British mechanized units in the Shahan area south of Tobruk on the 27th of last month, fierce fighting has continued. Because the area is a unique desert area, the purpose of this operation is not to occupy the territory, but to destroy the strength of the enemy forces. This is a very obvious fact. As for the US defense organization of Egypt, it is rumored from neutral countries that the British army is using the desert area south of Tobruk as the first war zone, the north-south line passing through Bardia as the second war zone, and the north-south line passing through Sidi Barrani as the third war zone, laying small fortresses in various areas, and landmines are buried in the open space between the fortresses. As of now, the war results of the German and Italian forces are estimated to be more than 3,000 enemy prisoners, and more than 100 enemy tanks and many cannons have been captured or destroyed.

Berlin, 5th (Domei News Agency dispatch) The German News Agency in Rome reported that Axis fast boat teams sank a British destroyer in the sea off Tobruk, North Africa.

Stockholm, 6th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) A report in London was carried in the newspapers here, saying that a visitor from Cairo reported that, as of last night, the desert warfare in North Africa was quieter than in the past few days. Both sides are using the period of major military contact to prepare for battle. The British report stated that Bir Hakeim is still in the hands of the British army, the wind and sand have subsided slightly, and the heat has risen again. Future battles are feared to be hotter than before.

Somewhere on the Libyan Front Line, 5th (Havas News Agency dispatch) The war situation on the North African front line is still extremely chaotic, and both sides' war reports are very evasive. The British communique only mentioned the fighting near the Hakeim area, saying that its reinforcements had arrived there to assist the garrison in combat. The fierce new offensive by the Heinkel Axis forces is being studied. The Hakeim area is now the center of the battle. Over the past 48 hours, the Heinkel forces have launched large-scale offensives there no less than twice. There is now every reason to believe that fighting is also taking place west of Gazala. The German forces are obviously attempting to attack both ends of the British line of defense in order to relieve the pressure on the central area. The German and Italian Allied forces in this area have already torn a gap in the British lines, and ammunition and reinforcements are arriving at the front line through this gap. As for the minefield area, the fighting has not stopped, especially west of Knightsbridge. Knightsbridge is a strategically important area, which the British call "Hell's Gate." In addition, the weather conditions on the front line are extremely bad, and it is difficult for tank soldiers to endure without iron and steel bones. The British believe that Heinkel forces commander Rommel will do everything possible to allow his reinforcements to pass through the gap and launch a full-scale eastward offensive. Rommel still has a large number of troops to deploy, so he is still very formidable. The only thing the British can be optimistic about is that their armored forces are as strong as ever and can deal with the enemy forces to the end.

### Roosevelt Has Signed the Declaration of War Against Bulgaria and Hungary

Argentina, 6th (Domei News Agency dispatch) According to a report from Washington, after the US Congress and Senate passed the declaration of war against Bulgaria, Romania, and Hungary, it was signed into law by President Roosevelt yesterday.

Washington, 5th (Havas News Agency dispatch) President Roosevelt announced a declaration today, stating that a state of war exists between the United States and Bulgaria, Romania, and Hungary.

Berlin, 6th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) When the German Foreign Ministry entertained journalists yesterday, Minister Stone answered a question about the US declaration of war against Bulgaria, Romania, and Hungary, saying, "When Bulgaria, Romania, and Hungary declared war on the US in accordance with Article 3 of the Tripartite Pact, Roosevelt used the Constitution as a shield and waited for the decision of Congress. The recent US declaration of war against Bulgaria, Romania, and Hungary only confirms his attitude towards the new Europe. Hungary and Romania are actively participating in the war against the Soviet Union, and Bulgaria is taking measures to eliminate Bolshevism at home."

### Large Explosion on the Norwegian Border; Violent Vibrations Everywhere Like an Earthquake

Stockholm, 6th (Domei News Agency dispatch) A violent explosion occurred in Norway on Wednesday and Thursday of last week, lasting for 24 hours. It shook the Skien district and even Gothenburg at the southernmost tip of the Swedish coast. The violent situation was like an earthquake. The cause is unknown, but it is known that the Skien district is only 20 miles away from Norway's largest armaments factory (located in Kolsberg).

Stockholm, 5th (Havas News Agency dispatch) A violent explosion suddenly occurred last night in a certain area on the border between Sweden and Norway, that is, in the area north of the city of Gothenburg. It was probably caused by bombs dropped by aircraft. At that time, residents also heard the sound of airplane engines.

### Finnish Leader Meets with German Leader on Military Matters: Large-Scale Offensive Expected Near Murmansk

A Havas dispatch from Berlin, dated June 6th: A Foreign Ministry official stated yesterday that the meeting between the German leader and Finnish Commander-in-Chief, General Mannerheim, has been met with a friendly response from the German people. This visit to Finland by the leader is devoid of diplomatic formalities, leading officials to believe that it represents a new model for relations among European nations. The new Europe does not differentiate treatment based on the size of a nation's territory, and the German people are deeply moved by the Finnish people's commendable efforts in participating in the war.

A Havas dispatch from Stockholm, dated June 6th: London newspapers are speculating on Hitler's visit to Finland, suggesting that the talks between the German leader and Finnish leaders likely concern military matters. It is feared that German-Finnish forces will launch an offensive on the Murmansk front. A newspaper article published last night pointed out that the German leader's visit to Finland coincides with renewed military activity on the Leningrad front. It is difficult for outsiders to determine whether the German-Finnish forces will attack Murmansk or Leningrad. However, many commentators believe that a large-scale German-Finnish offensive on the Murmansk front is more likely. If so, there is a risk that US-Finnish relations will deteriorate. However, a dispatch from New York indicates that the US government does not intend to sever ties with Finland, and many in Congress still express sympathy for Finland.

A Havas dispatch from Stockholm, dated June 5th: Local newspapers today commented on German leader Hitler's visit to Finnish Commander-in-Chief General Mannerheim, generally considering it a friendly visit that will not fundamentally change Finland's position. However, considering that General Keitel and German Commander in Finland, General Dietl, accompanied the German leader, important talks must have taken place. Furthermore, Hitler's personal congratulations to General Mannerheim prove Germany's appreciation for Finnish cooperation, and it is evident that Finland will not make a separate peace with the Soviet Union. In the future, Finland will undoubtedly not avoid participating in the war against the Soviet Union. However, it is undeniable that in recent months, the Finnish army has avoided participating in the Soviet offensive, limiting its actions to defending existing strategic strongholds. General Mannerheim has repeatedly stated that Finland is engaged in a defensive war and reiterated that its war aim is solely to prevent the Soviet annexation of Finland, thus deciding to advance to easily defended borders. There is reason to believe that this view has not changed, its will is firm, and its determination that its democratic politics not be interfered with by foreign countries is consistent. It is doubtful whether Finland intends to conclude a military alliance with Sweden. Furthermore, Finland is unwilling to worsen its relations with the United States, let alone declare war on the United States. Therefore, any actions that could harm Finnish-American diplomatic relations will be avoided. Finland's reluctance to cut off the Murmansk railway is motivated by this, as doing so would cut off the supply route from Britain and the United States to the Soviet Union, which would be tantamount to going to war with the United States. Therefore, Finland will likely maintain its current attitude, continue to adopt a defensive posture, and allow German forces to occupy their objectives on the Finnish front. Strategically, if the port of Murmansk falls, the Soviet threat to Finland in that area will be completely eliminated. If Leningrad also falls, Finland will consider the war to be over. Although Finland may not immediately cease military operations from a technical standpoint, the army could be demobilized, and young men could return to farming to solve the country's increasingly serious food shortage.

### Commander of Danish Volunteer Corps Killed in Action

A Havas dispatch from Copenhagen, dated June 6th: It was announced here yesterday that the commander of the Danish Volunteer Corps, Schalburg (46 years old), was killed in action on the Eastern Front on June 2nd. German Ambassador Fink has already informed the Danish government of this news. The production of charcoal gas and other items such as alcohol, electricity, and coal gas is very active. In addition, metal products are extremely scarce, especially copper, which is often replaced by aluminum. Fabrics are scarce, and artificial silk is used as a substitute. Domestic laboratories have been working diligently recently and have achieved remarkable results, discovering many new materials. However, under the current circumstances, it is not possible to fully implement them at this time.

### Vichy Cabinet Passes Universal Economic Control: Government Begins to Develop Neglected Resources

A Havas dispatch from Vichy, dated June 5th: The cabinet held a state council meeting at 10:30 this morning, presided over by Marshal P√©tain. First, Laval reported on the general situation. The state council then discussed the issue of food for the people, making slight revisions to the methods of controlling essential foods in order to alleviate public hardship. Justice Minister Barth√©lemy requested the enactment of laws to severely punish officials responsible for preserving food who are negligent or intentionally allow food to spoil. Finally, the following two proposals were passed: The Ministry of National Defense proposed establishing general economic control, advocating for the establishment of a committee chaired by Police Commissioner General Bels. The Minister of Public Health, Grasset, proposed improving French health affairs.

A Havas dispatch from Clermont-Ferrand, dated June 5th:

French import trade has been interrupted, making it impossible to obtain needed goods from overseas. In addition, the country is scarred by war, and due to the defeat, various industrial raw materials are on the verge of exhaustion. In order to cope with this situation, the government has begun to develop resources, especially focusing on certain resources that have been neglected in the past. This self-sufficient economic policy can alleviate France's raw material shortage. For example, some coal mines that were abandoned in the past due to their small output are now being re-mined due to the coal shortage in various regions. In addition, several other coal mines, such as those in Saint-√âtienne, Al√®s, and Marseille, were previously ignored by the authorities due to poor quality or difficult mining, but are now being actively developed. As for gasoline substitutes, the current monthly output is 36,000 tons, and it is expected to increase to 50,000 tons this year, equivalent to one-sixth of pre-war consumption. Various vehicles are using

### Sevastopol Fortress Bombed

Several enemy units in the central and northern sectors have been encircled and are being increasingly pressured. On the Volkhov front, German dive bombers assisted the army in driving back the resisting enemy. Twenty-two enemy tanks were lost. German warships fired on and hit a Soviet submarine in the Finnish Gulf. The submarine was hit several times and appears to have sunk.

### US Vice President Rumored to Visit Britain, Possibly with a Trip to Southern Ireland

A dispatch from the German News Agency in Geneva, dated June 5th: The "Daily Mail" carried a New York news report stating that US Vice President Wallace may visit Britain and Ireland this summer. The purpose of this trip would be to reach some understanding with the Valera government regarding naval bases in Southern Ireland. Wallace's discussions in Dublin are not expected to yield immediate results, but it is generally believed that in the near future, Southern Ireland may heed advice and allow the Allied powers to use its bases.

A Havas dispatch from Lisbon, dated June 6th: Due to a prolonged drought in the first half of May, forest fires have broken out in various parts of the US East Coast. Authorities at the time believed that the fires were due to sabotage. Rhode Island suffered the greatest losses, with fifty square miles of forest burned.

A Havas dispatch from Stockholm, Sweden, dated June 5th: It has been learned that as a result of the British air raid on the city of Cologne, Germany, on the evening of the 29th of last month, the city suffered extremely heavy losses. The Cologne Daily News did not publish the situation of the bombing until the 4th of this month (note that the newspaper office has been bombed). It is said that during the British air raid on Cologne that night, nine churches were destroyed or severely damaged, including the famous St. Martin and St. Mary churches. Historical buildings from hundreds of years ago have been reduced to rubble. Many houses have been destroyed, and world-famous historical sites have also been bombed.

In the first five years of the construction plan, priority will be given to constructing transportation routes between Lopburi and other important cities, as well as building waterways. The water conservancy project cost is determined to be 2 million baht.

### French Concession Organizes Ba–æjia Preparatory Committee: Personnel Designated to Establish Central Ba–æjia Preparatory Committee; Ba–æjia Preparatory Subcommittees Established in Each Police District

In order to implement the provisions of Consular Decree No. 163 regarding the organization of Ba–æjia in the French Concession, the French Consul General issued Decree No. 184 on May 31, designating the following individuals to establish the Central Ba–æjia Preparatory Committee:

List of Committee Members: Chairman: Representative of the French Consul General; Vice Chairman: Father Mouly; Committee Members: Liu Xingxun (Manager of Yu Salt Trading Company, No. 9 Quai de France), Ge Wei'an (Chairman of Seafood Traders Association, No. 12 Zhoushan Road), Yu Yongsui (Manager of Shicheng Company, No. 456 Avenue Joffre), Zhang Renzhong (Owner of Xin Salt Store, No. 22 Rue Corneille), Yu Zhijing (General Manager of Huifu Industrial Company, No. 6 Lane 441 Route Conty), Zhang Shankun (Manager of Zhonglian Film Company, No. 543 Route Haig), Wu Zhesheng (Manager of Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory, No. 1102 Route Zikawei), Salel (Deputy Director of Medical Inspection Office), Messeck (Deputy Inspector of Police Department), Ju Yu (Chief Inspector of Police Department), Marlon (Chief Inspector of Police Department).

Establishment of Subcommittees:

The committee is responsible for discussing various topics submitted by the Director of the Consular Police Department for research. In addition, in each police district, based on the Director's proposal, Ba–æjia preparatory subcommittees of nine people (including Westerners) are established to assist the Chief of Police during the Ba–æjia preparation period. Once the work of the Central Ba–æjia Preparatory Committee and the subcommittees is completed, they will be abolished in accordance with Article 4 of Consular Decree No. 163, promulgated on May 20, 1942. This decree (No. 184) is to be implemented by the Director of the Police Department.

### Central Farmer Bank Notes Continue to Circulate

The banknotes of the Central Farmer Bank are not included in the scope of exchangeable reserve certificates according to regulations. However, the amount of Central Farmer Bank notes circulating among the people is enormous. In order to prevent the public from suffering significant losses, it is rumored that separate handling methods will be announced. As a result, some money exchange shops in the market have suddenly started buying Central Farmer Bank notes, leading to the emergence of a black market. It is reported that the price of Central Farmer Bank notes in the black market is about 85 yuan of banknotes from the Central, China, and Communications Banks for every 100 yuan.

According to the English-language Shanghai Times, according to Mr. Duclaux, the general manager of the French Concession Electricity and Tramway Company, yesterday (the 5th), trams, trolleybuses, and buses of the company now accept auxiliary coin notes from the Central Farmer Bank, as well as 1-yuan, 5-yuan, and 10-yuan old French currency from the Central, China, and Communications Banks. Mr. Duclaux explained that the company is able to accept these banknotes because it has agreed on an agreement with the Reserve Bank in advance. It is said that this method is temporary and can be abolished at any time.

Finally, according to Mr. Duclaux's statement to the North China Daily News, the acceptance of auxiliary coin notes from the Central Farmer Bank on trams in the French Concession failed yesterday (the 5th) after a day of trial due to passengers' refusal to accept them. When the reporter asked whether ticket sellers also refused to accept Central Farmer Bank corner notes, he replied that these corner notes were allowed to be accepted in principle, but were difficult to implement in practice. Because ticket sellers could accept them, but the public refused to accept them, ticket sellers ultimately had to refuse to accept them as well. As a result, Central Farmer Bank corner notes are completely unusable on French trams, but it is reported that 1-yuan, 5-yuan, and 10-yuan banknotes from the Central, China, and Communications Banks are indeed being accepted.

### Money Exchange Houses Increase Interest Rates on Deposits and Loans to Curb Speculation and Hoarding, Lower Prices, Promote Savings, and Develop Industry and Commerce

Money exchange houses have recently agreed to increase interest rates on deposits and loans in order to curb market speculation, eliminate hoarding of goods, and assist the authorities in stabilizing prices. The funds needed by speculators and hoarders all rely on loans from money exchange houses. Now, the interest rates on loans such as credit mortgages and overdrafts are increased, making it impossible for them to arbitrarily hoard goods again. At the same time, the interest rates on deposits such as fixed-term, current, and savings accounts are increased, with the aim of promoting savings and cultivating national thrift, so that the deposits received by money exchange houses can be used for legitimate purposes that are beneficial to social development, industrial development, and market recovery. The above methods will be implemented at the beginning of the second half of the year after being approved by the money exchange houses.

### Rice Shops to Sell Foreign Rice Today, Switching to Reserve Certificates

The total number of bags of foreign rice sold by rice shops in the two concessions today is over 10,000, so the sales situation should be widespread. The amount per person is still one and a half liters, sold for 7 yuan and 6 jiao in French currency or 3 yuan and 8 jiao in Central Reserve Bank certificates. However, the Municipal Council has announced that from today onwards, payment should be made in Central Reserve Bank certificates, and rice shops will inevitably refuse to accept French currency. The payment from rice shops to the Rice and Grain Office will also be completely changed to Central Reserve Bank certificates from today.

According to the English-language North China Daily News, the chief translator of the Japanese Consulate General informed reporters that a major change has taken place in the evacuation plan for Allied nationals. The 650 Americans and Canadians leaving Shanghai this month will only be transported by the Conte Verde, and will not be divided between two ships as planned. The list of the first batch of evacuees is not yet complete, and there are several points that must be considered. He also confirmed that the ship's sailing schedule has not been delayed, and the Swiss Consulate cannot provide a list of evacuees. The luxurious Italian ocean liner Conte Verde, which has been docked in Shanghai since the beginning of the European war, has now been painted gray in preparation for sailing. The Japanese flag has also been painted on the ship's hull, and a white cross has been painted on the funnel, bow, and stern. According to the previous plan, two evacuee ships were to transport British and American nationals to Portuguese East Africa for exchange with Japanese nationals. Now, the plan has been changed to one ship, the Conte Verde, and the evacuation of British officials and civilians has been postponed.

### Execution of Condemned Criminals to Continue Tomorrow: Robbers Yin Songqing and Ling Yangsheng Executed Yesterday

After Xie Jin'an, a criminal sentenced to death by the First Special District Court of the Public Concession, was transferred to the Nanshi District Court Detention Center for execution by hanging the day before yesterday, the District Court Prosecutor's Office inspected the execution ground yesterday morning. Since no family members claimed the body, it was collected and buried by the Tongren Fuyuantang Funeral Team. At 10:30 AM, the First Special District Court continued to transfer two criminals sentenced to death, robber Yin Songxiang (also known as Yin Da Ermazi) and robber-murderer Ling Yangsheng, to the same execution ground for execution. The two criminals were brought before the case and asked about their age and origin. Ling requested that the court arrange for burial and did not want to notify his family to collect the body, while Yin stated that his relative Huang Zhengxian lived at No. 391, opposite the Guangyi Central Hospital on Route Roberts, and asked to borrow 200 yuan from Yang Zhenghe to purchase a coffin for the District Court to collect the body, and to notify his wife and daughters in his hometown in the autumn. After the statements were completed, they were tied up and executed by hanging, and notices were posted. It is reported that four more criminals will be executed next Monday, and that several of the 23 people sentenced to death by the First Special District Court are female criminals, who will also be executed there.

Executions Yesterday Morning

Two notorious robbers sentenced to death and awaiting execution have been executed by the Shanghai District Court Detention Center since the order was given. The day before yesterday, the Public Concession Police escorted robber-murderer Xie Jin'an for execution by hanging. Yesterday morning, Yin Songqing (also known as Chen Baoji, alias Chen Da Mazi, 54 years old), a native of Jiangbei, and Ling Yangsheng, 36 years old, a native of Jiangbei, were also executed. Yin Songqing kidnapped Xiang Yixin, the owner of a foundry, on August 3, 1937, with the intention of extorting a ransom. When the extortion failed, he shot Xiang Yixin to death. Ling Yangsheng robbed Chen Jvsheng of 800 yuan in cash at the intersection of Penang Road and Gordon Road at 10:00 AM on July 10, 1936, and shot Chen to death. Both were arrested, interrogated, and sentenced to death, and detained in prison awaiting execution. Yesterday morning, the police brought Yin and Ling from the prison and asked if they had any last words. Yin Songqing sent a letter to his uncle Wang Zhengyan at No. 391, opposite the Guangyi Central Hospital on Route Roberts, asking him to purchase a 200-yuan coffin to collect the body and to notify his family after the autumn. Ling Yangsheng said that he had no last words. Yin and Ling were then escorted by the police to the Shanghai District Court Detention Center for execution by hanging.

It has now appointed banks and money houses in the city to act as agents for collecting and exchanging old currency for new legal tender. The preparations are largely complete, and the exchange is scheduled to begin fully on the 8th. The consolidation work will inevitably become more busy.

### Young Girl with Epilepsy Collapses on Roadside, Severely Injured from Father's Beating

On the 20th of last month, a young woman was found lying on the roadside at the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Avenue Hoche, foaming at the mouth and on the verge of death. A patrolling officer discovered her, reported it to the police station, and sent an ambulance to Guangci Hospital. After examination by a doctor, the woman was found to have swelling and severe injuries to her lower body, indicating that she had been beaten. She remained unconscious for days and unable to speak. It wasn't until the afternoon of the day before yesterday that she was able to speak. She claimed her name was Feng Aidi, 20 years old, and lived in a half-room opposite No. 13, Xiaoliu Family Residence, Zhaozhu Church Road. Her father's name was Feng Yunchu, 53 years old, from Wuxi, who used to be a tailor but recently became a peddler due to unemployment. Her mother, nee Li, passed away last year. Recently, she was often brutally beaten by her father, resulting in injuries all over her body.

This was discovered by detectives from the French Concession Police, who arrested Liu and the other three, recovered the stolen money, and brought them to the police station for investigation. They were charged with receiving stolen goods, interrogated, and then detained pending further investigation.

### The American Dramatic Club (A.D.C.) in Shanghai Presents "Richard III" (Continued)

‚Äî White Bear

According to scholars of Shakespeare's works, "Richard III" belongs to the category of historical tragedies, also known as "Free Will Tragedies." This is a progressive marker in Shakespeare's later works. His "Romeo and Juliet" is also a tragedy, but he places the cause of the tragedy on "fate," while in the later tragedies, Shakespeare attributes the fault of the characters to their nature‚Äîthat is, the weakness of will, flawed thinking, and perverse behavior of the tragic figures themselves. As a result, they are plagued by their conscience, regret, hate themselves, and even become dejected. Perhaps this can be a reference for the audience.

Of course, Shakespeare's Richard III is definitely not the Richard III of English history. Historians may be overly serious, or, to put it nicely, they have an academic style, so they are hesitant to make a definite judgment on Richard II's shortcomings. However, Shakespeare's basis is sufficient: he wants to depict a "villainous hero" hated by the people, not necessarily Richard III. Because such a person exists in humanity, he honestly concentrates the characteristics of the villainous hero on Richard III and allows him to fully expose himself. This is the understanding that the audience should have of the theme of the play.

Whenever the reporter sees a Shakespearean play‚Äîwhether on stage or on screen‚Äîhe often has a thought: he hopes to see Shakespeare's plays performed in the style of the grass-roots theaters of Shakespeare's time. For example, when a group of fake commoners in the play ask King Richard to ascend the throne, the lines of those playing the commoners should be spoken in Cockney, and King Richard's lines should include as many distorted interjections as possible to make them "jokes," etc. But this is impossible, right? Shakespearean plays performed today have become literary masterpieces and have been purified. This is beside the point, so let's stop here.

A scene from the A.D.C.'s production of Shakespeare's famous play "Richard III." Duke of Gloucester (later Henry VII) meets with Margaret, widow of Henry VI.

### Child Gambles, Loses, and Commits Suicide

‚Äî Yi

In the news column of this newspaper on the fourth of this month, there was a piece of news about "A Child Gambles, Loses, and Commits Suicide." A 17-year-old student, because his father was away doing business and there was no one to supervise him, became addicted to gambling and often took household items to pawnshops. The day before yesterday, he was reprimanded by his mother and had the thought of committing suicide. He jumped from the third-floor balcony, injured his head, and died the next day. A young man who could have been promising sacrificed himself in this way. What a pity!

In the current environment in Shanghai, ignorant young people, if they have weak wills, can easily go astray. Therefore, parents should intensify their responsibility for education and upbringing and should set a good example. Many mothers who spend all day playing mahjong do not supervise their children, allowing them to grow up in a bad environment. How can there be good results?

Because people generally neglect family education and push the responsibility of educating children onto the schools (this is certainly an unreasonable view), school authorities should also pay special attention to the private lives of students, promote proper recreation, and guide the cultivation of academic hygiene. These should all be included in the work of the schools.

Being competitive is one of the inherent instincts in human nature, but why not compete for victory and defeat in academics or technology, but insist on using money for gambling? Because ignorant young people still need the supervision of parents and teachers.

### A Brief Discussion on Coal Balls

‚Äî Jing

Coal balls are needed in every household (except for families that use gas or electricity), and monthly consumption is also a large expense in household expenses. For ordinary families, using three bundles a month costs about 150 yuan.

The creation of coal balls was in Cardiff, Wales, England. The coal produced in that area does not produce smoke when burned, so initially it was used in the navy, pressed into blocks for burning, because if the fuel used in warships had smoke, wouldn't it be seen by the enemy and become a target for attack?

Later, China had egg-shaped coal balls, which were previously made of Hongji coal. There was not much suffocating smoke when burning, so there was no need for a chimney. Therefore, every family abandoned large stoves and wooden chimneys and switched to coal ball stoves. In fact, people living in Beijing have been using coal balls for hundreds of years, but the coal produced in Beijing is very hard, so it can only be made by hand (using coal dust and water, rolling it into large sieves) to burn. Currently, the supply of Hongji coal is lacking, so Beijing coal is used as a substitute, so it is not easy to ignite. Generally, families have unconsciously created two new terms: "good coal balls" and "bad coal balls."

To make coal balls of inferior quality easier to burn, you have to smash them and burn them. When burning, they should be placed in the air, because fire needs to be hollow and people need to be solid‚Äîyou must first seek ventilation, and then there will be considerable firepower.

The firewood burned in the morning should not be discarded, but should be prepared for emergency use when the fire weakens. Housewives who understand family economics are all paying attention to the coal balls used in their homes. It is best to count the number of pieces used every day to know exactly how much is needed every day. Do not entrust all household affairs to maids and let them dispose of things casually.

### Family Maxims

When in a position of power, you must understand the pain and suffering of the poor and lowly. When young and strong, you must remember the hardships of the elderly.

People who are lovable must have some shortcomings; do not cover up their shortcomings and protect them. People who are hateful must have some strengths; do not forget their strengths.

When someone comes to you with matters of fame and fortune, do not ask about the size; respond with a calm heart. When someone comes to you with matters of right and wrong, do not ask about the length; respond with an even heart.

Do not laugh at honest and kind people for being useless; their uselessness is precisely where they are useful. Do not praise clever people for being useful; their usefulness is precisely where they are useless.

When you hear people whispering, never eavesdrop. When you see people's private rooms, avoid peeking.

Treat others with leniency, seeking innocence in those who have made mistakes. Be strict with yourself, constantly seeking mistakes in those who are innocent.

Let your capacity be as vast as the sea, able to accommodate hundreds of rivers without being full. Let your determination be like Mount Tai, unmoved by the pushing of ten thousand people.

In quiet contemplation, often reflect on your own faults, and with fewer faults, you will live better days. In idle talk, do not discuss the faults of others, for discussing the faults of others will lead to more faults.

### Educating Children Should Not Be Too Late

‚Äî Ji

Once, a mother took her one-and-a-half-year-old child to see Charles Darwin, the originator of the theory of evolution, hoping that he could guide her on how to raise her child to become an excellent child. Darwin said to her, "You are already one and a half years too late." He meant that in addition to maternal education, prenatal education is also necessary.

This is an interesting story. On the surface, it seems a bit excessive, but a mother who starts paying attention to raising her child at the age of two and a half is much better than entrusting the responsibility of taking care of the child to a nanny while she spends all day playing mahjong.

### A Diligent Astronomer

‚Äî Li

In the year 1546 AD, a child was born in Knard, Sweden. His name was Tycho Brahe, and his parents were very wealthy.

Many people have to work hard because they are very poor, but he needed to struggle even though he was rich because his parents wanted him to become a lawyer, so they sent him to schools everywhere to study. However, his interest was in studying astronomy, so he used his allowance money to buy a globe. His teacher forbade him to use the globe, so he used his only telescope to look at the stars and the moon from the window of his bedroom. He not only learned a lot of wisdom himself, but also discovered many scholars' mistakes.

After more than ten years of effort, at the age of thirty, he became a famous astronomer. The King of Denmark sympathized with him and specially built an observatory for him. Finally, he achieved his goal and became an outstanding great scholar.

Children, think about it. If he had not had ambition and saved his pocket money to buy that globe, how could he have succeeded?

### Two Roosters

‚Äî Yan Zhi

Once, two roosters met in the street. The rooster that won was jumping and crowing proudly, raising its neck high, flaunting its glory of victory.

Suddenly, an eagle swooped down and snatched it away when it was off guard.

After reading this fable, we know that a person should not be proud and complacent after achieving some victory anywhere because unknowingly, or some misfortune may come upon you. At that time, you may regret it, but it will be too late.

### Vivid and Interesting Pictures

‚Äî Wen

The method is very simple.

How can static pictures become vivid and interesting? It's very easy. Just prepare a hard cardboard, cut it to a certain size (one and a half inches long and one and a half inches wide, or larger in proportion). Then, draw two pictures on both sides of the cardboard, with equal positions and preferably related, such as a fish and a fork or a bird and a cage in the attached picture. After drawing, completely blacken the remaining parts of the cardboard. Then, drill a hole on each side of the cardboard, as shown in the center of the attached picture, and thread a thin rope through it and tie it tightly. Hold one rope in each hand and rotate the cardboard up and down, from slow to fast, and faster and faster. In this way, the two things that are clearly drawn will seem to merge; for example, a fish and a fork can change into a flying fork catching a fish, and then change into a fork entering the fish's belly. If what is drawn is a cage and a bird, then it changes into a caged bird with wings spread, and then changes into a bird flying away with the cage door unopened. Isn't this more vivid and interesting than static pictures? Children who are interested may wish to try it!

### A Week's Worth of Home-Style Recipes

‚Äî Ms. Hua Ying

The price of durum wheat is close to 70 yuan per stone. Every grain of rice is truly like a pearl. If you can't afford durum wheat, eating steamed buns is also a way to fill your stomach. Last Sunday, we provided a local method for making steamed buns. Some readers wrote to ask about another method: using yeast (Western name Yeast). If the amount is appropriate, the results will definitely be satisfactory. (Yeast can be purchased from Guangdong stores.) Here's how to make it: Use three pounds of flour, one cube of yeast, half a teaspoon of salt, a spoonful of lard, a spoonful of sugar, and warm water. Choose the filling as desired. First, dissolve the yeast in a bowl of warm water and mix it well. Prepare another bowl with half a bowl of warm water and mix in salt, lard, and sugar. Then, mix this liquid with the yeast liquid. Next, place the sifted flour in a mixing bowl and gradually pour in the liquid, mixing well. Adjust the amount of flour according to the moisture content of the dough. After half an hour, pour the wet dough onto a board, add flour, and knead until it is soft and not sticky. Then, place the kneaded dough in a bowl, cover with a clean, damp cloth, and place in a warm place for two hours. Then, you can wrap the filling and place it in a steamer to steam until cooked. It is then ready to eat.

### Still Love a Person with Epilepsy

‚Äî Zhen

Dear Editor: I am an eighteen-year-old girl who is still in elementary school. Four years ago, I started living with a twenty-year-old (we were in high school and got along for a long time, and our friendship developed into love. Although he moved elsewhere last year, we still meet on holidays. Now we have decided to grow old together. However, the problem has arisen because he suddenly contracted epilepsy at the age of five. Doctors have been consulted everywhere, but to no avail. It has been fifteen years now. It will recur after overexertion. My mother does not allow me to marry him because he has this disease, and she says that epilepsy is hereditary. This matter has made me think over and over again, and I can't find a solution. If I want to break off relations with him, I am not willing to do so. Therefore, I ask the following questions, hoping you can give me a satisfactory answer. Is there any hope of curing epilepsy? Which doctor should I consult? Can people with epilepsy not get married? I am determined to marry him, but my parents are preventing me. How should I deal with this? Is it appropriate to make an agreement with him in private? If both parents do not allow us to marry, what method should I use to deal with it?

Zhen: After four years of friendship, you will naturally develop strong feelings for each other, but marriage is a matter of lifelong happiness, and you must not let emotions cloud your judgment. Your parents' opposition is entirely for your future happiness, so this opposition is completely different from the ordinary parental opposition to their children's marriage. Here are the answers to the questions you listed:

Epilepsy is a disease of the nervous system and can actually be cured. You should find a doctor specializing in the nervous system and not give up hope. You should find a way to get treatment as soon as possible. People with epilepsy should not get married because you will not have the happiness you hope for after marriage, and the children you give birth to will definitely not be healthy (this is even more important, so do not be moved by temporary emotions before the disease is cured, creating an unhealthy family with sick children). It is not appropriate to get married until the first problem is resolved. Your parents' prevention is entirely a reasonable and well-intentioned measure. You must not, unless you only care about the feelings of the past four years and do not care about the family happiness of the next fifty years.

### Public Bond Shorts Repeatedly Exert Pressure, Longs Are Able to Cope With Ease

Regarding the bond market, the situation reversed yesterday. Due to decreased aggressive selling, the momentum of the longs increased, and the arrogance of the shorts decreased. The market sentiment was excited, and the power of the shorts was not as strong as before. Even with repeated pressure from the shorts, the power of the longs was enough to cope with ease. Many in the market have the feeling that saving money is not as good as saving public bonds. Therefore, amidst widespread buying from all parties, it continued to rise by seven points. Compared with the previous price, Class A broke through the 71 mark, reaching 72 yuan. Class B also approached 70 yuan. The excellent trend is rare in the current environment. Yi Tai and Shun Tai first bought in, followed by Run De and Guan Gong. Wu He, Yu Zhong, Da Tong, Bao Long, Hu Ji, etc. also bought in, still supplied by Tong Li, Tong Kang, Hong Da, Lian Yi, Zhong Fu, Tong Shun, etc. Market prices still trended upward, resulting in a uniform increase of 2-3 jiao to 1 yuan 1 jiao. Transactions amounted to more than 1 million yuan. The detailed list follows.

### Chinese Stocks Buying Still Very Enthusiastic

The surge in Chinese stocks remains strong. Buyers and investors are still enthusiastically absorbing them. Sino-French (new) rose from 80 yuan to 85 yuan. New Asia (new) soared from 28 yuan to 43 yuan, later quoted at 12 yuan. Cun Liao 27.5 yuan, a huge increase of 2.5 yuan. Sino-Western Dispensary 510 yuan, Wing On Company 80 yuan, Sincere 85 yuan, each up about 5 yuan. China Underwear 23 yuan, rising to around 35.1 yuan.

Shuang Ma yarn's rapid buying and selling already exceeded the Japanese yarn factory price by 100-200 yuan per unit.

### Shuang Ma Yarn Rapidly Bought and Sold, Already Higher Than Japanese Yarn Factory Price by 100-200 Yuan Per Unit

The yarn market has turned upward. This is because raw materials are difficult to loosen, so costs cannot be reduced. 42-count Blue Phoenix 9300 yuan to 9400 yuan, 42-count Moon Goddess 8600 yuan, 42-count Fairy Peach 8650 yuan, 42-count Water Moon 8800 yuan, 80-count Colored Ball 16,000 yuan, 60-count Hunter Phoenix 18,400 yuan, 20-count Water Moon 5950 yuan, 10-count Yang Crane 5150 yuan, 10-count Moon Lute 5100 yuan, 10-count Golden Pagoda 5000 yuan, 10-count Shuang Ma 5100 yuan to 5150 yuan, 10-count Shuang Hu 5150 yuan, 16-count Red Kui 4750 yuan, 14-count Weaver Girl 4810 yuan, 10-count Red Shuang Ma 4900 yuan, 10-count Red Bao Yi 4000 yuan, 10-count Green Bao Yi 3700 yuan. The initial price of 10-count Shuang Ma factory yarn was high at 5400 yuan. Those who made a profit at this time released their holdings, causing it to fall to 5300 yuan. Finally, with renewed confidence, it closed at 5400 yuan. Currently, the price of Shuang Ma factory yarn is already higher than the price of 10-count Japanese yarn factory yarn by 100-200 yuan per unit. However, speculators use margin relationships, so when they release, prices fall, and when they buy, prices rise.

### Cash Soars

The black market for cash has turned strong again. This is because Tianjin Gang Bao Yi reported favorable news, and the financial community and asset holders are absorbing it. Furthermore, the sharp rise in cotton yarn has suddenly boosted confidence in all sectors. The initial transaction price in the morning was 20,200 yuan, up 200 yuan. Cash firms and securities firms acted as agents for the Tianjin gang to sell aggressively, cutting 150 yuan to 19,950 yuan. Around 10 o'clock, the Tianjin gang stopped selling, and the market suddenly strengthened. Banks and some securities firms increased their bids, up 200 yuan from the previous day. After the close, the asking price immediately increased. A certain gold firm and securities firm and a certain gang discussed raising the price in the hall, rising to 20,500 yuan at noon. The exchange rate for gold ornaments was still quoted at 2,200 yuan per tael by Da Xin and its peers (buying price reduced by 200 yuan). Silver bullion was quoted at 16 yuan, the black market has risen to 19.5 yuan, and silver coins were also slightly higher at 8.5 yuan each.

### Gold Pound Continues to Rise

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw the British and American gold pounds continue to rise by 10 yuan, the former to 520 yuan, the latter to 510 yuan. US dollar notes were 28 yuan, Hong Kong notes were high at around 3 yuan, and military notes were 5.45 yuan.

The Money Trade Association discounted interest by 1.5 jiao. The discount rate for new exchange bills remained unchanged at 1/10th of a chi. External firms had to pay a handling fee of 20 yuan. The price difference between savings certificates and legal tender was 2 yuan and 2.02 yuan, which was also flat.

### Sweet Potato Noodles Increasingly Adopted

Soybean trading saw a decline yesterday. This is because the miscellaneous grain group had already dispatched a small number of soybeans, leading to a wait-and-see attitude. Buyers were very rare. Only 50 packages of Chongming beach red beans were opened in the unified market, selling themselves at 203 yuan in old currency, and one package of Shaba sold itself at 83 yuan in new currency.

The arrival of corn was not active, and scattered households were quite willing to let go, and the market was flat and tired. Yesterday, more than 200 packages of Wuhu corn were sold, priced at 98 yuan in new currency for delivery, selling themselves at 96 yuan. One truckload of Chuzhou corn was priced at 98 yuan in new currency for delivery.

Soybean cake sales were still not smooth, and transactions remained sporadic. The market trend continued to lack change. A total of 300 warehouse orders for Li Zi soybean cake in May were priced at 43 yuan in new currency. Hankou overnight cake 1000 yuan, 31 yuan to 30 yuan. Xing Ji soybean cake 500 old warehouse orders in April, 35 yuan, and 500 new warehouse orders in May, 45.5 yuan.

Sweet potato noodles: Because more and more poor people are eating them, sales are quite good, and the market trend is gradually strengthening. Yesterday, 50 packages were opened at a price of 116 yuan in new currency.

Wheat bran: Sellers were scarce, and sentiment was upward. Yesterday, 300 small packages of wheat bran were opened at the end of May, and 500 packages of warehouse orders were priced at 75 yuan in new jurisdiction.

### Sea Cucumber Colors Incomplete

Sea cucumber: Because the market has incomplete files, especially the foreign goods are rare, and the eastern goods, such as patterned sea cucumber and ten-strand sea cucumber, are lacking. Only bottle sea cucumber has some inventory, but the number is also limited, so the market price has risen again. The current market price is 800 yuan in new currency, which is about 100 yuan more than the previous price in old currency.

### Red Dates New Market Opens

Red dates: Because there are not many Shen deposits, and although the Tianjin numbers have been planned for some time, the asking price has frequently increased, and the future has a tightening trend. Yesterday, several dozen packages of Cangzhou red dates were opened, priced at 135 yuan in new currency.

### Bamboo Steel Bars Quiet

Due to the sharp decline in the local construction industry recently, coupled with the suspension of sales to northern customers, the market for 10-foot bamboo steel bars has been quiet. However, the shouted price of Tongcai is still high, and Bao Xiao Yi is more and more. Yesterday, for example, 3-4 point patterned steel bars sold for 7670 yuan per ton in Central Reserve certificates. 5-point to 1-inch upper body sold for 7500 yuan per ton.
