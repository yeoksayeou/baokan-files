### Holding Sino-Japanese Cultural Awards

Recently, there have been loud calls for the interconnection of Sino-Japanese culture, which is indeed something worthy of our utmost attention and excitement. Originally, culture is the offspring of the times, and culture itself can only develop upwards and forwards. However, in the process of cultural development, it often adapts to each era and expresses the characteristics of that era. Now is the era of close Sino-Japanese cooperation, jointly striving for the victory of the Greater East Asia War, so the communication of Sino-Japanese culture is the most important issue at present.

When we talk about the communication of Sino-Japanese culture, although the main thing is to actively lay the foundation and open up a broad avenue for the cultural construction of a new China after the war, the world-historical significance of this preparatory work for Sino-Japanese cultural communication cannot be ignored. Therefore, how to promote the exchange and development of Sino-Japanese culture is one of the most fundamental tasks in the current cultural movement. Unfortunately, in recent years, the two countries of China and Japan have been at war, and the people of the two countries have had deep divisions. The cultural mission in this great era has been put aside, which is not only a misfortune for China and Japan, but also a misfortune for human culture. What makes us particularly regretful is that today, those who are enthusiastic and have the opportunity to promote cooperative collaboration between China and Japan may have done their best in military, political, and economic aspects, but as for how to promote Sino-Japanese cultural exchange and development, although it cannot be said that they have not paid attention to it at all, the implementation is far from enough, and it is too far from what the times demand. At this time when China and Japan are striving for further cooperative collaboration, we cannot but loudly demand that both parties, government and public alike, pay attention to the cultural aspects.

In order to promote the exchange and development of Sino-Japanese culture, we feel it is necessary to hold Sino-Japanese cultural awards to be awarded to those who have made genuine contributions to Sino-Japanese cultural exchange and development. We do not believe that promoting the exchange and development of Sino-Japanese culture necessarily requires monetary rewards. However, we cannot ignore the current situation in China, especially the current situation in Chinese cultural circles. The vast majority of people in cultural circles, like ordinary poor people—or even more cruelly—are trapped in a state of hunger and cold. Most Chinese cultural people, inheriting the traditional spirit of Chinese Confucianism, have the spirit of being poor but upright, of being "unmoved by wealth and honor, and unyielding to force." However, due to the influence of the material environment and other reasons, although they have the determination and strength to strive for cultural construction, they are ultimately unable to start or develop their work. I don't know how many geniuses, how many outstanding talents, are suppressed in displacement, destitution, hunger, and cold. Therefore, we sincerely hope that the governments and the public of both China and Japan, especially the leaders of various sectors of society, will pay attention to this situation, gather the strength of the masses, and create a new environment and a new atmosphere so that cultural people with aspirations can work hard for cultural construction and for promoting Sino-Japanese cultural exchange and development from a purely cultural and purely academic standpoint. And holding Sino-Japanese cultural awards to reward writers who have made achievements in Sino-Japanese cultural exchange and development is one of the concrete ways to do this work. We can move from the smooth implementation of the Sino-Japanese cultural awards to seek a high degree of development of Sino-Japanese culture.

Since the target of the Sino-Japanese cultural awards is people who have made achievements in the exchange and development of Sino-Japanese culture, then, first of all, there should be no restrictions on nationality, qualifications, resume, gender, or even ideology or belief. As long as they have indeed made achievements in Sino-Japanese cultural exchange and development and are recognized by the public, they are qualified to receive the award. Only in this way can we gather the truly talented people who are being suppressed in all aspects, only in this way can we truly promote the exchange of Sino-Japanese culture, and then build a cultural construction undertaking in this new era and write a glorious page for the future world history.

### Wang, concurrently Premier of the Executive Yuan, visits Prime Minister Tojo in Japan and holds important talks for a long time, expressing congratulations on the war results of the Japanese army.

Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) - Wang, concurrently Premier of the Executive Yuan of the National Government, visited Prime Minister Tojo at the Prime Minister's official residence at 3:00 PM today, accompanied by Foreign Minister Chu Minyi, Finance Minister Zhou Fohai, and Deputy Foreign Minister Zhou Jiangxiang. Prime Minister Tojo, along with Foreign Minister Tani, Minister for Greater East Asia Aoki, and Chief Secretary Hoshino, cordially received them. Premier Wang first expressed his congratulations on the brilliant war results achieved by Japan since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. He then held important talks with Prime Minister Tojo, which lasted for two and a half hours before returning. Prime Minister Tojo visited the guest house at 5:50 PM that afternoon to return Premier Wang's visit.

Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) - Wang, Chairman of the National Government and concurrently Premier of the Executive Yuan, received more than 20 Chinese students at the Japanese Army Officer Academy at the Greater East Asia Guest House at 10:00 AM on the 21st, and gave them encouraging instructions. At 1:00 PM, Premier Wang and his entourage went to the official residence of the Minister for Greater East Asia to attend an informal banquet held by Minister Aoki. Ambassador Xu, Economic Advisor to the National Government Ishiwatari, Military Advisors Matsui and Teraoka, as well as Vice Minister Yamamoto of the Ministry for Greater East Asia and various directors-general, were also invited to attend. The atmosphere was convivial, and the discussions were pleasant. The gathering ended at around 2:00 PM. At 3:00 PM, accompanied by Foreign Minister Chu and Finance Minister Zhou, he revisited the Prime Minister's official residence to exchange views with the Prime Minister.

Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) - Regarding the visit to Japan by Wang, Chairman of the National Government and concurrently Premier of the Executive Yuan, today's Tokyo newspapers, in addition to publishing the news with large headlines in important positions on the first page and attaching a photo of Chairman Wang shaking hands with Prime Minister Tojo after landing, unanimously published articles expressing welcome and clarifying the great significance of Chairman Wang's visit. For example, the Asahi Shimbun stated, "The visit of His Excellency Wang, Chairman of the National Government and concurrently Premier of the Executive Yuan, to our country again on the occasion of the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia War is of profound significance. Chairman Wang's first visit to our country after advocating peace was in May of Showa 14 (1939), which was the 28th year of the Republic of China. At that time, because the peace movement was still in its infancy, it was a secret and unofficial visit. His second visit was in June of last year as Chairman of the National Government of the Republic of China and concurrently Premier of the Executive Yuan, and our government and public warmly welcomed him. The grandeur of the welcoming ceremony and the enthusiasm of the emotions were unprecedented. Chairman Wang paid respects to His Majesty the Emperor, expressed his gratitude to our government and public for assisting the development of the National Government, and held cordial talks with our government authorities on how to further promote and strengthen cooperation between the two countries. As for the purpose of this visit, one is to express congratulations on the brilliant war results achieved by our country, and at the same time, in order to cope with the current new situation, to directly exchange views with our government authorities on how China and Japan can further closely cooperate. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Republic of China has been assisting our country under the leadership of Chairman Wang, adhering to the spirit of sharing weal and woe, to complete the war. Today, we deeply feel the need to re-examine the practical methods of cooperation between the two countries. As far as Japan is concerned, the starting point should be to strengthen assistance to the development of the National Government; as far as China is concerned, it is to strengthen the cooperative attitude. Chairman Wang's visit to Japan at this important time is believed to be able to hold sincere talks with our government authorities and achieve the goals of both countries." The Yomiuri Hochi Shimbun claimed that when the Ministry for Greater East Asia was established on November 1, Prime Minister Tojo explained that the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere thereafter should be a stage to complete the Greater East Asia War, and also said that construction is always construction, but now he deeply feels that it is necessary to make it contribute directly or indirectly to the war. Furthermore, at the East Asia Economic Roundtable Conference on November 26, Minister for Greater East Asia Aoki explained that the construction of Greater East Asia is to comprehensively enrich the strength of the entire Greater East Asia to establish autonomous national defense economies for each country, but the urgent task at present is how to rapidly strengthen war power. The roundtable conference also issued a statement of the same purpose on the closing day. In addition, when Chairman Wang of the National Government met with Chinese and Japanese reporters on the 5th of this month, he said that since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the reason why I have encouraged the people to share weal and woe is that China is a part of East Asia, and China will become an important part of East Asia. The fundamental concept of the peace movement is also this. On the anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, Chairman Wang also published a message to the people, in which he said, "Peace is the only way to save the country. Now, we must work together with our Japanese friends to share the great responsibility of defending East Asia. Japan has stood at the front, and the responsibility for the rear belongs to China." China's determination to cooperate with our country to complete the Greater East Asia War can be seen from this. Looking back, since the joint announcement of the Sino-Japanese-Manchu declaration, the relations between the Republic of China and Manchukuo have become closer, and the unity of East Asia has become more solid due to the formation of the Sino-Japanese-Manchu axis. We are certain that Chairman Wang's visit to our country will not encroach on the further cooperation between China and Japan, and will make it a reality. The Greater East Asia War will also be completed because of this, which is what the bitter people cannot bear to expect and foreshadows comfort.

### War Results of the Japanese Army in North China in One Year

Beijing, 21st (Central News Agency) - Thanks to the continuous efforts of the Japanese army in North China, public security has become increasingly consolidated, and the remaining Chongqing troops have no strength to recover. The war situation of the Japanese army in the past year is recorded as follows: After the Chongqing troops were driven out of Hebei Province, they penetrated into the Lu-Jin-Yu border area, plotting an opportunity to move again. In the Yu Province, they can only linger in the Jin-Yu border area and the south bank of the Yellow River. In the central area of Lu Province, Yu Xuezhong's Lu-Su war zone was annihilated at the beginning of the year. By May, the Chongqing 39th Army Group was also severely damaged. Subsequently, the Chongqing miscellaneous army was also defeated by the Japanese army near Zhangqiu. From August to the present, the Japanese army launched the second central Shandong operation. In the An-Lin-Yi-Dong area and the battlefield on the banks of the old Yellow River, after General Mo Liangcheng issued a peace telegram on April 22, the morale and spirit of the people in Chongqing became more and more dispersed and depressed. In Jin Province, the troops under Gao Guizi were completely annihilated in the Zhongtiao Mountains. The troops under Liu Jin (27th Army) in the Lingchuan area also suffered a setback. In Yu Province, the Jin-Ji-Yu provincial border operation was launched in early June, sweeping away the Communist army (18th Army Group) in one fell swoop. Then, the spearhead was turned to the Ji-Cha border area, and the base of Gu Ling (24th Army Group) was destroyed. The miscellaneous army collapsed without a trace, leaving more than 10,000 corpses and capturing 50. In addition, the Chongqing troops in the Wo River basin in southern Yu Province have no room to move. Corresponding to the operations in Ji Province, there were several raids on Ordos in the Mengjiang area. The Fu Zuoyi army under Zhu Shaoliang of the Chongqing 8th War Zone was defeated several times in these operations, and Chiang Ting-wen's First War Zone was completely annihilated. It is said that the Chongqing army in North China has 700,000 troops, and one-third of them have been completely wiped out.

Jinan, 21st (Central News Agency) - Since the Japanese army units have been operating in the Shandong Peninsula braving the northerly wind, they completed a large encirclement net of 48 kilometers in the Ai-Shan-Penglai-Yifu area on the 17th of this month, launching an annihilation operation against the main force of the 5th and 2nd regiments of the Chongqing Army Shandong Column, about 3,000 people. That night, they occupied its stronghold, Dongzhuang (67 kilometers southwest of Ai Mountain), and immediately cleared the remaining troops in the vicinity. On the same day, the Japanese army and the security army jointly attacked the Chongqing army Fangcheng Liujiazhuang (32 kilometers northwest of Jimo), and occupied it that night. In these two battles, the Chongqing army left a total of 563 corpses, and 2303 people were captured. The Japanese army captured a mountain gun, a light and heavy pursuit gun each, and a large number of other weapons and ammunition.

Qingdao, 21st (Central News Agency) - Since the Japanese army started the anti-communist operation in the Shandong Peninsula on November 22, the comprehensive war results harvested to date are as follows: The communist army left 1746 corpses and 9987 were captured. The Japanese army captured 161 mortars, 8 light machine guns, 1 mountain gun, 1027 rifles, and many other military weapons and ammunition.

The allocated amount for each special zone has been decided, including 12,700 yuan for the Liang-Jia Relief Home, 22,000 yuan for temporary rice porridge and relief for the elderly and weak, 10,000 yuan allocated to Hai-Ning, 3,000 yuan to Pinghu, 27,000 yuan to Haiyan, 12,000 yuan to Songnan, and 20,000 yuan to Jinshan.

### Ambassador Shigemitsu Makes a Statement to Reporters, Returning Home to Report on the Results of the Ambassadors and Consuls Meeting and Consult with Relevant Authorities on Everything

Tokyo, 21st (News Agency) - Japanese Ambassador to China Shigemitsu arrived here yesterday and went to the guest house that evening to pay his respects to Chairman Wang. He then visited Minister for Greater East Asia Aoki to report on the meeting of Japanese envoys and consuls general stationed in China and requested instructions on everything. Today, he called on Prime Minister and Army Minister Tojo, Navy Minister Shimada, and Minister for Greater East Asia Aoki. In the afternoon, he met with a group of reporters at the Imperial Hotel and made a statement, saying that when the Ministry for Greater East Asia was established, he returned home to request instructions. After returning to his post, he promoted the affairs of the Ministry for Greater East Asia in accordance with the government's policy, and convened a meeting of envoys and consuls general stationed in China on the 17th and 18th of this month to convey the government's policy. This time, he returned home to consult with various relevant authorities and report on the meeting. Since the return of the National Government to the capital, it has been more than two years, and since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, it has been more than a year. Chairman Wang deeply feels that there are many matters that need to be directly exchanged with the Japanese government authorities, so he came this time. At the meeting of envoys and consuls general stationed in China, in addition to elaborating on the government's policy, I also hoped that everyone would work hard in their official duties. In short, the central purpose of our country's policy towards China is to make Sino-Japanese cooperation. The Chinese government and public are concerned about the changes in the world situation and deeply understand the common destiny of China and Japan. Japan sincerely hopes that China will develop as a part of Greater East Asia, and the Chinese people also fully recognize this point. However, there are still many things that China and Japan need to work together on. I painfully feel that handling Sino-Japanese issues is extremely important in completing the Greater East Asia War.

### The Su-He Engineering Bureau Plans Spring Repair Projects

Yangzhou, 21st (Central News Agency) - The Northern Jiangsu Canal Engineering Bureau believes that the canal embankments are related to the lives and property of the people and must be repaired in order to defend against floods. This year, it applied for funds to carry out spring repair projects, but the funds were too small to cover the expenses, and some important projects could not be carried out. Now that the winter water has receded, the bureau is planning for next year's spring repair projects for the sake of being prepared for the future. It specially dispatched personnel to the east and west canal embankments of Jiang-Gao-Bao counties last month to conduct on-site surveys of the projects that need to be repaired (there are more than 60 places), which took more than ten days to complete. Now, the Yun-Gong Bureau is rushing to install charts, and as soon as they are complete, it will apply to the Northern Jiangsu Xingying for verification and transfer to the Water Conservancy Association to allocate funds for the next year's business expenses.

### Tunisian Front Line: Only Air Force Activity; German Forces in Libya Establish New Defense Line

Berlin, 21st (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - According to news here last night, the British Eighth Army in the Sirt area has been unable to maintain contact with the Axis forces and has lost its offensive power on the flanks due to heavy losses in the past week. According to German military sources here, General Montgomery's activities along the coastal highway, following the rearguard of the German-Italian forces, have been extremely cautious. The British forces fear that Marshal Rommel will take surprising action. At the same time, Axis engineers have laid minefields, tank traps, and other obstacles to hinder the British advance. Therefore, Marshal Rommel has been able to occupy defensive positions according to the original plan. The British forces, advancing hundreds of kilometers, lack cold water for their mechanized unit engines. The further the British advance, the more difficult it becomes to supply them. The British Royal Air Force's activities are also very cautious, so only a few aircraft have been used to bomb Axis forces along the coast. The German-Italian air force is extremely active. German aircraft have sunk two enemy ships north of Cape Eploia and outside the port of Benghazi. Only air force activity is occurring on the Tunisian front line. On Saturday, German aircraft braved bad weather to attack enemy troops and positions at low altitude. Enemy fuel depots near Pia and enemy artillery positions in central Tunisia were also heavily bombed.

Lisbon, 21st (Havas dispatch) - According to news received here, German forces in Libya have established a solid new defense line. There were no major battles on the Tunisian front yesterday. According to Allied sources, British and American forces are unusually active in southern Tunisia. Reports that the commander of the German forces in North Africa, General Rommel, has arrived in Tunisia to reorganize the Axis forces there are probably untrue. General Rommel and his troops are still in Tripolitania.

### Spanish General Luo Yi Arrives in Beijing

### Japanese Spokesman Praises Japanese-Thai Relations; Tojo Visits Thai Ambassador to Offer Congratulations

Tokyo, 21st (Domei News Agency dispatch) - Information Bureau spokesman Mr. Hori, on the first anniversary of the signing of the Japan-Thailand alliance, praised the Thai people for taking decisive action to wage war, proving their understanding of the significance of the current war. Mr. Hori said, "The Thai people are well aware of the true meaning of the Greater East Asia War, and the entire Japanese people deeply believe that we will defeat our common enemy and achieve final victory, realizing a new order in this part of the world and contributing to world peace. In the past year, the British, American, and Dutch forces in the Greater East Asia region have been completely eliminated. The Thai government and people, under the capable leadership of Prime Minister Phibun, have wholeheartedly cooperated with Japan, sharing weal and woe, to wage war. At the same time, Thailand has strived to restore its innate Asian character in internal affairs, sparing no effort to eliminate the remaining British and American forces in the country. The military, political, economic, and cultural relations between Japan and Thailand have become even closer, as evidenced by the repeated exchange of missions between the two countries. The future relationship between Japan and Thailand will be even more harmonious. The Japanese army has achieved glorious victories in cooperation with the people of Greater East Asia, defeating the British, American, and Dutch forces. The countries in the Greater East Asia region have been able to restore their original appearance, and their people now have the opportunity to develop their inherent characteristics without interference from Britain and the United States. The relationship between Japan and Thailand has been friendly for centuries, and the relationship in the past year is particularly memorable. At the beginning of the current war, Thailand took decisive steps to conclude an alliance with Japan based on mutual respect for independence and sovereignty, and became an important member of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and then declared war on the United States and the British Empire, fully demonstrating the spirit of the alliance.

Tokyo, 21st (Domei News Agency dispatch) - Information Bureau spokesman Mr. Hori stated this morning while receiving foreign journalists that Prime Minister Tojo visited Thai Ambassador to Japan Jaya Nama at the Thai Embassy at 9:15 this morning to offer congratulations on the first anniversary of the signing of the Japan-Thailand alliance.

Tokyo, 21st (Domei News Agency dispatch) - Prime Minister Tojo sent a telegram of congratulations to Thai Prime Minister Phibun today on the anniversary of the Japan-Thailand military alliance, expressing gratitude for Thailand's cooperation in enabling Japan to achieve brilliant victories, and stating that the strengthening of cooperation between Thailand and Japan would further consolidate the foundation for final victory, and that he firmly believed that the common goal of Japan and Thailand to defeat Britain and the United States would soon be realized.

Tokyo, 21st (Domei News Agency dispatch) - Prime Minister Tojo said at a rally celebrating the first anniversary of the Japan-Thailand alliance this afternoon, roughly that we should redouble our efforts and never give up until final victory is achieved, and that he firmly believed that Thailand would trust Japan and continue to cooperate. Foreign Minister Tani hosted a banquet for the Thai Ambassador this afternoon and said, roughly, that Japan and Thailand must continue to work together to establish a new order in East Asia. Thailand's declaration of war on Britain and the United States, the Thai army's assistance in the war, and the exchange of ambassadors are all clear proofs of the consolidation of friendly relations between the two countries.

Japan and Thailand Ratify Cultural Agreement

### Tour of the Forefront in North China (Dialogue)

— Member of the House of Representatives Kunitoshi Tsugumo, Secretary-General of the House of Representatives Osamu Oki

Translated from "Modern" December 1942

Reporter: The two of you recently toured the forefront of North China, observed in detail the valiant fighting of the Japanese army, and comforted the Japanese army under the rain of bullets. I would like to hear from you today a truthful report from the field.

North China as a Rear Supply Base

Reporter: First of all, what is the situation in North China as a rear supply base for the Greater East Asia War? I would like you to start by talking about a general overview of the reality of North China.

Tsugumo: Mr. Oki attended the 10th anniversary ceremony of Manchukuo and then went to Central China via North China, right?

Oki: Yes. I feel that the conclusion of the Greater East Asia War lies in China. Therefore, I wanted to inspect Mengjiang, North China, and Central China no matter what. So I went with Speaker of the House of Representatives Okada.

Tsugumo: I think North China, as part of the comprehensive planned economy of Japan, Manchuria, and China, is the most important place in China. Therefore, I would like to ask Mr. Oki, who has made a comprehensive inspection, to give a general overview first.

Oki: North China, as a rear supply base for the Greater East Asia War, is of great importance to Japan's assistance. North China also includes Mengjiang behind it. Both coal and iron have very rich reserves, and these resources are now being developed and supplied to Japan to assist in the war effort. Japan's industrial salt mostly relies on North China. Therefore, North China has a very strong power to assist in terms of resources.

Tsugumo: As Mr. Oki said, North China's four major resources, namely salt, iron, coal, and cotton, are important materials that allow the Greater East Asia War's supply line to be held firm. For example, the industrial salt I mentioned was mostly imported from the Mediterranean, the Red Sea, and Somaliland before the war. Since the outbreak of the China Incident, imports have gradually decreased, and later the source was completely cut off. North China salt took the place of this distant sea salt. Of course, it cannot supply all the needs, but at least it has been able to solve most of the needs. This type of salt mainly consists of three types: Changlu salt produced along the Bohai Sea coast, Shandong salt taken from the north and south coasts of Shandong Province, and Hedong salt from southern Shanxi Province. In addition, there are well salt and rock salt, etc., produced everywhere in North China and Mengjiang. Before the war, this was extracted using extremely primitive and immature methods. Since the Japanese army stationed in North China, it has introduced excellent technology and materials to engage in large-scale salt production. Although the production increase plan is still in progress, the amount of salt production has already reached a very high number. Now that the import of sea salt has been completely cut off, if there were no North China salt, then the dye industry, the soda industry, and the important industries that manufacture special weapons and materials would almost all come to a standstill, which would have a significant impact on our country's war effort. With North China's salt, we were able to avoid hardship. Next is iron. I have not visited the iron mine. Have you been there, Mr. Oki?

Oki: There is a place called Xuanhua south of Zhangjiakou. There is the Longyan Iron Mine nearby. I inspected it.

Tsugumo: There are rich iron mines everywhere in Shanxi Province, and Hebei Province is also full of them.

Oki: The reserves of the Longyan Iron Mine are said to be hundreds of millions of tons, divided into five mining areas. Among them, the one that is being developed on a large scale is the Jiabao Iron Mine. The reserves here are extremely rich, and they are now preparing to be shipped to Japan and have become an important ironmaking resource.

Tsugumo: Next is cotton in North China. In today's world, where imports from India and American cotton have been cut off, I don't need to say how important a resource it is for Japan's war effort and the lives of its people. Furthermore, it has great potential for future production increases. There is also coal in North China, which has the world's largest reserves.

Oki: Speaking of coal, first of all, there is Kaijie coal. Kaijie coal has extremely strong adhesion and is most suitable for ironmaking. Datong coal in Mengjiang is only suitable for fuel and not for ironmaking.

Tsugumo: Among the North China as a rear supply base, the most noteworthy is Shanxi Province. We all know that its coal reserves are said to be the world's largest. In addition, underground resources such as iron, manganese, sand, fluorite, limestone, gypsum, and gold and silver are available, so to speak. Furthermore, as a result of combining these resources, various manufacturing industries can be produced. For example, combining gypsum and coal results in the ammonium sulfate industry. Combining limestone, clay, and coal results in the sanhe earth industry. Combining iron, manganese, sand, fluorite, limestone, etc., and coal results in the ironmaking industry or the steelmaking industry. Before the war, some of these industries were used in extremely immature ways. Recently, Japan has introduced technology and materials and is planning a mass production plan. There is already considerable progress, so in the future, the industry in Shanxi Province has great hopes. In general, the above-mentioned resources and materials greatly increase the value of North China as a rear supply base.

Important Resources of Mengjiang

Tsugumo: Mr. Oki and I happened to meet at Xuanhua Station, right?

Oki: Yes, Xuanhua was a very famous city before. The famous Li Hongzhang and the first Prime Minister of Manchukuo, Zheng Xiaoxu, used to sit here. Behind this city are the Jiabao and Yantongshan mines just mentioned.

Tsugumo: Which mine can be clearly seen from the window of the train on the Jingbao Line (i.e., the railway between Beijing and Baotou)?

Oki: That is the Yantongshan Mine. Jiabao is in the mountains, so you can't see it. The Yantongshan mine vein is exposed and very easy to excavate.

Tsugumo: From the window of the train, you can clearly see the bronze-colored mine vein exposed in the middle of the mountain from afar.

Reporter: This is really amazing.

Oki: It is indeed amazing. Strictly speaking, the Longyan Iron Mine belongs to the Mengjiang area, but it can be considered a resource near North China.

Tsugumo: Among the resources of Mengjiang, the first thing to mention is the Longyan Iron Mine and the Datong Coal Mine. Mr. Oki, have you visited the Datong Coal Mine? I just passed near it on the way to incense at the Shifosi Temple and looked at it from afar, so I would like to hear about it.

Oki: The reserves of the Datong Coal Mine are said to reach hundreds of millions of tons. It is a very wide-ranging coal mine. The characteristic of the Datong Coal Mine is that you can smoke inside the pit. In other words, there is no danger of methane gas here. The coal miners also work while smoking without a care in the world. This is truly a rare coal mine scene.

Tsugumo: Because methane gas does not occur, it is not necessary to use safety lamps, just torches. Work is very convenient.

### Record of the Solomon Sea and Air Battle

(From the North Plain Naval News Team at 〇〇 Base, 12th)

Translated from the December 13th "Osaka Mainichi Newspaper"

Our invincible naval air force has created an imperishable pyramid in the history of world naval warfare. Since the South Pacific naval battle on October 26th, across the entire Pacific sea area centered on the Solomon Islands, it has continuously pursued the enemy's remaining fleet and its air power. On November 11th, our large formation of combined fighter and bomber squadrons broke through the turbulent clouds unique to the South Sea, stormed the fierce anti-aircraft fire of 〇 Island in the Solomon Islands, and daringly carried out unparalleled bombing in the world, burning and destroying more than twenty enemy large and small aircraft and hitting one transport ship. On the other hand, the fighter squadrons covered the attack teams and completed a great battle result of shooting down twenty-seven enemy fighters. Then, on the 12th, our fighter squadrons, covering the torpedo bomber squadrons, engaged in a majestic daytime aerial battle with more than twenty enemy Grumman fighters, P39s, and P40s. As a result, nineteen of them were shot down. On the other hand, the torpedo bomber aircraft rushed to the enemy fleet's airspace and sank one armored cruiser and one light cruiser in succession, and burned three transport ships. Due to the night raid by our fleet unit on the same night and the subsequent multiple naval battles, our navy established unprecedented miraculous achievements. The reporter met the 〇〇 commander of this fighter unit and the following 〇〇 brave warriors at the 〇〇 base and talked a lot. Therefore, I wrote "Record of the Battle" to share with the readers.

Look! The Enemy Fleet

It was before dawn on November 12th. At the 〇〇 air base far south of the equator, all the crew members were energetically doing naval exercises. The maintenance personnel were adding fuel, and in the operations command post, the commanders were studying the battle plans. At this moment, we received a report saying that an enemy mobile unit had appeared south of Santa Cruz Island and was approaching the Solomon Islands. The enemy has fallen into the trap, "Just like moths to a flame, coming to their own deaths," everyone shouted "Hurray!" The order to "Prepare to depart" was shouted from all directions. Thus, at 〇:00 AM, with the departure of the torpedo bomber aircraft, the fighter squadrons also grandly took off, giving a silent response to the waving hats of the commander and the ground crew. The large formation emitted a roaring explosion in the morning sky of the South Sea and flew all the way south.

Magnificent Daytime Aerial Battle

The Solomon Islands area was shrouded in thick turbulent clouds. Passing through the clouds, about 〇 hours later, our formation appeared above the island. It was noon at 12:00 PM. Ahead, we had just discovered a part of the enemy fleet. From far below, "pa pa pa", white smoke rose up. That was the enemy's anti-aircraft fire. Sooner said than done, enemy Grumman fighters and other aircraft immediately appeared below the wingmen. The commander's aircraft made a "left turn" in front. Aircraft 〇 had already joined the air battle. The Grumman was the first to be hit. The remaining enemy aircraft numbers two and three were also successively swept by bullets. Soon, aircraft number two's tail was hit. With a "whoosh", it burst into flames. With another strike, it "disintegrated in the air" and plunged headfirst. Our aircraft 〇 was just about to make a "sharp turn" on the left, and two enemy aircraft again spewed fire and fell down. Enemy soldiers opened their parachutes and frantically tried to escape. The windscreen was completely shattered. The sight of the aircraft falling was very pathetic. Unlike the P39 and P40 types, the Grumman fighter was a very excellent thing, but unfortunately, when it encountered our fighter formation, it could not exert its power at all. Therefore, they were extremely afraid of close combat and always carried out "high-altitude tactics" and "surprise attack tactics" hiding in the clouds. The wingmen were familiar with the enemy's tactics, unexpectedly gave a blow, and immediately went to cover the torpedo bomber aircraft. The daytime aerial battle continued like this for twenty-five minutes, and finally completed the great battle result of shooting down nineteen enemy aircraft, including Grumman, P39, and P40 types. During this period, our torpedo bomber squadron, under the cover of the fighter squadron, also broke into the fierce anti-aircraft fire and daringly carried out accurate launches. At this time, the enemy's anti-aircraft fire became more and more intense, simply like a thick and solid wall shooting up. The enemy fleet's main guns and secondary guns all opened fire, but our eagle-like formation did not pay any attention to these and still rushed forward. What a great naval spirit of killing the enemy!

The Aircraft Turned into a Ball of Fire

The entire torpedo bomber squadron rushed forward in orderly steps. When approaching the enemy fleet, they suddenly descended from a high altitude to a low altitude of 〇〇 meters. All of a sudden, a water column two or three times higher than the mast burst out from the hull of the enemy armored cruiser. Then, thick smoke billowed straight up. "Hit, hit!" We watched it sink. At this time, our aircraft 〇 spread its wings. Everyone thought it was going to fly away, but unexpectedly, it turned around and rushed towards the enemy light cruiser, completing a courageous self-explosion. At the same time, the torpedoes released by the wingmen also hit the hull of the enemy light cruiser, and a water column two or three hundred meters high burst out. In the meantime, the enemy transport fleet was also enveloped in flames one by one. Our fighter squadron, waiting impatiently next to the torpedo bomber aircraft cover, dived down and began machine gun strafing. Black smoke shrouded the enemy ships making extremely tilted movements. There were also enemy transport ships that were lost in the north and south and did not know which way to escape. This torpedo bombing battle can be said to be the most ingenious move in this war. This is simply a deadly battle that aerial combat and bombing combat cannot match, and cannot be described in words. The appearance of the wingmen turning into a ball of fire and self-exploding was so beautiful. As for the aerial engagement with the enemy fighters, that was even more guaranteed to win. Enemy P39 and P40 type aircraft hid in the clouds and simply dared not come out. Sometimes, taking advantage of their unpreparedness, they gave a blow, and they fell down in flames. If not, they turned into a wisp of smoke and fled back into the clouds. It is certainly not okay to be too careless, but comparatively speaking, we are still a cut above. In this way, our eagle squadron overcame the bad weather on the way back and safely returned to the base. Commander 〇〇 and Squadron Commander 〇〇, who came to greet us, listened quietly to the crew members' unpretentious reports. Unit Commander 〇〇 simply said, "Mission accomplished, everyone worked hard." Everyone lined up and held a silent prayer to the south. However, the irresistible feeling of gratitude, like a spring, kept flowing in the hearts of the crew members. In this way, on the 13th and 14th, our formation spread its wings again and flew towards the southern sky. (Translated by Mu)

### Edible Oil Retailers Merge, Sales Begin Today, Ten Days' Worth of Oil Rationed, Sold Out in Three Days, Limit of One Catty for Group A, Half a Catty for Group B

—Oil Rationing by Headcount to Be Implemented Starting Next Year—

The Shanghai Edible Oil Trade Wholesale Office originally planned to supply edible oil to this port and sell it on the 20th of this month with house donation tickets and household registration certificates. However, due to the forgery of house donation tickets, the authorities considered it inappropriate and needed to reconsider it. Therefore, it was decided that sales will continue as usual from today to meet the needs of the public. Today, the city's 1,830 retailers have merged and divided into two groups, A and B, and have paid and received the ten-day ration. Group A will start selling today, and Group B will start selling on the 26th, and each will sell out within three days. Shanghai She reporter learned definite news from the wholesale office yesterday that the method of purchasing oil with house donation tickets and household registration certificates, as well as the new system of oil rationing by headcount, are being closely discussed by the wholesale office and the authorities. Once a decision is made, it will be implemented starting in January next year. However, the military allocation authorities intend to follow the method of grain rationing by headcount for the method of selling oil, considering it the only proper method, as it can prevent illegal activities such as reselling for profit and oil squeezing gangs. Details are recorded below.

Designated Oil Shops Act as Rationing Agents

Retailers in both groups A and B have completed payment procedures for the amount of edible oil that the wholesale office can allocate and receive oil from the ten designated distribution points: (1) Xinda Oil Shop, Henan Road and Ningbo Road, (2) Yuanda Oil Shop, Xinzha Road, (3) Dafengchang Oil Shop, An'an Road, (4) Daode Oil Shop, Ningbo Road, French Concession, (5) Wanzhengyuan, Li Mei Road, (6) Changde Shop, Rue du Père Robert, (7) Qianfeng West Shop, Haig Road, (8) Xieshengchang, Yangshupu Road, (9) Taishan Shop, Pudong Dongchang Road, (10) Nanshengchang, Nanshi West Gate. After receiving the edible oil, it will be sold according to the prescribed retail method.

Merged into Two Groups A and B

There are a total of 1,830 retailers distributing edible oil in the city, including the public concession, the French concession, Nanshi, Zhabei, Huxi, and Pudong. Now, to facilitate centralized oil sales, they are merged into two groups, A and B: (1) Group A consists of 260 retailers merged into 79 groups, with a total allocation of 520 dan per day, totaling 5,200 dan in ten days. (2) Group B consists of 1,565 small retailers merged into 115 groups, with a total allocation of 510 dan per day, totaling 5,100 dan in ten days.

Oil Collection and Sales Methods and Dates

The Edible Oil Trade Wholesale Office recently issued a notice to all retailers saying, "Regarding the notice, the oil collection method and dates are hereby specified as follows: (1) Group A will sell from the 22nd to the 25th of this month, selling out all the ten days' worth of oil received. (2) Group B will pay in advance from the 21st to the 24th, issue oil on the 25th, and sell oil from the 26th to the 19th, with all sales methods handled in the same way as Group A. This will be repeated thereafter. This notice is hereby given for your information."

Edible Oil Prices and Sales Quantities

All registered edible oil retailers, including oil shops, sauce shops, distilleries, and grocery stores that also sell edible oil, will hang signs at their doors with the edible oil trade wholesale office's price limit, sales quantity, and brand. This time, the ten-day oil supply totals 10,500 dan, all of which is Dalian's high-quality soybean oil. The door-to-door sales price is seven yuan and one jiao per city catty (including tax) and three yuan and five jiao and a half per half catty. The sales quantity is divided into one city catty and half a city catty. Large retailers in Group A can purchase edible oil up to one city catty per person, while small retailers in Group B can purchase half a city catty of edible oil per person.

### Huxi District Bans Charcoal Kilns

Finished Charcoal Allowed to Be Transported and Sold, Authorities Are Planning Proper Methods

Recently, due to the shortage of gasoline and coal, people have set up kilns to refine coke to meet market demand. In the Huxi area, there are more than 80 charcoal kilns. However, the smoke generated during the refining of coke has a great impact on the health of residents. The Huxi Police Department, in view of this, and because the area where the charcoal kilns are located does not comply with the "Provisional Regulations for the Management of Factory Locations" promulgated by the municipal government, and the Municipal Health Bureau has repeatedly requested a ban, and Chinese and foreign residents have also made similar requests, ordered all kilns to stop manufacturing in mid-November to protect residents' health and reported to the municipal government for record. However, considering the merchants' difficulties, the finished charcoal is allowed to be transported and sold in accordance with the simple procedures for ordinary cargo transportation. Recently, it was heard that the authorities are planning proper methods, and most charcoal kilns deeply understand the importance of hygiene and are actively trying to improve charcoal-making equipment in order to resume business.

### After the Implementation of Cloth Registration, Thoroughly Eliminate the Black Market

After the implementation of cloth registration, there are two trends in the market: one is that transactions are in a state of stagnation, and the other is that speculative merchants are still seeking to hoard. In order to quickly restore normal cloth transactions, the relevant parties mostly advocate taking the following measures: (1) Thoroughly eliminate the black market, (2) Continue to restrict the movement of cloth, (3) Cloth sales are limited to manufacturers and actual needs, (4) Restore the cloth exchange, (5) For hoarded cloth, it should be compulsorily purchased at the official price.

### Insurance Industry Regulations to Be Revised

Domei News Agency, this port, reported that the National Government has decided to revise the current Insurance Industry Regulations in the near future, aiming to manage the increase in insurance companies and promote their development. The main points of the revision are that the minimum capital of insurance companies will be increased from 200,000 yuan to 500,000 yuan, the minimum limit for capital used in China will be reduced from 80% to 50%, and foreign insurance companies that were previously prohibited from operating outside the treaty ports will not be subject to this restriction. It is noted that the National Government implemented the Insurance Industry Regulations on October 1 this year, but these regulations were formulated in 1935 and are not fully coordinated with the current situation. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, British and American insurance companies have been reduced, and the number of Chinese insurance companies has suddenly increased by more than 50, totaling about 80.

### Problem of Reopening the Cigarette and Daily Necessities Guild Market Remains Unresolved, Revised Market Rules Still Need Approval from the Authorities

The market for cigarettes, matches, soap, candles, and other items in this city was previously affected by the rising prices of gold thread and various commodities, which were invaded and manipulated by general merchants and speculators, causing the prices of various goods to soar and become unstoppable. The price increase was especially severe for daily necessities. The guild authorities deeply felt that this phenomenon violated the price stabilization policy of the city authorities. In order to suppress prices, they had to voluntarily close the market, and anyone without a guild badge was not allowed to enter. Therefore, in recent times, the general industry has had to conduct guerrilla-style transactions on the road, but because this violates the law, prices have not risen sharply recently. As for the issue of the guild market reopening, according to the Business News Agency reporter, because of various complications, and the issue of re-registering wholesale businesses has not been properly resolved, and the revised market rules must be submitted to the city authorities for approval, it is still difficult to restore it for a while.

The Shanghai Municipal Council Industrial and Social Affairs Department employment introduction section issued a statement yesterday saying that both job search and recruitment are extremely difficult social problems that urgently need to be resolved. Employment introduction is highly valued in all countries around the world. Initially, private organizations were engaged in employment introduction, but recently, it has gradually become a state-run organization. Various public introduction bureaus have been established one after another, actively working to properly solve the two major problems of recruitment and job search. According to this port, there is no public employment introduction agency, and there are two or three private organizations, but they still have little effect in solving the entire problem. The Shanghai Municipal Council Industrial and Social Affairs Department, in view of the sharp increase in the number of unemployed people within the boundary, and the regret that recruiters often have difficulty obtaining suitable talents, has added an employment introduction section to seek social welfare.

Efforts to Achieve

The purpose of this section's efforts are as follows: (1) Private employment introduction often charges a considerable handling fee after introducing a job, which increases the burden on the unemployed poor. This section can correct this abuse and seek the development of employment introduction. (2) Pay attention to selecting and recommending suitable talents to suitable careers, as the original intention of employment introduction. (3) To enable workers to be in suitable positions, so as to reduce the labor mobility rate and increase productivity. (4) To reduce the time and difficulties spent by both recruiters and job seekers. (5) Eliminate the malpractice of employing private individuals, so that the factory organization is sound and increases productivity. (6) Strive to assist recruiters and job seekers in various places outside the port to obtain reasonable solutions. (7) For the future development of the industrial world, prepare to adjust workers and technicians. (8) Reduce the number of unemployed citizens to maintain concession security and improve social life.

Introduction Procedures

As for the introduction procedures, it is divided into two items: (1) Recruiters, all major factories and institutions that entrust the search for talents must fill out the recruitment ticket prepared by this section in detail. This section often strives to introduce job seekers who meet the qualifications to the recruitment agency for an interview in the shortest possible time. Adoption or rejection must be stated clearly in the attached "Adoption or Rejection Declaration Form" and returned to this section. If there are no suitable talents, this section will immediately reply and reject them. (2) Job seekers, those who entrust the introduction of a job must come to this section in person to fill out a job application ticket. After talking with the staff of this section, registration will be given, and two recent two-inch photos of the half body must be prepared and brought. After registration, if there is a suitable position and it is considered that it can be introduced, this section will notify the job seeker to prepare the introduction letter of this section and go to the application in person.

Job Search Registration

The current work of this section is to accept the entrustment of major factories and institutions to find suitable talents and to handle the registration of unemployed technical talents. It starts with industrial technicians and mechanical technicians. The office of this section is as follows: Recruitment Liaison Office, 3rd Floor, Shanghai Municipal Council, No. 180 Fuzhou Road, Tel. 15349, Job Search Registration Office, 620 Gongchu, No. 209 Jiangxi Road, Shanghai Municipal Council. Registration will be handled from the 21st of this month. Office hours are from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM, Saturday from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM, and Sunday is closed. Moreover, this section must state that (1) The introduction of jobs in this section is purely for social service, and no fees are charged for all procedures. (2) For the introduction of jobs, this section only fulfills the obligation of introduction and does not bear any guarantee responsibility. Regarding the guarantee procedures, the recruitment agency and the job seeker will directly contact each other. (3) Those who have registered, if this section fails to introduce a job, shall not ask this section for inquiries. (4) Job seekers who have registered should immediately report to this section and automatically cancel the job search registration after finding a job by themselves.

### Chinese Stocks Hard to Save - Food Stocks Alone Show a Good Face

Yesterday, the Chinese stock market situation deteriorated further. The main factors were tightening credit and an increase in buyers seeking cash. Although investors tried to take advantage of low prices, they were limited by their strength and found it difficult to reverse the downward trend. It is feared that there will be little hope of a turnaround before the Lunar New Year. Among food stocks, Guanshengyuan was in demand, rising 20 yuan to reach 420-430 yuan. Merlin Food was around 1200 yuan, with a significant difference between buying and selling prices. Kang Yuan Canned Food traded around 50 yuan. In the cultural sector, only the Commercial Press saw a slight increase, rising 5 yuan. Zhonghua rose slightly by 10 yuan, and Shijie by 2 yuan. Public utilities were in a slump, with Zhabei Water and Electricity falling to the 60 yuan mark, down 1.5 yuan. China Electric was at a low of 39.75 yuan. In the new pharmaceutical sector, Minyi fell to 72.5 yuan, then another 5 yuan, and then another 6.5 yuan. Sino-French fell by 1 yuan, and Xinyi recovered slightly by 12.5 yuan. Sino-Western traded at 450 yuan. In the department store sector, Sincere and Wing On each fell by 4 yuan, and National Goods Company was down by 1 yuan. In the textile sector, Wing On Textile fell by 60-70 yuan, and Dasheng No. 1 and No. 3 factories also declined. Among the small stocks, only Mei Lun Wool rose to 13.5 yuan. The other weaving stocks were flat and weak. Rong Feng fell sharply to 49 yuan. Great China Matches fell slightly by 5 yuan to 375 yuan. Nanyang Tobacco also fell by 3 yuan. Financial stocks still had few sellers, and although no transactions occurred, prices were rising. The market price list is below:

### Bond Market Apathetic

Bond trading is becoming increasingly sluggish, with a general feeling that there are sellers but no buyers. The general public is not very interested in this and dares not buy it. The stricter the control, the more difficult it is to excite people for the time being. Yesterday's market prices were 5.12 yuan for A bonds, 4.2 yuan for B bonds, 6.12 yuan for C bonds, 1.56 yuan for D bonds, and 3.12 yuan for E bonds. These are all asking prices and not actual transaction prices. Only C bonds had some transactions. Due to tight credit and the upcoming New Year, the trend may become even lower.

### Jewelry Gold Supply Less Than Demand - Interbank Interest Rate Up Another Point

Yesterday, the listed exchange rate for jewelry gold in Shanghai pawnshops remained at 3,100 yuan per tael (with a reduction of about 300 yuan for purchases). The unofficial interbank market price shifted from firm to weak, starting at 2,905 yuan in the morning, up 35 yuan, then dropping by 10 yuan and gradually falling to 2,800 yuan in a selling trend. At noon, it recovered slightly to 2,850 yuan, with supply exceeding demand and a slight increase of 20 yuan. Transactions were sparse. The listed price for jewelry silver remained at 16 yuan per tael, with interbank trading prices between 17 yuan and 7.5 yuan.

The Money Trade Association's interbank lending rate rose another point to 2.6 cents.

### Military Notes Settlement Reduced - United Bank Notes Continue to Decline

Yesterday, the price of military notes to sugar merchants stabilized after the initial rush. The selling price at pawnshops and small money shops was reduced to 5.56 yuan, with a purchase price of 5.5 yuan. Interbank trading prices were between 5.55 and 5.57. United Bank notes fell slightly by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan, with buying and selling prices at 3.85 and 3.9 yuan, respectively. It is said that the price in Bengbu is only 3.33 yuan.

### Heavy Coarse Cloth - Asking Price Higher

Yesterday, the factory cloth market tightened, and prices varied. Due to shortages, the asking price for 16-pound Earth brand heavy coarse cloth was 280 yuan, and 270 yuan for Flying Goose, but there were few transactions. 14-pound Earth brand coarse cloth traded at 233 yuan. 9-pound New Character was priced at 145 yuan, 8-pound Zhenzhong at 137 yuan, and 10-pound Earth brand fine cloth at 195 yuan. Fugui fine cloth was priced at 191 yuan and Dapeng at 194 yuan, but there were very few transactions. Peach Blossom Ms. Lin's mid-day closing price was 320.5 yuan, and Chick was 315 yuan, with some demand for purchases.

The East cloth market was stable. The bank order price for 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was as high as 200 yuan, with a mid-day closing price of 199.75 yuan. The new Dragon Head order was 98.75 yuan, Colorful Ball was 199.25 yuan, and Flying Fish, Yang He, and Trumpet were priced around 199 yuan, with no gains or losses. The opening price for Four Gentlemen Serge Red Order was 7.92 yuan, falling to 7.88 yuan, and then rising to 7.91 yuan, a slight increase of 0.04 yuan.

### Wool Fabric Trading Not Weak

Wool fabric trading is not weak. Actual sales are limited, but wholesale trading is still continuous. The demand for smooth fabrics made of fine wool, plain solid colors, and summer wool fabrics exceeds supply, and the market is consistently high. Yesterday, 401 Riding Breeches was 240 yuan, 1 to 28 was 285 yuan, Yin Feng Blue Character Tuskan Jin was 290 yuan, White Character was 270 yuan, 456 Fancy Serge was 142.5 yuan, 135 was 209 yuan, 101 Thin Plain Serge was 170 yuan, 201 Gongni was 230 yuan, 301 Hua Da Ni was 227-228 yuan, 129 Yu Sha Ni was 155 yuan, American Hair Palikees was 160 yuan, American Feng Overcoat was 270 yuan, and White Edge Color Tzi Gong was 375 yuan.

### Coarse Grains Supply and Demand Balanced

The market for coarse grains is fairly balanced in terms of supply and demand. The market started weak but ended strong, with beans showing some strength and bean cakes slightly lower. Chongming Sand Yellow traded at 340 to 350 yuan for 30 bags, and Sand Red traded at 345 yuan for new goods and 280 yuan for old goods for 20 bags. Wujiang selected green traded at 310 yuan for 15 bags. Wuhu Corn traded at 348 yuan for old goods and 360 yuan for new goods for over 100 bags. Yuan Long bean cake traded at 81 to 81.75 yuan for two cars, Fei Zi bean cake traded at 83 to 82 yuan for three cars, and Changji bean cake traded at 82 yuan for 300 pieces.

### Xinghua Siyuan Arrival Slightly Increased

The market for Xinghua Siyuan has gradually stabilized recently due to a slight increase in arrivals. Openings have been frequent in recent days, with fluctuations of several hundred yuan between high-quality and ordinary goods. However, compared to miscellaneous goods, they are still in the high price range. The price of Tong'an goods has decreased by one-quarter from previous levels, and the market situation has temporarily stabilized.

### Agar Shortage Keeps Prices High

The inventory of agar is gradually decreasing, so the market is still firm even though it is not the peak season. Some parties are taking advantage of low prices to buy in, indicating that the market is unlikely to ease in the future. Yesterday, Tiansue Brand traded at 4600 yuan, and Ice Mark traded at 5900 yuan.

### Cigarette Market Brewing

The cigarette market is in a stalemate. Although the supply is ample and price controls are strict, most owners are unwilling to sell at a loss and are determined to hold firm. Buyers are watching and not entering the market due to year-end accounting. The market is brewing. British Brand traded at 9200 yuan, Old Blade Brand at 8300 yuan, Pin Hai Brand at 8100 yuan, Fairy Brand at 7700 yuan, Five Hua Brand at 6600 yuan, Japanese Tobacco Golden Gun Brand at 2800 yuan, Golden Building at 3200 yuan, Red Rose at 5200 yuan, Quan Lu Brand at 2850 yuan, Guide Brand at 2300 yuan, National Tobacco Beautiful Brand at 5600 yuan, Golden Mouse Brand at 3750 yuan, and White Golden Dragon at 3800 yuan.

### Daily Necessities Few Transactions Outside Market

There are very few transactions of daily necessities outside the market, so prices remain calm. Phoenix Brand traded at 2950 yuan, Beautiful Brand at 3150 yuan, Guben Soap at 500 yuan, White Xiangmao Soap at 480 yuan, Yellow Xiangmao Soap at 390 yuan, Scissors Soap at 490 yuan, and White Rice's Foreign Candle at 375 yuan. Sellers are still weak.

### After Expanding its Organization - A Visit to the Chinese-Owned Watson's Drug Factory

— Bi Shi

The other day, at the invitation of my friend Zhou Shihuang, I visited Watson's Drug Factory. The name "Watson's" is commonly mistaken by ordinary people as the name of a foreign merchant, which I also thought before. After the visit, I realized that this "Watson's Drug Factory" is not only capitalized by Chinese shares but also has Chinese technicians. It can be said to be a product of purely Chinese business operations. However, the ingredients and efficacy of their products have the characteristic of "surpassing" imported products. This time, I visited the old Watson's factory on the Museum Road and the new factory in the Tongfu Xieqiao Lane. I deeply felt the grand scale and strict management. I am a complete layman in terms of equipment and technology, and I can only praise it. This article only describes its external outline.

Recent Factory Affairs

Watson's Drug Factory was only established a year ago. It was founded by financial circles and people from the medical and pharmaceutical industries. It established its own manufacturing plant in Shanghai and purchased new Western machinery and disinfection equipment to refine various Western medicines, such as injections, pills, tablets, powders, and Western medicine raw materials. Because the products are excellent, they have gained the trust of the medical and pharmaceutical industries and the public. Recently, due to strong demand from all parties, the original products were not enough for distribution. Since last month, the factory decided to expand its organization, increase capital, with a total amount of 4 million yuan, which has been fully paid up. The capital increase procedures have all been completed. Based on the original foundation, and with more substantial strength, striving forward, the future will naturally be very great. I cannot but admire the flexible and skillful handling of the few people in charge of the factory in the financial world.

Many Talents

In modern times, all kinds of enterprises need capital to achieve great success; specialized talents are needed to achieve satisfactory results. But looking at the few outstanding talents in Watson's Drug Factory, one can predict future achievements. For example, Chairman Wu Ruiyuan is the chairman of Tongyi Yarn Factory, Chongxin Yarn Factory, Yida Yarn Store, and Yongda Bank; Managing Director and General Manager Wu Deru is also with Yongda Bank; Director Yang Zhangding is the General Manager of Yongda Bank and Chairman of Xin Yi Dyeing and Weaving Factory; Ren Yuanzi is the Branch Manager of China South Bank; Yuan Dunzi is the Factory Manager of Tongyi Yarn Factory; Directors Wu Xunqing, Dong Chunfang, Liang Yongquan, Ling Menghua, Yu Xuexin, Xu Juheng, etc., are all pioneers in the business world. Supervisor Zeng Yaozhong is a medical doctor who studied in Germany; there are also several engineers and pharmacists who are specialized technicians. With so much human and financial resources gathered together, working together for the cause, everything is naturally optimistic.

A Glimpse of Products

Watson's Drug Factory has more than ten famous products, such as (1) "Insulin," a special injection for the treatment of diabetes. It is the only drug in China for treating diabetes. Therefore, the demand from all parties is very strong. The authorities in the Shanghai Public Concession and the French Concession attach great importance to this drug and will implement distribution controls to avoid hoarding in the market. On the one hand, they urge the factory to increase production and raise prices. (2) "Bailixue," which specializes in treating anemia, (3) "Ruhuang Ling," which mainly treats women's menstrual problems, (4) A pregnancy test reagent for women, "Jisita Ding," can be used for intradermal injection to test for pregnancy within ten minutes, with an accuracy rate of 96%. This method can be performed by doctors in outpatient clinics or at any time in patients' homes. (5) Famous medicines such as "Vitamin D Calcium" and "Ponto Calcium," "Typhoid" and "Cholera" vaccines for the treatment of tuberculosis, have long been unanimously advocated by famous doctors at sea.

Latest Plan

Watson's Drug Factory has a large number of Western medicine raw materials, preparing to manufacture various essential household medicines to contribute to society and relieve the suffering of patients. Currently, the drugs that have been successfully tested but have not yet been manufactured and distributed include: (1) Liver preparations for injection, (2) Sulfapyridine for injection and oral administration, (3) Artificial blood transfusion agents, (4) Contraceptives, (5) Blood clotting agents, (6) Germicidal ointments, (7) Remedies for bedwetting in children, (8) Frostbite ointment, etc. After all kinds of products are completed, the factory will set up branches and distribution offices in major cities and is preparing to build a third factory in West Shanghai, the address of which has already been selected.

Future Prospects

The outline of Watson's Drug Factory has been described above. In my observation, they have great hope of success in the future. Looking at the following points, one can be certain: First, the people in charge of the factory are all giants in the industrial and commercial world with outstanding reputations. Like this capital increase, it is simply as easy as turning one's hand. With strong capital, the development of the business will naturally be as convenient as sailing with the current. Second, they are all entrepreneurs who can help each other in the spirit of cooperation. The so-called "many hands make light work" and "unity is strength." If they can persist in this way, hope is boundless. Third, the technicians in the factory are all German-trained chemists and pharmacists who have extremely profound knowledge in drug research. They neither produce crudely nor cut corners, which is very different from ordinary speculative merchants. In this case, the increase in the price of Watson's stock, the sales of medicines, and the publicity of reputation are, of course, just around the corner. (Advertisement)

### Praise and Criticism of Money

— Tuo Si

Whenever money is mentioned, it seems to unconsciously remind people that it is a foul, despicable thing. In today's era where economics is above all else, these old-fashioned Confucian concepts should no longer exist. Even now, there are still many people who love money as much as their lives in private, but on the surface, they have to pretend to be upright and self-respecting. They start talking about "not getting ill-gotten gains" or "money is the root of all evil." Mr. Lu Xun said very sharply: "Those who acknowledge that rice needs to be bought with money, but say that money is despicable, if you can press on their stomach, there is probably still fish and meat that has not been digested. They must be starved for a day before listening to their arguments."

In all fairness, money may indeed have the sin of all evil, but it only shows the breadth of its effectiveness and the magnitude of its power. At least money itself should not bear this responsibility. For example, a knife can be used to cut vegetables and firewood, but it can also be used to cut off a person's head. However, we have never heard anyone curse the knife for being this or that. If money knew, it should plead for itself: "I am only responsible for economic matters, and moral issues are irrelevant to me."

Schopenhauer said it most frankly: "Everything else can only satisfy one desire of a person, but only money is absolutely good because it abstractly satisfies all desires." Although, the word "abstract" can be called the "Spring and Autumn brushwork." Philosophers probably all have this ability. Readers must not ignore this small place to understand its subtleties.

Rousseau uses the same statement, but expresses a completely opposite view: "Money is something that is never as precious to me as it is to others, and I cannot feel how convenient it is... I love money less passionately than I love goods because there is always something between spare money and desire, but there is nothing else between goods and enjoyment." By comparison, obviously, we would rather agree with Schopenhauer's frankness than like Rousseau's far-fetchedness. Naturalists are often more contrived than unnatural ones, which is easier for bystanders to see clearly.

The humorous Bernard Shaw undoubtedly has an extraordinary view of money. Sure enough, we found the sentence: "Money is the most important thing in the world. Wealth represents health, strength, credibility, beauty..." "Love of money is the root of all morality." - Shaw is the world's highest-paid writer and also the richest writer: he has hundreds of thousands of pounds in the bank, but he never gives a penny to beggars or other charities. He replied to people: "Money is only a tool of security and freedom for me. If society can give me these two things, I will throw all my money out the window."

Money can indeed lead people to safety and freedom, but think about it, wouldn't too much money make them lose it? Unconditional praise of money is very dangerous. Now try to listen to another playwright's statement; Ibsen: "Money can buy the outer shell of everything, but not its essence. It can give you food, but not appetite; it can give you medicine, but not health; it can give you friends, but not friendship; it can give you servants, but not loyalty; it can give you great pleasure, but not tranquility and joy." These few words fully illustrate the superficiality, indirectness, and abstraction of money.

Perhaps the words of literary scholars are always scratching the surface and not getting to the point. Coincidentally, there is a famous theory of the American steel king Charles M. Schwab: "Much money cannot bring happiness. One of the greatest happinesses in life is to look forward to the future, to always have something that is outside of what you are about to achieve, and to always have something that you cannot get. If a person has reached the state of affluence where he can buy everything with just a check, then his happiness will gradually disappear. I have obtained many joys in my life that money cannot bring." This can be said to be an excellent philosophy of money, and I hope that every rich person can understand and benefit from it.

In the end, Schopenhauer's words are correct again: money is good, but it is useless to want money alone in life unless I know how to turn it into pleasure: this is an art that requires cultivation and wisdom. Sensory enjoyment can never satisfy us, only the pleasure of wisdom and understanding will never be boring: therefore, "those who have no spiritual needs are called philistines."

No one on the street pays much attention to Wei Cheng's actions. Whether he walks slowly or quickly, no one pays attention. Even when he walks out of the city, no one chases after him to stop him. Xian, with a wounded heart, constantly moves his footsteps. Walking and walking again, he actually arrived home. Ah Xing opened the door and saw that it was Wei Cheng. He couldn't help but exclaim, "Young master is back! Young master, you must have made a fortune!" Wei Cheng walked inside, and Ah Xing was still waiting for Huang Long at the door. Second Madam Ye and Cui Zhen were murmuring about Wei Cheng. Hearing that Wei Cheng had returned, how could they not be happy? Like Ah Xing, they blurted out a question about Huang Long. Although Wei Cheng was not crestfallen, he was not very happy either. He only replied, "He didn't come back." Second Madam Ye asked him where he had been these past two days. Wei Cheng said that he had gone to a few gambling dens just to see the world and hadn't bet heavily or lost big.

After dinner, Wei Cheng forced a smile to reassure Second Madam Ye and Cui Zhen. He returned to his bedroom alone and shook his head for almost a few minutes, muttering to himself, "Why am I so useless? Getting to the door and suddenly running back, what does that mean? Guo Fang has returned to Shuangqiao Town, which is something I've been hoping for. Can't I pretend that nothing happened and talk to her? Further, can't I pull out a knife and kill her?" Wei Cheng slapped his forehead, full of regret. That night, he felt that Huang Long had returned, and he was thinking about what to say to him. He took out the knife and looked at it, almost stabbing himself in the throat. He covered himself with the quilt and began to sob. He lay in until dawn, fell asleep, got out of bed around, and didn't dare to go to Shuangmei's room to look at his parents' portraits. In the evening, Huang Long returned. As soon as he entered, he asked Ah Xing if Wei Cheng had returned. Ah Xing told him that he had returned last night. Huang Long ran straight inside, saw Wei Cheng, his face flushed, and asked, "You, you, you, why did you come back?" Wei Cheng had thought about it over and over again, so he only lightly replied, "I was afraid that my family would worry about me, so I came back. Coming back doesn't mean I can't go again. It doesn't matter, please tell me about the situation in Shanghai." (249)

### An Account of a Visit to the Divine Soldiers of the Gaoligong Mountains (3)

— Translated by Jie Feng

(Originally published in the Yomiuri Hochi on December 6th)

Dispatch from the Yomiuri Hochi reporter dispatched by the Imperial Headquarters Army Press Department (From a certain place on the Sino-Burmese border)

I woke up at 6:30 AM. This is according to Japanese time; in Burma, it's 4:00 AM. I put on two shirts, turned up the collars, and hurried to the train station in the moonlight. At the station, there were seventeen freight cars, like matchboxes, crowded together darkly on the platform, which had no lights. After the train started, the sky gradually brightened around 8:30 AM. The train climbed one mountain after another with great anxiety, going up and down repeatedly. Along the route was the Xiang Plateau, reminiscent of autumn scenery in Japan. After the train left the Nalaikong station, it quickly descended, soon arriving at the Gokteik station. This is the most dangerous point on the entire Burmese railway and also a scenic wonder of the world. Between two towering mountains, there is a deep valley, spanned by a long-legged iron bridge. The bridge is 650 meters long, 96 meters from the base of the bridge's foundation on the rock to the top of the bridge, and 300 meters from the water surface. The enemy didn't have time to destroy this iron bridge when they retreated, which shows how swift our army's advance was.

At 6:00 PM, I boarded a tarpaulin-covered military cargo truck and set off for Lashio. This was a dangerous night march, as we were likely to be ambushed by enemy aircraft. Soldiers of the Hirai Unit, which had performed many outstanding feats, were in the cargo truck with us. About an hour later, we arrived at Hsenwi.

After leaving Hsenwi town, we started up a mountain road. On this mountain, on the grass, everywhere was stained with the fresh blood of our comrades. More than forty captured vehicles were there. The cargo truck sped forward at a speed of fifty kilometers per hour, and soon we reached the summit. At the foot of the mountain was the town of Kutkai. Piles of destroyed enemy cargo trucks were stacked on both sides of the street. On May 1st, the Hirai Unit, which had annihilated a division of Chinese troops in Hsenwi, also disrupted the enemy's formation in this Kutkai town, ensuring the safety of the Nankai suspension bridge. A soldier of the Hirai Unit in the truck said:

"From this valley, two enemy cargo trucks, burning, rolled down!"

"At this bend, the enemy's abandoned corpses are piled up like mountains..." and so on.

After first clashing with the 87th Regiment of the 29th Division of Chongqing, inflicting a devastating blow and returning in triumph, the great achievements of the Hirai Unit even reached the ears of the Emperor.

At 11:30 PM, under the moonlight, we left the Meng-Yu three-way intersection. Further ahead was the Burma Road, directly connecting to the Huitong Bridge on the Sino-Burmese border. To the left was the flat road to Bhamo. There, the Nankai Great Suspension Bridge, which had been secured by the Hirai Unit just before it was destroyed, was located.

At 12:10 AM, we arrived at the border town, Wanting. Until the opening of the Burma Road in September of Showa 13 (1938), this was just a small village with two or three families. Truly a town established overnight. A small stream flows between the mountains shared by Burma and Yunnan. At the foot of the mountain, the border is connected by a bridge twenty meters long. When I think of a border, I imagine a solemn boundary, but in reality, it couldn't be more simple. On this dark, unlit border street, I stood with a blanket covering my head to my feet. My eyes, accustomed to the darkness, immediately caught sight of faint lights two hundred meters ahead. That was the security forces headquarters. I approached and saw six soldiers in a Chinese house with a sloping roof, holding a thin memorial service, keeping watch over the spirit of a comrade who had died of malaria. I went in and greeted them, then stood upright before the altar, bowing repeatedly to pray for the departed's happiness in the afterlife.
