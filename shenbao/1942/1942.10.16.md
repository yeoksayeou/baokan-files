### Soviet Reinforcements Launched Counter-Offensive on Stalino Again, Fierce Fighting Erupted; Heavy Snow on Caucasus Peaks, Germany Claims Capture of Numerous Fortified Positions

German Führer Headquarters, 15th, Hái Tōng News Agency Wire

This afternoon's German war report stated that German and Slovak troops, after fierce fighting with enemy forces in the mountainous areas of the Caucasus, broke through enemy lines and captured over 500 enemy fortresses. Enemy troops in the Terek region were forced to retreat. German infantry and mechanized units shattered the resistance of Soviet troops in Stalingrad, penetrating deep into the city's northern sector. German aircraft continuously bombed enemy fortresses and artillery positions with great success. The enemy's diversionary attacks were repelled by German forces, and the enemy suffered heavy losses. Transportation activities and transit centers downstream of the Volga were also subjected to aerial bombardment, with one oil tanker and two barges hit and set ablaze. On the Don River front, Romanian troops repelled localized enemy offensives. In the central sector of the Eastern Front, German assault troops destroyed numerous enemy pillboxes and strongholds. German aircraft bombed vital Soviet railway lines, inflicting heavy losses on enemy rolling stock.

Military observers here stated that, apart from the Tuapse line, the Eastern Front is generally calm. The Red Army is continuing its counter-offensive northwest of Stalingrad and has transferred a large number of fresh troops from the Volga River to reinforce. The fighting in the Mozdok area has eased somewhat, and the German side has also confirmed a temporary lull in the fighting there. The Red Army's attempts to cross the Terek River have been unsuccessful. German forces in the Tuapse area have made further advances and have reached the outer perimeter of the port. According to Soviet military expert Colonel Grushav, the fighting in the Stalingrad area will continue. The German army is in great need in other theaters and cannot be transferred to Stalino, and the Red Army maintains offensive operations in the areas around Stalino, preventing the German army from redeploying. In short, the main purpose of the Red Army's spring offensive in various areas in recent days is to reduce the pressure on the Red Army in Stalino.

Berlin, 15th, Havas News Agency Wire

According to the latest news from the Eastern Front, the fighting in the Stalino area has intensified again. Many German bombers and dive bombers participated in the operations. On the Tuapse front, German forces occupied several important high mountains yesterday. The peaks are covered with snow. The Red Army launched repeated counterattacks, but all failed. Two Red Army battalions were annihilated.

Somewhere on the Ukrainian Border, 15th, Havas News Agency Wire

Observers here recently analyzed the situation on the Eastern Front: (1) There are no major battles in the Stalino area. German forces are only constantly bombarding the Red Army's positions with heavy artillery. The Red Army continues to resist behind every roof and wall. All the houses in the city have become fortresses. In the north of the city, the Red Army continues to advance along the Kachalinskaya-Dubovka line. The Red Army troops that crossed the river in the northern Don River bend have not made any further progress and are only holding one bridgehead, posing a significant threat to the north-south transportation lines of the German forces. (2) There is still fierce fighting in the Tuapse area of the western Caucasus. The vanguard of the German forces reached the Black Sea coast south of Veliaminovskaia and came into contact with the Red Army. The Soviet light fleet also participated in the operations. (3) It is reported that the German forces fighting near Georgievskaya were obstructed en route and even abandoned some strongholds. However, neutral observers believe that the reason why the fighting in that area has entered a state of standstill is not only due to the effective resistance of the Red Army, but also due to the harsh climate and rugged terrain. In short, the erratic actions of the two armies on the Eastern Front increasingly lead people to believe that the war in 1942 is coming to an end. The current campaigns are merely to correct protruding positions to prevent them from being taken advantage of by the enemy. Therefore, both sides are extremely cautious when conducting local attacks at any location, clearly wanting to reduce losses of soldiers and military equipment.

Somewhere on the Soviet Border, 14th, Havas News Agency Wire

The Soviet government organ, Pravda, recently published an editorial advocating for making efforts to fully utilize non-Russian nationalities in front-line operations. It stated that the living conditions of non-Russian troops should be kept as similar to those in their hometowns as possible within the range of possibility. Many of these people are not proficient in Russian, so it is requested that people of their own nationalities be appointed as officers. In addition, the training of new recruits is inadequate and should be greatly reformed.

After being expelled from the areas on the West Coast, the Japanese residents were detained in inland concentration camps. Their locations were not conducive to health, and some were even detained in stables. Monthly stipends for labor performed by the Japanese residents were divided into three types: eight dollars, twelve dollars, and sixteen dollars.

### Willkie Reaffirmed the Need to Open a Second Front Quickly, Met with Roosevelt at the White House the Night Before to Report on His Trip to Various Countries

Buenos Aires, Argentina, 15th, Domei News Agency Wire

U.S. Presidential Envoy Willkie, who had visited Moscow and Chongqing, among other places, returned to Washington yesterday afternoon and will report on his trip to President Roosevelt.

Buenos Aires, 14th, Central News Agency Wire

According to a dispatch from Washington, Special Envoy Willkie returned to Washington on the 14th and met with President Roosevelt at the White House in the afternoon to report on the detailed situation during his visits to Moscow, North Africa, West Asia, and Chongqing.

Lisbon, 15th, Domei News Agency Wire

According to a report from Washington, Willkie, after traveling to the Soviet Union and other countries, saw reporters today and reiterated his remarks in Moscow, saying that a second front should be opened as soon as possible within the range of possibility. Willkie, regardless of the severe criticism from domestic leaders and the press, repeatedly stated that his announcement of the opening of a second front was based on the opinions of military experts from various countries he had visited. He declined to comment on whether Stalin would be satisfied with the opening of a second front by the Ming (Chinese) people. It is said that Willkie will make a detailed report on this trip after a brief rest in Indiana.

Lisbon, 15th, Hái Tōng News Agency Wire

Willkie stated to President Roosevelt today after reporting on his duties that the United States should continue to work hard to achieve victory. This was the impression he gained from his recent travels. Willkie continued that he has always advocated that the Allied forces should establish a supreme command, and General MacArthur would be the most suitable candidate.

### Policy Toward the Soviet Union Still to Be Decided

Tokyo, 15th, Central News Agency Wire

According to Yomiuri Hochi, a special cable from Stockholm, Sweden, stated that Roosevelt's envoy Willkie arrived in Washington on the 14th after visiting the United Nations and reported to Roosevelt on his trip and discussed the requests of Chongqing and the Soviet Union. In addition, U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Stanley is also arriving in Washington recently. Therefore, Roosevelt will decide on his policy toward the Soviet Union after listening to the opinions of the two. While in Moscow and Chongqing, Willkie repeatedly stated that it was urgent to promote U.S. aid to Chongqing and the Soviet Union. Stanley also inadvertently revealed to a group of reporters while passing through Tehran that the Soviet authorities were eagerly awaiting U.S. aid. Therefore, it is expected that the two will report and propose to Roosevelt the increase of the supply of military supplies to the Soviet Union and the rapid deployment of the second front. In addition, some people in Washington political circles are rumored that the Soviet Union has strongly demanded the establishment of a joint Anglo-American-Soviet supreme command. Therefore, how Roosevelt will respond is worth noting. Although Roosevelt claimed in this "fireside chat" that the strategy of the United Nations had been decided and announced that a new offensive would be launched against Japan and Germany, such words were merely perfunctory. As The Times published a dispatch from Washington stating that it is not easy for Britain and the United States to satisfy the Soviet Union and Chongqing at the same time, this is a very difficult practical problem. According to sources, Roosevelt's new offensive is actually extremely difficult to launch a second front in Europe. Therefore, it is expected that although the second front will be urged by both Chongqing and the Soviet Union, its purpose, region, and significance of expansion are not clear.

Lisbon, 15th, Hái Tōng News Agency Wire

### Bulgarian Capital Held Anti-Communist Exhibition, the Soviet Union Issued a Serious Protest

Sofia, 15th, Hái Tōng News Agency Wire

Authoritative sources here revealed that regarding the anti-communist exhibition held in the Bulgarian capital, the Soviet Union has lodged a serious protest with the Bulgarian government, pointing out that such anti-Soviet propaganda is incompatible with the existence of diplomatic relations between the two countries and hoping that the Bulgarian government will pay attention to it. The protest letter did not mention Germany, which is quite noteworthy. After receiving the protest, the Bulgarian government sent a reply to the Soviet government, informing it that the anti-communist exhibition was not against the Soviet Union, but against Bolshevism. The Soviet government has repeatedly stated that it is not responsible for communist activities in Europe. Therefore, the Soviet protest is obviously lacking in basis.

Vichy, 15th, Havas News Agency Wire

The Colonial Department recently issued a war report on Madagascar stating that the British government originally thought that it would be able to occupy Madagascar in less than two weeks. It was learned that 35 days later, the British army was still trying to overcome the resolute resistance of the defenders. The other side used various methods to coerce the residents of the island. For example, the radio of the British General Command announced that if anyone engaged in any resistance or sabotage, they would be severely punished once discovered. Then, on the 13th of this month, it decisively dispatched aircraft to use machine guns to strafe the town of Fianarantsoa, which had no military targets whatsoever. This action has aroused the anger of the islanders. The British army has had the opportunity to confirm that our resistance in Anbasitra City is by no means symbolic. But on the 13th of this month, this impression was further confirmed. Although Prime Minister Churchill made a full promise that the British army still had to make significant efforts to reach its goal, but on that day, even those who went all out failed to overcome the resistance of the French army. Although the enemy launched an unstoppable flanking attack, broke into the city at night, and launched a fierce frontal assault, our army still retained its original positions and launched fierce counterattacks several times. By evening, the defenders were still repulsing all the British offensives with fierce artillery fire.

Approximately 300 to 400 people participated and lasted for two hours.

### Self-Defense Corps Sets Off on Parade

Heavy Security

The holding of a 100,000-person rally in the Racecourse can be described as its prelude. Yesterday, from 1:00 PM, the area around Jing'an Temple Road, Mohawk Road, Nanjing Road, and Yu Qiaqing Road was placed under alert. The nearby Japanese Military Police dispatched personnel to stand guard around the Racecourse and inside the grounds. The Shanghai Municipal Police also mobilized a large number of detectives of Chinese, Japanese, Indian, and Western nationalities to set up posts inside and outside the venue. In addition, there were reserve teams and five red police vehicles stationed at the entrance of the Racecourse on Mohawk Road. Soon after, members of the Self-Defense Corps from various districts, including Central, Xinzha, Laoza, Chengdu, Jing'an, Gordon, and Putuo, converged from all directions. Order was maintained by the inspection teams organized by each district, and they entered the venue in an orderly fashion.

Opening Ceremony

The conference began at 3:30 PM, presided over by Cheng Zhiliang, a standing director of the Baojia Guidance Committee. The Chinese and Japanese national flags and the Baojia flag were raised, and the Chinese and Japanese national anthems and the Baojia anthem were played during the flag-raising. The audience then gave the highest salute to the national flag, followed by a minute of silence for the martyrs. Afterwards, 100,000 people sang the Baojia anthem together. Wang Boyuan, vice president of the Baojia Guidance Committee, then delivered an opening speech. Subsequently, Mr. Okazaki, the Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, the Chief of Police, and the Deputy Director-General, Yuan Ludeng, delivered speeches praising the success of the eight-month Baojia Self-Defense organization, with many words of encouragement. The guest speakers included Major General Fuse of the Garrison Headquarters, Colonel Kamata, head of the Naval Information Department, and Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama, head of the Army Information Department. Wu Yunqi, representing the Chief of the Joint Baojia, then delivered a thank-you speech.

Declaration of Establishment

If I violate this oath, I am willing to accept punishment. I solemnly swear." With this, the Self-Defense Corps was officially established. Under the leadership of Cheng Zhiliang, the crowd shouted slogans: "The Self-Defense Corps is the fortress of the citizens themselves! Establishing Baojia is self-defense, self-determination, and self-protection! Members of the Self-Defense Corps should have high moral character! Members of the Self-Defense Corps must have the spirit to endure hardship! Members of the Self-Defense Corps, unite! Long live the Republic of China!" After the meeting, 50,000 to 60,000 members of the Self-Defense Corps who participated in the conference, wearing official armbands, set off on a parade led by the bands from each district. The route was Jing'an Temple Road, Nanjing Road, the Bund, Fuzhou Road, Racecourse Road, Weihaiwei Road, Seymour Road, and back to Jing'an Temple Road, ending at dusk.

### Pawnshops and Pawn Businesses Plan to Refuse Items Pledged Without Citizen Certificates

Local pawnshops and pawn businesses believe that Articles 8, 13, and 16 of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Regulations for the Management of Pawnshops and Pawn Businesses are difficult to implement. Yesterday, after a continued meeting, it was decided that, as citizen certificates in the two concessions have not yet been fully issued, residents who cannot present a citizen certificate will be temporarily refused pledge items. At the same time, a petition will be drafted and representatives will be sent to the Shanghai Municipal Council to request revisions in order to maintain the pawnshop business and benefit the turnover of the poor.

### Nationals of Countries at War with or Having Severed Relations with Japan Prohibited from Entering Entertainment Venues

The regulations have been promulgated and implemented since yesterday. Cafes and restaurants are still permitted.

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reported that the Japanese authorities have issued new regulations, effective from yesterday, prohibiting foreign nationals in Shanghai from countries at war with or having severed relations with Japan from entering entertainment venues. Mr. Masaki, the Chief Translator of the Japanese Consulate-General, clarified several points of these regulations yesterday morning.

Entrance to the Racecourse Prohibited

When the reporter first inquired whether enemy aliens were prohibited from entering the Racecourse, sports grounds, and participating in racing, Masaki replied in the affirmative. From now on, they are prohibited from entering sports grounds and race clubs and participating in any sports or entertainment in the Racecourse. Cafes and restaurants are still permitted for enemy aliens, but this does not apply to those with entertainment facilities. The French Concession Police Department will post notices in the concession prohibiting enemy aliens from entering certain places, while the Public Concession will have patrolmen stationed outside these places to prevent misunderstandings.

Enemy Alien Employees Must Be Dismissed

When the reporter inquired about enemy aliens who own or are employed in entertainment venues, Masaki said that enemy alien employees must be dismissed. The issue of enemy alien owners is still under discussion, and a solution has not yet been decided. Boxing matches and other events are also considered entertainment, so enemy aliens are prohibited from participating.

Several Types of Venues Specified

Other places included in the entertainment venue category are theaters, cinemas, dance halls, nightclubs, bars, the Lyceum Theatre, Jai Alai stadiums, and similar places. American and British associations have already circulated these conditions to American and British citizens. Most enemy aliens from other countries have also received notifications from their citizens' associations or the Swiss Consulate-General. Enemy aliens from other countries who have not received official notification should pay attention to newspaper announcements and abide by these regulations.

Visiting Parks and Night Travel Not Prohibited

Enemy aliens are not prohibited from entering parks, nor are they subject to a curfew. According to qualified sources, although enemy aliens in Shanghai are subject to these restrictions, they still enjoy greater freedom of movement than enemy aliens who are banned in other cities or Japanese nationals in enemy countries.

### Sugar Rationing Ready, No Need to Overstock

The Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office issued a notice stating that the applications for sugar for July from various retailers have been allocated. Purchasing certificates will be issued on the 15th, 16th, and 17th of this month. Retailers are requested to bring their application forms and receipts to the office to exchange for the certificates and pay the sugar shops designated to provide sugar before the 20th of this month.

### Obtain Official Receipts for Baojia Donations in the French Concession

The French Concession authorities announced that the Baojia expenses of the concession were previously raised by the joint Baojia chiefs in each district to solicit donations from wealthy residents. For the purpose of auditing, donors who hold donation receipts issued by the joint Baojia chiefs should exchange them for official receipts at the Baojia Accounting Office in the Central District Police Department at 22 Route Vallon from now on. This notice is issued for general information.

### Light Control Equipment Should Be Seriously Considered

An official from the Air Defense Section of the Shanghai Municipal Police stated that future blackout drills will not be announced in advance to observe the alertness of citizens in sudden situations. All preparations must not be relaxed. Violators of blackout regulations have not actually been severely punished, but there will be changes later. Those who commit particularly serious violations will be expelled from the two concession areas. Those with minor offenses will be temporarily punished by suspension of electricity.

### Subsidies for Poor Students' Meals

Far From the Target, Hope for Enthusiastic Support

The YMCA's initiative to subsidize the meals of poor students has continued to receive donations from various sectors. The subsidy method is to provide meal coupons. Those who pass the review will be issued coupons and preferential cards (with photos). The coupons are divided into one yuan and one yuan and five jiao denominations. The amount each person should receive per semester depends on their needs. The association has surveyed and agreed upon cafeterias. The list of donations is now being published again: Mayling Company, 300 yuan; Lin Chunling, 100 yuan; Li Fuyang, 100 yuan; Mr. Liang Qing'ai, 20 yuan; Mr. Shu Zhaosheng, 200 yuan raised through Xin Feng Printing and Dyeing Factory; Xin Yun Printing and Dyeing Factory, 100 yuan; Jun Chang Factory, 50 yuan; Xin Ji Weaving Factory, 50 yuan; Miss Zhou, 10 yuan; Hong Shihao, 100 yuan; Ni Xiangsheng, 5 yuan; Y. T. Tsoong, 50 yuan; Mr. P Dethlafpen, 20 yuan; W. Korrowitz, 30 yuan; Mr. H. Wieda, 30 yuan. The above totals 1,085 yuan, which, combined with the previous balance of 5,000 yuan, totals 6,085 yuan. The association's fundraising target for meal subsidies is 50,000 yuan. Although donations from various sectors have been somewhat successful, they are still far from the target. It is hoped that enthusiastic people will actively assist in completing this endeavor.

### Fu Dingyi's "Dictionary of Linked Words" to Be Published

Mr. Fu Dingyi of Hengshan, former Director-General of the Salt Affairs Bureau, believes that the special characteristic of the Chinese language lies in compound words, also known as linked words. To explore the origin of words and delve into the intricacies of language, he has collected materials from various books and compiled a "Dictionary of Linked Words."

### Blind School Seeking Winter Clothing

For more than a decade, the Hongqiao Road School for the Blind has been run by Chinese and Westerners, benefiting many blind children in China.

Students with families have been sent home, but there are still 81 homeless students, 46 boys and 35 girls, ranging in age from six to over twenty. According to a letter from Principal Fu of the school, the students need a lot of cotton-padded jackets and trousers this winter. It is hoped that kind people in the city can send their surplus old clothes and trousers to the Chinese Bible Society at 50 Hong Kong Road, the Commercial Press at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Sichuan Road, the Fuyu School at 33 Huangjia Sha Garden, or the School for the Blind at 290 Hongqiao Road. If there is no one to send them, please call 29569, and someone will come to pick them up.

### Uniform A More Solid

Over-the-counter trading of public bonds was sluggish yesterday, with Class A bonds being relatively firm, but only equivalent in price to Class C bonds. The previous difference of 10 yuan or 8 yuan cannot be compared. The market was slightly unloaded by yarn merchants, but there was also buying at low prices. Only Class D bonds broke the 60 yuan level. The market remains committed to its original objectives, and it is unlikely that the future can be abandoned in the near future. Yesterday, Class A reached a high price of 4 yuan, with transactions at 5.2 yuan, which is equivalent to the previous day. Class B reached a high price of 3 yuan, with transactions at 4 yuan, a slight increase of 1 yuan. Class C reached a high price of 4 yuan, with transactions at 5.7 yuan, a slight decrease of 2.1 yuan.

### Edible Oil Distribution Proceeding Smoothly

Beans are still scarce and trading is quiet. The price is expected to increase. 20 bags of Wujiang selected green beans were priced at 206 yuan.

Both imports and sales of red sorghum are weak, and the market is stable. Yesterday, the price of a cart of Mingguang red sorghum was 115.5 yuan.

Soybean cake transactions decreased yesterday, but market sentiment remained good and prices were still high. 450 pieces of Feizi soybean cake were priced at 67 yuan to 67.5 yuan.

Recently, the wholesale distribution of edible oil by the industry association in the city has been quite smooth. Free trading outside has long been eliminated. Currently, there is no other way to obtain oil except through the association's distribution. If a small number of retailers arbitrarily raise prices, anyone can report them and they will be punished. Furthermore, it was found that the total amount distributed last month was 14,397 dan.

### The Cloth Business Is Still Booming

Factory Cloth

Yesterday, due to the high prices of East Asian cloth, market sentiment was strong. The factory's coarse and fine cloth also gradually became active, unlike the previous stagnation. 16-pound Earth coarse cloth was quoted at 193 yuan, Flying Goose 190 yuan with buyers. 9-pound New Character 111 yuan, 8-pound Zhenzhong 108 yuan, 12-pound Earth fine cloth 163.5 yuan, up 1 yuan, Great Peng New order 160 yuan, Bank order 58.5 yuan, Fortune factory order 156.5 yuan, Bank order 152 yuan, Chick Shihlin 245.5 yuan, Peach Blossom Lady Shihlin 252.5 yuan, Meiting Shihlin 243 yuan, all showed strength.

### The Market Trend of Rainproof Cloth Has Changed

Contrary to the previous state of insufficient supply, rainproof cloth is selling exceptionally well. For men, gray and navy blue are the most popular colors, while for women, red, green, and blue are the preferred colors. The selling price is lower than before, mainly because the number of manufacturers has increased sharply. Therefore, the previous situation of demand exceeding supply has suddenly become a situation of supply exceeding demand. Yesterday, Great Ming brand sold for 21 yuan, Golden Bear brand for 22 yuan, Rintai Rente Ape for 19 yuan, Double Deer rainproof cloth sold for 18 yuan, Liangyou for 17 yuan, and Global and Baofeng both sold for 18.5 yuan.

### Business Briefs

Peach Meat Soaring Trend Still Strong

Northern Banks: The price is even higher due to tight integration. Furthermore, as the source of new goods remains scarce, merchants are persistently intent, resulting in the soaring trend remaining strong. Yesterday, several dozen pieces were just released, and the price rose by another two hundred yuan.

Soy Sauce Vegetables Gradually Rise

Preserved Mustard Greens, namely Five-Spice Vegetables, are rapidly rising in price due to the Tianjin exchange relationship. Yesterday, the market, such as the above-mentioned dealer, sold soy sauce vegetables on this street for five hundred yuan. The ordinary goods have also risen accordingly.

Sea Dried Pork Rises Again

Spring and Autumn

### Diligent Study and Vigorous Practice

— Jing

Reading the newspaper every day always brings a unique feeling. I feel that in the history of human evolution, trials and tribulations are inevitable. All movements are about evolution and transformation. Of course, things that cannot survive are eliminated and buried.

Enterprises that benefit the public also occupy a corner of the newspaper. Some people generously donate tens of thousands of yuan in educational grants, and others organize memorial services for philanthropist Guan Jiongzhi. In addition, some people feel that studying is easy but earning a living is difficult, while others feel that studying is difficult but earning a living is not easy. In fact, what is difficult? The difficulty lies in not exerting one's own strength.

The days of one's life are the days of struggle. The progress of the times does not allow for following old habits and enjoying the fruits of others' labor. If anyone still wants to open up a smooth path without hard work and does not overcome difficulties with the spirit of valuing only ability, then merely studying and earning a living is not enough to qualify as a modern citizen.

Study diligently, learn assiduously, and practice vigorously, exert one point of effort, and gain one point of result.

### Silent Elegy

— Zhong Bai

The assistant manager has already announced to everyone that business has been sluggish recently, and therefore, they can no longer maintain it in this way and must dissolve it. He recounted a great deal of unavoidable hardship, saying that nothing could be done. In truth, we were all somewhat moved.

The assistant manager's kindness is worthy of our gratitude. He sent us 120,000 hopes, praying that we could all find suitable positions and saying that he hoped we would all get better positions than we have now. Such enthusiasm and sincerity, who can say that it is not worthy of our gratitude?

The company's dissolution is a matter of course. The reason is very sufficient. The helplessness is true. In the past two months, haven't several shocking and extraordinary things been continuously discovered on the company's profit and loss statements that made the manager shudder? - Pure loss, although this pure loss only reached one percent of the past pure profit.

Helplessness is certainly also a fact. In the past, the three wide office spaces were filled with bustling customers, but now they have become desolate. There is no profit in transactions, so how can they be reconciled? Several telephone machines have gone on total strike, refusing to ring. Silent and soundless, they seem to be mourning the group of us who are about to lose our jobs.

In the past, tears caused by smoke in colleagues' eyes were used as excellent material for mockery. Now, everyone's eyes are somewhat watery. No one mocks, and they sit or stand silently. A shadow of sorrow covers dozens of different faces, and an unspeakable pain surges in everyone's heart.

What basis, what reason is there to reverse this order? Or rather, the company's property self-recording increase can be used as a basis, but there is no such clause in the law. Then, request the manager to save some entertainment expenses! But what reason is there to interfere? There is only silent sorrow.

### The City Besieged Before Double Ninth Festival

— Gao Deng

It is almost the Double Ninth Festival, which quickly reminds me of the line, "The city is besieged before the Double Ninth Festival." However, what follows? Our poet did not explain clearly, only sparsely noting a few words: "Tax collectors arrive, spoiling the fun." It can be seen that our poets compose poetry based on inspiration. Once they encounter reality, they have no choice but to stop writing.

In fact, the appearance of the tax collectors can also be put into poetry. Isn't Gao Deng, like the current secondary landlords, very suitable for depiction? But our poets do not do this. The reason, according to my investigation, is nothing more than the vulgarity of it. Because what poets seek is elegance, bright windows and clean desks, and no worldly worries, not vulgar matters such as firewood, rice, oil, salt, and people's suffering. We pay attention not only to the freshness and elegance of the content but also to the study of the great elegance and non-vulgarity of words. For example, Liu Yuxi's Double Ninth Festival poem was ultimately not written because no one had used the word "cake" before. Once the barrier between elegance and vulgarity is divided, literature and reality become increasingly separated. Therefore, what is passed down to our eyes is mostly the elegant affairs of reclusive scholars admiring the wind and moon or indulging in sensual pleasures. Of course, this is vastly different from today's artistic depravity, but treating literature as a plaything for a small number of elites is always a departure from its original purpose.

Fortunately, we are all ordinary people, forced by firewood, rice, oil, and salt every day. We know that we are not worthy of appending to elegance and living a leisurely life, but being able to talk more about people's suffering and leave behind a shadow of the times will not disgrace the mission given to literature.

Therefore, we should not only draw more on realistic themes but also skillfully refine realistic language in order to embark on the path of popularization.

### Clown and Deputy Clown

— Hai Lin

I saw an article reporting on the art of the clown, but it buried the great art of the clown's brother, the deputy clown, which is something worth supplementing.

If we talk about the family concept of clowns, then the clown is a prodigal son of the clown family. If someone hits me on the left cheek, I will put my right cheek over for a two-stage slap, or if someone spits on my face, I will wait for it to dry - a pathetic art of no ambition. Or, someone kicks me and I fart, setting an example that helps the world and people's hearts. This kind of clown offspring may have already been declared a worthless son in the newspaper by the clown family in order to rectify the clown family's reputation.

But our deputy clown is not like that. His art is indeed enough to glorify the family, a promising offspring.

His performance is not like the clown's wretched appearance. He always plays the role of a yamen runner, a lackey, etc. He has the air of the upper class and can also pick up a pen to draw dragons and tigers. He can play chess and Go for three hundred rounds. He can also kick the Twelve Roads Tan Leg and pose in a Deng Keng stance. He is truly a versatile talent who knows the past and the present, is skilled in both literature and martial arts.

Looking at the plot of the entire play, all the family ruin, wife separation, head injuries, bleeding, snow death, and seeking life, these tragedies are often caused by the deputy clown's art being brought to its highest point and producing masterpieces. These may make the audience gnash their teeth with hatred, but the deputy clown also has a unique skill, which is to turn around and not recognize people. He walks to the edge of the stage, covers his eyes with his long sleeves, squints his eyes, and says, "This is called self-inflicted suffering, what does it have to do with me?" He picks up his wallet and leaves the stage triumphantly.

Relying on the powerful and influential for a time, being respectfully called "Second Master" is the deputy clown's most proud moment. To use the terminology of a fortune teller, it is the time of good luck. Therefore, deception, oppression, and inducement are wholesale during this time. If the patron falls, then he can also slip away and seek good fortune in the border region. Switching to a new person of influence is another "Second Master."

Life is originally a stage. Among these roles of the same color, I cannot help but admire the art of the deputy clown on this stage.

### Tomorrow

— Jie Ren

The most precious thing in the world is time. Other things can always be lost and regained, but once time has passed, no matter how much power or money you have, you cannot restore it. It is truly the most lovable thing in the world. Therefore, successful people desperately hold on to it, not letting go of even a shred of it.

There is a saying that the past is not worth remembering, and the future is unreliable. The most valuable and precious thing is only the present. It is immediately known that tomorrow is unreliable. The word "tomorrow" seems to contain the meaning of absorbing happiness. After tomorrow, there is another tomorrow. After next year, there is another next year. The world does not know how many past tomorrows there have been, and there are also countless future tomorrows following each other as tomorrows.

"Let's talk about it tomorrow" seems to have become a catchphrase. This statement may not seem to have much connection on the surface, but in reality, it is the main reason for wasting time, delaying things, and failing. Many people have wasted countless priceless treasures of time and wealth because they have many tomorrows. But there are also those who work hard today in order to seek happiness tomorrow. This is preparing with today and aiming for tomorrow. Every enterprise must have this determination.

### Remember and Forget Easily

— Mu Guan

In certain situations, we often elevate ourselves particularly high, while at other times, we forget ourselves completely.

The success of a great undertaking is clearly due to the power of the masses, but everyone hopes to exaggerate their contribution beyond others. And if this undertaking fails, everyone will push the responsibility away cleanly, as if they had never participated in it at all.

When listing everyone's advantages, one's own is always the most. However, when discussing shortcomings, one's own is always reduced to zero.

When one suffers, one tells everyone with tears and snots, as if it is a great thing. But when one sees another person suffering, some people will let out a smug sneer.

Cherishing merit, forgetting suffering, the meaning of life is not so simple.

### Gorky's Quotations

— Zuo Qi

Those who do not sow will not reap.

In my youth, I neither drank nor whored. Instead of these two, my favorite thing was reading.

The same work of art will never be exactly the same in the minds of two people.

Every moment of life should have its noble purpose.

People should be seen as a source of creativity, the master of nature (unpaid).

### Sailing in the Same Storm

— He Jia Zhi

One Zero Flying Peak

Cui Zhen has been detained in Wei Yunqing's house for four or five days, and has already heard Wei Cheng clenching his fists and grinding his teeth in indignation. Hearing further that Wei Shaoyun had gathered that group of hooligans and treated Cui Zhen as if she were living an inhuman life, he became even more enraged. Huang Long suddenly picked up a wine glass in one hand and held a salt bean in the other, and walked into the room, saying, "It's no fun drinking plain wine, why don't you tell me about mountains and seas? Don't worry, I'll drink my wine and you tell your tales, I won't interrupt." He sat down by the window, and the magpie readily sent in a bottle of wine, a pair of chopsticks, and a plate of salted chicken. Huang Long said, "What do you need chopsticks for? Take them away, take them away! I have fingers. I don't need chopsticks to eat these things. A person only uses something else when their hands aren't enough." He pulled a shiny knife from his sock and placed it on the table. Second Madam Ye leaned back and said, "Huang Long, don't play with knives and guns and scare me." Cui Zhen looked surprised and said, "Hey, Brother Huang Long, do you have two knives? The one you stuck in the floor was only a hair's breadth away from that murderer's ear. When that knife was shaking on the floor, my heart was shaking in my chest." Huang Long said, "That knife is this knife. If that scoundrel didn't give me his life, why would I give him the knife? I took Sister Cui Zhen on my back and conveniently grabbed the knife back. Didn't you know, haha."

Huang Long laughed heartily, then suddenly cut off his laughter and said, "No, no, I said let you tell me about mountains and seas, but it was me telling you about mountains and seas. No, no." Huang Long took a sip of wine and covered his mouth, not allowing himself to speak. Wei Cheng said, "Fortunately, it was Brother Long, otherwise I really wouldn't know what to do. I heard that Yunqing's parents couldn't control their son, and I didn't know that Sister Cui Zhen had fallen into Wei Shaoyun's hands." Second Madam Ye said, "Wei Cheng, do you feel better now?" Wei Cheng said, "I'm better now that I'm not sick. Now I'm inviting Brother Long to stay at my house, at least until the New Year." Second Madam Ye said, "What about the New Year? There's no need to go anywhere else. I know that Wei Yunqing and his father knew that it was Huang Long who was going (204)."
