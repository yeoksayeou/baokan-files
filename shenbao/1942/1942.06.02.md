### Libyan War Situation: An Imminent Astonishing Development

The war will expand to the entire Mediterranean; Fort Capuzzo is occupied by German forces.

Geneva, May 31st, Havas: "Le Journal" recently published a dispatch from its Berlin correspondent stating, "General Rommel has already mobilized his forces for a decisive battle. As the North African front is too far from other theaters of war, Rommel has been granted special privileges, placing the enemy under heavy fire." "Il Giornale d'Italia" also carried a dispatch from its Rome correspondent stating, "It is widely rumored here that the battle south of Tobruk is a prelude to a major North African war. Italian military circles generally believe that the North African war will expand to the entire Mediterranean, including Malta, Cyprus, and Gibraltar. Astonishing developments are expected in the very near future."

Rome, May 31st, Domei: German-Italian Axis forces have launched another offensive in North Africa. Since the evening of the 26th, German forces, starting from near Fort Capuzzo, have advanced on British positions and quickly occupied Fort Capuzzo, eighty kilometers west of Tobruk. This location is at the intersection of trade routes leading to Tobruk, El Adem, and the New Omar camel route on the Egyptian border. The terrain is flat, which is advantageous for tank movements. The German occupation of this area is strategically significant. British forces counterattacked the Germans in this area and engaged in fierce fighting near El Adem. Currently, Malta is in dire straits due to continuous German bombing.

The British Employ a Bombing Strategy, Regardless of Sacrifice

Vichy, May 31st, Havas: According to reports from Cairo, large-scale battles have been ongoing in the North African front for days, and the intensity of the fighting is constantly increasing. The forces of General Mehl, the commander-in-chief of the German forces in North Africa, are engaged in combat with British forces in several locations. The British Middle East Command announced last night that Axis forces had breached two small gaps in important minefields across the desert, which were immediately reinforced by heavy fire from British field artillery. German motorized units attempted to transport ammunition and food to resupply the forces fighting in the area of Knightsbridge, but the Germans failed to open a sea route. All but a few rapid deployment units of the 19th German Division in North Africa have participated in the major battle. The British Air Force is very active, sparing no effort in bombing enemy motorized units. The British High Command is adopting this bombing strategy, regardless of the cost. Although enemy losses are high, British losses are also significant. However, this new strategy has proven to have the potential to shift the course of the war. The British Air Force authorities announced that on the night of the 29th of last month, military targets in Derna, Benghazi, and Soluch, as well as facilities in the port of Derna, were bombed. On the 30th, the Catania airfield in Sicily was also bombed. Enemy air force activity over Malta has diminished. Many Axis motorcycles in the Helson area have also been destroyed. General Auchinleck, Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in the Middle East, has telegraphed the Eighth Army, encouraging them with "indomitable" spirit. On the German side, a communiqué was also issued regarding the North African war, stating that the weather on the Libyan front had improved last week, and the vanguard of the Axis forces was unusually active. British forces also conducted reconnaissance operations several times. On the 26th of this month, the German-Italian forces launched a large-scale attack on the areas of Helson, Gazala, and El Adem, and a major battle ensued, which is still ongoing. Axis aircraft are also extremely active, continuously bombing enemy lines of communication and baggage trains. Military targets in Tobruk, the Capuzzo railway station, airfields in the Shahat area, as well as barracks, tanks, and truck convoys, have all been hit. The British-held island of Malta in the Mediterranean has been continuously bombed for a week. Although the island's defenses are very comprehensive, they are in vain. British naval and air forces are attacking German-Italian convoys in the Mediterranean. One British torpedo boat was sunk.

### Romania Expresses Determination to Recover Lost Territory

Cabinet Associate Publicly Makes a Speech; Hungarian-Romanian Relations are Now Increasingly Tense

Bucharest, May 31st, Havas: University students here took the opportunity of their graduation to hold a large-scale demonstration in Sibiu. Representatives from student circles in various places went to participate. Foreign Minister and Cabinet Associate Mihai Antonescu, accompanied by Aviation Minister Cănăscu and Propaganda Minister Măru, also went to inspect. The students cheered and saluted them, and chanted the slogan "Recover Outer Transylvania."

Bucharest, May 31st, Havas: Romanian Cabinet Associate Mihai Antonescu recently gave a speech at the University of Cluj in Sibiu (University of Cluj moved to Sibiu after Outer Transylvania was ceded to Hungary), reiterating the Romanian people's demand to recover Outer Transylvania. He said, "Outer Transylvania to our country is not merely a province or a part of our territory, but the deposit of our national spirit and history. That province is to our country as the Rhine is to Germany. It will forever be a part of our Carpathian highlands. Our treatment of Outer Transylvania is like a loving mother's love for her child. Our demand today is not merely empty words or reliance on pen and ink, but we have soldiers as our backing, and we are prepared to seek it with hot blood. Whether we can survive depends on whether we can guarantee this right, and I do not wish to say more."

Bucharest, May 31st, Havas: Regarding the issue of the Outer Transylvania region, Cabinet Associate and Foreign Minister Antonescu again touched on Romania's demand to recover Outer Transylvania in a speech at the University of Cluj today. This is the second time that the Romanian authorities have publicly made this demand. In addition, this issue has become increasingly tense due to the Romanian government's dissatisfaction with the Hungarian authorities' mistreatment of Romanian people in the area. Recent events have forced the Romanian government to clarify its position, so all parties are urging the government to take a tough stance on this matter. The real purpose of the Foreign Minister's speech is also here, not to make an untimely demand at this time. In fact, the Romanian government fully understands that it is too early to talk about revising the treaty signed between Romania and Hungary at this time. Therefore, Romania's views are completely in line with the German Foreign Ministry, namely, all territorial issues in Eastern and Western Europe must be resolved after the end of the war.

### 2. An Overview of Turkey (4)

The Budding of New Life

In the early summer of 1919, a group of about forty or fifty people traveled by boat from Constantinople to Asia Minor. They were Kemal and his trusted comrades. Their journey was undertaken with the grand plan of restoring the Central Plains and working hard towards it. As soon as this group arrived in Asia Minor, they heard that the Greek army had occupied Smyrna on Turkey's western border, which further increased the group's grief and indignation. Upon arriving at the border town where Kemal was stationed, without even settling down, they immediately set about two major tasks: training troops and forming a party. This branch of troops would be the basic army for eliminating enemy forces and avenging their shame in the future, and this party would be the Kuomintang for revitalizing the country and strengthening the race in the future. The combination of these two was the embryo of the new Turkish life.

After working hard in this desolate border town for about a year, in 1920, this fledgling Kuomintang overthrew the corrupt cabinet with one blow. Talented people from the Kuomintang accounted for the majority of the newly formed cabinet and parliament, and they immediately passed the "National Pact" drafted by Kemal. The most important clause in this pact was to seek Turkey's complete independence and freedom, and to oppose all foreign interference. At this time, Kemal and the military and political groups he had painstakingly managed had moved from the border town to Ankara, the central area of Asia Minor and now the capital of Turkey. In April of the same year, the "National Assembly Government" was established here by convening parliamentarians. This move was not because Kemal had any ambition to form a government, but because of the strong foreign forces that wanted to use the government in Constantinople to destroy the new life of Turkey, so Kemal used this decisive means to deal with it. By 1921, the situation was deteriorating day by day, and foreign forces were pressing in day by day, so Kemal roared and officially notified at home and abroad that he denied any treaty signed by the Sultan under the threat of the Allied forces, and declared that the National Government of Ankara was the only government of Turkey! Originally, the Sultan in Constantinople was already only living on a thread and was on the verge of death.

The part of Turkish history that is especially inspiring is the story of the Turkish-Greek war, in which the Turkish army swept away the Greek army that had occupied Smyrna and wanted to invade Asia Minor beyond the borders. In the summer of 1922, hundreds of thousands of Greek troops, after hundreds of miles of fighting, wreaked havoc in various parts of Turkey. The Turkish army retreated steadily, pushing the Turkish army to the city of Ankara, the origin of the revolution, only forty miles from the city. However, the morale of the Turkish army remained undiminished, and Kemal personally commanded it, looking forward to a general counter-offensive.

Sure enough, in less than two or three months, Turkey won a diplomatic victory and gained international trust. Kemal then encouraged his soldiers and issued an order for a general counter-offensive. In just one week, the Greek front lines wavered and eventually collapsed. At this time, the Turkish army took advantage of the situation to pursue the fleeing enemy and drive the Greek army to the corner of Smyrna where they had originally landed. Finally, the Turkish army, following Kemal's brilliant plan to cut off the Greek army's retreat, captured countless more enemies. The Greek army was at a loss and had no choice but to gather its defeated troops and flee in a panic from Turkey's borders. A vast and beautiful land was once again shining under the waving of the Turkish flag. St. Sophia's Grand Mosque in Constantinople

### Kharkov Front: Soviet Forces Adopt a Defensive Posture

Corpses Littered and Destroyed Vehicles Everywhere; Evidence of the Fierce Battle

Moscow, May 31st, Domei: The Soviet military authorities issued the following war report at noon on the 31st: In the areas of Izyum and Barvenkovo, Soviet troops engaged in fierce defensive battles with enemy tanks and infantry units on the 30th. There were no major changes in other areas.

Moscow, May 31st, Havas:

The Red Army newspaper "Red Star" recently reported, "The Red Army on the Kharkov front has completely abandoned its offensive strategy and is now consolidating its positions. The German army has repeatedly attacked, attempting to find weaknesses in our side. Fierce fighting is currently underway. Enemy attacks have been repeatedly repelled by our army. Soviet tank units have forced German motorized units to retreat to their original positions, but German infantry has invaded our positions. Several German tanks have been destroyed by our army."

Geneva, May 31st, Havas: A war correspondent for the "Swiss Daily" who visited the Kharkov front recently sent a telegram reporting on the front-line situation, stating, "A decisive battle is currently taking place in the Kharkov area. The Red Army has suffered heavy casualties, with corpses littering the fields. The small road south of Alekseyevka is now controlled by the German army. The riverbank is covered with the wreckage of tanks, indicating that fierce fighting took place there in the past few days. I also saw a large number of Red Army prisoners of war in the area, who were being held in concentration camps by Hungarian troops. The Red Army soldiers were neatly dressed and their shoes were completely different from previous years. Although they were still young, their faces were expressionless, obviously due to the major trauma they suffered in this fierce battle. When we reached the Red Army's resistance line, we saw that the villages and towns in front were completely destroyed by artillery fire, and ordinary people were busy building temporary houses. Later, we arrived at the town of Belgorod, the center of the Kharkov area, where the Red Army's 5th Division was trapped. The wreckage of tanks was everywhere. The destroyed anti-aircraft guns were still aimed at the sky. After inspecting this battlefield for a week, I was filled with many emotions that cannot be described in words. A large number of Red Army soldiers were killed by machine gun fire, and their remains were scattered everywhere, which was unbearable to witness. The German army has organized special teams to carry out burial work. In addition, I also saw the Red Army abandoning a large number of intact automobiles and trucks."

Convoy Bombed in the Arctic Ocean

Berlin, June 1st, Reuter: According to military sources, German aircraft continued to bomb enemy convoys north of Murmansk the day before yesterday, heavily damaging three merchant ships, totaling 30,000 tons.

Berlin, May 31st, Havas: A German Air Force war correspondent recently published an article describing the German Air Force's bombing of enemy convoys in the Arctic Ocean. The article stated, "In the airspace near the 'ice floes' in the Arctic Ocean, we spotted a large enemy escort fleet heading east from the west, carrying a large amount of aid to the Soviet Union. The first two ships were brown, and the rest followed behind, zigzagging to avoid our aircraft's bombing. However, our dive bombers discovered the enemy ships and dived down, dropping a large bomb that hit the deck of an enemy ship. Then, the second bomb was also successful. Looking down, the ship had already broken in two. After our plane ascended, the damage was still faintly visible. In addition, several other ships were set on fire by the bombing. It is estimated that our bomber squadron sank four enemy ships in a few hours, totaling about 25,000 tons. Three other ships were on fire, and many others were hit by bombs."

No Battles in the Kalinin Area

### Reenactment of the Battle of Verdun on the Kharkov Front (Part 1)

Long ago, people were talking about the "Spring Offensive," but as spring quietly slipped away, the stage remained largely silent, save for the occasional faint drumbeat. Had they forgotten? No, they were far from weary. After a long winter's rest, they appeared more invigorated than ever.

The great wheel of time turned into May, the season of early summer. The weather was neither too cold nor too hot, truly a fine season! Then one day, our protagonist's hands and feet began to itch. "A still mind seeks movement," they thought. Now was the time to take the stage. At their command, the drums at the front of the stage immediately quickened, beat out another rhythm, then the lights dimmed, the curtain rose, and the splendid drama, Kharkov: The Soviet industrial center, the city map showing the concentration of trust companies, finally commenced.

A Grand Spectacle

The audience, suddenly stimulated, straightened their necks, held their breath, and even those who had dozed off opened their eyes wide. They pondered what secrets this long-awaited drama held. Our protagonist did not disappoint the audience. They started with great energy, presenting a grand spectacle rarely seen in years. The long-rumored secret weapon was also brought out. The black, wriggling creatures were as numerous as ants on the ground, and the dragonflies in the sky darkened half the sky. Our protagonist spared no effort in their performance, giving their all to ensure that the audience, having waited so long, would be especially pleased, applauding and praising them endlessly.

Far back in the summer of last year, the German army had achieved some success on the borders of Ukraine. Germany intended to strike south in one fell swoop, thereby defeating the opposing force. If they could occupy the Caucasus and, in addition, the abundant treasures of this granary of Europe, then even if the enemy continued to clamor for long-term resistance, they would at least have a strategic advantage and inexhaustible resources, and would not have to constantly worry about economic plans. Alas, heaven would not help. Just when their performance was at its most exciting, winter quietly descended upon the land. The north wind howled, the ground froze, and everything was covered with thick snow. Helplessly, they had to relinquish the gains they had in hand. Originally, the northern part of Ukraine, the Kharkov region in particular, should have been much warmer in latitude. However, as soon as the shadow of autumn passed, it was nothing but wind and snow all day long. Staying indoors, one's hands and feet would freeze, and any fighting would inevitably be timid. Fortunately, these two heroes were both seasoned veterans, so even in those harsh days, they would occasionally come out to test their strength. However, this was just a minor diversion, a practice session. The best and most exciting parts were naturally reserved for later.

Verdun Reenacted

At the beginning of May this year, the Germans launched a swift attack on Kouk Island. Although the Soviet Union had long been prepared and anticipated such a move, they also launched a general offensive in Kharkov. The fighting in the Kharkov region has now been going on for two weeks, with both sides locked in a fierce struggle.

Why is Kharkov so important? Some have compared this great battle to the Battle of Verdun in the previous war, with both sides placing immense importance on it. While we cannot say that the outcome of this battle will affect the entire war, it is undeniable that it at least has some decisive factors. The Kharkov region refers to the area surrounding the city of Kharkov, including the surrounding towns and villages. The total area is approximately 55,000 square kilometers. It is located on the northeastern border of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, bordering Russia. From there, it extends south to the Sea of Azov, a necessary passage to the Outer Caucasus. The terrain in this area is generally flat, except for the irregular hills in the west, making it ideal for mechanized units. The Dnieper and Donets rivers flow through it, forming the famous Don region. The crisscrossing waterways facilitate irrigation, making it the most fertile agricultural area.

Because the soil in this area is black, some call it the black soil belt, and others have given it the elegant name of granary of Europe. These names are all to show the special wealth of this region. The soil in this area is fertile enough, and not only do the Russians value it, but it is also one of the most prosperous areas in Eastern Europe. In recent years, the Soviet Union has used new scientific methods to improve the land, such as organizing farms and establishing experimental stations. After the Third Five-Year Plan, production figures have increased several times compared to the past. The main agricultural product is wheat, followed by oats, barley, and rye. Tobacco and sugar cane also have considerable annual yields.

Quiet Don

Speaking of the Don River, the name may not be unfamiliar to the Chinese, and it may even evoke a special feeling. Anyone who has read Mikhail Sholokhov's "Quiet Flows the Don" will probably feel a sense of longing. The author depicts the lives of the farmers in this area, with a strong local flavor. In the era of Imperial Russia, this was the gathering place of the famous Cossacks. Mentioning the word Cossack, people will naturally think of words like brave and valiant. This is a figure somewhat similar to the knights of medieval Western Europe, both healthy and generous. In the past, they may have committed some tyrannical acts due to their special status, but in general, they were a group of resolute and kind-hearted people. Their heroic deeds have written many inspiring, great, and immortal poems. In the eyes of the Russians, a Cossack has something of the extraordinary about them. Now that Imperial Russia has been overthrown, the word Cossack has become a historical memory, but the later generations who grew up along the Don River and in the Kharkov region still retain the unique bravery and integrity of their ancestors in their blood. They can endure hardship and remain calm in the face of adversity. Profound and self-confident are their inherent qualities. They are not afraid of the arrival of disaster. On the contrary, they accept challenges with a heroic spirit of fearlessness. This time, they have fully demonstrated the advantages of their traditional nation. Even a German soldier will be surprised by their tenacious and indomitable spirit.

Going east from Kharkov, the population density is lower, making it a good area for animal husbandry. On the vast grasslands, herds of cattle and sheep roam freely. At sunset, the copper bells tied to the sheep's heads jingle in the evening wind, adding a layer of dazzling charm to the vast wilderness. The shepherds here are a group of extremely talented and intelligent children. They spend their days braving the wind and rain, riding along the Don River. They work diligently. Perhaps in the lazy and drowsy summer, or in the cold and snowy weather, in the harsh days, they watch the water of the Don River flowing murmuringly, stretching far away. Their small minds are also filled with boundless reverie. When the long winter steps into this land, and a thick layer of ice accumulates on the water of the Don River, their thoughts are also imprisoned like the river water. As the days go by, relying on their young, clear, and lively memories, they will write many precious and beautiful poems. There are also many who have become excellent painters. Turning to the list of names of modern Russian artists, we can easily find many who grew up on the banks of the Don River.

### Shanghai Banking Association Decides on Currency Conversion Procedures

Suspension of Spot Exchange of Old Legal Tender, Suspension of Acceptance and Exchange of Damaged Banknotes Effective Immediately

Following the Shanghai Silver Line Joint Committee's announcement that all debts and liabilities will be based on the Central Reserve Bank note effective yesterday, the committee convened a joint meeting of the Silver Line Industry Association at 2:00 PM yesterday. After the chairman reported on the implementation process, the meeting immediately discussed various internal procedures for grain merchants and decided on several proposals. The meeting adjourned around 4:00 PM.

Conversion Method for Existing Old Currency

The Bank Union Reserve Association has stipulated the following methods for converting existing old currency balances of banks and merchants into Central Reserve Bank notes, effective June 1st: For old legal tender cash deposits of each bank and merchant in the association, a transfer application or check shall be issued based on the remaining balance of the association, and the amount of the Central Reserve Bank note shall be converted at a rate of two to one and transferred to the original Central Reserve Bank note account of each bank and merchant. For old legal tender clearing deposits of each bank and merchant in the association, a transfer application or check shall be issued based on the remaining balance of the association, and the Central Reserve Bank note clearing shall be converted at a rate of two to one, and a separate Central Reserve Bank note clearing account shall be opened for receipt and payment. The original old legal tender cash account or old legal tender clearing account of each bank and merchant in the association shall be closed after the transfer calculation according to the previous two articles. From June 1st to June 6th, if each bank and merchant needs to withdraw old legal tender cash deposited with the association, the amount withdrawn shall be collected from the association at a rate of two to one. The difference between the mutual accounts between each bank and merchant and the association before June 1st shall be corrected by transfer method after verification. If each bank and merchant dismantles old legal tender clearing funds from the association, the amount of Central Reserve Bank note clearing shall be converted by the association at a rate of two to one.

Suspension of Old Currency Instrument Exchange

The Bank Union Reserve Association notified its members yesterday that it will suspend the exchange of old legal tender cash and clearing instruments from June 1st. From the same date, it will increase the exchange of Central Reserve Bank note clearing instruments. The methods are as follows: The exchange of old legal tender cash and old legal tender clearing instruments of the association will be suspended from June 1st. The association will increase the exchange of Central Reserve Bank note clearing instruments from June 1st. From June 1st, the exchange bank entrusts the agent exchange bank and other business banks and merchants to receive the old legal tender cash and old legal tender clearing instruments developed before May 21, and shall convert each one into the amount of the Central Reserve Bank note at a rate of two to one, and indicate the converted amount in red numerals on the front of the instrument, and submit it for exchange or entrust collection separately. For foreign bank instruments deposited into the association on May 30 and collected on the next day, the association shall receive Central Reserve Bank notes or Central Reserve Bank note clearing at a rate of two to one. All deposit counterfoils of the association's deposit counterfoils of the above-mentioned foreign bank instruments shall be corrected immediately. When the amount of old legal tender is converted into Central Reserve Bank notes, the one-cent place of the amount of old legal tender shall be rounded up to an even number and then divided by two to avoid discrepancies.

Suspension of Acceptance and Exchange of Damaged Banknotes

The Bank Union Reserve Association notified each bank and merchant yesterday, saying that the Shanghai Silver Line Industry Association Member Temporary United Committee instructed, "The Bank Industry Union Reserve Committee's acceptance and exchange of damaged old legal tender deposited by various industries should be stopped from June 1, 31 years of the Republic of China," and so on. It should be followed accordingly. It is appropriate to send a letter to inform you and ask you to check. According to the Social News Agency, it is learned that the banking industry in this city, in view of the large number of banknotes of the Chinese Farmers' Bank circulating in this city, will inevitably suffer considerable losses to the citizens once it is unable to exchange for new legal tender. Therefore, they will request accommodation to show compassion.

Acting Collection and Exchange

Four Measures

According to the Allied News Agency, after the Central Reserve Bank announced the measures for recovering old legal tender, it has now commissioned the member banks of the Shanghai Banking Association to act as agents for collecting and exchanging old legal tender. It is said that the collection and exchange will begin on June 8. The following are the measures for the collection and exchange of old legal tender by each bank: 1. Each bank shall deposit old legal tender: (A) Fill in the "Report Form of Inventory of New and Old Legal Tender" with the amount of old legal tender in inventory as of June 7, 31 years of the Republic of China, and submit it together with the "Exchange Certificate for Inventory of Old Legal Tender by Silver Line Industries" to the Reserve Bank on June 8. (B) (For the various old legal tenders stipulated in the regulations of the above-mentioned regulations for the sorting of old legal tenders, the Central Reserve Bank will be given a temporary acceptance on June 9.) Each bank shall issue a certificate for the above-mentioned delivered old legal tender. If the bank feels it is difficult to collect it for a while, it may temporarily deposit it in each bank, and each bank shall issue a deposit certificate. (C) The Central Reserve Bank's exchange method for the above-mentioned old legal tender: half of the total amount will be converted into Central Reserve Bank notes at a rate of two yuan of old legal tender to one yuan of Central Reserve Bank notes and delivered to the 31-year Financial Stability Public Bond of the Republic of China (temporarily replaced by receipts). The remaining amount will be converted into Central Reserve Bank notes at a rate of two yuan of old legal tender to one yuan of Central Reserve Bank notes as the current deposit of each bank, and may listen to the wishes of each bank to convert part or all of it into clearing deposits, or three-month time deposits. The clearing deposits or time deposits will be given an annual interest of three percent. Clearing deposits are allowed to be converted into cash deposits within three months. 2. Old legal tender entrusted to the agent for collection and exchange: (A) Entrusted agent collection and exchange is limited to small-amount exchanges with old currency amounts less than 10,000 yuan. The exchange method is as follows: For small-amount exchanges of less than 10,000 yuan, each bank shall check that the type of old currency submitted is in accordance with the regulations for the sorting of old legal tender, and then pay it with Central Reserve Bank notes at a rate of two yuan of old currency to one yuan of Central Reserve Bank notes. For the above-mentioned old currency received, each bank shall submit it to the Central Reserve Bank together with the "Exchange Certificate for Old Legal Tender by Silver Line Industries" by noon on the same day or the next day. The Central Reserve Bank will pay the Central Reserve Bank with reserve notes at a rate of two yuan of old currency to one yuan of Central Reserve Bank notes for the above-mentioned old legal tender submitted, or it will be used as the current deposit of each bank. 3. Handling fee: The Central Reserve Bank will pay a handling fee of 0.5% for the agent exchange of old legal tender. 4. Prepayment of funds: A. After the Central Reserve Bank and each agent exchange bank agree, if necessary, funds for agent exchange may be prepaid to each bank. B. When each bank collects prepaid funds, it will be used as a deposit in each bank, and the amount paid due to the exchange of old currency every day will be deducted from the deposit. The amount paid will be reported by the agent collection and exchange bank at any time.

### Payment Method for Rice with Old Legal Tender

The Shanghai Municipal Council issued a notice yesterday stating that it specifically stipulates that when citizens pay for rice to rice shops, and rice shops pay to the Council with old legal tender, they are only allowed to pay with convertible banknotes. This is a special announcement for public knowledge.

In the two concessions, when rice shops receive rice from the Council these past few days, the police have been strictly enforcing queuing and numbering. On the previous day, when rice was being released, several people were arrested for forcibly squeezing into the queuing lines. Therefore, the public should strictly abide by the queuing order and be careful not to rush and jostle, lest they be punished.

### "Wan Sheng" Ship to Resume Sailing Soon

Operating on the Shanghai-Ningbo Line

After the "Hai Fu" ship was transferred and renamed "Wan Sheng," the shipowner, Xu Guisheng, and others actively proceeded with the sailing formalities. Everything is now gradually in order, but the navigation permit has not yet been obtained. It is heard that the Japanese naval authorities will issue it within a few days. The ship has been entrusted to China Shipping Company for management and will participate in the Shanghai-Ningbo line. The "Hua Lin" ship will be transferred to the Zhoushan Shenjiamen line, implementing alternate schedules. The "Wan Sheng" ship will sail to Ningbo on the 5th. After the "Hua Lin" ship returns to Shanghai on the 4th, it will be temporarily suspended for repairs and will sail to Zhoushan Shenjiamen on a scheduled basis. Gu Chunyi has been appointed by the company as the purser of the "Wan Sheng" ship. Mr. Gu has arrived on the ship to work. In addition to Mr. Gu employing staff for the accounting and cabin departments, the remaining crew members, such as sailors and stewards, will be transferred from the original lower-level crew members of the "Hong Hua" ship, which is currently suspended.

### Ningbo Association Held Memorial for Ancestors Yesterday

The Ningbo Association, in order to commemorate the ancestors and to encourage the spirit of mutual assistance among fellow villagers for common welfare, held a memorial service for ancestors at 2:00 PM yesterday on the fourth floor. The presidium consisted of Yuan Ludeng, Zhang Huizhi, Zhang Jiguang, Sun Meitang, and Fang Jiaobo. About hundreds of fellow villagers attended. First, Yuan Ludeng reported the achievements of the ancestors Shi Mei, Chen Rongguan, and Le Zhenbao. He especially praised Shi's enthusiasm for using his entire estate to help the Association, Chen's dedication and self-sacrificing spirit, and Le's sacrifice of personal gain to expand the Association by purchasing inexpensive land in 1920 to build the Association's premises. Fang Jiaobo then spoke about the life and deeds of the ancestors, praising their spirit.

### Maintaining Animal Health

After the tiger in Gujiazhai Park died of illness, an autopsy was performed, and it was diagnosed that the death was caused by gastrointestinal parasites. The tiger has been skinned and will be displayed as a specimen in the Aurora Museum as a memorial. The park authorities, in order to prevent similar incidents from happening to the other lions and bears in the park, will have a veterinarian examine them monthly and provide them with appropriate nutrition to avoid repeating the tragedy of the tiger's death.

Social Services

School for the Deaf Recruits Free Students

The Shanghai Zhongshan School for the Deaf has been recruiting impoverished deaf students for its free classes. The school has now extended the deadline. Those who wish to apply can register immediately at No. 6, 2nd Floor, Lao Jiuzhang Building, No. 422 Nanjing Road. Books and supplies are provided by the school, and tuition and miscellaneous fees are waived.

### The Market in Financial Upheaval

— Pei

"Overnight Change," the legal tender has finally been limited for exchange.

Yesterday, the Shanghai market seemed like the churning waters of the Huangpu River, with huge waves and small ripples, constantly changing and reflecting many dynamics.

On Saturday afternoon, around three or four o'clock, the banks posted notices at their entrances about exchanging old legal tender for Central Reserve Bank notes. Because it was the weekend, few pedestrians on the street noticed, and there seemed to be little reaction at the time. However, those who saw the notices or learned of the news quietly made their own plans.

That evening and night, some shops, especially those selling daily necessities, suddenly had many more customers than usual. Of course, a lot of cash also came in; however, non-Central Reserve Bank notes suddenly became a concentrated presence.

That night passed... June 1st arrived yesterday, and various news items were circulating in the market. In the morning, large and small shops were looking around, and everyone had a sense of "wait-and-see." A kind of atmosphere that was not very clear or obvious, but had some elements of inquiry, expectation, and experimentation, was swirling in the market. Several large department stores on Nanjing Road, such as Daxin, Xinxin, Wing On, the National Goods Company, and several jewelry stores, large shops, etc., had not opened for business around 9:30 or 10:00 AM.

How would the banks handle it? Everyone stretched their necks and inquired from everyone they met. Good, the banks opened! They received bank drafts as usual, but suspended the acceptance of cash. They paid out notes after applying the exchange rate and did not make any more changes. When receiving bank drafts, the banks stamped a "By order, starting June 1, 1942, exchange at a rate of 2:1 for Central Reserve Bank notes" stamp on the remittance slip. At the same time, they converted the deposited amount into Central Reserve Bank notes. For example, if the deposited amount was 3,000 yuan, the clerk would write a note saying, "Equivalent to CRB 1,500 yuan."

Yesterday, the general prices of goods not only did not fall, but some things even lacked standard prices. Amidst the market chaos, it was inevitable that some people would take the opportunity to raise prices to seek a good price. Large-scale trades and huge transactions all came to a halt. The interiors of large and small offices were filled with an outwardly calm atmosphere, like a flattened sugar-coated quinine tablet. The most timely speculative trades, the silver firms and yarn firms dealing in factory order notes and military scrip, were even busier than on weekends.

Originally, speculative friends who bought and sold at the same time seemed to have less enthusiasm yesterday. After the opening prices were posted (factory order notes were 5,000 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes yesterday morning), in the past, you would sell and I would buy, shouting loudly, with the appearance of ten thousand "horses" galloping and earth-shattering shouts. Yesterday, until the closing at 11:30 AM, everyone seemed very civilized, and the bosses also showed some listless expressions. The margin amounts on the blackboard were all changed to Central Reserve Bank notes. Some were 400 on the same day and 800 overnight, while others were 500 on the same day, and the minimum was only 300, and 1,000 overnight, with considerable differences.

Legal tender... old legal tender... Central Reserve Bank notes... new legal tender... CRB... Before the prices of various retail goods, there were different ways of writing the currency standards. The shop assistants worked hard all night or half a day in the morning, and what they showed to the millions of customers in Shanghai were those long, short, square, round, Chinese-Western, and colorful strips and labels.

The French Concession tram yesterday posted a notice in the cars that one-cent and five-cent subsidiary notes would be refused. Under the extremely high cost of living, these weak one-cent and five-cent notes said their final "goodbye" to the public from now on.

### Punishment for Collecting Bribes for Transferring Houses

Chen Yufang Sentenced to Fifteen Days of Imprisonment

The Chinese Chen Yufang recently transferred a residence at No. 10, Lane 560, Kangnai Road, and collected a bribe of 5,500 yuan. This was in violation of Article 55 of the Municipal Council's regulations prohibiting the collection of bribes. The Municipal Council's Legal Department learned of this and sent personnel to the address, pretending to negotiate the transfer of the house, and took the opportunity to arrest Chen. This morning (the 1st), he was sent to court and sentenced to fifteen days of imprisonment. Chen is the first person to be punished for violating the regulations prohibiting the collection of bribes. Another person, Wang Qingyi (transliteration), and two others transferred a residence at No. 13, Lane 610, Xiaoshadu Road, and collected a bribe of 4,500 yuan. They were also interrogated this morning. Because the case still needs to be investigated, the defendant was temporarily sent back for continued hearing on Wednesday.

### Military Scrip Transactions by Money Shops

Require Permission

According to the Allied News Agency, the Japanese military authorities have decided that military scrip transactions by money shops must be pre-approved by the Japanese authorities. A joint announcement was made yesterday at noon by the Japanese Shanghai Army Press Department and the Chinese Fleet Press Department as follows: "From now on, money shops in the Shanghai area that engage in Japanese military scrip transactions must have permission from the Supreme Commander of the Japanese Army and Navy in the Shanghai area. This permission matter has been entrusted to the Shanghai-based overseas resident finance officer."

Military Scrip Transactions

Permission Procedures

According to the Allied News Agency, the Japanese Shanghai Army and Navy authorities have already announced that military scrip transactions by money shops must be permitted. The permission matter has been entrusted to the Shanghai-based resident finance officer. The permission procedures are listed below. After military scrip transactions by money shops must be permitted, money shops that have not been permitted by the Supreme Commander of the Japanese Army and Navy cannot engage in military scrip exchange business. In other words, it is the adoption of a military-approved military scrip transaction money shop system. The Japanese military authorities generally allow money shops currently engaged in the military scrip business to continue to engage in military scrip transactions. However, if there is any behavior that violates the regular policy in the future, the permission for military scrip transactions may be revoked. Although the permission matter is entrusted to the finance officer, the amount of military scrip transactions of more than 1,000 yuan must be permitted by the finance officer. The authorities will notify the Shanghai Money Industry Association, the Shanghai Money Exchange Association, and the Shanghai Silver Mouth Industry Association of the criteria for normal military scrip transactions. Then, the three associations will be responsible for the actual operation. (The Shanghai Tobacco Exchange Association does not apply to the above regulations.)

### Repatriation Ship Painted with Markings

The English-language "Da Mei Evening News" reports that there is no new information available regarding the repatriation of American, British, and Canadian expatriates from Shanghai. However, the Italian ship "Conte Verde," one of the ships to be used for repatriation, was freshly painted gray this morning (the 1st) in preparation for departure. Red crosses are painted on the bow, stern, and near the funnels. A giant Japanese flag is painted on the side of the ship, proving that the ship is prepared to carry American and British expatriates and sail immediately to Lourenço Marques, a Portuguese territory in Africa.

### Special Ship for Repatriating Cantonese

Direct to Guangzhou

The second batch of free repatriation of fellow villagers to their hometowns by the Cantonese Repatriation Committee was originally scheduled to be implemented in mid-last month. However, it was repeatedly postponed due to a lack of ships. Now, the committee has negotiated a special ship that will go directly to Guangzhou during the day. Ship tickets will be distributed at 2:00 PM today. It is heard that the committee will repatriate a total of 252 people this time, including more than 60 sailors. According to the committee, the repatriation of fellow villagers returning to Shantou will also be held soon.

### One Man Marries Three Women

Original Wife Dissolves Engagement

Wang Mingyang (18 years old, from Ningbo), a student at Guangxia Middle School, lives at No. 65, Lane 74, Sacred Heart Hospital Road, French Concession. Years ago, he fell in love with Chen Xiuzhen, a woman from Haimen, and swore an oath of marriage. Recently, Wang also had a relationship with his classmate Jiang Yingu. Both women became pregnant one after another and urged him to set a wedding date. Wang consulted his father, Wang Xianggui, who, out of love for his son, hastily arranged for his son to marry Jiang in the spring of this year at Sanhe Lou. A few days later, he held a wedding for his son and Chen at Lido Garden, staging a farce of bigamy. Later, due to the secrecy of the affair, it was exposed, causing a sensation in society. The police also prosecuted Wang for bigamy and his father for suspected aiding and abetting. It is now learned that the case has taken another turn. It turns out that Wang Mingyang was engaged to Qian Juying, a woman from his hometown, years ago. After learning of the situation, Qian's father negotiated with Wang. Now, after the mediation of relatives and friends, both parties have dissolved the engagement. This is also a scene in a deformed family.

### House Transfer Licenses

Only Processed by the Shanghai Municipal Council

Since the Shanghai Municipal Council's Housing Transfer License Management Office closed its various licensing branches, from yesterday onwards, licenses are only processed by the Donations and Taxes Office at No. 506, Lower Level, Jiangxi Road Building, Shanghai Municipal Council. The license fee is still 元, the magnetic card fee is 1 yuan, and the late fee is 10 yuan, for a total of 20 yuan. Only a little over ten licenses were issued yesterday. The investigation in various districts is still being conducted separately.

### Public Concession Public Organizations

To be Reregistered Soon

Regarding the registration of public organizations in the Public Concession with the Special High Police Department, as reported by the "Brazili" previously, according to the reporter of Datong News Agency, the application forms for the public organization registration certificate are still being printed. Once printed, the various organizations will be notified immediately to start the application registration procedures.

### Pawnshops and Pawnshops

Shorten Period and Increase Interest Rates Starting Yesterday

Pawnshops in the city have shortened the pawn period to eight months starting yesterday, and the monthly interest rate has increased to five cents per yuan. Pawnshops have also shortened the pawn period to four months starting yesterday, with a monthly interest rate of five cents, plus a warehouse rent of one cent, for a total of six cents.

### 17th Route Army Vehicle

Kills Elementary School Student

At the intersection of Jin Shenfu Road and Jiaxiyi Road in the French Concession, at around 4:00 PM yesterday, an elementary school student from Xingzhong Elementary School, about ten years old, was returning home from school. While walking along Jin Shenfu Road, an electric trolleybus of the 17th Route Army suddenly sped by, unable to brake in time, and knocked him down and crushed him to death. The scene was very tragic.

### Diamond Ring Worth 50,000 Yuan

Pawnshop Owner Arrested for Accepting Stolen Goods

Hong'an Pawnshop on Avenue Joffre accepted a diamond ring worth 50,000 yuan, which was stolen by a Russian thief, and silverware and jewelry on September 26 of last year. Later, it was resold to others for a huge profit. Later, the French Concession police cracked the case of the Russian thief Fei Liangkaofu, who confessed the previous situation. The French Concession police notified the French police and arrested Zhao Shande, a partner of Hong'an Pawnshop. According to his confession, the stolen goods were brought by a Western woman for sale, with a signed receipt from the woman as proof. Zhao was detained, and the investigation continued yesterday. The police brought up the Russian thief Fei Erkaofu, who confessed that he had stolen the jewelry from an apartment in Weihaiwei and pawned it at Hong'an Pawnshop. He signed the receipt himself, not a Western woman. When questioned, Zhao had no response. The police chief considered that Zhao Shande, a partner of Hong'an Pawnshop, had accepted stolen goods and concealed the facts, which was abhorrent. He was ordered to be detained for further questioning.

### Fatal Punch Mistakenly Identifying a Thief

Victim's Spleen Ruptured

Cai Yongqing (27 years old, from Tongzhou), a machine worker, has recently been a sub-landlord at No. 10, Wan'anfang, Xin Tangjia Lane. He has a violent temper, and objects have often been stolen recently without any witnesses. He harbors resentment. At around 6:00 PM on the 21st of last month, a certain Jia, about thirty years old and poorly dressed, walked in through the front door, seemingly looking for relatives or friends. After a while, he suddenly came out from the back door and met Cai. When asked what he was doing, he was evasive. Cai was furious and suspected that this person was a thief. He slapped him twice and punched him hard in the chest, causing him to fall to the ground unconscious. The French Concession police patrolling the street arrived, took him to the hospital, and he died despite treatment. Cai Yongqing was detained and brought to court. The police prosecuted him for manslaughter. The autopsy revealed that the deceased died of a ruptured spleen. Yesterday, the defendant confessed that the deceased had a pale face and was a heroin addict. He only pushed him once, causing him to fall to the ground, and did not punch him in the chest. He asked for leniency.

### Gold Prices Turn from High to Low

Due to Central Reserve Bank Notes Being Used

Yesterday, the cash gold market has been changed to trading in Central Reserve Bank notes. The price went from high to low throughout the day, entirely due to two securities firms, representing the Northern gang, aggressively selling. People's minds were quite unsettled. The initial price in the morning was 19,000 yuan, about 900 yuan higher than the price last weekend (1,800 yuan in old legal tender). Securities merchants were eager to sell, and silver shops and retail investors also rushed to sell. Gold shops were selling off, and the price dropped by 600 yuan to a low of 18,400 yuan, which was raised by 200 yuan by a certain gang buying in. At noon, it was very stable, and the closing price was 18,600 yuan, a rise of 500 yuan compared to last Saturday. The transaction was not bad. In the afternoon, the price was 18,500 yuan.

The selling price of gold jewelry per tael in silver shops, such as Daxin and its peers, was 2,000 yuan in new currency, equivalent to a rise of 450 yuan in old legal tender. The purchase price was reduced by 200 yuan. Fine silver was priced at 14.5 yuan in new currency, and silver coins on the black market were 11.5 yuan, with each coin at 7 yuan. There was a market but no transactions.

### Silver and Money Industry Exchanges Old Legal Tender

Exchanged to Central Reserve Bank Notes at a Rate of One to One

According to the resolution of the Provisional Joint Committee of the Silver and Money Industry the day before yesterday, starting yesterday (the 1st), the silver and money industry in the city will uniformly switch to Central Reserve Bank notes as the standard. All transaction ledgers, receipts, and account books will be stamped with "Converted to Central Reserve Bank Notes at a rate of two to one starting June 1, 1942". The Joint Reserve Committee of the Banking Industry issued a circular to various banks and shops, which reads as follows:

The exchange of old legal tender cash and bank drafts in old legal tender will be suspended starting June 1.

Starting June 1, the Committee will increase the exchange of bank drafts in Central Reserve Bank notes.

Starting June 1, exchange banks, entrusted exchange banks, and other correspondent banks and shops that receive old legal tender cash and bank drafts in old legal tender developed before May 31 should convert each one into "Central Reserve Bank notes" (i.e., Central Reserve Bank note cash) and "Central Reserve Bank note transfers" according to the statutory ratio of two to one, and indicate the converted amount in red numbers on the front of the instrument, and submit it for exchange or entrust it for collection separately.

For foreign bank drafts deposited into the Committee on May 30 but cleared the next day, the Committee shall collect "Central Reserve Bank notes" or Central Reserve Bank note transfers according to the statutory ratio of two to one. All banks and shops holding the Committee's deposit slips for the above-mentioned foreign bank drafts should immediately bring them to the Committee for correction.

When converting the amount of old legal tender into Central Reserve Bank notes, if the "fen" digit of the old legal tender amount is an odd number, one fen should be added to make it an even number, and then divided by two to avoid any rounding errors.

### Foreign Currencies Temporarily Suspended

New Transfer Discount

Still Requires One Hundred Yuan

Yesterday, the foreign currency market was temporarily suspended. The prices quoted by silver shops were generally 11 yuan and 11.2 jiao for military scrip, and over 400 yuan for British and American gold pounds (based on new currency prices). The rest were not traded.

The discount rate of the Money Industry Association was still 5% in the morning. The discount rate for new transfer drafts was 100 yuan per thousand yuan. The purchase price of new currency at the door of the money shops was 2 yuan, and the selling price was 2.2 yuan.

### Public Bonds Opened Yesterday Based on New Currency

Classes A and B Fell the Most, at Four Yuan

The bond market yesterday experienced sudden changes in local finance. Initially, other markets did not open, and bond trading was also suspended. Later, as other markets reopened, they were all calculated based on the old currency converted at half the value to the new currency. The bond market could not be an exception. It first used the closing price from last Saturday, converted at half value to the new currency. Any fraction of nine cents was counted as one dime. However, the limit for price fluctuations remained at four yuan, making the ups and downs even more significant than the previous eight yuan. This marked a new record in the history of bond trading.

Thus, at 10 o'clock, inquiries resumed. Before the opening, the price was still slightly lower by two yuan based on the old calculation method, with over ten thousand transactions. After the official opening, trading was extremely active. Tongli was still selling aggressively. Initially, the price was only slightly lower by two yuan, but it then plummeted sharply. Classes A and B fell to the limit of four yuan, which, combined with the previous price, had already dropped eight yuan, a truly unprecedented event. The eagerness of sellers to sell at any price was remarkable and worthy of study. However, buyers were also very enthusiastic to absorb at the lower prices. The northern firms Renfeng led the way, followed by Shunli and Tongshun, which were also noteworthy. Tongkang and Hongda were also strong. Chengkang and Xinji also absorbed a considerable amount. Others, such as Hongfa, Tongyuan, Hu Heji, Hengyu, Lianyi, Zhenhe, Jiufeng, and general retail investors, all actively absorbed. On the supply side, in addition to Tongli, there were Runde, Wuhe, Renchang, Shuikang, Xinhua, and general followers who sold, resulting in a price drop of three yuan and three dimes to four yuan. About three hundred and odd transactions took place. After the close, the price rebounded by one yuan and five dimes. The closing prices from last Saturday, converted to the new currency, are listed below for comparison.

### Chinese Stocks Suspended, Foreign Stocks Soar

Yesterday, foreign stock prices were already converted to Central Reserve Bank (CRB) notes. Various stocks rose sharply. There were rumors of repayments from Xinyi and Zhongfang factories, boosting investor confidence. Demand exceeded supply, and trading became thin. A total of two hundred and eighty-three thousand shares were traded. Jardine Spinning Mill rose from twenty-six yuan to eighteen yuan and five dimes. Zhongfang rose from twenty-five yuan to twenty-eight yuan and five dimes, then to twenty-eight yuan in the afternoon. Xinyi retreated from twenty-two or twenty-three yuan to twenty-one yuan and five dimes, with a closing price of twelve yuan. Wool rose from eleven yuan to twelve yuan, then fell back to eleven yuan and three dimes, with a closing price of eleven yuan and nine dimes. Jardine Brewery was eight yuan and eight dimes, retreating to eight yuan and two dimes. Zilaihuo was fourteen yuan. Zhongying was seventeen yuan and three dimes. Xiangtai was nineteen yuan. Steel was fourteen yuan and thirteen yuan and five dimes. Paper retreated from nine yuan to eight yuan and five dimes. Galantan was one yuan and three dimes and four cents. Diban was one yuan and six dimes. The rest were not traded. Chinese stocks were suspended for a day to discuss changing the unit to the new currency.

### Eastern Piece Goods Gradually Rise, Factory Cloth is Hoarded and Not Sold

Factory Cloth: Yesterday, due to currency changes and the shift to CRB note transactions, most participants in the cloth market adopted a wait-and-see attitude. As a result, neither coarse nor fine cloth sales opened up. Prices were extremely high. Sixteen-pound Earth brand coarse cloth was priced at one hundred and ninety yuan, and twelve-pound Earth brand fine cloth was priced at one hundred and eighty yuan. Fugui fine cloth was priced at one hundred and seventy yuan. Hearing that Eastern piece goods were rising sharply, everyone hoarded and refused to sell. Only Taohua Ms. Lin cloth was traded at two hundred and seventy yuan, which was about forty-two yuan higher per piece than the previous legal tender price.

Eastern Cloth: The spot market also used CRB notes for transactions, with prices gradually rising throughout the day. The upward trend remained strong. New orders for twelve-pound Dragon Head fine cloth opened at one hundred and two yuan in the morning and rose to two hundred and twelve yuan at the afternoon close. The afternoon opened at two hundred and twelve yuan and reached a high of two hundred and thirty-six yuan, then retreated to two hundred and thirty yuan, and closed at two hundred and thirty-three yuan. Bank orders for Dragon Head were two hundred and eight yuan, Caiqiu was two hundred and eighteen yuan, and Sijunzi Serge red orders opened at seven yuan and six cents in the morning, with a high of eight yuan and six dimes in the afternoon, and a late close of eight yuan and five dimes and a half.

### Limited Actual Sales of Woolen Fabrics

Woolen fabrics have been short in supply since January 18th. After the industry switched to CRB notes for transactions, both wholesale and retail sales have seen an invisible surge in prices, instantly curbing hoarding. Whether it's tailor shops or retail stores, business has been very slow.

### Divergent Views in the Staple Grains Market, No Official Trading Yesterday

Yesterday, due to currency issues, opinions in the staple grains market diverged, leading to a lack of interest in trading. The asking prices of buyers and sellers differed greatly, resulting in no official trading.

### Twigs Rise by Two Hundred Yuan

Twig Ling, coming from Tianjin, has seen increasingly tight market prices recently due to high exchange rates. Additionally, market inventory is also limited, while sales have been active. As a result, selling prices have been rising steadily. The previous price was one thousand two hundred yuan, but yesterday it rose to one thousand four hundred yuan.

### New Sugar Stock Orders

Yesterday, there was little trading in the sugar market due to the Central Reserve Bank notes issue. However, there were some sugar stock orders. Coarse granulated sugar stocks were priced at three hundred CRB notes, which, calculated at a ratio of two to one, was slightly higher than before. There were few other transactions.

### Cigarettes and Soap Candles Anxious and Uneasy

Cigarette selling prices were chaotic due to the abnormal currency situation, causing extreme anxiety. Various parties are searching the market for spot goods with all their might. Those holding goods are reluctant to sell. The market is tending towards easing as rumors spread that other currencies may also be accepted. Therefore, prices have slightly rebounded. As a result, selling prices for all goods have uniformly increased compared to the weekend. Da Ying brand is at sixteen thousand five hundred yuan, up three thousand yuan. Lao Dao brand is at ten thousand yuan. Pinhai brand is at seven thousand five hundred yuan. Wu Hua brand is at six thousand two hundred yuan. Xiao Xiannv brand is at six thousand seven hundred yuan, all up one thousand yuan to five or six hundred yuan. Japanese cigarettes: Golden Gun brand is at two thousand nine hundred yuan, Golden Building brand is at three thousand seven hundred yuan, Red Rose brand is at one thousand two hundred and fifty yuan, and All Green brand is at three thousand three hundred yuan, all up three or four hundred yuan. It is difficult to determine the future price trends. Wholesale sales among traders were mostly suspended yesterday, awaiting financial stability before resuming trading.

Daily necessities, which had seen sharp declines last week, saw prices trending upwards again yesterday. Due to public anxiety, people are buying up real goods, causing prices to continue rising. Phoenix brand is at seven thousand yuan per case, Beauty brand is at seven thousand two hundred yuan, Miscellaneous brands are at five thousand five hundred yuan, Guben soap is at five hundred yuan, Bai Xiangmao is at four hundred and forty yuan, Huang Xiangmao soap is at four hundred yuan, Scissors soap is at four hundred and twenty yuan, and Baili’s foreign candles are at one hundred and thirty yuan, Kuai brand is at two hundred and ten yuan. They have all risen sharply. Overall, due to a lack of sellers, the market is showing a "price without goods" situation.

### Weak Purchasing Power in Hardware

The hardware market has been inactive recently because business from out-of-town clients has been cut off. The purchasing power of local factories has also weakened. Moreover, it is difficult to obtain material transfer permits. Therefore, the market remains quiet. Today, there is talk of switching to selling in CRB notes, so hardware will naturally be no exception. As a result, price reductions for hardware were high again yesterday. Sales of various colors are gradually decreasing. Buyers are mostly taking a wait-and-see approach.

### Nearsightedness

— Xinghua

Recently, the degree of my nearsightedness has deepened, so I went to the company to have it checked again, because my lenses have a ten-year warranty, and the power can be changed within ten years. After the examination, the optometrist said, "Your nearsightedness is very deep now. You must try to prevent it from increasing in the future." He told me that my nearsightedness had increased by 100 degrees compared to last year. So, I made an appointment to pick them up in four days. I stepped out of the company and walked down the street, looking around blankly. I saw a mass of black shadows rushing towards me, making me dodge repeatedly.

Because of the physiological nearsightedness, I also thought of psychological nearsightedness. The number of people living in the city who are physiologically nearsighted increases every year, and the number of those who are psychologically nearsighted increases even more, and their degree of nearsightedness is also deepening day by day. I hope that everyone will first examine their own psychological nearsightedness, and then go to the optician to get glasses, otherwise, being in this world is like a nearsighted person crashing around on the road without glasses, and even more dangerous!

### Bullfighting

— Ru

When watching "Blood and Sand," a lady was even wiping away tears. Compassion is something everyone has. I knew she must have been mourning the unfortunate fate of the bullfighter who used his blood to exchange for honor and was fatally injured in the midst of the audience's cheers. According to Shakespeare's saying that "life is a tragedy," the protagonist's death was worth the price. Although I didn't shed tears, my sorrowful mood was the same as that lady's. I not only pitied that man, but also felt sad about the killing of the ferocious Spanish "black dragon spear".

Bullfighting is said to be a legacy of the martial spirit of ancient times. It was not only popular in Spain and Mexico, but also the scenes in Western novels of ancient Roman nobles using human-bull fights as entertainment seemed to be still playing out before my eyes. Although there is India, which worships cows in Asia, we Chinese also have bullfighting customs. Chen Qiyuan's "Yongxian Qi Suibi" contains a record of the bullfighting customs in Chaozhou. "...When villagers pray for blessings and hold sacrificial ceremonies, there is often a bullfighting event. Bullfighting is a kind of entertainment ceremony for the gods." However, the bullfighting often causes the bull owners to have disputes over face. Both sides seek famous bulls. Although it is not a human-bull fight, if both sides refuse to admit defeat, after the bullfighting, there will inevitably be a tragedy for the followers as the ending.

The bull hero under Chen Qiyuan's pen is treated with great respect before going to the battlefield. He lies in a green silk tent, eats white rice, and is even given the best wine to drink. When he is about to go to the battlefield, he is draped in silk ribbons and flowers, led by sixteen people in front and followed by sixteen people behind. He is really imposing. If the bull hero wins, it is really amazing, with flutes and gongs blowing, and ostentatious publicity. If the bull hero unfortunately fails, is injured, or dies, then his future fate is also decided. Before the next day, everyone can already eat the bull hero's meat in the "Taibai Legacy" restaurant. If the bull hero had self-awareness and recalled the clanging of gongs leading the way and drums blowing behind him, and the cheers of thousands of people, he would not be able to help but shed tears when he became a loser with a sharp knife on the left and an axe on the right.

Looking at it this way, the fate of the big black bull in "Blood and Sand" has long been guessed. A large plate of fragrant and steaming beef slices must be placed in front of the gentlemen in a few hours. While everyone says, "Please, please," they talk about the colorful scene of the human-bull fight while tasting the beauty of the meat. When the gentlemen wipe their greasy mouths and straighten their stiff collars, another bullfighting show will probably begin.

Alas, "Talented people come forth from the country, each leading the way for five hundred years."

### Talking About Dreams

— Rooster

When overwhelmed by firewood, rice, oil, salt, or children and old people, I often say with emotion, "Life is a big dream." This statement certainly has the meaning of self-consolation or self-mockery.

Recently, because of extreme neurasthenia, I have a lot of dreams. Lying in bed, I often wake up crying or laughing from dreams. I dream of people I have missed for many years, and I also dream of friends thousands of miles away. When I wake up, my body is still lying in bed, and the surroundings are still the real world. I feel that crying and laughing are unnecessary, and dreams are also unnecessary. If life is really a dream, then when I wake up, I will definitely regret why I took the joys, sorrows, and pleasures in the dream so seriously?

In the past, my old grandmother, when she saw her grandson wake up crying in the cradle, gently patted her grandson and said piously to the others, "He dreamed of his mother in his previous life." My old grandmother believed that life is reincarnation. There is a previous life before there is this life; there is this life before there is the next life. She affirmed that the baby's dream crying was because he saw his mother in his previous life. Now I often wake up crying from dreams, and what I see is not my mother in my previous life, but the terrible real world. Perhaps my old grandmother's words are not credible, or perhaps it is because I am no longer a baby.

It is said that many religious figures or philosophers, they have studied from black hair to white hair, and delved into what life is? Or is life a dream? Until now, there seems to be no definitive answer. However, regardless of whether life is a dream or not, if the body is cold, I want to wear clothes; if the stomach is hungry, I want to eat something; this is real and unavoidable. This may be the only reason why some people know that life is a dream, but they still want to pursue wealth and glory in the dream?

Recently, because of extreme neurasthenia, I seem to be more sentimental. I often think about "life," a question that seems solvable but is actually unsolvable. When I think about it and see no way through, I feel that Ms. Bing Xin's words in her "Wan Yin's Last Letter" are quite meaningful. The gist is: if life is happy, this life is enough, why have a next life? If life is painful, this life is also enough, why have a next life?

### No Shave, No Head

— SK

Recently, the signboards of third-class barber shops have reached around five yuan. For small clerks, a haircut once a month is considered a significant burden. No wonder many colleagues keep their hair as long as Taoist priests from Maoshan. Today, I have found three economic barber shops, which I will introduce to you.

Shanghai Banking and Money Industry Association. The location is on the sixth floor of Cishu Building. The price for members is one yuan and eight dimes, and for non-members it is two yuan. Shaving for members is one yuan and two dimes, and for non-members it is one yuan and five dimes.

Hualian Alumni Association. The location is at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Jiangxi Road. The price for members is one yuan and eight dimes, and for non-members it is two yuan.

Yiyou Society. The location is at No. 13 Fusui Lane, Tianjin Road. The society has recently reorganized and reformed, and the barber shop has been moved from downstairs to upstairs. According to the person in charge of the society, the barber shop will open no later than the beginning of next month. The price for members will be approximately one yuan and eight dimes, and for non-members it will be one yuan. Shaving for members will be one yuan and two dimes, and for non-members it will be one yuan and five dimes.

### "Equality"

— Aishi

A rich man and a beggar approached a pancake stall at the same time to buy pancakes.

The rich man took out a five-yuan bill, and the beggar took out several five-cent coins.

"Not selling!" The pancake owner refused to trade with them in a contemptuous and cold tone.

"Why?" the rich man and the beggar asked the question in protest at the same time.

"Yours is too big, yours is too small." The pancake owner replied to the rich man and the beggar separately in this way.

The rich man said sympathetically to the beggar: "We are both unable to buy things with money, the money is said to be too big, the money is said to be too small, this is really what is called..."

"Isn't this called [equality]?" the beggar interjected.

### Seemingly Right But Actually Wrong

— Shi Yetang

Customer: Buy two packs of cigarettes. I have five-yuan singles, okay?

Shopkeeper: Can't make change for a single bill!

Customer: A shortage of single bills must greatly affect your store's business, right?

Shopkeeper: Not necessarily, because most customers use single bills to buy things.

Customer: Then, there shouldn't be a shortage of single bills!

Shopkeeper: ......

### Sharing the Same Boat Through Storms

— He Jia Zhi

(5) Returning Kindness with Kindness

Wei Cheng saw that Guo Qi was unwilling to talk, and he could not force him, so he lay down again, feeling listless. The next day, Wei Cheng still had some unfinished matters to take care of, so he got up very early. He went to Shuangmei Study, but Cuizhen was already sitting there. Wei Cheng said, "Sister Cuizhen, good morning. Are you completely well?" Cuizhen said, "I'm well." Wei Cheng said, "You really don't want to rest a bit. You just got a little better and got up again. I guess the house is neat and tidy, and it's you who did it. Let them do these things. We have servants at home." Cuizhen said, "Chengdi, I have something to discuss with you."

Wei Cheng thought that Cuizhen had something to ask of him again, so he smiled. "Sister Cuizhen, you said it well, discuss with me, what is it? Just tell me. Is it money? How much?" Cuizhen shook her hand and said, "No, no. Chengdi, look at my eyes, are they red?" Wei Cheng saw a few strands of red in her whites, suspecting that she had been crying, but she was smiling at him. He couldn't guess what the reason was. Cuizhen said again, "I didn't sleep all night. That Miss Chen is so nice to people. We talked until dawn. I have a strange habit, I don't want to sleep when it dawns. Miss Chen fell asleep. I didn't sleep all night, so my eyes are red, right? Miss Chen wants me to accompany her to Shanghai. I really can't refuse. Last night, Auntie came to the back room and said that it would be good to go to Shanghai for a walk. I'm just afraid that Chengdi will say that I want to go to Shanghai to play too much. Chengdi, do you think I can go or not?" Seeing that Cuizhen was very happy, Wei Cheng thought that she was enduring silently living in Fei Changhe's house. Living in his own house, she was also working hard. How could he not agree to her going out to have fun? He nodded repeatedly and said, "Sister Cuizhen, why don't you go? Guofang, she is a very good friend. Her brother and sister are both good. Don't wear white cloth shoes, and take off the white flower in your hair. When you go to someone's house, no matter what they avoid, you must always prevent others from avoiding it." Cuizhen said, "I know that." Wei Cheng said again, "Sister Cuizhen, how many days do you plan to stay?" Cuizhen said, "Miss Chen said that if I am willing to stay for a week, she will send me back, and she will come back to stay for another week." Wei Cheng said, "That's great. But I have a word of advice for Sister Cuizhen. When you are at Guofang's house, don't be like you are here, grabbing everything to do. You are a guest, you are Guofang's friend." Cuizhen waved her hand and said, "Chengdi, do you think I'm a fool? I'm almost at home here; at Miss Chen's house, I'm at Miss Chen's house. Can't I tell the difference?" (91)

### Hoarding Two Cases of Soap

— Qiu Zong

This is just a fact of the past month. I am doomed to be trapped in the abyss of sin forever and unable to extricate myself.

A month ago, I was still a pure heart. I hated hoarders and the unreasonable rise in prices. But, unfortunately, one day came when a friend visited me. He had recently made a fortune by hoarding goods, so he talked to me about the great principles of making a fortune. It seemed that if you didn't hoard goods, you couldn't survive in this turbulent Shanghai. Finally, he warned me seriously and said, "A poor teacher like you who earns more than two hundred yuan a month may have to beg from door to door in the future. So I advise you to buy some goods with the money you have left. Even if the cost of living is high, the value of goods is high. You can still maintain it." These words made me a little startled. After he left, I quietly discussed it with my wife. As a result, we decided to buy two cases of soap with the thousand yuan we had saved. When the goods were delivered, they naturally had other means. Before long, two cases of soap were quietly lying under my bed, but my heart had since become selfish and greedy. I looked forward to the soap rising, and the prices rising. I often went to the cigarette and paper store to ask about the price of soap. When I heard that it was four hundred yuan a case, my heart was as happy as if I had picked up gold, because I bought it for three hundred and twenty yuan. But when I asked myself clearly, I was doing no different than aiding and abetting evil and adding insult to injury. I can't harm the lives of millions of people for my own life. I now believe that there are many people who are using the word "life" as an excuse to do the hoarding business. In fact, they are all fish in a big net. Small baits lure us to worry about our lives and compete to be hooked. We are still the ones who suffer, because first, we have no way to transport them; second, the selling price is driven up and down by them, and we get very little. So I sold the two cases of soap overnight. From then on, I could restore my pure conscience, and from then on I also understood that this is an era of suffering. There is no fluke, no selfish enjoyment. Only by enduring hardship together, helping each other, and understanding each other, can we safely pass this terrible journey. If it is always as chaotic as it is today, and the cost of living only increases, it is equivalent to a silent self-slaughter. In the end, the fisherman will still benefit. Dear readers, the Jews are a good example for us. Don't let a foreign reporter say that two Chinese people are like crabs, and they will start to fight each other!
