### Disease, Medicine, and Drugs

Currently, among the social problems in this city, besides the food problem, the one that most ordinary citizens find difficult to cope with is probably the issue of disease and medical care. According to the habits of ordinary citizens, they do not include the expenses for disease and medical treatment in their household budgets. However, in reality, everyone is inevitably affected by diseases, especially the working class citizens. On the one hand, they have to work harder to barely maintain their livelihoods, leaving them with little ability to care for their health. On the other hand, due to financial difficulties, their daily nutrition is certainly inadequate, and even when they get sick, they avoid seeking medical treatment, dragging on day after day. Thus, the problem of medical care becomes more serious every day. Of course, this is a serious social problem that cannot be fully resolved in a short period. However, we cannot ignore the fact that there are still many man-made undesirable phenomena. The existence of these negative phenomena increases the infinite suffering of citizens and also increases social crises. We must point out these bad phenomena and especially hope that the Public Works Department, the municipal authorities, and the medical community will work together to eliminate them.

First, in terms of medical care, there are quite a few public and private medical institutions in this city, and the number of Chinese and Western doctors is certainly not small. According to general principles, as long as everyone works hard, citizens should not feel too much suffering from seeking medical treatment. However, along with the soaring prices, the fees for diagnosis and treatment also seem to have skyrocketed. Because of the sky-high medical expenses, the majority of citizens feel intimidated by both Chinese and Western doctors, as well as public and private hospitals. Secondly, when it comes to the diagnosis and treatment provided by doctors, one cannot help but worry about the health of the majority of citizens. It is said that many famous Chinese medicine doctors see as many as one or two hundred patients every day. The average diagnosis for each patient is only one or two minutes. To say that they can provide careful diagnosis and treatment in such a short time is truly a myth. This kind of "perfunctory work" by "famous doctors" has not been stopped by society to this day, which cannot be said to be a misfortune for society. Of course, this situation is not limited to Chinese medicine doctors. It is inevitable that a few Western doctors also neglect the diagnosis and treatment of patients.

Second, in terms of medicine, whether it is Chinese or Western pharmacies, in this wave of rising prices, the prices of medicine have also increased accordingly. Therefore, most patients often barely manage to scrape together the medical fees, only to be scared off by the shockingly high cost of medicine. Furthermore, precisely because of the exorbitant prices of medicine, the due morality of a few pharmacists has gradually diminished. As a result, in Chinese medicine, they inevitably cut corners, and in Western medicine, they sell expired drugs as usual. In addition, ordinary non-pharmacists also see the potential for profit in medicine, competing to hoard and counterfeit. As a result, drug prices rise daily, and drug quality deteriorates daily, further jeopardizing the health of millions of citizens.

Some public hospitals and private medical institutions also have "free treatment for the poor and sick" measures in response to the aforementioned phenomena, which is truly commendable. However, on the one hand, the number of such doctors and hospitals is too small, and their power is limited, so they cannot do much to remedy the situation. On the other hand, even with "free treatment for the poor and sick," there are still many areas that need improvement. Not to mention private institutions, even public institutions have many problems with the fees waived for the "poor and sick." Often, the truly impoverished do not receive the benefits of free treatment and are turned away from the hospital. For those who need to be hospitalized, they still have to prepay hundreds of dollars for medical expenses, which is nominally free but not in reality. However, those who are not truly poor and sick, but are introduced by "prominent figures" or have personal connections, can enjoy the "privilege" of free treatment.

We believe that this phenomenon in the medical and pharmaceutical community can no longer be allowed to continue. We hope that the authorities and enthusiastic people in the medical and pharmaceutical community will work together to find ways to improve the situation. We request the Public Works Department and the municipal authorities to allocate more public funds, actively plan to increase and improve public hospitals, and at the same time establish public pharmacies to supply medicines at fair prices, so that the health of ordinary working-class citizens can be guaranteed. These are important steps to eliminate social crises and increase social well-being.

### The German-Soviet Struggle in the Severe Cold - December 22nd Osaka Mainichi Newspaper Editorial

On the German-Soviet battlefront, the second severe cold has arrived. At this time last winter, an unprecedented cold wave struck the battlefront, rendering the modern weapons of both attacking and defending forces useless, making active combat impossible. The climatic conditions in the Soviet inland this winter are slightly different from last winter. The Soviet Union attempted to use climatic conditions to help repel the German forces in early winter last year; however, this attempt failed. Then, the same expectation was placed on this winter. However, until today, the cold around the battle lines has been relatively mild, and the movement of aircraft, tanks, and heavy artillery has not been hindered. Hitler had already declared when this winter arrived. The German forces' preparations for winter warfare have been completed without any omissions. In other words, even if they encounter the same severe cold as last winter, they are fully prepared to win. Facing such a formidable enemy, does the Soviet Union have the confidence to defeat the enemy in the severe cold? In the end, we must give a negative answer.

The burden and consumption of the Soviet Union in the year and a half since the start of the war has been very large. In desperation, they had no choice but to beg for support from external forces. Unfortunately, the bark is worse than the bite. The expected aid from the United States and Britain is nothing remarkable. Even the aid of natural forces, the bitterly cold weather they have been praying for every day, has not materialized as they wished. Even so, whether out of bravery or recklessness, the Red Army stubbornly tried a winter counter-offensive. Since late November, the counter-offensive around Stalingrad has suddenly expanded. This counter-offensive was launched almost simultaneously from the northwest, south, southwest, and even from the bend of the Don River. The German authorities also had to admit in their announcement on the 24th: "A large force, carrying a large number of weapons, successfully invaded the German positions." In the south, from south of Stalingrad, Kotelnikovo, to the Terek River in the North Caucasus, a counter-offensive began on this long line several days ago. On the line connecting Moscow and Leningrad, with the aim of breaking through the German positions between these two key points, fierce attacks were attempted in the southwest of Kalinin, Rzhev, south of Lake Ilmen, Toropets, and Velikiye Luki. We can say that a counterattack operation has begun on almost the entire battle line. Although the cold is much less severe than in previous years, temperatures of minus 20 degrees Celsius are common, and sometimes there are also violent blizzards. The scene on the battlefield is extremely desolate.

However, the German forces currently have the momentum to repel the counter-offensive. First, in the north, the Red Army units, mainly consisting of twelve sniper divisions and fourteen tank brigades, were defeated at Rzhev. The Red Army in the Kalinin area also collapsed early. In Toropets, Velikiye Luki, and other places, the German forces completely annihilated the attacking enemy troops. On the southernmost battle line, due to the large-scale German offensive that began on December 14, the Red Army's first line had already collapsed by the 16th. Currently, the German forces are taking advantage of the victory to pursue the attack towards the Caspian Sea and the Volga River. The most intense battles are of course taking place around Stalingrad. The German forces, commanding the motley troops of Italy, Hungary, and Romania, are not only sufficient to resist the Red Army's counter-offensive, but, as announced by the Soviet Information Bureau on the 15th, have also caused the Red Army to begin a partial retreat. In this way, the Red Army's counter-offensive attempt has been completely thwarted. The resulting losses are also very considerable.

Obviously, at the beginning of this decisive battle, the top brass of the Red Army made a big miscalculation. Stalin pointed out that the advance of the American and British forces into French North Africa could not be regarded as the second front that the Soviet Union had hoped for. However, later, the North African front significantly restrained the German forces. The Soviet Union recognized this and took action to echo the American and British forces in North Africa. Unfortunately, contrary to expectations, the enemy in front has not loosened its pressure at all. Now, what the Soviet authorities must re-examine is the German statement of November 17. In that statement, the German side emphasized that, from the overall perspective of the European war situation, the focus remains on the Eastern Front. Even if the North African war situation expands further, the German forces' operations on the Eastern Front will not be affected. From this statement, the future German-Soviet war situation can be roughly determined. (Translation by Hui)

### Heavy Snow Falls on the Eastern Front, Fighting Continues - Six Soviet Offensives Between the Volga River and the Don River Bend Fail to Achieve Success

Headquarters of the German Leader, 28th, Haitian News Agency - This afternoon's German military report stated that Soviet forces attacking in the Terek area had 59 tanks destroyed. As a result of the fierce bombing by the German, Italian, and Romanian air forces, enemy casualties were very heavy. Soviet forces in the central part of Eastern Europe once attacked German positions without success. Soviet elite troops and tank units southeast of Lake Ilmen, although covered by artillery and tanks, failed to make progress. On the northern front, port facilities in Liepāja Peninsula and Murmansk were heavily bombed by our aircraft.

Berlin, 28th, Haitian News Agency - During the Christmas period, the weather on the Eastern Front was difficult to reduce, averaging between minus 20 and 30 degrees Celsius, with northwest winds howling and rain and snow flying. However, fighting continued as usual. From the 24th to the 26th, the fighting between the Volga River and the Don River Bend was more important. The Soviet Union launched six consecutive offensives, all of which failed to achieve success. The German defenders, with the assistance of the air force, repelled all enemy forces. The German counter-offensive penetrated deep into the enemy rear and destroyed many enemy tanks in the middle reaches of the Don River. The other day, German forces and allied forces launched a joint counter-offensive, forcing the Soviet forces to abandon important positions and retreat.

Somewhere on the Soviet Border, 27th, Havas News Agency - According to news from the Eastern Front, the Red Army has attempted to take advantage of the cold climate to improve its positions. Therefore, the Red Army General Staff has launched four offensives. First, an offensive was launched near the city of Velikiye Luki, using the area between Toropets and Velikiye Luki as its base. However, near the city of Velikiye Luki, it encountered very strong German defenses. The Red Army's frontal offensive seems to have been crushed. The second offensive saw the Red Army advancing from the city of Velikiye Luki to the city of Ganino (south of the city of Velikiye Luki), attempting to break through the German lines and aiming to recover the railway center of Nevel. However, the Soviet side has remained silent on this move, which apparently did not achieve any progress. Its main offensive occurred in the middle reaches of the Don River. After 11 days of fierce fighting, the Red Army suffered heavy losses, but fresh troops were transferred to the front line to reinforce them, arriving in an endless stream. The Red Army tried several times to break through the German lines, but the location of both sides' positions has not yet been determined. According to German sources, Red Army troops who invaded the German pocket were all annihilated. The third offensive was launched a few days ago, when the Red Army attacked west of the city of Kalach-na-Donu. The Soviet authorities attempted to encircle the German troops fighting in the city, but the German forces near the Volga River number no less than 22 divisions. It is unbelievable that these troops can all be encircled by the Red Army. In addition, the Red Army launched a fourth offensive in the Baksan Valley district of the Caucasus. In short, the achievements made by the Red Army at certain points have no decisive nature. The Red Army General Headquarters has apparently encountered many difficulties. The climate is less favorable to the Red Army than last year, which is one reason. The Red Army also feels a shortage of mechanical equipment, which is the second reason. The Red Army lacks excellent officers, which is the third reason. The Red Army's command opinions are also inconsistent. General Staff Chief Shaposhnikov advocated that the Red Army should launch guerrilla warfare along the German's long lines of communication, while General Timoshenko advocated concentrating mechanized units and cavalry for frontal attacks, which is the fourth reason.

Berlin, 27th, Central News Agency - According to German military sources, German aircraft raided transportation facilities near Moscow on the night of the 26th. A major fire broke out on the railway north of the city. Another squadron attacked the airfield in the area and the highway transportation units northwest of Moscow, achieving considerable results.

### German Forces Consolidate Positions in the Foothills of the Atlas Mountains - US Announces Air Force Losses in Africa - Hull Admits to Major Crisis

Rome, 28th, Haitian News Agency - This afternoon's Italian military report stated that small-scale offensives by British and American forces in Tunisia were repelled. In aerial combat, German aircraft shot down one enemy multi-engine aircraft. German aircraft again attacked Algiers and Bône yesterday. Enemy aircraft attacked Sfax and one was shot down by anti-aircraft guns.

Berlin, 28th, Haitian News Agency - Berlin expressed deep satisfaction today with the consolidation of the Axis forces' position in Tunisia. After the Axis forces captured Médiéz-el-Bab, 32 kilometers southwest of Tébouba, and its surrounding Allied strongholds, the entire area east of the city is now in the hands of the Axis forces. On Saturday, the German front line advanced westward. Although the American forces occupied strong positions, they did not offer fierce resistance and retreated westward. According to news from central Tunisia, the Axis forces fighting in the eastern foothills of the Atlas Mountains have consolidated their positions to prevent enemy forces from entering the mountainous areas of western Tunisia. Air force activity was very active in the skies over French North Africa on Saturday, with large numbers of aircraft participating in the fighting on both sides. Allied aircraft bombed Bizerte during the day, but were dispersed by German Messerschmitt aircraft before reaching their target and five enemy aircraft were shot down. Haitian News Agency learned that this message detailed that the five aircraft included one four-engine giant bomber and the remaining four aircraft were Spitfire aircraft. After the failed raid on Bizerte, the remaining enemy aircraft flew back to the forward airfield in northern Algeria, but were attacked again by German aircraft. An American long-range transport aircraft and two medium bombers were hit and caught fire. Several aircraft parked on the ground were also damaged by shrapnel. Italian aircraft raided the port of Bône that evening. The port facilities were hit and caught fire. A barracks near Cape Noir was destroyed. Italian torpedo aircraft attacked British and American convoys transporting supplies off the coast of Algeria. One ship was hit and exploded into fragments. When German aircraft raided enemy convoys near Bougie at night, four enemy ships were severely damaged, including a 10,000-ton passenger-cargo ship. Another ship carrying 7,000 tons of cargo was also attacked by air, and the damage was so severe that it could hardly be used again.

Lisbon, 28th, DOMEI News Agency - According to a Washington report, the US Department of the Army announced that since the start of operations in North Africa, British and American forces have lost a total of 114 aircraft, 59 of which were American aircraft.

Lisbon, 27th, Central News Agency - According to a dispatch from Washington, US Secretary of State Hull explained the current situation in North Africa when he met with a group of reporters on the 26th, and pointed out that the anti-Axis countries in the war in that area have a major crisis. The gist of the statement was that although the operations of the anti-Axis forces in North Africa are gradually progressing, they are now at a dangerous stage. Therefore, Commander Eisenhower and his staff are currently doing their best to seek the cooperation of various anti-Axis countries in order to cope with this danger.

### World-Renowned Billionaire Aga Khan Passes Away; Known as the "Living Buddha" of Islam During His Lifetime; Followers Scattered Across East Africa and Central Asia

Geneva, Switzerland, 27th (Havas News Agency) - The world-renowned billionaire Aga Khan, known as the "Living Buddha" of Islam, passed away today in Lahore, Punjab Province, India, at the age of 65. Aga Khan was born in 1877 and was a descendant of Muhammad. He was the leader of the "Hashshashin" sect, a famous medieval religious group with followers scattered across East Africa, Central Asia, and India. He attended the coronation ceremony of the British monarch in 1902. After World War I, he was listed as a "First-Class Head of State." From 1930 to 1931, he served as the chief representative of India at the London Round Table Conference. From 1932 to 1935, he served as the chief representative of India at the League of Nations. The Khan was also famous in European social circles for his love of horse racing. His horses won the Epsom Derby in 1930, 1935, and 1936. In 1929, he married a common French woman, Garron. He owned a luxurious villa on the French Riviera and often stayed there. On his 60th birthday in 1937, his followers collected a quantity of gold equal to his weight and presented it to him, which he immediately donated to charity.

### Laval Seeks to Strengthen Cooperation with the Axis Powers; Four Plans in Preparation for Implementation; Military Rebuilding to be Temporarily Delayed

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) - According to a Domei News Agency dispatch from Zurich, the assassination of Darlan can be considered temporarily concluded with Giraud's succession as chairman. However, the incident exposed the disagreements between Britain and the United States and the internal strife within the government, as well as the various discussions it has sparked, which cannot be suppressed. It is expected that the military and political efforts of the anti-Axis forces will become increasingly difficult. According to some sources, French leader Laval is actively working to strengthen cooperation with the Axis powers, following the agreement between the leaders of Germany and France. It is expected that Premier Laval intends to implement the following measures to consolidate the domestic system: (1) Designating an area of 50 square kilometers in the French border and coastal areas as occupied territory by the Axis forces, after which the government will return to Paris; (2) Sending skilled workers and other laborers to German military factories to exchange for French farmers captured by the German army, in order to revive French agriculture; (3) Forming a single political party in France to strengthen its political position. However, regarding the formation of the party, it is rumored that right-wing figures such as Trianon and Marcel Déat will also resume activities. However, considering that after the German-French talks, the German Foreign Ministry stated that it would always consider Premier Laval as its counterpart, it is clear that the party will be headed by Premier Laval; (4) Due to past disagreements between newspapers in Paris and Vichy, the French government will reorganize various media organs to unify them. Furthermore, according to a dispatch from Ankara, the rebuilding of the French army will be temporarily delayed due to its considerable difficulty and complexity.

### Judicial and Administrative Conference; Proposals Complete

Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency) - The National Judicial and Administrative Conference convened by the Ministry of Judicial Administration has received no fewer than 300 proposals from various regions, divided into four groups: (1) Judicial organization and funding; (2) Civil and criminal litigation; (3) Prisons; (4) Judge training and others. These proposals have been completely organized. It is reported that the representatives from North China have been decided as Zu Ze, Zhang Yusheng, Liu Zhiyi, Gui Buji, Qi Yunji, Li Dong, and Li Baohua. Furthermore, representatives from all regions must register no later than the day before the conference (January 10th), it is said.

### Chief of General Staff Kawabe Addresses Foreign Correspondents

Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency) - Lieutenant General Masazo Kawabe, Chief of General Staff of the Japanese Expeditionary Force in China, met with a group of foreign correspondents stationed in Nanjing on the 27th and stated that the Expeditionary Force would intensify its operations in order to destroy the Chongqing government and advance together with the National Government towards the goal of completing the war. The main points of his speech are as follows: "I firmly believe that in order to destroy Chongqing, it is essential to unify political and military strategies. When the Greater East Asia War broke out a year ago, Chongqing was quite pleased, believing that final victory was at hand. However, upon seeing the disastrous defeats of Britain and the United States, they were deeply disappointed. Moreover, the Japanese army's operations have destroyed Chongqing's war-making capacity, plunging the Chongqing government into an unprecedented crisis. Today, the lack of equipment for the Chongqing army is becoming increasingly apparent, so their resistance has had to become passive. However, Chongqing's propaganda organs, in order to suppress the general public's war-weariness, are carrying out extensive propaganda, claiming that China's salvation depends on the victory of Britain and the United States. This kind of false propaganda, ignoring the realities of the situation, has failed to have any effect. Regarding the friction between Chongqing and the Communists, Chongqing's desire to invade the Northwest to prevent the expansion of Communist power, as seen in the development of the Northwest route, is clearly to prevent the expansion of the Communist sphere of influence. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the National Government immediately issued a statement, resolving to share weal and woe and cooperate in completing the war, and then launched the New National Movement, expanded the "Qingxiang" (cleansing the countryside) areas, unified the currency, and reorganized the army, etc., in order to strengthen its power. In particular, the reorganization of the army has been progressing smoothly since October, and the strength of the troops has been gradually increased, and the equipment has gradually reached modern standards. At this time when the earth returns to spring and the new year is approaching, the Japanese Expeditionary Force in China will single-mindedly concentrate its efforts on carrying out operations in order to destroy the Chongqing government."

### Japanese Government Decides to Cancel New Year's Holiday

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) - Due to the wartime situation, the Japanese government has decided to cancel the year-end and New Year's holidays starting from the 28th. It is planned to hold a cabinet meeting as usual on the 29th, and a regular vice-ministerial meeting will also be held on the 31st. Except for holidays on New Year's Day and the 3rd and 5th, offices will operate as usual on the 2nd, and a regular cabinet meeting will also be held on the 4th. All agencies, from ministers to employees, will follow this procedure.

### The Japanese Economy in the Past Year Under the Greater East Asia War

In today's large-scale war, the foundation of victory on the front lines undoubtedly rests on a strong economy in the rear. In the past year, under the swift and decisive policies of the Japanese government authorities, Japan's wartime economy has concentrated all productive forces on completing the war. Furthermore, due to the promotion of a highly centralized controlled economy, the national industrial and economic structure has also been completely reorganized, thereby establishing an economic system that is sure to win.

War is construction; this is the only key to Japan's promotion of a wartime economy. Even in the midst of the most enormous consumption, it has overcome all difficulties due to the continuous strengthening of war-making capacity, and has even gone on to carry out a magnificent and broad regional economic construction throughout the Greater East Asia region. Solid wartime economic power has therefore become increasingly enhanced.

The "Materials Mobilization Plan" decided by the Japanese cabinet on April 14th has established the basic national policy for a planned war economy. At the same time, various promotion plans have been established, centering on (1) enhancing military equipment, (2) strengthening maritime transportation capacity, and (3) setting up a Greater East Asia trade plan.

In addition, a materials mobilization plan for daily necessities has been compiled, and policies to ensure the livelihood of the people have been stipulated in the national plan. This is a mobilization of the utmost significance. This further indicates that Japan's national plan has achieved comprehensive strengthening. After May, several cabinet meetings successively decided on the "1942 Productivity Expansion Plan," the "National Labor Mobilization Plan," the "Transportation Mobilization Plan and Electricity Mobilization Plan," and the "First Mobilization Plan for Essential Consumer Goods," etc. These plans have been gradually prepared and completed as the war situation has developed. On July 18th, the cabinet decided on the principle of prioritizing important national policies in the budget, so that the entire fiscal system could be completely aligned with the national plan, and the budget would become the cornerstone of the national plan as a fiscal plan.

Next, looking at the transition of the control mechanism, at the beginning of the war, the Japanese government first decided on financial countermeasures for the emergency period, clarifying that the government would not take emergency measures such as restricting people from withdrawing deposits, which stabilized public morale. Subsequently, the 78th session of the Diet was convened to decide on enemy property management and various other emergency measures. Later, in the 79th session of the Diet, a true war system was established, creating an unprecedented 30 billion yen wartime budget. At the same time, major tax increases on direct taxes, the Bank of Japan Law, the Wartime Finance Corporation Law, the Southern Development Finance Corporation Law, the Important Materials Management Corporation Law, etc., were also decided. In addition, the establishment of the Greater East Asia Construction Deliberation Council and the reorganization of small and medium-sized businesses and industries, etc., were also decided. All of these measures have achieved satisfactory results in the past year, laying the foundation for the wartime economy. In addition, it is worth noting that the 80th session of the Diet decided to implement the "Planned Shipbuilding Program," while the reorganization of the Bank of Japan and the establishment of the currency management system and the National Financial Control Association, etc., have entered another stage of the new financial system. In addition, the merger of the electricity business implemented from April 1st, and the state management of maritime transport, the establishment of the Rail Control Association, etc., have also substantially strengthened financial, transportation, power, and other war facilities. Next, in order to enhance the productive capacity of important industries, control associations were established separately in accordance with the "Important Industry Group Order," such as the Copper, Iron, and Coal Control Association, which had already been established before the Greater East Asia War. Other mining, cement, vehicle, machinery, metal, industrial, trade, shipbuilding, and other control associations were also established separately by the end of January. Control associations such as light metals, chemical industry, rubber, leather, oils and fats, textiles, wool, and hemp were also formed successively by August 4th. By this point, all kinds of important industries had established powerful control mechanisms.

It must be pointed out here that the situation of the Greater East Asia War, on the one hand, is a long-term war of attrition, and on the other hand, it is a life-and-death battle on which the survival of 1 billion people in East Asia depends. Therefore, whether the economic power of each East Asian country is enhanced or not will directly affect the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, the construction of a broad regional economy in Greater East Asia is necessary. In fact, China and Manchukuo have already cooperated with Japan, and the progress of the reconstruction in various parts of the South has also caused the entire Greater East Asia construction to begin in the midst of "war on one hand, construction on the other." This will naturally make Japan's wartime economy more substantial, so that it can carry out a long-term war of ten or a hundred years, and it is certain that it will achieve final victory.

### A Letter on Observing the Northwest

Mr. ××:

I have been in Lanzhou for almost half a month. The ×××× Observation Group has not yet arrived. I have been visiting various places alone and have gained a lot.

The Rinderpest Problem

Yesterday, in the newspaper reading room of the Lanzhou Medical Library, I saw a report that the situation of rinderpest in Qinghai was extremely serious. Therefore, today I visited the Northwest Epidemic Prevention Institute to inquire about the current epidemic prevention situation. The institute is relatively large and was previously established for the prevention and control of animal diseases. Currently, due to the urgent need for vaccines such as cholera, typhoid, and diphtheria for military and civilian use, it has been converted to produce various vaccines, smallpox vaccines, and various sera. The amount produced over the years has been very large. In 1941, it reached 7 million doses, and this year it will exceed this number. After visiting each room in the institute, I went to the Northwest Animal Disease Prevention and Control Center. The director of administrative affairs led me on a tour. Because the center was newly built after the war, the equipment is very simple, except for some instruments sent from the Northwest Epidemic Prevention Institute, which is not sufficient to meet the task of preventing and controlling animal diseases in the entire Northwest. After visiting the serum production room, I entered the vaccine production room and saw four or five technicians dissecting a dead cow. I stared blankly, not knowing what was going on. Then, the vaccine production director, Mr. Xing, explained that the cow had not been immunized and had been injected with rinderpest virus. After a week, when it was about to die from the disease, it was killed, and the infected lymph nodes in its abdomen or intestines were taken. Then, in a room isolated from the air, it was crushed into a paste with a machine, filtered, and checked for other germs, and the vaccine was obtained. It is estimated that each cow can produce 1,000 to 1,500 cc of vaccine. The method of producing serum is to inject rinderpest virus into an immune cow, causing it to react in the cow's body. Blood is drawn once every two months for use as serum. Each cow can be used for two years, and after twelve draws, it can no longer be used. Each time, 3,000 cc of serum can be drawn. According to the above, each cow can produce 1,500 cc of vaccine, and a cow with rinderpest needs 15 cc. Therefore, the vaccine from each cow can treat 100 cows. Both serum and vaccine can treat cows with rinderpest. When using serum, 120 cc needs to be injected each time, and it needs to be injected three times, which is 360 cc. However, a cow can draw 3,000 cc at a time, a total of twelve times, which is (3000 x 12 = 36000 cc). Each treatment requires 360 cc, so 36000/360 = 100, which means that one cow can only treat 100 cows with rinderpest. The current price of a cow (because only cows are used) is 300 yuan per head. In other words, it costs 3 yuan for vaccine or serum to treat one cow. In fact, sometimes both are required, so it is definitely more than this, and all manufacturing costs and wages are not included. Currently, several counties in Gansu and Qinghai provinces are suffering from rinderpest. According to Mr. Xing, it has almost exceeded 1 million heads, and the number of deaths is probably more than the 300,000 heads reported outside. Assuming that there are 1 million cows with rinderpest, and each treatment costs 30 yuan, it would require 3 million yuan in vaccine costs. The center's funding is 560,000 yuan per year, only 40,000 yuan per month, and several thousand yuan still needs to be allocated for the expenses of the Ningxia and Qinghai branch teams. It is difficult for a clever woman to cook without rice. What can be done about this? Currently, they are rushing to produce day and night, but without more funding and without being able to add staff temporarily, letters and telegrams are pouring in from all sides, requesting vaccines and staff. Although the people involved are extremely anxious, what is the use? Mr. Xing almost burst into tears when he said this. Because the staff knows how serious the matter is, but their love cannot be extended to animals, they are really quite pained inside! Currently, the average price of each cow is 1,000 yuan. If 1 million heads die, the loss would be 100 billion yuan. This is such a large number! Everyone is just doing a perfunctory job on the surface, writing a piece of paper and considering the matter closed. It is the cows that are doomed to die, and those who depend on cows for a living are just destined to suffer!

Rescuing the Northwest

After coming to Gansu, I feel that everyone is shouting from afar to develop the Northwest, but in fact, it is more urgent to talk about rescuing the Northwest than to talk about developing it. The rinderpest mentioned above is certainly one of the real issues facing us, but I have not heard of any large sums being allocated or all veterinarians being mobilized to engage in rescue work. Disaster relief is like fighting a fire. Delaying it is useless!

Special Discussion on Animal Husbandry

Among the undertakings that need to be rescued in the Northwest, the largest are water conservancy, forestry, and animal husbandry. As long as these three undertakings are done well, the Northwest will be a land of abundance. These three undertakings are all on an existing scale, and they all only require human effort, and do not rely on any kind of machine. The rescue of water conservancy and forestry is too long to discuss, so I will omit them. Only in terms of animal husbandry, Gansu, Qinghai, and Ningxia are rich in fur and hides, and their sources are none other than cattle, horses, and sheep. The output of cattle, horses, and sheep is not certain in each province. Only Gansu Province has statistics, with 490,000 head of cattle, 88,000 head of horses, 9.1 million head of sheep, 340,000 donkeys, and 100,000 mules. However, due to the high mortality rate of cattle, horses, donkeys, and sheep, the output of hides and furs is very high. It is estimated that 139,711 cowhides, 8,854 horsehides, and 1,653,485 sheepskins (including goatskins, old sheepskins, goatskin fleece, fetal lambskins, white small wool, black and purple two-wool lambskins, black and purple lambskins, black and white goat sandpaper, and white two-wool lambskins) are produced annually, along with 1,583 donkey skins. The mortality rate of cattle is the highest, almost 3/10, and that of sheep is more than 1/10. Qinghai and Ningxia have no statistics to be found. The high mortality rate of this rinderpest can be imagined. Furthermore, cattle die mostly from plague, while sheep die mostly from freezing.

According to statistics, the total number of black and purple two-wool lambskins, black and purple lambskins, and white two-wool lambskins in Gansu mentioned above is 694,882 pieces. Because sheep mate in the spring and summer, and their births occur in the winter, the winter is severely cold, especially at night. Sheep flocks usually sleep in open-air sheep pens, and everyone crowds together in a circle to keep warm. Because the large sheep can still struggle, the small lambs are inevitably trampled to death. This is how all lambskins originate, which is such a heartbreaking thing. There is also a kind of fetal lamb, which is divided into stillbirths and abortions. Stillbirths occur naturally, and abortions are caused by humans. Because the fetal lambskin is curly and cute, resembling a pattern, it looks like flowing clouds and water. Foreign women love to use it, and its price is very high. When sheep merchants know that a sheep fetus is about to mature, they violently kick the mother sheep's abdomen with their feet, and the fetus falls out. The cruelty of this act is horrifying to hear. Currently, very few are exported. The "Trade Commission" is vigorously suppressing the price of fetal lambskins and prohibiting their export. It is hoped that the government will establish a law in the future to strictly prevent this trend from rising again after the war. The method of preventing death from freezing is not absolutely impossible. Sheep flocks are generally gathered in circles of dozens of heads. If it is possible to guide the sheep herders to provide simple coverings around and above the circle, or to house large and small sheep separately, it would be sufficient to reduce deaths. As for the prevention and control of disease and plague, it is essential that the government use large sums of money to produce vaccines and sera. Farmers are really unable to take this into consideration. In fact, this is not a losing business. Hiding wealth among the people is hiding wealth in the country, and there will naturally be a place to recoup the costs. This is a passive method of relief. As for active relief, it lies in cultivating grass sources, which is a more complex issue. It seems that heaven, geography, and people must be taken into consideration. In fact, heaven and geography have become a fixed situation. Relying on heaven and relying on earth is impossible. It is still only possible to rely on human effort, or perhaps humans can conquer nature, and the earth can return to spring.

Cultivating Vegetation

The land in the Northwest is not incapable of growing vegetation. It is really because the climate is colder, and the stems of crops are not enough to meet the needs of cooking, and there is a lack of coal under the ground, so there is no way to mine it. The only option is to cut down trees for firewood. Once the trees are cut down, they are followed by pulling out grass, often uprooting them, which affects the food of livestock such as cattle and sheep, so the number of offspring is low. Currently, it is appropriate to study what kind of vegetation is suitable for drought resistance, and then make the land for cultivating vegetation into terraced fields like those in Sichuan, so that rainwater will not flow horizontally along the slope. This may be a method for cultivating vegetation. Some people believe that the loess layer in the Northwest is very thick and does not have a stone layer underneath like the soil in Sichuan, which makes it easy to store water. However, in any case, water soaking into the soil is always better than flowing away, and it can still be used to moisturize the soil. According to recent experiments at the local agricultural improvement institute, alfalfa roots penetrate deep into the soil and are drought-resistant. After being planted last year, it also turned yellow during the drought, but it turned green again after the autumn rains. "Alfalfa follows the Heavenly Horse," which was moved from the Western Regions in the Han Dynasty, and now even this needs to be cultivated, which shows the great damage done by humans and animals. However, the vast Han Dynasty and the bare Niu Mountain are all examples of this. How could this be done by one person's hand? If the method is feasible, then everyone will know about it, and the person who promotes it must be willing to work hard and see it as a lifelong career. The matter is very difficult, but only by doing so can we change the geography, attract the harmony of heaven, and make the vegetation flourish and the cattle and sheep multiply.

The Future of Fur and Hides

In Gansu, Qinghai, and Ningxia, everyone generally believes that fur and hides are the most promising, and that the development of the Northwest is primarily focused on fur and hides. The statistics on the production of hides are not complete, and only the general outline is known. The production of wool has been centrally purchased and sold in recent years, with only over 200,000 dan of raw wool, which is only about 100,000 dan after washing and sorting, or only 5,000 tons. The number seems very small, but if we can cultivate grass sources, prevent and control animal diseases, and prevent death from freezing, the number will definitely be more than this. This is the simpler of the rescue undertakings in the Northwest. Officials and civilians who are interested in the Northwest, please start with this simpler one.

I have written this hastily, and the language is incoherent. My hands are stiff from the cold, and the handwriting is sloppy. I hope you will forgive me.

### After Metered Distribution of Rice, Sugar, and Oil, Supplies Will Also Be Rationed; Implementation Procedures Must Await Overall Planning

The relevant authorities in Shanghai Municipality have been actively studying thorough solutions to the issue of providing for all food items related to the people's livelihood and suppressing prices in recent months. Measures such as regulating supplies like rice, sugar, and oil based on household registration, and unblocking the flow of sources, are being gradually implemented to make proper remedies. A Central News Agency reporter recently learned from the relevant authorities that the Shanghai Municipal Council's metered rice distribution, which originally stipulated one and a half liters of white rice and one and a half catties of flour per period, will increase the amount of white rice soon, in addition to increasing the sale of flour by two catties per household with tickets in the next period. The metered distribution of sugar and oil in the middle of next month can also be realized. As for other daily necessities, it is said that they will also be subject to a rationing system across the board. After the implementation of the rationing system for all food items needed by the people of Shanghai, the entire plan to control prices can be thoroughly completed.

### Quantity and Price of Rice and Flour for Household Registration Will Change in the Next Period

The quantity and price of rice and flour for household registration in the two concessions will change in the next period. According to a Datong News Agency reporter, the rice for household registration in the next period will be 1.5 liters of whole rice, selling for 3.8 yuan in reserve currency, and the flour will increase to 2 catties, selling for 4.4 yuan in reserve currency. The flour will increase by half a catty compared to this period, and the selling price will also decrease by more than 1 jiao. Rice shops in the two concessions will begin to receive warehouse receipts from the Rice and Flour Allocation Office of the Shanghai Municipal Council from today, and will pick them up from the Taikoo, China, and Zhejiang Xingye warehouses in the afternoon.

### The Number of Registered Daily Necessities Businesses Is Limited; The Guild Will Be Restored

The Market of the Cigarette Industry Association previously closed its market because the prices of cigarettes and daily necessities such as matches, soap, and candles were rising in a straight line with no end in sight, fearing that this would lead to interference. Since then, although businesses have been trading with each other, they have only been able to temporarily use the road as a trading place. It is recently learned that the guild authorities have been holding meetings for days to discuss the restoration, and there has been considerable progress. Currently, they have begun to register businesses, and have stipulated that the registration limit is 300, and registration will be stopped after the limit is reached. After the market resumes in the future, only those with registration certificates will be allowed to enter the market to trade, but each business will only be allowed to send one person to the market, so that the number of people in the market will not be too large. At the same time, those requesting registration must provide a letter of application and mutual guarantees, and comply with the market rules during trading, and must not arbitrarily raise prices, causing unrest in the market. It is learned that the guild's market will be officially restored as soon as the registration is completed within days.

### Illegal Radio Receivers: Registration Deadline at Year's End

The French Concession authorities (regarding the registration of illegal radio receivers) issued a notice stating that the ten-day period stipulated in the first section of the radio receiver registration notice promulgated by this authority on the 24th of this month has expired. The office established at 733 Route Cardinal Mercier has ceased operations. Those who possess illegal radio receivers and have not yet registered are urged to complete their registration before the 31st of this month at the Wireless Radio Management Office, Room 316, Hardoon Building.

### Monetary Affairs: Increased Bill Exchange Last Month

According to a survey by the Yokohama Specie Bank, the amount of various bill exchanges in November was as follows: (1) The exchange of military scrip between Chinese banks was 332,256,066.98 yuan, an increase of 7,542,925.91 yuan compared to the previous month. (2) The exchange of reserve notes between foreign banks was 1,553,949,681.35 yuan. (3) The exchange of reserve notes between Chinese banks (within the Silver Union Preparatory Committee) was 1,595,061,770.84 yuan, an increase of 184,417,805.98 yuan compared to the previous month. (4) The exchange of agency collection reserve notes was 1,948,645,048.9 yuan, an increase of 108,129,903.6 yuan compared to the previous month. (5) The exchange of reserve notes between native banks was 1,287,865,829.11 yuan, a decrease of 1,898,805.30 yuan compared to the previous month. Observing the aforementioned figures, it can be seen that, except for native banks, the bill exchange amount of other institutions in November increased compared to October, which is likely due to last month being the period for agricultural products to enter the market.

### Group A Oil Shops to Continue Sales Tomorrow

The Shanghai Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office and the Edible Oil Trade Wholesale Office, in order to eliminate private profiteering and ensure the supply of legitimate food consumers, with the permission of the military allocation authorities, are preparing to distribute sugar and oil based on a per capita basis. The specific measures have been drafted and will be implemented in the same manner as the authorities' per capita grain distribution method. It is reported that the per capita method will be based on the household registration books of the baojia system, and the Lianbao chiefs of each district will be asked to assist in the process. Each district will designate a number of registered retailers to sell sugar and oil. Residents will purchase based on "purchase certificates" issued in advance. Sugar and oil will be distributed once or several times per month. The quantity to be distributed per capita is still under discussion and research. An official announcement will be made and implemented after a complete decision is made and all preparations are completed. However, the date is expected to be in the spring of next year. If the per capita distribution system is implemented, queuing to press sugar and oil will become a historical relic.

Group A Leaders to Begin Sales Tomorrow

Before the implementation of per capita oil distribution, the Edible Oil Trade Wholesale Office will temporarily sell oil according to the previous free purchase system and will combine the city's 1,830 establishments into two groups, A and B. After the allocated ten-day oil supply for each group is sold out within the specified time limit, Group A has already sold out on the 25th of this month, and Group B will sell from the 26th until today. In order to continue selling edible oil to maintain the needs of the citizens, it has been decided to allocate another ten-day supply of oil to both Group A and Group B, totaling 10,300 piculs, to be sold out within five days.

Limit of One City Jin of Oil per Person

The retailers of Group A have already paid and collected the edible oil from the designated oil distribution agents yesterday. Sales will begin tomorrow (30th) and last until January 5th, except for New Year's Day, which is a holiday. The oil to be sold is soybean oil purchased from Dalian and self-extracted from local oil factories. The price is 7.10 yuan per city jin, including the barrel. The quantity is uniformly set at one city jin because the allocated quantity is sufficient and there is no need to further divide it into one city jin and half a city jin. Group B will begin sales after Group A is sold out, from January 6th to the 10th.

Eight Arrested for Altering Donation Tickets

Due to the shortage of sugar supply in this port, the authorities notified all shops to restrict purchases to those with donation tickets and house tickets from September and October. Unexpectedly, unscrupulous individuals forged house donation tickets and altered them. Hua An Sheng, residing at 58 Ningxing Street; Ye Chuanxin, residing at 47 Rue des Soeurs; Hu Heshang, residing at 61, Lane 74, Rue des Soeurs; Lu Rongtao, residing at 65, Lane 60, Rue de l'Est de la Centrale Electrique; Zhu Yangshi, residing at 45 Rue de l'Est de la Centrale Electrique; Shen Guanlin, residing at 52, Lane 74, Rue des Soeurs; Liu Caishi, residing at 51 Rue des Soeurs; and Li Yinglong, residing at 248 Route Tenant de la Tour; a total of eight individuals, altered old donation tickets to make them appear as September and October donation tickets in order to purchase sugar from various sugar shops. After being discovered, the above individuals were arrested and taken to the police station. Yesterday, they were brought before the First Criminal Division of the Second Special Court. The police lawyer presented the facts of the case and requested that the defendants be prosecuted for forgery and fraud. The defendants admitted to the alterations. The court ordered them to post bail and set a date for sentencing.

### Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama of the Japanese Army Press Department Promoted

Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama, head of the Shanghai Japanese Army Press Department, has been reassigned as a local unit commander. The order was issued on the 24th. Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama has been in office since June of this year, for about half a year, and has spared no effort in his press work in Shanghai, an important base during the Greater East Asia War. All parties expressed their regret at his promotion to another position.

### Economize to Help Students

Based on compassion, Mr. Shen Huangjun voluntarily economized and happily donated 1,000 yuan to the scholarship fund for readers of this newspaper yesterday. In addition, Miss Liu Tongyuan's daughter's one-month anniversary celebration resulted in a donation of 290 yuan from relatives and friends (Liu Facai 80 yuan, Liu Chuqing 80 yuan, Liu Linfu 40 yuan, Sheng Zhiheng 90 yuan). Additionally, He Yuqin contributed 47 yuan. The balance is 100,087.80 yuan, 0.12 jiao.

### Shanghai Market Prices: Wholesale and Retail Indices

The Customs Tariff Commission recently announced that the general wholesale price index for Shanghai in October of this year was 3043.85, an increase of 108.16 compared to 2935.69 in September. A comparison of the Shanghai retail price index from January to October of this year is provided below to show the changes in the prices of general consumer goods:

### Sino-Japanese Chamber of Commerce Strengthens Organization, Jointly Forms Economic Committee, Cooperates in Implementing New Price Control Measures

After the highest relevant authorities established a Price Control Bureau in Shanghai to implement price control measures, various relevant industrial and commercial organizations in this city have gradually fallen under the scope of control. In view of this, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Japanese Chamber of Commerce have jointly organized an Economic Committee to cooperate in the implementation of new price control measures.

Implementation Guidelines of the Economic Committee

It is understood that the implementation guidelines proposed by the Economic Committee are as follows: (1) Strengthen the organization and structure of various trade associations in the city to ensure that relevant industries and shops can join the associations to exert the power of control. (2) Discuss with the relevant authorities the issue of unblocking the sources of supplies and devise methods to allocate ships for transportation. (3) Closely cooperate with the association section under the Materials Control Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council, the Price Management Office of the French Municipal Council, and the price control agencies under the Municipal Government to comprehensively unify the price control mechanism. (4) Provide opinions to the relevant authorities on price review and price standards for consultation.

Strengthen Organization of Various Trade Associations

The Municipal Chamber of Commerce and other directly subordinate superior authorities have always attached great importance to the organization of various trade associations. If their organization is found to be lax or the personnel are inappropriate, measures must be taken to reorganize them and strengthen their activities. On the other hand, general shops are ordered to join the trade association of the relevant industry in order to unite and exert the power of control to assist the authorities in promoting price policies. It is found that there are approximately 368 trade associations in Shanghai, of which 149 are registered with the Chamber of Commerce. Currently, approximately 40 trade associations have been dissolved.

Registration Status of Various Trade Associations

Since its establishment, the association section under the Materials Control Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council has been progressing smoothly. Its motivation lies in contacting various trade associations to assist in controlling prices and allocating materials. Currently, most of the associations in the city have registered with the section. The remaining ones are required to complete the registration procedures within a limited time. After the registration is completed, in addition to making every effort to communicate between the authorities and various industries, the association section will accept the good-faith applications of various industries when they encounter difficulties, review them, and further guide the activities of various industries to enable officials and merchants to jointly seek solutions. The section also plans to maintain contact with various authorities to dredge supply sources and maintain the supply and fair distribution of materials.

Management Countermeasures Emphasize Key Points

The Price Control Countermeasures Committee is jointly organized by the city district authorities and Japanese official representatives in this city. Its basic goal is to strengthen the connection between the authorities, to make them fair and reasonable, and to strive to implement low-price policies for the sake of stabilizing people's livelihood, but on the condition that the smooth flow of materials is not hindered. In addition, management countermeasures are planned and implemented gradually, taking the principle of focusing on key points. The recent price limits on cotton yarn and cotton cloth are one of the best examples.

### Mechanic Suffocates While Trying to Test Car

Zhu Yaoqing, a mechanic, had been residing on Route Lafayette. He had been modifying a charcoal-powered car for a client. After the work was completed, he went to the client's garage last night to test the car. Presumably because of the cold weather, he first closed the door of the garage and then burned the charcoal. Soon after, his client arrived at the garage and found the door tightly closed. There was no response to knocking. He broke in and found the mechanic lying on the ground. He immediately asked someone to take him to a nearby hospital for emergency treatment, but he was already lifeless and soon passed away.

The mechanic died of asphyxiation from charcoal gas poisoning. Therefore, residents should pay attention to the dangers of such machines and be very careful to avoid accidents.

### Procedures for Population Moving in from Other Areas

The Baojia authorities of the two concessions have long had regulations regarding the movement of residents within their respective boundaries, which have been published. Whether moving out of the area, moving into the area, or moving within the area, it is necessary to complete the movement procedures and obtain a movement certificate, even for individual movements. Those who come from other areas and need to reside permanently in this port must also present a movement certificate. Those who do not have a movement certificate must present a county resident certificate or a residential identification card; otherwise, they will be refused registration in the household register and long-term residence within the area. Recently, those who have moved into this city from other areas have submitted other temporary proof documents for registration, such as those who have not yet received a county resident certificate in other areas, which makes the registration process difficult.

### Tax Collection on Cotton Yarn Based on Price to Be Implemented Starting Next Year; Procedures Ready, Generally 5% to Be Collected

Regarding the unified tax on cotton yarn and direct cotton yarn woven goods, the previous collection was based on a per dan unit. The Ministry of Finance submitted it to the Executive Yuan meeting, which was passed. Originally, it was scheduled to start on November 26th of this year, and the unified tax on cotton yarn and direct cotton yarn woven goods was to be collected at a rate of 5% based on the official price limit. However, due to the rush in completing the procedures, a temporary announcement was made to postpone the implementation. It is now learned that the procedures for collecting the unified tax have been prepared, and the implementation of collecting based on price will start on January 1st of next year. It is reported that the Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance has issued instructions to all its affiliated tax agencies to comply.

### Many Applicants for Design of Shanghai Municipal Council Seal

Deadline February 27th Next Year

According to a reporter from the Shanghai Evening Post this morning (28th), there are many applicants for the design of the Shanghai Municipal Council emblem. However, the exact number of applicants has not been disclosed. It is said that since the solicitation began on December 11th, it has been very enthusiastic. According to a Municipal Council spokesperson, in accordance with the original solicitation rules, the names of the applicants will not be disclosed before the announcement. After the deadline of February 27th, all evaluated entries will be made public. This emblem must be suitable for use as the central seal of the Shanghai International Settlement flag, not exceeding an area of 1 and 7/8 inches square. When submitting the proposed design, a drawing enlarged six times the size of the entire seal should be attached on a hard white paper measuring 27 inches long and 19 inches wide, drawn in pencil or ink. Each applicant should attach a sealed plain envelope with each submitted seal, indicating their pseudonym on the outside and their name and address inside.

### Talk on Naval Warfare

Vice Admiral of Naval Shipbuilding Kiyoshi Nagamura

Former Principal of Tokyo Higher Mercantile Marine School Kunihiko Sugawa

Reporter of Asahi Weekly

Translated from Asahi Weekly, December 27th

Also, during the last Great War, they did not build the ships completely from beginning to end in one shipyard; instead, they divided them into many small parts and gave them to factories that were not specialized in shipbuilding. For example, they gave one part to a box-making factory and another part to an iron factory. In this way, factories that were not originally shipbuilding factories were also included and called shipyards. They originally adopted that system, so they will probably adopt that system again this time.

Reporter: To what extent has shipbuilding technology advanced?

Nagamura: It's quite good! Although I don't know the exact situation, let's take the 35,000-ton battleships as an example. On the first day the naval disarmament treaty was lifted, Britain started building the Prince of Wales and King George V. The United States started building the Washington and North Carolina six to ten months later. However, they completed them six months earlier than Britain. Therefore, it cannot be said that their shipbuilding technology is not good; on the contrary, it must be recognized that they have considerable capabilities.

Reporter: Then Japan must make great efforts!

Nagamura: One is planned shipbuilding. That is, deciding on a standard type is very good. Until now, we have been building arbitrarily, so it will take considerable time to get on the right track. However, it is not enough to just shout "Effort, effort!" We must get on the right track as soon as possible. The so-called planned shipbuilding matter was announced in the newspaper several months ago, and then I heard the Prime Minister say on the radio that shipbuilding is the most important thing and that the people must cooperate. The next day, people from the newspaper came to me and asked how the people should cooperate. I replied that they should buy national bonds. Furthermore, if you are confident that your physical strength is sufficient, then go to the shipyard and swing the hammer to rivet. After telling him this, he nodded and said, "That's right," and then left.

The Bitter Experience of the Russo-Japanese War

Reporter: Although Japan's shipbuilding workers can be boasted of to the world, there is still a need to cultivate more.

Nagamura: Regarding the construction of merchant ships, I don't know much. However, as for the construction of warships, I believe that we are indeed not inferior to any country in the world. How did we develop to this point? During the Russo-Japanese War, in the third month after the start of the war, we lost two battleships in one day, namely the Hatsuse and the Yashima, so we had to find a way to replenish them. Because the loss of those two ships greatly weakened our strength. At that time, the Navy Department felt that we had to build them ourselves, no matter what. We could not entrust them to foreign countries. Therefore, it was decided to hand them over to the Kure (Japanese naval port name) warship construction site to build. After various studies, in order to suit the shipbuilding capabilities at that time, it was proposed to first build the simplest warships and then build solid warships. Thus, the Tsukuba and Ikoma were started. By the time those two ships were completed, the Russo-Japanese War had already ended. However, the completion of those two ships, needless to say, had great practical significance. After the war ended, a revolution occurred in construction due to the lessons of the war. One was the establishment of a policy of using domestic products to build domestically. As a result, I believe it was the main reason for promoting shipbuilding technology. Building with domestic products, this phrase may not make much sense now. Now there are such beautiful economic terms as "National Defense National Construction." However, people in the Meiji era were not good at using such descriptions. After making the determination to use domestic products to build domestically, we proceeded according to that policy. Therefore, during the last World War, I was a supervisor in England, and I rarely encountered things related to shipbuilding. In other words, there were no orders placed with foreign countries at that time. So I was idle every day. This can be said to be due to the progress of shipbuilding technology in Japan. Because of the progress in the country, I had nothing to do. Therefore, from that time on, Japan's shipbuilding technology has made considerable progress.

To build with domestic products, the entire industry must be developed. In warships, everything that ordinary people consider industrial products is gathered. There are railways and streetcars. As a result of its development, Japan was able to wage war. However, we cannot rest assured with this. We must know that other people are also working hard on research. According to people who often travel to Germany, things invented in Japan cannot be used by Japan, but Germany uses them to make great contributions. There are such things.

Furthermore, Japan builds warships for the purpose of war, that is, what we build are warships for combat. However, foreign warships are not necessarily so. Some are regarded as warships for defending colonies, so they are built for the purpose of facilitating the lives of those who go to the colonies. There are many warships built in this way. Therefore, even now that the war has arrived, the importance of training is still being shouted repeatedly.

Reporter: Does this apply to merchant ships as well?

Nagamura: Of course! (To be continued)

### China Philanthropic Children's Association Makes and Distributes Winter Clothing for Poor Children

The Shanghai China Philanthropic Children's Association initiated a fundraising campaign to collect winter clothing for poor children throughout the city and has raised over 40,000 yuan in winter clothing donations. The association recently invited businesses to bid for the production of the first batch of 2,000 sets of winter clothing, divided into four types: A, B, C, and D. The Min Sheng Clothing Company won the bid, with an average price of 29.30 yuan per set, which will be completed in about two weeks. Currently, due to the increasingly cold weather, more than 100 poor families have applied for winter clothing for their children. The association has printed a "Request for Winter Clothing for Poor Children Form." Those who wish to apply for winter clothing for poor children can go directly to the association (Room 208, Chung Wai Building, Avenue Edward VII) to obtain the form, fill in the applicant's name, address, family situation, and the child's age and name, with certification from a legitimate professional or shop. After the association sends personnel to investigate and verify the information, the clothing will be distributed. In order to distribute the clothing widely, the association hopes that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will cooperate, pay attention to children in need of winter clothing at any time, and apply for them on their behalf.

### After Unified Purchase of Cotton, Standards for Adulteration with Water and Impurities Specified, Legal Standards for Water and Impurity Content Set, Cotton Collected Allocated to Yarn Factories for Spinning

In order to unify the purchase and allocation of cotton, the Central China Cotton Control Association has divided the six cotton-producing areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, organized cotton industry companies, and handled the unified cotton purchase matters. Now, the Shanghai Pudong, Nanjing, Changzhou, Taizhou, and Northern Jiangsu companies have all purchased cotton according to the specified price limits. The collected cotton will be put into the public treasury and allocated to various factories according to the number of spindles in Chinese and Japanese yarn factories to supplement the raw materials for increasing the production of yarn and cloth.

Fixed Standards for Adulteration with Water and Impurities

A reporter from the Shanghai News Agency learned from the cotton industry yesterday that the cotton purchase control authorities are determined to do their best to ban cotton adulteration with water and impurities. (1) The legal standard for domestic cotton is a water content of 11% and an impurity content of 0.5%. (2) The maximum limit for domestic cotton bought and sold in the market is a water content of 12% and an impurity content of 2%. (3) Domestic cotton with a water and impurity content exceeding the maximum limit is prohibited from being bought and sold. However, yellow cotton, red cotton, foot cotton, and waste cotton, which originally contain more impurities and are not suitable for sorting, are not subject to this restriction. (4) Those who intend to obtain illegal profits by adulterating cotton with water and impurities will be investigated and dealt with according to the law. (5) Those who purchase cotton with a water or impurity content exceeding the maximum limit will be suspended from use or resale. This year's cotton in Northern Jiangsu, Southern Jiangsu, Hangzhou, Ningbo, Nanjing, Shanghai, and the surrounding areas has been harvested in abundance. It is estimated that it will produce approximately 2 million piculs. Since the unified purchase, the results of the cotton collection have been quite good, so the cotton raw materials of various yarn factories have been supplied, and the factories are all prepared to open their spindles to increase production and maintain legitimate needs.

The Business of Various Cotton Ginning Factories is Extremely Developed

This year, cotton has been harvested in abundance in Shanghai, Pudong, Chuansha, Fengxian, Nanhui, Qingpu, Taicang, Changshu, Haimen, Qidong, Chongming, Nantong, and other places, at least 20% more than in previous years, with an output of 70% to 80%. Therefore, the business of flower clothing, shell flowers, and seeds in these areas is also quite prosperous. According to a reporter from the Commercial News Agency, the number of cotton ginning factories opened in the suburbs of this city and various towns in Pudong is more than in previous years, and the ginned seeds are used to extract cotton oil. Because the price of oil is soaring, the sales of cotton oil are also very active. As for the residue left after the cottonseeds are pressed for oil, it is used to make cottonseed cake, and the price this year is also high. Therefore, various cotton ginning factories have made huge profits this year.

### Shanghai West Baojia Committee to Investigate Residents Starting Today

The Shanghai West Baojia Guidance Committee previously launched an investigation of factories, shops, and households in the Shanghai West district in order to fairly share the Baojia expenses, divided into two types, A and B. It is learned that in order to make the Baojia expense sharing more precise, the committee recently resolved and passed a revision of the previously set items, dividing factories and shops into three classes: special A, B, and C, and dividing households into four types: special A, B, C, and D. The details are as follows: Factories with 50 or more employees are classified as special, those with 30 or more employees are classified as A, and those with fewer than 30 employees are classified as B. Shops with three-bay storefronts are classified as special, those with two-bay storefronts are classified as A, and those with single-bay storefronts are classified as B. Households renting three or more rooms are classified as special, those with two rooms are classified as A, those with one room are classified as B, and the poor are classified as C. Starting today, the committee will send personnel to conduct investigations with the Fang Gong Suo and Lianbao Office personnel. After completing the investigation within one week, the Baojia expenses to be allocated to each household per month will be determined. It is reported that the collection of these Baojia expenses will be handled by the Shanghai West Office of the Finance Bureau.

### MacTaggart Road Road Repairs, Vehicles Stop Traffic

Pedestrians Only Allowed from South to North

Due to the disrepair and depression of the road surface on MacTaggart Road in the Public Concession, from the Xin Zha Road intersection to Connaught Road, the Shanghai Municipal Council has ordered the Public Works Department to carry out large-scale repairs. Because the project is huge, vehicles are absolutely prohibited from traveling on this section of the road. Even pedestrians are only allowed to travel one way from south to north.

### Talks with Sub-District Chiefs at the Shanghai Clearing Area Office

In order to understand the actual situation in the clearing area and use it as a reference for future work, Wu, the director of the Shanghai Clearing Area Office, held a meeting with sub-district chiefs at the Nanhui Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall at 5:00 pm on the 25th of this month, exchanging opinions as much as possible, which was quite harmonious. At the meeting, Director Wu gave detailed instructions on the joint efforts of the military and civilians to unite and work hard to build the countryside, as well as the implementation of education. The meeting adjourned after more than an hour.

### Group Worship Held on New Year's Day

Time flies like an arrow, and the new year is approaching. The Municipal Government of this city and its affiliated agencies will be closed for one and a half days starting on the afternoon of December 31st, and will resume work as usual on the morning of the 2nd.

### A Respectful Announcement to Those Managing Commodity Control

— Tie Min

Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the prices of all commodities have soared. The reasons for this include hoarding and manipulation by unscrupulous merchants, as well as sharp increases due to a lack of supply. In Shanghai, this is especially evident in the prices of rice, flour, cotton cloth, and enamelware. Recently, the government authorities and friendly nations have paid attention to this issue, and the control of various commodities has been gradually implemented and is becoming increasingly strengthened. For example, the control of cotton purchases, the price limits on cotton yarn and cloth, and the rationing of rice, flour, sugar, and enamelware. Recently, the government has also established a Commodity Price Countermeasures Committee and a Commodity Price Management Committee, indicating that the control of various commodities is in full swing. I would like to offer the following advice to those engaged in this important political task regarding general control matters that should be noted.

(1) Sino-Japanese cooperation in commodity control is of great importance. At a time when various regions are being cleared and pacified, it is necessary to quickly establish contact with the military and political organs of friendly nations, or to request assistance, or to cooperate with them. In the past, some friendly nations acted independently. More recently, the Central China Cotton Control Association and the Hangzhou Yarn and Cloth Rationing Association have both cooperated, which is a good example to follow.

(2) Government and the people should cooperate as one. The current economic control system is mostly based on the principle of cooperation between government and the people. This means that the government first establishes a general outline for the production, distribution, and consumption of commodities, and then the people operate it autonomously. Following this model, the current control associations in Japan are all organized by the people, and the government delegates a portion of its authority to the control associations. This is tantamount to the people controlling themselves, which is more effective than control by government agencies.

(3) Purchase prices must be appropriate. The purchase of commodities by control organizations is also an indispensable part of a controlled economy. However, the purchase prices must be carefully considered, and a unified original cost calculation system must be adopted. The cost of production must be calculated in detail in order to avoid the drawbacks of prices being too high or too low, and to arrive at appropriate prices. Furthermore, the livelihood of farmers must be given the utmost consideration. A family of eight depends on this for their livelihood, so the living expenses of farmers must be fully taken into account.

(4) In-kind distribution must be fair. Once commodities have been purchased, they must be distributed to the people according to their needs. However, the distribution prices must be kept as low as possible, and they must be sufficient and fair. For example, the current system of grain distribution per capita and the price limits on enamelware in Shanghai are indeed very fair, but in reality, it is still difficult to achieve sufficiency and universality, which has led to the undesirable phenomena of panic buying and black markets. This drawback must be eliminated in the future.

(5) Control plans must emphasize production. Commodity control often only focuses on distribution and consumption, while neglecting production. Therefore, the government must emphasize production when establishing a general outline for control. This means considering how to strengthen the production of certain commodities, such as improving planting methods, eliminating diseases, developing wasteland, and encouraging investment.

The above are just five points, which are the most important aspects of commodity control. Other aspects, such as ensuring that the organization of control agencies is systematic and well-organized, and that service personnel eliminate bureaucratic habits and provide convenience to the people in all aspects, should also not be taken lightly.

### Cotton Cloth Sales Quotes Higher, Especially for Dong Bu

Factory Cloth: Yesterday's market was active with street sales, and goods remained tight. Sales quotes in various markets were again raised, but there were not many transactions. 16-pound Earth brand coarse cloth was 290 yuan, 14-pound Earth was 245 yuan, 9-pound New Character was 145 yuan, 8-pound Zhenzhong was 140 yuan, 12-pound Earth brand fine cloth was 196 yuan. The same poundage of Dapeng Fugui was also quoted at 195 to 196 yuan, an increase of about 1.5 yuan compared to last week. Peach Blossom Lady Lin was transacted at 317.5 yuan in the morning and 319 yuan in the afternoon.

Dong Bu: Market sentiment was high again. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth opened at 200.5 yuan, and Trumpet Five Blessings fine cloth was also priced at around 200 yuan. Four Gentlemen broadcloth opened at 8 yuan for red orders, fell back to 7.93 yuan, but at noon closing, demand exceeded supply, and transactions were made at 8.05 yuan, an increase of 0.11 yuan.

### Long-Haired Velvet is Slow-Moving, While Light-Weight Woolens and Cashmeres are All Popular

Woolen and cashmere shipping orders were not yet resolved yesterday. Generally, those eager to deliver goods are taking risks in transportation. Prices remain ostensibly stable but secretly strong. However, women's colored long-haired velvet has seen a recent slowdown in sales. Due to its excessive popularity, noble women are avoiding it. Also, the popularity of making leather coats is another reason for the slow sales of long-haired velvet.

Light-weight woolens and cashmeres are currently difficult to obtain due to the high cost and scarcity of raw materials, resulting in all of them being popular. The outlook is still bullish. (1) Flannel, regardless of Western suits or Chinese clothing, is in short supply and prices are firm. Internal and external warehouses and stores are lacking inventory. Goods imported from the East and West are also gradually becoming scarce. The local factory's supply is insufficient to meet demand, and the colors are scarce. Popular Chinese clothing flannel has more retail and speculative activity, and its price increase is naturally more intense than that of pullover Western suit flannel. (2) Water-repellent woolen fabric: Imported goods have long been sold out. Currently, most of the circulating transactions are textiles from Shanghai. However, due to recent restrictions, they are also scarce. Plain colors are selling briskly. Most of the items on the market are only dark blue in color. It is reported that grass green dye has been discontinued and cannot be produced. (3) Viyella: Recently, the amount of this product on the market, whether striped or plain, has decreased compared to the previous month. Due to limited production, most of the old stock has been snapped up by people inside and outside the industry. (4) Serge: White serge has attracted attention and is sought after, with prices rising and goods scarce. Grass green is second. Other thick and thin serge are also becoming scarce, and light-weight goods often exceed the price limit. (5) Tricotine: Black and white are both lacking. Black tricotine is still available for sale, but white tricotine is difficult to find. It is reported that white raw materials must be clean and snow-white, and the supply of毛條 is about to be cut off, so general factories will feel difficult to produce. (6) Flannel: Because it cannot be spun and woven from wool scraps and shredded velvet, its production is also small. Goods are scarce and prices are expensive. Yesterday, diagonal-patterned bottoms were priced at 300 yuan per yard, plate four bottoms were 250 to 260 yuan, and factory goods were 120 yuan to 160 yuan. (7) Palisi, Yusha woolen fabric, and Wanliding, etc., have limited old stock and most of the new products are lacking. Those with capital inside and outside the industry have successively absorbed a lot of them, resulting in a sharp rise in prices, which is the top among woolen and cashmere stores in the past ten days. (8) "Fatty" cotton is extremely scarce and prices are rising. There are prices but no goods for Fo Ye Lai. Dan Limeng are secretly firm. Dark blue is more active than other colors. The Guanghuo style of plate four woolen fabric is pretty. Wool goods are stable and flat. The colors of women's cheongsam woolen fabric are completely subject to temporary changes depending on the color.

### Gold Jewelry Listing Price Unchanged, Discount Rate Reduced by Two Fen Again

Yesterday, the listed price of gold jewelry in the city's jewelry stores was still 3,050 yuan per tael, unchanged (the purchase price was reduced by about 300 yuan). The informal market price among the same industry, due to the approaching end of the year, was in demand but without supply, and the price was slightly lower at 1,770 to 1,780 yuan. The listed price of silver ornaments was still 16 yuan per tael, and the inter-industry price was around 17 yuan.

Yesterday morning, the discount rate of the Money Trade Association was 1.8 fen, reduced by another 0.2 fen.

### Joint Banknotes Approaching the Four Yuan Mark

Yesterday, the inter-industry price of military notes was 5.5535 yuan. The price for small money houses and banks was 5.56 yuan and 5.545 yuan. Joint Reserve Bank notes suddenly saw a sharp decline to within 4 yuan, with buying and selling prices at 3.88 yuan and 3.89 yuan.

### 73 Member Money Houses

The number of newly established joint-stock company money houses in the city has been increasing recently. According to the Money Trade Association's Money House (i.e., remittance house), there were a total of 50 companies listed in the first month of the lunar calendar this year. As of recently, it has increased to 73 companies. The full list is explored and recorded below: Da Lai, Yuan Sheng, Wu Feng, Ren Chang, Zheng Tai, An Kang, An Yu, Cun De, Tong Run, Jun Chang, Jun Tai, Cheng Yu, Yi Da, Xin Fu, Xin Yu, Chun Yuan, Zhi Xiang, Shun Kang, Hui Chang, Yi Chang, Yi Long, Fu Kang, Fu Yuan, Geng Yu, Zi Lan, Qing Da, Qing Cheng, Ding Kang, Zheng Xiang, Heng Jiu, Heng Tong, Bao Feng, Fu Li, Jin Yuan, Xin He, Yi He, Qi Chang, Yong Long, Xin Zhong, Shen De, Dun Yu, Jia Chang, Shi Chang, Tai Lai, Tong Kang, Zi Kang, Cun Cheng, Hui Da, Ju Kang, Tian Yi, Feng Yu, Yuan Heng, Run Yuan, Yuan Lai, An Tai, Zhen Tai, Yi Da, Fu Hua, Rui Xiang, Heng Yuan, Kai Tai, Qi Xin, Ding Feng, Yuan Chang, Ju Feng, Chun Yuan, Cheng Feng, Li Cheng, Hong Da, Tian Cheng, Xin Da, De Fu, Yuan Xiang.

### Small Volume of Chinese Stocks Traded During the Holiday

Yesterday, the Chinese stock market was in the midst of the New Year holiday, and the same industry was winding down. However, a small number of stock companies accepted client entrustments to buy and sell, resulting in a hidden market. Amid the sparse trading, the bid and ask prices differed greatly. Some investors wanted to buy but couldn't find any sellers, while others wanted to sell but lacked buyers. There were no official market prices, and the trend was mostly weak. Those seeking cash sales were more active. The market prices of those with transactions are recorded below:

### Newly Arrived Broad Beans to Be Distributed Within Days

The source of miscellaneous grains is still scarce, and retail sales are not sluggish, so the market trend remains firm and unchanged. Yesterday, 20 packages of Chongming New Sand Red opened at 350 yuan, and 15 packages of New Sand Yellow opened at 230 yuan. 4,000 packages of Jiading White Silkworm opened at 275 yuan. Three trucks of Fat Character Bean Cake opened at 84 yuan to 85 yuan, and five trucks of Yuan Long Bean Cake opened at 84 yuan to 85 yuan.

Also, according to reports, the Miscellaneous Grain Group recently received 500 tons (10,000 packages) of broad beans, which will be distributed within days. The allocation price per担 is 46.5 yuan in military notes.

### Increased Sugar Allocation, Amount Undetermined

This month's sugar is intended to meet the needs of the Lunar New Year holiday, so sales are bound to increase. Retailers have requested an additional allocation of 10,000 packages, but no decision has been made yet. As for the per capita sugar rationing, it will not be implemented for the time being. It is found that there is still a lot of sugar in storage, so even if there is no continued arrival, there will be no shortage.

### Kelp is Popular, Shredded Kelp is Sluggish

Kelp is scarce due to the lack of arrivals and sparse inventory, so even though it is a common commodity, the price increase is not dull. At the end of last month, it was only 500 yuan, but now it has risen to 720 yuan. Yesterday's market was even higher at 480 yuan. Shredded kelp is originally the same product, but because there is little demand, it has been sluggish for a long time, selling at only one-tenth of the price, and still few are willing to take it.

### Basket-Packed Longan Restored

Basket-packed miscellaneous longan continued to be offered on the market yesterday. Because the goods were relatively common and had broken shells, the traders' buying price was not high. A batch was immediately offered, and the price of those with uneven particles had broken through the 900 yuan mark. It is heard that another batch is packed and on the way, so the trend is soft and flat.

### Almonds and Straw Mushrooms Have Weak Arrivals and Sales

The almond market is mediocre. Currently, white jade almonds are priced at 2,700 to 2,800 yuan, North Mountain almonds are priced at 1,400 to 1,500 yuan, Dragon King almonds are priced at 2,000 yuan, and Kuang almonds are priced at 2,000 yuan. Straw mushrooms are in short supply and sales are weak. The market price is still stable. Zisheng is priced at 15,000 yuan, and Li Baqi is priced at 9,000 yuan.

### White Lead Wire is Short and Seeing Price Increases

Yesterday, the market for coarse and fine white lead wire saw a slight increase in inquiries from merchants, and demand from manufacturers and scattered users also showed signs of stirring. Therefore, the long-silent white lead market began to unfold yesterday. However, the inventory of this product in Shanghai is short, and it is difficult to find a full range of coarse and fine colors. It is also difficult to source. At the same time, holders of goods, due to the shortage of spot goods, the standard pace saw an upward trend. Currently, the market price is around 1,000 yuan per担, and holders are reluctant to easily sell their inventory, so buyers are running around and it is still difficult to recruit. The biggest reason is that the inventory of hardware products in Shanghai is very short.

### Little Change in Cigarettes

The cigarette market is stable as usual. There has been very little speculative news recently, and with the approach of the end of the year, actual sales are light, so off-site trading has been very quiet. As for the Guild market that has been closed until now, it may resume business soon. In the future, when entering the market for transactions, it is necessary to abide by the rules. As long as the factory continues to supply goods without interruption, hoarders will inevitably disappear on their own, and the selling price can be stabilized. Therefore, observing the future market, it is unlikely to continue to rise. Yesterday's market prices were: Great British brand, 9,350 yuan; Old Knife brand, 8,300 yuan; Pinhai brand, 7,500 yuan; Fairy brand, 7,250 yuan; Five Hua brand, 6,000 yuan; Japanese cigarette Golden Spear brand, 2,800 yuan; Jin Dalou, 3,200 yuan; Red Rose, 2,600 yuan; Quanlu brand, 2,900 yuan; Guide brand, 2,400 yuan; National cigarette Pyramid, 6,400 yuan; Beautiful brand, 5,600 yuan; Golden Mouse brand, 3,790 yuan; Platinum Dragon, 3,850 yuan, with no changes compared to the weekend.

### Prices of Daily Necessities Remain Stable

The market for daily necessities is quite quiet, and prices remain stable. Phoenix matches sell for 3,000 yuan, Beautiful 3,200 yuan, Golden Ding 2,800 yuan, miscellaneous brands 2,350 yuan, Gu Ben soap 515 yuan, Bai Xiangmao 480 yuan, Huang Xiangmao 415 yuan, Bai Lishi 洋燭 420 yuan, 儈帽 360 yuan, miscellaneous brands 250 yuan.

### Qualifications

— Jia Sheng

At a banquet, I encountered a few young men with slicked-back hair, shiny faces, and impeccably tailored suits. After a few rounds of drinks, one of the suit-clad young men, filled with self-importance, began to inquire about the qualifications of those around him.

"My friend, are you from Columbia?"

"Yes! Yes!"

"My friend, are you from Harvard?"

"No, I'm from Yale."

"..."

The fathers and elder brothers of these suit-clad young men had served as officials, warlords, compradors, or landlords. From a young age, they had studied at domestic mission schools. Their current qualifications included doctorates, master's degrees, and bachelor's degrees.

What was the true academic level of these doctoral, master's, and bachelor's degree holders? How much money did they spend studying abroad? After returning to China, what contributions had they made to the country and society? We don't have time to research these questions.

What we are researching is, if the fathers and elder brothers of these young men were not officials, warlords, compradors, or landlords, but were commoners or the poor, could these young men have obtained doctorates, master's degrees, and bachelor's degrees? I think, in this era of commodification, these young men would probably have graduated from elementary school or middle school at most, and would have long been forced by economic circumstances to make a living in society and earn money to support their families! Fortunately, their fathers and elder brothers had money. That is why they were able to obtain qualifications such as doctorates. Therefore, I suddenly realized:

"The *zi* in *zige* (qualification) contains the meaning of *ziben* (capital). Only by investing capital can one obtain qualifications. Invest a share of capital, and obtain a share of qualification. Without capital, forget about obtaining qualifications."

Don't the enrollment brochures for domestic elementary and middle schools also clearly state in black and white: Enrollment is only granted after tuition fees are paid? The children of ordinary people don't even have the capital to attend elementary school, so what are we talking about doctorates, master's degrees, and bachelor's degrees?

Doctorates, master's degrees, bachelor's degrees, and other qualifications have already been wholesale purchased or reserved by the sons of wealthy families with capital. At the same time, the hiring standards of various institutions and companies in society are based on the level of qualifications. Therefore, the sons of wealthy families are destined to be doctors, masters, and bachelors from the womb. And at the same time, they are destined to be senior staff or directors, managers. Qualifications, qualifications, the capital of the fathers and elder brothers has already determined the qualifications and fate of the children.

Perhaps some people will say that there are also doctors, masters, and bachelors in society who come from humble backgrounds; as long as they are willing to work hard, it is not difficult to obtain scholarships or government-funded studies abroad.

Indeed, there are such cases, but the proportion of opportunities is too small. Let those who have already obtained them or those who are trying to obtain them report on the difficulties of obtaining them.

### The Role of Money

— E Sheng

Mankind has three functions regarding the role of money: making money, saving money, and using money. These three functions are forcibly separated for the sake of reasoning. In reality, they are very closely linked and are the keys to the three major gates in our economic society.

Regarding making money: If a person is solely focused on pursuing money and wealth, regardless of integrity and shame, and without distinguishing between right and wrong, this type of person is considered the most hateful and pitiful person in the world. We might as well call them "money mad." However, "ill-gotten gains" will still be "ill-spent." Even if they themselves are not harmed, they will sooner or later cause trouble for their descendants.

Regarding saving money: Saving money is recognized as a virtue because it indirectly allows social consumption to enter a normal state. At the same time, it can also collect the savings of many people and use them to increase the activity of the entire economic society. It can directly benefit individuals, so-called preparing for a rainy day, so that in case of emergency, one does not have to beg others.

Regarding using money: The prerequisite for using money is to understand the meaning of money itself, so that one can avoid "waste" and focus on "consumption." In other words, although money is a medium for exchanging goods, the method of exchanging for goods and the means of using goods should be considered in terms of satisfying one's own desires without harming society.

Among the above three functions, as long as one of them causes a ripple in the economic society, human society will be shocked and even shaken. For example, the stealing and fraud of thieves and thugs are abnormal means of making money; the miser's greed for money and unwillingness to engage in public welfare are abnormal means of saving money; the prodigal son's spending money like dirt is an abnormal means of using money.

### Spitoon

— Ji Xiao Shang

Once, my maternal uncle and I were waiting for a train at the station. Bored, we chatted and laughed aimlessly to pass the time.

My maternal uncle suddenly asked me, "What is a spitoon?"

I said, "It is a container for people to spit phlegm into, called a spitoon."

My maternal uncle then asked, "Suppose a spitoon, from the time it is manufactured in the factory until it is destroyed, has never held a mouthful of phlegm, is it still considered a spitoon?"

Without thinking, I replied, "It is ultimately a spitoon."

My maternal uncle smiled and said, "It is really not a spitoon!"

I thought about it carefully and realized that my maternal uncle was right. It really cannot be considered a spitoon. I am ultimately too stupid.

The train arrived, and we parted ways, unable to continue the conversation. However, whenever I think of that conversation, I feel a jolt of alarm in my heart.

Therefore, I often ask myself inwardly, "Although I have the form of a 'person,' do I possess the conditions to be a 'person'? Am I a 'person,' a dignified and upright 'person'?"

### A Social Ailment: Playing Mahjong

— Da Guan

The most valuable aspect of good governance in ancient times was "changing customs and habits." Wen Weng's governance of Shu in the Han Dynasty was able to transform customs and people's hearts for the better, so he was called a meritorious official, because the effect of "changing customs and habits" is to cure social ills and make society sound. But how easy is it to do?

The deepest and most widespread social ailment today is playing mahjong. Regardless of wealth, gender, or social class, most people consider playing a few rounds of mahjong as their daily work. If you try walking through the alleys at night, you can't help but hear the clatter of tiles. It has become so common that no one finds it strange, which shows that there are countless people addicted to it. Last year, I wanted to find a legitimate form of entertainment, so I wanted to buy a set of Go stones to play. I went to the City God Temple market and searched several shops, but I couldn't find a set of Go stones. However, there were at least a hundred or so shops selling mahjong tiles, and the prices were very expensive. This shows how much society needs this kind of thing.

People in society should be diligent in their careers. Let's not even mention the fact that mahjong is actively harmful to one's career. Speaking of the advantages and disadvantages of mahjong itself, those who love to play mahjong think it is a kind of entertainment that can relieve boredom and dispel worries. If it is done occasionally, it is harmless, but if you constantly engage in this activity, over time, regardless of winning or losing, the consumption of things like cigarettes, snacks, and simple meals in this gambling game... isn't it paid for by the people in the game? In that case, the money will only go out and not come in, and the people involved should understand that very well.

Especially when the luck isn't good, it is a really bad time, causing endless complaints. A certain poet wrote a self-repentant poem about playing mahjong, with the line: "Seeking pleasure invites strange numerical misfortunes, passing time turns into worrying about missed opportunities." If you carefully savor these two lines, you will find that so-called "entertainment" is simply asking for trouble, and so-called "passing time" and "relieving worries" actually turn into烦恼. What's the point? Is there really no other fun to be found besides this damn thing? These people who play mahjong must have learned many lessons from their experiences, and they are not all muddleheaded. The fact that they are addicted to it and don't regret it is really because the root of the social illness is too deep, and they are so tightly bound by the environment that it is difficult to break free.

This is a social illness, and the entire society must be cured. The methods of treatment are: (1) Use collective power to prohibit it, and if there are repeat offenders, do not hesitate to punish them by law. (2) Use educational methods to influence them and make them thoroughly aware, and special attention should be paid to social education. At the same time, promote legitimate entertainment to bring those with leisure time back on track. If this widespread social ailment is not eradicated, we will see the disease spread wider and deeper, and everyone will be dissolute in gambling, and not diligent in their careers. Inevitably, the society's economy will gradually decline, and morality will also gradually decline. Isn't this a hidden worry for the future of the nation?

### Self-Confidence

— Hai Lin

The worst thing in the world is not trusting yourself; losing self-confidence is losing your most precious asset.

The morality of success is built on self-confidence; failures often happen because people don't trust their own strength. They turn back as soon as they encounter a wall, not knowing that developing self-confidence is something that involves setbacks.

Some people only hope for self-confidence, but don't build it. Building self-confidence is a task that cannot be stopped for a moment. You should carefully consider each thing you do, and then immediately strengthen your self-confidence and move forward bravely. If you abandon self-confidence, your work will immediately fail, without a doubt.

To build self-confidence, we must make sure that today's work is a step further than yesterday's, and at the same time, we can see our mistakes and correct them every day. In that case, we will be progressing every day, cultivating a lively and energetic life.

One step ahead of building self-confidence is thought. We must build new ideas and plans every day to make our self-confidence stronger and more solid.

These cornerstones on the road to success are daily work. At the same time, please remember that people without self-confidence are the worst people.

### After Seeing "Begonia" — The Crystallization of Six Artists

— Zhu Feng

After seeing "Begonia" and walking out of the Carlton, a feeling welled up in my heart. I felt that what I saw tonight was not a play, but a magnificent, elegant, and profound story painting. And this was not painted with colors; the paint used was brainpower and effort, provided by six artists: the original author Qin Shouou, the directors Fei Mu, Zuo Lin, Gu Zhongyi, and the actors Shi Hui and Shen Min.

For the convenience of the performance and the need to consider time and location limitations, etc., the script certainly cannot completely follow the novel. Every novel adapted into a script will have some changes. For example, in the novel, Begonia's death is a suicide by jumping off a building, but on stage, it is portrayed as dying of exhaustion and illness in the backstage of a Beijing opera theater. This is purely because suicide by jumping off a building is too monotonous and not easy to perform well, so it was changed. At the same time, dying backstage can also be more lively. But on the whole, the script is indeed very faithful to the original work.

The three directors, Fei Mu, Zuo Lin, and Gu Zhongyi, are all seasoned veterans of the spoken drama world, and they handled the entire play brilliantly, with only one or two transitions being a bit stiff. The two actors, Shi Hui and Shen Min, can truly be said to be flawless. Their acting skills have simply reached a state of perfection.

If I had to nitpick, it would only be Begonia's makeup in the fifth act. The full head of white hair and the wrinkles on the face seemed too old. At the same time, Zhao Yukun and Luo Xiangqi's makeup seemed too young. It would be better to change the white hair that Begonia wears to gray-white, which seems more reasonable.

### Sharing the Same Boat in Storms

— He Jia Zhi

One, Two, Later Garden Flower

After thinking this way, Wei Cheng didn't even dare to go home. In the dim light of dawn, pedestrians gradually appeared on the road. He thought about how last year today, he had rescued Sister Cuizhen from Fei Changhe's hands: Guofang was alone, taking a car from Shuangqiao to Shide Hall; at that time, although I had just suffered a great loss, I was still happy in my heart. Unexpectedly, only a year had passed, and it had changed to this point. While running, he unknowingly ran to the northern countryside of Shide Hall, to his uncle Li Youxie's rice mill, which appeared before him. He walked into the mill to find his uncle. Li Youxie was planning to enshrine the God of Wealth today and then sit high at the account table. When he saw Wei Cheng, he was overjoyed and said, "I was just about to send someone to pick you up, and you came. What's wrong? Your sleeve is bleeding?" Wei Cheng pulled Li Youxie into a room inside and said that he had gotten drunk last night and went to kill someone with Huang Long, but he didn't succeed in killing the person, and instead got injured himself. Li Youxie was surprised that Wei Cheng wasn't the kind of person who would kill, and questioned him further. Wei Cheng said, "I want to borrow your place to hide. If you still think of me as a relative, please don't even tell my aunt." Li Youxie was full of suspicion, not understanding what he was doing, and pressed him for an explanation. He just kept repeating those few sentences. Fortunately, the rice mill should stop work during the New Year, and will not resume until after the Lantern Festival. Li Youxie locked Wei Cheng in a deep room, and even moved the God of Wealth feast today to the residence on the east side.

Around noon, Second Madam Ye sent A Xing to ask if the young master had come. Li Youxie then asked A Xing what was going on. He didn't dare to tell A Xing that Wei Cheng was hiding here, and only comforted A Xing with a few words, saying, "Tell the Second Madam to rest assured. It must be that the two brothers lost money gambling first and fell asleep, feeling unwilling, and happily said that the brothers went to win back the money. It's nothing." After A Xing left, Li Youxie came to tell Wei Cheng, and saw Wei Cheng pulling cotton from the quilt and applying it to his arm. He tried to persuade Wei Cheng to go back, but Wei Cheng refused, and stayed for four or five days. Li Youxie was afraid that Second Madam Ye was worried, so he personally went to Shide Hall, and subtly revealed some news to Second Madam Ye in his tone, saying, "Wei Cheng is fine, you don't have to worry as his aunt. In a few days, he will naturally come back. If he doesn't come back, ask me, his uncle." (256)
