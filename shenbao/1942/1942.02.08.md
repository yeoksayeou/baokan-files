### The Current Situation in Hong Kong Under Japanese Occupation

Haitong News Agency Hong Kong Correspondent: Luo Jiasi, a reporter for Haitong News Agency, said that two days after the complete surrender of the British army, the lights were turned on again in several places in Kowloon. There must be a large number of well-trained technicians in the Japanese army engaged in restoration work. For example, the Hong Kong radio station was immediately repaired and has resumed broadcasting since January 4. Water pipes damaged by bombs are being repaired as quickly as possible. Other facilities such as gas and electricity were restored in the shortest possible time. At the same time, a rescue ship arrived in Hong Kong to salvage small ships sunk by the British army. Harbor traffic is very inconvenient due to the lack of ferries, as all ferries were destroyed by the British army. Regarding this matter, the Japanese army is implementing various temporary measures to maintain traffic between Hong Kong and Kowloon. Signal posts in the port have been re-established. The naval dockyard was severely damaged, so it is being repaired. A large number of Japanese cargo ships are busy unloading goods. The famous Kowloon Wharf is like a beehive. Hong Kong workers will not have to worry about finding work. Public buses in Kowloon also resumed operation after a few days, and the fares are as cheap as before. After the surrender of Hong Kong, the Japanese commander declared that enemy nationals would be given freedom for ten days. When we were walking on the streets of Hong Kong, we were surprised to see British and Scottish people from the British army still wearing their uniforms, shopping or doing other tasks. Police officers were busy taking over hotels or standing idle on the streets, as if the terrible scene had not happened in Hong Kong. During this period, the Japanese army gave the enemy army the opportunity to take care of private affairs. Several senior police officers even rode around in cars, and the Japanese army did not interfere. Subsequently, all enemy troops were ordered to gather at the Moraine parade ground and were assigned to temporary detention camps. These temporary detention camps were mostly Chinese hotels requisitioned by the Japanese army. The food for those detained was taken care of by the Japanese authorities. Those detained were free to talk when visited, and some were even specially allowed to go shopping or take care of private affairs on the street. The Japanese army gave special treatment to Irish people in the British army, whether they were from Northern Ireland or the Irish Free State. Even today, there are still British people walking on the streets, and some British people have the opportunity to be employed by the Japanese. Regarding the protection of private property, the Japanese authorities also took into consideration the property of British and Americans, and their cars were allowed to be used. Therefore, enemy nationals are not dissatisfied with the treatment given by the Japanese army after the end of the war. Dutch people in Hong Kong were also detained by the Japanese army. The Japanese side also considered the treatment of the Hong Kong Volunteer Defence Corps. At the beginning of the war, the Hong Kong Volunteer Defence Corps had been reorganized into a regular army, and its members had all sworn to join the army. Even so, the Japanese army still released many members of the Volunteer Defence Corps from the detention camps. Cinemas and Chinese theaters have also reopened, but only Japanese plays are allowed to be performed. The police have also resumed their duties. The Japanese authorities took over the Chinese and Indian police from the former Hong Kong Police Station and ordered them to manage traffic and patrol. The Japanese army's lenient treatment of enemy nationals is surprising. The Japanese army declared at the beginning of the war that the war was not a war between individuals, so they did not hate ordinary people of enemy countries. Unfortunately, at the beginning of the war, the British government of Hong Kong detained the Japanese people in Hong Kong in Stanley Prison and ordered them to hand over their cash without giving receipts. Therefore, the treatment of the detained Japanese people was very harsh. Three days later, they did not even have tea to drink. Four days before the surrender of Hong Kong, there was even no salt in their food. In addition, five days after being detained, they were not allowed to walk in the prison's square and had to curl up in prison for 24 hours a day. There was a military camp near Stanley Prison, and strong fortifications were set up, so there would be fierce fighting near the prison, endangering those detained. Hong Kong is an overpopulated city. The Japanese authorities sent a large number of Chinese residents back to their hometowns in the shortest possible time. A large number of people are still gathered outside the offices of various shipping companies, waiting to buy tickets to return to their hometowns, but there are not enough ships, which is a problem.

### New Turkish Ambassador to the UK Leaves for the UK to Take Office

### Establishment of the Pacific Supreme Military Council; UK and US Cooperate Fully; The Two Countries Also Establish a Joint Chiefs of Staff Headquarters to Be Responsible for Coordinating the Distribution of Military Supplies

Washington, 6th Dispatch from Havas: President Roosevelt told the press today that the Pacific Supreme Military Council has been established in Washington and London and began work last month. The British and American governments have been cooperating closely. The council brings together military and political leaders. The Dutch government and the British Dominions all participate. In addition, regional military councils similar to the Pacific Supreme Military Council will soon be established to ensure maximum unity between the various armies and their headquarters, it is said.

Washington, 7th Dispatch from Reuters: President Roosevelt will have lunch with Army Chief of Staff General Marshall and Navy Commander-in-Chief Admiral King this afternoon to discuss military affairs at will. According to an announcement from the U.S. Department of the Army, the United Kingdom and the United States have established a Joint Chiefs of Staff Association, which will be headquartered in Washington, D.C., to fully coordinate operational matters. The production and distribution of British and American military supplies, as well as the joint operations of Britain, the United States, and the Allied countries, are all under its jurisdiction. The personnel are as follows: On the American side, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Stark, Navy Commander-in-Chief Admiral King, Army Chief of Staff General Marshall, and Air Force Commander General Arnold. On the British side, former Army Chief of Staff Admiral Dill, Admiral Liddell, Lieutenant General Weems, and Air Marshal Harris. The headquarters of the Chiefs of Staff is located in Washington, but must contact Admiral Pound, Chief of the British Naval Staff, General Brooke, Chief of the British Army Staff, and Air Marshal Bader, Chief of the British Air Staff, at all times. Although all recommendations of the Chiefs of Staff must be submitted to the government authorities of each country, the Chiefs of Staff may take appropriate action when various issues require urgent handling to facilitate operations. Its authority is equivalent to that of a commander-in-chief jointly established by the British and American governments. All strategic planning and coordination of forces are under its control. If the matters discussed by the Chiefs of Staff are related to the interests of the Dutch East Indies, Australia, New Zealand, and other countries, representatives from those countries will participate. In addition to a secretary from the United States, the United Kingdom will also send Major General Taikes as secretary. Taikes is also the secretary of the British Imperial Defence Committee and the British War Cabinet to facilitate liaison.

Washington, 7th Dispatch from Reuters: The Department of the Army announced yesterday the establishment of a General Administration Office for the Distribution of Military Supplies, with Hopkins as the director and Major General Pence as the deputy director, to preside over the distribution of various military supplies to the Allied countries. The matters decided by it must be submitted to the Chiefs of Staff and forwarded to the British and American government authorities for approval.

Washington, 7th Dispatch from Reuters: British people in Washington unanimously welcomed the establishment of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Conference between the United States and the United Kingdom, believing that this is a sign of further cooperation between the two countries to resist the Axis powers. The production and distribution of British and American military supplies are also on the agenda of the conference. The governments of the British Dominions can consult with the Chiefs of Staff Conference on urgent issues related to the governments of the various Dominions. All of this can produce significant results. The U.S. President's announcement that the Pacific War Council has been established in London and Washington for a month, followed by the U.S. Department of the Army's announcement of the establishment of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Conference, proves that democratic countries have quickly taken the necessary measures, it is said.

Washington, 6th Dispatch from Havas: The House Appropriations Committee has submitted a report to the House of Representatives, requesting the House to allocate US$10 million for air defense expenses, which is expected, but cannot be applied to the United States in the same way as large-scale bombing of Britain or the European continent. The government authorities have requested an appropriation of US$600 million for various defense expenses, of which this is one part, it is said.

### Hungarian Parliament Will Discuss the Selection of the Regent's Successor

Bern, 7th Dispatch from Havas: The Hungarian Parliament is about to reconvene, and it is not known whether the issue of selecting a successor to Regent Admiral Horthy will be raised for discussion. Since the admiral took office as Regent in March 1920, he has made outstanding achievements, but he is now 74 years old and old, so he must find a replacement as soon as possible. In addition, since the outbreak of the war, all the territories lost by Hungary in the last European war, except for Croatia, which declared independence, have been gradually restored. Since the territory has been restored to its old appearance, its international status has naturally been raised. Therefore, the long-pending issue of the throne has also arisen recently. It is said that there are about three people in the world who can inherit the Hungarian throne. One is Duke Spoleto, who was recently crowned King of Croatia, but his possibility is very small. The second is Archduke Otto of the Habsburg Imperial Family, but his public opinion is not good in the eyes of Hungary's friendly countries, and it seems difficult for him to succeed. The third is Archduke Albrecht of the Habsburg Imperial Family, whose various conditions are more suitable. However, some people advocate not establishing a new monarch, continuing to retain the current regency system, and appointing Admiral Horthy's son (currently the Director of the National Railway Bureau) as Regent to respond. In short, this issue is expected to be the focus of parliamentary discussion soon.

### Investigation of Household Registration Nearing Completion, Evacuation of Residents Becomes More Active, 10,000 Refugees in Shelters to Be Repatriated Next Month, Factories Dismissing Workers Must Help Raise Funds for Return Travel

It is heard that the distribution of household registration forms by the Public and French Concession police departments is nearing completion. Authorities stated yesterday (6th) that the household registration work in the two concessions may be completed within the lunar new year. However, the household registration method in the Western District differs from that of the two concessions, and the distribution of forms has not yet been fully completed, so the investigation in the Western District may not be completed until the end of this month.

All Shelters to Close

Various relief organizations in the city, due to recent reductions in donations and taxes, find it difficult to continue providing for refugees. They gathered at the Refugee Relief Association a few days ago to discuss solutions. Attendees included Huang Hanzhi and Wen Lanting from the Cili Society, Manyan Fang from the Cili branch, and Yuan Ludeng from the association. After discussion, it was determined that it was impossible to maintain operations, and all shelters would be closed on March 15. The majority of the refugees in the shelters are elderly, weak, disabled, women, and children. Originally, there were plans to continue providing for them, but now they have to be repatriated. Repatriation fees will still be issued by the Refugee Association as usual, with each adult receiving 50 yuan and each child receiving 38 yuan, so that they can return to their hometowns and make a living after leaving the shelters. It is heard that the total number of refugees is still around 10,000, and it is estimated that this repatriation fee will require a huge sum of 400,000 to 500,000 yuan.

Worker Dismissal, Subsidy Standards

The Industrial and Social Affairs Department of the Public Works Bureau is now issuing the following announcement in response to requests: "The Japanese authorities have decided to propose a standard for the payment of dismissal subsidies for factories not under Japanese control.

(3) The calculation of worker income should be based on the wages of November of the previous year. (4) When factories dismiss workers, they should arrange for the workers and their families to return home, purchasing train and boat tickets on their behalf, and not paying cash. (5) Subsidies for part-time workers should be calculated proportionally according to the above table. (Note) The above standards are a minimum amount."

### Hong Kong and Philippines Postal and Telegraph Services Must Be Rerouted via Tokyo

Kawasaki, a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai, stated in response to questions from reporters that although normal telegraphic rates between Hong Kong and Japan have been restored, Shanghai is still unable to communicate directly with Hong Kong or Manila.

### More Than 200 Overseas Chinese from Hong Kong Arrive in Shanghai by Ship via Guangdong, Many Overseas Chinese in Hong Kong Go to the Mainland via Guangzhou Bay

After the outbreak of the Pacific War on December 8 of last year, Hong Kong was attacked at the same time. In less than three weeks, the British army was defeated and the city fell. The first batch of about 300 Overseas Chinese evacuated from Hong Kong arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning on the Japanese Tsukuba Maru via Guangzhou. According to those who came from Hong Kong, Japanese planes came to bomb the city at about 7 a.m. on December 8. Because they did not know that a war had broken out beforehand, and because Hong Kong had held several air raid drills in the past, they still thought it was an air raid drill when the Japanese planes came to bomb that morning. Moreover, the Japanese planes were already overhead when the alarm sounded, so they did not feel anything unusual. After a while, Japanese warships also came to attack, and for a time, shells and bombs rained down, and the rumbling sound never stopped. The city was thrown into chaos.

It was then learned that the Japanese army had also attacked Kowloon for only five days before the British army withdrew from Kowloon. In addition to being attacked by sea and air, Hong Kong was also shelled across the river from Kowloon by the Japanese army. The people were terrified day and night, surrounded by the sea on all sides, and unable to escape. When the ceasefire was signed on the 25th, the Japanese army entered Hong Kong on the 28th, and order gradually returned. However, there were concerns about food supplies. The Japanese army announced the evacuation of the population, and the Chinese left Hong Kong one after another.

Most went to the mainland via Guangzhou Bay. Most of the Chinese whose ancestral homes were on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines waited in Guangzhou for ships to come to Shanghai. According to the visitors, the insurance procedures for taking a ship out of Guangzhou were very strict, and there were no regular ships, so waiting for a ship took a considerable amount of time. It would only be convenient after direct Shanghai-Hong Kong regular ships were opened. Although the Japanese-owned East Asia Shipping Company is planning to open routes, it must wait for the permit from the Japanese naval authorities to be issued, so the date of resumption is still difficult to predict.

### Pharmacy Clerk Neglects Duty, Drops Wrong Medicine

The German pharmacy of Yan Yichang (61 years old) of Ningbo, located at 28 Avenue Foch, French Concession, was opened by Yan Yichang. On the 2nd of this month, a staff member of Wang Dasheng Incense Candle Shop at 28 Rue Notre Dame, Mr. Ma, took a prescription to the pharmacy after suffering an illness. Unexpectedly, after decocting and drinking the medicine, his head suddenly swelled like a bucket. After a doctor examined the discarded medicine, he realized that the wrong medicine had been dispensed. He negotiated with the pharmacy, and the pharmacy found out that the medicine was actually picked up by Zhu, the owner of the Daxin Laundry Shop on Route des Soeurs, because the clerk had carelessly dropped the medicine package. Ma suspected that the pharmacy was neglecting its duties, so he reported it to the French Concession police, who sent detectives to investigate and found that it was true. Yesterday, Yan was arrested for questioning.

### Rice Shop Shortchanges Rice, Assaults Customer

He discovered on the spot that the quantity was insufficient, and argued with the shop. Unexpectedly, Wang Zhisheng of the shop was extremely unreasonable and instigated the shop assistants to beat Lu at the door, causing him to be covered in injuries and blood. The rice-buying men and women were shocked when they saw this.

The over-the-counter market for public bonds soared again yesterday. Class C even surpassed the highest price of 71.1 yuan on November 21 of last year. With such a rapid rise, it seems like the short sellers are in a fog, not knowing the cause of the losses. In fact, there has long been an organization of bullish companies in the over-the-counter market, and now there is good news coming constantly, so they have something to rely on, resulting in this high price. Yesterday's rise saw a new high price for Class A, and Class C opened with Lianyi selling at a price of 70.02 yuan. Chen Kangyu Xingyuansheng bravely bought in, and the market price went straight up to the highest new record of 71.12 yuan, the highest price in the second half of the 30th year.

### Sudden Bad News, Gold Price Falls Back

Yesterday, the black market for spot gold first rose and then fell. This was due to a sudden rumor of profit-taking sales. The gold firms saw the high price and competed to sell. The confidence of all parties turned from firm to weak. The market opened 100 yuan lower in the morning, at 12,300 yuan. A certain gold firm bought 10 taels for a client at 12,250 yuan. Tong Kangyong Hefang and retail investors absorbed the supply and raised the price significantly, rising step by step by 350 yuan. 10 taels were traded at 12,600 yuan. The financial community and the two gold firms suddenly sold off heavily, and there were rumors of profit-taking sales. Cheng Ji and De Cheng also sold strongly, and Yong Yu sold even more actively. The price fell step by step by 350 yuan, falling to 12,250 yuan. Yong Fengyu bought in later, and Tong Kangyong continued to buy, raising the price to 12,300 yuan. The gold firms sold again, and the lowest price was 12,230 yuan. At that time, speculators bought in, and the price rose slightly. At noon, the lowest transaction price was 12,280 yuan, 120 yuan lower than the previous day. After the close, there were buyers only at 12,230 yuan. The difference between the high and low prices on the day was 370 yuan. The transaction volume was still thin. The exchange price of gold ornaments was still 1,300 yuan per tael (150 yuan lower for purchases). Silver was quoted at 14 yuan, and the black market was at 10 yuan, but there were still no sellers.

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw British and American gold pounds rise by 15 yuan each, with the former at 225 yuan and the latter at 235 yuan. US dollar notes fell slightly to 16.7 yuan. Hong Kong notes continued to rise to 2.9 yuan, and small notes still had to be reduced by 0.05 yuan. Military notes rose slightly to 3.9667 yuan.

Savings Deposits in the Four Banks

...Can Be Cashed Out Early...

The savings deposits of the four savings banks in this city are divided into fixed-term, long-term, current, and installment types. Since December 8, the bank, in view of the increasing unemployment and return to hometowns of Shanghai citizens, and the inability of some installment depositors to continue paying their savings, has adapted to the needs of depositors. For depositors who have not reached the maturity date, a special accommodation is made, allowing members to find a guarantor and cash out the deposit early without interest. In addition, the interest rate for members of the lower period of the 30th year is still 1%, and the interest rate for a two-year fixed deposit is 7%, for a total weekly interest rate of 8%.

### Grain Situation Difficult to Be Optimistic, Wheat Bran Supply Insufficient

Because the weather cleared yesterday morning, people's confidence returned, and the demand on the street decreased, the rise in rice prices has stopped. However, the arrival of rice is scarce, and the outlook for the market is still not optimistic. Qingjiao late rice was sold at 238 yuan, Nangang Dujian was at 220 yuan, and early rice thick japonica and yuan rice were not sold because the holders were unwilling to sell cheaply.

The supply of wheat bran is insufficient to meet the demand, and market prices are rising steadily. Moreover, the stock produced by the Sanxin Factory is running low, and it is unable to supply as much as possible. Therefore, the market yesterday saw a consistent rise in both current and futures prices. Spot prices ranged from 61 yuan, 62 yuan to 62.5 yuan, and the February warehouse receipt ranged from 62 yuan to 63 yuan. No fewer than 3,000 bags were traded.

### Miscellaneous Grains Still Rising

The miscellaneous grains market yesterday showed signs of closing, as the industry is scheduled to start a 10-day year-end holiday on the 9th. Therefore, both buying and selling were weak. As for the inventory of each commodity, it is quite scarce. The market situation of each commodity is described below.

The price of soybeans was stable yesterday morning, and supply and demand were scattered. 100 bags of Tianjin Xin Jinyuan were sold, priced at 153 yuan to 153.5 yuan, 10 bags of Pinghu Duzou were priced at 126 yuan, and one cart of Huaiqiu soybeans was priced at 128.5 yuan.

The shortage of adzuki beans continued to drive up prices. Yesterday, 15 bags of Chongming Sha Chi were sold, priced at 101 yuan, which was 3 yuan higher than before.

The rise in corn prices continued to be strong, which was due to the impact of the grain shortage, and people were optimistic. Yesterday, spot prices rose by another 1-2 yuan, and Yinghua rose by 5-6 yuan. 400 bags of Xigon New Corn were sold, priced at 63 yuan to 63.5 yuan, and 66.5 yuan to 68 yuan was also delivered. In addition, 500 tons of Yinghua, 89 yuan to 94.25 yuan of Hongkou warehouse goods, and 110 yuan to 114 yuan of Hongsheng warehouse goods.

### Cotton Yarn Profit-Taking Sales

The cotton yarn market started high and then stabilized. This was because the continuous rise for many days caused profit-takers to sell. However, the momentum of Japanese yarn was still outstanding, but the transactions were very scarce. The price of 42s Blue Phoenix was 4,180 yuan for factory orders, 20s Yueqin was 2,380 yuan for factory orders, 20s Blue Phoenix spot price was 2,600 yuan, 2,500 yuan for factory orders, 18s Weaver Girl was 2,150 yuan, 60s Xiantao was 6,700 yuan, 20s Double Horse was initially priced at 1,690 yuan, and then fell back to 1,650 yuan, closing 40 yuan lower than the previous day.

### East Cloth More Active

The market for factory cloth continued to be firm yesterday. Although there were not many transactions, the prices of coarse and fine cloth were raised by 0.5 yuan to 1 yuan per bolt. 12-pound Dapeng fine cloth was priced at 95.5 yuan, Fugui fine cloth was priced at 92.75 yuan, and 8-pound Zhenzhong was priced at 56.5 yuan. There were small transactions in the street.

East cloth was still very popular, with a steady stream of buyers due to real sales. In particular, medium-grade fine cloth was the most in demand, with prices continuing to rise by 1 yuan to 1.5 yuan per bolt. 12-pound Flying Fish fine cloth rose to 93.5 yuan, Caiqiu Yanghe rose to 93 yuan, Laba Tong rose to 91.5 yuan, and Wufu Blue Double Fish rose to 92 yuan. Fine twill also showed activity, with Blue Double Fish priced at 84.5 yuan and Wufu fine twill priced at 84.23 yuan. However, the factory orders for Longtou fine cloth were flat. It had once risen sharply to 96 yuan in the morning, but then fell back to 95 yuan at the close due to scattered hoarding. Four Gentlemen serge was sold at a high of 3.275 yuan, but also followed Longtou down, closing at 3.23 yuan at noon. The spot price was 3.22 yuan.

Spring and Autumn

### Welcoming the New Year

— Wei Ge

Recently, a series of warm days made it seem like spring, until the previous dynasty flew away, and the cold wave repeatedly threatened the world, only then did I realize that the old lunar year had not yet passed. Counting on my fingers, the New Year's Eve dinner is in sight. In previous years, at this time, every family was busy preparing for the New Year, children were clamoring for new clothes, inviting friends to their homes for gatherings, and being invited to others' homes for a few meals. In the circle of acquaintances, everyone's situation was not so good, but they could afford to spend on some seasonal items. This year, however, no one has such feelings.

Time urges people on, but we still have to get through it. Whether you are hiding in a bathhouse or at home, time will take you through the New Year. Naturally, you also have a share in the New Year. You may wish to gather all the money in your pockets, freshen up your old coat, brew a cup of fragrant tea, listen to a few episodes of Suzhou storytelling, or simply stay at home and sit idly. Memories will take you back to your childhood. The noisy drums will reappear in your ears, and vaguely, the dragon lanterns you saw as a child seem to reappear. In this way, even though you are chased by poverty, the New Year is still very kind to you. If you can look forward a little further, you will see your own smile in the mirror.

The harsh winter is about to pass, let us wait for the flowers and plants to sprout.

### Stage and Screen

— Tai Xu

The Shanghai Art Troupe, which is scheduled to perform "Yang Guifei" (tentatively titled "The Palace of Eternal Life") at the Carlton Theater on New Year's Day according to the Yu calendar, is a mixed compilation of actors from "Xin Yi," "Tian Feng," and "Yin Lian." The script is by Fei Mu, and his analysis of the love between Emperor Ming of Tang and Yang Guifei is quite unique. The performance will also take the form of a musical drama, so the music part will be organized by students from the "Music Academy" into a symphony orchestra. Famous musicians of the past are specially commissioned to create the musical movements in the play. Mr. Huang Zi has also specially composed the music for "Song of Everlasting Regret." Liu Qiong has tentatively agreed to guest star as Emperor Ming of Tang.

The second script is said to be "The Hunchback of Notre Dame," which Yuan Muzhi had prepared for "Amateur" to perform. To highlight the leading lady, Ma Xuwibang was invited to direct.

"Tian Gong" had initially scheduled Gu Zhongyi's "Narcissus" for the New Year, but it has now been abandoned due to unforeseen circumstances. Instead, Cao Yu's "Sunrise" will be adapted. As a result, Sun Jinglu may return to her "mother's home." If this is the case, "Nian Hua's" second film, "Hell Angel" (directed by Jiang Qifeng), may have to find another leading actress.

### Quick Storytelling (Entertainment Miscellany)

— Ze Fu

Quick storytelling is a type of storytelling that gets faster and faster, as the name suggests. It is one of the northern miscellaneous tunes. When singing, it is like drum storytelling. One person sits and plays the stringed instrument, and the other stands and sings. Sometimes they play the octagonal drum. However, the organization of the lyrics is completely different from drum storytelling. Its organization is generally divided into six parts, namely (1) Poetry section, generally seven characters per line and eight lines, with interspersed filler words. (2) Annotation head, using simple words and phrases to summarize the main idea of the whole piece, usually seven characters and two lines, starting with the words "It describes." (3) First Falling Spring Cloud Board, which is the first main part of the lyrics, sung more slowly, like spring clouds emerging from the mountains, slowly unfolding. (4) Second Falling Flowing Water Board, which is the second main part of the lyrics, sung slightly faster, like flowing water flowing eastward, surging endlessly. (5) Spoken dialogue or poetic dialogue, the length of the spoken dialogue varies, the poetic dialogue is often four lines of seven characters each, and sometimes both spoken dialogue and poetic dialogue are used. (6) Third Falling Continuous Pearl Tune, which is the third main part of the lyrics, sung extremely fast, like pearls falling on a plate, with a clear and continuous sound. However, in addition to the three falls, there are sometimes five falls, such as "Blood-stained Decree," where there is one more fall for both Spring Cloud and Continuous Pearl. The stories sung are mostly about war, such as "Changban Slope," "Yin Soul Formation," and "Havoc in Heaven," because their plots are tense and consistent with the nature of the storytelling.

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

17. Whereabouts

But as soon as the three of them walked into Private Room No. 6 of the Longfeng Restaurant, Lao Han was the first to be stunned. Because Shao Hua was always alone in the private room waiting for them, and he had never brought a friend with him. But today, two more people had suddenly been added to the table, and they were two middle-aged female guests around forty years old.

While Lao Han was stunned, there were two other people in the room who were also stunned, and their faces had turned very pale and ugly. The first was the thin and beautiful of the two female guests, and the second was Mei Bao. She did not pay attention to the fat and tall female guest sitting at the head of the table, but what surprised her was the kind and fair female guest sitting on the left facing Shao Hua. Her face was so familiar that she felt her heart ache and she almost cried immediately.

"Aunt, Mom, that short one is..." Shao Hua pointed excitedly at Mei Bao, speaking to Luo Xiangqi and his mother; but at the same time, he had already seen some strange expressions on Xiangqi's face.

I really don't know how much strength Xiang used to restrain her emotions, and barely uttered a trembling voice.

"Girl, come over here!" She beckoned to Mei Bao. "Is your surname really Han?" (328)
