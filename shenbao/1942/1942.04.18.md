With Laval in power, France will assist Germany in taking offensive action in an attempt to regain control of Syria.

### President Roosevelt Will Make an Important Announcement, Rumors of a Cabinet Reshuffle in the US

Washington, 17th (Havas) – President Roosevelt's secretary, O’Leary, has announced that the President is scheduled to make an important announcement to the press at 2:30 PM today. The content of the announcement could not be ascertained this morning.

Tokyo, 17th (Domei) – The "Yomiuri Shimbun" reports from Argentina's capital that President Roosevelt is expected to announce an important cabinet reshuffle at 10:30 AM today (Washington time), and that Secretary of War Stimson and Secretary of the Navy Knox will be dismissed.

The State Department believes that the notices received by American nationals have nothing to do with the reorganization of the French government.

### Retracing History (Part 2)

The Unification of the Mauryan Dynasty

At that time, an Indian jade merchant, Chandragupta, who had contact with Alexander, was the founder of the later Mauryan Dynasty (Jhe Manrya Eemqire). He also rose up to imitate Alexander's actions. He organized a northern bandit army and invaded Magadha, establishing himself as king. At that time, Seleucus (Seluceus vhe Cou Vuerov), Alexander's successor in Central Asia, led an army to conquer him, but was defeated. As a result, the mountainous area west of the Indus River was also recovered by the Indians. Seleucus even had to marry his daughter to Chandragupta. This was the first unification of India. It is said that this king once had 9,000 war elephants, 8,000 chariots, 30,000 cavalry, and 600,000 infantry, but this may be an overestimate. He built his capital on the south bank of the Ganges River, in what is now Raipur, also known in China as Wangshe City. He emphasized enlightened government, paid attention to water conservancy, and the country was well-governed. However, the southern part of the Indian peninsula has always been isolated from the north, so it was never ruled by him. After his death, his grandson Ashoka (Asoka), also known as the famous Buddhist protector King Ashoka (also called Ashoka), succeeded him. It is said that when he first ascended the throne, he was extremely cruel and tyrannical. Later, he conquered Kalinga (Kalingr) in the east and personally witnessed the horrors of killing - according to one of his inscriptions, a total of 100,000 people were killed and 150,000 were captured - so he immediately realized his mistake and abandoned force, specializing in spiritual transformation, and converting to Buddhism, propagating Buddhist doctrines, building monasteries extensively, and selecting eminent monks to compile the Tripitaka and codify Buddhist scriptures. In addition, he sent princes and princesses to Ceylon and Myanmar, leading monks to convert them to Buddhism. These missionary groups even reached Persia, Egypt, and Greece. Although they had little success in religious terms in these places, they promoted cultural exchange between the East and the West, allowing Greek and Egyptian cultural elements to permeate Buddhism. The fact that Buddhism has become one of the world's major religions is largely due to King Ashoka's promotion. He reigned for 37 years and died in 232 BC. His empire was divided between his two grandsons. After that, it declined day by day. In 184 BC, the Andhra Dynasty in southern India rose up and conquered Magadha, possessing most of India. The Mauryan Dynasty came to an end, but Buddhism was still prevalent.

At this time, Central Asia was still the world of the Greeks. Antioch (i.e., the state built by Seleucus) was divided into Bactria and Parthia, both of which successively invaded the northwestern border of India. By the time the Yuezhi rose up, the father and son of Kujula Kadphises and Vima Takto of the Kushan Dynasty successively conquered Bactria and Parthia, and destroyed Kashmir. In 120 AD, the famous Yuezhi king, Kanishka, ascended the throne and succeeded King Ashoka as a protector of Buddhism. In the fourth century, the Gupta Dynasty in southern India rose up and restored the territory of the Mauryan Dynasty, creating a golden age for India. Literature, art, and science flourished. The Chinese monk Faxian sought Buddhist scriptures in India, which was appropriate at this time. Because the Gupta Dynasty revered Brahmanism, Buddhism gradually declined, but the Brahmanism that was revived at this time was mixed with some Buddhist elements and was not the Hinduism of the Vedic era. In the middle of the fifth century, the Hephtalites (i.e., the White Huns as they are known to Westerners) rose up and invaded India in 470 AD, occupying central and northern territories. The Gupta Dynasty declined.

In the middle of the sixth century, the Maukhari Dynasty rose up in northern India, expelling the Hephtalites and unifying India. For a time, both civil and military achievements were at their peak. In the early Tang Dynasty, Xuanzang traveled west to India, which was appropriate at the time when King Harsha Shiladitya was in power, encouraging scholarship, and enlightened government. Buddhism underwent a revival. When King Harsha died, his minister, Arjuna, established himself. At that time, Emperor Taizong of Tang sent Wang Xuance as an envoy to India, but he was rejected by Arjuna. Xuance then summoned troops from Tibet and Nepal and defeated India, capturing the Indian king and presenting him as a prisoner in Chang'an. The following year, Emperor Taizong of Tang died and was buried in Zhaoling. Arjuna's stone statue was placed next to the tomb along with the stone statues of Songtsen Gampo (King of Tibet) and the kings of Gaochang and the Turks to boast of the military achievements of this great emperor. Since then, India has been divided into small states, suffered frequent foreign invasions, and gradually entered a dark age. The influence of Buddhism was gradually replaced by Brahmanism.

Kashmir

Kashmir, in the far north of India, is adjacent to China's Xinjiang. It is located between the Himalayas and the Karakoram Mountains, and the terrain is high. The world calls it "the roof of the world". The capital city is Srinagar, which is uniquely located on a plain with a good climate. It was once the old capital of the Mughal Empire. The famous Kashmir shawls are gathered and distributed here. There are many wild animals in the nearby mountains, and many Westerners hunt here. The biography of India in Book 54 of the Book of Liang says: "... Gold is produced exclusively in Kashmir (Kashmir), with a pure yellow color, and its texture is as fine as the lotus flowers inside the hibiscus flowers. The people of the country first take it to decorate Buddhist temples, burn incense and offer sacrifices every day, and then remove the waste. Merchants collect it from the temples and resell it to other countries..." The left picture shows Kashmiris felling trees.

### Britain is Actively Making Military Preparations in the Near East, Building Fortifications and Trenches on the Iraqi-Syrian Border, Auchinleck Inspects the Near East Defense Zone

Istanbul, 17th (Domei) – According to reports from Baghdad, the British Near East Army fears that German troops may attack the Near East by passing through Turkey and the Caucasus, so they are currently urgently building fortifications and trenches in various areas of northern Iraq and Syria. More than 10,000 Iraqi and Syrian workers in the vicinity of Mosul and Kirkuk, under the supervision of British technicians, are building military roads, trenches, and tank obstacles.

This improper attack by Soviet political circles will only further alienate Turkey from the Soviet Union at this critical juncture. The Turkish official news agency has not commented on the Soviet attitude. However, Joshiya is known for being pro-British and pro-Soviet, so the publication of this article is of great significance. At the same time, the Prime Minister has summoned the editors of Istanbul newspapers to hold a special meeting in the Turkish capital. At that time, he may request the journalists to avoid heated criticism of foreign policy to avoid hindering the government's work.

### Suspects in the Attack on Papen Continue to Be Tried

Turkish Capital, 16th Havas News Agency Electric Dispatch: The suspects in the case of the attack on the German Ambassador Papen continued to be tried here today. The defendants, Soviet citizens Pavlov and Kunilov, denied participating in the incident, claiming that someone wanted to alienate the relationship between Turkey and the Soviet Union, hence this incident. As for the Turkish defendants, Abdul Rahman and Suleiman, they were tools hired by others. This kind of trap and false accusation is in line with the methods commonly used by the Trotskyists. These two people were obviously hired by that faction. Moreover, the location of the bombing and the route of Ambassador Papen's passage were carefully calculated in advance to maintain a considerable distance to avoid injuring the ambassador. It can be seen that the purpose of this action was not really to harm Papen but to alienate Soviet-Turkish relations. In short, these two people and the defendant Podusnik, a Croat who has not yet been arrested, are strangers to us. The court then summoned various witnesses. Finally, Pavlov requested to be released on bail, hire a private Soviet lawyer, and meet with the lawyer, all of which were rejected by the court.

Stockholm, 17th Havas News Agency Electric Dispatch: Havas World News Agency special dispatch: The German army has intensified its offensive in the central and northern sections of the Eastern Front. Both German and Soviet war reports state that fierce fighting is taking place from the Finnish front to the Bryansk area, but there is no news from the southern section. According to a Berlin dispatch from a certain newspaper, the German army does not intend to launch a general offensive before May or June of this year.

German newspapers this month have published a statement to the public from the country's authorities, stating that the Supreme Command is preparing for a decisive battle, and the public should trust it. According to military personnel here, the climate in the southern section of the Soviet Union is harsh.

### The Sacred Cow of India

In the special feature "A Pilgrimage to the Indian Peninsula," which our newspaper serialized a few days ago, it was mentioned that if a car hits and kills a "sacred cow" in that area, extremely unfortunate disasters will occur. Isn't this strange? Originally, the status of the "sacred cow" in India is higher than that of the sages in our history. Chinese sages are worshiped by everyone throughout history, while Indians worship sacred cows in the same way we worship sages. Although the Chinese added the word "sacred" to the word "person" when referring to sages, everyone still regards them as human beings. However, Indians not only do not regard sacred cows as beasts but also treat them as gods above humans. Therefore, the Indian attitude of worshiping sacred cows is a hundred times more solemn and earnest than the Chinese attitude of worshiping sages. Therefore, sacred cows are sacred and inviolable. If anyone offends them, the people will consider it a heinous crime, and everyone will severely punish him. How much more so if a car hits and kills a sacred cow? That would be even more terrible. Many sacred cows are kept in every Indian temple. Because the people worship and offer to them extremely, they are allowed to run wild on the streets all day long without any restraint. If they want, seeing something they can eat in a shop's window, they can boldly run over and eat their fill. If they are scavenging for food in someone's house and cannot find anything for a while, they can freely roam everywhere, whether it is a young woman's bedroom or someone's kitchen... No one shows the slightest sign of disgust or rejection and generously offers them food. If a sacred cow breaks into the house of a poor family, they can only kneel before it and pray sincerely to it. But if it does not understand the suffering of the poor, it will still be allowed to move freely. From this, it can be seen that the status of sacred cows in India is truly a hundred times higher than that of sages in China. Although a sage has attained the status of a sage, if he indulges in debauchery, plunders the people, and breaks into the boudoirs of young women, he will ultimately lose his noble status, while a sacred cow remains sacred. In the deep mountains and forests of India, there are a tribe of Todas who have a similar situation to the Indians' worship of sacred cows. However, what they worship is the water buffalo. Water buffaloes are their only property, their only food, their only occupation, and they have created their only religious concept in their lives, naturally leading to many religious rituals. Every day, when the water buffaloes go out in the morning and return in the evening, the whole family, along with the monks, respectfully salute the water buffaloes. At the same time, they also have a prayer of blessing, which the monks silently recite:

"Sacred cow, bless you with health, may we all be equally healthy forever!"

The work of milking must be done by the monks; no one else is allowed to do it without permission, because this is considered a sacred and serious matter, and the monks must be asked to do it. In addition, there is another taboo, which is as important and cannot be ignored as in the old society of China, which is that women are always considered unclean things, so no woman may touch this sacred cow, and no woman is allowed to step into the sacred cow's shed.

The superstition of the Indian people is even greater than that of the Chinese. They always believe that the sacred cow is the representative of God. It will bring happiness to the world and its power is above all else. (Amazing)

### The Eastern Nation of Female Authority: Sketches of Burmese Women

The most enchanting aspect of Burma is not the scenery of Maymyo, nor the royal palace of Mandalay, but rather the women of Burma! They are all very beautiful, and there are beauties among them that rival those of Suzhou and Hangzhou in our country.

Rosy Complexion, Brilliant Attire

Their skin is usually bronze or yellow-olive. Generally speaking, their complexion is rosier than that of men, their noses are flatter, their lips are thicker, and their eyebrows are coarser. However, their eyebrow drawing and lip coloring are the same as those of women in our country. Their clothing, no matter how old or worn, is mostly very clean, and the tailoring of the clothes is very special. The upper garment has long, narrow sleeves and a short hem reaching the waist. Now, new-style loose-sleeved and loose-bodied garments are called "Joyok Ln Gee," resembling Chinese-style short jackets. The color of the clothes is mostly milky white, using thin gauze fabric in the sunny season, with embroidered flowers and plants on the cuffs and edges. Ladies of higher social standing use thin silk gauze. In autumn, with the cool and cold winter, the ladies also use flannel and other valuable materials, and the colors often imitate flowers and plants in the forest, or colorful butterflies. The material of the upper garment is not as precious and bright as that of the skirt. The skirt is a very simple piece of silk or cloth, four and a half feet long and five feet wide. A black skirt head tightly surrounds the waist, and the left and right ends of the skirt are twisted into belt-like strips, tied together. In the era of the Burmese king: the skirt was long and reached the ground, with a slit on one side, revealing the leg to the knee when walking, commonly called "Tamein." It is said that the reason for the slit was to prevent men from disguising themselves as women and sneaking into the palace, because men had tattoos on their legs, so it was easy to tell. Since Upper Burma became a British possession, the "Tamein" was abandoned and replaced with the "Longyi." The skirt end was no longer slit, because they believed it was unseemly for women to show their legs, especially young girls were most afraid of it. When they wear the "Longyi" and walk, they are graceful and dignified, and the beauty of the curves of their legs can be fully expressed in movement, giving people a sense of beauty. As for the women of the lower social classes in the countryside, most of their upper bodies are naked to the waist, and they wear a "Longyi" that hangs to their heels.

Valuing Dark Hair Above All Else

Women do not wear headscarves. Their hair is almost purplish-black and very long, some even reaching the ground. If it is short, they use wigs to add length. The way they comb their hair is very particular. They usually use sesame oil or coconut oil, and comb it into a shiny, high bun. If she is an unmarried girl, a small tuft of hair is revealed at the end of her bun, fluttering in the wind, how elegant and noble! Recently, a kind of airplane-style bun has become popular. The way to comb it is to twist the long hair behind the head, with a long, specially made comb wrapped around the center of the bun. They value their dark hair above all else and rarely cut it; if someone wants to cut her hair, she would rather give up her nose instead! They often say: "A man's dignity is in his arms; a woman's dignity is in her bun."

Delicate Hands, Large Feet, Pearl and Jewel Radiance

Burmese women have naturally beautiful hands, like soft, white jade. They also like to wear jade rings, and the radiance of pearls and jewels further reveals their beauty. Modern girls also carry new-style handbags, as well as small paper or silk parasols that block the sun. They are so transparent that they resemble moonlight, wrapped around their dark buns. Sometimes, due to the transmission of sunlight, the flowers on the parasol are particularly bright and beautiful, while orange-yellow flower shadows and leaf shadows adorn their bodies, just like butterflies in a flowery world.

Burmese women's feet are very strong and large, incomparable to those of Chinese women; they do not wear socks, and go barefoot at home, but the slippers they wear when going out are very exquisite. In the past, such slippers were only allowed to be worn by palace maids and officials' wives. Recently, women who have received modern colonial education also wear high-heeled shoes, and wealthy families also wear large gold anklets.

Giant Cigars, a Foot Long

Women love gold the most, and all kinds of decorations are made of gold, such as gold bracelets, gold anklets, gold button needles, gold hairbands, gold beads, and gold clasps. Sometimes they also use gold and diamonds, real stones, and jade. Ordinary women have at least one gold necklace.

Obvious and destructive of natural beauty. What is worse, they also have an awful habit of keeping a giant cigar in their mouth, almost a foot long. This cigar can be passed around for many people to smoke, unafraid of dirt or germs. They also like to chew betel nut mixed with lime powder to add to the fun, staining their adorable lips with a horrifying blood-red color. Such destruction of natural beauty is really foolish. They are highly skilled in the art of cursing. Sometimes, back and forth, they argue for half a day, without a single sentence being repeated, tirelessly waging a war of words.

Smart and Capable, Renowned Women Throughout History

The most moving aspect of Burmese women is their competence. They do not distinguish between the duties of men and women, and can handle everything, so they are called the most virtuous housewives, the most beautiful wives, and the most compassionate mothers. They have more business acumen than men, which makes people praise them endlessly. Now, let me introduce a few famous women in Burmese history: female masters of Buddhism. In the golden age of Burma, during the Pagan dynasty, Princess Dhanmati (Jhanbyin), daughter of King Kyanzittha, was proficient in literature and religion, and taught Buddhist scriptures and doctrines to monks. Female literary talents: Princess Hanig-HtaiK Kbanng Sin, daughter of Queen Ma-unya-gale of the Western Palace, wrote longevity dramas such as Wethaya, Yondawinta, and Yiran, which are still praised by literature lovers today. There are also many women who are famous for their melodious rhythms and beautiful writing, poetry, and have won the glory of being the "Burmese Shakespeare," comparable to other male writers. Female rulers in politics: history proves that they also played a very smart and capable role on the political stage, such as Queen Htuga Saw of the Taungoo dynasty, who assisted in state affairs and was known as the king's right arm. There was also Princess Shin Saw Bu of the Pegu dynasty (1453-72), who ruled wisely, and people are still remembering her merits four hundred years later.

Women Shoulder All Kinds of Work

The competence of Burmese women is obvious throughout Burma. If we travel along the Irrawaddy River, the facts are right before our eyes. No matter what kind of business or what area, they have made sacred contributions. As soon as the ship docks, a team of female workers and female laborers jump on board, busy carrying luggage for the passengers.

### HSBC and Mercantile Bank to Release US Dollar Safe Deposit Box Funds

The English-language "Great American Evening News" reports that HSBC Bank of this city is now continuing to pay depositors with the third batch of deposits. Mercantile and Citibank will begin to release funds on the 24th (Monday). As for Chase Bank, it is also expected to follow suit and release the third batch of deposits soon. Although this matter has not yet been officially decided, according to a certain Chase Bank employee, the bank has a good chance of being able to release deposits within a reasonable short period of time, like the other three banks.

Three Withdrawals from the Dutch Bank

The Japanese authorities are well aware of the significant difficulties encountered by citizens whose funds were frozen in Allied banks, so they allowed the release of these deposits. At the same time, it is reported that the Dutch Bank of this city began paying out the third batch of deposits from April 9th, making it the first Allied bank to release funds. The conditions for the payment amount are the same as those of other banks, that is, 30% of the remaining deposits as of December 6th of last year is allowed to be paid out. The total of the three payments accounts for 80% of the original remaining deposits.

Procedures for Withdrawing Stored US Dollars

Also, according to the Shanghai "Times," personnel from HSBC and Mercantile Bank announced yesterday morning (the 16th) that US dollar deposits in the safe deposit boxes of the two banks will be returned to all depositors at an exchange rate of 5.55 national currency to 1 US dollar. These US dollars were purchased by the Japanese authorities at the aforementioned official bank exchange rate shortly after the outbreak of the Pacific War. However, the US dollars purchased by the Japanese authorities from enemy aliens will be sold on the open market at the prevailing exchange rate, and the surplus funds will be transferred to the accounts of each depositor in the Japanese bank entrusted with liquidating the aforementioned two banks. As for the US dollar safe deposit boxes of Citibank, they are still not open, pending further notice.

### Enthusiastic Application for Subletting Permits

### Hungarian Overseas Chinese Association Registers Overseas Chinese

At the beginning of this month, the consulates of various neutral countries in this city responded to the request of the Japanese authorities and issued notices to register overseas Chinese and overseas Chinese businessmen. Countries that have successively processed registrations include Germany, Italy, Denmark, Spain, etc. Hungary does not have a consulate in Shanghai, so the Italian Consulate General in Shanghai is acting as an agent for the rights and interests of overseas Chinese. Yesterday, the Italian Consulate also notified Hungarian overseas Chinese to register at the Hungarian Overseas Chinese Association at 209 Yuanmingyuan Road before the 25th of this month. At the same time, all Hungarian commercial firms, warehouses, factories, buildings, real estate, and other properties should also be registered there without delay. It is also learned that the registration of overseas Chinese and overseas Chinese businessmen from neutral countries is a prelude to the Japanese side's control of third-country enterprises in this city. Third-country enterprises in this city will all organize public associations to assist in handling the control affairs.

### The Two Authorities Will Adopt New Measures to Suppress Prices

In order to revive the entire industry and commerce of Shanghai, the Price Management Committees of the two concessions have been actively working on suppressing commodity prices and restoring normal transactions in recent days. It was learned from the two authorities yesterday that the members of the Price Management Committees of the two concessions are currently consulting back and forth with the responsible persons of the Japanese authorities, and plan to adopt various new measures to suppress commodity prices on a large scale in the short term. It is heard that the main objectives of the current consultations between the two authorities and the Japanese side are as follows: 1. To dredge up the sources of various commodities, so as to balance the supply; 2. To ban non-profit manipulation and monopolies; 3. To stop black market transactions and restore legitimate trade.

Adopting a Distribution System for the Sale of Goods

The Price Management Committees of the two concessions believe that there is no shortage of various commodities in the city, but the prices are rising, and users find it difficult to purchase them. This is all caused by the illegal manipulation and monopoly of speculative merchants who hoard goods and wait for higher prices. In order to ban this evil practice, it has been discussed at length that, from now on, the authorities will allocate the current goods needed by each merchant on a daily basis based on the scope of the store's capital. However, the sale of these goods must be started by issuing invoices and recording them in the account, so as to serve as a reference when distributing goods next time. At the same time, the re-selling merchants must allow citizens to freely choose and purchase, and must not refuse to sell.

Setting Legal Profits for Firms

It is found that businessmen in various industries in this city have always been free to trade in any goods. However, these treacherous merchants are extremely greedy and actually raise prices on their own under the pretext of insufficient current goods, in order to obtain illegal profits. It is learned that the two authorities believe that the merchants' repeated raising of commodity prices is illegal, harms people's livelihood, and is especially harmful. For this reason, they are actively planning to set price limits for various commodities and order all firms to operate in unison. At the same time, when assessing and setting price limits for goods, they will conduct thorough consultations to give legitimate profits to the re-selling firms, and will subsequently determine the appropriate profit margin once a month or two months, depending on the circumstances.

### British and Dutch Overseas Chinese Organizations Issue Notices to Register for Repatriation

The first batch of British and American overseas Chinese gathered in Shanghai have already arrived in this city from Yantai a few days ago. As for the British and American overseas Chinese in this city, in addition to the British overseas Chinese who have registered for repatriation with the American Overseas Chinese Association, the British overseas Chinese Association also issued a notice yesterday to register for repatriation on a fixed date.

The British Overseas Chinese Association Handles Registration

The notice states that arrangements may have been made for the repatriation of British people in occupied China. Although no final decision has been obtained at present, and the Association cannot guarantee that repatriation will be carried out, British people who wish to be repatriated should register first. The registration location is at the registration office at 219 Jiangxi Road. The registration period starts from April 20th (Monday) and ends on April 25th (Saturday). The time is from 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Registration forms can be obtained from the office. After filling them out, they must be submitted in person to the office for verification and must present their passport or consular registration receipt. Cowlair White, Chairman of the British Overseas Chinese Association.

Accommodation Problems for Overseas Chinese Gathered in Shanghai

At the same time, the British and American overseas Chinese who have been evacuated from various places in North China and Central China to Shanghai, their accommodation problem has been contacted by the Japanese Consulate General in this city with the Cathay, International, Du Cheng, Richard, Broadway and other major hotels, and it is hoped that those who have spare rooms in private homes can also accommodate these British and American overseas Chinese. In order to assist the Japanese side in solving this problem, the British and American Overseas Chinese Associations in this city jointly issued a notice yesterday, saying that a number of British and American overseas Chinese will come here soon to prepare for repatriation, and hereby request British and American families in this city who have spare rooms to accommodate them to immediately notify their respective associations. The association will give appropriate subsidies to those who provide accommodation.

Dutch Overseas Chinese Will Also Register for Repatriation

It is also learned that Dutch overseas Chinese in occupied China will also implement repatriation in accordance with the agreement between the Japanese side and the Allied countries to exchange overseas Chinese. It is reported that the Dutch Overseas Chinese Emergency Committee in this city is handling the registration of repatriates. The committee also issued a notice yesterday, starting to handle registration. It is required that Dutch overseas Chinese in this city register in person at the Dutch Overseas Chinese Emergency Committee at 1594 Avenue Joffre before the 25th of this month. The time is from 10:00 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. As for Dutch people residing outside the urban area of Shanghai, they should immediately contact the Swiss Confederation representative nearby. The locations where the Swiss representative is stationed include Beijing, Tianjin, Qingdao, Hankou, and Guangzhou. However, the repatriation of Dutch overseas Chinese may be held separately from the repatriation of British and American overseas Chinese.

### Fraudulently Scams Residents Under the Guise of Charity

Zhang Yonglin, a native of Suzhou, is 25 years old and lives at 6 Dongfuhai Lane, Park Road, British Concession. He specializes in extortion and fraud for a living. Recently, he came up with a far-fetched idea and colluded with his accomplices Wang Deming and Xiang Shunming, using the name of Yuan Ludeng to call various consulates, saying that a charity organization called Tongren Charity Association has been established, and due to a lack of funds, please donate as much as possible. Those who donate more than 100 yuan will be presented with a large porcelain vase as a souvenir. Many residents and consulates were unaware and were deceived by him. There are dozens of households who were cheated, including Mr. Cheng at 50 Shanghai New Village, Avenue Joffre, Huang Qiongru at 12 Le'an Lane, 613 Avenue Joffre, Zhang Binghui at 378 Route Ferguson, Xi Xiang in Room 21, 6 Rue Doumer and many dozens of others, and the amount of money swindled was between 100 and 200 yuan, amounting to several thousand yuan. Afterwards, the French police force received a report and, investigated by Chief Inspector Gui Baoquan, Detectives Wei Yuansheng, Yan Jinwen, Yang Jiaxue, Xing Shaoxian, learned that Zhang Yonglin had gone to Wang Shaoshan's house at 42 Yongyu Lane, Rue Amiral Bayle, to swindle again. They went there and arrested Zhang, and found a large number of seals of various charitable organizations. However, the accomplices Wang and Xiang have not been caught. The police force is now holding Zhang in custody pending legal proceedings.

### Xin Puyu Hall Urgently Appeals for Donations from All Circles

Currently, the Hall's Deposits and Grain Reserves Can Only Last for Two Months. How to Maintain After That Depends Entirely on Social Assistance.

Xin Puyu Hall is located on Guohuo Road in Nanshi and has been established for 30 years. At present, it houses no fewer than a thousand elderly, weak, disabled, orphaned, and poor children. Taking rice alone as an example, its daily consumption requires more than four bags, and other expenses are conceivable. Recently, prices in Shanghai have soared, and various expenses have increased several times compared with last year. Monthly expenditures of tens of thousands of yuan all depend on enthusiastic donations from all circles to maintain the lives of so many people. Currently, the Hall's deposits and grain reserves can only last for two months. What will happen in the future? Although the Hall is run by the Catholic Church, those who are housed are all Chinese compatriots. Can the warm-hearted people of society bear to ignore them?

Donation Statistics

Recently, the Hall stated that from January to April 17, 1942, Mr. Wang Shenfu and Mr. Chen Hanwen solicited 23,240 yuan (the names of the donors will be published in the newspaper at the end of April to express gratitude).

### Rent Conversion to Banknotes: Tenants Resolutely Oppose, a Minority Refuse Landlords' Demands, Must Reduce Rent by 30% to Maintain Equilibrium

According to the English-language "China Press," a fierce rent dispute has unfolded between landlords and tenants in Shanghai since rents began to skyrocket. The most recent development involves several landlords issuing notices stating that future rent payments must be made in banknotes. This has immediately sparked a backlash from tenants, who are protesting in unison. A small number of determined tenants have taken the lead in resolutely refusing to accept demands for banknote payments. It is said that the number of those following suit is increasing daily, thus greatly increasing the momentum. Tenants who are being harassed are taking a firm stance to protect their rights, strenuously opposing the change to collecting rent in banknotes. Their reason is that the exchange rate between legal tender and banknotes currently differs by 30%. Paying rent in banknotes would be equivalent to raising the rent by 20%. According to the majority of tenants, if landlords reduce rents by 30% to maintain equilibrium, this problem could be resolved. It is said that some tenants have already made this request to landlords, but the landlords' attitude is not yet known for sure. It is also said that the local authorities are closely considering this issue.

### Unmarried Couple Sues in Court: Woman Requests Termination of Engagement, Man Demands Compensation for Losses

Ge Lijuan, a local woman residing at No. 64, Lane 248, Rue Amiral Courbet in the French Concession, is twenty years old this year. Her father, Ge Heqing, previously served as the Director of the Ningbo Public Security Bureau and accumulated considerable wealth. Miss Ge was previously betrothed by her parents to Chen Shiqi (nineteen years old this year), who lives at No. 9, Taoyuan Lane, Avenue Joffre. After the engagement, the two sides had close interactions and took photos together to commemorate the occasion. Unexpectedly, after Ge Heqing passed away last winter, the woman suddenly

Changed Her Usual Behavior

and sent a letter to the man's residence requesting the termination of the engagement. She also commissioned a lawyer to publish a statement in the newspaper denying the engagement. The man believes that Miss Ge's actions are not only treating marriage as child's play but are also completely unreasonable. Therefore, he commissioned lawyer Hu Yongsheng to represent him in filing a lawsuit against Ge Lijuan to compel her to fulfill the engagement. Yesterday, when the two parties were summoned for a joint hearing, Ge Lijuan stated that she and Chen Shiqi had disagreements. For example, if she wanted something, he would refuse in every way. If this situation continued, it would

Affect Lifelong Happiness.

It would be better to terminate the engagement to avoid future pain. Therefore, she requested the termination of the engagement, and so on. Chen Shiqi stated that since their engagement, they had often interacted. Sometimes she would call and ask him to see a movie. They were quite compatible. He requested that she be ordered to fulfill the engagement, or else she should compensate him 30,000 yuan for emotional distress and 5,000 yuan for losses from the engagement banquet, and return the engagement ring and other ornaments, and so on. The judge reviewed the statements and adjourned the case for further deliberation. The French-produced "Da Jian Feng" (Great Health Phoenix) tablets, managed by the Yongxing Foreign Firm, have seen their prices soar due to a shortage of goods. Furthermore, hoarders are buying them at high prices, leading to the discovery of counterfeit products. These counterfeit products are very well made, almost indistinguishable from the real thing. The police once cracked down on a manufacturing facility. Yang Zhenchun, a Hangzhou native residing at No. 72, Tongle Lane, Washington Road, offered eight bottles of Da Jian Feng tablets to Fan Desheng, a hoarder specializing in Western medicine at No. 321, Hatong Building, Nanjing Road, at 4:40 pm yesterday. He stated at the time that the selling price was 130 yuan per bottle. However, Fan could not distinguish the authenticity of these tablets, so he inquired with the Yongxing Foreign Firm. After examination by Dr. Ge of the firm, it was discovered that they were all counterfeit products. He then reported to the Central Police Station, and Detective Zhou Kaiwen arrested Yang Zhenchun. After interrogation, Yang confessed that the counterfeit medicine came from Sun Yaodan, a Hangzhou native at No. 67, Lane 243, Dongyouheng Road. Sun was also arrested. Because it was necessary to investigate the manufacturing facility, he was detained for further investigation.

### Transformation Method of Prior and Posterior Heaven Trigrams, Rongwu Society's Forty-First Lecture on the Book of Changes

Yang Zhongyi of Rongwu Yijing Society's 41st Yijing Lecture, 4th term, lectured on the method of transforming the prior and posterior heaven trigrams, saying, "In the past, Xun and Kan were connected to form the Huan hexagram, a sign of the downfall of Zhou, with hundreds of millions of hearts alienated. But King Wen 'dispersed his own person' and corresponded with the ruler, though imprisoned, he was not resentful; 'dispersed his group' and served Yin with two-thirds of his people. Now, when the transformation changes, Li and Xun are connected to form the Ding hexagram, then great prosperity comes to support sages and worthies, the two elders return, where will the son go? Therefore, 'the noble person rectifies his position to solidify his destiny' and harmonizes with those above and below to receive heavenly blessings. Above there is the 'revolution of Ze Huo', below the 'new acquisition of Huo Feng'; 'double brightness and beauty, to illuminate the four directions', 'to transform and complete the world', the foundation of virtue is established. However, hope for the Dao is like not yet seeing it, then change the Kun custom to eliminate the Yin forces, also leap three trigrams to receive under Ze, above the sun, and the Dui Ze movement forms the Cui hexagram. In the past, the Dao was stripped and decayed, now 'Cui gathers', those near are pleased and those far submit; although 'remove weapons to prepare for emergencies', 'it is beneficial to have a place to go, obey the destiny of heaven, observe its gathering, and the feelings of all things can be seen'. Kan is smart and Li is bright, facing each other, gathering and organizing is effective. However, also regard the people as injured, saying that Kun people are under Dui Jin, friends enter the earth, becoming Mingyi, not inner civilization but outer gentleness, showing great difficulty, therefore, high intelligence is in the middle of the sky, harmonious and respectful, Kan worries about hiding in the north, diligent and cautious, those who are balanced in the past, are now vertical, those who are left in the past are now heading south, obeying heaven and acting according to the seasons, 'brightness emerges from the earth', 'obeying and attaching to great brightness', 'receiving great blessings', 'the aspirations of the people are approved', and then 'Feng Huo Zi Chu Jia Ren', 'the woman's position is within, the man's position is without, the righteousness of men and women is the great meaning of heaven and earth', husband and wife and family and family and family and the family is upright, and the world is settled', Guan Ju's virtue, Feng exchanges the world, the two southern kings transform, and Ru and Han are small, this is the reason why the image of the dog changes the transformation method, which is extremely simple and easy, Xun first retreats beyond three trigrams and nine lines to receive ten thousand subordinates, saying to move the wind, Kun later obeys beyond three trigrams and nine lines to settle the Li above, saying to change customs, but Kun Xun sandwiches ten thousand above and below, there is the image of Mingyi and Ding, waiting for Li to spin in the middle of the sky, the image of the anomaly Kun left and right assistants into Jin and his family, 'Li above and Kan below', 'therefore, it is accepted with Weiji to end', (note that the forty-second lecture on the essence of the doctrine of the mean has been published in the previous newspaper)

### Professional Beggars

"Sir, do a good deed, save the poor," this miserable tone can be heard at any time, whether at the tram station or on the road. The number of beggars in Shanghai now is imaginable. If a precise statistic were taken, the number would certainly be surprising.

A heart of compassion is in everyone, and being charitable is an innate norm, but in these difficult times, most people are too busy taking care of themselves to spare anything to help the endless poor. If you occasionally take out five cents to show your heart, you may sometimes see grateful eyes and hear a thank you, but sometimes, unexpectedly, because it does not satisfy their desires, you may see their contempt or hear their ridicule.

The helpless old women and difficult women, the unclothed and unfed old and weak and difficult children, the powerless disabled and the sick, this group of beggars is still worthy of our pity, and we should do our best to provide relief to fulfill the spirit of human mutual assistance. As for other "young and strong beggars" who are professional, there is really no need to help them, because helping them will only encourage their dependence. But in fact, their performance as beggars is certainly better than that of the old, weak, women, and children. Their desires are also higher than those of the old, weak, women, and children, because they know the skills of being a beggar and can grasp the psychology of donors. "Young and strong beggars" are not without the strength to seek their own way out. The reason why they are willing to become beggars is because they feel that being a beggar is easier than making a living, and being a beggar is the only shortcut to making a living. Most of them are scattered in front of restaurants, dance halls, movie theaters, or other public places, looking for their targets - donors.

Their best "patrons" are couples traveling together, because they know how much couples hate them. They also know that couples will not be too stingy in front of their lovers, and the time and words they spend will certainly be small, and the effect will certainly be great. Of course, they sometimes choose their targets from among pedestrians, saying words that please the other person, such as wishing the old lady many children and grandchildren, many blessings and long life, and saying to the young ladies, "Beautiful young ladies, be careful of the cars," and so on.

If you encounter a friend and take out a five-cent note to give to them, they may give you a contemptuous look or hear a few words of ridicule, such as "Sir, please drop one, what can five cents do?" "Keep the change for yourself!" "Five cents is simply insulting the poor!" These words make you speechless and feel that you are being nosy. (Shaobo)

### Lost and Found Ship Tickets

### Evangelism of Relieving the Poor and Sick

Yesterday, the newspaper received a letter from Mr. Shen Fengbiao calling for help for the poor and sick. We have repeatedly received letters from doctors at various charitable hospitals, who are very willing to provide free treatment to the poor and sick, which shows that the doctors are not merely good doctors, but that they have reached a level of compassion for all beings.

People's Hospital Responds First

Our hospital is purely a charitable relief hospital. It has been operating for two years and has never charged medical fees. It has 120 beds, employs resident doctors and nurses, uses electric stoves to decoct medicine, has sanitary facilities, spacious buildings, and fresh air. Take the No. 16 trolleybus from Yangjingbang directly to the hospital entrance. The hospital's monthly expenses require 17,000 yuan, which relies entirely on donations from all walks of life to maintain. However, it is not easy to obtain rice, and patients can only eat porridge. If there are poor and sick people, please verify and introduce them to our hospital for outpatient and inpatient treatment. Please also publish in your newspaper to inform the poor and sick. Wang Yimei's Free Consultation Upon reading your newspaper's Social Services column, I read the article _ 为贫病者呼 _ 文, and I, Doctor Shen Fengbiao, was very dismayed by the poverty and illness that made it impossible to treat them. I am now willing to take on the responsibility of free consultation. If they are truly poor and needy, I can also provide medicine as appropriate. Dr. Wang Yimei starts at 59 Qingdao Road, consultation time is from 10:00 am to 12:00 pm every day.

Yang Yanhe's Free Outpatient Service Since the beginning of spring, the climate has changed greatly, and the cold and warm have changed abruptly. At this difficult time, life is already very difficult, and occasional negligence and diseases are multiplied. My family has eight members, and the number of patients a month ago has reached five. Although treatment does not require consultation fees, the cost of Chinese and Western medicines has been quite high. Fortunately, they have all recovered. After being pleased, I read Mr. Shen Fengbiao's "Call for the Poor and Sick" and could not help but express my sympathy. I am willing to provide completely free consultation from 6:00 pm to 7:00 pm every night. For house calls, a fare will be charged (only for the poor and sick, and not more than 10), to indicate a limit. Yang Yanhe, 80 Anshun Lane, Kangti Road.

### Public Debt Short Selling is on the Rise

The off-market public debt market was still bearish yesterday, and it still used a consistent policy, but it was just a matter of moving flowers and grafting trees, which slightly confused people's minds. However, yesterday's short sellers, in addition to still being on the same original path, the followers were really too _ 湧, so excluding that path, the short sellers on the surface were already too crowded. When the previous path is cleared, there will be a fierce reaction. Yesterday, the seller was led by Xinyuan, followed by Tongkang, and then Hongxing, with a total of about one million. However, Tongli, Yongchang Lianyi, and others had 600,000 to 700,000 to cover their short positions. Gongmao and Zhou Guoji bought more than 200,000 of Type E, and the rest were Shunli, Jiufeng, Hongda, Qingcheng, Hefeng, Dazhong, and others, who were all selling following the trend. However, Yuxing, Qianyi, Shuntai, Tongyuan, Fuhua, Tongshun, Zhenhua, and others all bought in. Moreover, Dakangcheng first sold and then bought in, and even bought more than 100,000 of Type Ding. Type A plummeted by three yuan, as Tongkang sold a small amount. Because the previous path was repeatedly selling, the various gangs were gradually infected. Once the previous path withdrew, there would be an amazing reaction, because the market price should not have fallen so much. The market price ended up continuing to fall, from several angles to one yuan and two angles, but the biggest drop was three yuan for Type A. The turnover was about 1.3 million to 1.4 million yuan. A simple table is listed below.

At the same time, raw materials were scarce and sentiment was positive. 42-count Blue Phoenix traded at $10,150 to $10,600. 80-count Rainbow Ball traded at $27,600. 60-count Bull Head traded at $19,600. 40-count Golden City traded at $9,850. 60-count Sunlight traded at $20,700. 32-count Immortal Peach traded at $8,550. 40-count Golden Bridge traded at $8,850. 32-count Blue Phoenix traded at $8,500. 32-count Songlu traded at $8,200. 20-count Yueqin traded at $5,150 to $5,230. 20-count Fengnian traded at $5,400. 20-count Shuiyue traded at $5,500. 20-count Sunlight traded at $5,580. 20-count Shuangma traded at $5,050. 20-count Wufu traded at $4,650. 18-count Weaver traded at $5,050 to $5,100. 16-count Red Kui Xing traded at $5,000. 16-count Earth traded at $5,000. 10-count Red Change Horse traded at $4,000 to $4,150. 10-count Red Bao Yi traded at $3,730 to $3,800. The initial asking price for single 20-count Shuangma factory yarn opened at $4,030. Due to large orders being placed, buying interest was strong, driving the price up to $4,190. After some fluctuation, and with many short positions approaching settlement, the upward trend intensified, reaching $4,310. After the close, prices eased slightly to $4,280.

### Piece Goods Become Even Scarcer

Cloth: Yesterday, with yarn prices continuing to rise, cloth supplies became even tighter. Asking prices reached new highs. 16-pound Double Elephant sheeting opened at $250, but spot goods were lacking. Earth coarse cloth traded at $225 in the morning, but no sales were reported in the afternoon. 12-pound Earth fine cloth rose to $202. Dapeng traded at $200. Fugui traded at $190. Blue cloth and poplin were even more scarce, with holders hoarding and demanding high prices.

Eastern cloth initially remained flat before rising, continuing its upward trend. The new order price for 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth opened at $238.50 in the morning, falling to $237, then rising again to $239. In the afternoon, it reached $239.50, opening higher to $243, and closing at $240.50, a gain of $3.50. Trading in old stock orders, spot goods, and miscellaneous lower-grade brands was very active, with prices rising rapidly. Dragon Head old orders traded at $220. Rainbow Ball fine cloth saw a new price of $219. Four Gentlemen serge yellow orders closed at $7.32, and red orders with new tax closed at $7.34.

### Woolens Expensive and Scarce

Yesterday, Good China 222 white straight tribute woolen cloth was selling for $245 per yard. Fengyu white beiji traded at $190. Ewo 129 weak yarn traded at $130. Most of the local Xuanwei woolen cloth and ordinary suit woolen cloth were sold for $170 to $200. 36-inch white canvas sold for $15. Yousheng rainproof cloth traded at $20. French-made lining retailed for over $4. Fair soft lining retailed for $6.50. Since the beginning of spring this year, woolen cloth prices have been rising all the way, with purchasing power generally considered weak. However, retail and wholesale trading remained active. Although sellers were unwilling to sell, intentionally setting high prices, transactions still occurred. This kind of strange market situation is indeed rare.

### Bean Cake Country Sales Active

Yesterday, retail sales of miscellaneous grains continued to be active, but due to slow movement procedures, transactions were still not very strong. The market trend was stable with a slight upward bias. Overall, soybeans, corn, and sesame were all considered stable. Bean cake prices rose by $2-3 due to active rural sales. Transactions included 146 bags of Tianjin Jinyuan at $230, 20 bags of Pudong Duzhou at $225, 30 bags of Pinghu Duzhou at $223, two cartloads of Wuhu corn at $143, 200 bags of Yangzhuang white sesame at $320, 600 pieces of Yuanlong bean cake for November delivery at $45.70, one cartload of Qingzhong cake at $39, and 5,500 pieces of Xingji bean cake for April delivery at $53 to $55.20, and 500 pieces of old May delivery at $48.

### Domestic Rice Little Fluctuation

Although the weather turned sunny, the number of peddlers from the suburbs was still unusually low due to the heavy rains in the past few days. It was reported that the asking prices for domestic rice yesterday were unwilling to drop, with few buyers. Early and late rice remained at $433 to $430 in the French Concession and $450 in the British Concession, with little fluctuation.

### Candles and Soap Downstream, Matches Rebound

The selling prices of daily necessities such as soap remained difficult to stimulate and continued to decline, as buying and selling lacked interest, resulting in a market with few buyers. Gu Ben soap traded at $310 per box, Huangxiangmao soap traded at $280, Baixiangmao soap traded at $300, and Arrowhead soap traded at $285, unchanged from before, with prices remaining stable. Matches rebounded after a sharp drop, as sellers saw that the source of raw materials in the future was not easy, and the factory had no news of supply. Market inventories were bound to decrease day by day, leading to a recovery. Phoenix brand traded at $5,600 per box, Beauty brand traded at $5,800, and miscellaneous brands traded at $5,500, an increase of $300 from before. The situation for foreign candles was difficult to improve, as restrictions were strict and buying and selling stopped, causing prices to trend downstream. White Lacey traded at $165 and Sengmao traded at $160, both down $10 per box (i.e., 25 packages).

### Cigarette Tax Increase, Hoarding Resumes

The cigarette market was difficult to rise or fall, as sales were still unable to stabilize. This was because searches were strict and prices in various villages also fell, so vendors disappeared. The stimulus of the tax increase on sentiment had not yet been eliminated, and large-scale hoarders watched and were unwilling to sell cheaply. General retail hoarding absorption was quite strong, resulting in a stalemate in the market. British Brand traded at $9,700 per box, Old Knife Brand traded at $8,700, Pin Hai Brand traded at $5,900, Little Fairy Brand traded at $5,620, Five Hua Brand traded at $5,500, Japanese Tobacco Gold Gun Brand traded at $2,450, Gold Building traded at $2,550, Red Rose Brand traded at $1,900, All Green Brand traded at $2,830, Twenty-stick All Green Brand traded at $1,350. Japanese tobacco was slightly better, while prices for other brands remained flat.

### Rayon Rises Again

Yesterday, the rayon market showed an upward trend again. 120 Sky Bridge shiny small boxes opened at $9,050, then fell back to $9,010, but prices remained high. Following the trend of buying military bonds, prices rose to $9,100, with buyers following suit and the market showing uniform prosperity. At the close, the price was $9,150, a sharp increase of $370 from the previous day. 75 Golden Kite semi-gloss small boxes saw renewed activity, rising directly to $8,650 amidst strong buying. 120 Golden Kite semi-gloss large boxes traded at $9,000, with the market trend being strong and gradually rising. Asking prices opened at $9,200, and transactions were heard at $9,100.

### Longan (4)

— Gao Jiannong

Longan has been "enslaved" for over a thousand years. Now that it has found a friend who understands and speaks for it, clearing its name, how could it not rise to prominence immediately? Secondly, reputation cannot be attained by luck alone; it must be matched by reality. In this regard, Huang Shao-xu, in his "Cultivation Methods for Tropical Fruit Trees," states: "Among longan varieties, the ones produced in Fuxinghua are the best... In the market, the longan from Xinghua is considered the legitimate descendant, hence specifically called 'Xinghua Round,' while others are collectively called 'Miscellaneous Road Round.' Miscellaneous Road longan are mostly left to grow wild in overgrown areas, uncultivated and subject to natural selection. Xinghua Round is different: superior cultivation and good manufacturing are beyond the reach of Miscellaneous Road Round!" Now, it is probably clear why Xinghua longan is so famous.

As for the meaning of the two characters "longan," Li Shizhen bluntly stated, "It's pictographic!"—although I don't know who has actually seen a dragon?—In addition, there are also names like "dragon's eye," "yi zhi," "litchi slave," and "pearl," names rich in poetic color, but the most common is "gui yuan." As for the name "litchi slave," Ji Han explained it very clearly, simply because its ripening period "usually follows after it." There was no comparison of its color, aroma, and taste with litchi. However, later generations made such comments as, "The core is large, the flesh is thin... after eating litchi to one's fill, one cannot bear to chew...—from "Quanzhou Miscellaneous Records"—"Eating it fresh is far inferior to litchi; it is truly fit to be a slave!"—from "Agricultural Administration Complete Book"—"The taste is also sweet, but with a slight grassy flavor, far inferior in elegance to litchi, hence it is called litchi slave."—from "Wutong Miscellaneous Jade"—: contrived criticisms. In fact, each thing has its strengths and weaknesses, and one should say, as Zhuangzi did, "Sour pears, oranges, and pomelos, their tastes are opposite, but all are acceptable to the mouth." Why bother to be so fastidious and make such unnecessary comparisons? (To be continued)

### Chen Yunshang in Western Eyes

— Yu Yi

A Western reporter named Dark Crews recently visited "China's Movie Queen" Chen Yunshang at her residence. Upon his return, he wrote a short piece, praising the simplicity of Chen Yunshang's private life. Here is an excerpt:

"China's Movie Queen, Chen Yunshang, is the idol worshipped by millions of moviegoers, attracting attention and being surrounded everywhere. Her fame is unmatched. However, strangely enough, her private life is exceptionally simple, which may be the secret to her success.

She lives with her frail and sickly mother and younger sister in a quiet area of the French Concession. In front of her residence is a small lawn, sparsely decorated with flowers and trees, providing tranquility amidst the noise. On a sunny afternoon in April in Shanghai, the reporter spent half a day chatting with the 'China's Movie Queen' in this courtyard. The garden was bathed in golden sunlight, the roses were beautiful and vibrant, and the willow branches brushed against our faces, making us feel relaxed and enchanted.

In people's imaginations, the life of a movie star must be very luxurious. However, all aspects of Chen Yunshang's private life are very simple. Her residence only has a living room connected to a dining room, without a library or reception room. The furniture is modern, painted milky white. The only luxurious decoration is a large grand piano covered with a Vienna floral carpet. In the dining room, there is a vase of daffodils, which is changed every morning, showing her love for flowers.

As for the choice of clothing, it is also very simple. Among all the films she has starred in, only one has required her to change into a new outfit in every scene (Note: This may refer to 'New Sisters Flower'). However, she said that she does not feel the pleasure of changing into new outfits, but rather finds it troublesome. In her residence, there is a large wardrobe with dozens of outfits, many of which come from the United States. However, she does not often 'rummage through her wardrobe' unless it is necessary. Usually, she applies light makeup, and her natural beauty is charming. Her black cloud-like hair hangs down her shoulders, like other modern girls, and her bright eyes are full of vitality. When she first met the reporter, she was a bit shy, but when she offered tea to her guests, she was completely at ease.

Chen Yunshang's English name is Nancy. During the conversation, her attitude was natural and her eloquence was fluent. She said that she has been in Shanghai for six years. Before, she had acted in several films in Hong Kong, showing some talent. After entering the Shanghai film circle, she became famous in one fell swoop. She has always loved acting, and she no longer considers acting as a job. Her life can be said to be very happy. However, she also has two hardships. One is that she does not have gasoline and cannot use a car to travel. The other is that because she has gained the love of the audience, she has indirectly been deprived of her freedom to walk on the streets.

Now, she always rides a bicycle to the studio for work. Fortunately, the studio is on Haig Road, which is close to her residence, so traveling back and forth is not very troublesome. She also has a hobby, which is to go to large companies to buy some things she loves. Before, when she had a car, she could hide in the car and not be afraid of being surrounded by passersby. Now, it is not easy to travel safely, because riding a bicycle to buy things in the central district often causes a commotion when she is recognized by other customers, and she cannot break out of the encirclement without the intervention of the police. Therefore, in addition to answering fan letters, her secretary now buys things for her.

The reporter was a guest at her residence and talked for half a day. Before we knew it, the sun was setting and twilight was approaching. It was not convenient to stay any longer. I bid farewell and left. When she opened the door to say goodbye, she smiled sweetly, and that impression still lingers in my mind."

### Chen Yunshang's Reclusive Life at Home

### Feng Zihe is Dead

— Bing Jiu

Feng Chunhang, a famous early southern actor, whose stage name was Zihe, came to Shanghai from Qingdao before the war. Living expenses were a concern. He relied on income from teaching students to cover expenses. Later, through a friend's recommendation, he obtained a screenwriting position with Huang Jin and also became a teacher at a drama school, providing enough to support his family. Two years ago, he performed the old "Red Silk Embroidery" in a charity performance. At sixty, the old man still put on makeup as a woman, and although his appeal was not weak, the situation was pitiful. In recent years, the cost of living has risen sharply, and Feng's income was limited, which made him increasingly anxious. He suffered from neurasthenia and was bedridden for several months, succumbing to poverty and illness, and passing away on the ninth of this month. The funeral was simple, arranged by friends such as Zhou Xinfang. A generation of artists has passed away, and another old actor is gone.

Feng Zihe studied with Xia Yueshan in his youth and was skilled in tragic female roles. The early Republic of China was his peak period. His self-written works, "Feng Xiaoqing," "Tearful Monument," and "Red Silk Embroidery," were emotionally moving and considered masterpieces. He performed with Sun Juxian, which enhanced his fame. At that time, Jia Biyun was also in Shanghai, and their skills were comparable. Drama critics praised their individual strengths, causing heated debates and the formation of rival factions. The leader of the Feng faction was Liu Yazi, and the leader of the Jia faction was Feng Shuqi. Both men had sharp writing skills. Initially, they discussed dramatic arts, but later they resorted to insults. Young and energetic, they were motivated by a desire to win and did not hesitate to put it in writing. Both men should regret their good deeds in the past when they think about it today. In fact, Feng Jia's skills had their own merits, and there was no need for a clear dispute.

After Feng Zihe performed for a short time, he stopped singing due to obesity. He then worked for the Railway Bureau and never returned to the stage. When he came to Shanghai again, he was already old. Zihe was eccentric and liked to be a teacher, but he did not care about tuition fees. Zhao Junyu once treated Zihe with the etiquette of a teacher. On the first day of teaching, Zihe said to him, "I do not make a living by teaching art, but I choose people to teach, and I do not seek reward. Your talent is better than others, and you can become a famous actor in the future." His vision and temperament can be seen. Recognizing that most actors are illiterate, he created a volunteer school and taught it himself without taking a penny. This righteous act is still praised by people in the acting world.

A drama magazine once published an anecdote about Feng: When Zihe was studying with Xia Yueshan, Yueshan accidentally beat him for other reasons, which was not his fault. Zihe was furious and rushed to visit the abbot of a temple, asking to become a monk. The monks saw that the tears in his eyes had not yet dried, and knew that he was temporarily angry after being wronged. They did not grant his request and comforted him with kind words. Soon, Yueshan stopped him and persuaded him to stop. His stubborn temper was like this.

### "Kiddie Kavalry" to be Released — Laurel and Hardy's New Work —

Laurel and Hardy, recruited by Fox at a high price, completed a new work named Gieat Guns in October of last year. The film arrived in Shanghai in November of last year, two or three weeks before the outbreak of the Pacific War. It is said that Asia Company is scheduled to premiere it in the Grand Theater on the 19th of this month, and translated the name to "Kiddie Kavalry." In this source of western films being exhausted, the premiere of "Kiddie Kavalry" will definitely attract the attention of Shanghai film fans, and the film is not only full of jokes, but also the greatness of the scenes and the tension of the plot, which exceeds the previous works of the two.

### Operetta Performed at Lyceum Theatre

— Yi Qing

Operetta has not yet occupied a considerable position in the eyes of Chinese people. Of course, this is because the general level of music is too poor. In recent years, culture has advanced rapidly, especially in Shanghai, which is becoming more and more Westernized! Of course, the advantages of others are worthy of emulation. Observing the performance of the Russian opera troupe at the Grand Theater, which has been full of seats for days, with Chinese audiences accounting for the majority, it can be seen that Chinese people have also developed a great interest in operetta.

At the corner of Nash Road and Route Cardinal Mercier, there is an Eastern palace of art — the Lyceum Theatre. Its architecture is very suitable for the principles of performing arts. Each performance of famous people and famous plays mostly uses this palace of beauty as a performance venue. Its owner is British, and under his leadership, he organized a Russian-style opera troupe, named ADC (Amateur Dramatic Club), which has performed grand operas at the Lyceum for many years and achieved great results. Westerners have flocked to watch the performances, and they have been highly praised by all walks of life.

In the near future, this troupe will have another large-scale performance. This rehearsal has been going on for months, and there are many programs, and the excitement can be imagined. On the day of the trial performance, the author visited the backstage and saw the actors were putting on makeup. All the costumes and props are as beautiful as possible. It has now been decided that performances will be held at the Lyceum Theatre every day from the 21st to the 25th of this month at 5:30 in the afternoon.

### Anecdotes of Pear Garden Figures

— Written by Zheng Guoyi, Designed by Zhang Yizhang, Section of Female Performers

(Fifteen) Wu Suqiu

Wu Suqiu was originally a student of the Opera School, but dropped out midway and did not graduate. Therefore, her stage name does not use the seniority of the "De" and "Yu" characters set by the Opera School, and she does not recognize herself as a student of the Opera School. After leaving the school, I heard that she had studied with Shang Xiaoyun, and after carefully distinguishing her singing voice, it does have a vague resemblance. This may be true. Suqiu is quick-witted and outstanding. She can open up her mind when performing. Although she imitates Xiaoyun, she does not have to completely conform to Xiaoyun. Therefore, she knows how to avoid all the places where Xiaoyun is considered to have problems and is not contaminated. Although the skill she has achieved is far away from Xiaoyun and cannot be compared with Xiaoyun, it can be said that she is better than blue in this respect. She is also the female disciple of Gou Huisheng (some say she is his goddaughter), so she also performs many of Huisheng's new plays. She is usually good at socializing, lively and lovely on stage, and her beauty is something that other female performers can hardly match. Therefore, due to the sensation caused by the play of spinning cotton, she has consolidated her position. Almost among the female performers, she can be considered one of the most popular. However, if you say that her popularity is entirely due to the play of spinning cotton, that is also superficial talk, because she has all the above-mentioned tools to win. Even if she does not perform spinning cotton, I am afraid that the female performers of the time would have to let her take the lead.

### The King of Songs: A Brief Biography of Schubert

— By An Jun

In the program of the first meeting of the Li's Regular Concert, there was a piece called "Unfinished Symphony." Its composer was the renowned "King of Songs"—Franz Peter Schubert. Presumably, every music-loving lady and gentleman is very familiar with him. Now, let's revisit his life and deeds as a mere embellishment.

Generally speaking, people with innate intelligence and special talents often come from poor families and inevitably have some quirks. Schubert was precisely like this. He was born in 1797 AD and had a special talent for music. Although his family was very poor, his father was a music teacher, so he was able to guide his own son. At the age of eight, Schubert entered a church school. At the age of eleven, he wore nearsighted glasses. Despite not having high aptitude for academics, he left school at the age of seventeen. He was very popular and had a group of people who supported him as their leader. They often used music for leisure and practiced "selflessness." They were very optimistic about everything, and others called them the "Schubert Party." Schubert could compose quickly anytime, anywhere. When he was pondering in a restaurant, waiters would hand him a stack of menus for him to write music on the back. For example, after reading Goethe's poem "The Erlking," he immediately composed a very awe-inspiring "Erlking Song" in ten minutes. In his lifetime, he composed more than a thousand songs, and people called him the "King of Songs."

At that time, Schubert greatly admired the contemporary great musician Beethoven. He often imitated him in some places, so some people called him "Little Beethoven." However, Schubert was short in stature and very shy, with some feminine mannerisms, so some people ridiculed him by calling him "Female Beethoven." Because he was afraid of embarrassment, although he often wanted to visit Beethoven, he didn't have the courage to do so, always thinking that his talent was inferior to him. Later, after much persuasion from a group of friends, he carefully selected sixty songs to take with him, but when he went, Beethoven had just gone out and they did not meet. Later, Beethoven returned home and soon fell ill. While browsing books during his illness, he discovered these musical works and was greatly amazed, asking people to invite him over. When Schubert arrived, Beethoven was already in his dying state, and in his last breath, they finally became "Friends of Music." The year after Beethoven's death, Schubert also passed away, and his tomb is next to Beethoven's tomb. He died in 1828, at the young age of thirty-one.

### Sharing the Same Boat in Storms

— By He Jia Zhi

(3) A Guest Arrives

Fei Changhe was taken aback and retracted his rolling pin, saying, "Who is it?" A Xing said, "Young Master Ye is here." Wei Cheng had no angry expression at all, nodding to Changhe and saying, "How do you do?" Fei Changhe immediately flattened his raised eyebrows. He pushed the tilted copper basin hat on his head, making it even more tilted. An unnatural, forced smile appeared on his face. When Cuizhen saw that it was Wei Cheng, she hurriedly called out, "Brother Cheng, how did you come? It's cold, and it's night." Wei Cheng said, "I heard people say that something happened at your house tonight. What happened?" Fei Changhe interjected, "Nothing happened. I drank some wine, and I just had that old temper, liking to speak frankly to my niece. Young Master Ye, who picked up a wheat stalk and used it as an arrow of authority to report to Young Master Ye? Cuizhen, Young Master Ye is here, aren't you going to boil some water to make tea?" Cuizhen said, "Okay." She brushed past Wei Cheng, went to a room on the east side, put a hand on her chest, and shook it at Wei Cheng. Her hand gesture was only for Wei Cheng to see, not for others to see.

Wei Cheng was still full of anger. He walked over, picked up the rolling pin, looked at it, and said, "Isn't this for hitting people? Fei Changhe! You don't have to hide it from me. You have some dissatisfaction with your niece. What is it for?" Fei Changhe picked up the rolling pin, let it lie on the ground, and said, "The rolling pin is for rolling dough, not for hitting people. Even if it hits someone, it's just hitting my niece, hitting my daughter, hitting my wife. It hasn't hit anyone of Young Master Ye's. I say, that person who reports trivial matters as serious ones is the worst kind of person. We can't have such people." Wei Cheng said, "You can't say that. I, surnamed Ye, certainly can't interfere with the affairs of your family, surnamed Fei, but you and I live in the same village. If you unreasonably hit someone, or coerce someone to hand over something to you, or cause trouble while drunk, or bully others by relying on your power, we, the people living in the same village, can all report it to the district office, report it to the public security bureau, to seek safety for the people of the village, to eliminate the scum. This is a matter of inescapable duty, Fei Changhe!"

Fei Changhe's wife complained to Fei Changhe, "I said long ago that scholars are not to be trifled with. They have a belly full of ink." Fei Changhe glared at his wife and said, "Woman, it's not your turn to speak! Go and call Cuizhen here and ask her if I hit her. If I hit her, then let me be punished tonight, the arm that hit her will break as soon as I fall asleep." Fei Changhe made this solemn oath, and Cuizhen peeked out from the east room and said, "Brother Cheng, don't misunderstand. My uncle didn't hit me. He is very fond of me." Wei Cheng said, "He is very fond of you?" Cuizhen nodded, tears already streaming down, and said, "Yes." He Zixing, watching from the side, felt sad and tugged at Wei Cheng's sleeve, saying, "Young Master, didn't the Second Madam ask Young Master to invite Miss Cuizhen to stay at our house for a while?" Wei Cheng didn't say anything, and Fei Changhe hurriedly said, "That's good too. I'm already so poor that I'm about to die. It's good to have one less person to feed." (53)
