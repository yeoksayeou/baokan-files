Furthermore, the main force of the Japanese troops, having captured Wenzhou, continued to expand their gains along the Ou River.

Zhejiang Front, 15th, Special Dispatch from the Allied News Agency: According to消息 received here, the Japanese navy is closely coordinating with the army in a large-scale campaign in the Wenzhou area, including the Ou River and the Feiyun River. On July 5th, Japanese naval aircraft bombed military installations in Wenzhou and Yueqing.

On the 9th and 10th, Japanese naval aircraft attacked Rui'an and Pingyang, hitting 34 defensive installations. Furthermore, Japanese naval vessels have cleared mines around Wenzhou and have been shelling nearby fortresses since the 5th.

According to a report from the Allied News Agency: Japanese troops suddenly initiated actions from the Lishui area on July 7th, and within ten days, successively captured Wenzhou and Rui'an. During this period, the Japanese naval air force continuously bombed Wenzhou to assist the army's advance. Specifically, on July 5th, they raided Wenzhou, destroying two warehouses and 22 military facilities. On the 6th, they bombed Wenzhou and Leqing again, destroying 20 military facilities. On the 7th, they further damaged 17 important facilities in Pingyang and Gu'ao Tou (Ao River), causing large fires everywhere. On the 8th, they raided Rui'an and Gu'ao Tou, destroying ten military facilities. On the 9th and 10th, they bombed military facilities in Gu'ao Tou, Pingyang, Rui'an, and other places, destroying 34 facilities. Especially during the air raid on Gu'ao Tou, a bomb hit a fuel depot, causing a large fire and significant damage. At the same time, naval rapid assault units were also dispatched to sweep the sea (Wenzhou-Shatou waterway), and operations are still ongoing. On the 10th, Chongqing troops on Wenzhou Island suddenly opened fire with field artillery on the minesweeping team, which was then returned by the Japanese. On the 11th, boats opening waterways on the Feiyun River were used to detonate and clear the mines released into the Feiyun River one by one. The waterway opening team also cleared waterways on the Fuchun River, removing mines near Yangxia Bu on the 6th. In addition, before and after the capture of Wenzhou, the Japanese naval forces inspected a total of 19,975 ships and sailing vessels.

### Foreign Minister Togo Expresses: Japan-Soviet Relations Remain Unchanged

Tokyo, 15th, Special Dispatch from the Allied News Agency: At the opening ceremony of a branch of the Japan Economic Federation held at the New Osaka Hotel this afternoon, Foreign Minister Togo stated in his address that the Soviet Union had assured Japan that the recently concluded Anglo-Soviet Treaty and the Soviet-American Agreement did not contain provisions relating to Japan. Togo reiterated that Soviet-Japanese relations still depend on the neutrality treaty between the two countries.

Togo continued, "Since the outbreak of the Soviet-German war, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union have only cooperated with each other to the extent that their interests coincide. The Anglo-Soviet Treaty and the Soviet-American Agreement should be examined from this point of view. The United States and the United Kingdom attempt to use the Soviet Union, while the Soviet Union relies on British and American aid to conduct the war against Germany. The Anglo-American front accepts the Soviet Union's urgent need for armaments and materials to cope with the German offensive, and in return, the Soviet Union accepts the Atlantic Charter and guarantees not to negotiate a separate peace. Otherwise, neither side has any other way to deal with Germany. Regarding this point, enemy countries are spreading propaganda in an attempt to alienate Japan and the Soviet Union. At the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, the United States and the United Kingdom publicized a plan for a long-term war, completing war preparations within three years and then launching an all-out offensive. However, in these countries, there has been much debate recently, saying that this year is the most critical period, and the general trend of the war will be determined during this period. Judging from the signs, they are now earnestly providing the Soviet Union with greater assistance and talking about establishing a second front in Europe. As for the East, they strongly advocate aiding Chongqing and Australia, and defending India. What is even more noticeable is that they are now planning a counter-offensive against Japan. This change in attitude reflects their impatience due to repeated defeats in East Asia. The development of the war is extremely favorable to the Axis powers. As for the Chongqing regime, since the Burma Road was cut off, it has fallen into extremely serious difficulties, but it has not realized the history and changes in the East Asian situation, or its mission as a member of the East Asian nations, and still relies on the United Kingdom and the United States, continuing a futile war of resistance against Japan, which is extremely regrettable. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Japan's position has been "稳磐石" [as stable as a rock]. There is not the slightest doubt about Japan's victory, as it is fighting for a just cause," he said.

### Indian National Congress Resolution: Demands Britain Return Political Power, Allows Indians to Establish Provisional Government and Maintain Friendly Relations with Britain

Lisbon, 14th, Special Dispatch from the Allied News Agency: According to a report from New Delhi, the Executive Committee of the All-India National Congress Party, which recently met in Wardha, passed a resolution on the 14th, demanding that British political forces withdraw from India and that Indians establish a provisional government. It also expressed its determination to take resistance measures if the British refuse this request. The main points of the resolution are as follows: "We demand that British forces withdraw from India. This does not mean that British troops and British nationals should withdraw, but that Britain should hand over political power to us. If Britain accepts this, then the Indians will establish their own provisional government, and will maintain friendly relations with Britain in the future. If Britain refuses, then the Congress Party, in order to defend the freedom and rights of the Indian people, will take non-violent resistance measures under the leadership of Gandhi. As for the establishment of the Indian provisional government, representatives from all strata of India will be recruited, and a constitutional amendment committee will be set up first to formulate a constitution acceptable to the Indian government and all strata of India." It is reported that this proposal will be submitted to the All-India Congress Party Committee to be held in Bombay on August 7 for final approval.

Lisbon, 15th, Special Dispatch from the Allied News Agency: According to a report from Wardha, India, Gandhi will address the All-India National Congress Party Committee meeting in Bombay on August 7. The Executive Committee of the Congress Party will meet again in Bombay on August 4 and for several days thereafter, until the All-India Committee convenes. At the same time, when Gandhi was interviewed by new reporters and asked how a free India would operate, Gandhi replied that what was about to happen was that if the British withdrew, India would change and there would be no disturbance. Responsible wise men will gather in the future to form a provisional government. When asked how he envisioned a mixed provisional government, Gandhi claimed that after the withdrawal, all parties would automatically dissolve, and the National Congress Party would be no exception. New parties may be formed or the original parties may still be active, but they will supplement each other and operate in different ways. When asked if he would fast if he was imprisoned, Gandhi replied that he would never want to invite imprisonment, but if he were dragged into prison, it would be another matter. Of course, he could fast, as he had fasted before.

Bombay, 15th, Hawas News Agency: Jinnah, Chairman of the All-India Muslim League, issued a statement today, severely criticizing Mahatma Gandhi's concept of Indian independence. He said, "What we want is the independence of Hindus, Muslims, and all other ethnic groups in India. What Gandhi is asking for is only the independence of the Congress Party."

### German Forces Strive for Time Advantage, Eager to Control Ukraine, Southern German Forces Approach Rostov, Fierce Fighting in Voroshilovgrad

Berlin, 14th, Special Dispatch from the Allied News Agency: Southern German forces have broken through the Soviet positions at Kharkov and Kursk. It is difficult for the Soviet army to stop the fierce German offensive. Combining various sources of information, German mechanized units heading south from Kharkov have broken through the Lisichansk position and are advancing towards Voroshilovgrad. German forces advancing east from Kharkov have occupied Pokrovske and are continuing to advance towards Stalingrad, a key point on the Volga River. German forces occupying Voronezh have not made much progress.

Stockholm, Sweden, 15th, Hawas News Agency: A report from Berlin states that the spearhead units of the German armored divisions are now only eight miles from the Don River fortress of Rostov. General Kleist's forces advanced to the line between Stalin and Taganrog two or three days ago, apparently reaching Lovinki, 70 miles east of Taganrog to the north, and near Sinjawaska, at the tip of Taganrog to the south.

Berlin, 15th, Hawas News Agency: The Supreme Command announced this morning that the German forces on the Eastern Front are now rapidly advancing, and the enemy's rearguard units have been defeated or annihilated by our advance units. Our air force continues to bomb the enemy's retreating army and [night] Rostov. The Red Army launched a fierce attack on the Voronezh bridgehead position, but was eventually repulsed after fierce fighting. Thirty-eight Red Army tanks were destroyed. At the same time, [square] troops and tank units were annihilated. The enemy forces surrounded northwest of Voronezh destroyed 125 Red Army plans.

Somewhere on the border of Ukraine, 14th, Hawas News Agency: German forces have been consolidating their positions on the southern route of the Eastern Front in recent days and are carrying out mopping-up operations in order to eliminate the remaining enemy forces, so their offensive has slowed down. Many Red Army units have lost contact and have been scattered into isolated forces, but they are still continuing to resist behind the German lines. The German Supreme Command apparently wants to eliminate the Red Army's centers of resistance before taking new strategic actions. However, German forces are still exerting significant pressure on the entire front line, that is, on the 600-mile-long line from Voronezh to the Sea of Azov. In certain places, the Red Army's defense line has been broken through, so there is no clear front line between the two sides. German armored units, under the cover of artillery fire, attacked Voroshilovgrad yesterday. Yesterday morning, some German tanks had reached the suburbs of the city and engaged in fierce fighting with the Red Army. At the same time, Soviet war reports also admitted that the Red Army was forced to withdraw from the eastern part of Lisichansk, but did not specify where it had retreated to. According to the German side, a small town 41 miles east of Lisichansk is already in German hands. As for what progress the German forces have made in the Donets River basin, the German side [keeps] it secret, because the Eastern Front has fallen into chaos with no clear front line. Even in the Red Army's Supreme Command, they do not know where their troops are fighting. Under these circumstances, any news released by the German side regarding the development of the war will only benefit the Red Army's General Staff. However, according to private sources, the German offensive in the Vegitovka area was successful again, and they occupied the Soviet mining center of Talpalkhivo city last night. In addition, in the Taganrog area, the Red Army launched a large-scale counter-offensive under the cover of naval artillery fire. The outcome is still unknown, but this move is enough to contain the German forces and temporarily postpone the attack on Rostov. Neutral observers commented on the war situation, saying that the strength of the German forces is strong and has not been weakened by the war last winter. The Red Army failed to prepare early enough to deal with German strategy based on the lessons of the war in the summer and autumn of last year, which was a mistake. According to semi-official Soviet sources, the Red Army's retreat this time was not only due to the fact that its equipment [loss] was inferior to that of the German army, but also because General Timoshenko did not want the Red Army to be surrounded by the German army, and would rather order a retreat, so the Red Army's retreat was prepared in advance, with the rearguard covering the retreat in an orderly manner. In short, from the recent battles, it can be seen that the purpose of the German Supreme Command is to strive for the time factor. If Hitler cannot end the war on the Eastern Front before next winter, he at least wants to completely control the fertile farmland of Ukraine in the shortest possible time.

German Forces Mass on the East Bank of the Don River, Situation in Voronezh Tense

Moscow, 15th, Hawas News Agency: Pravda reported this morning that the situation in the Voronezh area is extremely critical.

Moscow, 15th, Hawas News Agency: The Soviet Information Bureau announced today, "Last night, our units fought to the death with the enemy in the Voronezh area, and launched a counter-offensive in a certain area, repelling the enemy. Fighting south of Buguchan City is still ongoing. There are no major changes in other areas."

Soviet Union Fully Defending Moscow, Fierce Fighting in the Kalinin Region

Lisbon, 14th, Special Dispatch from the Allied News Agency: According to a report from TASS, Moscow, fierce fighting broke out in the Kalinin region, northwest of Moscow, on the Eastern Front at 2:00 PM today. Soviet troops are currently fighting desperately against the German forces.

Tokyo, 15th, Meat in the thorn Allied News Agency: This "Nichinichi Shimbun" recently published a special dispatch from the capital of Switzerland, stating that, according to Reuters, London, the fighting in the Kalinin region northwest of Moscow has become even fiercer since 1:00 PM, and it is reported that the German forces have advanced to the location they previously captured in the middle of last year, which is located northwest of Moscow, only 90 kilometers away.

Berlin, 15th, Haitong News Agency: German officials said yesterday that in the fighting in the Erzhev area in the central sector of the Eastern Front, German losses were less than one-tenth of Soviet losses. In addition to the 30,000 prisoners of war previously announced, tens of thousands of more prisoners of war have fallen into German hands.

### Egyptian Front: Skirmishes Continue Throughout the Night, Both Sides' Air Forces Are Exceptionally Active

Cairo, 15th, Hawas News Agency: The Middle East Command announced this morning that there was no fighting on the northern route of the Egyptian front. It was not until last night that enemy troops and infantry began to attack our outpost line at Tel El Eissa. The fighting continued throughout the night. There were only small-scale skirmishes on the central and southern routes. Our light bombers and fighter planes continued to attack enemy positions. Many enemy tanks and troop carriers were destroyed. During one attack, several enemy armored vehicles and troop carriers, and one tank were almost completely bombed. Only four aircraft were shot down by our fighters. Last night, our medium bombers concentrated their attacks on Tobruk Harbor, causing a large fire.

Rome, 15th, Hawas News Agency: The Italian Supreme Command announced today that enemy troops on the southern route of the Egyptian front sent a large number of scouts to attack, but were repulsed by our army. Our main air force attacked enemy concentrations east of El Alamein. As a result of several air battles, nine British aircraft were shot down by our aircraft and four were shot down by German aircraft.

Somewhere on the Egyptian border, 14th, Hawas News Agency: The fighting on the Egyptian front remained calm today, with only small-scale fighting near El Alamein. The German army mobilized a large number of infantry on the previous day, and used a large number of tanks as aid, to attack the northern end of the Allied defense line, but was eventually repulsed. On the southern section of the front, the Axis forces have taken a defensive posture since occupying the British outpost station on the edge of the Qattara Depression on the 12th of this month. General Rommel, commander of the Axis forces in North Africa, had his attempt to continue south after occupying El Eisa thwarted, and British forces are now sending patrols westward along the entire line, encountering only Axis flat-trajectory artillery fire along the way. In general, General Rommel is replenishing his armored units and has apparently received strong reinforcements. The general impression in Cairo is that the Axis forces will launch an offensive. General Auchinleck, commander of the British forces in the Middle East, is sending small [strength] units to attack enemy lines in order to prevent the enemy from obtaining reinforcements. British artillery and air forces are also very active. The British counter-offensive launched on the central section of the front a few days ago caught the German authorities off guard, and the German tanks arrived too late [to] unleash their power. This move is related [to what], because the German army could not help but modify its original plan and abandon its lateral movements. Although there have been large sandstorms on the front in recent days, which are not suitable for attacks, British aircraft still bombed Axis bases as usual, especially Tobruk, and Mersa Matruh was also attacked by British aircraft for 30 minutes. Since the British army withdrew from the port, this is the first time it has attacked illiterate people there. In short, all these battles cannot be regarded as a real decisive battle, because it will only be clear in the next few days whether General Rommel has obtained sufficient reinforcements to launch a general offensive against Egypt.

### Alexandria: Fate of French Warships; British Troops Will Sink Them if Necessary

According to reliable information from the U.S., the French fleet anchored in Alexandria, to prevent it from falling into German hands, will be sunk by British forces when the German-Rommel army approaches Alexandria. Because the French government does not want to move its fleet as the British wish, there is no other way but to sink them.

### Soviet Murmansk (II): A Seaport within the Arctic Circle: The History of Murmansk

The initial Russian presence in Murmansk dates back to the thirteenth century. These newcomers, the agile people of Novgorod, bartered fishing hooks and iron tools made in Western Europe with the inhabitants of Lapland and the local fishermen for furs. The relatively temperate climate of the Kola Bay appears to have appealed to these Russians, who established a permanent trading market on this perpetually ice-free coast, naming it "Kola." Subsequently, foreign merchants gradually flowed in from the distant west and southwest. The scope of trade expanded, and the city of Kola slowly grew.

However, in the fifteenth century, the Muscovite Tsars began to interfere with the freedom and commerce of the Novgorodians, indirectly determining the fate of Kola. By the early sixteenth century, due to the continuous arrival of English and Dutch ships and merchants, a new seaport emerged at the mouth of the North Dvina River to the east, namely the port of Arkhangelsk. Despite being frozen for six months of the year, it became an extremely prosperous seaport. By the late nineteenth century, the Russians once again remembered the ice-free waters of Kola Bay. The purpose was not to revitalize trade but based on strategic needs, the Tsar conceived a plan to build a new city near the dwelling place of the Novgorodians. He intended to establish a strong naval base there, to be used as a supplementary port in case the Baltic Sea was blockaded.

In 1899, the port of Alexandrovsk was established near Kola Bay. However, the erroneous choice of location led to the complete failure of this plan. Perilous rock walls made navigation difficult, and there was only one available harbor opening. Yet, despite this, its location remained unchanged until the outbreak of World War I. In 1915, due to the constant exposure of the Russian fleet in the Baltic Sea to danger, the Russian authorities decided in September of the same year to build Romanov six miles from the old city of Kola towards the mouth of the bay. A year and a half later, the Romanov dynasty was overthrown, and this new city was renamed Murmansk.

By this time, the railway connecting Leningrad (then known as Petrograd) and this ice-free seaport had been completed. Allied ships sailed into the port, transferring vast quantities of war supplies destined for the Russian front to freight trains traveling to various key points. Since its development, the seaport had been rife with rumors of espionage and strikes. From 1916 to 1917, to safeguard the port, the Russian authorities dispatched a fleet from Vladivostok to Murmansk, sailing around the globe. This fleet consisted of two destroyers and several mineboats, with a total crew of eighteen hundred men. Apart from this, the port's population was limited to a few thousand dockworkers and train porters. It can therefore be said that this was entirely a men's seaport.

In 1918, the European part of Russia was entirely purchased by Lenin, and Anglo-French Allied forces landed in Murmansk to protect the war supplies stored there. Shortly thereafter, when the port's laborers took rebellious action against the Allied forces, British and Imperial Russian forces jointly established prisoner-of-war camps on nearby islands.

American troops, under orders from President Wilson, were also sent there to assist in security duties. In the summer of 1918, the American ship Olympia sailed into Murmansk harbor. At this time, disputes broke out among the crew members of a Russian destroyer stationed there, culminating in armed clashes. Seeing the large numbers involved on both sides and the seriousness of the situation, the Russian officers, aware of their inability to quell the unrest, had no choice but to seek help from the Allied and American warships. The British commander initially agreed to help but soon went back on his word. Thus, only the American warship intervened to resolve the conflict.

As time passed, the Allied forces and American fleet members gradually became weary. With the end of the Great War, they returned home one after another. After that, the Imperial Russian forces were utterly defeated, and by 1919, the red flag of Moscow was flying over Murmansk and all parts of the north.

In 1920, the population of Murmansk was only two thousand five hundred, but by 1926 it had increased to six thousand seven hundred. The Soviet government cherished grand plans for this place. In both the first and second Five-Year Plans, it invested vast amounts of labor and money in Murmansk, rapidly industrializing and strengthening the local military. By 1935, the population had surged to one hundred and three thousand. The Soviet authorities were truly concerned with the revitalization of Murmansk. After Kirov's assassination in 1934, the Leningrad-Murmansk Railway, formerly known as the Murmansk Railway, was renamed the Kirov Railway.

### Rental Rates Not Consistent Among Real Estate Agencies; Collection Should Wait Until Regulations are Announced

Regarding the rental situation in Shanghai, according to recent investigations, most landlords have requested tenants to pay rent in Central Reserve Certificates at a one-to-one ratio with the old legal tender amount.

A Few Landlords Have Increased Rents

Furthermore, some landlords have even decided to increase Central Reserve Certificate rents by 10% to 15%. These landlords are mostly those who prioritize profit. They own a small number of houses and rent them to poorer citizens, exploiting them greatly. As for reputable large companies, they have not only not raised rents but also collected rent in Central Reserve Certificates at various discounts based on the old legal tender.

Inconsistent Rental Amounts Among Real Estate Companies

Real estate companies that have not reduced rents but demand rent to be collected at a one-to-one ratio include New China Bank, Yipin Loan Bank, Wing On Real Estate Company, and Qinyi Real Estate Company. Those that have increased rents include Asian Real Estate Company, Universal Investment Company, Shanghai Real Estate Company, and Huashi Trading Company (translation).

Should Wait for Authorities to Decide

Those that are delaying rent collection to await the Xingya Institute's decision include China Business Company, Yeguang Company, New China Bank, and Hardoon Company. In cases of rental disputes where tenants have taken legal action, the courts have decided to reduce rent payments. The amount is determined by the tenant's ability, and some only pay half or three-quarters. All payments are made to the court for transfer to the landlord, and the landlord may not send personnel to collect rent from tenants at the end of the month, pending clarification of the rental situation and the establishment of new regulations.

### Third Phase of Grain Distribution; Quantity of Purchase Slips; More Broken Rice; Rice Quantity Reduced Appropriately; Flour Quantity Will Not Change

Since the two concessions actively prepared for grain distribution based on population at the end of last month, more than half a month has passed. Most citizens have received the second phase of grain rations and are satisfied with the fact that they do not need to squeeze or pay excessively high prices to obtain these food rations. Moreover, the quality of both white rice and flour is pure. However, there are many who believe that the broken rice contains iron sand, which is harmful to the stomach and intestines. Therefore, in addition to everyone carefully selecting and washing the rice, they all hope that ways will be found to compensate for this deficiency.

Contracted Rice Stores' Purchase Slip Allotment

The second phase of the grain distribution implemented by the authorities of the two concessions has lasted for three days and is scheduled to end on the 18th. Those who have not yet purchased rice from rice stores using the second coupon of the rice purchase certificate should do so quickly, otherwise the coupon will be invalidated after the deadline. The third phase will be sold from the 20th to the 25th, using the third coupon to purchase. Although the authorities have not announced the distribution method for the next phase of rice, it is learned that the quantity of purchase slips obtained by various contracted rice stores from the grain distribution office yesterday shows that the allocation of broken rice has increased compared to before, while the allocation of white rice has decreased appropriately. The flour allocation remains the same.

Grain Distribution Begins for Indian Residents

### Coal Briquette Quality Deteriorates; Firewood Makes a Comeback

Shanghai's fuel supply has traditionally relied on external sources. Due to the shortage of coal and the deterioration in the quality of coal briquettes, general users have felt inconvenienced, leading many to switch to firewood for cooking. This firewood is purchased from mountainous areas such as Hangzhou and Huzhou, transported to Shanghai by private boats, and unloaded and stored at North Xinjing and Suzhou Creek. When transported, it is mostly in the form of thin branches, which are quite coarse and clumsy. It is then sawn, broken, split, and shaved into small bundles before being sold. Previously, the selling price was very low, barely exceeding ten yuan per load. Now, prices have gradually risen, with each load costing at least 20 to 30 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes.

Factory Cloth: Yesterday's market saw weak sales as cloth sellers returned to the lower reaches, resulting in a soft market. There was a desire to increase prices but no strength to do so. Light-weight coarse cloth was relatively stable, such as 9-pound Xinzhi at 115 yuan, and 8-pound Zhenzhong at 113 yuan. Heavy-weight cloth was sluggish and declining, with 16-pound Earth at 183 yuan and Flying Swan at 181 yuan, with few sales. Fine cloth also saw a decline of 2-3 yuan. 12-pound Earth was later reduced to 165 yuan, Dapeng new order at 160 yuan, and Fugui at 161 yuan. Bleached cloth and crepe had no major gains or losses, with Magnolia at 168 yuan and Longevity at 6.25 yuan. Serge also fell by 0.05 to 0.10 yuan, with Three Sheep brand trading at 6.10 yuan. As for peach blossom lady's cloth, it was especially weak due to being affected by many floating sales. Opening in the morning at 273.50 yuan, it closed in the evening at 269 yuan, a significant decline of 3.50 yuan per bolt.

East Cloth: It initially fell, then rebounded, but ultimately declined. New orders for 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth opened in the morning at 186 yuan, rose to 188 yuan, then fell back to 186.50 yuan at closing, a reduction of 2 yuan compared to the previous day. Bank orders at 165.50 yuan were down 1 yuan. The opening price for Four Gentlemen serge was very small, only 7.20 yuan, and it quickly rose to 7.2125 yuan, then gradually declined. At noon, it closed at 7.205 yuan, a decline of about 0.10 yuan per yard.

### Rainproof Serge: Supply Does Not Meet Demand

Because imported raincoat material has sold out, rainproof cloth has become the best-selling item. However, due to its weak resistance to rain, there is a shortage of rainproof serge, as it is stronger than rainproof cloth. Rainproof serge and rainproof cloth appear generally the same at a glance, but rainproof cloth is smooth and beautiful, mostly coated with wax and soap paste on the surface. Rainproof serge has a tighter fabric with more fluff. The vertical and horizontal lines of the fabric fully absorb metal salts, resulting in varying degrees of rain resistance. Buyers, especially customers, require these qualities. Therefore, they have continued to switch to rainproof serge for raincoats, as they only want them to be waterproof and practical, unlike clothing for sunny days, which emphasizes color and design. Yesterday, Da Ming brand rainproof serge sold for 21 yuan per yard. Before price controls were implemented, it sold for 26 yuan.

### All Miscellaneous Grains are Rising

Soybeans continued to be in short supply and sold yesterday, with transactions remaining sporadic and lacking wholesale activity. The market trend remains bullish. Sales included 20 bags of Chongming sand silkworms at a price of 111 yuan, 10 bags of new Qing silkworms at a price of 155 yuan, and over 10 bags of Tianjin tea beans at a price of 210 yuan. All were self-sold.

Sorghum arrivals were not smooth, and the market inventory felt short. Yesterday, 30 bags of Kaifeng Mingguang sorghum were sold at a price of 106 yuan.

The removal of dried sweet potatoes from this street remains active, and prices are once again trending up by 1-2 yuan. Yesterday, 100 bags of Jiangbei dried sweet potatoes opened at a price of 108 yuan.

Soybean cake opened in the morning yesterday, with prices rising sharply by 3-5 yuan due to competition from Jiading and Luodian gangs. Later, due to reduced sales, prices weakened by 1-2 yuan. Sales included 500 pieces of Hankou old cake at a price of 51 yuan, 1,500 pieces of May new product from Li Zi brand at a price of 67-68 yuan, and 2,000 pieces of May new product from Shengji brand with Yoshida warehouse orders at a price of 68.5-69.5 yuan, and Wangu warehouse orders at 63.5-64 yuan. Another 500 pieces of May new product were priced at 66 yuan, and 500 pieces of June product were priced at 66 yuan.

The bran market is continuing to rise. Yesterday, the Xiangzhuang gang handled 200 small packages of bran from Sanxin, with a warehouse order for May at a price of 98 yuan.

### Sugar Stocks Stabilize

Yesterday's sugar stock orders at the Sugar Merchant Cooperative Business Office showed a slightly stabilizing trend. The market rose slightly by 0.05 yuan at the beginning, but then fell back, with not much change in the end. The opening price for coarse white stock was 314 yuan, and the closing price was slightly softer at 313.5 yuan. However, there were not many transactions, with a total of only 600 yuan. There were still no transactions for red sugar stock.

### Forsythia No Longer Holding Firm

Forsythia has also become less actively traded recently, and the authorities are suppressing market prices. Some of the hoarding is gradually being released, and the buyers are no longer holding firm. Therefore, the opening price has softened, with a decline of 100 yuan before and after. It opened at 550 yuan, with sales commissions added as usual. The market picture is flat.

### Guzhen New Daylily Samples Seen

Jin Zhen Cai Daylily from Guzhen in northern Jiangsu is also produced there, and this year's product has already been seen. Small samples were sent to the Shen Bao yesterday, and the color is still good, but the strips are shorter. The price is also reasonable. However, it is not yet clear whether the returned goods will be suitable, so a subsequent letter must be waited for before shipping to Shanghai is possible.

### Matches Absorb Locally, Price Jumps 200-300 Yuan

The market for daily necessities has been relatively quiet recently. Yesterday, the trading price of items like large matches suddenly became brisk. Due to widespread rumors of advantageous sales, some people are eagerly absorbing them at low prices, so prices jumped by about 200-300 yuan. Soap remained stable. There was generally little aggressiveness, with Guben soap still at 335 yuan, Huangxiang Mao soap at 210 yuan, Baixiang Mao soap at 250 yuan, Arrow Knife soap at 270 yuan, Phoenix brand at 3,200 yuan, Beauty brand at 3,300 yuan, Rose brand at 2,500 yuan, and miscellaneous brands at 2,300 yuan. Foreign candles rose slightly, with Bailey's priced at 125 yuan, Monk's Cap brand at 120 yuan, and miscellaneous brands at 95 yuan. Prices rose by ten thousand yuan.

### Cigarettes Lack Strength to Rise

Cigarette selling prices still lack vitality. Actual sales remain sluggish, and morale is increasingly depressed. Therefore, there is a lack of strength to raise prices. Opening prices were 8,650 yuan for Great British Brand, 5,450 yuan for Old Knife Brand, 4,600 yuan for Pinhai Brand, 3,650 yuan for Fairy Brand, and 3,550 yuan for Wuhua Brand. Japanese cigarettes followed the downward trend, with Golden Spear Brand continuing to fall slightly to 1,300 yuan, a decrease of 50 yuan from the previous day. Golden Building Brand was 1,950 yuan, Red Rose Brand was 950 yuan, Quanlu Brand was 1,900 yuan, and Guide Brand was 1,200 yuan. National cigarettes Golden Mouse Brand was 1,500 yuan, Beauty Brand was 2,900 yuan, and Pyramid was 2,900 yuan, all showing a soft trend.

### Overcoming Hardship

— Gao Jiaji

Hardship is not a fixed thing. The magnitude of hardship is determined by your attitude. When I was young, once I lost 25 cents, and I was unhappy for several days. When the world was in a depression, I lost hundreds and thousands of times that amount of money, but I don't remember being very unhappy. The money was already lost, and there was no way to recover it. Common sense told me to accept my loss and find a way to earn more money. Perhaps due to the lessons learned from this experience, my method of handling money has become smarter than before, so in any case, my money was not lost in vain.

What defeats a person's virtue is not the hardship we encounter, but our attitude towards accepting hardship. Those who become angry or sad, indignant or discouraged because of encountering hardship have become victims of hardship. Those who accept the hardship they have already encountered and try to change the current situation can often make improvements.

The biggest mistake people make is treating hardship as a personal matter, as if hardship were a retaliatory act that God is inflicting on them personally. We must understand that hardship is simply a part of life. When Columbus sailed across the Atlantic Ocean in a ship the size of a fishing boat four hundred and fifty years ago, he encountered storms and waves along the way and faced opposition from the sailors on board. Did he not suffer great hardship? However, because of his fearlessness of hardship and difficulty, he finally discovered the New World and became an immortal figure in history.

Hardship is a part of life. Anyone who can objectively accept this fact, without injecting any personal resentment, can become the victor over hardship. Don't focus all your energy on the hardship itself, but use most of your energy to deal with your hardship with a constructive attitude. (Abridged translation of the original work by Xue Boli)

### A Swede Who Doesn't Pick Up Lost Items

— 疋

Regarding the honesty and trustworthiness of the Swedish people, there have been many accounts throughout history. It is said that once, a Russian tourist left a gold coin in a certain place in a certain city in Sweden, forgetting to take it with him. Twenty years later, this tourist happened to return to this city for business and suddenly remembered the gold coin. He went to check on it, and to his surprise, the gold coin was still in its original place, waiting for its owner to claim it.

On another occasion, King Gustav Adolf of Sweden, in order to test how honest the people in his country really were, deliberately dropped twelve gold coins in the places he passed. Most of them landed in the homes of poor people. Within a few days, all of these gold coins were picked up and returned to him, because they all knew that only the king would drop such things.

Yet another time, he scattered a thousand silver rings, all of the same heavy weight and identical design, throughout the country, placing them by roadsides, in forests, churches, small inns, and markets, and so on. In less than three months, nine hundred and seventy-nine of them were discovered and sent to the various lost and found offices. The king was very pleased with this result.

Currently in Sweden, even a small place has a "Lost and Found Office." Its origins can be traced back to the early Middle Ages, when other countries in Europe were suffering from rampant theft.

These lost and found offices are often located in an empty house in the city center, with a few tables and chairs inside. Anyone who finds something simply has to bring the item to the office and leave a note stating the date and location where it was found.

In smaller towns, there are no staff members in the office. These lost items are picked up and brought in by honest people, and then taken away by the honest owners themselves, without the need for supervision or inspection. This kind of system would probably not work anywhere else in the world, but in Sweden, it has been tested for hundreds of years and has consistently yielded good results.

Official announcements only need a few simple words to make people abide by them, and what the general public says is almost equivalent to an oath. Police officers, judges, and income tax investigators, etc., all base their duties on the straightforward words of the common people.

In the past, a small child stole half a pint of milk from a neighbor and was dragged through the entire village by his school teacher, displayed like some strange animal for people to see. They stopped at each school to make an exhibition. This happened in the mid-19th century. To this day, it is still often recounted by teachers in Swedish schools, and since then, the same incident has never happened again.

In addition, there is another matter that can demonstrate the honesty and trustworthiness of the Swedish people, and that is the scarcity of commercial fraud cases, which are probably less than a quarter of the European average.

### Impressions of University Life

— Hong Dao

(1) First Entering University

University is the highest institution for studying specialized knowledge, the place where national talents are made, and the gathering place of intellectuals. Which parents don't want to send their children to university for further study? Which young person doesn't want to enter university to pursue advanced knowledge and lay the foundation for their career? No wonder a large number of high school graduates flock to knock on the door of university every year.

University and high school differ in many ways in terms of curriculum, teaching methods, and moral education due to the different goals of education. The purpose of high school education is to instill basic knowledge, so that students are prepared for both further education and employment. Teachers stand in a supervisory position, strictly guiding students so that they dare not ignore their studies and dare not fail to work hard. Students are considered to have fulfilled their responsibilities as long as they complete the assigned homework. The purpose of university education is to train specialists, so students can freely choose the subjects they like. Students take a more active role in learning, and teachers are only there to guide them. University authorities treat university students as adults, so they are given considerable freedom in thought and action. However, there are not many young people who can truly exercise self-control to use this freedom. Whether young people can obtain the greatest benefits from university education depends on whether they know how to adapt to this free environment.

Most high school graduates who are new to university do not know how to breathe in the free academic air of university. They often have to wait until they have suffered and learned their lesson before they understand that the freedom of university students should not be abused. In high school, teachers constantly quiz students in class, and students have no choice but to step up their preparation. Once they enter university, professors lecture at length in class but do not spend time quizzing students. They do not ask whether students have prepared the assigned homework or read the assigned reference books. Usually, there is only one exam every two or three weeks. Therefore, young people who are new to university feel that university professors are very polite, not like high school teachers who force you to study. They feel that being a university student is really carefree, just listening to lectures and taking notes, without having to prepare homework. After class, they go out to watch movies and play, wasting valuable time and throwing their homework to the back of their minds. When the monthly exam is approaching, they see a huge pile of things they haven't prepared and start to panic, engaging in "last-minute cramming." Some of the smarter ones may be lucky enough to pass, but most students have to taste the bitter fruit of failure. Failing the exam and not getting credits is a small matter. What is most unfortunate is failing to gain the benefits you should from the subjects you are studying. This is the result of university students abusing their freedom. Only those who know how to adapt to the academic environment of university can obtain true knowledge from university courses.

### The Serious Leprosy Problem in Shanghai

— Wang Zhixin

Leprosy in China is most prevalent in Guangdong, Fujian, Yangzhou, and Jinan. We Shanghai people do not seem to be very familiar with it. However, Shanghai is a commercial port where people from all over gather, with a population of about four million. Recently, since the outbreak of the war, the number of people coming from other provinces to take refuge has been even greater. The invasion of leprosy is even more rampant than in the past. Although there are no accurate surveys or statistics at present, from the records of leprosy treatment centers and dermatological clinics, and from the clinical experience of famous doctors such as Diao Xinde and Lai Douyan, it is known that in Shanghai, the number of people suffering from this disease is not small. Taking the Shanghai Leprosy Sanatorium established by the Chinese Leprosy Relief Association as an example, it currently accommodates 115 leprosy patients, and on average, 40 to 50 people consult at the Shanghai clinic every Tuesday and Saturday. Among these people seeking treatment, some come for one or two visits and do not continue immediately, which is even more variable. In addition, this type of disease is often not easily detected in the early stages, or it may be accumulated for a very long period of time before it is discovered. Among them, there are those who knowingly conceal the disease and avoid medical treatment. From this, it can be inferred that there are at least one or two thousand lepers in Shanghai. Fellow citizens of Shanghai! Try to close your eyes and imagine the consequences. If these one or two thousand patients are allowed to spread among the general society, what will be the degree of danger!

In page 1370 of the Royal Society of Medicine Journal, Dr. Whiteley of the medical authorities of Nauru Island is recorded as saying that the island had only four leprosy patients in 1920, but by 1928, it had increased to 218. Most of these patients were transmitted indirectly from these few four people, proving that this increase in number is not an arithmetic progression, but a geometric progression. According to the calculation of this geometric progression, this population of four hundred thousand in Shanghai could be completely spread within twelve years. Is this terrible or not?

It should be known that its contagiousness is not as severe as tuberculosis and syphilis, and most of the people suffering from this disease are from the poor class, such as rickshaw pullers, laundry workers, servants, and small vendors selling food. Due to the filth of their dwellings and the lowliness of their lives, the possibility of infection is naturally greater. However, people in the upper class are also inevitably infected unintentionally. This is often found in clinics and shelters. Therefore, the above calculation should not be regarded as alarmist. A single spark can start a prairie fire. If we do not rise up and extinguish this scourge, the consequences are unimaginable. Saving people is saving oneself. Fellow citizens of Shanghai, why not rise up!

### Sharing the Same Boat in Storms

— He Jia Zhi

(7) Swift Thunder

Wei Cheng listened and said with a smile: "Does Wei Yunqing have any grandsons? Mrs. Ye Er said: "I heard that he had grandsons, but they are dead now. There is also a funny story about Wei Shaoyun marrying a wife: after he married her, Wei Yunqing grumbled in front of his son, saying that you marrying a wife cost me a lot of money. Wei Shaoyun was so angry that he sent his wife to Wei Yunqing's room, saying that since you are reluctant to spend money, then this wife is considered to be the one you married. This is naturally a joke. Then, Wei Yunqing continued to grumble and scold his in-laws for being money-grubbing. Wei Shaoyun heard it and did not sleep with his wife for three consecutive nights. On the fourth day, he returned her to his father-in-law, saying I have returned your daughter, now you return my father's money. His father-in-law threatened to sue Wei Yunqing and his son, and then things calmed down." Wei Cheng laughed and said, "Wei Yunqing and his son are not human beings. One is stingy to the extreme, and the other is狂悖to the extreme. This is called like father, like son. Aunt, I don't want to have any more financial relations with the Wei family. I will pay them back whatever money I owe them, as quickly as possible. If I can't pay, then I will sell a few more acres of land to them. His high-interest exploitation is even more ruthless than other people's knives." Mrs. Ye Er said: "Don't worry about this, I'm here. I think your sister-in-law has passed away, so I'll take on this burden. I can't do anything else, but if I sell land once or twice, it won't sound good. I'm just thinking that at the moment, it's just a matter of shifting from here to there, just to get by. When you marry a wife, then everything will be smooth sailing." Wei Cheng listened and could not refute his aunt's words. Mrs. Ye Er smiled again and said: "If you feel bored, you can also go to Suzhou to see your teacher and classmates, or go to Shanghai to see Mr. Chen and Miss Chen. Staying at home alone will really make you sick. Anyway, the atmosphere is open now, so if you want 珍小姐to accompany you, it's nothing bad.叶二本太These words contained some mystery, while saying them, she looked at Wei Cheng's face. When she mentioned Cui Zhen, she also carefully looked at the crack in the door. (129)
