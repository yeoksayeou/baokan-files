### Libyan War to Reach Decisive Stage: German Main Force Attacks Tobruk, Tank Battle Unfolds East of El Gazala

Lisbon, 2nd (Allied News Agency) - According to news received here, German and Italian forces launched an offensive in Libyan North Africa on the morning of May 27th. The battle is fierce, marking the largest mechanized unit combat since the beginning of the Libyan War. General Rommel's forces launched an offensive at the intersection of El Gazala, Tobruk, and Bir Hakeim. The Axis tank force commander is Nehring, while the British commander is Ritchie. Both commanders issued orders to their respective forces. Rommel's order stated that his troops should engage the British in a decisive battle, while Ritchie ordered his forces not to give the enemy any rest. This illustrates the intensity of the current fighting. According to a British communiqué, the Libyan climate is gradually becoming hotter, making it difficult for soldiers to continue fighting in tanks for two days under such conditions. German officers believe that under these harsh conditions, it is impossible to sustain tank warfare for more than five days. However, it is generally believed that the situation in North Africa will be finally decided within the next eighteen hours. The German forces are currently advancing rapidly. It is questionable whether this German offensive is a large-scale one. In any case, this battle is a struggle for Tobruk, a key base for future offensive operations. Libyan Border, 1st (Havas) - The North African war has lasted for seven days and is intensifying, and will reach a decisive stage within days. The German offensive aims to directly approach El Adem and Tobruk. On the other hand, they are advancing from the east of El Gazala towards Gapsos. Although the British have laid mines everywhere on their defensive lines, two gaps have been controlled by the German and Italian forces. The Allied forces are currently advancing eastward and have met with fierce resistance from General Ritchie's troops. In short, the main force dispatched by General Rommel is now attacking Tobruk. However, the British forces are maneuvering freely, and a major battle has broken out east of El Gazala. Although the British tank forces suffered heavy losses, they still prevented the German forces from advancing rapidly until reinforcements arrived, maintaining their original positions. The German forces are also aware of their difficult situation, as they are located between the British defensive line and Ritchie's troops, and the gaps are narrow, making it impossible to transport large quantities of supplies. Therefore, the German forces are currently making every effort to maintain their supply lines and expand their occupied areas. British aircraft, regardless of losses, are attacking the German forces to prevent them from advancing rapidly. However, General Rommel still has a large number of troops at his disposal, and his lifeline passes through one of these two gaps, enabling him to defend the fairly solid positions with all his strength. The future course of the war depends on the remaining offensive capabilities of both sides after a week of fierce fighting. This is because both armies are fighting in the desert, and the hot weather will inevitably exhaust them after this arduous battle. In addition, the German air force is very active over Libya. British advance units are constantly shelling the German and Italian vanguard in the Tobruk area, with the sound of artillery fire constantly echoing. Berlin, 2nd (Havas) - The military headquarters has just issued a brief communiqué stating that in the past three days, our forces in North Africa have destroyed 451 enemy tanks and many motorcycles south of Tobruk. As a result of the German-Italian forces attacking a certain enemy defensive position, in addition to annihilating a large enemy force, they also captured 3,000 enemy officers and soldiers. An enemy brigade commander was shot down by our anti-aircraft artillery while inspecting the front lines by plane and was also captured.

### Churchill Reports on the War Situation

London, 2nd (Havas) - Prime Minister Churchill delivered a speech in the House of Commons today, reporting on the war situation in Libyan North Africa. He said, "The Libyan war is not over, and the outcome still requires effort. However, the morale of our troops is extremely high, and we have many reasons to be satisfied with the progress of the war. We should pay the utmost attention to the development of the war. I have asked General Auchinleck to report on the situation there, and I will now report to you the main points based on his telegram. On the evening of May 26th, General Auchinleck telegraphed that General Rommel's attack on the British positions was within our expectations, so we were prepared. According to the information we have obtained, the enemy's goal is to destroy our military strength in order to directly attack Tobruk. Their operational plan includes first attacking El Gazala, so the German 15th and 21st Panzer Divisions moved south of the city. At the same time, the German 90th Light Division, the Italian 20th Mobile Division, the 132nd Division, and the 101st Motorized Division also acted in succession. Until May 21st, the British Air Force bombed enemy concentration points non-stop throughout the night. Since May 24th, the enemy has also adopted our strategy, but failed and lost many aircraft. On the night of May 26th, the Italian African indigenous troops also advanced rapidly towards Acroma according to plan, but were all repelled by our forces. Although a small number of tanks once arrived, enough to control the high ground north of Acroma, they failed to break through the communication line between Tobruk and the South African forces. That night, the enemy attempted to land along the coast, but was also repelled by our forces. The enemy's third step was to attack our positions in the El Gazala area, which was launched in the afternoon of May 27th but failed. After three days of fierce fighting, the outcome is still undecided. As far as the current situation is concerned, the enemy feels a severe shortage of supplies and has had to open two gaps in our minefields. General Cunningham decided on the 28th to concentrate the air force to bomb the enemy's transport convoys. Over the course of three days, the amount of military equipment destroyed is incalculable. The El Gazala area is still under British control, and the war is still in progress. As for the recent continuous bombing of Germany by British aircraft, the British public should not expect the national air force to bomb German industrial areas with a large number of aircraft every day. But I dare to assure the people that German ports and industrial centers will face unprecedented difficulties that no country has ever experienced."

### Japanese Armies on the Offensive in All Directions, Vanguard Reaches Northeast of Quzhou, Battles Break Out Simultaneously in Guangdong and Jiangxi Provinces

Shanghai (Allied News Agency) - According to front-line Japanese sources, the Japanese army has launched a general offensive against areas in front of Xianzhou. Japanese units are encircling from the east, south, and north, fiercely attacking the south bank of the Qu River.

### US War Expenditure for Last Month Astonishing - Exceeds $3.55 Billion

### President Roosevelt Requests Declaration of War Against Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania - Generally Believed that the US Authorities Are Making a Political Gesture Towards the Soviet Union

Washington, 2nd (Havas) - President Roosevelt sent a message to Congress today, requesting a declaration of war against Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania. His message stated in part: "I am well aware that the governments of these three countries are not free to act and cannot represent the wishes of their people, but are merely tools in Hitler's hands. However, the governments of the three countries are now engaged in actions that directly attack the Allied nations. I therefore request that Congress declare that a state of war now exists between the United States and Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania." However, political figures believe that this declaration of war is merely a formality. Buenos Aires, 3rd (Allied News Agency) - According to Washington news, President Roosevelt submitted a message to Congress yesterday, advocating a declaration of war against Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania. House Majority Leader McCormack subsequently stated that the President's message has been sent to the House Foreign Affairs Committee, which will be able to submit a war proposal to the House for a vote today. Washington, 2nd (Havas) - President Roosevelt's request to Congress to declare war on Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria has been commented on by political figures, who believe that this move is a political gesture towards the Soviet Union. It seems that the United States intends to use this to put pressure on those countries, reducing their degree of military assistance to Germany against the Soviet Union, or at least preventing it from increasing further. At the same time, it hints to the Soviet authorities that the scope of American cooperation in the Soviet war effort is no longer limited to supplying military equipment, but is prepared to provide political assistance, regardless of the consequences. This decision of the United States is completely legal, as the governments of the three countries declared war on the United States months ago, but the United States did not respond. Secretary of State Hull, when referring to the governments of Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria, used the term "puppet organizations." In addition, it is worth noting that although Finland also participated in the war against the Soviet Union, the President did not request a declaration of war against it. The reason for this is probably that the United States is not yet completely hopeless of persuading Finland to withdraw from the war, and the fact that Americans have always sympathized with Finland and are unwilling to be overly coercive is also a well-known fact. From a military point of view, the US declaration of war against the three countries has no major significance, but it has significant political implications. In the future, the overseas residents of Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary will be treated in the same way as the overseas residents of Germany, Italy, and Japan. The police authorities will be able to closely monitor their actions. According to regulations, overseas residents of enemy countries are not allowed to possess wireless radios, cameras, or military weapons, and are not allowed to leave the cities where they reside without the permission of the authorities.

### II. An Overview of Turkey (5)

After Kemal became President, he paused for a few months before deciding to abolish the cumbersome Islamic papacy. This was not because he feared that this disgraced figure, once an emperor and now a mere pope, would take any retaliatory action in the future; rather, it was because Kemal, a man of new knowledge, had long understood that the practice of establishing religion through divine authority was a kind of retrogression. In this era of rapid new thought, some things were simply unnecessary. But this work was far from easy. Everyone knew that Islamic tradition was deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. Once the papacy, the sacred office of public faith, was abolished, it would be fine if the goal was achieved; but if the people did not follow, wouldn't all efforts be in vain? However, Kemal had a pair of iron hands and a lively mind. He first made all members of parliament and intellectuals understand that love for the country was superior to love for religion. Then, in a parliament session, he gave a passionate speech outlining the reasons, and ultimately the sacred papal office was abolished.

With the above two major tasks successfully completed, Kemal then came up with a set of minor tricks, like a brief interlude in a farce. He proposed abolishing the red fez hat worn by everyone. This fez hat was similar to our old felt hats, but with a round, flat top. What was the point of this? It was actually the same intention as his abolition of the veils worn by women. Women wearing veils represented the foolishness of customs and closed-minded thinking; and the red fez hat also represented backwardness and stubbornness! Moreover, the reason for creating this felt hat was to facilitate bowing during prayer rituals. Even the Pope had been abolished, so why cherish this bowing hat?

Another groundbreaking reform was the creation of a Romanized Turkish script. The language previously used in Turkey was Arabic script. However, this script was extremely imperfect, lacking vowels and having incomplete consonants! To write a word, one sometimes had to go in circles; it was cumbersome and lengthy, "Grigda." It was a sin to force people to learn such a language; and how could such a language be qualified as a bridge of knowledge, and how could it serve as a cultural tool! Kemal, this outstanding figure of his generation, resolutely abolished it and adopted Romanized script across the board.

The above are just a few examples of the many construction efforts undertaken in the Turkish reconstruction movement. There were many other great innovative programs, too numerous to list here.

Current Situation

Kemal served as president of Turkey for fifteen years, transforming a corrupt empire into a brand-new model country in the world. This is historical fact. If it could have continued to progress so rapidly for another ten years, I am convinced that Turkey would certainly be one of the first-class powers. Unfortunately, this man who held up the sky with his bare hands passed away in the autumn of 1938. In that year, the world situation gradually became turbulent again. What about Turkey?

Regarding Turkey itself, I must also briefly analyze it. In terms of resources, it is quite enviable: the weather is good and the land is extremely fertile. In terms of production, since the improvement of agriculture, it can be said that there are bountiful harvests of grain and abundant fruits; tobacco, grapes, figs, cotton, sugar beets, etc. are flourishing. In addition, there are millions to tens of millions of cattle, horses, and sheep. Both the quantity and quality of mineral resources are above average; well-known minerals include zinc, magnesium, antimony, copper, silver, arsenic, coal, etc. Export goods include opium, zinc, grains, tobacco, cotton, glue, wool, morocco leather, carpets, etc. Both agriculture and industry have adopted modern machinery and systems.

Regarding military affairs, there are about 1.3 million able-bodied men who can be mobilized, and there are more than ten mechanized infantry divisions. According to a 1937 report, the first-line air force has about six to seven hundred aircraft, and in the last five years, it is expected to have increased at least two or three times; one can understand this by looking at the achievements of glider training schools.

As for political leaders, the current president, Ismet, is also an outstanding figure of his generation. When Kemal was alive, he relied on him as his right-hand man. In the difficult era of Turkey, his strong diplomacy on several occasions was his masterpiece. He is also an excellent military strategist. His name, Inonu, commemorates the city where he defeated the Greek army. The Turkish people respect him as much as they respected Kemal. (End)

### Situation Chaotic on the Eastern Front: Heavy Fighting Resumes at Kalinin, Kharkov Front Becomes Quiet, Two Armies Face Each Other Across the Donets River

Bucharest, 2nd (Havas) - According to military sources here, heavy fighting has resumed in the Kalinin area, indicating that Moscow will be the target of the next German offensive. The German side only stated that there would be offensive battles near the city of Kalinin. The Soviet side said that although the fighting in that area was of a local nature, it was quite fierce, and they believe the German army has made slight progress. The Soviet army is now rearranging its defenses. In addition, there has also been heavy fighting along the Volkhov River in the north. However, the fighting on the Kharkov front has become quiet. Previously, General Timoshenko's troops once advanced to the line leading from Krasnograd to Lozovaya. However, because his right flank, that is, the line from Lozovaya to Slavyansk, was too weak, he was outflanked by General von Kleist, leading to failure. The German army also advanced north along the Donets River to link up with the German army in the north, so the Soviet army in that area has fallen into a pocket encirclement, with an area of about 1,000 square miles. Again, from Belgorod to Slavyansk, the German and Soviet armies are now facing each other across the Donets River. The main force of the Soviet army is on the east bank of the river, but there are still traces of the Soviet army in several places on the west bank, and the Soviet army still holds a few bridgeheads. According to the observation of military experts, General Timoshenko will inevitably attack Kharkov again in the near future. The German army also shows no sign of active activity. Although there is fighting in that area, the scope is not large, limited only to the northern and southern ends of Izyum. General Kleist is currently carrying out mopping-up operations. In addition, on the southern front, the line from Kharkov to Taganrog, there has been no significant activity in recent days. Further south, the port of Sevastopol is constantly being bombed by the German army, and major changes will occur soon. As for the future direction of the German attack, it will be none other than the two locations of Stalingrad and the Taman Peninsula. Both the German and Soviet sides are now transferring troops and engaging in preparations, and a major battle is expected to break out soon. Berlin, 2nd (Havas) - The Battle of Kharkov has now come to an end. The German Air Force concentrated its bombing on Sevastopol and the Red Army on the central and northern parts of the Eastern Front. The activities of the German aircraft are summarized as follows: On the southern front, German aircraft bombed transportation lines, destroying two important bridges. On the central front, German aircraft destroyed several enemy ammunition depots, annihilated several Soviet motorized units, and bombed a railway station, destroying many trains loaded with goods, and shot down four Soviet aircraft. On the northern front, German aircraft attacked the port of Murmansk, and bombs fell on the docks, exploding successively. The ships in the port suffered heavy losses. At that time, there was an air battle with Soviet aircraft, and a total of fourteen enemy aircraft were shot down, most of which were British Hurricane fighters.

Berlin, 2nd (Havas Agency) - The German High Command announced that British aircraft groups attempted to bomb the coasts of the Netherlands and Belgium yesterday but were intercepted by our patrol aircraft, suffering heavy losses. A total of two Spitfire aircraft were shot down over the English Channel by our aircraft.

Furthermore, the British government announced that its air force launched offensive bombing raids on German-occupied territories six times throughout this morning.

German Aircraft Conduct Retaliatory Air Raids on Britain

Berlin, 3rd (Haitong News Agency) - This morning, German fighter and bomber groups attacked cities in southeastern England and the Thames Estuary. Air raid sirens sounded in London, and residents heard the sounds of anti-aircraft guns.

Berlin, 2nd (Havas Agency) - It was officially announced that German aircraft groups bombed the important British supply ports of Ipswich and Canterbury yesterday. Eighteen British aircraft were shot down when bombing German-occupied areas in western France. One was shot down when bombing Cologne. Several cities in western Germany were attacked by enemy aircraft last night, especially the residential areas of Duisburg and Oberhausen. The enemy aircraft's objective in this attack was entirely to bomb civilians, resulting in 40 aircraft being shot down by our side. In the past 24 hours, the British side lost a total of 99 aircraft. Berlin, 3rd (Haitong News Agency) - The "People's Observer" published an article today entitled "The Cost of Terrorist Air Raids is Very High," arguing that the losses of British aircraft and crew during recent British air raids on western German cities were very high. When British aircraft conducted a terrorist air raid on Cologne from May 30th to 31st, the British side admitted to losing 44 aircraft. Adding the losses of British aircraft on other fronts, Britain lost 85 aircraft on May 30th alone. Although there were no large-scale night raids on May 31st, 43 British aircraft were still shot down. On June 1st and 2nd, when British aircraft raided Duisburg and Oberhausen, the German military report yesterday stated that 40 British aircraft were shot down. Adding the 19 British aircraft shot down yesterday, the total loss was 99 aircraft. This number does not include the losses of British aircraft in North Africa because information from North Africa has not yet been obtained. However, it can be determined that British aircraft lost at least 200 aircraft in these three days. The percentage of this loss is very high, and no country in the world can sustain such a large loss for a long time. Anglo-American propaganda exaggerates the British air raids on German cities as a "large-scale air offensive" in the hope of concealing their military incompetence from their people. Germany deeply mourns the loss of life, property, and culture caused by the air raids. However, the losses inflicted by Germany on the enemy are even greater. The number of crew members lost by British aircraft when raiding Germany is greater than the losses suffered by the German people. As for the losses of German military targets, even British experts admit that they are very minor. However, when the German air force raided Britain, the British side admitted to suffering serious losses. Therefore, our losses are much less than the losses suffered by the enemy. For example, after our aircraft raided Britain last night, all returned to base. This fact may seem strange at first glance, but upon closer examination, it is known that the training, aircraft, and tactics of the German air force are superior. In addition, the strength of German air defense is also a key to victory.

### French Citizens Hold Demonstrations to Protest British Bombing of Paris; Victims Publicly Buried Yesterday

Vichy, 2nd (Havas Agency) - The cabinet recently convened a state council meeting, during which Pétain and Laval expressed extreme indignation at the British aircraft bombing Paris again on May 30th. It is reported that various civil groups are planning to hold demonstrations tomorrow to protest. However, the form of the protest is not yet known. As for the British claim that the bombing of Paris was due to factories there working for Germany, political figures here consider it unfounded. If this explanation by the British side were acceptable, why wouldn't Britain bomb all neutral countries' factories that trade with Germany? Moreover, the British aircraft bombing is absolutely insufficient to strike at the production of factories in the Paris area. The result is only that innocent civilians are poisoned by it. Furthermore, more than 200 civilians were killed or injured in this British aircraft bombing, demonstrating the tragedy suffered by civilians. At today's state council meeting, the communist activities in the Paris area and the recent series of atrocities were also discussed, and an investigation report from the Paris court was heard. It was decided to hand over the captured criminals to a special court for trial to show the government's determination to strictly crack down on sabotage activities.

### Assassination in Paris: Clément Assassinated; Political Assassination Also Occurs in the Cote d'Or, the Assassinated Victim is an Influential Member of the Fascist Party

Paris, 2nd (Havas Agency) - A shocking political assassination occurred here. The deceased was Clément, editor of the People's Party (i.e., the party led by Doriot) newspaper "The National Voice." The murder occurred in the central Paris newspaper district at 7:40 PM. At that time, Clément and his wife had just left the newspaper office and arrived at the corner of Rue Vivienne and Rue Saint-Marc when a man about 30 years old suddenly fired three shots at them. The first bullet hit his wife, and the remaining two bullets killed Clément. The assassin immediately fled on a bicycle, but someone at the time recognized the bicycle's registration. In addition, several pedestrians gave detailed reports of the incident to the police station.

Douai, Northern France, 2nd (Havas Agency) - A homicide occurred here yesterday involving several communists and gendarmes. Yesterday morning, two gendarmes discovered four cyclists behaving suspiciously arriving in a small village near Thenain. The gendarmes stepped forward and asked them to show their identification cards, but one of them suddenly pulled out two guns from his pocket and shot at the gendarmes. The gendarmes returned fire, but neither side hit each other. The cyclists then split into two groups and fled.

### The Full Picture of Australia (1) - A Comprehensive Simple Description

The future direction of the Southwest Pacific War depends on Japan or Australia. This newspaper has already compiled a special issue on India, providing a systematic introduction. Now, we will provide a comprehensive simple description of various aspects of Australia.

Some historians have studied historical records and gathered 19 reasons for the fall of the ancient Roman Empire. In fact, there are more than 19 factors in the rise and fall of a nation. Factors such as geography, race, politics, climate, economy, population, health, and religion are also important. The development of Australia is no exception to these factors. Now, we will discuss some of the most important factors below.

The Largest Island, the Smallest Continent

Australia is an abbreviation for the Commonwealth of Australia, comprising the Australian continent and Tasmania. It is bordered by the Timor Sea and the Arafura Sea to the north, the Indian Ocean to the west, and faces the Bass Strait and the Southern Ocean to the south. It is the largest island on Earth and the smallest continent: 2,400 miles long from east to west, 1,971 miles wide from north to south, and an area of 2,974,581 square miles, about the same size as the United States.

The eastern part of the continent is mountainous, the western part is a gravelly plateau, and between them is a vast plain. On the island of Tasmania, off the southern end, mountain ranges overlap, and lakes are scattered. In the eastern part of the continent, there is a mountain range that starts from the coast of Victoria in the south, extends north, and ends at Cape York in the north. The names of this mountain range include the Australian Alps, the Blue Mountains, the New England Range, the Great Dividing Range, and the Coastal Range, varying by region. They are collectively called the Great Dividing Range. The southern part of the mountain range is relatively high and steep. The highest peak is Mount Kosciuszko, near the border of New South Wales and Victoria, about 7,300 feet high. In the western plateau area of the continent, the mountains are discontinuous, and there are no famous large mountains.

The most famous river on the continent is the Murray River, which originates in the Australian Alps, flows through the southeastern plain, and enters the Indian Ocean. It is about 1,100 kilometers long and is the only long river in Australia. As for lakes, there are many inland salt lakes in the south and west. The largest is Lake Eyre, which covers about 10,000 square kilometers.

White People Exclude Australian Aborigines

Australia has always been known as "virgin land yet to be cultivated." The population is about 7.8 million, averaging less than three people per square mile. The population is denser in the southeast, sparser along the coast, and the most sparse in the interior. It can be said that the land is vast and the population is sparse. 86% of the residents are white people born in Australia, and 97% of the total population are of English descent. It is estimated that about 7 million people. Overseas Chinese in Australia mostly migrated there after the discovery of gold mines. At its peak, there were about 60,000 people. Later, Australia strictly implemented "White Australia Policy," restricting immigration, and those who migrated earlier were also discriminated against. The number of overseas Chinese was drastically reduced and is now less than 20,000. As for the aborigines of Australia, the Australian Aborigines, they have been driven out, and their numbers are decreasing daily. Today, including mixed-race aborigines, there are only 75,000 people left, of whom about 29,000 are nomadic tribes, still living in remote areas of the interior and the north, not yet civilized, living as in the Stone Age, using stone knives and stone axes. Most of the other aborigines have been hired on ranches or work in government-run places. The aborigines of Tasmania have become extinct. These aborigines have extremely low knowledge. Except for wooden leaves covering their waists, their whole bodies are naked. They eat grass roots, birds, beasts, fish, insects, and the small black people of Africa. They are the most pitiful people in the world.

The ancestors of the white Australians of English descent were the so-called adventurous Englishmen and British criminals. Originally, in 1769, Englishman Cook followed in the footsteps of the Portuguese, Spanish, and Dutch to explore Oceania and arrived in New Zealand. The following year, Cook sailed along the coast and arrived at the fertile region of the east coast of the Australian continent, raised the British flag, and then advanced north along the continent, landing in the Torres Strait. This was the beginning of British occupation and colonization of Australia. In 1778, Britain used Australia as a place to exile criminals, and a large number of serious offenders were continuously deported to Australia. In 1788, the city of Sydney was established as a base for colonization. In 1795, free migration was allowed, and agriculture and animal husbandry gradually flourished.

In 1851, gold mines were discovered in Australia, and the number of people migrating to Australia from various places suddenly increased, and the trend of racial complexity also increased day by day. The sentiment of "White Australia" began to grow at this time. From 1880 to 1890, more and more foreigners migrated to Australia, and the sentiment of "White Australia" became even more vigorous. In 1901, Australia combined with Tasmania to form a federation and established a federal government, implementing immigration laws, which were vigorously promoted. In 1906, Asian colored overseas Chinese, Japanese and overseas Chinese were repatriated, of course, bearing the brunt. The foundation of the "White Australia" policy was laid, creating the situation today where almost all white people in Australia are of English descent.

Australians deeply abhor racial mixing, so the government, people, and all political parties, regardless of their political views or economic status, adhere to the "White Australia" policy. One reason is economic, because employing colored laborers with a low standard of living endangers the living standards of white people, so Australia most welcomes English-speaking people to colonize and invest in development. Australians have also written many books listing the necessity of dividing races and not mixing them. The deep-rootedness of racial concepts can be imagined. Racial mixing like in the southern United States is seen as a great danger by Australians, but Americans don't care about it. Among the British colonies, the only place where the residents are most purely of English descent, apart from New Zealand, is Australia. Serious infectious diseases are rarely found in Australia and New Zealand, so they are known as the healthiest countries in the world. The mortality rate is only 9 per thousand, which is much lower than the 12.3 per thousand in Britain and the 11.5 per thousand in the United States. And only 38 out of every thousand babies die in Australia, and the mortality rate is lower than any other country (except New Zealand).

A Corner of Melbourne

Melbourne, the capital of Australia, was established only a century ago. Through the efforts of the British, it has become a prosperous city. The city is clean, the buildings are magnificent, and the population is over one million. A corner of downtown Melbourne is shown, with river water and reflections, making people feel relaxed and fascinated.

### Perpetrator of Heydrich Assassination Still Not Found

Bern, 2nd (Havas Agency) - Basel News Agency's Berlin correspondent reports that after the assassination of Heydrich, acting governor of the Czech Protectorate, the German government has decided that until anti-German elements are eliminated, it will treat Czechs with brutality. Czechs now have only two options: one is to cooperate with Germany without restriction, and the other is to ignore worldly affairs and stand idly by. However, those who adopt the second attitude must work for Germany and abandon all delusional cooperation with the Czech government in exile in London. Special courts have been established in Bohemia and Moravia to eliminate reactionaries in order to find the truth about the Heydrich assassination. Reactionaries are divided into the following categories: 1. Accomplices; 2. Those who sympathize with the crime; 3. Those who disrupt order and security and incite labor unrest; 4. Those who have relations with Czechs overseas, especially the Czech government in London. However, the perpetrator of the crime has not yet been found.

### German-Turkish Relations: The Two Countries Sign Economic Agreement; German Foreign Ministry Issues Commentary

Berlin, 2nd (Havas Agency) - Regarding the German-Turkish economic agreement, the German Foreign Ministry recently issued a semi-official communique, commenting that Germany has always admired the revolutionary spirit of Kemal Atatürk in creating a new Turkey and recognizes Turkey as the guardian of the Dardanelles Strait. For centuries, the relations between Germany and Turkey have been cordial, and there have been no conflicts of interest. Germany is currently fighting against the Soviet Union, which is why it is relieving Turkey of Soviet pressure. From an economic point of view, Germany's new European plan is also extremely beneficial to Turkey. All of Turkey's export goods can be sold in Europe without any problems. In contrast, Britain and the United States are by no means Turkey's largest markets. In addition, political figures here refused to comment on the details of this economic agreement and its political development, only saying that the enemy will be shocked after the German-Turkish agreement is reached. It can be asserted that.

### Back Door Rice Sales Exceed Price Limits and Quantities; Two Rice Shops Fined; Violation of Regulations Should Result in Immediate License Revocation; Permission Granted to Convert to Fines of 5,000 Yuan Each

The Shanghai Municipal Council Intelligence Office announced that Tongji Rice Shop at 60 Baidun Road was found to have sold rice through the back door, exceeding the prescribed quantity; Yuanshun Rice Shop at 729 Wenshi Road was found to have sold rice above the price limit and quantity, and also outside the prescribed hours; and Taishan Rice Shop at 68 Henan Road was found to have sold rice exceeding the prescribed quantity, all of which violated the Bureau's regulations and greatly affected the interests of the citizens. Strict action should be taken. The licenses of the shops have been revoked as punishment, but they were allowed to convert this to a fine of 5,000 yuan each. The rice shops have already paid the amounts. In the future, any rice shop found to have similar violations will be severely punished.

Rice Queue Crushing Fine of Five Yuan

Since the Public Concession's various police stations implemented the queue numbering system, many people were again detained yesterday for forcefully pushing into the queue, and fined five yuan. It is hoped that the crowding situation will be slightly reduced. At the same time, it is hoped that the rice-buying public will strictly observe order to avoid punishment.

### Rental Disputes: Amicable Mediation

Sixty Subletters

Fined for Not Obtaining Licenses

Since the implementation of sublet housing licensing on April 1, a total of 41,600 houses have been licensed by the end of last month. The Office for the Implementation of Sublet License Regulations has been paying attention to the implementation of licensing. During the last week of last month, personnel were dispatched to the licensing venues to investigate whether the license regulations regarding rent adjustment were being observed. Sixty subletters, after being warned, still delayed obtaining licenses, and were fined from 20 to 150 yuan each. The Office for the Implementation of Sublet License Regulations has received 125 complaints regarding rent disputes, of which 45% were complaints of excessive rent collection, and 22% were complaints of being ordered to move out. About 20% of rent disputes were mediated. Although the Office has no jurisdiction over cases of being ordered to move out, 12% were mediated. In addition, two cases of demanding tips for transferring houses were found and prosecuted. As a result, one defendant was sentenced to 15 days of detention, and another defendant is in custody, with the hearing postponed.

The Central Police Station's Chinese detective Qian Xianting received a report the day before yesterday stating that Qingfeng Silver Shop at 405 Hankou Road was specifically commissioning small money shops to purchase silver coins, silver quarters, copper coins, etc., to melt them into ingots for resale, which seriously violated regulations. He went to make an arrest, and the shop owner Wu Caisheng, from Jiangxi, and shop assistants Chen Changnian, Wan Faxing, and Li Yunzeng were arrested.

### Anti-Epidemic Campaign: Coming to an End Soon

Citizens Should Get Injected as Soon as Possible

Typhoid Fever: Nine out of Ten Cases are Fatal. It is learned that the number of people in the city who have been vaccinated against cholera will soon reach two million. According to statistics, 1,061,000 people have been vaccinated by the health authorities of the two concessions. If the number of people vaccinated by the Japanese and Chinese authorities is included, the total number is no less than 1.8 million. The Health Department of the French Municipal Council has vaccinated a total of 428,384 people since April. In the past two months, the Health Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council has administered cholera injections to more than 600,000 people. It is said that the health campaign to prevent cholera will continue until the crisis is deemed to have subsided.

Urgent Deadline; Inject Promptly

After the Shanghai Municipal Council announced the day before yesterday that the Public Concession's cholera prevention campaign would be scaled down starting on the 13th of this month, the weather was poor yesterday, but citizens were still eager to take advantage of these last few days to rush to the health centers for these vaccinations. The Shanghai Municipal Council warned the public that in order to avoid the trouble of being corrected later when found without a vaccination certificate, all citizens who have not been vaccinated and do not have a vaccination certificate should go to the various health centers in the Concession for vaccination before the 13th of this month. Children over the age of six should be taken by their parents or guardians for vaccination.

Typhoid Crisis Extremely Serious

According to a report by Mr. Jordan, Director of the Health Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council, the number of deaths from typhoid fever last week was very high. Fifty-three out of fifty-six patients died, with a mortality rate of ninety-six percent. In addition, six Chinese people suffered from paralytic typhoid fever, of whom four died. In addition, the medical authorities discovered thirty-two cases of plague among Chinese people, with eleven deaths. One foreigner died from this disease. According to the health authorities, both typhoid fever and plague are easily transmitted. Citizens should inoculate themselves with typhoid vaccines and stay away from people with fleas to avoid the spread of this autumn epidemic. Plague is mostly transmitted by fleas. Vagrants are everywhere on the roads, undressing and catching fleas, which must be avoided.

### This Morning's Tram Departure Delay; Reason

According to the News Agency, when the trams of the Public Concession departed from the factory at 6 am yesterday, the company announced that ticket sellers would not accept banknotes of the Central Bank issued in 1940. At that time, the ticket sellers believed that if the banknotes were rejected, passengers would inevitably have no banknotes to use, because the banknotes of the Central Bank were not used by farmers, etc., and there was a shortage of banknotes in the market. Most of the banknotes in circulation were banknotes of the Central Bank issued in 1940. Moreover, it would easily cause various disputes between passengers and ticket sellers, so they asked the company authorities to withdraw the order. The company authorities also realized that the difficulty was indeed a fact, so they withdrew the proposal. The ticket sellers began to work on the trams at about 8 am, but the departure time of the trams on all routes had been delayed by two hours.

### Taking the Opportunity to Raise Prices; Suppression Will Be Implemented; Price Changes Not Based on Prescribed Ratios; Shanghai Municipal Council and Others Repeatedly Discussed Countermeasures

According to the Allied Press, the reserve currency will soon be fully implemented in the Shanghai Concessions, but many people are changing old legal tender prices to reserve currency prices at improper ratios. In addition, many prices that have historically been based on old legal tender are also being raised arbitrarily. Price alignment should be implemented as soon as possible. The authorities are already preparing for it. Currently, the Shanghai Municipal Council, the Xingya Institute, the Finance Officer's Office of the Central China Liaison Department, etc., have repeatedly discussed specific methods to suppress prices, and are actively working on it. It is expected that after the full exchange is completed on June 8, various agencies will work together to implement it decisively.

### New Electricity Bill Payment Method in the French Concession; Implemented This Afternoon

The French-owned Electricity Company in this city specially notified all users in the French Concession that it will stop accepting old legal tender from the afternoon of the 4th of this month. At the same time, checks of the same type will also be stopped.

### Lectures of Rong Wu Society

At the 19th Yijing lecture of the Rong Wu Lecture Society, Mr. Yang Zhenru lectured on "The Mystery of the Ce Shu". He said that the number of Qian is 216, and the number of Kun is 144. Now, let's add the three numbers 216, and the result is 9. Adding the three numbers 144, the result is also 9. Adding 9 and 9, the result is 18. Adding 1 and 8 again, the result is still 9. The numbers of Qian and Kun are each divided into 9, and the total is 9. The number that cannot be chaotic is the position. Those who have a little knowledge of numbers all know that hundreds, tens, and ones each have their own position, which cannot be mixed. However, the numbers of the Ce are naturally combined without being strange, because there is its own precise method. There are 64 hexagrams in the Yijing. Among them, 12 hexagrams are the same as other numbers of Ce for necessary reasons. Therefore, the hexagram numbers are actually 52. Among these 52 numbers, the numbers of all the wrong hexagrams are 9. There are 32 nines in the 64 hexagrams. 9 times 32 is 288. Adding 288, the number is still 9. If we calculate the 52 numbers incorrectly, there are 26 nines. 9 times 26 is 234. Adding 234, the number is still 9. The number of days in the period is 360. Adding 3 and 6, the result is 9. The numbers of the two chapters are 11,520. Adding 1152, the result is still 9. These eight numbers are all divisible by 9, so we know that all that is contained in one number is 9. If we reverse and mix the numbers, expand them into 36 styles, the number contained in each one is all 9. Not only that, adding the unit of Qian, 6, and the unit of Kun, 4, the result is 10. Adding the tens digit of Qian, 1, and the tens digit of Kun, 4, the result is 5. Adding the two digits of the tens and ones of Qian, the result is 7. Adding the two digits of the tens and ones of Kun, the result is 8. Adding 7 and 8, and removing the integer 10, the result is 5. Adding the two digits of the hundreds and ones of Qian, the result is 8. Adding the two digits of the hundreds and ones of Kun, the result is 5. Adding 8 and 5 roughly, and removing the integer 10, the result is 3. Adding the two digits of the hundreds and sevens of Qian, the result is 3. Adding the two digits of the hundreds and twelves of Kun, the result is 5. Adding 3 and 5, the result is 8. Qian and Kun are like this, and all 64 hexagrams are the same. It cannot be said to be accidental. We call the unit of Qian 6, and the unit of Kun 4, because the upper three lines of the two hexagrams are in one of the four cardinal directions, and the two lines of Qian are Yang, and the two lines of Kun are Yin. The units of the other hexagrams are 6 or 4, all according to this condition. Six and four are like this, and the conditions of the other numbers are the same. The variation of the former is like that, and the unremitting of the latter is like this. Melting ice and charcoal in one furnace, it does not lose its integrity. The numbers of the Ce are truly miraculous. Then Mr. Yang Zhongyi explained the mystery of Taiji's use of the center. The numbers of the Ce of the three-line eight trigrams are the same as the numbers of the Ce of the six-line image hexagrams, proving that they are repeated.

### Several Textile Mills Will Soon Partially Resume Operations; Difficulty in Supplying Coal, Factories Switch to Using Firewood; Factories Manufacturing Bicycle Parts Are Extremely Busy

The Shanghai Municipal Council's Industrial and Social Affairs Department reported for May that several large textile mills were returned to Chinese owners last month, and some of them will soon be able to partially resume operations. At that time, the industrial situation in this city will be seen to improve. In the past three months, the Industrial Section has sent staff to inspect the working conditions of 1,400 factories, of which about half are in operation. Some factories have been able to obtain raw materials and have therefore resumed operations. The supply of coal is still difficult, and the price has been increasing. It is said that some factories are now using firewood as fuel. Among the machine factories currently in operation, about half are engaged in the manufacture of bicycle parts. One large machine factory is trying to manufacture the main axles with castings. Rubber factories are busy manufacturing rubber parts for bicycles, such as tires, pedals, and brake pads. Recently, a number of machine factories have stopped work, but the two technical training schools established by the Bureau for young workers are still actively teaching. Representatives of 18 medium-sized factories met once last month, and as a result, they decided to jointly fund a medical clinic to benefit the workers. This is the second time since six coal briquette factories jointly established a similar clinic this year. The Industrial Section mediated a total of six labor disputes, of which four were due to workers' requests for repatriation allowances, and one each due to the dismissal of workers and requests for severance pay.

### Central China Bank Notes; Exchange Starts from the 8th; Another Exchange Office Set Up in the French Concession

The method for recovering old currency is scheduled to start on the 8th of this month. Shanghai and Nanjing in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui will start exchanging at the same time. The old currency issued by the Central China and Communications Banks will be exchanged at a ratio of two to one. In addition to the 82 member banks and money exchange shops that have agreed to exchange Central Reserve Certificates on behalf of the Shanghai branch of the Central Reserve Bank, the Shanghai branch's office in the western district of Shanghai and the office in the French Concession will first establish old currency exchange offices on the 8th. It is learned that a portion of the Central Reserve Certificates supplied for exchange has been shipped to Shanghai. Yesterday, the Central China Bank and Communications Bank sent the new remittance checks required by the Joint Reserve Committee of the Banking Industry to the Silver Union for exchange for cash. As for the Central Reserve Certificates for the banks to exchange old currency on behalf, they will be paid before the 7th, according to the number of old currency in stock reported by each bank, and the amount applied for exchange on behalf, in accordance with the methods for banks to exchange old currency on behalf.

### Boat Merchant Cheated While Socializing

Zhang Linsheng, a 52-year-old native of Ningbo, who lives at 82 Yuejie Street in the French Concession, has been in the lighter business. Over half a century old, he likes romance. Recently, because his wife is pregnant, Zhang often seeks pleasure outside. At about 10 pm on the 30th of last month, Zhang walked alone to Minti Ni Yin Road and met a Wuxi prostitute, Gu Adou, who is 24 years old. They talked to each other and fell in love at first sight. They went to Room 19 of the Xiangrong Hotel at 393 Edowa Road for illicit sex. In the middle of the night, the prostitute had bad intentions. While Zhang was sleeping soundly, she stole his wallet from his pocket and fled. When Zhang woke up, he was empty-handed and called out in vain. The day before yesterday evening, Zhang found the prostitute Gu near Baxian Bridge and dragged her to the police station to retrieve the stolen goods.

### Child Gambler Committed Suicide After Losing

Shi Sun Yongfu, a 17-year-old male from Ningbo, who lived at 24 Alley 279, Fuli Road, his father was doing business in another port, and no one was in charge of him. At such an age, he was addicted to gambling. He often took the clothes and belongings at home to pawn and lost a lot of money. The day before yesterday, he was scolded by his mother, which caused him to become mentally disordered. He had the idea of committing suicide and jumped from the drying platform on the third floor at 2 pm one afternoon, injuring his head. He was sent to the hospital and died. The police station took him to the morgue for examination. Yesterday, his mother, Sun Xu, collected the body for examination.

The style is novel, the ride is convenient, and its characteristics are that the body is strong and not afraid of collision. The appearance of the car is shown in the attached picture.

### Indian Friends

— Yu Xin'en

The Indians one sees on the Shanghai streets are invariably those so-called "red-headed Ah Sans" with turbans and full beards. Their esteemed occupations are either street police or doormen, leading people to believe that all Indians, in their attire and duties, are no different from these, as if they were born to be Ah Sans.

No wonder that in America and Europe, the Chinese people one often encounters are unkempt and look malnourished, and their businesses are either laundry shops or restaurants. Thus, people are led to believe that all Chinese are like this, as if they were born with this inherent specialization.

This is a classic case of "sitting in a well and looking at the sky," which is hardly surprising.

In reality, many Indians possess high levels of education and skills; it is simply that their international status is different, preventing them from being on the same level playing field.

Traveling from Shanghai to Europe by ship not only involves the transition of seasonal climates from clear winter to summer but also encounters different races. When departing from Shanghai in winter, the ship's staff and attendants all wear black wool uniforms, but once past Hong Kong, they all change into summer white clothing, only reverting to winter attire after reaching the Mediterranean. Within this journey filled with summer colors, India and its people are present, and thus, the acquaintance with Indian friends begins.

The presence of the Indian race during this journey begins in Singapore. From Shanghai to Hong Kong to Singapore, it's all the world of the Chinese, but their numbers are ultimately not many. After leaving Singapore, the ship suddenly transforms into an Indian world. Originally, the seating in the dining room was scattered, but at this moment, the tables are fully occupied, lively, noisy, and busy all at once. I hadn't tasted a decent meal in quite a while, and now curry rice appears, catered to the Indian passengers since they constitute the majority and indeed make the ship a profitable enterprise.

From Singapore to Colombo, down to Mumbai, Indian passengers are the main clientele. Mumbai is India's gateway, a city of prosperity, densely populated, and a center of culture and commerce, so the ship stays there for a relatively long time. The ship is one of the largest mail ships, conducting a large volume of business with Indians each year. Therefore, on the evening of the stay in Mumbai, the ship is adorned with colorful lights, hosting a banquet to entertain the city's elite women, with champagne and dancing in full swing. All one sees here are elegantly dressed, high-class Indian ladies; where would you find the turban and long beard that remind you of the Ah San?

Heading west from Mumbai, the ship presents a scene of desolation once again. The peak of the Indian world has come to an end. The seating in the dining room returns to being scattered, like the autumn weather before the arrival of winter.

Although there are many Indians on the journey from Singapore to Mumbai, most of them belong to the middle and lower classes, and their trips are short. Although there are many opportunities to meet, it's hard to befriend them, and there's also the regret of language barriers. The Indians who board the ship from Mumbai, however, belong to the educated class and are all going to England, some to study, some to take exams, and some to do business. Naturally, they all speak excellent English, so they can chat and laugh with their fellow passengers.

Among them was an Indian doctor who was going to Cairo for the World Medical Association conference. After learning that I was also going to the same destination, he introduced himself and we became acquainted. Not long after we met, he asked me to come to his cabin and voluntarily opened his bags one by one for me to see. He had brought many valuable items, such as expensive cameras, and he showed them all to me, also showing me how much money he had and how it was divided among the bags. This seemed like an unexpected display of friendship. Such candor upon first acquaintance is rare even in Chinese friendships. However, during our conversations, since we were ultimately traveling together, it was not difficult to understand the other person's knowledge and to infer their background. He had studied in England and also obtained a specialized degree, so in theory, his candor should not have any ulterior motives.

However, I had no previous experience of befriending Indians, and one must be cautious during travel. Some friends had been deceived by Indian passengers on this journey.

We also talked about international issues. The Indian doctor did not consider their black skin to make them second-class citizens. He brought up a speech by an Indian scholar: "Ladies and gentlemen, I know you don't want to look at me, because my skin is black, and my appearance is ugly; but I guarantee that my brain is as white as yours. But why do I have black skin, an ugly appearance? I don't know; ask your God!"

On the ship, no matter how crowded the passengers are, Europeans and Americans will never be put in the same cabin with Chinese or Indians. It's like a kind of privilege. Some people get a cabin to themselves all the way to the mainland, while others have to squeeze together.

Finally, we arrived at Port Said. From Port Said, we took a train to Cairo. We arrived in Cairo in the evening, and at the Indian doctor's introduction, we stayed at the same hotel, with our rooms next to each other. After settling our luggage, we went to bed in order to attend the conference the next morning.

The next morning at ten o'clock, a grand opening ceremony was held at the Egyptian Academy, inaugurated by King Farouk I of Egypt. I woke up around eight o'clock, but I didn't hear any movement in the Indian doctor's room. Could he still be sound asleep or had he already gone out? If so, he should have woken me up to go together. So I knocked on his door, but there was no sound. The door was locked, and looking through the crack, it was pitch black, as if the room had been unoccupied for a long time. At that moment, I was a little suspicious. Could I have been deceived and he had disappeared without a trace? But I knocked on the door again, and after a long time, I faintly heard a sound. When the door opened, the room was dark, with the windows tightly closed. I quickly opened the windows, and the Indian doctor was pale, then started vomiting, clearly due to a lack of fresh air. But what puzzled me was that a highly educated doctor would not leave even a small crack for breathing when sleeping.

After the conference, we took the same ship and disembarked in Venice. From Venice, we took a train to continue our journey. While rushing onto the train in Italy, the Indian doctor injured his leg. I applied medicine and bandaged it for him, and he was very grateful for my help. After four hours on the train together, we had to part ways, as I was going to Switzerland and he was going to England. So he got off the train first, transferring to another route. He asked for my address, as he didn't have a fixed address yet, planning to write to me later.

A long time has passed, and I am still staying on the mainland, but there is no news from him. By the time I arrived in England, he had already returned to his country.

In England, especially in London, the opportunity to meet Indians is not uncommon. Often on the street, around mealtime, one would smell a strong curry aroma, immediately thinking of curry chicken and curry rice. This is an Indian restaurant. In London, the Indians who are doing business or studying are relatively wealthy. Indians in England receive the same treatment as the English, unlike Americans who refuse to sit, walk, or dine with blacks. However, the English still cannot do it as thoroughly as the French. Once, I heard a discussion on BBC radio about how the French assimilate with blacks in the colonies, thereby gaining their loyalty and goodwill. This may be the case. In Paris, it is common to see whites and blacks walking hand in hand, but in London, I have never seen this.

In the hospital where I worked, an Indian doctor was later added as an assistant. Due to our colleagueship, we became friends. Sometimes we went out to visit places together. Once, walking on the street, he was in front of me and I noticed that his sock had a large hole and that there were also holes in the cuffs of his coat. I laughed and asked him why he was so frugal. He also laughed and said that his money was all taken by England. In India, even among Indian doctors, those who have been to England, taken exams, and obtained British degrees are valued and paid more, but still far less than British doctors in India. However, everyone seeks opportunities to go to England to take exams, and more than half of the candidates in each exam are Indian doctors. This Indian doctor was no exception. He spent a lot of pounds sterling to go to England, and in addition to food, clothing, and lodging, he had to spend a lot of money to attend research classes, listen to lectures, practice, and finally pay a dozen pounds in exam fees. It is rare luck to pass the exam once. The second time is half a year apart. Many take the exam three, four, or five times. Those who pass obtain a royal degree, but are already penniless.

A week before the Indian doctor left England to return to his country, we traveled to a place together. In the evening, he invited me to eat Indian food at his residence - the Indian Youth Association - and took me to tour the club for a week.

I arranged to bid him farewell the second night at a Chinese restaurant. In the afternoon, his friend called to say that he was sick - his migraine had recurred, so we had to reschedule. I was very busy those days because he was gone, and I had to work harder. The next day, I took the time to visit him, only to find that the building was empty and he was gone.

The houses seen in India all have their doors wide open, with everything visible at a glance, and the streets are crowded with people. This is probably a unique phenomenon of the tropics. It's like when I first went to Switzerland, it was winter, and the windows of each house were tightly closed and covered with a layer of white frost, and there were few pedestrians on the streets, as quiet as a dead city. The second time I went to Switzerland, it was summer. The streets were bustling with pedestrians, and ice cream wrappers were scattered on the ground. The hot and cold weather has its own special characteristics. Perhaps the friendship of tropical people is also like this, as thorough and clear as open houses, as if there is no need for further in-depth inquiry.

Four others, including Lin Siqing, Sun Meitao, Zhou Jianming, and Chen Shugang, were injured. It is understood that the incident was caused by a quarrel over a dancing girl, leading to a mob beating. The police arrested Lou Minwei, the ballroom manager from Ningbo, and two tea servers, Shao Amao and Zhao Jingen, and detained them for further investigation after examining Chen Yunlai's body.

### Eager Collection of Repatriation Certificates from the Public Works Department

Approximately 3,000 Certificates Issued Daily

Prices in Shanghai are soaring endlessly, making life increasingly difficult for the people. The number of those unable to make a living is increasing daily. Some of those who have homes in the countryside are returning home one after another, leading to a sharp increase in the number of people obtaining repatriation certificates from the Public Works Department recently. According to a report from the Datong News Agency, the number of people collecting certificates is around 3,000 per day, and the number of group passes obtained directly from the Chinese Evacuation Committee is also over several hundred per day.

The procedure for issuing civic certificates for the Public Concession, after being changed to direct handling by the police stations, has been delayed due to the large number of applications. It is hoped that the first batch of civic certificates, totaling about 10,000, will be issued within this week.

The Public Works Department's visa office continues to issue temporary civic passes. This temporary pass allows entry and exit from the Shanghai Concession's peripheral security buffer zone, so there are many applicants. Its validity expires at the end of this month.

### Emergency Meeting of the Pawn Broking Industry: Redemption Measures

The Shanghai Pawn Broking Trade Association held an emergency meeting yesterday at 3:00 PM at its clubhouse on Baker Road to adjust the currency system for redeeming pawned goods. More than 30 companies, including Ruitai, Shunchang, Jiuda, Hongyu, and Shengchang, attended, chaired by Zheng Zhongping. The following resolutions were passed:

*   If the customers are unable to redeem their goods within the period, they can renew the original ticket, pay the interest, and have the pawnshop exchange it for a reserve note pawn ticket at a ratio of two to one.
*   If the redemption period is exceeded by ten days, the goods must be redeemed with reserve notes at the prevailing exchange rate at the time of pawn.

### Broker Kidnapped

Li Rongliang, a Soochow native who works as a socks broker, resides on the second floor of 125 Meng Shenfu Road, at the Eight Immortals Bridge Small Vegetable Market in the French Concession. He is 38 years old. At around 8:00 AM on the morning of the 2nd, while he was sound asleep, three unexpected guests, all dressed in Western suits, suddenly barged into the room. Without asking any questions, one of them dragged Li out and kidnapped him, and his whereabouts are unknown. Afterwards, his family reported to the police, who are investigating, but there is still no information.

### Trucks Using Gasoline Substitutes Are Allowed

According to the Public Works Department's Information Office, the authorities of the two concessions have issued an announcement stating that trucks burning gasoline substitutes are now allowed to be used if they have a transportation permit from the relevant authorities. The fee for the transportation permit is set at 10 storage currency units per day for transporting unregulated goods and 25 storage currency units per day for transporting controlled goods (except rice, flour, corn, corn flour, coal, and coal balls). If calculated monthly, the fee is 200 storage currency units for transporting unregulated goods, and an additional 25 storage currency units per day are charged if the vehicle transports controlled goods.

### 300 Suffering Children in the Youyou Kindergarten Plead for Support

Since the food problem in Shanghai has become increasingly serious, the Youyou Kindergarten and Orphanage on Kaifeng Road has dismissed some of its students. Currently, there are a total of 250 children remaining in the orphanage, including 235 boys and 15 girls, aged 6 to 18. All are orphaned children, with separate dormitories for the girls.

Meals

The meals for the entire orphanage were originally delivered by the Minsheng Convenience Cafeteria, but now a new boiler has been donated by a philanthropist for self-cooking. Recently, since the source of food has become insufficient, it has been reduced to two meals a day, with corn as the main food, accounting for about 70%, and the rest being broken indica rice. As for the cost of vegetables, it is only 3 storage currency units per child per day, so they can only eat some vegetables. As for the children, in addition to attending classes and participating in production work and labor service, there are also extracurricular activities.

Work

In addition to expanding the original weaving workshop, the orphanage has recently opened a flour milling workshop, and children in the middle and high grades must participate in this work. The time spent on work is equal to the time spent in class, in order to achieve the principle of half-work and half-study. The products of its weaving workshop are of excellent quality and are praised by the society. There is a retail outlet on Xinzha Road, with a daily income of about 100 storage currency units. The flour milling workshop was originally intended to grind corn flour for sale, but due to the difficulty of obtaining the source, it is now only used to supply food for the orphanage's staff and students. Recently, two workshops for weaving nets and making straw sandals are also planned.

Economy

As for the orphanage's economic situation, according to Chairman Zhang Wenkui, the monthly allowance provided by the Refugee Relief Association has been suspended since January of this year, and prices in Shanghai have soared several times over. With a large number of students and huge expenses for food and other items, if a solution is not found quickly, 300 suffering children will be displaced and fall into the abyss of hunger. At present, in addition to trying to disperse some of the students in order to reduce the orphanage's expenses, a solicitation for donations is being made to all sectors of society for one month, with a target of 150,000 storage currency units.

### Unregistered Doctors Are Not Allowed to Administer Vaccinations

According to the Public Works Department's Information Office, the Public Concession authorities do not recognize vaccination certificates issued by unregistered practicing physicians and will prosecute such doctors in accordance with Rule 43 of the Land Regulations. Registered physicians must sign their names in their own handwriting on such certificates, and also write in regular script the spelling of their names as recorded in the physician's registration records. Otherwise, the bureau may refuse to accept the certificate, causing great inconvenience to those who need to exchange it for a certificate. All doctors are requested to pay attention to this requirement.

Committing Suicide by Taking Poison Due to Family Disputes

Zhang Guangli, a native of Qingjiang, 51 years old, lives at 46 Hongfuli, Nicheng Bridge, Xinzha Road. He works as a coolie at the X number wharf. Yesterday afternoon at around 1:00 PM, he had a quarrel with his son over trivial family matters. Afterwards, he was overwhelmed by grief and swallowed the poisonous product Baihua. He was discovered and rushed to Tongren Hospital for treatment. Miao Meiying, a young woman from Jiangyin, 38 years old, lives at 12 Yuzhenli, at the intersection of Lafayette Road and Ma Lang Road in the French Concession. Yesterday afternoon at around 1:45 PM, she swallowed poisonous liquid and medicine in a fit of despondency due to family discord. She was rushed to Tongren Hospital and transferred to Guangren Hospital for treatment.

### Foreign Passports: Urgent Call for Complete Return

The English-language "Ta Mei Wan Bao" reported that Kawasaki, a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy, requested at a press conference with news reporters yesterday that all foreigners completely return all passports obtained from the Japanese Consulate General. The Passport Office of the Japanese Consulate General had previously urged the return of these passports, but a large number had not yet been returned. However, these passports have long lost their effectiveness for the holders. Therefore, the Japanese Consulate General sincerely hopes that all foreigners will quickly return these passports to the Passport Office at the Richard Hotel on Huangpu Road.

### Shoe Factory Owner Accused of Violating Female Employee

Su Minqing, a Wenzhou native who owns the Oumei Shoe Factory at 14 Lane 475, Qiaqing Road, employs two female employees in his shop, one surnamed Liang and the other named Chen Shuying, 29 years old, from Guangdong. She was introduced to Su's company to work in March of this year. Unexpectedly, recently, Chen's parents, Chen Yue and Chen Liangshi (residents of 4 Lane 431, Meibai Grid Road), suddenly accused Su of raping their daughter and causing her pregnancy. On the afternoon of the 1st of this month, they invited Su with relatives Huang Jilin, Lin Dacheng, and Chen Liangshi to negotiate at the Jingshuitai Teahouse at 6 Xinzha Road, demanding medical expenses of 10,000 storage currency units. Su was unable to agree at the time, and in addition to paying 1,000 yuan in cash, he also issued a check for 9,000 yuan, but had reported the matter to the Xinzha Police Station beforehand, who sent Detective Chen Lianjing to arrest Chen Zhongyue and the other four, accusing them of extortion. The matter was prosecuted. Yesterday morning, Su denied the rape, but Chen Shuying confessed that they had been intimate more than ten times since March 18 and that she was now pregnant. Since Su was also found to have been at fault, both parties were released on bail pending further investigation.

### Accused by His Fiancée Due to Recent Bereavement and Inability to Marry

Cai Zhenxing, a French-owned Thunder Company employee from Guangdong, resides at 38 Dongxinli, Median Road in the French Concession. He was previously accused by his fiancée, Yu Huaimin (a 21-year-old graduate of Aiguo Girls' High School), and her mother, Yu Lushi, of assault and battery to the French Concession authorities. Yesterday, Cai was summoned to court. He claimed that on the 16th of last month, Yu Huaimin and her mother led a group of people to cause trouble and took away a diamond ring worth more than 2,000 yuan from his table. Neighbors were aware of this. As for Yu's previous accusation that he had an improper relationship with Ms. Xu Daiping, Ms. Xu is a neighbor of many years and was clearly intentionally slandered for other purposes. The cause of this dispute was that Yu Huaimin and her mother repeatedly urged him to marry, but his parents had recently passed away and he was unable to marry, leading to resentment and the filing of this false accusation. He requested permission to file a counterclaim for false accusation. As the case still needed investigation, he was dismissed and ordered to await further review.

### Two Batches of American Nationals to Arrive in Shanghai, Evacuation in Mid-June; Representatives to Be Sent to the Exchange Location in East Africa

Kawasaki, a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy, announced at a press conference with news reporters yesterday that several more batches of Allied nationals who are evacuating will arrive in Shanghai at the end of this week to await evacuation from Shanghai in mid-June.

Two Batches of American Nationals Arrive in Shanghai This Weekend

A batch of American nationals has already arrived in Shanghai from Hainan Island, and another 67 American nationals are scheduled to arrive here from Qingdao, Weihaiwei, Yantai, and Jinan in North China this weekend. 53 American nationals from Nanjing and its nearby areas are also expected to arrive around the same time. In addition, two batches of American nationals, totaling 158 people, will go to Japan this week to board a special transport ship for evacuation. It is reported that the special transport ship will also stop at Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Saigon on its way to its destination.

American and Japanese Representatives to Be Sent to the Exchange Location

As for Allied nationals other than Americans, such as British and Dutch nationals, they are not included in this exchange and evacuation of nationals. The evacuation procedures for them have not yet been agreed upon by the governments of the countries concerned, so the hope of evacuation will be delayed for a month or more. The exchange location for this American and Japanese exchange of nationals has been determined to be Lourenço Marques in Portuguese Mozambique, East Africa. It is reported that both sides will send representatives to handle the matter during the exchange. The American representative is a Swiss diplomat stationed in Japan, and the Japanese representative is the secretary of the Spanish Embassy in Washington.

### Eating Moderately: Emphasizing Quality Over Quantity; Fruits Rich in Nutrients, Rice Lacks Vitamins

Dr. Lee Te of the Lester Institute of Medical Research in this city has been studying food nutrition for over twenty-five years. With extensive knowledge and numerous publications, he recently discussed nutritional issues with a Western newspaper reporter, stating:

Eating Too Much is Useless

If someone consumes a variety of foods but still suffers health problems, what is the benefit of overeating? Whether a diet is adequate is not necessarily determined by the quantity of food. In fact, consuming large amounts of food without health benefits is worse than not eating at all. Adequate food means proper diet, and a proper diet emphasizes quality, not quantity.

During times of emergency, some foods inevitably become scarce. To compensate for the lack of food, mixed substitutes are sold in the market. These substitutes often contain very few vitamins and are full of useless substances, so be careful not to overeat them.

Some people eat to live, while others live to eat. The difference between the two is significant, especially during times of food scarcity. In times of emergency, when food is scarce, the appetite of those who insist on delicious and fresh food becomes a blade, stabbing their stomachs. However, some people do not care much about it.

Those who eat to live seek only the essential foods with nutritional value, while those who live for the sake of eating are at a loss. In reality, merely eating is not enough; our diet must be appropriate.

Some people go to great lengths to get the most benefit from their diet, yet their diet is very simple. The secret to maintaining good health, like any secret, lies in moderation.

Most people buy food simply to fill their stomachs, without considering whether these foods contain vitamins. To achieve longevity, this trend must be eliminated. When we eat, we should remember that food must have the necessary side effects to maintain health. If we neglect this point, we will inevitably fall ill. Mild cases result in physical weakness, while severe cases lead to serious diseases.

Essential Elements for Health: Fruits and vegetables are important sources of vitamins and should be eaten more often. Overall, vegetables contain many important minerals: calcium, phosphorus, and iron. Although fruits do not contain much protein, they have sufficient mineral content and are also an important source of energy.

Fruits contain organic acids and volatile components, making them sweeter and providing ample amounts of vitamins and minerals, making them ideal for consumption after meals. People often regard fruits as thirst quenchers or as a way to pass the time, but eating some fruits after a meal can actually stimulate the appetite.

Other foods, such as cabbage, mustard greens, beets, sweet potatoes, and various beans, if eaten in large quantities, provide the body with all the necessary vitamins to maintain health.

The American and British Residents Association of Shanghai recently commissioned him to conduct a survey, which found that the nutritional content of food available to American residents in Shanghai is still quite adequate. The daily food cost for American residents is only about four yuan, which is manageable on a collective cooking basis. The amount of food for American residents may not fill their stomachs, but it is enough to maintain their health. This is the key to diet.

The Chinese people should also adopt foods that emphasize quality over quantity. They consume large amounts of rice and pay no attention to vitamins, which has become a habit. Because rice lacks vitamins, beriberi is prevalent in China. (Min)

### Public Bond Buying Reaches a Fever Pitch, Large Investors Emerge, Buyers Show No Hesitation

The over-the-counter market for public bonds was extremely lively yesterday, a rare sight in recent days. The counter price was most disturbed. Type A bonds were trading at 34 yuan, Type B at 31 yuan, and Types C and E also at 31 yuan. The market sentiment was high, unprecedented. However, as sellers emerged, the market price soon fell. Nevertheless, buyers rushed in, fearing that sellers would not sell, so even though large investors were emerging, buyers did not consider it too much. The enthusiasm for buying was unparalleled. Companies like Lianhe and Daqiantai absorbed over one hundred thousand, and Tongshen and Qianyi also had strong appetites. In addition, various firms such as Xinhua, Yu Ji, Dazhong, Tongkang, Zhenhe, Qingan, Dali, Hongxing, Runde, and Runli were also actively buying.

### Gold Sees High Prices Again, Tianjin Gang Sells Then Rebounds

The over-the-counter market for cash gold rose and then rebounded sharply, reaching an unprecedented high of 22,100 yuan. Due to the large-scale absorption by wealthy individuals earlier, the Tianjin gang sold off afterward, stabilizing the upward sentiment.

### Piece Goods Decline

Factory Cloth: Yesterday, the cloth market declined due to tight credit and increased selling pressure. The decline was also severe. However, large investors remained calm and absorbed at low prices. 16-pound Globe Coarse Cloth was at 100 yuan, and Flying Goose was at 195 yuan, down 10 yuan per piece. 12-pound Globe Fine Cloth was at 175 yuan, Dapeng was at 167.5 yuan, and Fugui was at 163 yuan, down 17-18 yuan per piece.

Eastern Cloth: Yesterday, the market sentiment was weak, and all markets continued to decline. 12-pound Longtou Fine Cloth new singles opened in the morning at 129 yuan, gradually declining (full two) to 112 yuan at noon, down 16 yuan per piece. Bank singles were at 180 yuan, Rainbow Ball Fine Cloth was at 188 yuan, Flying Fish was at 178 yuan, and Yanghe was at 175 yuan. Siji Serge red singles were at 8.25 yuan, opening at a high of 2.89 yuan, then declining in a straight line to 7.55 yuan at noon, down a significant 7 jiao per yard.

### Woolen Fabrics Increase Significantly

The sales of woolen fabrics were quite lackluster. The Western clothing business was slow, and the women's clothing business and new and old clothing shops had limited sales. The speculative business had long ceased, and retail sales were scarce. 客幫 were not interested. However, prices remained high throughout. Retail prices have been secretly increasing significantly recently after changing to new currency at 30%. It is estimated that they will rise to the level of the old legal tender to maintain assets.

### Wheat Bran Sales Still Good

Soybean transactions were mostly small, and the market trend was mostly bullish. Yesterday, 40 packages of Chongming Sand Red were sold at a price of 148 yuan per head of new legal currency, self-collected, and 150 yuan delivered. 30 packages of Pinghu Black Beans were priced at 150 yuan per head of new legal currency, self-collected.

The corn market presented a trend of first rising and then leveling off yesterday. Approximately 300 packages of Wuhu corn were traded, priced at 193 yuan to 191 yuan in old legal tender.

Actual sales of soybean cake were not very active, but the owners' intentions to sell were quite firm, and prices saw a slight increase. 500 pieces of Kai Zi soybean cake, February warehouse receipts, were priced at 43.5 yuan, and 500 pieces of May warehouse receipts were priced at 40 yuan. 1,000 pieces of Sheng Ji cake, April warehouse receipts, were priced at 45.5 yuan, and 500 pieces of May warehouse receipts were priced at 45.5 yuan, and 1,000 pieces of June warehouse receipts were priced at 45.5 yuan to 46 yuan. 500 pieces of February warehouse receipts were priced at 45 yuan, all calculated in new legal tender.

Wheat bran hoarding and sales were still good yesterday, and the market showed a bright outlook. 500 small packages of San Xin wheat bran, March 10 warehouse receipts, were priced at 70 yuan, May 10 warehouse receipts at 75 yuan, and end of May warehouse receipts at 78 yuan, all in new legal tender.

### Unified Dried Dates Already Being Sold

The previous market for black dates seemed quite quiet, as the change between new and old currencies led to unwillingness to sell. Recently, there is already a fixed rate (i.e., 2 to 1 as the standard), so unified goods on the market are now being sold. The price is 220 yuan in new currency for the best quality and 200 yuan for the next best quality. There is no shortage of buyers, and the trend is improving.

### Silver Bupleurum Price is Not Cheap

Bupleurum is one of the herbal medicines, but because the stock is not thick, the price is also quite high. The current market price of silver bupleurum in old currency has also reached more than 1,000 yuan, and the trend is firm.

### Hardware Sold in Reserve Certificates

Yesterday's hardware market, although lacking in transactions, saw increased interest, and the market atmosphere showed a slight turnaround. The Iron Industry Association has already resolved to sell all hardware products in Reserve Certificates, causing the market price of various goods to rise invisibly by 20-30% compared to the past. The following is a record of the market conditions for the main items (unit: Reserve Certificates).

### The Harm of Opium

— Cai Bao

The harm of opium is known to all, including women and children. Although proper and moderate use can serve as an anesthetic, the harm is unimaginable if it is treated as an addiction.

The older brother of a friend of mine, only in his thirties, in the prime of his youth and promising future, unfortunately became addicted to opium. He became thin and emaciated, and his spirit was withered. Every time he took a job, he was met with contempt from his superiors, leading to long-term unemployment. In addition, the addiction made him suffer and steal to survive. In the end, his family could not bear it and drove him out of the house, and his whereabouts are unknown. If a young man embarks on the path of opium smoking, his downfall is truly "as easy as turning one's hand."

Similarly, it is also the same in terms of thought. If a person goes astray, embarks on a distorted path, and his brain cells are contaminated with toxins, his downfall is as easy as drug addiction. Young people, be careful!

### My Great-Grandfather Lin Zexu

— Wuren

When I was a child, I always loved to listen to the old people tell interesting stories. Children's memory is stronger, longer, and simpler.

Regarding my great-grandfather, let me tell you a story that I heard before. Although it is a story, it is actually very simple. I only remember the beginning of this story. Wen Zhong had already been attacked by officials who were willing to compromise with foreign powers and sought only their own interests, because of his determination to handle the opium ban and foreign affairs. At that time, the weak-willed government, under the threat of internal traitors and foreign enemies, revealed its most timid attitude and exiled him to Yili, which was far away in Xinjiang. This exile naturally held little hope of returning alive. It is said that at that time, Grand Scholar Wang Ding committed suicide in protest of Lin Gong's protection. However, it could not reverse the Qing court's decree. Wen Zhong had three sons who all requested to accompany him to serve him, but Wen Zhong sternly rejected their requests. When he set off for exile, he composed a poem to show to his family. In it, there was the line: "If it is beneficial to the country, I will risk my life, how dare I avoid it for fortune and avoid disaster!" This firm attitude and his spirit of sacrificing for the nation truly shamed many shameless officials who sought their own glory.

My story is finished. Isn't it very simple? Today, thinking about the opium ban, it truly makes people infinitely silent.

Who would have thought that after a hundred years of the opium ban, all the situations would coincide with Wen Zhong's arguments. He said:

"The scourge of opium in the interior is like a boil poisoning the heart. When a boil grows, it gradually becomes pus, and when opium comes, it gradually leads to寇 (bandits/invasion), which was originally an expected thing..."

The more difficult the times are, the more people are reminded of the indomitable spirit of this national hero. He did not sigh at the dark clouds in the vast sky, or place his hopes in the boundless sea of night. He looked at the great road of life ahead, shouldered a heavy burden, and led the people on a path of light.

Many people, in order to cherish their own lives, lost their freedom to advance and retreat, and completely became skeptics. Twilight painted over the realm of their thoughts. Weren't most officials like this at that time?

Now, revisiting the story I heard as a child, I feel it is even more meaningful. This story has many lessons that can encourage, excite, and alert. Whether under the lamp or by the stove fire... I will always remember the voice and appearance of my father telling us this story. I also have great respect for my great-grandfather more than a hundred years ago, the figure in this story.

### Sand Pagoda

— Lu Chen

The third-rate person puts up an umbrella before it rains. The second-rate person puts up an umbrella after it rains. Only the first-rate person doesn't put up an umbrella even when it's raining. The first-rate person has a plan in mind before things happen. The second-rate person takes temporary measures after things happen. Those who remain ignorant even after things happen are ranked as third-rate people. So it is with natural disasters, and so it is with human affairs.

Instead of using three parts "courtesy" to those of higher rank, it is better to turn it into one part sincerity to those of lower rank. Instead of sympathizing with a weak person who is being bullied, it is better to make them understand the reason for being bullied.

Contentment is an obstacle to all progress. Any great man is produced by overcoming this obstacle, but he is only for the masses, not for himself.

Life has nothing to compare it to. Simply put, life is life. Life does not allow anyone to escape responsibility. Those who do not guard their own posts are said to be bringing disaster upon themselves and deserve to die.

People who progress are afraid of dying tomorrow, so they cherish today's time and do not waste a minute. People who fall are also afraid of dying tomorrow, so they try to spend today's time in an environment where they forget themselves.

### The College Student Selling Books

— Xiaohua

Nowadays, one often encounters unexpected things on the road. One afternoon, I ran into a classmate from my second year of college guarding a used book stall. In addition to a few novels and old magazines, there were Economics, World History, College Composition, and some textbooks used in college. Fate is truly a terrible mocker. Now it is mocking a person who was once called the "darling of heaven."

If there is such a day, a young person who is just entering college, picks up a book on Economics or something from the stall, what kind of mood will our stall owner sell it to him with? And what kind of fate is behind this college student! Our stall owner could not have predicted that, I mean, when he bought these books designated by the professors for something ridiculous called credits, they would one day become his means of earning a living?

I sat down at the stall. I was sitting on a box that our stall owner used to hold books. He said that British political propagandists stood on it to speak, while another kind of hero in our Shanghai滩 stored them in warehouses, attics, and under beds, naturally filled with something called soap. Maybe they would laugh at our stall owner's stupidity, saying why read books, why go to college? If they had exchanged these boxes of books for soap earlier, wouldn't they have been able to make a fortune?

We talked about the changes in personnel and the difficulty of life, but his business came. So we said goodbye. I made an appointment with him to bring some books in a couple of days.

On the way back, my thoughts were very complex. I don't despise selling books; occupations are originally neither noble nor lowly. The only thing that is sad is that a person has read books for several years, and in the end, he can only rely on selling these books to make a living. Maybe he can't blame others, but can he blame himself? Wise sir, what do you say he can do? Seizing by force and gaining wealth through manipulation, he can become a giant in a short time, but it is not easy to earn money by relying on knowledge and skills. The path to life is originally narrow for these people. If we don't float our eyes on the surface of things but can see deeper, we should have some understanding.

This column has added a "Chatterbox" section, and readers from all walks of life are welcome to speak. The first speaker is Dr. Yu Xin, editor of the Chinese Health Association magazine and director of the Public Health Division of the Engineering Bureau Industrial Section. The full text will be published in four installments, so please pay attention to it.

### Doctor and Patient

— Yu Xin Si

(1) The Erroneous Path of Medical Treatment

There shouldn't seem to be any barriers between patients and doctors and nurses. Seeking medical treatment when sick is a very natural and focused endeavor, as natural as asking a technician to repair a broken machine. However, the former is more complex, as it involves a relationship between people, inevitably leading to emotions, psychology, technical skills, social aspects, and economic considerations. Therefore, it seems difficult to achieve a situation where there are absolutely no disagreements between the two parties.

To achieve this rare and valuable ideal, some doctors, when performing their duties, prioritize expediency over thoroughness. For example, when encountering a patient with a fever, instead of seeking the source of the illness or making an accurate diagnosis, they immediately prescribe medication to reduce the fever. This "treat the head when the head aches" approach is still favored by many patients. In fact, this method of treatment is the simplest, caters to the patient's psychology, and is supported by the patient's family because it produces immediate results. As a result, everyone abandons the path of scientific investigation and embarks on an erroneous path.

If embarking on an erroneous path immediately leads to harm or has obvious consequences, this method would soon be naturally eliminated. However, things are not so simple in the world. The harm caused by being on the wrong path is often not attributed to itself but is instead blamed on irrelevant factors.

In hospitals, there are such situations. A patient may have severe abdominal pain before coming to the hospital, but when examined, the pain is no longer present. This makes diagnosis difficult, and one can only observe the situation temporarily. Who knew that the patient had secretly taken opium to relieve the pain before coming to the hospital, which obscured the symptoms during the examination. This completely masked the signs of acute appendicitis, resulting in delayed treatment, leading to a ruptured appendix and peritonitis, endangering life. But who would consider the act of taking opium for pain relief to be inappropriate?

In contrast to inappropriately assigning blame, there is also inappropriately assigning credit. Some diseases must follow a specific course to recover, and there is no shortcut. Typhoid fever is an example; the illness will last for several weeks. Patients always hope to be completely cured within three to five days, resulting in consulting numerous doctors. In the end, all the credit goes to the last doctor. The appropriate care given earlier is dismissed as insignificant, but the final prescription, whatever it may be, will be hailed as a great achievement.

Due to the improper attribution of blame and credit, patients and doctors become lost on the wrong path. Patients, regardless of their illness, consider injections as the ultimate solution. As a result, various injectable medicines flood the market, and even small rooms become pharmaceutical workshops. Originally, medicine was just a tool for treating diseases, but the complexity of the human body is like the complexity of human affairs. Therefore, relying solely on medication while neglecting to promote the body's natural resistance will be a major flaw in treatment.

### Treat the Head When the Head Aches

— Da Fen

"Headache is just a symptom, and the problem isn't necessarily in the head, but most people just 'treat the head when the head aches.' The result of indiscriminately taking over-the-counter medications often makes the situation worse!" said Dr. Mike. The body's many important organs do not respond well to excessive burdens, and too much burden often causes pain. To announce this abnormal disturbance, they complain to the head, which is the central nervous system. Thus, the head becomes the target of everyone's complaints and experiences frequent pain.

Occasional headaches are not critical, but periodic headaches are a dangerous warning sign. According to expert research and analysis, there are as many as 203 causes of headaches.

Some over-the-counter headache medications on the market are harmless, meaning they neither cure anything nor harm the body, but some are very dangerous. Therefore, one should consult a doctor or rest when experiencing a headache, and avoid indiscriminately taking over-the-counter medications.

According to Dr. Lake-Kelly's research, headaches can be divided into three main categories: mechanical headaches, caused by diseases and injuries to the head, including astigmatism, eye strain, and colds. Toxic headaches can be caused by toxins from outside the body, such as alcohol, gas, tobacco, etc., or by toxins produced within the body. Psychological functional headaches have no identifiable organic causes.

### Mobile Brick House

— Yong Yun

When Americans travel, they often stay in mobile homes towed behind their cars for economic reasons, rather than staying in hotels. After several improvements, the exterior of this type of house now resembles a brick bungalow, with four wheels underneath and steps for entering and exiting. The interior is fully equipped with showers, electric lights, and other conveniences.

### Sharing the Same Boat

— He Jia Zhi

(5) Reciprocity

Guofang intended to board the boat immediately; Weicheng wanted her to have lunch before boarding. Cuizhen suggested a compromise: to leave after breakfast. Guoqi arrived and asked Zhang Shurong, "If we set sail at this time, when can we reach Shanghai?" Zhang Shurong laughed. "We row for Master Chen very quickly; whenever Master Chen wants to reach Shanghai, that's when we'll arrive." Weicheng said, "Zhang Shurong, don't be so sure." Madam Ye the Second also arrived. Hearing them discuss leaving after breakfast, she overturned their plan, saying, "That's impossible. No guest who comes to our house leaves without having lunch. Miss Chen, don't break our rules." "Madam Ye the Second" said. Guoqi and his sister felt that Madam Ye the Second's hospitality was difficult to refuse and couldn't reject her. Between breakfast and lunch, Cuizhen used the time to pack. After lunch, after washing her face, Guoqi said, "We are very grateful for our Second Aunt's kindness. Now we can go to the boat." Madam Ye the Second and Weicheng knew that Guoqi was exceptionally straightforward, so they didn't try to persuade them to stay. The whole family, from Madam Ye the Second to Magpie, all escorted them to the riverside to watch Guoqi, his sister Guofang, and Cuizhen board the boat. Madam Ye the Second instructed Zhang Shurong at the riverside, "Row the boat steadily; don't just focus on speed. Don't row it unsteadily." Zhang Shurong readily agreed. Standing at the bow of the boat, he touched the bottom of the river lightly with a bamboo pole, and the boat changed direction. The crew members took their positions at the helm and oars. Guofang leaned out of the boat window, waving a white silk scarf. Weicheng smiled, nodded, and waved his hand. Madam Ye the Second said, "It's cold outside; go inside, Weicheng." Weicheng followed her inside. Madam Ye the Second said, "That Miss Chen was so lively; once she leaves, we will immediately feel calm." Weicheng said, "The worst thing is that they took Sister Cuizhen away too. Sister Cuizhen rarely goes to other people's houses, but she was persuaded by Guofang. It's clear that Guofang has considerable charm. Oh, what clothes did Sister Cuizhen wear when she left? It doesn't seem to be a blue cloth robe?" (93)
