### Kamata's Remarks

The Shanghai correspondent of the Domei News Agency reported that Colonel Kamata, director of the press department of the Japanese fleet in China, made a statement yesterday, expressing his hope that the visit of the Japanese goodwill mission to China would strengthen cooperation between Japan and China so that the current war can be brought to a satisfactory end. It is said that when Japan controls the Pacific and Indian Oceans and accelerates the development of resources in the southern region, the visit of Special Envoys Hiranuma, Arita, and Nagai to China will make a significant contribution to further cooperation between the two countries. Japan's selection of these three special envoys who are familiar with Chinese affairs is enough to show its sincerity and trust in the Nanjing government.

### Fireworks Fill Stalingrad as Germans Tighten Encirclement From Both Sides Heavy Snow Falls in the Grozny Region

Moscow, 22nd (Domei News Agency)

German forces are tightening their encirclement of Stalingrad from the northwest to the southwest. The city, which stretches 35 miles along the banks of the Volga River, has now become the entire front line. Transport routes and suburbs are filled with fireworks. Soviet troops have launched fierce counterattacks and opened barrages from the east bank of the Volga River to stop the German advance. The intensity of the artillery fire is unprecedented since the beginning of the war. The German army has also brought in siege artillery to retaliate. The artillery battles between the two sides continue day and night.

Stockholm, Sweden, 22nd (Havas)

Today marks the sixteenth month of the German-Soviet war. The focus of the war remains on the Stalingrad front. According to German claims, Soviet convoys launched a strong offensive on Sunday, but were repelled by German forces. The battle is most intense in the northwest. For four days and four nights, the two armies have been advancing and retreating, remaining in a stalemate. From a global perspective, the battle for the city seems to have become a positional war. However, it is generally believed that the German army will regroup in order to launch a decisive offensive.

Somewhere on the Ukrainian border, 22nd (Havas)

The battle on the Stalingrad front has greatly eased due to the harsh climate and the fierce resistance of the Red Army. Heavy snow falls in the Grozny region, making the situation even more difficult. On the eastern section of the Caucasus front, German forces occupied the two cities of Tailek and Vladikavkaz ten days ago, but only announced it yesterday. On the western section, the joint German-Romanian forces, after receiving reinforcements, resumed their advance along the Black Sea coast towards the port of Tuapse. A major battle is brewing in the Kalmyk region, with Astrakhan as the main target. It is reported that the German side has concentrated a large army in Vernocchi and Elista. In the Dubovka region, in the area of Taganrog, the Red Army broke through a deep and long gap in the German lines on the 20th of this month, but it has been restored to its original state by the German army.

Istanbul, 22nd (Haitong News Agency)

It was learned here today that General Timoshenko is now on the front lines in Stalingrad, personally commanding the battle. He has repeatedly transferred reserve troops to launch counterattacks. The German army is using tanks and infantry to advance in a fan shape towards the city. The Soviet defenders have suffered heavy casualties, and they are even unable to bury the dead. The corpses and the wounded are also unattended. The scorched air after the houses are burned and the stench of corpses fill the air, and there are fears of an epidemic. The German air force is still very active in destroying the enemy's resistance.

### Germans Announce Occupation of the City of Bolshaya Izhora

German Headquarters, 22nd (Haitong News Agency)

This afternoon's German war report stated that on the previous night, Soviet forces attempted to transport troops by speedboat and destroyer to land northwest of Novorossiysk. German aircraft bombed the enemy's positions in Gelendzhik and ships in the port of Tuapse. German forces active between the Sea of Azov and the city of Kuban broke through the heavily defended and densely mined enemy defenses and captured the city of Bolshaya Izhora. Our army fiercely attacked the enemy entrenched in the large houses in the city of Stalingrad, fighting hand-to-hand in the streets, capturing many enemies and seizing several large houses. The Soviet reinforcements north of the city were defeated, losing 21 tanks. German daredevils along the Don River crossed the river and destroyed 35 strong enemy fortresses on the east bank. Hungarian forces repelled the invading enemy. Yesterday, Soviet forces did not attack Voronezh. The enemy northwest of the city has been defeated. The enemy near Erzif again attacked with strong forces, some being blocked and others being counterattacked and repelled. 28 enemy tanks were destroyed.

### US-Finnish Relations To Have New Developments Finnish Minister to the US Indicates Willingness to Make Peace Hull Claims He Will Issue a Statement

Lisbon, 22nd (Domei News Agency)

US Secretary of State Hull told reporters yesterday that he would soon issue a statement explaining the relationship between the United States and Finland. When asked if Finnish Minister to the US Procope had indicated that the country could appear as soon as it had permanent security, Hull replied that he was not yet ready to express an opinion, but was studying the situation from all sides. In November of last year, the US State Department notified Procope that the Soviet Union was ready to purchase peace separately with Finland, and he was still waiting for the Finnish government to take advantage of this opportunity.

Washington, 21st (Havas)

A recent statement issued by the Finnish Legation in the United States stated that Finland would withdraw from the current war as soon as the threat to its survival was eliminated and its security was permanently guaranteed. All circles here are paying close attention to this. However, Secretary of State Hull told reporters today that he was not in a position to make any statement on the current relationship between the United States and Finland. As for the rumor that Finnish troops have been inactive for months and have recently launched an offensive on the northern route of the Eastern Front, he had nothing to say. Political figures unanimously believe that the above statement by the Finnish Legation is an attempt to win sympathy from the American public. It is said that in the past, all circles in the United States had expressed sympathy for Finland. Among the European countries, Finland was the only country that had repaid all of its war debts. Even after the outbreak of the first Soviet-Finnish war, the heroic resistance of the Finnish army had impressed Americans. However, in this second Soviet-Finnish war, the Finnish army is fighting alongside the German army, and the interests of the United States and Finland have therefore clashed. A few months ago, the State Department even asked the Finnish government to close its consulates in the United States. It can be seen that the relations between the two countries are becoming increasingly tense. However, because the two countries have not severed diplomatic relations, no decisive action has been taken. However, it is generally believed that the current situation may lead to new developments.

### Negotiations on Martinique Island Underway

Lisbon, 22nd (Haitong News Agency)

Washington - The US State Department's intelligence conference yesterday discussed again the relationship between the United States and Finland and the negotiations between the United States and the French authorities on Martinique Island. Secretary of State Hull refused to answer questions about US-Finnish relations, but said that there was nothing to report at the moment, but hoped to have something to publish in the future. Regarding the negotiations between the United States and the Martinique authorities, Hull said that the talks were proceeding smoothly, but some economic issues were more difficult, so their resolution would take some time. Regarding the question of Argentine Admiral Stewart's trip to Washington, Hull said that Stewart hoped to discuss shipping issues between the United States and Argentina with US officials.

At the time, Liu believed it to be true and went with the detectives. During the trip, the detectives took Liu to the French Park and demanded a reward of 100,000 yuan to settle the matter.

The detectives were angered by Chen Liechang and planned to arrest him, but failed. Chen then hired French lawyer Tang Yulaimai to surrender, and hired lawyer Chen Maoxuan to provide legal assistance. The detectives have now been arrested and are under investigation.

### Records of the Five Religions Society's Scripture Lectures

In the 62nd session of the Five Religions Scripture Lecture Society, Master Chuantong spoke on the essence of religion. After the lecture, he raised several questions to the members. One of them was: "The five religions can never be merged. If they are merged into one, it will become a sixth religion. Was there no reason why the Great Achievement Religion failed to achieve its goals in the past?" At that time, no one answered. Mr. Shen Jueling, whose hearing was rather poor, did not hear it. Later, someone told Mr. Shen this idea. Mr. Shen smiled and said, "The meaning of merging the five is not to merge the five religions into one. Confucius taught people without discrimination. Extending this meaning, the five religions will complement each other, and the world will truly achieve great harmony. There will be no mutual attacks or mutual criticisms. It does not seek quick success. Confucius once taught Zixia that mothers want things to be quick, and the same is true for everything, let alone such a big problem?"

Our client, Qian Qitai, previously co-owned the Huatong Copy Paper Factory with Wu Nonghua and Cao Xinding. The business ceased operations shortly after its establishment. Recently, due to Wu Nonghua's failure to pay his share of the capital, a lawsuit arose between the two parties. Wu accused Qian Qitai of embezzlement, while Qian counter-sued Wu Nonghua for false accusations and embezzlement of funds. During the court hearing on the 8th of this month, the court clearly recognized that the dispute was entirely a civil matter and ordered a suspension of the criminal trial pending the outcome of the civil lawsuit. The defendant was temporarily released on bail, subject to being available for summons. Therefore, the criminal part of the case has been suspended pending the resolution of the civil case, and there are no grounds for the assertion that the defendant faces serious charges and is on bail awaiting trial. We are deeply concerned that this may cause confusion and hereby request that your newspaper publish a correction in the correction column to clarify the matter. Sincerely, Attorney Li Fengshen on behalf of Qian Qitai.

Yesterday's newspaper was published at 6:40 PM.

### Bond Market Weary at Festival Time

Due to the Mid-Autumn Festival, over-the-counter trading of public bonds saw some selling pressure for settlement purposes, leading to a continued weakening of market prices and quiet sentiment. Trading volume was reduced, and there was no formal indication of market concentration. This is expected to wait until after the festival. Minor offloading by Tongsheng, Tongli, and Xinji caused market prices to decline slightly. Buyers were scattered and disorganized, making the market feel idle. Most bonds continued to decline by small fractions to one yuan. Type C bonds traded at a high price of five yuan and a small price of three yuan eight jiao, with the final transaction around four yuan or more, and limited volume. However, there are some bond enthusiasts who seem to have an interest in the six beauties vividly depicted on the bond certificates.

East cloth continued to rise, with 12-pound Longtou fine cloth from the New New single rising another five jiao to 178.5 yuan.

### The Woolen and Broadcloth Market is Strong

The broadcloth market was quite active yesterday, and various goods trended upward. This was due to the busy activity of the Nanjing group last week, coupled with the recent surge in retail sales at Western clothing tailoring shops. As a result, sentiment was revived and various goods saw opening deals, with overcoats and fine woolen broadcloth especially strong. Demand from the local group for Daming rainproof serge and Meilun riding serge was not weak. There was continued buying interest in lining soft linings, mercerized feather yarns, crepe satin, floral foreign cloths, horse mane sleeve linings, and other items, with female-colored overcoats and women's wear stores in the 160-170 yuan range seeing substantial demand.

### Supply of Raw Soybean Oil Increasing

There are also 5,500 barrels of Dalian oil being shipped to Shanghai.

### Orchid Seeds Offered Fresh

New orchid seeds have been arriving in production areas for many days, and the first batch of dozens of pieces arrived on the previous day. The color and texture are good. Maybe you can see more today. The beginning is about one-third higher than the old goods. The main reason is the increase in foreign expenses.

### Tangerine Peel Cake Arrived Sparsely, Looking Up

Dozens of barrels of tangerine peel cakes arrived earlier and have already been sold through. Customers continue to load twenty or thirty days, but due to crowded seats, only ten pieces have been loaded. It was reported that the city had arrived yesterday. The inventory is empty, and foreign expenses and water feet are high, so the continuation is up. Approximately, the market can be opened on Friday and Saturday of this week.

### The Factory Announced Delivery, and the British and American Tobacco Market Softened

Yesterday, the British and American tobacco market softened after the factory announced delivery of cigarettes. The Japanese tobacco market remained strong due to the continued delivery of goods.

### Queen's Opening: Watching Mei Lanfang's Performance and Bidding Farewell to Mei's Beard

— Su Shaoqing

Old-style theater doesn't need a curtain at all, only a broken stage ritual. The opening ceremony exists because Shanghai imitated the Western-style stage. The first stage for opening was the New Stage of the Sixteenth Shop. The first time I visited the stage opening was at the New Great World Stage. At that time, the person in charge was Mr. Li Zhengwu of Siming. I don’t remember who cut the ribbon. Xun Huisheng was the person who lifted the curtain, and the speakers were the guests Yan Duhe and the insignificant me. I also watched the opening of the stage renovation the year before last. The ribbon cutters were all four kun (female) actors. They all wore red cheongsams, wore red flowers, and cut colorful ribbons. The ceremony was grand and the colors were quite rich. A few days ago, the Queen's Cinema was changed to perform Peking Opera, and an opening ceremony was held. Kun Dan Wang Yulao guaranteed the ribbon cutting, and Huang Jinrong, Yuan Ludeng, Mei Lanfang and others unveiled the curtain. I was invited to participate. There were various rumors about Lanfang before, but now he has returned to Shanghai safely. There were an unusually large number of guests that day, most of whom came to see Mei's original face. Whether he had a beard or not was the focus of everyone's attention. Even I personally was very concerned about Mei's plumpness or thinness. At ten minutes before six o'clock, it was suddenly reported that Mei had arrived, and the crowd rushed into their seats, causing chaos. Chairs were set up on the stage, and the executives took their seats. Lanfang sat in the center, with Huang on the left and Yuan on the right, just like the ranking posted in the newspaper. There were many other people sitting with them, so I won't mention them. At this time, everyone waited quietly for the photo. A friend gave me binoculars so I could take a closer look at the expressions of Mei, Huang, and Yuan. Mr. Mei did not look thin or old, but he had a short mustache. Probably because he used to pluck them often, the hairs were sparse and cut very short. If it weren't for the binoculars, it wouldn't be visible from a distance. Huang on the left and Yuan on the right are both old and have no beards. The three people sitting together complemented each other. That day, Mei was dressed in a Western-style suit and leather shoes, while Huang and Yuan were dressed in long-sleeved robes and held folding fans, which also formed an intricate pattern. (On Mr. Huang's left, Wang Yurong was also wearing a white dress with black flowers, which was also very distinctive.) Mr. Mei had a smile on his face and looked very happy. The difficulties in Hong Kong were half a year ago, so I guess he doesn't have any impressions anymore. I am happy for him out of friendship. I won't repeat the ribbon cutting, unveiling, and other matters. I think Mr. Lanfang's demeanor is enough for him to return to the stage and make a splash. Some say that he has already grown a beard, so what can he do? I said, what's the harm? In the past, Lao Shiyidan retired from acting in his later years and grew a long beard. Later, in order to perform a charity show, he resolutely shaved his beard. There is a precedent for repeatedly growing and shaving it more than once or twice. The beard is something that people want to live or don't grow for many months. If people want to get rid of it, they can get rid of it in one go. If Lanfang is willing to sacrifice for a charity show, he will definitely be willing to say goodbye to his beard temporarily. Now I write a song to send off Mei's beard: Mei's beard, I tell you, you must listen. You must sacrifice yourself for righteous plays, or meet a powerful person to send you off. The farewell wine is set up in the long pavilion ten miles away. You have no fate to be close to Mei Lang's lips. You should quickly plan your return and don't nag.

### Tianchan has New Performers Chen Dahe and Li Yunqiu

— Plum Blossom Pavilion Master

Chen Dahe, a new actor on the Tianchan stage, came from the ranks of amateur performers and inherited the essence of the Du Yan school to his clean and firm purpose. A few days ago, I listened to a section of the Erjin Palace at the Lishe Ticket Office. It was clear and melodious, and it did have the flavor of Xiao Yu. Da He's voice is as wide and bright as Cheng Junmou's, and it is sweeter than him. He can perform many plays, such as "Visiting Mother", "Catching and Releasing Cao", "Beaded Curtain Village", "Black Basin", "Empty City Stratagem", "Dingjun Mountain", and "Touching the Stele". All of these have been pointed out by famous masters, especially the masterpieces. It is heard that Da He's performance at Tianchan this time is a trial. If successful, he will go forward bravely and implement the move to the sea. If he fails, he will need to sharpen himself and then study further. Success or failure is not taken into account. If Da He is like this, he is worthy of being a loyal believer in the old drama world. Also, the court's Dan actor, Li Yunqiu, has an extremely beautiful appearance and a wonderful voice. Her body is slender and graceful, and her makeup and posture are excellent. Yesterday, I was visited and tried to sing a section of "Relieving the Solution". Her technique of voice and tune is comparable to the Xue Yanqin and Lu Sujuan of that year. Although she is a newcomer, she is also worthy of being mentioned by a humble pen.

### Hong Moying's Son is About to Get Engaged

— Ying

Director Hong Mo graduated from Jinan University and stayed at the school as a teaching assistant in the Department of Physics. However, he had a great love for stage art, so he soon changed careers and engaged in theatrical work. Dramas such as "One Turn Phoenix and Ming" and "Dumb Wife" were all directed by him. Recently, the red star Hong Jixing has been shining brightly, and he has a deep relationship with the drama actor Yingzi. It is heard that the engagement ceremony will be held in the middle of next month.

### Sharing the Same Boat in the Storm

— He Jia Zhi

(9) Hell on Earth

Here, Wei Yunqing is kneeling to Asi, but there, Wei Shaoyun is kneeling to Cuizhen. Cuizhen was imprisoned in Wei Yunqing's house for four or five days. Wei Yunqing came to Cuizhen with two faces every day. First, he came in with a smile, and then he went out with an angry face. Cuizhen made up her mind. Whether you smile or get angry, I won't talk to her. Wei Shaoyun found out about this, and he gathered his gang at dawn and rescued Cuizhen from Longtan Tiger's Den, but immediately sent her to another Longtan Tiger's Den. Mrs. Wei, Jiu Ding, knew about it, and the servants of the Wei family also knew about it. Only because Wei Yunqing and Wei Shaoyun are compared, although it is violence instead of violence, Wei Shaoyun is still trustworthy in terms of money, so they all protect Wei Shaoyun and let Wei Yunqing threaten and entice them, they will always say they don't know.

On this day, Cuizhen arrived at the home of Wei Shaoyun's sister and brother-in-law. Wei Shaoyun's sister, A Ying, and brother-in-law, Sheng Hushan, had been notified by Wei Shaoyun the night before and had already understood what was going on. When they saw the future sister-in-law Jiu Ding arrive at home, they immediately gave up their room. Wei Shaoyun opened his mouth and Cuizhen's sister closed her mouth. Cuizhen's sister tried her best to shrug her shoulders and said with a smile, Cuizhen's sister, look how beautiful I am, compared to the old man with a beard in my house, I am in the sky and he is on the ground. Cuizhen's sister, marry me. I am Wei Yunqing's son, Shaoyun. Why am I his son? Not for anything else, just because he has some stinky money, but Cuizhen's sister must understand that the old man's money is stinky in his hands, and it immediately turns from stinky to fragrant in our hands. Cuizhen's sister, although there is a woman named after me in my house, she can leave immediately when you come, or we can be generous and let you be the big wife and let her be the concubine. If you want to wash your face, you can call her to pour water to wash your face. Wei Shaoyun said this sentence back and forth more than a dozen times. Cuizhen has only been submissive these days, and she doesn't know where to cry. She wants to laugh but forgets how to laugh. Let Wei Shaoyun say it aside, she just doesn't pay attention to it. When she really can't listen to it, she covers her ears and closes her eyelids, not caring about anything. (84)
