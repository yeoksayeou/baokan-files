London, 8th (Reuters) – Reuters correspondent Walker reported by telephone from Batavia that based on observations, the next major operation by the Japanese army appears to be a large-scale attack on Java, the center of Allied resistance in the southwestern Pacific region.

Among the banks of the Allied nations in this port that have opened safe deposit boxes, there are already three: Mercantile Bank, Chase Bank, and HSBC. Mercantile Bank's opening method for safe deposit boxes is to open thirty boxes each day. Registration is done in the morning, and items are retrieved from the boxes starting at 3:00 PM in the afternoon.

### The Purpose of Marriage

— Yi

Everyone has a different purpose for marriage. I think that a quote from Oscar Wilde, the author of "Lady Windermere's Fan," is worth studying.

He said: "Men marry because they are tired; women, because they are curious: both are disappointed."

Indeed, after men achieve some success in their careers, they hope to gain mental refreshment through marriage. However, after they marry, they find that they have even more responsibilities. As women grow older, they hope to start a new life through marriage, but they are also disappointed.

Marriage is, in essence, a responsibility. To make married life fulfilling, both parties must understand and help each other, and they should also engage in self-cultivation for the sake of the next generation.

Many people are still getting married during this period, and they should focus on spiritual aspects. Otherwise, in the absence of sufficient material conditions, dissatisfaction will often arise. To make married life fulfilling, acquiring knowledge about marriage is a prerequisite.

### Husband Opinion Survey

— Li Si Hua

Not long ago, a husband survey was conducted in St. Louis, USA. Although it was only held in that one place, the materials collected can represent the opinions of husbands in general.

The husbands surveyed had all been married for more than five years. The first question was, "What is the one thing that your wife does that you find most unsatisfactory?" Most of the husbands answered that their wives were too romantic. Some husbands said that their wives were too stubborn and liked to handle everything in the home in a dictatorial manner.

The second noteworthy question was, "What is the one thing that you find most satisfying about your wife?" None of the husbands participating in the survey listed their wife's beauty as the answer to this question. The most common answer was that their wives gave them companionship. The second most common answer was the wives' loyalty, and the third was their kind temperament. This third point included many aspects. Some husbands said, "His wife often laughs." Some husbands said, "His wife is as warm as the sun." Some husbands believed that their wives' self-controlled personalities complemented their gentle attitudes. Many husbands cited their wives' rich knowledge, patience, and skill in managing household finances as reasons why they were satisfied with their wives.

There was also a question: "What action of your wife satisfies you?" The answers to this question were overwhelming. We may as well select a few and list them below:

"No matter what time I come downstairs, breakfast is already prepared?"

"She is able to have a specific budget for the use of money."

"She never calls me during office hours."

"She often advises me to save money."

"She does not often invite friends over to play cards."

### Household Tips

— Hong

If oil stains accidentally get on clothes, there is no need to wash them. Just hang them in a well-ventilated place, and the oil will naturally evaporate and dissipate, and the smell will also disappear.

It is best to keep a few sprigs of fresh peppercorns in the cupboard where bowls, plates, and food are stored to repel mice. If you often put a few sprigs of camphor, you can repel cockroaches.

When grinding ink, if you use vinegar instead of water, the ink will be blacker and shinier. In winter, it is common to have problems with ink freezing. If you use alcohol instead of water, the effect is very good.

Remove the thin skin from both sides of fresh whole raw lard, cut it into two-inch squares, mix it with white sugar, and store it in a porcelain container. It can be stored for at least a winter.

Shoe polish inevitably becomes hard and difficult to use. If you add a little milk, it will become soft and moist.

If there is dirt accumulated on bowls and plates that cannot be removed after repeated wiping, you can re-wash them with salt and vinegar, and the result will definitely be satisfactory.

### One Week's Homestyle Menu

— Ms. Huaying

Pork was once so expensive that it cost more than five yuan per catty, making people feel like they hadn't tasted meat in three months. Recently, for some reason, it has become much cheaper, around three yuan per catty. In the past, my family often ate dishes like rapeseed stir-fried with shredded pork and celery stir-fried with shredded pork. One yuan's worth of meat couldn't be cut into much, and often only vegetables were visible, which was truly pitiful! But these days, we can actually eat whole pieces of meat. For example, stewed pork with Chinese cabbage is delicious, and the meat oil makes it extra rich. Another example is winter bamboo shoots and salted meat soup, where small pieces of salted meat, fresh meat, and winter bamboo shoots are stewed together. If you have salted Chinese cabbage at home, adding some of it will not only enhance the flavors of these four ingredients but also make the soup very tasty.

Monday: Stir-fried Ten-Delicacy Meat with Sauce, Small Yellow Croaker with Pickled Mustard Greens, Stir-fried Chinese Cabbage, Scallion Oil Radish Strips

Tuesday: Celery and Beef Strips, Stir-fried Fish Soup, Spinach with Tofu, Cold-Tossed Flowering Cabbage

Wednesday: Braised Pork Knuckles with Soybeans, Dried Shrimp Egg Drop Soup, Pickled Mustard Green and Broad Bean Paste, Sweet and Sour Spicy Cabbage

Thursday: Beef Stir-fried with Vermicelli, Braised Green Carp Slices, Stir-fried Cabbage, Vegetarian Tofu Soup

Friday: Braised Lamb Leg, Glass Noodles and White Fish Head, Vinegared Julienne Mustard Greens, Snowy Pea Sprouts

Saturday: Winter Bamboo Shoot Stewed with Salted and Fresh Meat, Scallion Roasted Small Fish, Braised Vegetarian Ten-Delicacy, Sesame Sauce Mixed with Celery

Sunday: Ten-Delicacy Hot Pot, Fried Ribbonfish, Stir-fried Greens, Stir-fried Radish
