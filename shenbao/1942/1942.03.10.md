Bennett Warns Against Repeating the Mistakes of Malaya

Sydney, 8th, Havas News Agency Dispatch: Major General Bennett, the former commander of Australian forces in Malaya, gave a broadcast speech here, discussing the issue of the Japanese invasion of Australia. He believes that Japan is most likely to attack the weakest point of Australia's continental defenses first. He said, "As far as I can see, the first step will be to attempt to occupy Broome, Wyndham, Darwin Port, and various air force bases in northern Queensland, and then advance inland along the airfields. We must prevent them from establishing a foothold in Australia and prevent them from launching attacks on our inland cities from the northern airfields. In short, we should not concentrate all our forces and all our residents in the southern regions."

Sydney, 9th, Reuters News Agency Dispatch: Major General Bennett, the former commander of Australian forces in the Malayan region, telegraphed from here yesterday that time is of the essence and the situation is critical. We cannot waste valuable time debating the merits and demerits of the two battles of Malaya and Singapore. The fundamental reason for the defeat in the Malayan campaign was "wishful thinking." Certain important officials wrongly assumed that the Japanese had no intention of attacking Malaya, so defenses were lax. They also believed that the Japanese would choose a convenient place to attack, so the "wishful thinking faction" attempted to defend Singapore on the ocean side. They also believed that the Japanese air force's strength was insufficient, but this was not the case. Australia cannot repeat this mistake and must quickly take all necessary steps to avoid becoming a continuation of Malaya.

It may even be delayed until the beginning of June, depending on when the ground dries out. According to normal conditions, drying takes three or four weeks, but because of the heavy snow this winter, there is too much water on the ground, which may take longer. However, the German army will still use sporadic battles to explore the most appropriate starting point for the spring offensive. This preliminary battle will use infantry and not motorized units or armored divisions.

Vichy, 8th, Havas News Agency Dispatch: A military observer here recently stated that the greatest feature of the German-Soviet war is that there are no fixed positions. The troops on both sides are intertwined and deeply complex in the battles in various regions. It is difficult to determine the positions of both sides. This situation of melee is most obvious in the Orel, Smolensk, Valda, and Leningrad urban areas. This also acknowledges at the German headquarters that the "resistance units" left by the German army in the enemy's positions will be in a very important position in the spring offensive. The Red Army, which recaptured 于克诺夫 city a few days ago, is now trying to contact the Red Army that recaptured 洛斯明诺 city (20 miles southeast of Vyazma city). As for the Kerch Peninsula, because the frozen ice in the strait has now begun to melt and become fragile, it is no longer possible to maintain normal traffic. The Red Army cannot obtain reinforcements from the Taman Peninsula, so all opportunities for the Red Army to recapture the Kerch area have been missed.

Since reducing the number of vehicles, the French Water and Electricity Company has recently observed an increasing number of people riding without paying, which has greatly affected revenue. It has ordered all its Chinese and foreign inspectors and ticket collectors to treat those who do not have a company pass and do not buy a ticket as freeloaders. Regardless of whether they are police officers, government employees, or officials from various agencies, they must purchase a ticket or be taken to the nearest police station and fined for purchasing a monthly ticket. This will take effect immediately in order to make up for the losses. In recent days, there have been several cases of people riding without paying and being taken to the police station.

### Amidst Food Controls: Current Milk Product Supply; Imported Milk Powder Difficult to Purchase; Domestic "An Jian Er" Substitutes

Fresh milk, canned milk, and milk powder are consumed in large quantities by middle- and upper-class families, restaurants, and hospitals in this city. Except for fresh milk, which is still supplied as usual, canned milk and milk powder are subject to price controls. While consumers benefit from the lower prices, purchasing them is quite inconvenient. The current supply situation of milk products in this city is summarized as follows:

Fresh Milk

Fresh milk is currently not affected by price controls and is supplied as usual. However, it is quite difficult for new customers to subscribe to Grade A milk, as the production of Grade A milk is limited and only sufficient to supply existing subscribers. Currently, there are only a dozen or so Grade A milk producers, such as Ziyou, Shengsheng, Kedi, Xuzhi, and Jieyuan. There are many more Grade B milk producers, numbering several dozen, scattered around western Shanghai. Due to the shortage of canned milk, the consumption of fresh milk is increasing daily.

Canned Milk. Imported brands of canned milk such as "Carnation" are difficult to purchase in the market after the sale was restricted. Some consumers, due to urgent needs, have sought help from others and managed to purchase a few cans at prices exceeding the controlled price. Some have even gone to the Hongkou district to purchase them. The French Concession Health Department has issued a notice that if patients or infants have an urgent need, they can apply to the Health Department on Route de Pélleux with a certificate from a registered doctor. The department will provide them at the controlled price.

Domestic Milk Powder. After overseas transportation was blocked, the source of imported milk powders such as Le Tu Jing, Ailan Baili, and Ke Ning was cut off. With limited stocks in this city, the Municipal Council imposed controls and price limits. Currently, the Shanghai Milk Products Factory's domestic products, An Jian Er and Jin Shi Pi, are available as substitutes. The price is equivalent to the price limit of imported milk powder, and it is available everywhere. The factory manufactures milk powder using fresh milk, which undergoes more than 20 procedures such as milk collection, disinfection, composition testing, congealing, milk drying, powder sifting, and vacuuming, and is refined using scientific methods. Its composition is water 5.36%, butterfat 24.53%, carbohydrates (milk sugar) 39.77%, protein 23.90%, and mineral salts 6.44%. According to the factory manager, only two types of domestic pure milk powder, An Jian Er and Jin Shi Pi, are produced. The factory raises 200 purebred yellow cattle, and the fresh milk produced is used as the raw material for the milk powder.

Moldy Corn Exudes Heat. Yesterday, my mother bought ten pounds of corn and placed it in a stainless steel wok to cook with rice. This morning, she found that the corn was exuding heat. Suspecting that it was due to the indoor heating, she moved the stainless steel wok outdoors. After several hours, it was still exuding heat. I don't know what the reason is. Zhang Zhenhua, No. 75, Lane 1238, Route Foch, 3/7.

Seeking Livelihood After Prolonged Illness. I have been bedridden for more than ten years and have no way to earn a living. I now plan to repair watches, clocks, and fountain pens for others. I do not know where I can buy books on such repairs or where there are correspondence schools for such skills. Please provide information.

### Year of Career Change

By Gan Cao

The year of Ren Wu is the year of the Horse, which means Mr. Ma Lang Tang is in charge. Since the tide of unemployment rushed in like a flood last December, this year has become the year of career change. People living in Shanghai are said to have known for a long time that the Shanghai Bund was going to become the "Shanghai collapse," and they are not really reluctant to leave Shanghai. The real problem is how to maintain the livelihood of their families after losing their jobs, which cannot be delayed. If there is food to eat in their hometown, then naturally they will return home. The problem is that their hometown, which they left many years ago, has long since run out of money and resources to provide for their livelihoods. So, they have no choice but to stay in Shanghai and look for another way to make a living. To find a livelihood, they have to worship Mr. Ma Lang Tang as their master and change careers. Every job produces an expert, and there are 360 lines of work. There will always be one that you can do. That's what everyone thinks.

Originally, the phrase "change careers" was a complaint made by business people at the end of the year when they settled their accounts. They wouldn't really change careers. But this year, with Mr. Ma Lang Tang in charge, changing careers is not just empty talk, but an actual behavior. If you can't open a car dealership, change to selling bicycles. At least it's still the car industry, just with different vehicles. For example, the Yangzi Automobile Company on Route d'Albert has set aside half of its store space to operate a local goods business, and the Xiangsheng Car Company on Route Min Tini Yin has also changed to a local goods store. That's changing from the "car" industry to the "food" industry, which is a real career change.

Bosses who used to run around to outport foreign ships doing Western clothing business have switched careers, and some who used to do civil ship transportation have switched to restaurants. That's a shift from the clothing industry to the "service" and "food" industries. But even some catering businesses that used to be lunch boxes have also changed to the clothing industry, and so on. There is a bookstore owner who is said to be switching to the Southern goods business. His reason for changing careers is that there is no fear of not having business in the Southern goods industry. Sugar, peanuts, soybeans, and Chinese yam are essential purchases for most families. Even if you can't do business, all the stock on hand can be used as food to temporarily stave off hunger, so you don't have to worry about starving to death in the store.

Many people have changed careers successfully. For example, someone who used to work in a bank has changed to a stationery business. All kinds of stationery have actually grown bigger and bigger, like carbon paper, which has risen from more than ten yuan a box to 120 yuan, and there is still a shortage of goods. A bottle of Citibank ink, which used to cost about one yuan, has risen to about ten yuan. It's scary to even hear about it. A former senior employee of a foreign company has changed to the soap and candle business. A movie theater owner buys up foreign pharmaceuticals and hoards pigments, watching the prices rise every day. He's making money hand over fist and doing quite well.

As the saying goes, "A scholar is useless." But scholars who have ideas still have ways. Someone who writes beautiful regular script has opened a calligraphy school. Those who used to write poetry and essays all day long have opened Chinese language tutoring classes. Those who are good at Shanghai-style English become private tutors. Young female scholars are even more resourceful, simply becoming dancers or actresses. Those who are really talented hoard cosmetics. But aside from female scholars, the career changes of scholars are always confined to the world of pen and ink. The best and most intelligent career change for a scholar is to become a fortuneteller. In this chaotic time, the more desperate people are, the more they want to try their luck. Because they want to try their luck, they want to find a cheap solution. The more they see gods and ghosts, the more they need character analysis and fortune-telling to cater to their needs. With so many people in Shanghai who want to try their luck, is there any fear of not having business as a fortuneteller? Making a fortune is what they expect. Seeing this, the author took a crash course in astrology and it has been very effective. According to the author's research, to predict the coming year of Ren Wu in one sentence, one should worship Mr. Ma Lang Tang as their master, that is, change careers, change careers. If you don't believe me, just wait and see.

### Japanese Military Notes Soar to Six Yuan; Cash Surges, Breaking Through 17,000 Yuan Barrier

The cash black market heated up, and Zhang Feng suddenly increased prices. The price had already soared beyond the 17,000 yuan mark, and people were excited. As a result, Japanese military notes soared to six yuan, leading to all sorts of speculation about the currency system. Moreover, since the end of last week, large investors have been buying up physical goods, and some gold shops, such as so-and-so, have temporarily stopped buying physical goods. The籌碼 [market stakes] are even more scarce. At the beginning of the morning, the price was shouted at around 16,000 yuan, but there was still more demand than supply. The first transaction price was 16,500 yuan, 1,700 yuan higher than last Saturday's closing price, and 1,100 yuan higher than the afternoon off-market price. Silver shops and silver houses came in strong, pushing the buying frenzy to 16,700 yuan. Securities firms reluctantly sold, briefly falling sharply to 16,000 yuan, and the lowest price shouted was 15,800 yuan. However, people's spirits were high, and after that, there was more chaos. Cash shops and silver shops, securities firms, and money exchange businesses all entered strongly, and retail investors competed to buy, and the price stepped up by 1,100-1,200 yuan. At 11:15 AM, it reached a high of 17,300 yuan. Northern gangs sold strongly, sharply retreating to 16,800 yuan. The buying frenzy reignited at noon, and the closing price was 17,100 yuan, 2,100-2,200 yuan higher than last Saturday, and 2,000 yuan higher than the afternoon off-market price of that day. There was a difference of 1,300 yuan on a normal day. Turnover was not strong. In the afternoon, it rose again to 17,800 yuan. Jewelry gold rose by 200 yuan per tael, to 1,800 yuan. At 5:30 PM, it rose again by 50 yuan, to 1,850 yuan. (Purchases were reduced by 200 yuan, and another opening was seen). Standard silver rose by 2 yuan to 16 yuan, and the black market price also rose to more than 14 yuan. Silver dollars were around 8 yuan and 50 cents.

Foreign Currency Market Conditions: British pounds and US dollars each rose by 25 yuan. The former rose to 390 yuan, and the latter rose to 400 yuan. US dollars also rose to 17 yuan and 6 jiao. Hong Kong notes rose by 1 jiao to 2 yuan and 9 jiao 5 fen. Large notes decreased by 5 fen, and military notes stepped up to 6 yuan.

### Shuang Ma Factory Singles Break Through 3,000 Yuan Mark

Cotton yarn market conditions: The rising trend was quite strong, which was because the price of Japanese yarn cloth continued to soar, causing people's spirits to rise accordingly. The opening price for 20-count Shuang Ma factory singles was 2,910 yuan. Afterwards, it was heard that the price of military notes had risen, and buying interest became stronger. The market continued to increase, and even broke through the 3,000 yuan mark. A slight setback was seen, but the current price of yarn thread is quite firm, and the buying momentum is still strong. The local price once reached 3,110 yuan. When the rising trend was sharp, some profit-takers sold, and it loosened again to 2,980 yuan. By the time the market closed, it had risen back to 3,000 yuan. 42-count Blue Phoenix was 6,500 to 6,820 yuan, 60-count Bull Head was 12,000 yuan, 42-count Fairy Peach was 6,620 yuan to 6,700 yuan, 40-count Double Tiger was 5,880 yuan, 32-count Red Happiness was 5,380 yuan, 32-count Golden Pagoda was 5,000 yuan, 20-count Moon Lute was 3,500 yuan, 20-count Fairy Peach was 3,400 yuan to 700 yuan, 20-count Blue Phoenix was 3,800 yuan, 20-count Water Moon was 3,950 yuan, 20-count Swiss Horse was 3,200 yuan, 20-count Double Earth was 3,270 yuan, 20-count Double Horse was 3,550 yuan, 16/8-count Weaver Girl was 3,380 yuan, 16/8-count Big Red was 3,100 yuan, 10-count Bao Yi was 2,250 yuan, 10-count Boy Scout was 2,300 yuan, and 10-count Double Earth was 2,280 yuan.

### Cotton Cloth Panic: Soaring Prices Reach a Frenzied Peak

Eastern Cloth Market: Yesterday's market saw a surge in Golden Thread Gauze, with merchants and fellow traders still [unclear characters]. At the same time, experienced traders occasionally sold, but only with the assurance of replenished stock. Consequently, panic spread, with a buying frenzy driving prices to an extreme. New orders for twelve-pound Dragon Head Fine Cloth opened in the morning at 151-152 yuan, rising steadily throughout the morning session to close at 166 yuan. Mid-range brands hovered around 150 yuan. The afternoon session opened at 165-166 yuan, with the peak reaching 170 yuan before profit-taking by retail investors pushed it back down to 164.50 yuan. The closing price was 23.50 yuan higher per bolt compared to the previous [unclear character]. However, spot Dragon Head and mid-range brands continued to rise, increasing by another 3-5 yuan compared to the morning. Evening closing prices were 151.50 yuan for spot Dragon Head and bank orders, 152.50 yuan for Colorful Ball Flying Fish, 52 yuan for Yang Crane, 51 yuan for Trumpet Five Blessings. Fine Twill saw a slightly more moderate increase, with Five Blessings Double Fish at 125 yuan, Real Shell at 123 yuan, and Four Gentlemen Serge reaching a peak of 5.50 yuan. Evening closing prices for 10-12 day orders were 5.25 yuan, Red Order New Tax was 5.10 yuan, and old July-September orders were 5 yuan.

Factory Cloth Market: Yesterday's market saw a sharp increase due to the soaring military notes, stimulating speculative sentiment. As a result, selling prices rose, especially sharply. White Cloth increased by over ten yuan per bolt, and bleached and dyed cloth also increased by ten to twenty yuan. Chick 190 was 205 yuan for Prussian Blue, White Cat Printed Cloth was 120 yuan, White Chrysanthemum Bleached Cloth was 132 yuan, Smiling Face Plain Fuchow Silk was 4.70 yuan, Hero Blue Cloth was 175 yuan, 16-pound Globe Coarse Cloth was 137 yuan, Flying Swan was 130 yuan, 11-pound Three [unclear character] was 102.50 yuan, Great Roc Fine Cloth was 132 yuan, and Noble Twill was 120 yuan. Over 600 transactions took place in Wood Street.

### Foreign Stocks Rise Strongly, Government Bonds Fall Alone

Government Bond Plunge: Yesterday's market continued to decline, with Tai Kang Cheng ceasing selling and starting to buy, while Yong Kang and Tong Yi released more stock, likely due to the massive surges in gold, cotton yarn, and military notes, prompting a shift in investment. After last Saturday's close, the gray market price was firm, but yesterday it reversed and declined again, which was quite unexpected. There were plenty of buyers in the market, such as Tai Kang Cheng, Tong Kang, Lian Yi, and Jiu Feng, while Yong Kang, Tong Yi, Lian He, and Da Zhong were all sellers. Market sentiment suggests a rebound is due given the significant price drop. However, confidence is lacking due to continuous selling by major players. As a result, the market continued to fall sharply, by 6 jiao to 1.6 yuan, with approximately 400,000-500,000 yuan in transactions. Details are listed in the table below.

Yesterday, the foreign stock market rose strongly, with 7,500 shares traded. Jardine Matheson Textile Mill rose from 24 yuan to 25 yuan, Sino-British Cotton Mill was 6.70 yuan, China Textile rose from 9.60 yuan to 10 yuan, Telephone was 23.50 yuan and 24 yuan, Tramway was 37.50 yuan, Paper was 6.10 yuan, Shanghai Velvet was 5.60 yuan to 6 yuan, all were transaction prices.

Baud was 2 yuan, Carlowitz was 1 yuan, all had [unclear character] buyers. Electric Power Preferred was 94 yuan [unclear character], Electric Power Bonds were 69 yuan, Asiatic Navigation was 7.30 yuan, Reclamation was 22 yuan, Kailan Mining was 32.50 yuan, Yieh Guang was 15.50 yuan, and Lange's were 12 yuan, all had buyers.

Heng Yeh was 10 yuan with sellers, it was said.

### Coarse Grains Surge

The coarse grains market is uniformly booming, driven by the surge in gold yarn and the resulting surge in sentiment. Investors are rushing to buy, especially the local shops, making the market exceptionally strong. Generally, bean prices rose by 3-5 yuan, bean cakes rose by 3-4 yuan, and red sorghum rose by 2-3 yuan. Sales included 1,300 bags of Tianjin Gold Yuan, priced at 174-177 yuan, over 200 bags of Chongming Sand Red, priced at 136-145 yuan, and over 400 bags of Sand [unclear character], priced at 95-98 yuan.

Wheat bran [unclear characters] hoarding houses [unclear characters] and inland households also inquired, so the market opened very tense in the morning. Under the competition of scattered households, the market suddenly took off. San Xin large bags opened at 76 yuan, then rose one yuan at a time to 77 yuan, 78 yuan, and 78.70 yuan. The afternoon buying interest did not wane, reaching as high as 80 yuan. Small bags were out of stock and did not open.

### Rice Market Without Official Prices

The rice market was temporarily closed yesterday. National rice has no formal trading, but peddlers are still active. Early thin rice from the South Road is retailed at 27-28 yuan per dou, and sold on the market for 320 yuan and 300 yuan, it is said.

### Cigarettes, Firewood, and Soap: All Soaring

The price surge in cigarettes has been rekindled. Due to drastic financial changes and public panic, people are scrambling to hoard goods, sparing no effort. Consequently, prices are rising across the board. British Brands are selling for 7,801 yuan per case, Old Knife brand for 6,800 yuan, Little Fairy brand for 4,700 yuan, Five Hua brand for 4,600 yuan, and Pin Hai brand for 6,300 yuan, all rising by 400-500 yuan compared to the previous day. Japanese cigarettes also followed suit, with Golden Gun brand at 1,920 yuan, Golden Building at 2,100 yuan, Red Rose brand at 3,150 yuan, Quan Lu brand at 2,450 yuan, and Guide brand at 1,720 yuan, also rising by over 28 [unclear character] yuan. The price surge in daily necessities is also strong. Due to scarce supply and strong sales, all goods are rising, including Phoenix Brand Matches at 2,500 yuan, Beautiful Brand at 2,550 yuan, Bai Xiang Mao soap at 175 yuan, Huang Xiang Mao soap at 165 yuan, and Gu Mu soap at 190 yuan, all creating unprecedented high prices.

### Sugar for Inland Sales

Besides allocating sugar to local retailers, it is rumored that about 50,000 bags are destined for sale inland, and stocks are expected to become increasingly thin.

### Western Dried Mussels Rise by One-Third

The supply of Western dried mussels has been cut off. Recently, some goods have emerged from sealed warehouses. Western medium dried mussels are opening at 735 yuan, and large dried mussels are at 766 yuan, more than one-third higher than the price at the end of January.

### Dried Lily Bulbs Costs Increase

After the transportation from Hong Kong was cut off, the sales of dried lily bulbs became sluggish, so the market price was often flat. However, as the prices of all goods have recently risen, the price of this item is still low. Moreover, the external costs from Su to Shanghai have recently increased, adding 60-70 yuan per piece, so the market has also turned firmer. Upper-grade is recently quoted at 170 yuan, and ordinary is at 150 yuan.

### Bananas (Part 2)

— Gao Jiannong

Jia Si Xie, in his Essential Skills for the Common People, also quoted Guang Zhi, saying: "...The fruit has horned fruitlets, six or seven inches long, with a stem of three or four inches. The fruitlets grow in rows on the stem, two by two, like embracing each other." These fruits sometimes follow each other in tiers, and each axis can weigh up to twenty-five kilograms! Can you imagine that this non-woody and fragile herbaceous plant can bear such a large and heavy batch of fruit?"

As for the flavor, color, and varieties of this berry, our ancestors have already discussed them in great detail. Ji Han in his Flora of the South says: "Sweet bananas... peel the skin of the fruitlets, the color is yellowish-white, the taste is like grapes, sweet and crisp, and can also relieve hunger. There are three types: the fruitlets are as large as a thumb, long and sharp, like goat horns, called 'Goat Horn Bananas', the taste is the sweetest and best. One type has fruitlets as large as goose eggs, like cow's milk, called Cow's Milk Bananas, which are slightly less than Goat Horn."

Spring and Autumn

### From the Fields

— Zhou Mo

Under the high cost of living, everyone feels it is difficult to live in Chang'an. Therefore, the unemployed only carry loads on their shoulders, traveling between Shanghai and its suburbs, carrying two dou of national rice to help feed the people of Shanghai. Those who have studied for a few years, all they can think of is "Go back, go back! My fields are overgrown, why not return?", lamenting the desolate fields and the displaced families. However, because prices are rising everywhere, if one claims to be "a commoner from the fields, plowing in Nanyang," in this year of plenty yet the wife cries from hunger, and the warm winter yet the child wails from cold, it is not easy for this commoner to leisurely plow the fields. Only the herdsboy who has just understood the meaning of things still has the elegant interest of hanging a book on the ox's horn. This is all because of the mistake of reading poetry and books, times have changed, and now when discussing the future "three visits to the thatched cottage," this unexpected encounter, of course, even if there is such a dream, one cannot reach this realm. However, looking back, one can only feel ashamed and willing to rot with the grass and trees.

Many people come from the fields, and even I don't need to see it as glory, nor do I need to see it as shame. Of course, I am a child from a farming family. In our childhood, we often felt that the countryside still preserves ancient customs, and we cannot help but feel that when rites are lost, we seek them in the countryside. Our elders never understood hoarding, nor did they know how to deceive. Everyone supported each other to live and stayed together until death. Later, we discovered that there are cities where one can live freely, seek profit, and even seek a way to satisfy one's desires. Who is without feelings? How can one refuse this? Therefore, they brought us, these formidable youngsters, to see the world. Farming became the work of fools, and tenant farmers took over. Coming from the fields became rushing to the foreign market. Sometimes, before the morning mist has cleared, one cannot help but wonder why we are here. However, it is only a sigh, and we never have the intention of letting our hair down and entering the mountains.

Over the past twenty years, I have seen a lot of the world, tasted a lot of life's flavors. For the sake of living, I have once again remembered that I came from the fields. The weeds are rampant, and the smoke is hazy. I don't know what my hometown looks like. Having left home at a young age, my local accent hasn't changed. If I return, I don't know if the children will meet me and not recognize me, and laugh and ask, "Where does the guest come from?"

In the midst of the return-to-the-village movement, for those who have problems with rice and coal, although we may share the sentiment of "we are all poor wanderers, why should we have met before?", we will naturally think about returning home. However, to be like Tao Yuanming, who finds pleasure in going to the garden every day, and whose door, though set up, is always closed, avoiding the dust and cutting off social interactions, and who is also happy with his destiny and has no doubts, is naturally not something that those who are ashamed of their empty pockets can do.

Returning to the fields, picking up the rusty farming tools again, not to mention the big talk of engaging in production, but only seeking personal warmth and food, avoiding dividing porridge to eat, then is today's thought of coming from the fields not tomorrow's return from the city?

Assorted Talks on the Arts

### Flower Drum Opera

— Ze Fu

Flower drum opera is a small opera popular in Hubei and Hunan, and is similar in nature to the Yangko dance in the north and the [unclear character] in the south. It is said that the origin of Hubei is due to the local pastoral songs, and the origin of Hunan is due to the tea-picking songs of Guangxi. Therefore, although the names are the same, the singing methods are different. In the past, Hubei used no other instruments except gongs and drums. When singing, it was like a high-pitched tune, and at the end, the people on the stage would help sing. In Hunan, in addition to gongs and drums, there is the accompaniment of the erhu. When singing, there is no chorus, just like ordinary songs. However, in recent years, Hubei's flower drum opera has also been greatly reformed, abolishing the chorus and adding the jinghu, and to distinguish it from the old flower drum opera, it has been renamed Chu Opera. In the past, the plays performed were mostly love stories, such as "Yingtai Crying at the Tomb", "Jinlian Teasing Uncle", "Twelve Longings", etc. Today, more attention is paid to ethical morality, and historical plays such as "Qu Yuan Throwing Himself into the River" and "Dong Yong Selling Himself" are also performed. However, Hunan's flower drum opera still maintains its original color, and there are no great historical figures to speak of at all. Such as "Zhang San Pan Jie", "Lanqiao Drawing Water", "Monk Begging for Alms", etc., are all nothing more than the love between men and women, as well as humorous jokes, and characters that are familiar to the public.

### Woman, Dog, Man

— Qian Changnian

He was a young man, the thing he feared the most was dogs, and the thing he liked the most was women.

He met a girlfriend, young and beautiful. One night, he and she were walking hand in hand on the street, when suddenly a ferocious hunting dog rushed towards her. At that time, he didn't know where the courage came from, and he kicked it away with one foot. From then on, he was no longer afraid of dogs, but women were still his favorite.

There came a day when his girlfriend became the wife of another man, so he had no choice but to spend all day playing with a newly purchased puppy.

What happened after that? It is said that this young man has changed his original opinion, because he has found that dogs will always faithfully follow their masters, and they will never be as clever as women.

Now, the thing he fears the most is women, and the thing he likes the most is dogs.

### Survival Relay Race

— Lin

Elementary school teachers have to integrate with the lives of their children, and they have to pay attention to the living conditions of each child. Xue Baozhu is a good student, but recently she has been absent from the common sense class on Saturday afternoons for several weeks. Mr. Liang asked her again and again, but she always shook her head with her neat braids, and her eyes shot out a kind of "mature" light.

Mr. Liang couldn't figure it out, so he went to Xue's house for a visit. He was received by Mrs. Xue. She explained the reason why Xue Baozhu was absent:

"Mr. Liang, the store can't buy briquettes, and the briquettes at home have been burned out. In the past, Aunt Zhang would go to the briquette factory early in the morning to queue up, and occasionally she could buy half a load. Recently, it's no longer possible. When I rush there in the morning, the tickets have already been issued. I heard that people are queuing up overnight. We can't eat raw rice. I saw that Baozhu only has one class on Saturday afternoons, so I told her to eat lunch and go to queue up. The queue is already very long. She doesn't want to miss class, but I can't help it. After dinner, Aunt Zhang will replace Baozhu to go home to eat and sleep. Aunt Zhang refuses to wait overnight, saying that if she has to wait overnight, she would rather not help people. So, before the curfew, I have to replace Aunt Zhang to come back, write the number at two o'clock in the night, issue the tickets at six o'clock tomorrow morning, and then buy briquettes with the tickets. People say that briquettes may not be sold anymore, so these few weeks I had to let Baozhu miss some classes. Please, Mr. Liang, give her some extra lessons when you have time."

After saying goodbye, Mr. Liang walked on the road, and he couldn't help but wonder: He often walked past the queues to buy briquettes, but he never thought that one of them would be his own student. Elementary school students playing relay races on the school playground are most enthusiastic about Baozhu. I didn't expect that she was also doing a survival relay competition in the square outside the school. I hope she will also win as often as she does in school.

### Sharing the Same Boat in Storms

— He Jia Zhi

(2) Sorrow and Joy

The street gradually had pedestrians, and the grain stores were also opening. He looked up and saw that the sun was shining on the earth, and the bamboo leaves and tree trunks across the river seemed to be sweating. A ripple rose on the river surface, and half of it was illuminated by the sun, flashing with a pattern-like beauty. He propped the cloth umbrella on the ground, stood up and walked out of the edge of the market. Several people came towards him, one of them called out "Young Master Ye." Wei Cheng nodded and greeted him, "Are you coming to town? The road is not very dry yet, but the weather is good. It's almost the end of the year, and everyone is hoping for good weather." The man also said a few polite words and walked past. Wei Cheng had learned this set of perfunctory behavior towards the villagers. Thinking about it carefully, that person recognized himself, but no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't remember his surname.

A place that an arrow can reach will not take much time to walk to. With a joyful heart, Wei Cheng happily ran and ran, and after a while, he saw dozens of old trees surrounding the black roof, the pink-white walls, and the forest of spears and halberds that was the fence, which was the ancestral hall of the Ye family, Shi De Tang Ye Mansion. He stepped on the ridges of the fields under his feet, and the wheat sprouts that were growing angrily in the fields were green and lovely. They received the warmth of the sun and the shock of the cold wind, as if they were about to stand up from the fields and run. Wei Cheng knew that this field was the inheritance passed down by the ancestors of the Ye family, and it was now jointly managed by his mother and aunt, and several farm workers and old women cultivated it. He became a little [unclear character] again.

Walking closer and closer, he reached the bamboo fence door. Several family members were standing at the doorway: two of them saw Wei Cheng and ran in; one was the farm worker Ah Xing, who came up to greet the young master. Seeing that Wei Cheng had no clothes bags or suitcases in his hands, he took the umbrella, saying, "Young master is back early. The eldest mistress and the second mistress said that the young master is coming back soon. If I had known that you were coming back today, I would have come to Huagang to pick you up." Wei Cheng walked into the bamboo fence door. In a square, a handcart was parked. Wei Cheng said, "Whose car is this?" Ah Xing walked in front, without answering. Walking through the front door and the second door, he still followed his old habits, walked into the Shuangmei Study, located west of the living room, and reverently bowed three times to the portrait of his father, Lord Aitang.

### Learning the Guqin

Last year, I studied the guqin from Mr. Wu Jinglue of Yushan. At that time, Mr. Tang Weilao and others were encouraging him to set up a studio in the Xiao Sheng Qin Yun Room. The young and old who followed him were mostly women, totaling dozens of people. He taught all the fingering and music theory with great care. In less than half a year, they could play and sing, and the lightness, heaviness, speed, and slowness all conformed to the rhythm. When I retired to play the guqin, such as High Mountains and Flowing Water, Wild Geese Descending on the Sandbank, Fisherman's Dialogue and other pieces, I could also play them clearly and melodiously. My thoughts wander beyond the thousands of miles of lakes and mountains, and the joy is indescribable. On every spare day, Mr. would often gather his followers and have them play the pieces he taught together, in order to encourage them. Mr. and his friends also accompanied them with the se and xiao from time to time, and the sound was loud and clear, leisurely, and the joy was even more harmonious. From this, I know that our learning is progressing day by day. Alas, learning the guqin is not an easy task! Few can do it, and even fewer are proficient. If the teacher is not the right person, then they will be ignorant of the direction throughout their lives. I have followed Mr. for a long time, admiring Mr.'s learning. I am fortunate that I can get guidance, and there is leisure in my melancholy and worries. Can this not be called a joyful thing? I describe this to tell my fellow enthusiasts, and also to express my admiration.
