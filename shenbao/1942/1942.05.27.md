### Kharkov War Moves South, German Offensive Intensifies

Soviet Army Adopts Steady and Reliable Tactics

Berlin, 25th (Havas) – A German war correspondent, who recently arrived from the front lines, reports that fierce fighting is taking place both north and south of the city of Kharkov. Thick smoke obscures the sky, and several villages have been lost and regained, changing hands five times in a single day. All the houses have been destroyed and are currently burning. A large number of abandoned Soviet tanks and various military equipment are scattered across the battlefield. German supply trains are continuously transporting food and ammunition from the southwest to the front lines.

London, 26th (Reuters) – According to reports from Moscow last night, the fighting in the Kharkov area and the Izium-Barvenkovo ​​area (located southeast of Kharkov) has intensified in recent days, seemingly approaching a decisive battle. Although the battle zone is not very large, the weapons used are substantial. Despite the German forces' desperate efforts to contain the Red Army's offensive in the Kharkov area over the past 24 hours, the Red Army has still made progress. The German forces are now engaging them with a large number of warplanes. According to a Reuters correspondent in Moscow, the Red Army is using artillery to cover the frontline infantry, both to prevent German tank counterattacks and to bombard German forward positions, enabling the Red Army infantry to advance. The Soviet military authorities are now adopting a steady and reliable tactic, consolidating any new gains made by the Germans before launching another attack, to prevent the danger of German tanks flanking their wings. As for the Izium-Barvenkovo ​​line, the German offensive is very fierce, demonstrating that after failing to break through the Red Army's line of defense last week, a portion of the reinforcements that arrived have already joined the battle. According to a military announcer on Moscow radio, the fighting in that area continued throughout the night, from dawn to dusk, with unprecedented ferocity. The Red Army has captured several villages and towns. The German forces initially attacked with 150 tanks, covered by artillery and aircraft, but the Red Army repelled them and then launched an infantry assault, driving the Germans out of their defensive fortifications. A Soviet tank unit fought continuously for two days, reportedly repelling 35 German tanks.

Moscow, 26th (Reuters) – The Soviet communiqué issued at noon today stated that our forces were consolidating their positions in the Kharkov area last night. In the Izium and Barvenkovo ​​areas, the army is resisting mixed enemy tank and infantry units. There have been no significant battles on other lines.

Soviet Army Attempts to Break Through, Fierce Fighting All Night Long

Berlin, 26th (Haitong News Agency) – According to responsible military figures here, the Soviet forces, which were surrounded by German and Allied forces south of Kharkov on the morning of the day before yesterday, attempted to break through, with large numbers of tanks assisting in the battle. Fierce fighting continued throughout the day, resulting in heavy Soviet casualties. The German forces concentrated their attacks and finally crushed the Soviet resistance. German aircraft also assisted in the battle from within the clouds, with considerable success.

Berlin, 25th (Havas) – According to a report broadcast by German radio a moment ago, the battle situation on the Kharkov front yesterday was still fierce, but there were no new developments. Our forces there are still gradually advancing. At dawn yesterday, the surrounded Red Army units attempted to launch a fierce offensive under the cover of artillery and mechanized units, hoping to break through, but after a month of intense fighting, they were finally repelled by our forces. North of Orel, our motorized units launched a fierce attack on several enemy positions. As a result of the fierce battle, the Red Army abandoned an important village and suffered heavy losses. A large amount of military supplies were captured or destroyed by our forces. In the central sector, our forces continued to advance, capturing 80 enemy bunkers. Southwest of Lake Ilmen, the Red Army infantry offensive has reached its limit. At the same time, our air force, regardless of the adverse weather, is carrying out major operations in the area. The enemy troops are hiding in the forests, but our aircraft continue to bomb enemy transportation lines and troop concentration points. Several railway stations have been severely damaged. In addition, our aircraft attacked the port of Sevastopol in Crimea, damaging a cargo ship docked in the port. Naval facilities and anti-aircraft positions in the port were also directly hit by our aircraft. Our aircraft shot down one enemy aircraft and destroyed two aircraft on the ground in air combat. In the areas of the Taman Peninsula and Murmansk-Leningrad, our air force was also quite active, destroying a bridge on the Kovda River, disrupting railway traffic between Murmansk and Arkhangelsk.

According to a United Press dispatch from New Delhi, the difficult circumstances of Stilwell's entry into India from Burma were reported as follows: Stilwell's party consisted of 104 people, including an American major general from the Chongqing-based Burmese army, 19 Burmese caregivers, and an American medical team.

### Roosevelt Asks Congress for Additional Navy Funding, Totaling Over $600 Million; Nationwide Registration Deadline for Youths Aged 18 and 19

Washington, 25th (Havas) – President Roosevelt today submitted a message to Congress requesting additional funding for the Navy, totaling $614,425,000. The majority of this will be used to supplement the organization of the Ordnance Department, and a portion will be used to build merchant ships and other auxiliary vessels. He also stated that this additional expenditure would greatly benefit society, as it would create new jobs for tens of thousands of workers. Although there are currently three million unemployed workers nationwide, this number will continue to decrease in the future. It is hoped that all producers will abandon their prejudices against racial discrimination when recruiting workers for wartime industries.

New York, 26th – President Roosevelt has set June 30 as the registration deadline, ordering all youths aged 18 and 19 nationwide to register. From now on, the work of mobilizing manpower has been fully completed. These age groups were not originally subject to military service, but this registration may allow Congress to change the current conscription age (currently set at 20). At the same time, the Army and Navy have also been allowed to enlist youths aged 18 and 19. An Associated Press reporter cited sources in Washington as saying that preparations for changing the minimum conscription age are nearing completion. The current military service legislation is related to the salaries of conscripted soldiers. The House of Representatives advocates for a minimum monthly salary of $50 for soldiers, while the Senate still insists on $45.

U.S. Income Tax Collection Method

Washington, 25th (Havas) – The House Ways and Means Committee has decided to conduct a special study of Treasury Secretary Morgenthau's request to authorize the department to deduct 10% of income tax in advance from the income of all taxpayers, in order to save taxpayers the trouble of paying taxes later. If this case is implemented in the future, the U.S. income tax collection method will be comparable to that of the United Kingdom. In other words, regardless of salary or various private property income, the income tax payable will be deducted at the time of actual payment. The fact that British workers' wages are paid after deducting income tax is one example.

Ankara, 26th (Haitong News Agency) – The Turkish Minister of Finance has submitted Turkey's new budget to the parliamentary committee for review. The military expenditure alone amounts to a huge sum of 394,000,000 pounds, an increase of 84,000,000 pounds over the previous year. In addition, the government must raise public debt of 120,000,000 pounds as special funding for national defense. Therefore, Turkey's total military expenditure this year will reach over 500,000,000 pounds, a record-breaking amount.

Istanbul, Turkey, 25th (Havas) – The National Assembly (Turkish Parliament) convened today, and Finance Minister Agrali reported on the financial situation, stating that the ordinary national defense budget for this fiscal year reached 101,514,000 Turkish pounds, and the special budget reached 120,000,000 Turkish pounds. In the future, the government may continue to request Congress to allocate additional funding. As for the general financial situation of our country, the amount of paper money in circulation has reached 529 million pounds, an increase of 300 million pounds compared to 1939. This normal inflation situation is due to the increase in commercial transactions and the expansion of subsidies to agriculture and industry. In the future, the government has not only decided to prevent the expansion of paper money circulation, but also to recover a portion of the old currency. In addition, in view of the excellent results of the recent issuance of long-term public debt, the government will issue another 50 million pounds of domestic public debt in the short term.

Three Axis Powers Naval Joint Operations Plan

Berlin, 26th, Huitong News Agency: A German government spokesman today announced for the first time the joint naval operations plan of Germany, Italy, and Japan, elaborating in detail on the shipping and maritime situation of Britain and the United States. It is claimed that the victories of the German, Italian, and Japanese navies in the past few weeks clearly indicate the existence of a comprehensive cooperation plan for naval operations among the three countries, forcing the enemy to disperse their fleets around the globe. Therefore, when an American cruiser was sunk by German aircraft in the Arctic Ocean, an Italian submarine also sank an American battleship in the South Atlantic, and the Japanese Navy sank two aircraft carriers, one battleship, and many other warships in the Battle of the Coral Sea. Due to the vast distances, Roosevelt and Churchill had to divide their limited fleets and station them in broad areas. As a result, the Axis navies have gained the advantage of internal line operations. The battles engaged in by the German, Italian, and Japanese navies in various locations are all offensive battles, aimed at striking the long transportation lines of Britain and the United States and forcing them to take a broad defensive stance. The operational scope of German and Italian submarines extends from the mouth of the St. Lawrence River in the north to Fernando de Noronha Island south of the equator. In this vast area, the U.S. light naval forces are unable to protect shipping. The United States, feeling the serious threat of submarines, has had to use a large portion of its arms industry to manufacture weapons to counter submarines. What the United States urgently needs are countless ships, cannons, and trained sailors, but despite the urgent need, there is no ready supply. Due to the necessity of defending against submarines, Roosevelt's shipbuilding plan has been delayed considerably. According to figures released by U.S. officials, 139 U.S. merchant ships have been launched since the beginning of December last year, but whether this number is accurate is not guaranteed, and it is rumored that the engines for most of these ships have not been manufactured. Even if this figure is accurate, the full shipbuilding capacity of the United States, spending 180 days, has only produced 900,000 tons of ships. However, the ships lost since the United States entered the war on December 8 have already exceeded this number fivefold. The number of ships sunk by German submarines has exceeded 3 million tons, and the war record of the Italian and Japanese navies has also exceeded 1.5 million tons. Since the United States entered the war, the loss of enemy warships and merchant ships has increased sharply. Since December 8 of last year, more than 14.5 million tons of British ships or ships chartered by Britain have been sunk, and in the 27 months before the 8th, the number of British ships sunk also exceeded one-third of this number. Roosevelt and Churchill are unable to make up for this huge loss of ships and dare not tell their people the truth. In November of last year, Churchill claimed that the submarine danger had been completely removed, and Roosevelt also instructed his Secretary of the Navy in December to announce to the world that the British fleet could destroy the Axis countries within 90 days. Now that the 90-day period has passed, the strength of the Axis countries has only increased, while Britain and the United States themselves have encountered an unsolvable shipping problem. Now that the Axis countries have a joint naval operations plan, the severity of the blows suffered by Britain and the United States in the future will only increase day by day.

Italian Submarine in the Atlantic Returns to Base Yesterday

Milan, 26th, Huitong News Agency: An Italian submarine led by Olivieri, after sinking five enemy ships totaling 48,000 tons in the Atlantic, returned to base this morning. When asked about his experience in ocean warfare, Olivieri replied that when encountering a giant American oil tanker, one torpedo was not enough to sink it, so it was necessary to simultaneously use the submarine's cannons to bombard the upper part of the oil tanker to cause it to explode and achieve the goal. Subsequently, within four days, two more oil tankers and two giant ships were sunk by Italian submarines.

Lisbon, 26th, Huitong News Agency: The Associated Press has confirmed that an American battleship, Maryland-class, has been sunk by an Italian submarine, and its crew of 56 men has been rescued by an Argentine coal ship.

### Special Column on Near Eastern Countries

1.  Opening Remarks

I remember that before the outbreak of the European War two years ago, and even after it had already broken out, the prevailing view was that the Balkan Peninsula was the fuse for the later fallout between Germany and the Soviet Union. Sure enough, the defeat of Greece and the shift in Bulgaria's allegiance led to the two European powers finally meeting on the battlefield.

Now, with the German-Soviet conflict nearing its first anniversary and the German-led spring offensive gradually unfolding, the scope of the war in the Far East continues to expand. Consequently, people's attention is gradually focusing on this relatively unfamiliar corner of the world—the Near East. There seems to be a conscious or unconscious awareness that this vast land will soon become another stage for human slaughter, another arena for the ravages of the god of war. Further reflection might lead one to consider that the Near East's engulfment in the vortex would entail more than just a few battles. In reality, it could well be the most exciting and crucial act of the world war because it would serve as the catalyst for the "merging" of the European and Asian theaters of war. With the two major global blocs exerting all their strength and fiercely clashing, it could arguably be considered the focal point of the entire drama.

Just as the Balkans were the fuse for the German-Soviet war, the Near East will be the point of convergence for the European and Asian theaters. Regardless of how the war situation evolves, a systematic introduction to the geography, history, ethnic divisions, political status quo, and even strategic value of the Near East seems like a meaningful endeavor.

The term "Near East" is merely a customary designation rather than a legally defined one. Consequently, opinions vary on the scope it encompasses. Some say it includes Eastern Europe and Asia Minor, while others argue that Egypt should also be included. Some even include Persia (Iran, which should actually be called the Middle East) and Arabia. This article focuses on explaining the basic situation of the Near Eastern countries, so it can be broadly divided into three main parts: the Eastern Europe and Asia Minor portion, including Turkey, Syria, Palestine, and Transjordan; the African portion, including Egypt, Libya, and Anglo-Egyptian Sudan; and the Persian Gulf portion, including Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen.

Among the regions listed above, some are independent states, while others are protectorates or colonies in terms of political structure. In terms of political affiliation, some are neutral, some are occupied, and some completely side with one of the warring parties. In terms of ethnicity, they are almost entirely nations of the same religion.

Since the German army launched its offensive on the Kerch Peninsula on May 8, the intensity of the fighting has clearly drawn global attention. Whether the German-proclaimed spring offensive, said to involve six million soldiers, refers to this campaign is uncertain, but it can at least be considered the prelude to a full-scale offensive. Perhaps the German army intends to feint in the east while attacking in the west, in order to launch another surprise lightning strike elsewhere. Or perhaps the German army's primary goal is to seize the Caucasus region, both to plunder its oil resources and to secure the area south of the Volga River as a temporary conclusion to the war against the Soviet Union. From there, they could take the Caucasus route to directly attack Iran. According to the observations of French military expert General Duval some days ago, this battle will be decided in Iran, south of the Caucasus. If the German army achieves its objectives on the Kerch Peninsula, it will inevitably launch a "pincer offensive" towards the Caucasus along both the north and south coasts of the Sea of Azov. In other words, they would advance northward from Rostov and southward from Kerch as a base, thereby directly attacking the Caucasus oil fields. However, the Soviet Union is naturally on alert. On one hand, they have stationed armored forces and constructed fortifications in the Kerch region. On the other hand, they have launched counterattacks on three fronts—north, central, and south—as a diversionary tactic. The northern front aims for the outer lines of Leningrad, the central front targets the city of Kalinin northwest of Moscow, and the southern front aims for Belgorod northeast of Kharkov. Among these, the southern branch led by Timoshenko is the most formidable. Its mission is clearly to encircle the rear of the German forces in the Donets Basin, thereby alleviating the German pressure on the Kerch Peninsula.

From the German army's initial focus on the Caucasus line, it is evident that Hitler cannot forget the oil fields in that area. Of course, he cannot ignore the oil resources of Iran and Iraq. To strengthen their offensive against the Soviet Union, it is expected that they will inevitably return to North Africa and attempt to attack Egypt and the Suez Canal in the near future. In this regard, the German effort must not only maintain the smooth flow of supplies and troops in the Mediterranean Sea but also consider the natural obstacles of the Libyan desert. The recent continuous bombing of Malta by the German and Italian air forces and the widespread rumors of the German army's efforts to expand its airborne transport units undoubtedly indicate that the former aims to eliminate the British navy's base in the heart of the Mediterranean, while the latter seeks to acquire the most powerful and effective weapon for military operations in North Africa: aerial transport. As long as the Axis powers are confident in their ability to ensure smooth transport in the Mediterranean and maintain sufficient air superiority over North Africa, General Rommel (commander of the German forces in North Africa), who has been lying dormant for a long time, will inevitably advance into Egypt, inevitably launch a major air bombardment on the great port of Alexandria, and inevitably engage in a decisive battle with British General Auchinleck. If the eastward advance proceeds smoothly and can coordinate with the war on the Caucasus front, it would be another "pincer offensive" on a larger scale, targeting the entire Near East. In other words, one force would advance southward from the Caucasus, while the other would advance eastward from Libya, with the ultimate goal of meeting in Asia Minor. Under these circumstances, the critical importance of the Near East is not hard to imagine. Therefore, we can say that although the German spring offensive is currently limited to the Kerch Peninsula line, it is expected that it will involve the entire Near East in the near future. From this, we can see the increasing need for us to examine the situation in the Near East.

The Duke of Gloucester, the British King's brother, has been sent to the Middle East, reportedly with a special mission. Mr. Casey (former Australian ambassador to the United States), specially appointed by the British War Cabinet as plenipotentiary to the Near East, has arrived in Cairo and convened the so-called Middle East Supply Committee. Furthermore, Indian troops have arrived in Cyprus to reinforce the defenses. All of this demonstrates that the British government has not neglected its defenses in the Near East. Those who pay attention to the global situation should watch and wait for the decisive developments in this corner of the world!

### Money Trade Preparatory Bank Allocates Funds; Cash Clearing Clears Head; Remittance Clearing Firms Each Receive 25,000 Yuan, and Yuan-Character Firms Receive 12,500 Yuan; Second Clearing Begins June 1st

In order to regulate the finances of member banks and firms, the Bank United Preparatory Committee and the Money Trade United Preparatory Bank have allocated a large amount of cash to handle the clearing of head notes. As a result, the market is gradually stabilizing, and the trend of head discount水 gradually subsides.

Stabilizing the Market is Imminent

Recently, due to the manipulation of speculators, the head discount水 rate has risen again. Therefore, it was decided to conduct cash clearing of head notes again. The Money Bank has already received 1.4 million yuan in cash from the Bank Union and has notified member firms yesterday to use clearing of head notes. The regulations stipulate that each remittance clearing member firm will receive 25,000 yuan, and each yuan-character firm will receive 12,500 yuan. The exchange period lasts until May 30th. As for the next clearing, it is rumored to be scheduled from June 1st to 10th. After the Money Bank receives the funds, it will issue another notice to proceed.

Banks Mutual Clearing Conducts Self-Standardization

The clearing of each bank is handled by the Bank United Preparatory Committee, and the exchange amount is determined according to the actual needs of each bank. It is also heard that all legitimate banks and firms refuse to engage in head discount水 business. However, some small money changers repeatedly manipulate to profit, which is highly inappropriate. The authorities will take measures to ban them in order to facilitate legitimate transactions in various industries.

### Restaurants, Movie Theaters, etc. Revise Prices

According to the English-language North China Daily News, after department stores, hotels, and apartments revised their prices using savings certificates, yesterday, taverns, restaurants, and movie theaters also revised their prices using savings certificates. Starting today, silk, wool, and cotton cloth stores will also adopt the same measures. The price revision for the past two days will use a 2:1 exchange rate.

According to Dōmei News Agency, the Xingya Academy's Central China Liaison Department issued a statement yesterday stating that few department stores previously marked prices. In the future, companies will be encouraged to mark prices, and each department store will cooperate with the authorities' policies to implement this. The authorities will also revise prices for major restaurants, movie theaters, silk shops, cotton cloth shops, and wool shops in the concessions. Restaurants and movie theaters will implement the revised prices starting on the 26th, while silk, cotton cloth, and wool shops will implement them starting on the 27th. Because the discount has reached a ratio of 1:2, each industry will calculate accordingly. Therefore, in general, the old price on the 25th will be reduced by 50% to ensure that the price does not actually increase. The restaurants revising prices this time include Xin Ya, Jinmen, Xinhua, Jinghua, Hongmian, Ronghua, Meihua, Nanhua, Yihong, Dayuan, Xinghualou, Dongya, Dadong, Xinxin, Guanshengyuan, and more than 30 others. The movie theaters include Da Guangming, Guanglu, Nanjing, Majestic, Lido, Dahua, Cathay, Great Shanghai, New Light, Hu Guang, Jin Cheng, and others.

### Bureau Rice at 7.6 Yuan per Half Liter; Implemented Starting Thursday

According to the Municipal Council's announcement, starting on Thursday, May 28 of this year, until otherwise specified, the maximum retail price of Municipal Council rice in the Public Concession is 3.8 savings certificates or 7.6 old yuan per half liter, at the buyer's choice.

### Rents License Deadline Approaching; Decision Not to Extend

The number of Municipal Council housing sublease licenses issued has been small in recent days. According to the reporter's investigation from the Datong News Agency, a total of 40 licenses were collected from the central, northwest, east, and west districts yesterday. Including the previous ones, a total of 41,098 licenses have been issued. With only five days until the deadline today, the authorities have decided not to extend the period.

### Municipal Council Taxes Should Be Paid on Time, Otherwise the Bureau Will Sue

The Municipal Council announced yesterday that Section 17 of the Land Regulations stipulates that anyone who violates the regulations is liable to a fine of no more than 300 yuan, imprisonment for no more than six months, or other fair punishment measures. Therefore, anyone who fails to pay the various taxes that the Bureau is authorized to collect under the regulations on time will be subject to criminal or civil prosecution by the Bureau.

### Today's Allocation of Bureau Rice Still Totals More Than 10,000 Bags

The Municipal Council Rice Grain Office will allocate rice to rice shops today at a legal tender price of 576 yuan per bag, which must be increased again. Rice will still be distributed from Mitsubishi Warehouse, Taikoo Warehouse, and Zhejiang Industrial Warehouse, totaling more than 10,000 bags. The rice issued today is for sale on Sunday. After the Rice Grain Management Committee stipulated that rice shops should sell rice from the Bureau on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, users such as factories, hospitals, schools, and office buildings with more than 30 people who apply for rice from the Municipal Council are not subject to date restrictions and are accepted as usual.

### From the 25th of This Month, French Concession Water and Electricity Prices Increase - Electricity Costs More Than Four Times the Old Price - Water Prices Double, Tram Price Increases Still Under Discussion

Following the Public Concession's three major public utilities—water, electricity, and gas—being approved by the Municipal Council to revise their prices from the 20th of this month, the French Concession, in order to take consistent steps with the Public Concession, has also issued an announcement by the French Tram and Electricity Company a few days ago, determining that from the 25th of this month, the method of collecting water and electricity fees will be revised.

Revised New Prices for Electricity and Water

Although the newly set prices have not been fully disclosed, according to a reporter from the Datong News Agency who inquired with the company yesterday, the new prices being revised include electricity and tap water fees. The old price for electricity was 7.4 cents in legal tender per unit, and the new price is 1.56 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes per unit, which is about four times the old price. The new price for electricity in the Public Concession's Shanghai Power Company is 1 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes per unit, but a fuel adjustment fee must also be added. The French Concession does not have this fee, so the electricity costs in the two concessions are roughly the same. As for the tap water fee in the French Concession, the price has not increased, only the calculation method has been changed to Central Reserve Bank notes, that is, the previous charge of 4.6 cents in legal tender per cubic meter, now requires 4.6 cents in Central Reserve Bank notes. All water and electricity consumption dates ending on or after May 25th will be charged according to the new prices.

Tram Fare Increase Undecided

The Shanghai Times reported that the General Manager of the Shanghai French Water and Electricity Company, Mr. Ducrailes, stated yesterday (the 25th) that the French Concession's electricity fees will now increase by about double and will be charged in Central Reserve Bank notes. The water fee will remain unchanged, but it will also be charged in Central Reserve Bank notes. This new fee will apply to all bills up to yesterday, and the revised electricity consumption fee calculated in Central Reserve Bank notes will be at the same level as the electricity fee in the Public Concession. Furthermore, according to personnel from the electricity companies of the two concessions, the fares for buses and trams in the French Concession and trams in the Public Concession have not yet been decided. The French Concession's fares may increase after June 1st, but a final decision has not yet been made. As for the Public Concession's fare issue, it is still under consideration, but it is generally judged that there will be no fare increase before June 1st. Regarding the matter of trams traveling directly from the southern district of Suzhou Creek to Hongkou, the company has not made any further announcements.

### French Concession Resident Guarantee Forms - Distribution Throughout the Territory Completed - Guarantor Qualifications Must Be Carefully Reviewed

After the implementation of the Baojia system in the French Concession, the entire territory has been divided into district Baojia units, and the Baojia chiefs have also been elected and are now in office. At the same time, the Baojia chiefs have begun to work these days, and have distributed the newly printed household registration forms and resident guarantee forms to each household for accurate completion, so that they can obtain residence permits later. Each household should fill out two copies of the household registration form and guarantee form. Each household must have one guarantor from the same house number or from the same three-room capacity (who must reside in the French Concession), and must be jointly guaranteed by the second landlord of the residence. All second landlords can be guaranteed by another second landlord or a shop guarantor.

### Former Jianzhong Bank Creditor Group - Announcement of Debt Allocation

The creditor group of the former Jianzhong Commercial Bank in this port, after mediation in the 27th year of the Republic of China, the remaining assets of the bank were taken over by the creditor group.

Yesterday, a special announcement was made to all creditors to allocate 37% of the original debt amount in advance.

### Public Organizations - Will Be Re-registered

According to a message from the Public Concession Police Department, all public organizations in the Public Concession, including clubs, must re-register with the Special High Division.

### Chinese Evacuation Committee Announces - Overview of Evacuation Work - More Than 50,000 People Sent Away in the Past Two Months, Future Focus Will Be on Evacuating Women and Children

Yesterday, the Public Concession Chinese Evacuation Committee released an overview of its work, stating that after the incident in the 26th year of the Republic of China, residents from the suburbs flocked to the concessions due to the war, and the population density of this city became unprecedented. This city was originally an industrial and commercial metropolis, and the supply of all food and industrial raw materials depended on other ports. Therefore, if transportation was convenient and there was no shortage of food supply, it would not be difficult to support the needs of the city's citizens. However, since the outbreak of the war, overseas transportation has been completely cut off. Not only has the food supply for the city's residents been severely threatened, but also the source of industrial raw materials has been cut off, and the inability to export goods has led to a sluggish market and a sharp increase in unemployment. The only way to alleviate the food panic in the concessions was to evacuate a portion of the citizens who did not need to stay in Shanghai and were unemployed, and the evacuees themselves could escape the shackles of high prices.

Reasons for Organization

Evacuation work is not easy. The Municipal Council felt the urgency of the evacuation work and consulted with the relevant authorities to entrust the Shanghai Volunteer Corps to issue special return home permits. However, in order to make the work more effective and expand the scope, the Chinese Evacuation Committee was formally established on February 6, 31st year of the Republic, specializing in the evacuation of personnel from various hometown associations and professional groups. Although order has been restored in the suburbs, most of the residents who moved to Shanghai are hesitant to move back. Therefore, using the existing hometown associations and other groups to promote evacuation work not only provides convenience for the evacuees to take care of each other, but also achieves greater efficiency and success in the overall evacuation work. Since its establishment, the work of the committee has become increasingly intense, and the number of applicants from various groups has increased enthusiastically.

Focus of Work

The establishment of the reform was initiated by the Chinese Directors, and Chen Junhong was in charge of its affairs. Starting from February 8th, it officially began working at No. 277, Fuzhou Road, Municipal Council Building. The internal organization strives for simplicity and strictness, all work strives for speed, and efforts are made to provide convenience for the evacuees, so as to accelerate the evacuation work, and eliminate many unnecessary troubles for the application procedures of those who want to return home. The focus of the work is on systematic and orderly evacuation, not on sporadic evacuation. The mission is to accelerate evacuation and facilitate citizens. At the beginning of its establishment, letters were sent to various hometown associations, trade associations, and other groups, requesting their cooperation in order to achieve this goal and mission.

Entrustment Method

The main work of the committee can be divided into two parts. The first part is to entrust various hometown associations, trade associations, and other groups to act as agents for issuing special return home permits and preferential boat and cart fares. The second part is to accept applications from various hometown associations and groups and coordinate group evacuation matters such as boat and cart arrangements. Regarding the first part of the work, after officially starting work on February 8th, letters were sent to various groups requesting cooperation. Starting from February 9th, various groups came one after another to claim these permits and half-price coupons. From February 9th to April 20th, dozens of units acted as agents for the committee, issuing 55,890 tickets. With so many issuing groups, the evacuation work became more active, and the procedures for citizens to obtain certificates became simpler and more convenient. The committee then compiled the reports returned by various groups and the stubs of the return home permits, and analyzed them statistically, so that the total number of evacuations could be accurately obtained, and the occupations and destinations of the evacuees were classified and recorded in registers for future reference.

Contacting Boats and Carts

Regarding the second part of the work, there were a total of two times. One was to Xiamen, with a total of 143 people, and the other was to Hankou, with a total of 100 people. Those going to Xiamen took the Jinmen Maru, and those going to Hankou took the Jinshan Maru. Because transportation between this city and various ports is very inconvenient at present, except for neighboring ports, citizens leaving Shanghai often have no way to set off. The committee was assisted by the East Asia Shipping Company, which not only enabled citizens traveling to distant ports to board ships as early as possible, but also still provided half-price preferential treatment. However, due to the different destinations and departure dates of the evacuees, the evacuation work was very difficult to carry out in groups. Therefore, various hometown associations were specially requested to register the citizens participating in group evacuation one by one, and when a certain number was reached, or when there were enough ships, all necessary procedures would be handled on their behalf.

### Gaole Carbon Paper - Counterfeit Goods Abound

Gaole brand carbon paper, produced by the German merchant Gaole Foreign Company, is deeply loved by a group of people in society due to its excellent quality. Recently, there have been many counterfeiters outside the foreign company, and counterfeit goods are flooding the market. It was reported to the police station, and therefore many cases were solved. A few days ago, Zhang Yunsheng, a Chinese detective from the Huishan Police Station, and detective Wang Lansheng learned that the Meili Paper Box Factory at No. 4, Lane 670, Haining Road was selling counterfeit Gaole carbon paper. They immediately went to investigate and seize it. They arrested the shop owner Tang Youfu and his younger brother Tang Laohu, as well as the shop assistant Fan Bole, and confiscated 1,020 empty paper boxes, six wooden molds, eleven packs of carbon paper, and forty boxes, and took them to the police station for investigation.

### Municipal Council Concert Seating Prices

The Municipal Council Orchestra is scheduled to hold its final symphony concert at the Lyceum Theatre at 8:00 PM on Sunday, May 31st. The program has been arranged into three parts, with a total of ten sections. The seating prices are divided into four types: 10 yuan, 6 yuan, 5 yuan, and 4 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes.

### Rice Coupons to be Distributed to Citizen ID Holders - Distribution to Commence Upon Completion of Household Survey - Cooperative to be Established to Raise Rice Funds for Common People

Shanghai Times reported, according to the Allied News Agency, the Japanese Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun reported last night (May 25th) that the issuance of rice to Chinese people in the Public Concession through a coupon system is expected to be implemented in mid-June. This move will alleviate the difficulty for citizens to purchase rice and eliminate the queuing situation in front of rice shops. The implementation method is to distribute rice coupons to Chinese residents through the Baojia system. However, only those holding citizen IDs can receive rice coupons. In other words, rice coupons will only be issued to permanent citizens. According to this system, transit passengers in Shanghai cannot receive rice coupons, which will ease the food problem for the people. It is heard that residents of the Public Concession will soon organize a cooperative to raise rice funds for the middle and lower classes. The French Concession is handling this in the same way.

Three-Quarters of a Pound of Rice Coupons to be Issued Daily

According to the Allied News Agency, a rice purchase system with coupons for Chinese people in the Shanghai Concessions will be implemented starting in mid-June. At that time, the authorities of the two concessions will send rice purchase coupons to each family along with the tax payment notices for their use. The allocation amount is generally based on the current Municipal Council rice allocation standard, with a quarter of a pound per adult per day, and half for children under five years old. After the implementation of this method, the current inconvenience of purchasing rice can be reduced. The above-mentioned allocation amount seems to be small for Chinese people who do not like to use side dishes. Therefore, Chinese workers engaged in productive labor will be given special allocations depending on the importance of the factory to which they belong. The standards for the importance of factories are roughly military-managed factories, military-commissioned factories, public utilities, and factories related to the Municipal Council as important factories, and others as non-important factories.

### Red Cross Acts as Agent for Overseas Mail - To Be Sealed and Sent Soon - Exact Date Not Yet Announced, Hundreds of Letters Received

As of now, the association has received hundreds of such letters, and the first batch will be sent out at the end of the month.

### Boiler Manufacturers' Annual Registration - Boiler Installation Also Subject to Supervision

The Municipal Council announced yesterday that in order to ensure public safety and to ensure that the manufacture and repair of boilers in the local area meet reasonable standards, the Bureau is now handling the registration of local boiler manufacturers.

All (A) boilers or steam pressure machines manufactured in the factory, and (B) all defects that appear to endanger the safety of the factory and are repaired by the factory shall be handled by an approved engineer. 3. The applicant must submit a report detailing all details of the boilers to be manufactured each month to the Bureau's Industrial and Social Affairs Department. 4. The applicant shall not install boilers in any location unless in compliance with the rules established by the Bureau and under the supervision of an approved engineer. After registration, the Bureau will issue a registration certificate. The registered boiler manufacturer shall be allowed to publish advertisements with the qualification that it has been registered by the Bureau.

The northern end of Yuemingyuan Road, also facing Suzhou Road, has also been blocked off by the Police Department in the same way. However, the southern end of the road and the cross streets can still be entered and exited as usual, with unobstructed passage.

### Emergency Epidemic Hospital - Free Injections Starting Today

The Second Hospital of the Shanghai Emergency Epidemic Hospital on Daxilu Road, due to the gradual warming of the weather and the possibility of epidemics, is scheduled to provide free vaccinations starting today. Other outpatient and inpatient services are still completely free as usual. All sectors recognize the hospital's serious service and benefit many poor and sick people, so many people have been automatically donating to the hospital in recent days.

### After the Rice Shop Manager Was Arrested - Family Suffered from Fraud

Hua Xiangmei, the manager of Tongfeng Rice Shop on Lafayette Road in the French Concession, was arrested on the 5th of this month for gathering more than a hundred colleagues in Gujiazhai French Park to hold a meeting to discuss curbing the black market for rice. Gui Baoquan, the Chinese Inspector-General of the French Police Department, learned of this, and led the Tongban detective Dai Rongji and other detectives to rush to the scene and arrest all the people, taking them to the police station for investigation. All the details were reported in the newspaper. Unexpectedly, rogue Yangzhou man Zhu Degui (51 years old, residing at No. 128, Caishi Road) and Gao Songting (46 years old, residing at No. 8, Tongrenfang, Luzhou Road) often smoked in a certain opium den on Lafayette Road. On the afternoon of the day Hua Xiangmei was arrested, after learning the previous details, Zhu and others came up with a wild idea and went to Hua Yiqi's Yuan Rice Shop at No. 218 Lafayette Road (Hua Xiangmei's brother) and falsely claimed that they were friends with detective Dai Rongji, and that they needed to pay more than a thousand yuan in "movement fees" to release Hua, otherwise he would be sent to the court for investigation. At that time, Hua Yiqi was terrified when he heard this and agreed to give 200 yuan as a reward. He delivered the money to Zhu and others as requested. Unexpectedly, the police station released Hua Xiangmei the next day, so Hua Yiqi did not suspect anything until recently, when detective Dai Rongji found out that Zhu and Gao should not have been swindling under false pretenses. He arrested Zhu and Gao at the Chengyuli opium den on Lafayette Road the day before yesterday, took them to the police station, and they confessed to the fraud. They are being held in custody for investigation.

### Large Quantity of Cloth Stolen from Warehouse on the Edge of the French Concession

The Yutai Silk and Cloth Shop at No. 137 Lanwei Road in the French Concession is opened by Ningbo native Liu Guzhen. After August 13th, because the front was the border between China and France and could not operate, the shop was moved to No. 131 Seymour Road, and the original site was converted into a warehouse. The door was locked and no one was sent to guard it. Unexpectedly, Danyang thief Chen Awu (nicknamed Little Carpenter) colluded with his accomplices Wu Awei, Cai Atang, and five others, digging a hole from the adjacent Chaozhou Cemetery and stealing cloth and woodenware worth more than 20,000 yuan, which they divided and spent. Recently, the victim discovered the theft and reported it to the French Police Station. The detectives arrested Chen and Wu the day before yesterday, recovered the stolen goods, and took them to the police station for detention for investigation.

### Apprentice Sets Fire Out of Resentment

Qu Bingxiang, a local apprentice at the Song Bangji Machine Factory at No. 5, Lane 280, Meibaige Road, is 20 years old. Because he did not work well, he was often reprimanded by his factory owner Song Yaozhang. He harbored resentment and set fire to the factory with oily cloth around 12:00 midnight on the 24th of this month while everyone was asleep, hoping to commit arson. His methods were extremely vicious. Fortunately, the fire was not fierce, only the wooden fence on the wall was charred, and there was no disaster. At dawn, another apprentice, Ni Haofeng, caught sight of it and reported it to the factory owner Song Yaozhang, who reported it to the Xinzha Police Station. Detective Ruan Yao went to investigate and arrested Qu Bingxiang and took him to the police station for custody and verification.

### Struggling for Survival (3) The Jewish Street Market - Determination, Perseverance, Alertness, and Adventure are Their Unique Characteristics

When these Jews first wandered to Shanghai, most of the young women, who generally had no vocational training, were employed as waitresses in bars in Hongkou. They would have encountered a comfortable life in Germany, and some might have even been ladies from noble families, daughters of wealthy families; but once they were reduced to refugees, they had to take on this humble work. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, the bars in Hongkou and other places were closed down en masse due to the situation, and they had to change careers and become door-to-door saleswomen. For the sake of life, they were not ashamed, and like the men, they found a way out in the professional circle.

Adapting to the Environment and Fighting to the End

Some Jews did not have such a hard life. They were employees in offices or formal firms. But in general, no matter what the form of occupation, these Jews were able to show their unique style and adapt to such a new environment.

But in Hongkou, there were still many Jews who could not find jobs. Dozens of them or several families lived together in a small room, with flimsy bunk beds, insufficient sunlight, and shabby furnishings. Each person was given a living allowance of 6.5 cents and coarse food by the Jewish Refugee Committee every day. Everything was pain, suffering, humiliation, and the most difficult and darkest stage of life's journey. But they still lived bravely.

No matter how heavy the pressure is, no matter how bad the environment is, no one should give up the right to survive, and no one should stop the battle of life. This is not only the quality shown by the Jews, but also a strong challenge that anyone should accept. (The End)

### Qianghua Football Team's Second Game - Today's Match Against Hequn - Lost 3-1 to Zhoutang Yesterday

The Qianghua Football Team's expedition to Shanghai and Jiading played its first match against Zhoutang yesterday. At 5:30 PM yesterday, at the Guangxia Stadium, because no tickets were sold, the audience reached as many as three or four thousand people. The Zhoutang team relied on its average talent and geographical advantage to defeat Qianghua 3-1. It is scheduled to play against the Hequn team at the Donghua Stadium on Bixun Road at 5:30 PM today. Qianghua's match yesterday was due to the small venue, where the heroes had no place to use their talents, and also because the main player Ruan Longfei did not play. Today's match against Hequn will definitely be as exciting as yesterday's match. The Donghua Stadium can accommodate more fans.

### European Great Director Gao Tianlun Wanders Thousands of Miles to Shanghai; Discovers and Promotes Enchanting Star Marlene Dietrich; Single-Handedly Manages Puppet Troupe in Half a Year

Film-loving readers, when mentioning Marlene Dietrich, the lead actress in "Dishonored Lady" (Degtry Rideg Again) and "Seven Sinners," two films that were shown in Shanghai not long ago, probably no one will forget how seductive this enchanting star's eyes were, and the indescribable attraction unique to women, her "charm." Truly blessed with natural beauty, Marlene is undeniably worthy of the title.

This female star, who has enjoyed a prominent reputation on the silver screen for twenty years, could hardly have imagined that the first director to recognize her talent, seventeen years ago in a Viennese film studio, the person who first noticed her charming eyes, is now wandering in Shanghai, having become the Geppetto who runs the toy shop in "Pinocchio." Artur Gottlein, the originator of Shanghai's Western puppet show, is Marlene Dietrich's first director. He mined a diamond from the sand, and after nearly twenty years of polishing, it radiates brilliance and is worth a fortune; while he himself, after dabbling in the European film industry for half his life and being able to cite a dozen or so European and American film industry giants as references, has now ended up in a small pavilion-style room, "directing" a row of "wooden heads" about eighteen inches tall.

The Great Director in a Small Building

It was a rainy day when I found Gao Tianlun's residence on Avenue Joffre. Downstairs, along the street, was a shop selling "antique" used goods, a costume designer lived on the third floor, but he lived a very simple life in a small room on the second floor.

Two long sofas, a small round table, a few chairs, a writing desk, and a pile of books – upon entering the room, everything inside was immediately visible; in addition, a few scattered pieces of porcelain on the chest of drawers, photographs, and a pot of flowers placed by the window were the most moving decorations in the room. The house was new, and the light was very good, but in contrast, it made the owner seem all the more weathered and experienced in suffering.

We didn't engage in much formality or small talk. After only five or six sentences, this attentive host had already found several paper packages from the corner of the wall and opened them one by one: these were stills of scenes and protagonists taken in the film studio; these were letters exchanged with major European and American film companies; that was a shooting schedule used by a Manila film company director, and a cast list; that was the script for Huling Pagheha... He was busy handing me the things hidden in the paper packages, while constantly explaining them to me. His face gradually turned a rosy color; his eyes kept moving, his arms waved upward one after another, and his body leaned forward and backward from time to time. In fifteen minutes, Mr. Gao Tianlun, who was almost fifty years old, seemed to have returned to the spirit of twenty years ago, when he was a great film director in Vienna.

"Film is my lifelong career!" he said to me excitedly. He was still looking for photos.

Impressions from Behind the Scenes of a Puppet Show

"Please come to my house one day, and I can talk to you about my experience in the film industry. I have twenty-seven years of experience in film production and editing!"

These words were spoken to me by Gao Tianlun on the second day of directing his puppet show at the Jewish Community Center on Bubbling Well Road, backstage. Therefore, while he was looking for the photo he took with Marlene Dietrich – he was picking it out from a stack of a hundred or so photos – I recalled the expression of Gao Tianlun directing the "wooden heads" that day:

With a cigar in his mouth, wearing only a shirt, in the fifteen-foot-wide backstage area of the puppet show, he was the soul of ten puppets, two puppeteers, and six voice actors.

From moving small props and scenery to directing music and lighting, Gao Tianlun was a non-stop, uncompromising directorial "dictator" backstage. Moreover, he himself was responsible for voicing two lines in the play "The Rich Farmer." He concentrated his attention, directing the puppeteers to adjust the angle of the puppets' "stage steps" and to strengthen the weight of the voice actors' lines or singing; everything escaped his sparkling eyes.

Seventeen years ago, Gao Tianlun's eyes discovered the now-shining star Marlene Dietrich in Vienna.

### More and More Buyers Eagerly Seek Public Bonds, Again Hitting the Daily Limit; Some Private Deals See Prices Raised by One or Two Dollars

The public bond gray market saw even more rampant price increases yesterday. Within five minutes of the market opening, all four types of bonds except Type A hit the daily limit one after another. The order was Type C, Type E, Type B, and Type D. Type D traded twice, while Types B, C, and E traded once. Type A was approaching the limit, but with fewer buyers, it was difficult to realize the demand. The situation was so tense, and the buyers so eager, that they continued to absorb the bonds relentlessly, buying more and more aggressively. This was truly remarkable. The so-called absence of small denominations has now been proven false. After hitting the limit, the market traded Type A and private deals after the limit was reached, raising the price by one or two dollars. On the surface, Yih Tai was the first to aggressively buy in, followed by Xin Ji, who absorbed a huge amount. Tong Xing, on behalf of Ding Kang, reportedly bought in from the financial sector, with bids of 50,000, 100,000, and 100,000, taking decisive action and absorbing the bonds courageously. Ren Feng from the Northern Gang also gathered them aggressively. Da Zhong's absorption was also unwavering, but they bought in after the limit had been reached, raising the price by another one or two dollars. Other firms, such as Hong Xing, Heng Yu, Heng Xing, Run De, Zhong, Cheng Kang, Qian Yi, and Shun Tai, also bought in one after another, mostly new accounts with fresh capital. The sellers were still mostly Tong Li, with Tong Kang, Hu He Ji, Tong Shun, Jiu Feng, and Tong Yuan Lian Yi also supplying, but although the goods were plentiful, they were not enough to satisfy the overwhelming demand. The gray market prices gradually rose, and people's expectations were even higher. The future should not see a reversal, and even if there is a reversal, it will be very temporary. As a result, Type A rose by 3.20 yuan, and the rest all rose by more than 4 yuan, hitting the daily limit. The total trading volume was approximately 4 million yuan. A brief summary is listed below.

### Stock Prices Fell Yesterday

Yesterday, foreign stocks also saw a sharp decline, marking a head-and-shoulders pattern. A total of 100,900 shares were traded.

### Discount Rate Slightly Lower, Sharp Decline in Spot Gold Market

Yesterday, the cash gold spot market suddenly saw a decline, with the price retreating to the 34,000 yuan mark. Market sentiment was weak, mainly due to the head-and-shoulders decline in the discount rate. Currency price fluctuations may temporarily subside. Trading was quite active. In the morning, each bar (ten taels) opened at 36,000 yuan, 300 yuan lower than the previous day's closing price, and 4,000 yuan lower than the afternoon price. Cash shops quoted 26,500 yuan. Securities firms competed with cash shops to sell off their holdings, pushing the price lower. One firm was also keen to supply, seeing a decline of 1,000 yuan to 34,500 yuan. A securities firm then bought in, raising the price to 34,850 yuan at the noon close, 1,450 yuan lower than the previous day's settlement price, and 5,150 yuan lower than the afternoon price. The difference in the first half of the day was 2,000 yuan. In the afternoon, there were sellers at 34,000 yuan.

### All Foreign Currencies Decline

Yesterday, foreign currency market conditions saw the British and American pound fall by 10 yuan, to 690 yuan and 700 yuan respectively. US dollar notes also retreated to 48-49 yuan. Hong Kong notes fell back to 7.34 yuan. Military notes opened at 13.4 yuan in the morning, and then fell steadily, finally closing at 12.5 yuan, 1.5 yuan lower than the previous day. Cash military notes closed at 10.08 yuan.

Yesterday, the discount rate for drafts and bills fell from around 220 yuan per thousand to 150 yuan, a decrease of 110 yuan. The interest rate for overnight loans at the Money Dealers' Association was 1.5 fen. The premium for Central Bank notes rose from 2.9 yuan to 2.45 yuan, a decrease of 6.5 jiao, which was the head-and-shoulders price. Cash was 2.12 yuan.

### Financial Situation Eases; Large Volume of Double Horse Brand Yarn Released

Due to the wild price increases the previous day, the cotton yarn market saw a slight reversal. However, raw materials remained expensive, so the spot market situation remained firm. However, the financial situation eased, and market sentiment calmed down. 42-count Blue Phoenix was 19,100-19,200 yuan, 42-count Bao Guang was 18,300 yuan, 42-count Fairy Peach was 18,000 yuan, 42-count Yang He was 18,600 yuan, 42-count Water Moon was 18,100 yuan, 60-count Color Ball was 27,000 yuan, 32-count Fairy Peach was 17,000 yuan, 20-count Blue Phoenix was 10,600 yuan, 20-count Yue Qin was 9,800 yuan, 20-count Yang He was 10,500 yuan, 20-count Jin Cheng was 10,000 yuan, 20-count Double Horse was 10,100-10,000 yuan, 20-count Heavenly Girl was 9,950 yuan, 20-count Feng Nian was 10,300 yuan, 10-count Jia He was 6,700 yuan, 10-count Red Double Horse was 8,100 yuan, 10-count Red Bao Yi was 8,050 yuan, 10-count Boy Scout was 8,100 yuan, 6-count Bumble Bee was 9,500 yuan. The initial offer price for the 20-count Double Horse factory bill was 10,100 yuan. Subsequently, due to the relaxed financial situation and calm market sentiment, a large volume of profitable long positions were released, causing the market to be flooded and the price to gradually decline to 9,250 yuan. However, the closing price was slightly higher, at 9,500 yuan.

### Cotton Cloth Reverses Sharply

Due to consecutive sharp increases, factory cloth reversed yesterday. The morning market saw a particularly sharp decline, and the market was slightly more stable later. Whether it can stabilize in the future will depend on how the currency system changes. Peach Blossom Nü Shi Lin opened at 550 yuan, and fell straight to 510 yuan, noon closing was 512 yuan, later market was 506 yuan, falling to 502 yuan, evening closing was slightly higher at 508 yuan, a drop of 42 yuan per bolt.

Eastern Cloth. Yesterday, due to the decline in military reserve notes, a portion of the floating long positions were released, and the price fell sharply. The new order for 16-pound Dragon Head fine cloth opened at 430 yuan in the morning, and fell to 414 yuan, noon closing was 418 yuan, afternoon opened at 420 yuan, rose to 426 yuan, and then fell to 412 yuan, a sharp drop of 33 yuan per bolt compared to the previous day.

Colorful Ball closed at 364 yuan, and Four Gentlemen Biji red orders fell to a minimum of 14.45 yuan, with the evening closing at 14.60 yuan, a large drop of 1.55 yuan per yard compared to the previous day.

### Worsted Wool Business Difficult; Summer Goods High-Priced, Sales Reduced

The worsted wool business has been difficult recently. The price of goods is rising endlessly, and it is not easy to replenish them after they are sold. The goods are kicked around and thrown away, and the higher they are kicked, the more scarce the inventory becomes. Looking back at the actual sales of various groups, they have all weakened. The market has lost its formal rules and regulations, and its special, distorted prosperity may not last long. People's ideas of rising and falling are uncertain. If there is inventory, it is difficult to guarantee that the current peak period will not fall permanently.

White Drill, White Zhigong, Feather Yarn Ni, Pang Pi Qu, Paisley, and Fan Er Ding and other summer worsted wools have all weakened in recent days. Standard market prices have not improved due to the high prices of military notes and reserve notes. There is a clear softness and a hidden drop, because the business of making Western suits and the retail cutting business of Chinese clothes in door shops are both worse than in previous years. Actual sales have not started to rise, and hoarding households have turned from buying to selling. All firms in the industry are eager to sell their summer worsted wools. It seems that those who are asking for them all want autumn and winter goods. Therefore, although summer worsted wools are clearly cheaper at 7-8 yuan per yard, it is difficult to attract interest.

### Gold Tide Settles Slightly; Grain Hoarders Release; Broad Beans Plunge by Around 10 Yuan

Sales of beans were quite weak, and the financial storm calmed down slightly, causing sellers to loosen their selling intentions, and prices saw a decline of around 10 yuan. Yesterday, 50 bags of Kai Ping Lake Du beans were sold at a price of 310 yuan, 10 bags of Sang Yuan soybeans at a price of 275 yuan, and 125 bags of Chong Ming red beans at a price of 270-260 yuan for self-delivery and 275 yuan for delivery.

Corn was sluggish yesterday due to sluggish sales and the trend of scattered sellers releasing their holdings, and prices fell by more than 5 yuan. 288 bags of Wuhu corn were sold at a price of 205-200 yuan for delivery, and 140 bags of Chuzhou corn at a price of 195 yuan for delivery.

Hoarders of bean cakes weakened yesterday, and domestic sales were sluggish, causing market sentiment to be quite weak, and prices suddenly fell by as much as 10 yuan. 2,000 pieces of Hankou bean cake were sold at a price of 62-60 yuan, 1,000 pieces of Sheng Ji cake old warehouse order in May at a price of 72-67 yuan, and 1,500 pieces of old warehouse order in June at a price of 72.5-70 yuan, and 500 pieces of old warehouse order in July at a price of 73 yuan, and 500 pieces of new warehouse order in February at a price of 80 yuan, and 500 pieces of new warehouse order in March at a price of 82 yuan, and 4,000 pieces of new warehouse order in April at a price of 89-83 yuan.

Under the release of floating hoarders yesterday, wheat bran prices saw a decline of 5-10 yuan. 500 bags of San Xin small package wheat bran end-of-May warehouse order were sold at a price of 150 yuan, and 250 bags of large package wheat bran at a price of 142-147 yuan.

### Occasional Transactions in Black Iron Billets

The black iron billet market has been fairly active in recent days, mainly because printing plants, mirror factories, machine factories, and billet iron factories have occasionally been absorbing them. It is said that the current inventory in the Shanghai market is not very abundant, and the source of supply has long been cut off, leading to a shortage of circulating goods, which has aroused the idea of hoarding among those who hold the goods. Therefore, the asking price has been frequently raised due to the continuous rise in military reserve notes. Yesterday, 2,000-pound original bundled goods were sold at 15,000-17,000 yuan, depending on the softness or hardness of the thinking of colleagues. Other zinc iron (commonly known as tinplate) market conditions have also been trending upward. Currently, 100-pound 14-inch 20-inch single sheet plates are priced at 1,300 yuan per box, and 200-pound 20-inch 28-inch connected iron is priced at 2,600 yuan per box, and spot goods are extremely scarce.

### Sugar Prices Loosen

Yesterday, the sugar market saw military notes loosen, and in the afternoon, the head-and-shoulders military notes were 12.8-12.4 yuan, so the spot raw white gray market gradually fell by 80-100 yuan, and Dutch raw fell by 110 yuan. At the same time, sugar stocks also loosened, with raw sugar stocks falling from 595 yuan to 525 yuan, then to 550-538 yuan, and red sugar stocks initially at 480 yuan, then at 430 yuan, a decrease of 50 yuan.

### Longan Industry to Sell Cash

Due to the skyrocketing discount rate on head-and-shoulders positions, the price of longan cannot be fixed. Various firms are also considering switching to selling cash to avoid trouble. Yesterday, it was still under discussion and had not yet been decided, but it is likely to be implemented.

### Ningbo Laver Rises by 300 Yuan

Ningbo laver's current sales are turning active, and the financial storm is intensifying, so the price has followed closely. The market price has risen from 5,500 yuan to 5,800 yuan, a rise of 300 yuan. It is said that there is not much inventory in the market, and the source of supply is also scarce, so the trend is firm.

### Walnut Market Slightly Tight

Although walnut prices have loosened recently due to the weather, the market situation has turned stable due to repeated financial changes. Moreover, the price of ordinary goods is still flat, and those who are interested in the long term are quite interested in taking advantage of the low prices, so the asking price has been slightly raised.

### Firewood and Soap Prices Easy to Rise, Difficult to Fall

Daily necessities have been affected by the financial turmoil and prices have continued to rise. Although cigarette prices fell yesterday, daily necessities were not affected in any way. Because the root cause is dry, the price is difficult to fall easily. The asking price for Gu Ben soap is 490 yuan, Bai Xiang Mao soap is 420 yuan, Huang Xiang Mao soap is 380 yuan, Arrow Knife soap is 400 yuan, with few transactions. Phoenix brand matches are 7,000 yuan, Beauty brand is 7,100 yuan, and miscellaneous brands are 6,000 yuan, 200-300 yuan lower than the previous day. Candles remained unchanged, with little buying and selling. The market presented a situation of having prices but no market, and the price remained at the original price. The asking price for White Lee's brand is 190 yuan, and miscellaneous brands are 150 yuan.

### Factory Side Dispaches Goods, Cigarettes Profit-Taking, Great Britain Brand Plummets by 3,000 Yuan

Cigarette market conditions: selling prices rise and fall suddenly, and market sentiment is always tied to financial dynamics, causing the appetite to follow suit. Yesterday, news spread that the factory side was about to dispatch goods, so general profit-takers sought to release their holdings, and market prices suddenly fell. The asking price for Great Britain brand was 13,000 yuan, a sharp drop of 3,000 yuan compared to the previous day, Old Knife brand was 9,500 yuan, Pin Hai brand was 7,000 yuan, Wu Hua brand was 5,900 yuan, and Little Fairy brand was 6,600 yuan. Transactions were sluggish, and prices were all 500-800 yuan lower than the previous day. Sales of Japanese cigarettes remained strong, with prices uniformly 300-400 yuan lower. The asking price for Gold Gun brand was 2,650 yuan, Gold Building brand was 3,300 yuan, Red Rose brand was 2,150 yuan, Quan Lu brand was 3,100 yuan, Compass brand was 2,400 yuan, and the asking price for the domestic cigarette Beauty brand was 5,800 yuan, and Gold Mouse brand was 3,350 yuan.

### Saying Farewell in the Parting Song: Li Shifang

— Yan Qing

Little Mei Lanfang, Li Shifang, will soon stop performing in Shanghai. In the past month, newspapers in Shanghai have given her many good reviews, saying that her appearance is delicate and beautiful, and her singing voice is melodious, reminiscent of Huanhua. Urged by a friend, I went to see her Mei-style performance of "Life and Death Hate." This play is Mei Lanfang's private play, and all Qingyi of the Mei school can perform it. The plot is sad and meaningful, but leaving that aside, let's just talk about her singing and acting:

Shifang's voice is melodious and beautiful, but it is too low, giving people the feeling that there is melody but no clear words. It seems that even though my seat was as close as the fifth row, I still found it difficult to hear clearly, so it is easy to imagine what it was like for the audience in the back rows. This is where she is not as good as Jun Qiu; Jun Qiu's singing can be described as "reaching into the clouds" without any exaggeration. Although sometimes the artifice is still obvious, it can still be heard clearly from a distance, and this is where she surpasses others, which Shifang has not yet reached. When singing slow passages, her lips are too slanted, which is very unaesthetic. Her appearance is a bit too thin, but her captivating eyes have a three-part resemblance to Hui Sheng. Her sleeves move too vigorously, and her style is too excessive, lacking the charm of subtlety. This must be because she lacks practice and contemplation, and she needs to work harder. It must be known that the success or failure of art is due to talent, but it mostly comes from "diligence and hard work," and drama is no exception. Looking at the four great Dan actresses, Mei, Cheng, Xun, and Shang, those who have achieved today's achievements have many supporters, but if they had no real strength, how could they have reached this point? Shifang is a clever person, and I think she will agree with my words.

Ji Yuliang's performance in Shanghai this time was better than last time. His style was better, his voice was stronger, his eyes were more expressive, and his movements were more dramatic, as elegant as Lian Liang. His artistic skills have obviously improved. Although his charm is slightly lacking, he is no longer comparable to Li Shengzao. If he can continue to work hard, he can compete with Guan Shaohua.

### "King of the Acting World" John Barrymore Seriously Ill

— Xin Juan

Since the beginning of American cinema, which actor or actress besides Charlie Chaplin has enjoyed such a high standing that it remains unshakeable over the course of shifting times and trends? It has to be the Barrymore brothers.

The Barrymore family can be described as a "family of actors". The three brothers—Lionel, John, and Ethel—were once famous stage actors. Especially John, who shone even more brightly on both stage and screen. Born in Philadelphia on February 15, 1882, he devoted himself to dramatic arts at the age of twenty-one and enjoyed great fame. Soon after, he went to the film industry and starred in many blockbusters. He was the central figure in the silent film era. Later, he returned to the stage for a period of time. In 1925, he went back to Hollywood, and he had a second career, retaining his high reputation up to the present. (Image attached).

John was a genius actor who excelled in comedies, detective stories and heroic characters. He and Lionel cooperated in many films. At his peak, he overshadowed even Clark Gable and Greta Garbo. He played the uninhibited character Kosh in "Rasputin and the Empress" with great humor and lightness. This is an expression people remember forever. His works have left a lasting impression on our minds including "The Sea Beast", "General Crack", "Grand Hotel", "Rasputin and the Empress", "Bill of Divorcement", "A Bill of Divorcement", "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde", "Arsène Lupin", "State's Attorney", and so on.

John was a man of great ambition. He married three times: his first wife was Katharine Harris, his second wife was Michael Strange, and his third wife was Dolores Costello. He separated from them one after another. John's new work is "Playmates" with Robbie Vann. He is now sixty years old.

According to a Havas report from Hollywood on the 22nd, John is seriously ill. The news has caused concern among his fans. We hope that he will get well soon!

### Revival of the Xian Ni Kun Opera Troupe

— Jian Fan

The Xian Ni Kun Opera Troupe of Jiangnan, the only remaining troupe of its kind, has been performing sporadically due to the dispersal of its members and the difficulty in securing a performance venue. At the end of last year, they performed famous dramas for three days at the Dongfang No. 2 Recreation Ground, attracting opera enthusiasts like ducks to water, and it is still praised and enjoyed as a great pleasure! It is recently learned that only ten of the troupe's actors remain in Shanghai, including the senior actor Chuán Jiàn, who also excels in the roles of older male characters and end roles. His acting and expressions are unique! Although his voice is hoarse, his singing and recitation are calm, powerful, and deeply resonant, not aiming for the style of the Peking Opera's Qilin Tong. In addition to teaching opera privately, he and the clown Huá Chuán Hào both serve as professors in the Kun Opera Department of the Shanghai Drama School. Chuán Hào's acting is neither lukewarm nor overly enthusiastic; his speech is witty and delightful! His portrayal of Wu Dalang's short steps and Shi Qian stealing chickens are his signature masterpieces. The female role Chu Zhū Chuán Míng, the supporting female role Zhāng Chuán Fāng, and the young male role Zhōu Chuán Yīng are all incredibly talented in their respective roles! In particular, their joint performance of "The Peony Pavilion: The Garden Stroll and Dream Interrupted" is elegant and graceful, complementing each other perfectly! The supporting role Wáng Chuán Sōng excels in performing plays such as "Dog Hole," "Looking in the Mirror," "Wandering in the Palace," "Borrowing Boots," "Borrowing Tea," "Capture Alive," and "Jiaoxiao Ji Writing a Statement." His meticulous depiction and subtle portrayal captivate the audience. Since joining the Guofeng Society's Suzhou Opera Troupe led by Zhū Guóliáng, he still participates in Kun Opera performances, never forgetting his roots. Guān Shēng Zhào Chuán Jùn has a naturally beautiful voice, reaching the clouds with his high notes! Watching him perform solo in "Resigning from the Court," "Su Kui," "Hearing the Bells," "Welcoming the Cry," and his duet with Chuán Míng in "Qiao Vinegar," "Small Banquet," and "Selling Horses Writing a Statement," every detail is perfect, and the sound is unparalleled! He also excels in plays such as "Seeing Each Other," "Corridor Meeting," and "Library." It is a pity that the troupe currently lacks a suitable elderly female role to pair with him, preventing the performance of the play "Seeing Mother." "Corridor Meeting" and "Library" have also not been performed for a long time since Shěn Chuán Zhǐ left Shanghai. The artistry of the leading female role Wáng Chuán Qú is inferior to Chuán Zhǐ. Fortunately, her hoarse voice has recovered, and her performance in "Dreaming Foolishly," "Recognizing Her Son," "Selling Herself," and "Describing Farewell" is delicate, appropriate, and follows the established rules. The painted-face role Shào Chuán Yōng and the young female role Fāng Chuán Yún can each showcase their strengths, performing perfectly. During their hiatus from performing, most of them relied on teaching opera to make a living, with Chuán Fāng, Chuán Jiàn, and Chuán Míng being hired the most. In recent years, opera enthusiasts in Shanghai have not had the elegant leisure to appear on stage, resulting in few opportunities to fill roles in the troupe; moreover, due to incomplete casting and the difficulty of gathering everyone, they have been unable to accept grand private engagements. As a result, their income is meager, their lives are simple and difficult, and their days are becoming increasingly hard! It is recently heard that a certain drama troupe will perform at the Jiuxing Grand Theater; the Sunday morning slot will be sublet to the Xian Ni Troupe. Every Sunday morning, they will perform Kun Opera for two hours. Once they receive the license, it can be implemented. The dying melody of "Rainbow Skirt Feather Jacket" can be heard again, which is truly good news for Kun Opera lovers!

### Casual Talks on Storytelling

— Piao Feng (Wafting Wind)

Although storytelling is a minor art, it has elements that make people savor it. For example, in the section "Chen Cuie Severely Reprimands Fang Qing" in the Pearl Tower sung by Shen and Xue, there are the lines: "The illustrious Henan State Minister, the dignified grandson of the former Prime Minister." According to the original lines of Ma Rufei, the founder of the Pearl Tower storytelling, it was "Illustrious son of a celestial official." Perhaps because the three characters "son of a celestial official" are not sonorous enough, it was changed to "State Minister Fang," but the two characters "State Minister" are repetitive with "Prime Minister," so it also feels inappropriate. Some people say that "son of a celestial official" can be changed to "fine young gentleman," which sounds louder, but the tones are not harmonious. Moreover, using "illustrious" to describe "fine young gentleman" is too much. From this, we can see the difficulty of obtaining good lines. However, I believe that the urgent task of the current storytelling community should be to pay attention to the writing of popular pieces. The content should strive to conform to real life, and there is no need to keep singing about "wind, flowers, snow, and moon." As for the melody, there is no need to study the tones. There are many inappropriate and overly low-level aspects in old storytelling that also need to be deleted.

The number of rising stars in the storytelling community is already quite large, and there are many who are "better than their predecessors." Regarding technical aspects, they certainly need further learning, but they cannot neglect the cultivation of personality and self-training. If they do so, then whether "storytelling and singing" or "giving lectures," singing opening passages, making jokes, and knowing what to choose, they will undoubtedly be able to occupy a place on the future stage.

### Art Scene

— Xin Juan (Heart Cuckoo)

Sun Jinglu, who is carving out a new path, said that after leaving the China Travel Troupe, she decided to organize the China Drama Theater with Zhang Yijun and perform at the Carlton Theater. It is scheduled for one month, from June 1st to June 30th. The first play was originally "Amazing Separation" written by Gu Zhongyi, but due to various reasons, it was decided to change it to Cao Yu's "Peking Man," inviting Hong Shen to direct and also inviting Qiu Quan from the Shanghai Art Theater to join the collaboration. It is heard that Qiu Quan's monthly salary is 700 yuan, setting the highest record for actors' salaries in the drama world, not allowing Shi Hui, who took 601 yuan in Longmen, to monopolize the stage.

Qiu Xia and Li Hong are also starring in "Roses Bloom Everywhere," and costumes are already being made. Filming will begin soon.

The Shanghai Conservatory of Music is scheduled to hold a concert at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA on Friday, the 29th of this month, at 5:30 PM. The highest ticket price is five yuan.

It is heard that the China Travel Troupe has invited Shangguan Yunzhu to join, filling the gap left by Sun Jinglu. It is unknown whether it will become a reality.

The four first-run cinemas, including Da Guangming, will re-release old films such as "Rebecca" and "The Private Life of Henry VIII" in the near future.

The "Plum Blossom Dream" of Shanghai Art Theater will be performed until the end of this month, and Sun Jinglu will take over afterwards, and the Shanghai Art Theater will temporarily rest.

Recreational Miscellany

### Da Lian Xiang (Performing Linked Xiang Dance)

— Ze Fu

Da Yun Xiang is a kind of double-簧 style drama in which the singer sings and the performer performs independently. It is said to have originated in the Liao and Jin dynasties and was extremely popular until the Qing dynasty. Mao Qiling once imitated two kinds: one is called "Selling Dowry Lian Xiang," and the other is called "Releasing Stolen Goods Lian Xiang." It is called Lian Xiang because it generally involves four dancers who perform while dancing, hence the name. There are also musical instruments when performing. First, several songs are played, and then the narrative is presented. The narrative is in a descriptive style, while the singing is in a first-person style, so it is slightly different from pure drama structure. The performers are generally two people, a man and a woman, who perform on stage, and another person sings for them. For example, when singing "Paying Respects to the Bodhisattva," the performers make a bowing gesture. However, since the Xianfeng and Tongzhi periods, this drama has been greatly reformed. More than two people perform at a time, and the performers themselves sing and speak. The content mainly focuses on making jokes and teasing, which is quite similar to Da Huagu, so it is also commonly called Huagu Lian Xiang. It is often found in the Northern Ten Unoccupied (Shi Bu Xian) troupes. The musical instruments only include gongs and drums. The performers dress as two ugly men and ugly women, and two as elegant young men and beautiful women. First, the two ugly characters dance and twirl on stage, then each leads a Dan (female role), and then they twirl, dance, sing, and each time a section is sung, it is accompanied by gongs and drums, so it is very different from the previous Lian Xiang.

### Comedian Leaps Over the Dragon Gate and Has Good Luck

— Jian Xin

Jiang Xiaoxiao, known for his funny and humorous performances, has performed in comedic plays such as "How Absurd," "Foreign Girl," and "Blind Man Borrowing an Umbrella" at the Longmen Theater. Each play is full of laughter, so the performances are very popular. Especially the comedy "Blind Man Borrowing an Umbrella" was performed consecutively for 34 shows, with every show being full. In that play, Jiang Xiaoxiao played two roles, showing his great talent, and he spoke with a Shaoxing accent so authentically that he sounded like a true native of Shaoxing. He saw that Longmen's business was booming day by day and was of course very happy, but because the venue was too small to accommodate a large audience, in order to develop his business, he had already moved to perform at the Empire Theater. His first hit was his famous masterpiece "Burning Tofu Shop," which was performed for half a month, filling the theater every day. It is truly said that he "leapt over the Dragon Gate and had good luck," because his ability to make people laugh lies in "every word and every sentence being humorous and expressive, and every move and every gesture being naturally funny." This is beyond the reach of ordinary comedians. As for his second hit: it is the currently performing "Zhu Zhishan Making a Scene in the Ming Lun Hall." Jiang Xiaoxiao's Zhu Zhishan and Bao Lele's Xu Zijian complement each other perfectly, like the peony and green leaves.

### Riding the Storm Together

(V) Giving as Repaid

Cui Zhen smiled and said, "This is the custom in the countryside. Miss Chen and Cheng Di will definitely say it's superstition, but I think it doesn't hurt to be superstitious once in a while. This pile of firewood is called 'Prosperous Gate.' People returning from a funeral walk through the Prosperous Gate, either stepping over it or touching it with their hands, to ward off disasters and bring blessings." Guo Fang said, "Sister Cui Zhen is knowledgeable and experienced in the countryside. I can only be a student following you." Cui Zhen said, "Miss Chen always says things that I can't bear. I can't lie down anymore, I'm afraid they'll come back." Cui Zhen was already hanging her legs down from the bed, when she suddenly seemed ashamed of something and fell back onto the bed. Guo Fang hurried to support her and said, "Is your headache back? I told you not to rush, why are you rushing? You can't force yourself when you're sick. If your clothes are wrinkled, just let them be wrinkled, I'll cover you with the quilt." Cui Zhen shook her hand and said, "No, I was thinking about them coming back from the funeral, and I don't know if my cousin is still there. If she asks for money from my uncle again, Miss Chen, what can I give her?" Guo Fang smiled and said, "Cui Zhen, is that what you're worried about? I'm here." Not only did she comfort Cui Zhen with words, but she also reached into her pocket and took out twenty yuan to put in Cui Zhen's palm.

Seeing Guo Fang giving her money, Cui Zhen blushed and said, "This, I can't take Miss Chen's money. Miss Chen being willing to come here is an honor to the Ye family, how can I make Miss Chen spend money for an unrelated person like me? Miss Chen, you can do whatever you want, I won't take it." The two were pushing the money back and forth, when a distant gunshot was heard, and Guo Fang withdrew her hand, still hiding the money, and said, "They must be coming back from the funeral. Sister Cui Zhen, lie down and listen to me, and forget about that cousin of yours. Otherwise, being a person is too bitter." Guo Fang went outside and found a piece of white paper, writing a few words in walnut-sized characters: "Someone is sick in the inner room, please forgive us for not disturbing." She posted it outside the room where Cui Zhen was sleeping. Then she went to the Shide Hall and looked outside. The so-called Prosperous Gate was on fire, and the funeral procession was returning in a scattered manner. (86)
