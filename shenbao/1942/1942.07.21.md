### US Implements Management of Sailing Ships, Establishes American Shipping Company

Buenos Aires, 17th (Domei News Agency telegram) According to news from Washington, the US government has decided to establish an American Shipping Company as a supplement to the shortage of ships in American waters. The main business of this new company is to manage the requisition, modification, and operation of sailing ships in the Americas.

Vichy, 20th (Reuters telegram) According to the "Navigation and Commerce News," the US investigation into Asian ships was not satisfactory. Due to the lack of US ships, the supply of white paper to Uruguay is causing panic, and the size of the country's newspapers may be reduced again. The United States is unable to charter ships for transporting iron ore from Brazil and Uruguay. Only one ship transported corn from the Paraíba River to California last week, at a price of $27 per ton. The United States is now organizing land transportation in Central America, and the Mexican government has prepared a large amount of railway materials for Washington.

Berlin, 19th (Havas Agency telegram) A wireless broadcast from here tonight claimed that in the past 24 hours, our fleet has sunk six enemy merchant ships in the Gulf of Mexico and the territorial waters near British possessions along the South American coast.

### Battle Underway in the Eastern Section of Al Alamein; Germans Concentrating Attacks on Ruweisat, British Consolidating Positions in the Center

Cairo, 20th (Havas Agency telegram) The British Middle East Command announced this morning that there had been no changes in the British front lines in Egypt yesterday. Since the 4th of this month, the number of Axis prisoners has reached 4,000.

Rome, 20th (Reuters telegram) An Italian military headquarters communiqué stated that attacks by British tank formations on the northern and central routes in Egypt had been repelled.

Somewhere on the Egyptian Border, 19th (Havas Agency telegram) According to news from Cairo, there were only minor engagements on the front lines in the past 24 hours. Most of the fighting is taking place in the Ruweisat area, which controls the eastern section of Al Alamein. It appears that German Commander Rommel is concentrating all his forces to attack this fortress, but the British are defending it staunchly, making it difficult to take lightly. The Axis forces launched an attack on El Alassa on the northern route yesterday, but were repelled by British tanks and artillery. On the central front, the British attempted to consolidate their positions and straighten their lines. Newspaper reports indicate that Australian forces occupied an important position five miles south of El Alassa the day before yesterday, El Mreir, and intended to continue their advance, but were forced to retreat after fierce resistance from the Axis forces. This British offensive appears to be part of their military strategy to establish a protective line for the Nile Delta. On the German side, there also appears to be an attempt to consolidate their positions, so they have been deploying defenses along the entire front for several days. However, the British hold on El Alassa and Ruweisat prevents the Germans from comfortably deploying a strong defensive line. It is widely believed that the Germans will launch an attack soon. Currently, artillery battles on the front lines are fierce, and troop movements are frequent. Low pressure and sandstorms are not enough to stop their activities. Although the air force is hindered by wind and sand and cannot mobilize extensively, German aircraft are still bombing British transport routes, and British aircraft are also bombing Tobruk and Mersa Matruh. According to British sources, a ship in Tobruk harbor was hit and sunk, and several fires broke out in Mersa Matruh harbor.

Berlin, 19th (Havas Agency telegram) Military sources: In the past week, fierce battles have continued on the Al Alamein front in Egypt. The British lines, stretching approximately forty miles from a certain point in the east to the Qattara Depression, are now in critical condition. According to Egyptian newspapers, Egypt's fate depends on the current campaign, so the British have taken various steps to suppress anti-British activities. When the Axis forces arrived at the Al Alamein front, they found a large number of enemy troops gathered, and all the fortifications had been built several months ago. The British troops stationed there were troops from India, Australia, South Africa, and other places. On the night of the 14th of this month, the enemy launched an attack with infantry and tank formations, attempting to break through our central line of defense, but they were repelled by the German and Italian allied forces, with 1,200 British soldiers captured and several tanks destroyed. On July 16, our army launched a counterattack, and the British army retreated eastward again. British forces north of Al Alamein launched an attack on our forces that morning. The enemy first bombarded with artillery, and then attacked our lines with tanks and mechanized units along the coastal road, but they were also repelled by the German army, with eight tanks destroyed. On July 17, South African British forces launched another attack on our forces, but were again repelled, with many tanks destroyed and 500 South African soldiers captured.

### German and British Aircraft Launch Air Raids Against Each Other

### Roosevelt is Drafting a Plan to Unify Command of the Army and Navy; Leahy to Hold a Key Position in the New Agency, But His Authority Will Not Exceed That of the Deputy Commander-in-Chief

Washington, 19th (Havas Agency telegram) According to the Washington Post, President Roosevelt and his advisors are drafting a plan to unify the command of the Army and Navy. Former US Ambassador to France, Admiral Leahy, is rumored to hold a key position in this new agency. Admiral Leahy is not only a capable diplomat, but also an outstanding naval talent. Before serving as ambassador to France, he served as Chief of Naval Operations. It is said that he will be ordered to coordinate the activities of the US Army, Navy, and Air Force in various theaters of war around the world, roughly as the President's "Military Assistant." According to the US Constitution, the President is the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, and Leahy will assist him in the future. However, Leahy's future authority will not exceed that of the Deputy Commander-in-Chief. His task will be limited to maintaining liaison between the President and the Supreme Command.

Lisbon, 20th (Reuters telegram) According to news from Washington, President Roosevelt has drafted a plan to establish a Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy, and it is likely that former Ambassador to France, Admiral Leahy, will hold this position, reporting directly to the President.

### US Senator Tydings Delivers Broadcast Speech

Baltimore, 19th (Havas Agency telegram) US Democratic Senator Tydings delivered a broadcast speech today stating that British and American generals both support opening a second front in Europe. However, if such a large-scale war is launched without adequate support, it would be a grave mistake, and those responsible should bear the blame. According to the highest military authorities, if the second front cannot be sustained, Britain and the United States will once again face the humiliation of the "Dunkirk evacuation." If so, the situation of the Allied countries will be worse than it is now. It will take time to rest and replenish troops and replenish military equipment. On the other hand, Germany will be able to do what it wants even more than before. However, I am not saying that this risky action is not worth considering, but it must be done with considerable confidence.

### Indian Congress Party Committee to Move to Bombay

Bangkok, 20th (Reuters telegram) According to sources here, the central organization of the Indian Congress Party is scheduled to move from Allahabad to Bombay on August 2. The Congress Party Committee is scheduled to meet there on August 7.

Lisbon, 20th (Central News Agency telegram) The All-India National Congress Executive Committee recently passed a resolution demanding the withdrawal of British forces from India. The British government is using all means to create an atmosphere of opposition. According to a New Delhi dispatch, the new Indian Defense Minister, Khan, stated on the 19th that the British opposed the Congress Party launching a non-cooperation movement, saying, "Gandhi's request for British labor to withdraw from the movement is clearly intended to establish the right of Hinduism to dominate India. The non-cooperation movement he advocates is a form of intimidation against Britain." It is acknowledged that the Congress Party has contributed greatly to the political awakening of India, and the passage of this resolution is truly incomprehensible. Indian workers, Muslims, communists, and political groups such as the Indian Congress, the Free League, etc., are unlikely to support the resolution.

### Britain Expresses Apology to Sweden

Germany has announced that the Axis powers have sunk 19,000,000 tons of merchant ships. The British government has also admitted that more ships are being sunk than are being built. However, experts believe that new ships built by August next year will be sufficient to compensate for the ships sunk. Britain and the United States have reached an understanding regarding shipbuilding plans, and the construction of merchant ships will be given priority, while the construction of warships will only be secondary, because resolving the transportation problem is of decisive importance to the war situation.

### The War Situation on the Southern Front of the Soviet Union: Approaching the Gate to the Caucasus, German Troops in Voronezh Take a Defensive Stance

German Headquarters, 20th (Haidao News Agency Electricity) - Today's General Military Communiqué states that our troops on the southern route of Eastern Europe, as soon as the heavy rain ceases, will exert their full force to pursue the Soviet troops retreating southeast. Our aircraft routed the enemy east of Rostov, sweeping away vital transportation routes for enemy supplies in the Don River basin. Yesterday, strong enemy forces again attacked the bridgehead fortress of Voronezh, engaging in fierce fighting for a long time but failing to break through. Our aircraft participated in the battle, destroying 36 out of 60 enemy tanks. The railways in the Moscow area are being bombed by German aircraft day and night. The enemy forces south of Lake Ilmen failed in their offensive; an enemy unit was annihilated and 19 tanks destroyed. The port of Murmansk was bombed, with fires breaking out in several shipyards and oil depots. Our aircraft engaged enemy aircraft in Kola Bay, shooting down 17 enemy planes.

Moscow, 20th (Havas News Agency Electricity) - The Soviet Information Bureau announced this morning that fierce fighting is still taking place in the Voronezh area, where German troops have taken a defensive stance. Our troops have retaken several locations.

Stockholm, Sweden, 19th (Havas News Agency Electricity) - According to an announcement by the Moscow Radio Station, the Red Army General Headquarters has ordered the abandonment of Voroshilovgrad. For the past 24 hours, the Red Army has been confronting the enemy in the Voronezh area and south of Millerovo. As for other areas of the front line, there have been no major developments.

Lisbon, 19th (Alliance News Agency Electricity) - News from Moscow states that hundreds of German tanks are currently targeting Rostov, launching a fierce attack southward. The battle for Rostov, a tank battle between German and Soviet forces, is unprecedented in scope. Since the Soviet army recaptured Rostov from the German army last year, it has made every effort to fortify the city. The Soviet army is now attempting to defend the city to the death, and it is expected that the Soviet army will put up considerable resistance in the city. It is now reported that fresh German troops are arriving continuously in the lower reaches of the Don River, and a portion of them has crossed the Don River and is advancing eastward towards Rostov.

Somewhere on the Ukrainian border, 19th (Havas News Agency Electricity) - According to military sources, the Soviet southern front war yesterday approached the gate to the Caucasus. German and Romanian troops, after breaking through the Soviet defenses east of Rostov, continued to advance last night, advancing approximately eight to ten miles in a single day. German forces also used a large number of paratroopers to land behind Red Army lines. Rostov is now within range of German heavy artillery fire, and German aircraft are constantly bombing the city. Transportation in the city is inconvenient, and it is feared that the Red Army will not be able to hold it for long. In addition, the Kalitova River has also been controlled by the German army, and transportation lines to the northeast of the city have been cut off. Even if the Red Army wants to retreat, the only way is to cross the Don River. As for railway transportation, Rostov currently only has a route through Salsk to Stalingrad. German troops have arrived in the suburbs of Kamensk-Shakhtinsky, north of Rostov, and the two armies are engaged in fierce fighting. It is rumored that German motorized units have broken into the city, but this has not yet been confirmed. There is also fierce fighting in the area of ​​Radufsk east of Rostov, where German troops intend to go directly to Novocherkassk. From the current situation, the Red Army's resistance on the Donets River and Don River has weakened in the past five days. The counteroffensive on the line from Stalingrad to Astrakhan has not yet succeeded. In the Astrakhan area, the large tank battle is still ongoing, but it has shifted to the east, which proves that the Red Army is already showing signs of being unable to hold on. According to military observers, after the German army captures Rostov, it will go south to seize the Caucasus. In view of the recent German military deployments in the Kerch Peninsula, this observation is all the more credible. However, according to news from Berlin, the large-scale German offensive has not yet been launched. The current battle situation is still of a preparatory nature, with the aim of occupying strongholds in preparation for a decisive battle. After Rostov and Stalingrad fall, the communication between the Soviet headquarters and the Caucasus will be completely cut off. At that time, the Red Army in central and northern Soviet Union will have difficulty obtaining gasoline supplies. Berlin believes that it will be difficult for the Soviet authorities to transport large amounts of gasoline through the Caspian Sea and Saratov. However, the Soviet army has not been completely defeated. According to the authorities, there is enough gasoline outside the Caucasus to last for two or three months of combat. However, this kind of optimistic view should not be lightly believed.

German Military Department Releases War Situation

Berlin, 20th (Haidao News Agency Electricity) - According to the German High Command, in the central sector of the Eastern Front, several hundred Soviet troops continued to be captured in the Kiev area, and the mopping-up operation there is about to end. When German aircraft conducted armed reconnaissance in the area, they again attacked Soviet trains southeast of Moscow and destroyed many sections of the railway tracks with heavy bombs. On July 17, the German artillery bombarded the Soviet army during its offensive, first with heavy artillery bombardment, and then infantry, aircraft, and tanks launched a fierce attack. In this battle, 19 Soviet tanks were destroyed or captured. The German Air Force also participated in the battle and was very effective. On Saturday, German dive bombers raided the port of Losista in Kola Bay in the Murmansk region, dropping bombs on the port's ship repair yards and dock facilities, causing several fires. Another German bomber squadron raided the power plant in Momyhi, shooting down four Soviet aircraft.

Berlin, 20th (Haidao News Agency Electricity) - According to the German High Command, German troops advanced towards the lower reaches of the Don River and continued to pursue the defeated Soviet troops in the Voroshilovgrad area. German aircraft assisted in the battle and were also very effective. The railway southeast of Rostov was also heavily bombed, and three trains transporting troops and war materials were destroyed. Ten other trains were also hit, and a station and a fuel depot were also bombed. German aircraft attacked airfields in and around Rostov, destroying four enemy aircraft. The German-Hungarian allied forces advanced towards the Don River. The Soviet counterattack has been defeated, and 121 tanks have been destroyed, with another 14 captured by the German-Hungarian allied forces. Soviet infantry and tank units in the Voronezh area have repeatedly attacked but have also been repulsed. German aircraft in the area have achieved considerable results, with 14 freight cars destroyed inside the station.

Red Army Breaks Through Encirclement Line

Stockholm, Sweden, 20th (Havas News Agency Electricity) - For the past 24 hours, the German offensive against Rostov and Stalingrad has not diminished in intensity. According to the Red Star newspaper, the German army has also seized a stronghold in the Millerovo area, enough to threaten the entire front line of the southern Red Army. At present, the battle situation between the Donets River and the Don River is like a race, that is, the large Red Army corps is retreating towards Stalingrad, and the German army is trying to cut off its path. According to Moscow's announcement, the Red Army's retreat is orderly, and the large corps has escaped the encirclement. Berlin also admitted yesterday that the southern Red Army's defense line is quite elastic, implying that the encirclement operation has not been completed and that last year's annihilation battle has not been repeated today. This is something that the German authorities did not expect. However, the German authorities still intend to find ways to attack it, so that it has no opportunity to reorganize and is unable to effectively resist the next German offensive. As for whether the Red Army still intends to defend Rostov or intends to concentrate its forces to hold the new defense line on the Don River and the Caucasus, in other words, the new defense line on the Don River and the Krasnodar-Stalingrad railway, there are still no detailed reports to support this. This line is currently the only transportation line between the central and southern Soviet Union, and it should be defended at all costs. According to news from Moscow, a large number of fresh troops from the Caucasus and Volga regions, commanded by General Lev Lvovich, have arrived at the front line, preparing to assist General Timoshenko's troops in fighting a decisive battle with the German army. The defense of this railway is greatly aided by the effective resistance in the Voronezh area. The continuous counterattacks by the Red Army in the area have contained five or six German armored divisions and five or six infantry divisions.

Moscow, 20th (Havas News Agency Electricity) - The Red Army's official newspaper, Red Daily, recently published an editorial frankly admitting that the Red Army is currently in a critical situation. A warning issued by a reporter stationed in Moscow stated that the German army is still determined to give the Red Army a fatal blow, and this blow will be launched on the southern route. Can it be prevented in time? Can the situation still be reversed to put the German army at a disadvantage? All Soviet newspapers today cautiously answered this question with "yes." In addition, the Truth newspaper published an article today urging the Red Army artillery to do its best to stop the enemy's backbone armored divisions, stating that the Red Army's artillery fire is very fierce, but because it is too scattered, a part of the artillery can not be moved nimbly, and can not be bombed quickly. A large number of German troops are able to concentrate in several places to break through our army's defense lines.

### The Seven Thousand Western Books Brought by Nicholas Trigault at the End of the Ming Dynasty

— Xu Zongze

During the transition from the Ming to the Qing Dynasty, Jesuit priests came to our country. In addition to spreading religion, they introduced Western science, which brought a unique splendor to the academic world of our country. Mr. Liang Qichao said: "The Ming Dynasty used the Eight-legged Essay to select scholars. The general scholars, except for the Complete Book of Human Nature and Principles personally designated by Emperor Yongle, hardly read any books. The academic world itself was as weak as a person with anemia... Matteo Ricci, Michael Ruggieri, Sabatino de Ursis, Niccolò Longobardo, Didace de Pantoja, Johann Schreck, Emmanuel Diaz, Giulio Aleni, and Johann Adam Schall von Bell, etc., entered China one after another from the late Wanli period to the Tianqi and Chongzhen periods. Chinese scholars such as Xu Wending and Li Liang'an interacted with them and had in-depth research on various academic disciplines... Under this new environment, the academic atmosphere naturally changed. Later generations of scholars in the Qing Dynasty were interested in calendar and mathematics and were most fond of talking about practical application of knowledge, probably influenced by Matteo Ricci and Xu Guangqi." (Academic History of China in the Last Three Hundred Years, pages 13, 14) These words are well said.

Although the Western scholars instilled science, their contribution lies in bridging Chinese and Western cultures. However, their in-depth research, that is, the translation of books, should also be mentioned. The translation of books by Western scholars began with Matteo Ricci and Xu Guangqi's translation of Euclid's Elements, and its expanded work began with the priest Nicholas Trigault bringing seven thousand books from Europe.

Nicholas Trigault, P. Nleol. Trigault, whose Chinese name was Si Biao and courtesy name was Du'airen, was born in 1577. He joined the Society of Jesus in 1594. In the autumn of 1610, he arrived in Macau, and the following spring, he arrived in Nanjing. At that time, Niccolò Longobardo, the head of the Jesuit mission in China, believed that as Chinese ecclesiastical affairs gradually developed, it was necessary to send someone to Rome to report to the Superior General of the Society of Jesus on the missionary affairs in China and to request that missionaries be sent to China. Therefore, he ordered Nicholas Trigault to go. In 1612, Nicholas Trigault set off from Nanjing, arrived in Macau, and in the spring of 1613, he set sail. In the winter of 1614, he arrived in Rome, was received in audience by Pope Paul V, presented the ecclesiastical affairs, and requested permission to translate the classics. He also met the Superior General of the Society of Jesus. After finishing his work, he traveled around Europe, taking the opportunity to pay his respects to the authorities of various Catholic countries, detailing the situation of missionary work in China and promoting Chinese culture. In April 1618, he and 22 fellow members set off from Europe. On July 22, 1620, they finally arrived in Macau, bringing back more than 7,000 Western books given by the Pope, beautifully bound, different from Chinese books. At that time, Chinese scholars who believed in religion, such as Xu Guangqi, Li Zhizao, Yang Tingyun, and Wang Zheng, were all overjoyed and eager to translate them one by one so that European science could be fully introduced into our country. From the prefaces to the translated books, one can get a glimpse of the translation movement at that time.

Earlier, after Xu Guangqi was baptized in 1603, he had many exchanges with Western scholars, listened to their opinions, and thought of translating the books brought by the Western scholars (not the books brought back by Nicholas Trigault) with the help of like-minded people. Xu Guangqi's postscript to Matteo Ricci's Twenty-five Words said: "I occasionally asked for several kinds of books translated by him (Matteo Ricci), received them, and finished studying them. The scriptures he brought from his country filled the boxes, but they had not been translated and could not be read. Since coming to the capital, there have been few writings. These Twenty-five Words were completed in the temporary capital. This summer, Chu Xian, Mr. Feng, asked to give them to Li Zao and pass them on to his people, which is what is called one in ten thousand. However, the general meaning can be seen. I further asked him: In the scriptures you brought, the subtle words and profound meanings are as vast as the sea. If we could get a few like-minded people to translate them together, so that everyone could hear the ultimate arguments and obtain their origins, and also steal their remains to benefit the people, that would be a great pleasure for all ages." (Wanli Jia Chen, 1604 AD)

Xu Guangqi had this request for translating books, and Matteo Ricci replied: "Translating the meaning of the scriptures is not yet possible. You can wait." The reason is that the Western scholars came to our country originally to promote the Holy Religion. If they were to make translation their main task, people might misunderstand that they came from afar solely to promote the study of physical forms and would not pay attention to the merits of glorifying the Lord, saving souls, and transcending nature. Therefore, they seemed reluctant. Xu Guangqi also understood this meaning clearly, so his preface to Sabatino de Ursis's Western Water Law said: "In the study of things and the investigation of principles, there is also a kind of study of images and numbers. The study of images and numbers, the greater ones are calendars and musical scales. As for other things with shape and quality, things with degrees and numbers, they all rely on it for use, and everything used is extremely ingenious. I once traveled with Mr. Ricci, and he told me... Until I served in the court, Mr. Ricci had already passed away. I occasionally asked Mr. Sabatino about it. He hesitated for a long time. Observing his mind, he seemed not stingy, but he seemed ashamed. I then privately speculated. Not being stingy means that all gentlemen seek nothing more than benefiting the country and protecting the people when they study and discuss the Way. How much more would they regard this foreign land as rubble. Being ashamed means that they are deeply afraid that this method will be widely spread, and future generations will regard it as Lu Ban and Mo Di, which is not their intention to come ten thousand miles to the east, sacrificing their lives and risking dangers to enlighten the world and benefit all." (Wanli Ren Zi, 1612 AD)

Xu Guangqi first proposed the idea of ​​translating books, and after Nicholas Trigault brought back seven thousand books, this idea flourished again. Li Zhizao's preface to Giulio Aleni's Record of Foreign Lands said, "This Mr. Nicholas actually has more than seven thousand books from that country, intending to contribute them to the Lantai Unicorn Chamber to combine the knowledge of the East and the West. The virtue is enlightened, and the stars shine brightly. At that time, there were foreign books from foreign countries coming nine thousand miles by sea. This is to expand the ancient to the present and make it magnificent. The Holy Lord respects culture. Now, it is time to extensively gather all the talents, divide them into groups, and translate them so as to fully express the wonders of the sea and mountains!" (Tianqi Gui Hai, 1623 AD)

Also, Yang Tingyun's preface to Giulio Aleni's General Western Learning said: "The so-called Six Classics and scriptures are approximately more than seven thousand books, which have already been transported by sea and can be translated. How can this be compared to the few books brought back by Cai Yin and Xuanzang from various countries in India?" (Tianqi Gui Hai, 1623 AD)

Yang Tingyun also said in the "Origin of Harmony" in the Continued Compilation of Substitutions: "Alas, the coming of seven thousand books from the West is not accidental. Whether they are different or the same, we must not be ignorant of the bright intelligence we have received from the heart. It also lies in seeking with a calm heart and accepting with an open mind."

Li Zhizao also said in the preface to Universal Explanation: "The Jing Sect came from Zhenli, and the Scripture Hall translated many classics over the years. Later generations falsely modified them and attributed them to the Buddhist scriptures... Our Ming Dynasty greatly opened the great fortune, and the sages inherited each other. The Taoist culture is spread throughout the world. Famous scholars recommend auspicious signs to the upper country. At that time, Matteo Ricci opened up a journey of ninety thousand miles, and Nicholas Trigault carried more than ten thousand books. The universe reveals its spiritual secrets, and the mountains and rivers shine with their elite. He will present the world to the court, promote the Holy Religion, and civilize it. This is unprecedented in history... And this book (Universal Explanation) only discusses the nature of form, which is still its most superficial aspect. Since I returned to the countryside in Guihai (1623), I have been living with the Rev. Fu Fanji by the lake, cultivating both body and spirit, and studying the origin. Every time I bring up a meaning, I am fortunate to have never had it before, and my heart and eyes are opened. Therefore, I forget the years and the efforts, and I vow to help translate it, because I cannot bear to lose it in my time. But the written language is cut off, and the throat becomes thorny, and I have repeatedly put down the pen due to difficulties. Therefore, I first selected the things that have form and translated the five great things named heaven, earth, water, air, and fire. After this book is completed, there will be many people in China who understand the written language and reason, and they will be able to express what they want to say. Therefore, I will take the book of reasoning and logic and translate it later." (Chongzhen first year, 1628)

From the above, it can be known that the books brought by Nicholas Trigault are approximately more than seven thousand copies, but the types of books have not been clearly stated. They must be related to the Holy Religion, theology, astronomy, geography, calendar calculation, and all sciences. These books were initially kept in Macau and later continuously transported to the mainland, especially in Beijing. After 1623, it seems that the selection and translation had already begun. Li Zhizao's preface to Universal Explanation has hinted at it. And Li Zhizao worked hard to translate books until he was old, and he often asked Western scholars what new books they had and what books could be translated, which shows his fascination with Western learning. In the year before his death, he also compiled and published twenty kinds of Heavenly Learning Letters. Li Zhizao himself explained the purpose of compiling and publishing in the preface: "At that time, there was Matteo Ricci, who came from ninety thousand miles to bring the Tao. He re-enacted this meaning. Up to now, fifty years have passed, and many virtuous people have continued his work. The translation has gradually expanded, showing itself from the laws of physics and logic, subtly reaching the roots of nature and life. The meaning is clear and the purpose is profound, and it is unprecedented. However, the books are scattered in all directions, and scholars always regret that they cannot see them all. Now, I have gathered the old engravings and made two compilations of principles and instruments, with ten kinds in each compilation, to share with like-minded people. This is to give a brief glimpse of the importance of knowledge... Also, in recent years, seven thousand volumes have come from the West and are awaiting instructions. In the future, there will be much to explore and study." (Chongzhen second year, 1629)

Speaking of opening a bureau to translate books, Li Zhizao also said in the Jing Sect Stele Inscription: "Seven thousand volumes of profound and magnificent words have been gathered one after another, opening a bureau to translate them, which is enough to increase the books in the book repository, surpassing the ancients and revealing the future. It is like the Tao is not practiced in vain, so it is still awaiting."

From this, it seems that there was a large-scale organization for the translation of books, and it was planned to request the court to set up a bureau for translation. Therefore, it is said: "Seven thousand volumes from the West are awaiting instructions..." "Opening a bureau for translation..." However, this great plan seems not to have been implemented. However, the religious officials and gentry jointly translated with the Western scholars. However, there were already more than a hundred kinds of translated books at the end of the Ming Dynasty. Wang Zheng's preface to Illustration of Strange Machines said: "Illustration of Strange Machines is a description of the books brought by Western scholars. This is one of the seven thousand copies, and this is only one-tenth of one hundredth of them." (Tianqi seventh year, 1627)

Also, Li Jiugong's preface to Admonition to Cultivate One's Self said: "The Holy teachings have spread widely, and Western scholars have come as guests one after another. They have brought more than seven thousand volumes of books from afar, and more than one hundred kinds have been translated. The various paintings that explain the principles and record events in the teachings have already been made in general." (Chongzhen Ji Mao, 1639)

Also, Tong Guoqi's Stele Inscription on the Reconstruction of the Holy Church in Fuzhou said: "In the Ming Dynasty, in the Xin Chou year of Wanli, the Westerner Matteo Ricci traveled ninety thousand miles by sea, presenting a map of the world and more than seven thousand copies of Western books. The disciples of the same association translated more than one hundred kinds in Beijing, clarifying the true teachings, continuing the lost learning, and the gentlemen and scholars all praised it."

These seven thousand Western books were happily talked about by the scholars who believed in religion at that time, and even those outside the religion and those who were hostile to the religion also talked about them, so the great influence of them can be known.

Huang Zhen, a native of Xiazhang, wrote the book Refuting the Catholic Church, saying: "Today, there are many kinds of Catholic books. Aleni said that more than seven thousand copies have entered China, and there are more than one hundred copies in Zhangzhou now..." (Volume 3 of Breaking Evil Collection)

Also, Xu Dasu wrote the book Assisting the Holy Dynasty in Refuting, saying: "Those foreigners even declare that there are seven thousand volumes of Western books, and the book list alone is enough to fill a shelf, but they have not yet arrived here..." (Volume 5 of Breaking Evil Collection)

As mentioned above, Nicholas Trigault brought back seven thousand books and more than one hundred kinds of translations. However, only a few hundred copies of these seven thousand copies are preserved today, only in the library of the North Church in Xishiku, Beijing, with the emblem of the Society of Jesus and the pontifical coat of arms of Pope Paul V printed on the back. The remaining books have either been lost, buried, or cannot be verified. Alas! Times change, and there are infinite feelings. Here is a brief account to commemorate the enthusiastic cultural career of the former sages.

### Landlords Renting Out Houses Do Not Need to Apply for Licenses; The Third Paragraph of the Municipal Council's Amended Rules for Sublease Licenses Only Requires Clear Disclosure of Partially Rented Areas and Rents

The Municipal Council recently issued Regulation No. 6005, stipulating that landlords (i.e., main landlords) who rent out a portion of their houses to others as residences, provided that they do not open separate doors or pay separate house taxes, do not need to apply for sublease house licenses. Furthermore, from now on, the third paragraph of the sublease house license rules is amended as follows:

"The licensee shall clearly list the exact amount of rent paid to the landlord, along with the amount of the municipal tax license fee and utility bills for the previous month (if the licensee provides lighting for their tenants), and post it in a conspicuous location within the house. If the licensee subleases the entire house, they may charge a profit of up to 20% calculated according to the above-mentioned burdens. If the licensee subleases any part of the house, they may charge the same profit proportionally. The all-inclusive rent for each subleased part of the house should be listed, and the portion allocated for the part used by the licensee themselves should also be listed separately in the list. If any question or dispute arises as to whether the rent allocation between the subleased parts is appropriate, the Council may, on its own initiative or upon written request from any sublease tenant, determine the appropriate rent for each subleased part of the house. Licensees shall not add any tips paid to the landlord or any renovation costs for the house to the rent of the sublease tenants to compensate for them."

Regarding the business of member banks and pawnshops, strict examinations will be carried out, and they must operate within the scope of business stipulated by laws and regulations. Banks and pawnshops are prohibited from directly engaging in the sale and purchase of commodities for profit and from providing loans to individuals using commodities as collateral to facilitate funding in order to stabilize finance and avoid fueling speculation.

### Rice Purchase Certificates for Next Month Will Be Issued Soon

The Third Week Rationing Began Yesterday

Rice stores in the two concessions began selling the third installment of rations yesterday, issuing rice based on the third set of purchase certificates. Each purchase certificate can purchase half a liter of white rice, one liter of broken rice, and one and a half catties of flour, which together cost 7.2 yuan in savings certificates. The validity period of the third set of purchase certificates is from yesterday until the 26th.

### Foreign Nationals Registration in the French Concession Has Ended

The registration of foreign nationals from third countries residing in the French Concession and the Western District ended yesterday (the 20th) afternoon and will not be extended, as all such foreign nationals have been registered. According to French police personnel, those who register must be guaranteed by two people, but the guarantors do not have to be residents of the French Concession. Any foreign nationals from third countries who have not yet registered will not be able to obtain a citizen's card and will lose their future rationed food.

### Application for Student Aid Begins: Register Quickly by Filling Out Forms; Application Deadline Approaching, Please Don't Delay. Readers Enthusiastically Donate Funds.

Yesterday, the first day for the third session of our newspaper's student aid application, students from various primary and secondary schools came to our office to collect forms from morning till night, an unprecedentedly crowded scene. This clearly shows the vast number of young people out of school and the deep and urgent need for support from enthusiastic individuals from all walks of life. Based on the amount of donations received so far, the number of students who can receive assistance is very small. We urge our readers to have compassion for the hungry and those in need, to make a wish to help others help themselves, and to donate generously. This is what we earnestly hope for.

Collect Forms in Person at Our Office

Students from various schools with financial difficulties who wish to collect forms must come to our office in person. Each person is limited to one form and cannot entrust others to collect it on their behalf, and even more so, cannot send servants to collect it. Otherwise, our office will refuse. Furthermore, our office will consider the situation and advance the deadline for application. We hope you will apply as soon as possible, don't delay.

Readers Donate More Enthusiastically

Yesterday, Mr. Tao generously donated 2,000 yuan, Mr. Wang Shenfu of Zhaotai Cotton Cloth Company donated 1,000 yuan through the Wang Chunde Hall, Li Jinshan donated 50 yuan (for his late mother's 12th anniversary memorial from friends), and the Commercial Press (gleanings) donated 7.5 yuan.

### Population Census Completed in Both Concessions and the Chinese Area; Foreign Residents' Baojia System Organization Underway

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reports that, according to information received this morning (the 20th), the population census statistics for the Baojia system in the Shanghai concessions and the Chinese area will be ready for announcement by the 24th or 25th of this month. Except for the large number of German refugees in the Hongshan District, the figures for other residents are almost completely calculated. The registration of foreign residents by the Baojia organs in the French Concession was completed on July 1st, and the statistics for the total number of residents in the French Concession were compiled by July 15th. The work in the Western District began on July 5th and will be completed today. The organizational work for the foreign residents' Baojia organs is also currently underway. It is noted that Chinese residents have already formed their own Baojia system, and Japanese residents have a "neighborhood system." These organizations are all helpful to the authorities. Therefore, the organization of foreign residents' Baojia will also be beneficial to themselves and the municipality. It is heard that the exact duties of the foreign residents' Baojia have not yet been fully decided. However, according to the opinion of police personnel, foreign residents are unlikely to patrol the streets.

### Seasonal Diseases are Prevalent; Pay Attention to Health Preservation

Cholera has not yet disappeared in this city, and its spread is quite serious. The authorities in both concessions are actively carrying out prevention and control measures. According to reporter inquiries, 98 patients have been confirmed to have true cholera at the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital on Yu Qiaqing Road. Cases have also been found in other epidemic hospitals. Although most of the infected areas are in the Chinese area, six cases have also been found in the French Concession, and one case has been found in Hongkou. The Public Concession is still safe for the time being. It is generally expected that the epidemic can be suppressed after citizens receive the second injection of vaccine.

According to a report from the Health Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession, within the week before midnight on July 18, 1942, the number of cases and deaths from infectious diseases were as follows: scarlet fever and diphtheria, 5 cases, 2 deaths; tuberculosis, 79 cases, 50 deaths; cholera, 15 cases, 1 death; typhoid fever, 50 cases, 43 deaths; typhus, 14 cases, 9 deaths; choleraic diarrhea, 19 cases, 2 deaths; other diseases, 576 cases.

### Subsidies for Private Schools from the Shanghai Municipal Council Released Yesterday

Must Hold a Formal Letter of Authorization from the School Board. The Chinese Education Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession has always allocated subsidies to well-managed private schools within the concession and designated them for purposes such as improving school buildings and enriching equipment. It is now known that the first installment of subsidies for private schools for the 1941 academic year was released yesterday (the 20th). The Chinese Education Department has informed each school receiving subsidies to come and collect them at the designated time. However, they must hold a formal letter of authorization from the school board and the school's official seal, and have paid the house tax for the autumn of this year before they can collect it from the Shanghai Municipal Council's General Accounting Office.

### Swiss Authorities Broker Agreement; British and Japanese Exchange of Nationals; British Nationals in the Far East to Withdraw from Shanghai in Early August Aboard the Kamakura Maru and Tatsuta Maru to East Africa

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reports that the Japanese Consulate General in this city announced that British nationals will withdraw aboard the Japanese ships Kamakura Maru and Tatsuta Maru in August. Havas News Agency reported from London yesterday that an agreement on the exchange of nationals has been finalized through the mediation of the Swiss authorities. It is expected that a total of 1,800 people will be withdrawn, including nationals of the Allied Powers and the United Kingdom from China, Japan, Manchuria, Vietnam, and the Philippines. They will be transported to Lourenço Marques in Portuguese Africa, where Japanese diplomats and civilians will be exchanged on August 27th and September 7th. It is heard that several Swiss representatives will accompany the withdrawing nationals of the Allied Powers and the United Kingdom on board the Kamakura Maru and Tatsuta Maru, as was done when the Conte Verde and Asama Maru carried American nationals withdrawing from Shanghai and Japan. A Havas dispatch also reports that some of the repatriated nationals will go to India, while the rest will continue their journey by taking two ships from Lourenço Marques to England. One of the ships is said to be the "Nevi," while the name of the other ship has not been disclosed. As for the two Japanese ships, they will load Japanese and Thai nationals withdrawing from England, Australia, India, and Africa at Lourenço Marques. It is also disclosed here that among the 1,800 British nationals to be repatriated, diplomats and missionaries will be the majority, with a small number of civilians. If the number of repatriated people increases, British nationals in other cities will be given priority. At the same time, British Consul Gibson, leading 11 British nationals stationed in Nanjing, will arrive in Shanghai this week from Ningbo to await repatriation to their home country.

### Husband, Wife, and Child Perish in Fire

The Yongli Flag Store on Old North Dou Street in the French Concession caught fire accidentally at 3:30 AM the day before yesterday, resulting in the neighboring Qianzhuang (money shop) owner Dong Zhiliang and his wife, Dong Qiu, being unable to escape and perishing in the fire.

### Ningbo Native Association in Shanghai Seeks Funding for Projects

The Ningbo Native Association in Shanghai issued a notice yesterday stating that after the closing of the 12th Membership Solicitation General Assembly, it was resolved to allocate funds to carry out educational loans, vocational loans, relief work, and subsidies for primary schools. Committee members have been separately assigned to be responsible for handling these matters. The purpose of the above four projects is to universally assist poor fellow countrymen, so that they can have opportunities for schooling, employment, and relief. The educational loan application began on the 15th of this month, and the vocational loan application is scheduled to begin on August 1st. All fellow countrymen who are unable to afford schooling or employment may, with the introduction of two members, come to the association to obtain the regulations and register according to the prescribed form, awaiting review. Relief work will also be carried out sequentially once the council has been convened. However, the funds allocated for this item are limited, while the expenses are huge. It is sincerely feared that it will be difficult to sustain in the future. Therefore, we dare to appeal to enthusiastic fellow countrymen to provide assistance to maintain the permanent nature of the projects. Those who wish to donate to a specific project should state it to the association's accounting office when making the payment. A receipt will be issued separately, and thanks will be announced at any time to demonstrate sincerity. This is hereby announced.

### Ocean-going Ships of German, Italian, Portuguese, and Other Foreign Merchants Restore Chinese Merchant Status; Change Names and Lease to Japanese Merchants for Operations on Various Lines; Shanghai's External Shipping Expected to Show New Vigor

After the outbreak of the Pacific War, Shanghai's external shipping came to a standstill, and industrial and commercial trade was also affected. This was because some shipping companies, originally Chinese merchants, changed to foreign merchant status after the Shanghai war and were forced to suspend business operations. The authorities, aware that this would be very harmful if it continued for a long time, specially approved the restoration of Chinese merchant status to various foreign merchant shipping companies. The ships under their ownership were renamed and leased to Japanese merchant companies for operation. Some did not restore Chinese merchant status but leased their ships directly, while others sold their ships to the Japanese side. The disposal methods for some ships have not yet been decided. However, generally speaking, Shanghai's external shipping and transportation are expected to show new phenomena in the future. Various concrete plans are being promoted step by step.

Permission to Restore Chinese Merchant Status

Shipping companies that changed from Chinese to foreign merchant status and continued to operate after the Shanghai war include: German merchants Reith & Co., Far Eastern Shipping Company, and Lulin & Co.; Portuguese merchants Chengde, Merrill, Huamei, and other shipping companies; and Italian merchants Yihua and Sino-Italian joint venture Sino-Italian shipping companies. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, the shipping businesses of the above companies were virtually suspended, and all their ships were completely out of service. They have now been approved by the authorities to restore Chinese merchant status. The ships will be renamed and leased to the Japanese merchants China Shipping Company and East Asia Steamship Association for operation on the: Shanghai-Ningbo line, Shanghai-Dinghai line, including Wan Shenjiamen, Shanghai-Chongming line (Baozhen) (Nandou Port), Shanghai-Yangzhou Qian, Shanghai-Xinshenggang line, Shanghai-Qinglonggang line, Shanghai-Nantong line (Renjiagang) (Tianshenggang), Shanghai-Hankou line.

List of Renamed and Leased Ships

The ships that have restored Chinese merchant status, changed names, and been leased to Japanese merchant companies total several, including Moufu and Haifu. They are listed below:

Ship Name     Original Name    Renamed       Lessor       Lessee Company

Moufu         German           Xin Ningshao Xin Ningshao East Asia
Haifu         German           Zhoushan      Wansheng   China
Hana          German           Chuanshan     Unchanged China
Feikang       German           Xin Ruian     Ruifeng   China
Gaodeng       German           Yongchuan     Dafeng   China
Tanglu        Portuguese         Xin Baohua    Wanji   China
Tangsai       Portuguese         Dahua       Huaxiang   China
Meifa         Portuguese         Ruihua      Xinping   China
Aweimari    Portuguese       Maoli       Yuanhe   China

German Ships Sold to the Japanese Side

The ships sold to the Japanese side are the five that belonged to Portuguese merchants after the Shanghai war: Tang Qiao (formerly Baohua), Tang Bei (formerly Pingyang), Baoli (formerly Yili), Wanli (formerly Xin Haimen), and Meida (formerly Xin Ruiping). The four ships Kangshayi, Ende, Batuola, and Enji, which were operated by the Sino-Italian joint venture Sino-Italian Company after the Shanghai war, are now leased to the Yamashita Steamship Company. The disposal methods for the German Ping and the Portuguese merchant Shantai ships, which are currently staying in Shanghai under the Sino-Italian Company, are being negotiated.

### Second Meeting on Collecting Exhibits for the Greater East Asia Exposition

The collection of goods from this city for the Greater East Asia Exposition has been decided by the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to convene a meeting of various industrial and commercial circles in this city to determine the implementation methods for collecting exhibits and to proceed with the collection. It is now learned that the association convened a second meeting at the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce at 2:00 PM the day before yesterday. After discussion, it was decided that the participating industries must notify the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce in writing of the names, types, quantities, unit prices, and total prices of the exhibits by the 25th of this month. If there is a need for consultation, they can also contact the office at any time.

### Shanghai Municipal Council's Health Report for June

In terms of infectious diseases last month, the public health situation in this city can be described as peaceful. Typhus has decreased significantly, while typhoid fever is more prevalent than in May, but considering the vast area and dense population of this city, the increase is not significant. Vaccination activities continued last month, with 336,206 citizens receiving free vaccinations. In total, 951,205 people have been vaccinated this year. No cholera cases have been found. Near the end of the month, the Health Department, in view of the impending closure of the hospital founded by the Jewish Refugee Committee, began to find ways to accommodate Jewish refugees suffering from infectious diseases.

The number of recorded deaths of Chinese people was 2,733, including 1,400 unclaimed corpses. The main causes of death were tuberculosis, typhoid fever, etc. The number of people requesting treatment for dog rabies from the Health Department was 114. Medical affairs in the schools established by the bureau continued as usual. A total of 1,812 students in the schools were found to have trachoma. Members were sent to inspect the 176 Chinese private schools receiving subsidies from the bureau. The operation of various vegetable markets was as usual. The supply of meat and fish was not smooth, and the quality was poor. The supply of vegetables was quite sufficient. A total of 10,899 citizens were vaccinated. The work of eliminating mosquitoes and flies continued actively. Various licensed venues were notified separately to prepare flytraps. Free tap water was opened daily for the use of those lacking water facilities. There are currently seven refugee shelters, accommodating a total of 2,431 refugees. A second flea extermination campaign was held in the centralized shelters last month. The sanitary conditions in the shelters are satisfactory. A total of 1,327 bodies were cremated, and 739 unclaimed coffins were buried. A total of 52,07 coffins are currently stored in various funeral homes and coffin storage places. The coffins are all in good condition. Regarding the handling of street corpses, the Health Department has not received many complaints from the public.

### Young Man Commits Suicide by Taking Medicine in French Park

### Second Landlord Beats Tenant; Police Order Arrest of Assailant

Shen Baohua, the second landlord of No. 7 Yanging Lane, Xiamen Road, on the 12th of this month, demanded a rent increase from Chen Caisheng (45 years old, from Changzhou), a tailor renting three rooms in the living room. When the demand was not met, he gathered more than ten hooligans and beat Chen, injuring his left waist. Afterwards, Chen abandoned his home and fled. Only one accomplice, Yu Ruifeng, was captured. The details have been briefly reported. It is now learned that Chen was sent to Renji Hospital for treatment by the police after being injured. Although he has recovered slightly, he is still not out of danger. As for the perpetrator Shen Baohua, the police have been sending detectives to guard his house for days, but he has not been captured. A lot of evidence of violations of the law has been found in his house. He is now being strictly ordered to be arrested.

### Da Ya Engineering Company Produces Automobile Carburetors

Since the supply of gasoline in Shanghai became unsustainable, many people have converted their cars to burn charcoal. However, there are very few who truly engage in this with both engineering principles and experience. Now there is the Da Ya Engineering Company, which is organized by former Jiaotong University professor Mr. Fang and others. It employs engineers who are members of various engineering societies in China and skilled technicians, specializing in the manufacture of carburetors for automobiles. Each machine is specially designed, operates rationally and sensitively, is easy to handle and economical. It is equipped with both electric and hand-cranked blowers, starting in less than five minutes, which is unmatched by ordinary products. It also uses a chemical gas purifier and an oil filter to clean the gas and mix machine oil into the cylinder, which lubricates the inside of the cylinder, making the action more reliable and saving lubricating oil. Installation takes a short time and is inexpensive. Use is guaranteed after installation, and free service is provided. The company welcomes people from all walks of life to try it out and can contact the office at Jiyu Cheng Building, Jiangxi Road (telephone 13195), or the engineering department at the old site of Xiang Sheng Automobile Station, Foch Road (telephone 31212) for nearby contact.

### Shanghai Out-of-School Relief Center Enrolls Students for the Second Free Middle School

The First Free Middle School attached to the Shanghai Out-of-School Relief Center has been established for two years.

### Letter

To the Editor,

I am writing to you on behalf of my client, Mr. Xi Shengyuan, owner of Taichang Car Company, who states that he has read a news item in today's "Shen Bao" about various car companies receiving stolen goods. The part that involves my client's company is not in accordance with the facts. Zhang Rongqing is one of the employees of this company, and he is not the store owner. Zhang was entrusted by a friend to pack tires that the friend had purchased elsewhere for transportation. He was implicated by this, which was completely unexpected. This matter has nothing to do with this company. Fearing that inaccurate rumors may harm the reputation of the company, I am specially commissioned by the company to send a letter requesting correction. Accordingly, I am sending this letter on behalf of my client, hoping that you will publish it in the "Letters to the Editor" column of your newspaper to make a correction.

Sincerely, Lawyer Ma Junshuo

Today's Newspaper will be published at 6PM.

Business News

### Government Bonds in Latent Period; Trade is Light; Situation is Fluctuating

The over-the-counter market for government bonds was even quieter yesterday. The strong players were all spectators. The market was uncertain, with more declines than gains on the surface. The situation is still fluctuating, but the longer the fluctuation lasts, the greater the change that will brew in the future. It is generally believed that the powerful players are now gathered in the Chinese stock market and are no longer interested in government bonds. However, this is not the case. I expect that there will be a great rebound in the near future, but it will take some time. Those who are good at reading newspapers should know the general outline. Therefore, it is known that it cannot remain latent for long. Yesterday's market price results showed that only Class A bonds rose by 10 cents, while the rest all fell by a small amount of 20 to 30 cents. The turnover was only more than 500,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:

### Chinese Stocks Weak, More Declining Than Rising

The Chinese stock market sentiment is erratic, shifting from stable to weak. Among department stores, only Wing On showed a profit, while Sincere declined. China Underwear saw the most active trading, with prices rebounding slightly after a significant increase last weekend. Shanghai Cotton Textiles held firm, Hanyeping was high. Wing On Textiles remained stable. Cultural and New Pharmaceutical stocks both underperformed. Zhabei Water & Electricity and China General Edison continued to fall. Trading volume was thin. Today, we again record the market prices below:

Stock Name	Highest	Lowest

Wing On Co.	167.50	121.50

Sincere Co.	150.00	140.00

China Underwear	44.00	41.00

### Gold and Silver Jewelry Prices Unchanged

Yesterday, the selling price of gold jewelry per tael by major jewelry stores in the city remained unchanged at 2,250 yuan (purchases reduced by 350 yuan). Inter-dealer prices ranged from 1,965 yuan to 1,925 yuan per tael, settling at 1,940 yuan at noon, a decrease of 20 yuan. The market was generally weak, with sparse trading. In the afternoon, the price was 1,978 yuan. The listed price for standard silver jewelry remained at 16 yuan per tael, with inter-dealer prices at 11.56 yuan.

### Call Loan Rate Reaches 1.5%

Yesterday, the military note market saw inter-dealer trading at 5.545 yuan, with retail bid and ask prices at 5.4 and 5.55 yuan.

Yesterday, the Shanghai Money Dealers Association suddenly raised the call loan rate by 40%, reaching 1.5%, reportedly due to the flat discounting of new exchange-issued drafts.

### Cotton Cloth Falls Excessively, Small Rebound

Yesterday, the factory cloth market turned around, with prices gradually rebounding, likely due to the excessive falls of the previous week, warranting a reaction. 16-pound "Globe" coarse cloth opened at 175 yuan in the morning, later rising to 180 yuan with buyers. "Flying Goose" coarse cloth was at 177 yuan. 12-pound "Globe" fine cloth was at 166 yuan. "Dapeng" new singles were at 160 yuan, "Fugui" at 161 yuan, "Fugui" fine twill at 42 yuan, and "Magnolia" bleached cloth at 165 yuan, "Qin Liangyu" at 155 yuan, all rising by 5-6 yuan per piece. "Changshou" silk pongee was at 6.25 yuan, "Volleyball" at 4 yuan, and "Three Rams" gingham at 6.2 yuan, all seeing transactions. "Peach Blossom" ladies' crepe opened at 258.5 yuan, closing at 263 yuan at noon and reaching a high of 264 yuan in the afternoon, closing at 263.5 yuan, also up 6 yuan from last week, indicating a firm monthly trend. No. 1 East cloth first fell and then rose, showing a strong upward trend. 12-pound "Dragon Head" fine cloth new singles opened at 175 yuan. Both internal and external buying interest increased, gradually rising to a high of 184 yuan, closing at 182.5 yuan at noon, up 6 yuan from last Saturday. Both the industry and its peers were absorbing supply, leading to a general shortage of mid-to-low-end fine cloths. "Dragon Head" bank singles rose to 162 yuan, "Color Ball" to 168 yuan, "Flying Fish" to 164 yuan, "Five Blessings" fine twill to 165 yuan, and "Baby" fine twill to 160 yuan. "Four Gentlemen" gingham opened only at 6.68 yuan in the morning. Short covering and new longs rushed to accumulate, tightening supply. The price closed at 7.02 yuan at noon, also up about 0.23 yuan.

### Summer Woolen Fabrics Sell Slowly

With the arrival of midsummer, woolen fabric sales are naturally weak, as Chinese garments mostly use silk gauze and other materials. Western suits are also mostly made of fabric now due to high prices. Most retail shops are experiencing slow business. The daily market gatherings in places like Chessboard Street and Changle Paradise tea houses are also gradually decreasing. Since the authorities have suppressed prices, hoarding has already stopped, and wholesale transactions have suddenly become scarce.

### Stable Grain Market

Yesterday, only a few bean transactions occurred, just a slight addition, presenting a stable market. Chongming sand silkworm beans, 20 bags, were priced at 105 yuan. Tianjin tea beans, 25 bags, were priced at 210 yuan.

Sweet potato dried slices had both good arrivals and sales with little change. Yesterday, Jiangbei sweet potato dried slices, 50 bags, remained priced at 110 yuan, and Shandong sweet potato dried slices in straw bags, 30 bags, were priced at 107 yuan.

Yesterday, the bean cake market was quite stable. Although inland consumption was not yet active, people's minds were unusually stable, and prices consistently hovered without much fluctuation. Li Zi brand cake, May new crop, 1,000 pieces, was priced at 67.45 yuan. Qing Zhong brand cake, 300 pieces, was priced at 65.5 yuan. Fei Zi brand cake, April, one cart, was priced at 63 yuan. Shen Ji brand cake, March, Wan Gu Zhan delivery order, 500 pieces, was priced at 62 yuan, and April, 500 pieces, was priced at 63.25 yuan. June, 500 pieces, was priced at 65 yuan. May, Yoshida Zhan delivery order, 500 pieces, was priced at 69 yuan.

Bran sales shifted from sluggish to active, showing a market trending from stable to firm. San Xin small bag bran, May delivery order, 300 bags, was priced from 93 yuan to 95 yuan.

### Sugar Shares Dumped by Scattered Hoarders

Yesterday, sugar share trading at the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office declined sharply due to dumping by scattered hoarders, falling by as much as six yuan. However, sugar firms were buying at the same time, so transaction volume increased. Coarse sugar shares opened at 305.5 yuan, falling directly to close at 301 yuan, with 3,800 bags traded. Raw sugar shares were bid at a little over five yuan, at 290 yuan, but no transactions occurred.

### Fresh Cabbage Prices Fall

Fresh Xuzhou cabbage prices softened as buyers from the Beijing-Shanghai region did not procure directly from the production areas, and the amount of goods on the market gradually increased. Yesterday, prices fell by over ten yuan with the Lianbang group, but reaching agreement on volume was still difficult. However, it is possible agreement could be approached.

### Cigarettes Increasingly Declining

The cigarette market continued its downward trend, with local purchasing power weakening considerably. Sales through various channels were rare, resulting in increasingly quiet trading. Consumer sentiment was weary, and market prices declined sharply. Yesterday's opening prices included "Great Britain" brand at 8,000 yuan, "Old Knife" brand at 5,100 yuan, "Pin Hai" brand at 4,400 yuan, "Wu Hua" brand at 3,200 yuan, and "Fairy" brand at 3,250 yuan, a sharp drop of 100-200 yuan compared to last weekend. Japanese cigarettes were inevitably following suit, with "Gold Gun" brand down to 1,250 yuan, "Golden Mansion" brand at 1,800 yuan, "Red Rose" brand at 900 yuan, "All Green" brand at 1,450 yuan, "20 Sticks All Prosperous" brand at 1,500 yuan, "Compass" brand at 1,100 yuan, domestic "Golden Rat" brand at 1,500 yuan, "Beauty" brand at 2,800 yuan, and "Pyramid" brand at 3,000 yuan.

### Hardware Market Unremarkable

Recently, the hardware market has been difficult to assess in terms of prosperity or decline, as sales through various channels are vastly different from the past. Moreover, current hardware products have reached a point of balanced supply and demand, resulting in a rather bleak market sentiment. Industry bids and asks largely follow the public meeting quotations from two weeks ago, and the market for various goods is largely unremarkable. We now record the standard market prices below. Originally, purchases of rivets were numerous due to a shortage of circulating goods, so the "Times" price rose from 700 yuan to as high as 750 yuan per barrel. However, inquiries have been scarce since yesterday and today, and the enthusiasm has dissipated. Consequently, industry prices have returned from 750 yuan to 700 yuan, showing no difference from the public meeting quotation. In addition, cement, steel bars, and other key items have fallen back by 1,000 yuan to match the public meeting quotation, with the former selling for 10,000 yuan per ton and the latter for 7,000 yuan per ton. New angle iron sells for 13,000 yuan per ton, and new foreign coins, foreign squares, and foreign plates all sell for 12,000 yuan per ton. Plain galvanized iron ranges from 30,000 to 32,000 yuan per ton, with "Che Guang Yuan Zheng" brand at 20,000 yuan and "Deputy" brand at 18,000 yuan, all showing little difference from the public meeting quotations.

### Sesame Rivet Sales Sluggish

Since the factory output of sesame rivets has been low, the local inventory is feeling the pinch. Fortunately, sales through various channels have also stopped, so there is no imbalance between supply and demand. Previously, merchants from the Tianjin, Yantai and Northern routes were the main buyers of this product, followed by local factory users. Door-to-door transactions were also lively. However, these wholesale businesses have disappeared recently, with only sporadic retail transactions at shops. The hoarding trend has also vanished long ago, as hoarders no longer consider hardware to be worth hoarding. Industry sentiment is naturally difficult to boost, and standard sales quotations remain stable. Yesterday, 3-point flower color was priced at 1,400 yuan per box, 4-point flower color at 1,300 yuan, 5-point goods were quoted at 1,200 yuan, and 6-point goods sold for 1,100 yuan per box. The market is difficult to assess in terms of prosperity or decline compared to the past.

Spring and Autumn

### Life and Survival

— Yan Yan

Sitting in a rickshaw, with my coat open to the wind, I didn't feel the heat at all; but the rickshaw puller in front, running barefoot, was covered in sweat. Some people think this is inhumane, and they shout the slogan "Why am I riding while he's pulling?" I don't think that way. I'm thinking about another problem: that life is suffering.

The rickshaw puller's profession is pulling rickshaws. He should pull, and pulling is his life. Although we seem to be at a distance from him when we sit in the rickshaw, in our professions, our suffering is just like running under the scorching sun, or even worse.

Being a chauffeur is much more comfortable than being a rickshaw puller. The master spends money to buy a car, rent a garage, and hire a chauffeur. The enjoyment is not the same, except that the master sits in the back and the chauffeur sits in the front. But the chauffeur also has his own suffering. For example, if the master is out all night, the chauffeur can only curl up in the car and doze off; if something goes wrong with the car, the chauffeur always takes the blame.

In short, life is suffering! There is no need to envy others, just have the courage to survive.

### Airing Clothes

— Kuang Cheng

The drying platform is like a clothing exhibition, full of fur coats, overcoats, wool sweaters, felt blankets... Every household is busy rummaging through their trunks and sorting out their clothes, displaying them one by one. These days, the weather is sunny, and everyone wants to take this opportunity to air their clothes.

Granny Huang's family had been busy for five days to dry three trunks of clothes, and now Mr. Huang wants to dry his most treasured ancient books and calligraphy.

The courtyard has already been converted into a living room, and the drying platform is also full of clothes, so he had to move a large pile of books and paintings into the alley, leaning them against the foot of the wall to dry.

A group of mischievous children thought there was something fun to see, and gathered around to watch. If no one was looking, they would start flipping through the books and messing with the paintings, which caused Mr. Huang a lot of trouble. He had no choice but to carry a stool, sit at the door, and when he saw the children approaching, his mouth would twitch and he would start scolding:

"Little devils, don't mess around!"

Some fearless children found it funny that she was so angry, so they kicked a book with their feet and said:

"Nothing special!"

Granny Huang got even more angry and scolded fiercely:

"Nothing special, see if your house has anything to dry!"

Mrs. Mao returned home from work and saw people drying books and clothes. She remembered the overcoat and cheongsam in her trunk, and Grandpa Mao's fur coat... Although there weren't many, she still had to dry them for a while to avoid mildew, so she could wear them in winter.

After returning home, Mrs. Mao dragged the trunk out from under the bed, but when she opened the lid, besides three summer shirts, there were no overcoats or fur coats!

"Ah! Someone stole them!" She was shocked, but then she thought about it and felt that no one had ever come to steal, it must have been Grandpa Mao's doing.

She rushed to the bed and pushed Grandpa Mao, who was snoring, forcefully, and asked:

"Where did the clothes in the trunk go?"

Grandpa Mao turned over and said slowly: "I don't know!"

"Tell me!" Mrs. Mao shouted a few times, "Don't pretend!"

"I owed Zhang the Blind money, and he was pressing me to pay it back, so I had to pawn the clothes to him!"

Mrs. Mao couldn't help but get angry, "Bullshit, you lost gambling again, you have no ambition, we only have these few clothes, what will we wear in winter..."

After Mrs. Mao finished speaking, she cried. But the sound of Granny Huang arguing with the children in the alley came in again:

"See if your house has anything to dry!"

### Making Cakes

— Xing Hua

The second week's household ration of rice: in addition to one liter of white rice and half a liter of broken rice, you can also buy one and a half catties of flour. My family has eleven people, so we bought sixteen and a half catties of flour.

After buying the flour, we made pumpkin dumplings on the first day and vegetable wontons on the second day. Because we don't usually eat much pasta, eating it a few times occasionally tastes exceptionally delicious. A few days later, we planned to make red bean paste cakes to change the flavor.

I also joined the work of making red bean paste cakes with curiosity and excitement. First, kneading the dry flour requires perseverance. The more time spent, the better, to make it smooth and soft. Second, like making glutinous rice balls, pinch it into a bowl-shaped embryo, then put in the red bean paste and make it into a round body. Pressing it flat is where the expert and the layman differ. When I was slowly flattening it, look! The red bean paste wrapped inside broke through from the thin spot, so I had to patch it up, one piece here, one piece there, turning it into a deformed thing.

I was also responsible for baking. The temperature by the stove was quite high, and sweat dripped constantly, but I didn't want to give up my job to others. The cakes were baked, one plate after another. I recognized all the odd shapes, these were my "masterpieces". So I specially asked others to taste the cakes I made, and the answer I got was a shake of the head. I ate the ones I made myself, and indeed, without telling a lie, they were so delicious!

Making items with labor, whether for yourself or for others to enjoy, is a happy thing. —— This is the reflection I got from making cakes for the first time.

### Life

— Zhang Yueshan

Life is like tea, the deeper you drink, the sooner you will see the dregs at the bottom of the cup. — Baley

Life is short, and time is constantly flowing, like blood flowing from a fatal wound. — Heraclitus

The length of life is not calculated by the number of years he lives, but by the events he encounters in those years. — Wolff

The wisdom of life is often deeper and broader than the wisdom of people. — Gorky

### The Fun of Living

— A Meng

The simplest way to test each person's interests is to observe whether they find something interesting on every page of the newspaper: international news, sports, theater, music, books, stock market transactions, etc. If they do, then they must be living a beautiful life. This not only shows the richness and abundance of life, and the constant expansion of curiosity; it is also the best insurance against the inevitable decline and difficulties of life. Even if a person is unhappy, they can still think of the fun of living. Today's world is not as easy as it was ten years ago, but its fun has become even greater and more boundless. "Translated from Reader's Digest"

### "Cavalier" and the like

— Xu Xizhen

In the famous short novel "Sanin" by Russian writer Artzybashev, we can see many "cavalier" types: they are young in age, but in their souls, they have long lost their confidence and vigor. In the midst of chaos and war, they can only dance, drink, gamble, and play with women, and as a result, they turn into a filthy wisp of smoke in this shocking era… And this kind of posture is not unfamiliar in the streets and alleys of our big and small cities today. We now have quite a few of these cavalier youths in the scum team. They are under the shadow of a special kind of luck, not having to work hard to earn their living, wearing the outer skin or facade of college students, appearing in dance halls, theaters, and around young women with a three-point "young master" and seven-point "playboy" posture, pouring their precious youth into foul-smelling garbage cans, smug and playing the clown of shamelessness and absurdity…

There was a time when I felt quite sorry for these cavalier youths, but now I even feel that this pity is superfluous. What has replaced this pity is a kind of terrible tremor: in the entire history of mankind, there has never been a world that can tolerate self-abandoned scum for long. At most, they can only briefly appear in a short-term darkness. After this dark spirit passes, they can only perish with the vague shadows. In the novel "How the Steel Was Tempered", a hardworking man from an orphanage once said these words to a group of cavalier youths: "We don't need them, we don't want to ask for it anymore, I swear, we definitely don't need you bastards."

### Sharing Weal and Woe

— He Jia Zhi

(7) Swift Thunder

Cui Zhen saw this unusual thing and told Mrs. Ye Er the situation. After hearing the report, Mrs. Ye Er immediately went to Shuangmei Study. Seeing that Wei Cheng looked like he had shed tears, she looked at the desk and saw only thread, old letters, and a few old books. She asked Wei Cheng, "Wei Cheng, is there something wrong?" Wei Cheng forced a smile and said, "I'm fine." Mrs. Ye Er said, "No, Cui Zhen told me that you found a piece of paper in the old books, and you were so startled that your hands were ice-cold and your face changed color. What exactly is going on?" Wei Cheng said, "That's Cui Zhen's overthinking. What I saw was a letter my mother gave me when I was studying in Suzhou. I brought this letter back home from Suzhou, and I felt some emotions when I saw it. Actually, it's nothing." Mrs. Ye Er said, "No, no, your eyelids are still wet, you've been crying. This isn't just emotion." Wei Cheng said, "When I read the letter and looked at the portraits of my father and mother, I thought that when my mother wrote the letter, she was still able to write even though she was sick. Now, my mother is sleeping soundly underground, and she can no longer teach me in letters, so I shed two tears." Mrs. Ye Er said, "I told you a long time ago that people cannot be brought back to life. It's understandable to be sad about your mother's death. But if you keep thinking about it and shedding tears, your mother wouldn't want that either. I always remember your mother saying: Seeing my son eat more, I will eat more too. If your mother were alive, she would definitely be sad to see you sad. Wei Cheng, you've been hiding in Shuangmei Study for the past few days, and you've lost weight. This is not a solution. Visit relatives, don't just keep thinking that you are in mourning, not drinking, not eating meat, not going out. When you were studying at school, didn't they say that modern young people only wear a black纱 on their arms as a sign of mourning for their parents? If you can think that way, you won't just act like a saint at home." Wei Cheng nodded repeatedly and said, "Aunt, I understand." (133)
