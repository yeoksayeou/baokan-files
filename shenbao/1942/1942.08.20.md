### The Caucasus Climate is Ardent; Mountain Warfare is Ongoing; Timoshenko Defends Five Mountain Passes; Fierce Fighting on the Outskirts of Stalingrad

Berlin, 19th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - According to information here, German and allied forces, mostly Slovakian and Romanian mountain troops, under the cover of the German Air Force, are continuing their advance into the Caucasus despite stubborn Soviet resistance, difficult terrain, and the scorching climate. The third stage of the major German offensive on the southern front is now underway. This is mountain warfare, currently taking place in the northern Caucasus. The first stage of the German offensive aimed to seize river areas, especially the Donets River and the Don River, and their tributaries. The second stage of the German offensive was a "lightning war" through plains and steppes. Berlin remains tight-lipped about this offensive, but Stalingrad is clearly the center of current fighting. A glance at the map reveals the city's strategic importance. Fierce fighting has been ongoing in this area for the past month. The German and allied forces are advancing towards the Volga River, greatly threatening the transportation between the northern and southern parts of the Soviet Union. If this route is cut off, the Soviet situation will change drastically. The Soviet forces' desperate attacks on the central and northern fronts of the Eastern Front have yielded nothing but enormous costs. Since July 30th, the Soviet forces have lost as many as 1,000 tanks in the Erzhev area alone, demonstrating the severity of the damage the Soviet forces suffered when attempting to break through German defenses on the central front.

Stockholm, Sweden, 19th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - London telegram, Exchange Telegraph Agency received a report from Moscow stating that the current battle in the Caucasus is a battle for time. The German goal is to advance rapidly and break through the Soviet defenses. The Soviet goal is to withdraw their troops from the plains to the mountainous areas, relying on natural obstacles to resist. General Timoshenko must defend five mountain passes, two of which are larger and can accommodate large armies, and three of which are smaller, easy to defend but difficult to attack. A German armored division has reached Chielsk, the entrance to the Mamison Pass. From here, there are two modernized highways leading to Telavi and Kazbegi. If the German army can pass through one of the smaller mountain passes, it can directly reach the south of the mountain range, and from there advance along the Black Sea coast, a flat route with little difficulty.

Stockholm, Sweden, 19th (Havas News Agency dispatch) - According to semi-official German sources, German mechanized units launched the first general offensive against the outer defenses of Stalingrad yesterday. The intensity of the fighting is increasing with time, but Soviet troops are also resisting fiercely. Northeast of Kotelnikovo, German forces appear to have made considerable progress. German officials remain silent on the development of the war, only saying that the general offensive on Stalingrad has reached a decisive stage, but revealing military secrets too early would only benefit the enemy. Although German progress on the northwest and southwest sides of Stalingrad is slow, it is uncertain. A Soviet counter-offensive seems to be out of the question. On the entire perimeter of Stalingrad, Soviet troops are engaging in defensive warfare, relying on strong defenses. The city's perimeter is heavily mined, providing defense against enemy invasion from any direction.

Somewhere on the Ukrainian border, 18th (Havas News Agency dispatch) - According to news from the Caucasus front, the German army is advancing rapidly in the Grozny area, causing Soviet engineers in several places to fail to destroy oil wells in time. Seventy percent of the oil field equipment in the Maikop area is also intact, and even if damaged, it is easy to repair. The German command is currently keeping silent about the progress of the military situation, indicating that the southern front has entered a decisive stage.

Prominent American socialist leader Thomas said that he had discussed the Indian issue with Secretary of State Hull. According to Hull, although the United States is prepared to mediate, it has not yet taken formal steps. The US authorities believe that the situation in India is extremely serious.

New Delhi City Hall Burned Down

Bombay, 18th (Havas News Agency dispatch) - Disturbances are still occurring in India. The situation in New Delhi is particularly severe. Crowds set fire to the City Hall and the tax bureau office. Military police opened fire on demonstrators to suppress them. The number of casualties is unknown. Most of the demonstrators are workers. A curfew has been imposed in the city, and additional troops have been dispatched to suppress the unrest. In Calcutta, several members of the Congress Party were meeting in a shopping mall.

Chen Youren Discusses the Indian Issue

According to a Domei News Agency report, Chen Youren, who has been in Shanghai for some time after coming from Hong Kong, expressed his views on the Indian issue in writing yesterday, stating that "Gandhi is not only a leader in India, but in the historical significance of this era, Gandhi is indeed a representative figure fighting for Asia. He can even be said to be a valuable symbol of Asia's revitalization, Asia's struggle for self-determination, and Asia's opposition to imperialism's political control and economic exploitation. Asians should have territorial, political, and economic rights in Asia, governing Asia, just as we should not attempt to control and exploit Europe and the Americas. Western countries should not attempt to continue control and exploit in Asia. If Britain insists on its right to rule India today, believing that it is granted by its military force, then the British government should no longer proclaim freedom, human rights, and democracy. Britain's strength today is still sufficient to imprison Gandhi, and it can still arrest Nehru and others one by one. Britain's strength is even sufficient to suppress the Indian revolution, but it must be known that the success or failure of this Indian revolution is of concern to the entire continent of Asia."

### Gandhi's Son Arrested

Lisbon, 19th (Domei News Agency dispatch) - According to a report from New Delhi, Gandhi's son, Devadas Gandhi, has been arrested following other important figures in India.

### Fierce Fighting Erupted in Dieppe, Northern France, Yesterday Morning; German Forces Repulsed Landing British and American Forces; Fighting Continued Until the Afternoon

Berlin, 19th (Domei News Agency dispatch) - According to an announcement here, early this morning, British naval and air forces attacked the Dieppe area of France. Although the scale was larger than previous ordinary attacks, the German counter-attack has cleared a portion of the landing infantry, killing several people. The fighting is still ongoing. The British attack line is quite wide. Fighting is taking place on both sides of the Dieppe area, the eastern and western harbors, and the city. The attack was met with German resistance from the beginning. The British suffered heavy losses. Tanks were destroyed by German artillery, and transport ships were sunk before reaching the shore.

London, 19th (Havas News Agency dispatch) - An official announcement this afternoon stated that Allied forces landed on various points along the French coast this morning according to a pre-arranged plan. A portion of our forces was initially repelled by the enemy, but were still able to reorganize and gain a foothold on French territory. Fighting is underway. The enemy is putting up considerable resistance. At the same time, the American forces stationed in the UK also announced that a unit of American troops participated in this operation, and it is understood that the St. George's Cross troops also participated, but the main force of the landing was the Canadian army, under the overall command of General Mountbatten, Commander of the Assault Forces. According to a statement by General Guffey published by Reuters, "Our army can stay on the French coast for a whole day, but must have a large air force to protect it. This attack on the French coast is not carried out by twenty or thirty soldiers. The purpose of this action is to destroy all military facilities in the port of Dieppe." According to a Reuters interview, Dieppe is an important port, but it has not been frequently bombed by British planes, so its port facilities have not suffered major damage.

London, 19th (Havas News Agency dispatch) - Regarding the British landing on the French coast, a Reuters correspondent reported from the English Channel side of the war, according to reports this morning at eleven o'clock, that the Allied air force was operating in the sky over the French coast, coordinating with the British landing on the northern French coast of Dieppe. It is said that the sound of explosions can still be clearly heard on the French coast of the English Channel, and the intensity of the aerial bombardment is increasing with time. At noon, formations of aircraft were seen flying over Folkestone. The doors and windows of houses in the British coastal area were constantly shaken by the massive explosions. This morning, many planes were seen flying from London towards France to protect the landing of troops, mostly Spitfire planes, but it is believed that units of the American Air Force also took part with British fighters and bombers. The German Air Force attempted to intercept the British and American aircraft, and fierce air battles immediately broke out. According to news this afternoon, fierce fighting is still ongoing in the Dieppe area.

Stockholm, Sweden, 19th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - Newspapers here reported that the British were extremely excited to learn of the Central Army's landing in Dieppe. This morning, crowds gathered outside newspaper offices, eagerly awaiting news of victory. Many believe that this is an attempt by the British army to launch a large-scale offensive, because the British army not only has armored landings, but also has the support of both naval and air forces, which is very different from previous landing attempts.

Berlin, 19th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - This afternoon, authoritative officials here stated that British infantry and tank units, under the cover of a strong naval and air force, attempted to land on the French Channel coast at dawn today. They engaged in fierce fighting with the German forces. Several British vehicles were destroyed by German artillery. The German defense work is proceeding smoothly according to plan.

Berlin, 19th (Havas News Agency dispatch) - The German News Agency announced that British tanks and infantry, under the cover of a large number of aircraft and warships, landed near the port of Dieppe on the northern coast of France this morning, on a wider scale than previous commando landings. The German army has taken action according to plan. Several hundred British troops and several tanks have been destroyed, and several British troop carriers have also been sunk. The British landing points were on a wide coastline to the east and west of the Dieppe city and port. The German army immediately resisted, and a portion of the landing British troops were annihilated by a counterattack. The battle is still ongoing. The German fleet also participated in the defense battle, repelling the British landing.

Berlin, 19th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - This afternoon, a reporter from Haitong News Agency inquired with responsible parties about whether the British attempt to land on both sides of the port of Dieppe on the French Channel coast this morning was related to Churchill's trip to Moscow, and whether the German and French governments had reached an agreement on the British landing in France. The spokesman did not answer.

Vichy, 19th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - French officials stated that they are not surprised by the British landing in the port of Dieppe. The enemy will undoubtedly fail.

### After the Moscow Conference, the Importance of the Near East Becomes Increasingly Apparent, Forming a Direct Operational Zone Responding to the Soviet Union and Britain. The Soviet Ambassador to Iran is Recalled to Return Home.

Lisbon, 19th, Allied News Agency Telegram: According to London sources, the outcome of the Churchill-Stalin meeting in Moscow remains a major secret. Political observers in London and Washington are paying close attention to the developments in the Near East and Transcaucasia. Stalin has a deep understanding of the importance of the Near East. Churchill, after his on-site inspection in Cairo, will be able to inform Stalin in detail about the true location of the key to future battles. The Near East is the most likely area for the direct operational response between the Soviet Union and the Allied countries. With German forces now approaching Transcaucasia, the Allied forces stationed in Syria, Palestine, Iran, and Iraq will naturally be given due consideration.

Turkish Capital, 19th, Allied News Agency Telegram: Following the conclusion of the Churchill-Stalin meeting in Moscow, the Soviet Ambassador to Iran, Smirnov, has been recalled to return home. Well-informed sources speculate that Iran may occupy a significant position in the strategy decided at the Moscow meeting. Lisbon, 19th, Allied News Agency Telegram: According to the Washington Post, the only issue discussed at the Churchill-Stalin meeting was the opening of a second front. It would be foolish to say that the telegram involved other issues, except for how and where to launch the second front and how to coordinate it with the Soviet Union's defensive war. The most suitable candidate is none other than U.S. Army Chief of Staff General Marshall.

Washington, 18th, Havas News Agency Telegram: Diplomatic circles here attach great importance to British Prime Minister Churchill's trip to Moscow and President Roosevelt's personal representative, Harriman, participating in the negotiations between the British and Soviet leaders. It is believed that the outcome of the negotiations must have resulted in historically important decisions, but the nature of the steps agreed upon by both parties is unknown to the outside world. It is believed that neither London nor Moscow will issue any further statements. One of the most important points of this meeting is that the British and Soviet governments, with the support of the United States, have reaffirmed their determination to fight to the end. The Soviet Union is in a difficult situation, but not yet in a critical one. The United Kingdom and the United States should do their utmost to increase material assistance to the Soviet Union. This is one of the main topics of the Moscow meeting. As for the question of opening a second front, it must also have been discussed, without any doubt. However, no one can say for sure what decision was made. It is hoped that the results of the Moscow negotiations will be manifested in concrete actions in the coming weeks.

British Forces Concentrate in Northern Iran, Reportedly to Fight Alongside the Soviets

Swiss Capital, 18th, Havas News Agency Telegram: The Swiss Daily News recently reported that London is rife with rumors that after Prime Minister Churchill's visit to Moscow, Stalin has agreed to open a second front in 1943. The Soviet side has also acknowledged that thorough preparations must be made before taking decisive action, which cannot be completed in the short term. The New Zurich Daily News also reported that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and British Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs Sir Cadogan both participated in the Moscow talks, indicating that the two sides discussed important diplomatic issues. The use of the word "resistance" in the official communique further demonstrates that the political factor was still in an important position at the Moscow meeting. However, according to the Swiss newspapers' correspondents in Berlin, German political figures do not attach much importance to Prime Minister Churchill's trip, believing that the Soviet Union is in a very difficult situation, and the British Prime Minister's trip was to personally explain the situation to Stalin and to test the strength of the Soviet government. The diplomatic correspondent of the Geneva Post believes that the gains and losses of the Caucasian states are closely related to the interests of both Britain and the Soviet Union. It is expected that the second front will soon be opened in the Caucasus. In addition, a telegram from the correspondent of the Basel News in Budapest confirms that a large number of fresh troops have recently been transferred to strengthen the defense of the British forces captured in France. The Tenth Army stationed in Iran and Iraq is currently concentrating in northern Iran. It is not impossible for British forces to fight alongside the Soviet Red Army on the Caucasian front in the shortest possible time. In addition, it is also learned that Prime Minister Churchill requested Stalin to order the Soviet ambassadors to Britain and the United States to immediately stop advocating for the opening of a second front, as the activities of these ambassadors are sufficient to disrupt public opinion in Britain and the United States and weaken the position of Churchill and Roosevelt. The most effective way for Britain and the United States to assist the Soviet Union is to accelerate the supply of armaments to the Soviet Union and bomb German industrial centers.

### South African Federal Cabinet Prime Minister, General Smuts, Returns Home. It is Claimed That the Outcomes of the Moscow and Cairo Meetings Have a Far-Reaching Impact on the Allied War Effort.

Swiss Capital, 19th, Allied News Agency Telegram: South African Federal Cabinet Prime Minister General Smuts has returned to the South African capital after meeting with Prime Minister Churchill in Cairo. Although he is unwilling to comment on the outcome of the meeting, he is very optimistic, believing that the results of the meetings in Moscow and Cairo will have a far-reaching impact on the Allied war effort.

Pretoria, South Africa, 18th, Havas News Agency Telegram: General Smuts, who recently met with Prime Minister Churchill in Cairo, stated here, "We have thoroughly studied all aspects of the current war and have taken important measures. In short, the Cairo and Moscow meetings will have a very important impact on future war plans."

Lisbon, 19th, Allied News Agency Telegram: According to Cairo sources, after British Prime Minister Churchill arrived in Cairo from Moscow, General Smuts and General de Gaulle, the leader of the Free French forces, had lengthy talks with him to discuss cooperation between Britain and the Free French forces in the Middle East.

Cairo, 19th, Havas News Agency Telegram: Regarding British Prime Minister Churchill's visit to Cairo from Moscow, the official communique was issued for the first time today, stating that British Army Chief of Staff General Brooke and Permanent Under-Secretary of the Foreign Office Cadogan accompanied Prime Minister Churchill on this trip. During their stay in Cairo, they met with South African Federal Prime Minister General Smuts, Indian Commander-in-Chief General Wavell, British Minister of State in the Near East Casey, and the commanders of the British armed forces in the Near East, then went to inspect the front lines of Alamein, and met with General Roxwell, the commander of the U.S. forces in the Near East.

Stockholm, Sweden, 19th, Reuter News Agency Telegram: British newspapers' comments on the Moscow Conference are mostly speculative and lack a solid basis. The only exception is the claim that the Soviet Union does not intend to make a separate peace. In addition, the British newspapers still attach importance to the talk of opening a second front. British newspapers speculate that the Moscow Conference often involves the Caucasus and the Mediterranean, believing that the British forces stationed in the Middle East will take large-scale actions, firstly because Churchill stayed in Egypt for a week before arriving in Moscow, inspecting various places, seemingly with some intention, and met with important figures such as Generals Auchinleck, de Gaulle, and Smuts, which should be a thorough discussion, and secondly, the appointment of the Commander-in-Chief of the Middle East is noteworthy. When General Alexander was appointed to an important position, British newspapers had the good news of "General Alexander protects Alexandria, a cause for celebration." It is said that Alexander is not only brave and capable but also proficient in tactics and has the talent to command all armies.

### Alexander Succeeds as Commander-in-Chief of the British Middle East Forces. Montgomery to Head the Eighth Army. Auchinleck and Ritchie are Dismissed.

General Alexander, the former Commander-in-Chief of Burma, has been appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Middle East Forces, and Lieutenant General Montgomery has been appointed Commander of the Eighth Army. It is also learned that General Alexander has arrived at the military headquarters in Egypt.

Cairo, 18th, Havas News Agency Telegram: The British Middle East Command Headquarters recently issued a war report stating that on the night of the 16th of this month, there was only scout activity on the Egyptian front line, and air force activity was subdued. However, Axis aircraft bombed the island of Malta heavily.

### Churchill to Deliver a Broadcast Speech Reporting on His Visit to the Soviet Union

London, 18th, Havas News Agency Telegram: After returning to London, British Prime Minister Churchill telegraphed Stalin to thank him for the generous hospitality. It was previously reported that his telegram contained the following words: "I found this trip delightful, as it allowed me to explain everything to you, which is my responsibility, and meeting with you will greatly benefit the cooperation between our two countries." Reuters recently issued a correction, stating that the Prime Minister did not mention that his trip to the Soviet Union was for "explanation." According to Reuters, many Members of Parliament hope that the House of Commons can convene as soon as possible to hear Churchill's report on his trip to the Soviet Union, but the government has no intention of doing so. It is only known that Churchill himself may deliver a broadcast speech to the nation, as he did upon his return from the United States.

### Films Shown in Broad Daylight. Italian Scientist Invents "Daytime Movie" Machine

### From Lecturing to Imprisonment (2)

— Tie Ming

I do not deny that I was indeed afraid in my heart. When I came out of the Suforai Cafe, I already felt that this was not entirely child's play. However, since the outbreak of the war in China, I have been through many dangers, so I am a little used to it. Moreover, at this time, I was already "forced to Liangshan", so could I just give up? Wouldn't that make people laugh and underestimate the courage of the Chinese? Besides, this kind of thing is like talking about ghosts, the more afraid you are, the more you want to hear about it. My curiosity has always been very strong.

At that time, I pondered for a while, thinking about Confucius's spirit of "Heaven gave me virtue, what can Huan Tui do to me?", and I became much braver. I almost blurted out the Chinese saying "Life and death are determined by fate." So he went on talking.

"Ge Lehua is a great scientist, as you know. He hates that modern science is used by non-scientists to do whatever they want. He said,"We have discovered the principles that govern matter, but they use it to create new industries and new wars!" So he insisted on breaking free from the control of the financial groups and using the power of science according to his own wishes to benefit the people. He knew that wave mechanics was enough to bring a new era to the entire field of chemistry, so when he heard that Yougen (Eneken) and Peng Yuanfu (Bonhofer) proved that hydrogen is a mixture, he knew that this was just a starting point. He immediately ended his last research, finished his report, sold his family property, and went to the countryside to buy a house. He completely wallpapered the walls with white paper and lived there to calculate the wave equation of gold atoms. The difficulty of this work can be imagined. A person who can do such a thing can easily calculate the orbit of a new planet in a dancing hall with melodious music in an evening, can't they?

"He worked eight hours a day, using a wooden model to move around, writing many formulas on the white walls of each room. Of course, the calculations were done on thin paper, but he said he wanted to write the main formulas on the wall so that they could be easily found when needed. He worked like this for a year and a half, filling all the walls. Finally, he compiled the final results in a notebook. I have seen this notebook, but unfortunately, it is not in my hands now. Later, he spent more than half a year deducing that gold atoms have properties that are very different from what previous chemists expected and have a great affinity with a certain organic compound. So he went to find Li Gan (Riquter). Li Gan was his classmate and an excellent organic chemist. He helped him make some of these organic drugs, and their laboratory work was completely completed.

"My name is Martin, which is actually irrelevant because I am not long for this world. I am a chemist in a factory in Nanterel. Li Gan has always been familiar with me, so they brought me along to the estuary (Bonehe dnRhone) on the long sandbar near Aiques Mortes, a small village called Saint Leoeadte, to start boiling salt. The salt was not good, but it could be sold. But this was not our purpose. There is gold in seawater, as you know, about one in twenty million. When the salt water is dried and the salt crystallizes, there is a concentrated solution left, which is mostly salts such as magnesium sulfate. After these salts have successively crystallized out, the remaining brine contains about one in twenty thousand gold. This is very impressive. Some gold sands only contain one in a million gold and are still very profitable. To this final brine, Li Gan's compound was added - we call it "gold medium", the composition of which I am not very clear, I only know that it is made of a kind of soap gel, with two secret circles in the molecular structure, no, maybe three - just adding seven or eight millionths is enough. Leave it for about an hour, and then blow air into it. The dark blue gold medium and gold combine to form a red substance. This is purely a surface phenomenon of the micro-layer. The red substance floats up from the mother liquor and turns into foam. This foam is collected, steamed dry, and acid is added, and the gold precipitates out! And the blue gold medium is also restored at the same time and can be reused, with a maximum loss of less than 10% each time.

"My job was to manage the blower, Li Gan was in charge of the main manufacturing work, and Ge Lehua himself managed the commercial side. Of course, we hired many local people to do the stupid work, but we only picked the stupidest people who didn't understand anything, only knowing that we were boiling salt."

"Started in January 1937, May to September was the trial period, and from September to the end of the year, we shipped a hundred million francs worth of goods. Most of this paid off our debts, with a net profit of nearly one million francs. We had planned the use of this money long ago. We all have high ideals, and so do French scientists, because those who don't have high ideals have already stopped being scientists: think about it, the highest hope for a university professor is only an annual salary of 60,000 francs, which is much less than being a doctor or an engineer! So we had already decided to donate all the gold we produced to a scientific research fund, so that every scientist could have the same treatment as other senior professions, and also buy some equipment and publish reports. We also thought of scientists from other countries, Germany, Belgium, Italy, and even your China. Although we don't know much about the treatment of Chinese scientists, we think it must not be very high either. This plan is now completely over! Years of work have been wasted, which is a pity! If you succeed, don't forget our French scientific community!"

"That will never happen," I comforted him.

We knew that this thing could not continue forever, but we hoped that the first few million francs might not attract attention. What about later? Ge Lehua also had his own ideas. He said that the production of goods is faster than gold, the price must fall, and workers must lose their jobs. If gold is produced too quickly, such as 30 million francs a year, then prices must skyrocket, just like in Germany after the European War. So he wanted to produce gold as fast or slow as other goods, the market would be stable, and people could live and work in peace. He often said that this matter was too important. If it were handed over to the French government, they would definitely be greedy and make France a gold-worshipping country, just like Spain conquering Peru and Mexico. It would be better to hand it over to the League of Nations, maybe it would be better.

"Everything went smoothly like this until last autumn. I received a letter from Paris, signed by the International Shareholders' Maintenance Association (VAssocintion Inernatlonal pour la Defensedes Interets Rentiera), with no address. The content of the letter was roughly as follows:

"Dear Sir: Our Association is deeply dissatisfied with the business you are running. If you can give it up, we are willing to pay you 20 million francs for this year.

Your colleagues have all been contacted separately. If you agree, we will send you the salary for the first three months within a week. Enclosed is 10,000 francs to express our Association's sincere intention, which we hope you will check and receive. If you do not understand, then our Association will do its best, and do not say that we did not warn you! Sincerely, Mr. Martin.

International Shareholders' Maintenance Association"

I hesitated for a while when I received this letter. Ten thousand francs can be regarded as being polite first, and when I looked at the letter again three days later, I was really surprised to find that it had turned to ashes. I am a chemist, so of course I can guess the method they used, but this is not a very easy thing. I immediately felt that we had encountered a formidable enemy, not only rich but also capable. Since they had destroyed the evidence, then their threats were probably not entirely bluffing!

### Demonstrations Erupt in the Brazilian Capital to Protest the Submarine Attack on Brazilian Ships. Rumors Spread That Brazil is About to Enter the War.

Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 19th, Havas News Agency Telegram: Following the sinking of Brazilian ships one after another, demonstrations were held here today to protest. The demonstrators were orderly, and the slogans they shouted were purely patriotic. Foreign Minister Aranha asked the public to trust the government and deal with the matter.

Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 18th, Havas News Agency Telegram: Dozens of people, led by university students, held demonstrations on the main streets here today to protest against the successive attacks on five Brazilian ships by submarines of unknown nationality. As of the time of the telegram, no serious incidents had occurred. Only the glass windows of a certain German hotel were smashed by the demonstrators. Sailors have landed ashore and are patrolling the streets with the police to provide special protection for the shops of German and Italian expatriates. After the demonstrators marched, they gathered in front of the presidential palace and petitioned the president. President Vargas immediately stepped onto the balcony, advised the people to remain calm and trust the government, and said that the government has taken all necessary measures and will incorporate the Axis ships being detained into the Brazilian merchant fleet. All foreign spies will also be sentenced to life imprisonment. In addition, demonstrations have also occurred in other important cities in Brazil, such as Cao Polo City, but the order is still good. As for the ships carrying Axis diplomats and expatriates, which were originally scheduled to depart last night, they were unable to sail due to this incident. At the same time, all newspapers are also loudly denouncing, claiming that five Brazilian ships have been sunk one after another, including a troop transport ship, with a total displacement of 13,976 tons. Previously, the Axis submarines attacked Brazilian ships bound for the United States, but at this time, all ships sailing from Brazilian ports to another port in the country were attacked. In addition, the government also issued a statement last night, stating that "This kind of crime of infringing on the lives and property of the Brazilian people cannot but be punished." As for the rescued soldiers on the sunk troop transport ship, they arrived here last night and were warmly welcomed by the public when they landed.

Montevideo, Uruguay, 19th, Havas News Agency Telegram: Foreign Minister Guani recently stated that Uruguay intends to propose to the Pan-American Conference a proposal to protest to the Axis countries regarding the successive attacks on Brazilian ships off the coast of South America. At the same time, it is rumored in political circles here that Brazil will soon enter the war.

### Owner of a House on Avenue Joffre Cuts Off Water Supply. The Authorities Have Taken Action, but the French Police will Not Punish Him Because the Water was Cut Off Before the Decree was Promulgated.

The Shanghai Times reported that the owner of houses No. 11 to 15, Lane 1270, Avenue Joffre, forced tenants to pay rent four times higher than before the circulation of legal tender was stopped, and cut off the water supply from July 20th, which is now nearly a month.

No Water Available in the Hot Summer

As a result, more than 50 tenants in these buildings have no tap water available in this hot summer and have to carry water from outdoors to cook and wash. Although the French Concession authorities have announced that landlords and owners in the concession are not allowed to cut off the supply of water, electricity, and gas to tenants, with fines and imprisonment of up to 5,000 yuan, the tap water in the above-mentioned houses on Avenue Joffre has not been restored as of yesterday afternoon. The tenants have repeatedly appealed to the French Health and Police authorities, but to no avail, so public opinion is quite suspicious.

Supply May Be Restored Within Days

The English-language "Greater Shanghai Daily" also reported that the Deputy Commissioner of the French Concession Police, Li Bailanke, recently told reporters that the French Police are taking action on the matter of the owner of houses No. 11 to 15, Lane 1270, Avenue Joffre, cutting off the water supply, and the water supply there will be restored within days. The police will not punish him this time because the owner of the houses took this action before the French Municipal Council announced the prohibition of cutting off the water supply.

A Warning is Given to Prevent Future Occurrences

However, the police will issue a warning that if the owner takes the same action in the future, he will be subject to imprisonment and a fine of up to 5,000 yuan. This punishment also applies to other owners and sub-landlords. In the past, the French Police have handled many such cases and mostly resolved them amicably. However, from now on, if tenants file a complaint about water being cut off, owners and sub-landlords will face more serious consequences.

### Continued Supply of Butter. Australian Butter is 30 Yuan Per Pound

The Shanghai Municipal Council recently issued Announcement No. 6047, stating that from the 24th to the 29th of this month, butter can be purchased with Butter Allocation Coupon No. 7. The price is set at 30 yuan per pound for Australian butter and 25 yuan per pound for Qingdao butter. Those who hold coupons designated to be sold by Huachang Company should immediately change to purchase from Shanghai Machinery Ice Factory, 153 Nanjing Road. Those who hold coupons designated to be sold by Xingsheng Company should immediately change to purchase from the Joint Department Store, 1 Rue Massenet. Those who hold coupons designated to be sold by Wanxing Company should immediately change to purchase from Tongmao Company, 893 Jing'an Temple Road.

### Matters Concerning Relations: Continuation of Foreign Nationals' Evacuation, Official Negotiations Have Not Yet Started, Hesitation in Deploying Ships

Regarding the mutual exchange of evacuation of Japanese and Allied nationals, which has been underway for three months, more than 1,800 Allied government officials and nationals have been evacuated from various parts of China, and the initial phase has now come to an end. The relevant authorities are still considering the continuation of the evacuation, and formal negotiations have not yet begun. Reports that another ship will depart from the Far East in October to evacuate residents are inaccurate, according to investigations by our reporter. Furthermore, reports that the Conte Verde and Asama Maru will return to Yokohama from South Africa today and soon come to Shanghai to pick up Allied government officials and residents for passage to Lourenço Marques have not been confirmed by Japanese officials. In short, the details of the next evacuation are currently uncertain, and speculation from all parties seems premature.

Factors Determining the Continuation of Evacuation

According to sources among Allied nationals in this port, the relevant governments undoubtedly hope that the ongoing planning for the continuation of the evacuation of nationals will be realized as soon as possible. However, whether it can be realized depends on the following two factors: Each government must provide dedicated ships for the mutual exchange of government officials and nationals for pick-up and drop-off. Currently, there is a high demand for ships due to the war, and it remains to be seen whether ships can continue to be deployed. Considering the previous two evacuations, the UK and the US each provided only one ship, traveling between their respective countries and South Africa, and the capacity was not large. Japan provided a total of four ships. If there are no difficulties in deploying ships for evacuation in the future, the continuation of the evacuation will likely be realized. After the government officials and nationals exchanged in the previous two instances returned to their home countries, they would definitely report to their governments on the treatment they received in the belligerent countries or occupied territories before the evacuation. If the countries concerned believe that the treatment of their government officials and nationals in the belligerent countries is not as satisfactory as desired to protect the happiness of their citizens, they will naturally find ways to have them return home. Conversely, the continuation of the evacuation of government officials and nationals seems unnecessary.

### To Facilitate Residents Traveling to Other Ports, New Citizen Certificates Will Be Issued, Allowing Free Travel to Various Parts of Central China

It is reported that the Shanghai Municipal Government will issue two types of documents, citizen certificates or travel permits, to Chinese residents within the concession aged between twelve and sixty. The issuance of these new certificates is due to the increasing number of residents entering and leaving Shanghai in recent times, making it necessary to conduct checks to facilitate their travel. Holders of the new citizen certificates, even without travel permits, will be allowed to travel freely within the Central China region for both official and business purposes. It is expected that the citizen certificates will be issued within four months, starting from August 15th. By approximately the New Year, most Chinese residents in the urban area will be able to obtain the new citizen certificates. Application forms for the citizen certificates can be obtained from police stations. After completing two copies of the form, they should be submitted to the nearest police station. Applicants must submit three photos. The back of the applicant's photos must be signed by a guarantor to ensure authenticity. Only Baojia heads or those with legitimate occupations may serve as guarantors. The citizen certificate must bear the thumbprints of both thumbs.

Complete Evacuation of Shanghai's Foreign Residents is Impossible

On the other hand, judging from the situation in this port, one cannot expect too much regarding the evacuation of foreign residents. This is because the number of Allied foreign residents in Shanghai is too large, making a complete evacuation impossible. Those who can hope to return to their home countries via evacuation are limited to formal diplomatic and consular officials, as well as prominent gentlemen and merchants who are valued by their governments. Other ordinary foreign residents will likely remain here for a long time. According to investigations by our reporter, the number of Allied foreign residents in Shanghai reaches 12,136, of whom 5,891 are British (including those from affiliated dominions such as Canada and Australia), 1,499 are American, 1,042 are Polish, 383 are Czech, 305 are Greek, 253 are Norwegian, 152 are Dutch, 107 are Belgian, 99 are Yugoslavian, and 2 are Hawaiian, plus 1,847 are Indian and 556 are Filipino. Taking the British and American nationals alone, the number exceeds 7,000. Generally, about half of them have registered to be evacuated. Among other Allied nationals, excluding those of Indian and Filipino籍 who have no urgent reason to evacuate, those who may leave Shanghai to return to their home countries will not exceed half of the total number. Based on the above estimates, at least 5,500 foreign residents in Shanghai are awaiting evacuation. It would be difficult to expect such a large number to be evacuated in the short term. In the previous two rounds of evacuation, only 400 Allied foreign residents from Shanghai were evacuated.

Japanese Side Reveals Implementation at the End of the Year

According to the English-language *Shanghai Times*, the interpreter of the Japanese consulate, Mr. Masaki, revealed yesterday that the governments are currently negotiating the next evacuation issue. It is expected that the mutual exchange of residents between the Japanese side and Western countries will be realized before the end of this year. Masaki also stated that a portion of the foreign residents residing in the occupied areas of China will be selected to come to Shanghai to await evacuation. However, the specific selection criteria were not elaborated upon. It is reported that these foreign residents will receive official notification in the near future.

List of Foreign Residents Leaving Shanghai Announced

It is reported that a total of 3,200 Allied foreign residents have been evacuated from the Far East aboard the Conte Verde, Asama Maru, Tatsuta Maru, and Kamakura Maru. Currently, the Conte Verde and Asama Maru are expected to arrive in Japan within one or two days. The passengers on board are Japanese residents who originally resided in the United States and other American republics. The Japanese mail steamer Kamakura Maru departed last Monday at 5:00 PM, carrying 369 government officials, 330 civilians, and 207 other Allied government officials and residents to Lourenço Marques. The complete list of names has been officially announced by the Japanese side.

### Eighth Ration Distribution to Include Cornmeal

Rice shops priced at 193 yuan and 30 cents per bag. The seventh round of per capita grain distribution implemented by the two concession authorities will end on Saturday, the 22nd. Failure to collect the rations by the deadline will render them invalid. Regarding the distribution of supplementary grains, it was learned from the rice industry yesterday that the Grain Office issued purchase orders for the eighth round to the contracted rice shops the day before yesterday. The flour item has been temporarily suspended and replaced with broken cornmeal, priced at 309 yuan and 30 cents per bag for white rice and 193 yuan and 30 cents per bag for broken cornmeal. The quantities and prices sold by the rice shops will be announced by the local authorities.

### Bank of China and Bank of Communications to Resume Operations Next Month, Full Payment of Deposits After Resumption, Cancellation of Previous Special Operating Rights

After the Sino-Japanese Joint Committee for the Handling of the Bank of China and Bank of Communications Resumption of Operations approved the resumption of operations, preparations for the resumption have been completed. The resumption of operations is scheduled to be announced on September 1st. The capital of the two banks has been converted to Central Reserve Bank notes at a ratio of two to one, with the Bank of China at 20 million yuan and the Bank of Communications at 10 million yuan. For the Bank of China, government and commercial shares are equally divided; for the Bank of Communications, government shares account for 40% and commercial shares account for 60%. Commercial shareholders have been required to register and issue new shares within six months starting from August 1st. The privilege of issuing banknotes by the two banks has been cancelled. At the same time, the special rights of the Bank of China to handle international exchange banking and the Bank of Communications to develop industrial and commercial enterprises will also be cancelled. After the resumption of operations, they will operate as ordinary commercial banks. The headquarters of the Bank of China is located at the corner of Sichuan Road and Hankou Road, and the headquarters of the Bank of Communications is located at the corner of Jing'an Temple Road and Moore Road. The various offices in this port and branches in various parts of Central China will resume operations simultaneously.

The candidates for government and commercial directors, supervisors, and managers have been internally determined and will be announced by the Joint Committee before the resumption of operations.

### Illegally Installing a Telephone Extension is a Crime, Constituting Theft and Two Counts of Fraud

Ye Shengchu, a native of Changzhou and owner of the Flint Lighter Factory at 704 Weihaiwei Road, set up another office in Room 30 of the Zhongshe Apartment at 674 Weihaiwei Road next door. Although the factory had a telephone with number 60249, Ye intended to install a telephone in the office as well, but failed to obtain permission from the telephone company. However, Ye had worked for the telephone company and was very familiar with telephone installation methods. He attached a wire to telephone number 60249 and illegally installed an extension in Room 30 of the Zhongshe Apartment. Recently, this was discovered by the telephone company, which reported it to the Jing'an Temple police station. After investigation by detective Ni Jiafeng and detective Liang Junshan, the facts were verified, and Ye was arrested. He was charged with theft and two counts of fraud, as his actions caused the telephone company to suffer losses in current and fees, and the Public Works Department was unable to collect the new telephone tax. The case was heard yesterday, but further investigation is required, and the hearing was adjourned to a later date.

### Public Concession Police Detective Discovers Sale of Military Weapons, Arms and Ammunition are Leftovers from Gambling Den

Huang Fusen, the detective chief of the Special High Detective Brigade of the Public Concession Police, recently learned that someone was holding military weapons with the intention of selling them. He sent personnel to contact these individuals and arranged to purchase two pistols and five bullets for a price of 2,500 new currency. At 7:30 AM the day before yesterday, the transaction was to take place at the entrance of Yangjia Lane, 497 Weihaiwei Road. Detective Chief Huang immediately dispatched Deputy Detective Xue Youwen, detectives Zhu Shanghe, and Zhou Qingfu to wait in ambush. Soon, Gu Zhengxiang, Zhang Shaoyuan, and a woman from Anhui, Song Jishi, arrived and were arrested by the detectives. A Browning pistol and five bullets were found on the suspects. They were taken back to the police station. It is understood that these arms and ammunition belonged to a Mr. Jia, who worked in a gambling den. The police are currently conducting a strict search for Mr. Jia, and will hand him over together with the other suspects after he is arrested.

### 78 Factories Have Been Returned

The Japanese military authorities have successively returned Chinese-owned factories under the administration of the Japanese military in the Central China region, depending on whether they produce essential goods for people's livelihoods. It is understood that from October 31, 1940, to August 13, 1942, eight rounds of returns have been carried out, including 40 textile factories and 38 other factories, for a total of 78 factories. All have resumed production.

Milk Vendor Fined for Adding Water Illegally

The Public Works Department's Health Department recently discovered that a Chen Zhongren was selling milk privately without a license. The milk was found to be adulterated with water, in violation of regulations. He was handed over to the Special First Court for handling. As a result, on the 18th of this month, he was fined 30 yuan for the adulteration of water, or one month of imprisonment in lieu of the fine, and fined 50 yuan for the private sale as a warning.

### Young Russian Man Dies by Hanging

Yesterday morning at around 2:00 AM, a Russian resident surnamed Jia at 141 Macleod Road, Hongkou, suddenly hanged himself at home. He was discovered and rushed to the Gongji Hospital for treatment, but died.

### Strict Epidemic Prevention, Cold Weather Arrives, Cholera Expected to Be Contained, Mortality Rate Significantly Reduced in the Last Three Days, Widespread Inoculation Has Achieved Good Results

The municipal health authorities have adopted strict preventive measures to prevent the spread of cholera, and have recently achieved results. In the past three days, the number of people infected with the disease and the number of deaths have significantly decreased compared to the previous week.

Inoculation and Disinfection Proceeding Simultaneously

This Monday, there were three cases of cholera in the Public Concession and eight cases in the French Concession. An official from the Health Department stated that the decrease in cholera is due to the strict measures taken by the city and the large-scale inoculation and disinfection efforts. Furthermore, the cooler weather is also a factor. It was also revealed that there were seven cases of cholera in the Public Concession on both Saturday and Sunday. One person died on Saturday, but there were no deaths on Sunday. In the French Concession, there were eight cases on Sunday and ten cases on Saturday. Two people died out of the eight cases on Sunday.

Comparison of Epidemic Situation in Three Areas

At the same time, the total number of cholera cases in the Chinese areas and the two concessions has reached 2,160, of which 1,358 cases occurred in the Chinese areas, with 381 deaths. The total number of cholera cases in the French Concession is higher than in the Public Concession, with a total of 412 cases before and after. The Public Concession has 390 cases. Among them, the French Concession has 96 deaths, and the Public Concession has 73 deaths.

Inspection at Important Intersections Not Relaxed

In addition, the inspection of epidemic prevention certificates in the two concessions has become more widespread in recent days. Police officers and constables are still conducting inspections at important intersections. The number of people inoculated in the two concessions has decreased on Monday, with a total of less than 35,000 people. Among them, 12,441 were inoculated in the Public Concession, and 21,651 were inoculated in the French Concession.

### Vegetable Prices Soar, Price Controls on Food

In view of the fact that traditional Chinese medicine doctors sometimes experience difficulties due to the lack of passage permits when treating urgent illnesses, the Joint Committee of Traditional Chinese Medicine Specialists of this city requested the Public Concession Baojia Guidance Department to issue emergency treatment passage permits to facilitate their service. It has now been learned that the Committee has notified all traditional Chinese medicine doctors in the city to bring their personal chops and two 2-inch photos to the Committee from yesterday until the 24th, from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM each day, to fill out application forms for submission to the Baojia Guidance Department.

### Kidnapper Liu Zongyou Executed by Hanging Yesterday, Previously Involved in Gang Kidnapping for Ransom

Kidnapper Liu Zongyou (36 years old, from Ningbo) and Hu Shinao (also known as Shiyan and Jiang Bingchang, 53 years old, from Ningbo) were involved in a gang kidnapping of Wang Futian from 13, 176 Lane, Chongqing Road on May 16, 1936. They subsequently killed Wang due to unsuccessful ransom negotiations. After the case occurred, the Hongkou police arrested the two criminals Liu and Hu and prosecuted them according to law. The verdict was confirmed, and they were sentenced to death. Hu died in prison from illness in 1940, so only Liu was brought forward to be asked if he had any last words to convey to his family. The criminal looked depressed and shook his head to indicate that he did not need to convey anything and had no last words. He was then ordered to be sent to Nanshi to be executed by hanging according to law.

### University Group and Free Quota Application Deadline Today, Middle School Group List Completed Today, Scholarship Donations Exceed 180,000 Yuan

The Shen Bao Reader Scholarship Fund has completed the publication of the middle school group list today. Payment will begin tomorrow, so please pay attention. The extension of the application deadline for the university group and the free quota for each school will end at 4:30 PM today. At the same time, if there are any more schools donating free quotas, they will no longer be accepted. The supplementary class list will be published soon. The university group is starting to process the review of the list. Yesterday, a 10-year-old elementary school student Wang Jingjun kindly donated 20 yuan to the scholarship fund and attached a letter saying: "Dear gentlemen of the Shen Bao, my tenth birthday is on the 18th of this month. My grandmother loves me very much and wanted to buy me something, but because I didn't want anything, she gave me 20 yuan. A few days ago, my father taught me how to read the newspaper and read a section about the Shen Bao scholarship fund. I wondered whether I should save the money or donate it, so now I am sending the 20 yuan to you. Please include it in the scholarship fund. Sincerely, Wang Jingjun, a fourth-grade student at Fuchun Elementary School, August 16th." We express our utmost respect for this young student and her wise parents. Furthermore, according to the total amount of scholarships published on the 18th, there was a miscalculation of 40 cents (due to the inclusion of the star amount of 624.40 yuan received on the 17th), so the total amount for the 18th should be 179,500.20 yuan (the newspaper reported 179,499.82 yuan). The total amount for the 19th should be 179,988.22 yuan. The current total is 180,008.22 yuan.

### Mother and Daughter Jointly Sue for Forcing Dancer into Prostitution

A woman named Li Xiaomei, over 30 years old, originally from Hangzhou, divorced her husband many years ago and became acquainted with a Zhang, with whom she cohabitated at 53 Tongchun Lane, Shanbaike Road. Zhang did not engage in production and relied solely on raising many young girls, ordering them to work as dancers to earn money, which was pocketed by the Zhang couple. Among the girls she raised was Li Huijun, who was only 18 years old. Her original name was Zhu, and she lost her father at a young age. Her mother handed her over to Li Xiaomei. She had been there for over two years, and Li treated her harshly on a daily basis. The girl had no choice but to endure it. Recently, Li's actions became even more extreme. Because the girl's income from dancing was limited, she wanted to force the girl to become a prostitute. Because the girl refused, she was whipped. The girl's mother, Zhu Lu, works in the countryside and made a special trip to Shanghai to negotiate with Li, wanting to take the girl back, but to no avail. She and her daughter jointly filed a criminal lawsuit against Li and her lover for forcing a good woman into prostitution, which was transferred to the Special First Court. A summons was issued once yesterday, pending further review.

### Thief Assaults Homeowner

Wang Kemin, a broker from Ningbo who lives at 7, 54 Lane, Weiliangmeng Road, French Concession, forgot to close the back door when he went to sleep the night before last at around 2:00 AM, allowing a thief to sneak in. Wang heard a noise upstairs while the thief was stealing things downstairs. He rushed downstairs to investigate and ran into the thief face-to-face. He immediately grabbed the thief, but the thief panicked and used an iron tool to violently beat Wang on the head, nearly causing him to faint. Fortunately, Wang shouted loudly, and neighbors helped to apprehend the thief and hand him over to the police.

Private Changzhou Middle School, located at No. 75 Xieqiao Lane, at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Tongfu Road, has been established for twenty years. After the Incident, it moved to Shanghai and resumed classes in conjunction with Wuxi Normal School. Considering only the graduates of the most recent four years, the number is nearly a thousand. Students in the general course mostly gain admission to famous universities, while those in the normal course are mostly recruited by local and out-of-town elementary schools and educational institutions, almost with demand exceeding supply.

Business News

### Tight Money Supply, Profits Realized, Public Bonds' Decline Difficult to Reverse Temporarily

Yesterday's public bond market was volatile, suddenly trending sharply downwards. This was due to unfavorable conditions causing widespread concern. Moreover, since the bonds had gradually risen from 35 yuan since the late last month, the increase had already exceeded several yuan, so the bulls who had bought earlier were naturally looking to realize their profits at these high prices. Therefore, the outflow of physical bonds was an expected phenomenon. The tighter money supply also hindered the bulls' ability to absorb them. At the beginning of the morning session, selling pressure was strong, with Xinhua, Runde, and Huichang dumping large amounts of bonds, causing prices to fall by three to five jiao or even seven to eight jiao. Although Runli, Lianhe, Shangyuan, and retail investors tried to raise the prices, the market eventually failed to rally due to Shuntai and Qing'an continuing to sell off. As a result, prices fell uniformly by four jiao to one yuan. Judging by the trend, with large investors dumping their holdings, it may be difficult to see a significant turnaround in the short term. If the outflow of bonds decreases and Category B bonds can stabilize around eight yuan, there may be a gradual opportunity for a turnaround. The total turnover was approximately 1.6 to 1.7 million yuan. A table of the prices is listed below.

### Existing Inventory Sold Off, Chinese Stocks Weak and Declining, Xinyi Pharmaceutical Exceptionally Strong, Business Stocks Also Attract Absorption

Yesterday's Chinese stock market was extremely weak and falling, as holders of existing inventory rushed to sell. However, by noon, there was some buying activity at lower prices, and the market had stabilized somewhat. Amidst general uncertainty, the department store Wing On Company broke below 110 yuan, falling by 2.5 yuan. Sincere fell by 4 yuan, and Nanyang Brothers Tobacco also fell by 0.5 yuan. The pharmaceutical company San Ya also saw a low price of 42 yuan. Sino-French fell by 3 yuan. Only Xinyi Pharmaceutical bucked the trend, surging past 800 yuan amidst buying pressure. Among cultural stocks, the Commercial Press was the only one that remained stable, rising by 5 yuan and attracting some absorption. World and China both fell by 2.5 yuan. The Great China Match Company fell by 5 yuan further. Nanyang Brothers Tobacco continued its decline, falling by another 2.9 jiao. Zhabei Water and Electricity fell by a small amount. Chinese Reinsurance rose by another 0.25 jiao, with brisk trading. The stock prices are listed below.

### Silver Shops' Jewelry Gold, Dealers' Mutual Pricing Pushes Up 30 Yuan

Yesterday, the gold market price for jewelry at the Dashin Company and other silver shops in this city was 2,150 yuan for both buying and selling (with a deduction of 350 yuan for buying). The selling price at the cash shops was 2,100 yuan, and the buying price was 1,900 yuan. The dealers' mutual pricing went from weak to strong, with a morning low of 1,855 yuan. Due to a certain rumor, buying activity increased, pushing the price up by 35 yuan to 1,890 yuan, which was the final transaction price. With demand exceeding supply, the price rose by 30 yuan compared to the previous day. The final selling price was above 1,900 yuan, with a difference of 35 yuan. Transactions were not frequent.

As for standard silver ingots, the price remained at 16 yuan per tael, with the dealers' mutual pricing at 10 yuan and 8.9 jiao.

### Military Notes Stable

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw the Japanese military notes remaining quite stable. The dealers' mutual pricing was 51 yuan, 5 jiao, 5 fen, 6.7 li. The buying and selling prices at the retail shops were 5 jiao 5 fen and 6 fen 5 li.

Yesterday, the interbank lending rate announced by the Money Trade Association remained at 1 jiao 6 fen. New banknotes were traded at par with cash. Meifeng heavy woollen cloth was 375 yuan, ordinary riding breeches cloth was sold for 180 yuan to 225 yuan, grass green and navy blue Huate cloth was 200 yuan, 135 fancy cloth was 175 yuan, and 456 was 115 yuan.

### Yarn and Flower Merchants Enter the Market Suddenly, Heavy Cotton Cloth Seen Again

The cloth market's atmosphere continued to rise yesterday, with various cloths seeing price increases again. However, actual sales remained sluggish, so while there were price quotations for coarse and fine cloth, poplin, serge, and bleached cloth, there were few actual transactions. Sixteen-pound Earth brand coarse cloth was 177 yuan, Flying Goose was 175 yuan, Nine-pound New Character was 109 yuan, and Twelve-pound Earth brand fine cloth was 162.5 yuan, with each bolt rising by 2.5 yuan. Three Sheep serge was 5.9 jiao, Volleyball poplin was 4 yuan, with each yard rising by 0.1 jiao. Magnolia bleached cloth was 163.5 yuan, Qin Liangyu was 153 yuan, with each bolt also rising by 1 to 2 yuan. Peach Blossom Ladies' Shirting opened at 159 yuan in the morning, closed at 163.5 yuan at noon, and reached 164 yuan in the afternoon. Ultimately, due to scattered selling, it fell to 162 yuan, rising by 3.25 yuan per bolt compared to the previous day. Xin Fu Factory's Chick Essex cloth, which has consistently sold well, was priced at 254 yuan, rising by 8 yuan per bolt compared to the previous day.

The Eastern cloth market initially rose, then weakened. However, as the noon closing approached, the yarn and flower merchants entered the market suddenly and strongly, pushing prices to a new high. Twelve-pound Dragon Head fine cloth's new orders opened at 180.5 yuan and closed sharply higher at 181.5 yuan, rising by 5 yuan per bolt. Color Ball fine cloth was 166 jiao, Flying Fish was 163 yuan, and Yang Crane was 159 yuan, also rising by over 3 yuan. Four Gentlemen serge's red orders started at 7.3 yuan, twice reaching 7.4 jiao before falling back to 7.367 jiao, fluctuating for a long time. However, the market suddenly tightened at closing, rising sharply to 7.46 jiao.

### New Autumn Weather Gradually Cooling, Woolen Cloth Sales Slowly Improving, Market Sentiment Already Stabilizing

Yesterday's woolen cloth market mostly did not decrease in price, largely because inventory was insufficient. With the new autumn weather already cooling, sales were slowly improving, and market sentiment was able to stabilize, with scattered selling decreasing and some buying activity. The atmosphere in the Zhigong Tea House and Chessboard Street areas gradually improved. Various woolen and cotton fabrics went from weak to stable, and the market showed a slightly firm state. Women's corner goods were even more scarce. This factory's Western suit cloth and Xuanwei cloth were generally quoted at 180 yuan to 225 yuan per yard.

### Vendors' Transportation Inconvenient, Bean Market Firm and Stable as Before, Wuhu Corn Already Being Traded, Sweet Potato Dried Goods Sold Immediately Upon Arrival

The bean market remained stable as before, largely because small vendors were unwilling to sell cheaply due to the difficulty of transportation. However, shops on this street were also unwilling to buy in at excessively high prices, so prices remained relatively flat. Twenty bags of Chongming sand red beans were priced at 162 yuan, and more than ten bags of sand silkworm beans were priced at 120 yuan. Ten bags of Nanjing cowpeas were priced at 162 yuan.

The arrival and inventory of corn were scarce, and trading had been inactive for a long time. Yesterday, fifty bags of Wuhu corn were traded at a price of 108.5 yuan, and the market trend was stable.

Sweet potato dried goods were sold immediately upon arrival, and the market was firm and stable. Yesterday, twenty bags of Jiangbei sweet potato dried grass packages were priced at 108.5 yuan, and thirty bags of single-line bags were priced at 110 yuan to 109 yuan.

Soybean cake and bran were quiet in terms of both supply and demand, and there was no trading.

### Dried Shrimp Spirited and Elegant

Dried shrimp were rare in terms of both arrival and inventory, and market prices continued to rise. Yantai large ones were 750 yuan, mixed goods were 700 yuan, Zhoushan goods were 750 yuan, and Ningbo goods were 550 yuan. The market appeared quite spirited and elegant.

### Soft Cakes Long Out of Stock, Now Arrived

Soft cakes produced in Zhangzhou, known for their softness, stickiness, and fragrance, have been out of stock for a long time. With the Mid-Autumn Festival approaching, Northern merchants are in high demand. Yesterday, it was learned that the Lushan Maru liner had arrived with several thousand pieces. It is rumored that the cost is very high, so the listed price will inevitably increase, and the market trend will be very brisk.

### Incense Sticks Recovering Due to Various Factors, Harmful Goods Not Completely Gone…Hoarding Weakening, Japanese Cigarettes…Distribution

The cigarette market has recently seen a rising trend due to hoarding by various parties. Yesterday, because inferior goods had not completely disappeared from the market, buyers were afraid to swallow large amounts, so hoarding became weak, and prices went from rising to flat. There were also rumors that Japanese factories were distributing goods. As for national cigarettes, such as those from the Nanyang Factory, there was talk of price increases, so the market presented a brewing phenomenon. Yesterday's trading price for Player's Navy Cut was 8,350 yuan to 8,400 yuan, Old Gold was 5,650 yuan, Players Medium Navy Cut was 5,100 yuan, Fairy was 4,300 yuan, Five Flowers was 4,000 yuan. Japanese cigarettes such as Golden Bat were 1,820 yuan, and inferior goods were priced at 1,400 to 1,500 yuan. Golden Gate was 1,250 yuan, Full Luck was 1,95× yuan, Compass was 1,600 yuan. National cigarettes such as Golden Mouse were 3,800 yuan, Beauty was 3,150 yuan, Pyramid was 3,600 yuan. Selling prices generally showed little change.

### Deformed Steel Bars Stagnant

Forty-foot deformed steel bars are not widely circulated in this city. Normally, the market price should soar, but the trend has not been very good. Dealers are also not very keen on holding onto these goods. The market appears to be sluggish, mainly because the construction industry in this city is in decline, and the business of out-of-town customers is slow, resulting in exceptionally quiet transactions. The market is unlikely to flourish, so it is difficult to see a high standard market price, and it is only standing on the stable side. Yesterday, three-point and four-point patterns were sold for 11,500 yuan per ton, while five-point to one-inch goods were priced at around 11,000 yuan. In addition to deformed steel bars, other hardware products also share the same fate, all because sales are quiet, and prices are flat. Currently, Japanese iron hoops are sold for 3,800 yuan per box, small tinplate is 3,200 yuan per box, double-jointed tinplate is 3,400 yuan per box, strip iron is 3,500 yuan per box, black iron billets are 26,000 yuan per ton, malleable lead wire is 3,100 yuan per load, and this factory's nail base is 2,700 yuan per barrel.

### Heaven Never Cuts Off All Hope

— Ou Li

In Kansas City, USA, there lives an obscure, white-haired little old man named McFeatherson. Although he is a disabled person, blind and without arms, living a simple life, he says that he is the happiest person in the world.

He was born in Scotland on February 5, 1866. In his childhood, he played, studied, and grew up like any other child. Later, he got married. In 1883, he took his wife across the ocean to the United States to make a living. In the United States, he worked as a quarryman. One day, while quarrying, the gunpowder unexpectedly exploded prematurely. The force threw McFeatherson thirty feet into the air and then he fell down. When people rushed to help him up, McFeatherson already had no eyes and no arms.

In the eyes of a blind man, the future is, of course, pitch black; but in McFeatherson's eyes, the future was especially bleak. This is because blind people read books by touching them with their fingers, and now McFeatherson didn't even have hands.

But heaven never cuts off all hope. A strong will can overcome major misfortunes and difficulties. McFeatherson was a man with ambition. Although he had no hands, he still had a tongue. But the tongue is an organ for distinguishing tastes and temperatures, and has almost no ability to distinguish shapes. However, McFeatherson used his astonishing, earth-shattering perseverance and determination to use his tongue to begin learning to read. His learning method was completely original. He used his tongue to "touch" the raised letters used for educating people, while his teacher wrote the same letter on the skin of his back between his shoulders, because the skin on the back is more sensitive in distinguishing shapes than the tongue.

Now, McFeatherson is not only able to read, but the speed at which he reads and turns pages is no slower than that of an ordinary person. Although he has suffered the greatest misfortune, after overcoming his misfortune, he is able to live like an ordinary person. He calls himself the happiest person in the world. This happiness did not fall from the sky; it was won by his own strength. (Drawing by Lu Guanghong)

Profession

### Insurance and the Insurance Industry

— Yangtze River

"Insurance" is such a common and popular noun in ordinary conversation, so universally applied.

Since the liquidation and closure of British and American insurance companies in Shanghai due to the impact of the situation, Chinese insurance companies that have risen in their place are the darlings of this era, appearing in various forms like mushrooms after rain.

The insurance business has a history of more than 500 years in various countries around the world. Since the opening of commercial ports in our country, British and American merchants have also brought the insurance business, which is regarded as a method and tool for profit-making, and invaded our country. The types of insurance have also been divided into many categories to suit the complex social life. At present, the main ones are marine insurance, fire insurance, automobile insurance, bicycle insurance, glass insurance, elevator insurance, parcel insurance, hurricane insurance, earthquake insurance, etc. In addition to the above, which take property as the target, there are also life insurance, injury insurance, and death insurance that take life as the object of insurance, as well as relatively rare unemployment insurance and credit insurance.

In Shanghai, the relatively rare and interesting one is "Sunny Weather Insurance." I remember that in December 1934, the American Baseball Association held a grand baseball game in Shanghai. In advance, they insured a considerable amount of "Sunny Weather Insurance" with an American insurance company (American Asia Insurance Company, which has a branch in Shanghai). The insurance rate for this insurance was 10%. The following year (1935), when Japanese world-touring tennis players passed through Shanghai on the Hakone Maru, the Shanghai Tennis Association agreed to hold a grand match at the French Club on Route Mercier when they came ashore in Shanghai. They also insured the same "Sunny Weather Insurance" with the same American insurance company, but this rate was 25%! This is because autumn is more likely to rain than December, and this is determined based on the probability of encountering danger using scientific methods. The insured person's reason for insurance is that in the event of unfortunate rain, the preparatory fees, advertising fees, arrangement fees...and spiritual losses paid for holding the competition can be compensated.

The purpose of insurance is to use the "law of averages" to have various individual losses shared and borne equally by everyone. This principle is very reasonable. In theory, people with the same interests should jointly organize insurance institutions and handle mutual insurance matters. However, in this kind of society, this insurance business is of course inevitably commercialized! This link, which was originally a part of the public welfare cause of the social masses, is now regarded as a tool for making profits, and the original meaning of pure and supreme insurance, of course, also decreases or disappears with it!

For example, the newly emerging bicycle insurance is rising relative to automobile insurance. In Shanghai, since a Portuguese merchant insurance company selected it as a business opportunity half a year ago, many companies have followed suit and organized it speculatively. Up to now, the results are unexpectedly lacking in vitality. The reason is, of course, that the ultimate goal of insurance companies is to make profits, so the insurance premiums are extremely high, averaging a maximum of 13.7%—this is due to poor management and the high probability of theft and damage—therefore, if it can be organized by car owners jointly to maintain their mutual interests, the situation will definitely change.

In various countries around the world, there are many insurance businesses organized by the government or by the public jointly. The purpose is to protect the rights and interests of the social public. For example, after the outbreak of the European War this time, the British Admiralty ordered all merchant ships in the country to join the "Wartime Marine Risk Insurance." There are also "Conscription Insurance" held by many countries during wartime, and Japan's "Earthquake Insurance," etc., which are all relatively reasonable and progressive systems. In our country, it has not yet been created.

If the nature of the insurance organization in which employees of insurance companies serve is purely to protect the public interest, then they are certainly worthy of admiration as public servants of the masses. But in commercialized insurance organizations, although they are in contact with "insurance policies" every day and hear words such as "reducing the possibility of loss and damage" and "avoiding damage" all day long, most of them cannot even participate in "unemployment insurance" and enjoy the true rights of insurance themselves.

"Only a insurance organization with a pure nature can give full play to the true purpose and mission of insurance!" This is what I, no, every member of society, deeply feels.

### Young Ladies Learning

— Pan Shuxian

(2) Between Teachers and Students

Many years ago, it was very rare to hire a young male teacher at a relatively conservative church girls' school. Even if one was hired, one would first inquire whether he was already married. And when he was teaching, other female teachers often sat in the back to supervise, in order to show prudence. Even today, female teachers still make up the majority of teachers in church girls' schools, but now it is no longer because of suspicions such as "men and women should not touch hands when giving and receiving." The biggest reason is still for life. The monthly "dongxiu" given to teachers by church girls' schools is often quite meager. It is really difficult for a male teacher with a wife and children to support a family with this little money; while most female teachers do not need to support a family, and many even have their accommodation and meals covered by their fathers and brothers, so a salary of one or two hundred yuan is of course more than enough for spending money. Especially in the past year or two, as life has become more and more difficult, male teachers have all found other "high positions" one after another, and the vacancies left behind have all been given to female teachers.

Female teachers can also be divided into several categories: old maids, widows, and young ladies. Among them, old maids and young ladies account for the majority, and widows are fewer, and married women with families and children are even rarer. Old maids have often served in the school for ten or twenty years. The school has become their home, and the students are like their own children. Although many have strange tempers, their scolding is often out of kindness and enthusiasm, which is better than irresponsible teachers who teach for a few dollars an hour; and not every old maid has an "old maid's temper." Many old maids are able to maintain their vigor because they are with young children every day; years of experience have also enabled them to deeply understand the psychology of young girls, making them lovable old women. They are truly devout people who "commit themselves to education."

Young female teachers are often new teachers who have just graduated from university. They have more enthusiasm than experience. If they cannot solve the many difficult problems they encounter when they first enter the profession, they will become stern teachers who resent their profession; otherwise, they are often very popular with students.

In terms of teacher-student relations, everyone must admit that church schools, especially church girls' schools, are superior to other types of schools. Teachers do not run to the office to hide as if they have been pardoned as soon as they hear the end-of-class bell, and students seem to have known since ancient times that they do not have to be afraid of teachers after class; so after the break, teachers often mingle with students, talking and laughing. The younger ones even play ball, ride bicycles, and even fight with the students. When students have some personal problems, sometimes their admired teachers can know before their parents, in addition to her best friend. However, there is one phenomenon that is quite abnormal: that is "homosexual love." Students pursue teachers, and lower-grade students pursue upper-grade students. After successfully forming two pairs of so-called "friends" with wrong meanings, they will become as close as glue and lacquer. Whenever they have time, they will hide in a place where no one is around to talk, and they often have to write letters even though they meet every day, and they absolutely do not allow themselves to think about "all men are brothers within the four seas." If one party has a new friend, the other will cry and make trouble, causing a storm. When students have nothing to do after class, they like to "argue with friends" for fun. Some will even remain unmarried for life because they are too close to their "friends." Therefore, those with clearer minds often try their best to avoid "pursuit" in order to avoid making a mess.

### Nightmare

— He Kai

Even if you are someone who sleeps through the night and never dreams, you will have suffered from nightmares a few times in your life. Then, I believe you will definitely sympathize with one of my friends.

When I saw him a few days ago in the morning, he seemed a little haggard. According to him, he had a terrible dream the night before. In a daze, as he was walking on the road, he suddenly discovered that a tiger was walking beside him. What followed was a continuous string of terror until finally he suddenly realized that there was no road at all, and he was walking in a void. This shock was extraordinary. He began to fall from above, falling all the way into a deep abyss that was dozens of feet deep. Finally, he felt a heavy blow, and when he woke up, he realized it was the floor of his bedroom!

He told me that he had never felt more alive than at this moment of awakening. I completely believe him; similarly, I believe that many of us live our lives in dreams, never waking up, dispersing unpleasant illusions.

Dreams are products of imagination, and once the dawn of "reason" breaks, they vanish into nothing.

I firmly believe that many of our terrible imaginations and fears will also disappear if we can recognize our own abilities, if we can open our eyes and see the other paths leading to clear-headed judgment and sound design.

Many people lead very confused lives, so like my friend who suffered from a nightmare, they never consider carefully when the road they are walking on will suddenly disappear from under their feet, or whether the little things they cherish will suddenly turn into tigers that threaten their happiness and peace of mind.

Considering your life, and designing your life, is indeed the only way to turn pleasant dreams into reality, and to drive nightmares into the night of yesterday.

Miscellaneous Thoughts

### The Cage

— Sun Jia

I visited the zoo.

A large group of people surrounded the iron cage, watching the black bear pacing back and forth inside. People shouted, looking at its foolish appearance: stretching out its originally short and thick neck, opening its mouth greedily and approaching the wire mesh fence, waiting for the peanuts to be thrown in. People teasingly waved the hand holding the peanuts, tempting it. The mouth opened even wider, the body leaned in even closer, until finally the desire to play with it was satisfied, and the peanuts were thrown in as if a reward. The black bear then began its exhaustive pacing again, pacing back and forth, quietly awaiting people's teasing and peanuts. Ah, the world in the cage! It will spend its entire life pacing back and forth foolishly like this.

Black bear! Have you forgotten the mountains and forests, the flying springs, the life of free running?

### Sharing the Same Boat in Storms

— He Jia Zhi

(Eight) What to Do?

Mrs. Ye Er said, "Didn't you say some time ago that Miss Chen was studying nursing? Is she still studying nursing?" Wei Cheng said, "According to her, there are too many things to learn. She held my hand and asked me to forgive her. She was also afraid that I would be angry, saying that today's answer was not the final answer yet. Tomorrow I will give you a final answer. I stayed in the hotel for two nights. She came alone on the first day, and Guoqi came with her on the second day. On the second day, what they said at first was unimportant. In the end, Guofang gave me the final answer. Just one sentence: Our friendship still exists. Guoqi said: If father's illness can get better, we might return to Shuangqiao at the end of the year or the beginning of next year. We hope you can come to Shuangqiao. Aunt, what was said has reached this point, and it is completely contrary to my original intention of coming to Shuangqiao and Shanghai. I can no longer stay in Shanghai."

Mrs. Ye Er said, "If that's the case, then there's no need to talk about Miss Chen's marriage anymore. But you don't have to be angry, and you don't have to be discouraged." Wei Cheng said, "My marriage problem was originally one thing that involved this other matter. This marriage cannot be forced on anyone. Like me, I rashly proposed to someone before I had reached maturity, and that was already wrong. If I were to force someone again, that would be even more wrong. I will absolutely not be angry, nor will I be discouraged. Mrs. Ye Er said, "Let me think about it carefully, and I will talk to you again tomorrow. You go back to your room and sleep now. Will you catch a cold walking through the courtyard?" Wei Cheng stood up and said, "I won't catch a cold. I didn't wear fewer clothes." He went to open the door, stepped one foot outside, but immediately pulled it back, walked to Mrs. Ye Er again, and smiled, "Aunt, you don't need to think about it carefully.
