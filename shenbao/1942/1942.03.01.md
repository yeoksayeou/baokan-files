Tokyo, 28th (Domei News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 4:45 PM today that at dawn on February 24th, an enemy fleet consisting of one aircraft carrier, two cruisers, and six destroyers attempted to attack Daitori Island (formerly Wake Island). They were repelled by the island's Japanese naval coastal artillery. One enemy cruiser caught fire, and one destroyer was hit in the stern, suffering heavy damage. One enemy large cruiser was bombed by Japanese aircraft, sustaining heavy damage to its rear deck. In the engagement between enemy aircraft and Japanese defending aircraft, five enemy aircraft were shot down. As the enemy fleet approached a point where it was heavily attacked by the Japanese Navy, it fled. One Japanese patrol boat sank, and military installations on the island sustained slight damage, with a few casualties.

Tokyo, 28th (Domei News Agency dispatch) - The Nichi Nichi Shimbun reports that enemy ships sailed out of Batavia yesterday, including three Dutch 3,000-ton warships, which were hit by bombs dropped by Japanese army aircraft in the Sunda Strait.

Tokyo, 28th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - According to a military reporter for the Yomiuri Shimbun, if Japan can control the Bismarck Archipelago and Timor Island, any attempt by the US fleet to attack Japan from New Zealand and Australia will inevitably fail, and US aircraft carriers will also be sunk. Although Darwin and Port Moresby can be used as US naval bases, it will not be difficult for Japan to control Sydney, Melbourne, Newcastle, and Adelaide. If the US Air Force attempts to attack Japan from Alaska and the Aleutian Islands in the north, the US will risk its entire fleet, and there is still no hope of victory.

### France Offers Guarantees to the US, Reaffirming Neutrality Policy; US Still Awaits Further French Explanation on Security of French Territories

Washington, 28th (Reuters dispatch) - President Roosevelt told reporters yesterday afternoon that a Paris radio report claimed that US Ambassador to France Leahy had requested the French government to notify the US government in advance of the movements of its fleet, but Vichy had refused. However, according to the State Department's Intelligence Division, this propaganda is not true. In addition, the State Department issued a statement last night stating that the French government had presented a note to US Ambassador Leahy last Tuesday, reaffirming its neutrality policy. As for other important issues, the US government is still awaiting further explanation from the French government (it is understood that the so-called important issues refer to the security of Madagascar Island and French territories in Africa in the Indian Ocean). The statement also stated that President Roosevelt had sent a letter to Marshal Petain on February 10, stating that the US government had received reports that there would be contacts from mainland France to ship goods to North Africa for use by the Axis forces in Libya, and that he firmly believed that any assistance to the enemies of the American people was not what the French people wanted, and was also detrimental to the wishes of the French people. Marshal Petain replied that the French government would not provide any military assistance to any belligerent country in any theater of war. This statement was issued after lengthy discussions by the State Department, and its wording served as a final public warning from the United States to the Vichy government, and as a public assurance to the United States that the Vichy government would not go beyond the scope of the armistice agreement to aid the Axis powers.

Welles' Remarks

Washington, 27th (Havas News Agency dispatch) - Under Secretary of State Welles stated that the French government has provided new guarantees to the United States that any actions that would undermine its neutral status will be avoided and that it does not intend to provide military assistance to any belligerent country.

It is reported that President Roosevelt warned France on the 10th of this month that if it supplied the Axis powers with military equipment or supplies, it would place itself among the enemies of the United States. The guarantees made by the French government now are in response to this warning.

### Lyon Supreme Court Continues Third and Fourth Sessions; Trial of National Traitors Daladier and Others

Lyon, 27th (Havas News Agency dispatch) - The Lyon Supreme Court opened its third session at 2:30 PM today to try national traitors. First, the President of the Court, Caous, read out the Supreme Court's documents, answering one by one the opinions put forward by the lawyers of the defendants. Then, Daladier was interrogated. Caous once again listed Daladier's crimes: That France failed to adequately prepare for war; That the Cabinet's attitude was ambiguous when discussing whether France had the strength to militarily intervene in the European situation on August 23, 1939; That Daladier only attended one cabinet meeting during this critical period. Daladier immediately replied, "According to French law, the Minister of the Army chairs the cabinet meetings when discussing issues related to the army's organization. During my tenure, the number of reservists called up into the army increased every year. In 1933, there were only 258,000, but by 1938, it had increased to 511,000. As for the issue of military equipment, I allocated huge sums of money to finance the production of military equipment. France's failure to have sufficient tanks is not my responsibility, but should be borne by others. I requested Parliament to allocate a total of 6.2 billion francs and did my best to increase the country's industrial output." Court President Caous stated that the government ordered 800,000 rifles from various munitions factories, but only 85,000 had been delivered by August 1, 1939. As far as I know, the government only ordered 157,000 rifles, and 101,000 were delivered by August 1, 1939 (at this point, another defendant, the former Director-General of Munitions Jacomet, interjected, emphasizing that the implementation of the rearmament plan by January 1, 1937, was actually six months ahead of schedule). As for the production of various military equipment, I proposed the formation of "mechanized divisions." The German army used these divisions as the vanguard of armored divisions. The production of 30-ton tanks was also my initiative. However, the General Staff did not pay attention to this. Senior generals such as Billotte and Doumenc did not use tanks according to the principles advocated by experts before the war. At this point, the prosecutor inquired about the military equipment manufacturing matter. Daladier replied in a evasive manner, "France's mobilization was not hampered by the lack of military equipment. The military equipment that I stipulated to be supplied to the army was more than what was stipulated in the mobilization plan." The court then adjourned at 5:45 PM and scheduled to open the fourth session tomorrow.

### Wavell on Generalship (7)

A general's losing his temper with his subordinates does not necessarily harm his reputation or cause him to lose their faith; for familiarity breeds contempt, and (as someone wittily put it, "the licensed temper of senior officers"), and except for those directly involved, subordinates will not bear him a grudge, and sometimes even show respect for him as a result. However, the sarcasm of a superior is most hated and remembered by his subordinates. In the Iberian Peninsula campaign, the distinguished and eccentric light cavalry commander Craufurd was more feared by the soldiers than the rude and boisterous Picton, for the former spoke with sharp words, containing sarcasm and irony, while the latter merely roared when angry.

Should a senior commander have a sense of humor? Although a sense of humor is beneficial to anyone, it must not be overused. In fact, many famous generals throughout history have not had a sense of humor. Allenby certainly had a sense of humor, but others did not dare to joke with him casually. He only revealed this emotion after retiring from public life. Wellington was the same. I don't think Haig had a sense of humor; I couldn't find a trace of it in Napoleon either. Only that eccentric Russian genius Suvorov can be considered a consistently humorous person; but rather than calling him a humorist, it would be more accurate to call him a braggart.

On the other hand, British soldiers can be called one of the world's great humorists. After the last Great War, the humorless Germans conducted research into the causes of morale, and concluded that the endurance of the Allies was mostly due to a sense of humor. Therefore, they decided to instill a sense of humor into the minds of German soldiers, and military textbooks also contained orders to cultivate a sense of humor, with an example of a cartoon by Bruce Bairnsfather, depicting "Old Bill" sitting next to a house, with a huge shell hole in the wall, and a new comrade asking, "How did this happen?" Old Bill replied, "Mice did it," with a solemn note added below: "It wasn't mice, it was a shell."

I have rambled on for a long time, and I am afraid I have not contributed much to you. What I am trying to tell you is that the entire history of war is a living event with flesh and blood, not just some charts or norms; nor is it just a struggle between machines and machines, but a struggle between people and people. In a French infantry school I once visited, there were a few words from Du Picq in the large lecture hall: "Man is the first weapon of war; let us study the soldiers in wartime, because it is these people who make the war happen. Only by studying the past can we gain a sense of reality and know how to fight in the future."

If you study the history of war, you don't have to read strategic outlines or principles of war, you should read biographies, chronicles, and historical novels such as "Paths of Glory" or "La Chartreuse de Parme." What we need to study is the living history of war with flesh and blood, not its dry bones. Knowing that Napoleon! The campaign of 1796 was won by using interior lines of operation. Or similar names, have little use. If you can know how an unknown young man inspires a broken, hungry, and demoralized army to bravely move forward and fight hard, and how he suppresses senior generals with more experience and age, forcing them to obey his orders, then you can say that you have learned something. Napoleon was able to dominate the world mostly because he understood human nature in wartime, not just by memorizing a few rules or strategies. From an anecdote from his early years, we can see that he understood psychology very well. When Napoleon was an artillery officer, he built a battery in a completely exposed place during the Siege of Toulon. Those around him thought that no gunners would be willing to guard it. So he hung a sign at the edge of the battery, writing "Battery for those who are not afraid to die," and soldiers went forward one after another to guard it.

To summarize the above points, I believe that all successful commanders, in their relationship with their subordinates, should adhere to the following principles: A general must maintain strict discipline, but must not be overly harsh.

### Scenery of Batavia City

Batavia is divided into two areas, old and new. The old area is called the Old City or "Oud Batavia", while the new area is called Weltevreden. Because the old city is humid, government offices and European residences are located in the new area, which is a "garden city" with wide streets, shady trees, elegant houses, and fresh air. Weltevreden means "well content". The streets in the old district are narrower and the houses are more simple and old. However, foreign trading houses, banks, and warehouses are still located here. (Top picture) is Senen Street in the old district, with the De Javasche Bank building on the side. (Bottom picture) is the Tjiliwong River in the center of the old district, with clear waters and village women washing clothes, its style resembling the Washing Silk Stream in Hangzhou. According to yesterday's dispatches, a large-scale air battle took place over Batavia. The residents of both these new and old districts must have suffered a great deal of terror.

### Amendment to Land Regulations and Bylaws: Storing Goods Requires a License; Operating Various Businesses Requires Prior Licensing and the Bureau May Stipulate Terms and Collect Deposits

The Shanghai Municipal Council has received notification from the Senior Consul that Article 53 of the Land Regulations Bylaws has been approved for amendment, changing the phrase "any goods that are retailed and subject to price control announced by the Municipal Council at any time" to "any goods that are bought, sold, or stored and subject to price control announced by the Municipal Council at any time." The amended text of the said bylaw is as follows:

Regulations for Operating Controlled Goods

"Any individual, partnership, or company that buys, sells, or stores any goods subject to price control announced by the Municipal Council at any time shall comply with the rules published by the Municipal Council regarding recording the quantity of such goods stored and the location of storage, or regarding the selling price. Any individual, partnership, or company that violates any provision contained in the rules promulgated by the Municipal Council in accordance with this bylaw shall be subject to 'A' the penalties prescribed in Article 17 of the Land Regulations, or other sanctions deemed fair by the competent court, or 'B' have the license issued to the individual, partnership, or company suspended or revoked by the Municipal Council, or both (A) and (B) may be implemented simultaneously." The bureau has already announced this yesterday for general knowledge.

Various Businesses Must Obtain Licenses

Furthermore, within the bureau's Announcement No. 5802, it is stated that the bureau has received notification from the Senior Consul that Article 34 of the Land Regulations Bylaws has been approved for amendment, adding the storage of goods in godowns, warehouses, and other places to the list of items requiring a license. The amended text stipulates that opening factories, storing goods, or opening markets, entertainment venues, restaurants, hotels, pawnshops, money exchanges, food stores, land and water transportation, etc., within the settlement requires a license. Foreign licenses must be countersigned by the consul, and terms may be stipulated and deposits collected at discretion. (The amended bylaw can be found in today's advertisement in this newspaper.)

### Authorities Plan to Lower Meat Prices

The price of meat in the city soared by 75% during the Lunar New Year. The authorities of the International Settlement and the French Concession have begun investigating the possibility of lowering prices. The Shanghai Municipal Council and the French Municipal Council have not specifically established any committees to conduct this investigation; rather, it is being handled by the price control groups from each of the two bureaus. Before taking action to lower meat prices, it must be determined whether the increase is due to circumstances or illegal profiteering. The claim that the soaring meat prices are due to the closure of slaughterhouses during the Lunar New Year holiday is inaccurate. It is claimed that 16/10 of the meat consumed in the city comes from cold storage, and is not entirely dependent on slaughterhouses. At the same time, there was no significant change in meat prices yesterday.

### Revised Figures for Workers' Cost of Living in February

In February of this year, the general index of the cost of living for Chinese workers in this city reached 1468.93, an increase of 11.70% compared to January. Among the classified indices, except for a slight decrease of 1.52% in the housing category, the food and miscellaneous categories rose by 15.66% and 16.80%, respectively. The miscellaneous category index has exceeded the 2000 mark.

The selling price of foreign rice increased three times this month, and the amount sold each time was repeatedly reduced. On the 2nd of this month, the limit was two sheng per purchase, at a price of three yuan. On the 9th, it was one sheng per purchase, for one yuan and six jiao. On the 23rd, it increased again to one yuan and seven jiao. Starting from the 7th, the movement of "du mi" rice was not allowed to exceed two dou. The retail prices of goods soared this month. In the food category of this index, out of 30 items, 25 increased in price. In the clothing category, out of 11 items, 6 increased in price. In the housing category, the decrease in the price of waste firewood was greater than the increase in the price of matches, so the index decreased slightly. Soap and cigarettes rose sharply in price. The average prices of some major items this month are compared with those of last month to show a glimpse of the changes.

Item Name　　Percentage Increase/Decrease　　Foreign Rice　　+ 15.43　　Soybean Sprouts　　+ 30.19

### Huangsha Merchant Defrauded of Payment for Gasoline

Dai Xiatai, the owner of Ye He Ji at No. 19 Rongchang Lane, Huade Road, Pudong, reported to the French Concession police the day before yesterday that he is a merchant who deals in yellow sand, gravel, and contracting for road construction materials and needs gasoline. On January 11 of this year, he met a friend, Wang Chengfa, who claimed that his friends Chen Zhongyu, Chen Changlin, Xiao Zhenhua, etc., had a large quantity of gasoline for sale at home. The merchant believed him and contacted Wang to order 100 gallons of gasoline, priced at 2,400 yuan. On the afternoon of the 13th, he went with Wang to Li Fa Fruit Store on Xiaodongmen Street and paid the full amount of the goods to Wang et al., and obtained a receipt from Li Fa as proof. At that time, it was stated that the goods would be delivered the next day. Unexpectedly, the goods were not delivered afterward. When he contacted them, they kept making excuses. The merchant found out that Wang et al. were opening Room 19 at the Gongping Hotel on Avenue Edward VII, specializing in defrauding people. Therefore, he went to Wang to demand the return of the payment, but they accused the merchant of extortion. Therefore, this case was reported for investigation. After receiving the report, the police chief sent detectives to arrest the above four people. According to the interrogation of Wang and the two Chens and Xiao, the four people were duped by Lin A'er and a person surnamed Hu, who are at large. The rest of the statements were evasive. They were ordered to be detained for further investigation and handling.

### Public Notice from the French Concession Administration Regarding Gas Poisoning, Urging Immediate Reporting to the Fire Department

The extraction of items from safe deposit boxes will be handled in accordance with the previously announced procedures. There are still many safe deposit boxes at this bank, so the number of renters applying is quite crowded.

Starting yesterday, a branch payment counter has been set up at the treasury department of the head office on Jiujiang Road to handle payments for branch depositors.

### Allied Banks Continue to Process Withdrawals; Banque Belge pour l'Etranger Makes Third Payment

Most Allied banks in this city are currently continuing to pay depositors with the second batch of deposits. However, Banque Belge pour l'Etranger has been disbursing the third batch of deposits since February 1. The procedure for the second batch of payments at other Allied banks is to allow withdrawals of half of the remaining amount after deducting the first 2,000 yuan. Banque Belge pour l'Etranger is different, limiting the second batch to 30% and paying another 20% in the third batch. Furthermore, according to disclosures from HSBC and Citibank, no merchant firms have yet been granted permission to claim maintenance fees. An HSBC employee stated that all bank operations remain unchanged and that the safe deposit boxes are still open in accordance with the established regulations. However, there is no word on whether the bank will soon disburse the third batch of deposits. Currently, only Chase Bank is still paying depositors with the first batch of deposits. The bank allows depositors to withdraw a maximum of 2,000 yuan from personal and company accounts as of December 6, and the safe deposit boxes have also been opened.

Jù Kāng Settlement will follow on the 23rd, and Dà Lài Settlement has already gone public on the 25th, making a total of fifty-two firms. As for Đồng Dư Yǒngjì Settlement, initially, due to differing opinions among shareholders, it was planned to change its business registration and choose an auspicious date to go public. However, it was later discovered that the accounts were in disarray and it was impossible to continue operations. A lawyer was entrusted to announce liquidation. Yesterday, a certain newspaper reported that the settlement was scheduled to continue going public yesterday, which seems inaccurate.

### Public Debt Interest Division Becomes Focus of Buying and Selling Dispute

Yesterday, the public debt grey market continued its downward trend, with sellers being extremely active. It is rumored that the 12th interest coupon will soon be divided for buying and selling, but there is no agency in Shanghai to pay the interest coupon. If the division is calculated, the holder of the interest coupon is equivalent to being stuck with it. Moreover, if the market price is calculated with the interest division, it will inevitably decrease by about two or three yuan. This is another point of competition between the bulls and the bears. The buyers are willing to divide the interest coupon and reduce the market price slightly, while the bears are unwilling to divide the interest coupon and sell at a lower market price. However, the old bears are satisfied because the interest coupon, which cannot be paid in cash, has already been sold at a price. When it is replenished in the future, it is as if the price of the interest coupon has already been received. This is the focus of the dispute. However, regardless, it is generally believed that after the announcement of the winning numbers for the 13th Type A lottery bond, buying and selling will reasonably be based on the division of interest coupons. Therefore, yesterday, sellers such as Dà Zhōng, Héng Kāng, Dà Kāngchéng, Shùn Tài, Tóng Kāng, Héng Kāng, and Yù Xīng sold off one after another. Liánhé, Tóng Xīng, Xié Kāng, Rùn Dé, and retail investors covered their short positions, but it was difficult to reverse the downward trend. The market price fell directly by more than one to more than two yuan. There is temporarily no sign of recovery. The trading volume was about 400,000 to 500,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.

### Japanese Yarn Price Rises Significantly

The cotton yarn market continued to rise, and the upward trend was very strong. However, Chinese yarn was mediocre. The initial opening price for 20-count Double Horse Factory single yarn was 2,225 yuan, rising to 2,295 yuan, and then falling back slightly, with a price of 2,275 yuan. 42-count Blue Phoenix rose sharply by 200 yuan, with the initial trading price at 5,200 yuan, rising to 5,400 yuan. 32-count Blue Phoenix was 4,210 yuan, 32-count Fairy Peach was 4,610 yuan, 32-count Golden Star was 4,100 yuan, 32-count Collecting Sheep was 4,000 yuan to 4,150 yuan, 32-count Red Joy was 4,250 yuan, 20-count Moon Qin was 2,800 yuan, 20-count Water Moon was 3,000 yuan, Blue Phoenix was 3,050 yuan, 20-count Double Earth was 2,540 yuan, 20-count Double Tiger was 2,850 yuan, 23-count Golden Rooster was 2,620 yuan, and 10-count Red Double Horse was 1,200 yuan.

### Fellow Traders and Speculators Drive Cotton Cloth Prices Up Without End

Factory cloth prices also tracked upwards yesterday due to the sharp rise in East Piece goods. White goods, both coarse and fine cloth, gradually increased in price, rising by two to three yuan per piece. 16-pound Earth coarse cloth was 115 yuan, Flying Swan was 107 yuan, 8-pound Zhenzhong was 64 yuan, and 12-pound Dapeng fine cloth was 100 yuan, and Fugui was 98 yuan. Earth fine cloth was 104 yuan, and trading was open. However, 16-pound Flower Butterfly coarse cloth was still quoted at 126 yuan, and Double Elephant was 124 yuan. Blue cloth poplin continued to rise uniformly, with Peach Blossom Ladies' Lawn at 172 yuan, White Cat print cloth at 95 yuan, and Three Sheep strip poplin at 4 yuan 4 jiao. Longevity poplin at 4 yuan 4 jiao and a half was extremely scarce.

The upward trend in East cloth continued fiercely without end. Yesterday, the leading fine cloth factory order opened at 116 yuan and 5 jiao. Fellow traders and speculators pushed it up, driving it to a peak of 119 yuan and 5 jiao at closing. It rose sharply by 5 yuan and a half per piece. Spot and bank orders traded from 107 yuan to 110 yuan. Flying Fish colored balls rose to 110 yuan and 5 jiao, Yang Crane was 110 yuan, and Trumpet Five Blessings was 108 yuan. The rise in fine twill was relatively slow. Five Blessings Blue Double Fish traded at 100 yuan, and Baby was 98 yuan and 5 jiao. The new order for Jiao Junzi drill was quoted at 3 yuan 8 jiao 8 fen at noon, and the July to September orders were 3 yuan 7 jiao 3 fen. The spot market was mediocre, at only 3 yuan 7 jiao 1 fen.

### Edible Oil Supply Gradually Improves

In recent months, the edible oil market in this city suddenly showed signs of panic. This was because the supply was restricted and the source was delayed due to insufficient shipping capacity. Some sauce and oil workshops stopped selling, while others mixed inferior oil and sold it at high prices. During the frying process, the odor was abnormal. It was not until the day before yesterday that oil was seen for sale in various oil workshops. Each person was limited to purchasing one market catty, and some limited each person to only one yuan. The official prices were: raw oil at 3 yuan 3 jiao and a half per market catty, soybean oil at 3 yuan 2 jiao and a half, clear oil and rapeseed oil at 3 yuan 1 jiao. It is also heard that 1,300 tons of raw oil from Qingdao and 5,000 tons of Dà Sù soybean oil that were previously ordered have arrived in port with 600 barrels yesterday, and the rest are being shipped to Shanghai. If this can be realized, the panic may be eliminated, but it still depends on the business ethics of the oil and sauce industry.

### Coarse Grains Slightly Sold Off at High Prices

Because corn will soon be sold under unified control, buyers flocked to purchase corn flour yesterday. In places with a larger number of buyers, they also had to queue up to buy. It was sold for one yuan and one market catty, which was still coarse flour. Some were mixed with stone powder, which was simply harming people. But buying corn flour in the future will be like buying rice, so it is no wonder that buyers were crowded yesterday.

Red beans were thinly traded and prices were weak. Yesterday, about 100 bags of Chongming sand red beans were sold from scattered stockpiles, with prices ranging from 136 yuan and a half to 134 yuan, which was two to three yuan lower than before.

Sesame was scarce and uniquely sought after. Yesterday, over 100 bags of Kaiming Guangxue sesame were sold, with a price of 228 yuan.

Soybean cake stockpilers sold more and bought less, and the market trend turned weak. Yesterday, 500 pieces of Kaili Character soybean cake warehouse orders for June were sold, with a price of 34 yuan. 1,000 pieces of Changji soybean cake warehouse orders for May were priced at 31 yuan to 30 yuan. 1,000 pieces of Hankou soybean cake were priced at 29 yuan. 5,000 pieces of Shenji soybean cake for May were priced at 36 yuan and a half, for June at 39 yuan to 37 yuan, for July at 37 yuan and a half, and new warehouse orders for February were priced at 42 yuan to 41 yuan 8 jiao.

The market for yellow soybeans was weak for both stockpilers and sellers yesterday, with only scattered transactions. The market was flat and weak. It is estimated that 100 bags of Tianjin Jinyuan were sold, priced at 175 yuan. 50 bags of Wuhu yellow soybeans were priced at 155 yuan. 194 bags of Sangyuan yellow soybeans were priced at 159 yuan. 154 bags of Pinghu Dù beans were priced at 169 yuan.

After successive sharp increases in bran prices in recent days, it has aroused the desire of holders to sell off at high prices. New stockpilers have lost their appetite. Yesterday, only a few rural villages and domestic distributors slightly purchased at flat prices. However, orchid guest bran, priced at 67 yuan, was still unsalable, while the early market price of 68 yuan 6 jiao and 8 fen for Sanxin large bag bran had fallen to 68 yuan 4 jiao in the afternoon, and the final price was 68 yuan, which was one yuan less than the previous market.

### Southern Japonica Rice Slightly Recovers, Northern Japonica Rice Remains Firm

Although Southern japonica rice returned to flat yesterday, northern japonica rice was scarce and high-quality goods were instead raised. Kunxi special japonica rice opened at 295 yuan to 293 yuan and was moving towards the peak of 300 yuan again. However, due to continuous sunny days, the arrival of early round rice from the southern route in the nearby suburbs slightly increased, and due to the excessive price, the appetite of buyers weakened. Holders also sought to sell off at high prices, so there were declines of three to four yuan in both the morning and evening. Southern Gang Yinyuan was also brought in due to high prices, and the upward trend had been thwarted. Yesterday, Qingjiao Yinyuan opened at 275 yuan, Qingjiao thin rice was 275 yuan to 273 yuan and a half, and Southern Gang early rice was 274 yuan to 272 yuan.

### Catechu Scarce

Catechu is extremely scarce due to the long absence of arrivals. The stock on hand at Cha No. Fang is also small. It is said that this item is widely needed for certain pills, so the market trend is extremely speculative, and the asking price is more than double that of last year, resulting in no transactions.

### Honesty Gains Respect

— Xīng

Honesty is the antonym of cunning and deceit. Those who are honest in their dealings are often taken advantage of and deceived by the cunning, so there is a saying that honesty is useless, which is generally rejected by society. However, at times, it is also respected. The reason for this respect is often flattery on the surface but slander in the heart. Those in high positions respect and exploit it. Those who are economically well-off respect and deceive it. Once an honest person loses their inherent power and becomes economically strapped, they are often rejected by the cunning: relatives become friends, friends become strangers, and even kick them when they are down, reversing the courteous manners of the past and avoiding them from afar. This is the adverse outcome for honest people. However, it is also the inevitable experience for those who have been in society for a long time. It can be seen that the respect gained by honest people is illusory, while being exploited and deceived is real. So why bother with honesty? Isn't it abandoned by society and heading towards elimination? Not so. But if honest people can remain consistent, not change their original intentions when exploited, and not change their normal state when deceived, always treating deception with sincerity and exploitation with honesty, then righteousness will overcome all evils, and in the end, they will surely gain respect and reap great rewards. As the saying goes: One must not have the heart to harm others, but one must have the heart to guard against others. This is also the way to be honest in the world, and it is also the reason why honesty gains respect. This is the positive harvest for honest people.

The cunning see honesty as self-deception, while the honest see cunning as deceiving others. Different viewpoints lead to different paths. As the saying goes: Honesty does not deceive. Various businesses use this as their slogan. Whether they can achieve it is not discussed here, but it can be seen that honesty can not deceive, and only by not deceiving can honesty be seen. This is an undeniable argument. With sincerity, the mind becomes righteous. Proceeding according to the path and extending it, it leads to peace throughout the world. It can also be seen that the idea of ​​honesty, in small matters, can govern the family, and in large matters, can bring peace to the world. How can it be disregarded as out of touch with the times? It is appropriate that it is respected.

Recently, seeing the widespread advertisement "Honesty Gains Respect" in the tram is like a sudden awakening, deeply inspiring people and enough to warn the cunning. However, with the decline of morality, people compete to be cunning, which may not be applicable to the society of Shanghai. However, in order to restore people's hearts, we still have to loudly proclaim: "Honesty Gains Respect!" May all the people of Shanghai endure it.

"King of Chu" will be performed for a month at the Lyceum Theatre, and Yáo Kè will personally take the stage to play the role of Fàn Zēng in the coming days.

Qílín Tóng is scheduled for a month at the Golden Theater, with a fee of 3,600 yuan per performance, calculated day and night—7,200 yuan. Such a huge amount will indeed make the "Beijing Chao School" lose money. Huáng Guìqiū's fee is 18,000 yuan, Wáng Xīchūn's is 9,000 yuan, and Fúróng Cǎo's is 20,000 yuan per year. It is said that the Golden Theater sells 10,000 yuan for a full house, and these few stars take half of it.

Guō Yùkūn's "Eighteen Arhats Fight Wukong" and "Wise Stimulation of the Monkey King," etc., "Li School" plays, are released several times and still have "work"; Xiǎo Yáng Yuèlóu is ultimately a man over forty, and the style of the "Investiture of the Gods" era is no longer there.

The "Hongchun Society" at the Tianchan Theater also has some small gimmicks. Compared with the Shanghai Drama School, commentators say: each has its own merits. In my unprofessional opinion, performing martial arts plays requires the words "fire" and "explosion," and the beauty of group play patterns is also their unique feature.

### Sharing a Boat Through Storms

Guó Fāng continued to take out biscuits and said, "Why are you all just talking and not eating? I'm afraid that melon seeds and peanuts have shells, which are inconvenient. These are for snacking, not for filling your stomach. I also have candy, but I won't take it out now. When you're tired of talking, I'll take it out to sweeten your mouths and invigorate you." Wéi Chéng laughed and casually put a biscuit in his mouth, saying, "Thank you, Miss Chén." Guó Fāng bumped her shoulder against Guó Qì and said, "Brother, he's thanking me, I can't stand it." Guó Qì said, "Only one thank you is allowed. When you bring out the coffee candy and toffee, Wéi Chéng won't be allowed to thank you anymore."

Guó Fāng put half a biscuit in her mouth, and then half a piece, pinching it in her hand, as if she couldn't wait to swallow it all before speaking. Her eyes looked at Wéi Chéng, but she negotiated with Guó Qì, "Brother, since you have such a good friend, why haven't you mentioned it to me? Even at school, at home, there aren't any photos of Mister Yè on the desk." After expressing her opinion, she put another half a biscuit in her mouth before continuing, "My brother is saying good friends, this criticism is right, but why did we suddenly become distant? This responsibility shouldn't be borne by me alone." Yī Wéi Chéng said, "We made an appointment: during the Lunar New Year, please come with your brother and sister to Huā Gǎng. When you get to Huā Gǎng, ask the Yè family of Shì Dé Táng, as long as they are locals, no one doesn't know them." Guó Fāng, without waiting for her brother to agree, said, "We must go. Brother and your old friend can make up for the distance before. I… I can't say it." She let Guó Qì's shadow cover her face again.

Guó Qì said, "Okay, my brother and sister will come to Huā Gǎng to see you first. Will you let us stay?" Wéi Chéng said, "Xú Rúxia Chén Fán's couch, is that necessary?" Guó Qì said, "Then we'll stay for one night. The next day, you'll come with us to Shuāng Qiáo. There are many things to do in Shuāng Qiáo: I know there's a festival during the New Year where you can watch the fair. We already have three people, let's get another person to play cards. I remember that the river in my hometown is always frozen three or four inches thick every New Year, so we can ice skate. The rest is eating and drinking. My grandmother can make a kind of Sū sugar, which is probably her unique skill. She brought it from her mother's house. No one in Shuāng Qiáo knows how to make it, only my grandmother knows how to make it. It tastes a bit loose and a bit sticky, and it's very delicious. She always wanted to pass this skill on to Guó Fāng, and she'll probably pass it on to her this time." (9)

### About "Empress" and Others

— Wén Dàshēng

The theater is called "Empress," the photo studio is called "Empress," and even the guide agency is called "Empress"...there are really too many to list. But people never pay attention to this kind of common name. However, in this inattention, we can deduce its reason—the reason is nothing more than expressing "respect" for women. And the "glory" that women get from the word "Empress" can be said to be "supreme." Because we have never seen an "Emperor" theater or an "Emperor" something hall.

Therefore, in schools with co-educational students, the "school flower" is "crowned" and honored as "Empress," which seems to be a "refined fashion" that must be popular. And on the dormitory door, the one with the pretty face is written with the words "First Palace," followed by "East Palace," "West Palace," "South Palace," and "North Palace" in order, while the one with pockmarks and a cleft lip will undoubtedly be assigned to the "Cold Palace"!

This trick seems to be fun at first glance, but if we think carefully, why are these fun tricks all done on women? It is not difficult to understand the truth—the reason is nothing more than playing with it.

It seems that women have not been available for people to "play with" since today, but since ancient times. But the "business eye" of using feminine names as "signs" seems to be the "brainchild" of modern "advertising experts"! This also explains why friends who engage in advertising techniques specialize in "thinking about ideas" on women.

Therefore, some people think that it is an "unlucky omen" for women to be lifted to the "ninety-ninth heaven." In fact, women have been taken advantage of and made fun of, which is extremely unjust, and they cannot express their suffering. (But there are really few women who understand that this is an insult to them.) And the "moral gentlemen" still want to call it "unlucky," which is really extremely unlucky.

However, there is no lack of brave women. Dating a boyfriend and then changing to another seems to have become a required course in "socializing." However, it is not uncommon for this to cause a storm of jealousy. Today (27th), it was reported that a case of smashing car glass worth 500 yuan on Bai Ke Road, and the reason, it is said, was precisely for this.

This really makes it difficult to be called "Empress," and it is even more difficult to make a boyfriend. And it is "more intense than ever" for women to be difficult to be women! Therefore, obtaining equal economic rights and obligations seems to be more necessary than talking about love!

### Hell in Paradise

— Chūnfēng

It is said that "Let's go drink tea" is no longer fashionable, and "Let's drink coffee" has replaced it. Is this the difference between "imported goods" and "local goods" (the Ceylon black tea in coffee shops), or are the snacks in tea rooms affected by corn flour? However, drinking coffee also requires going to an upscale place, otherwise, coffee grounds plus water, with no color or aroma, plus milk and sugar oil, is simply like a stinking ditch after a heavy rain, a complete mess. Fashion is abstract, or "being able to clear the mind" is more leisurely and contented.

Relatively upscale coffee shops are still very upscale. Although coal prices are expensive, the room is still full of spring. The coffee is CPC, and the cake is still covered with a thick layer of cream. Being locked inside, sipping and tasting slowly, will make you forget that you saw a corpse on the road.

Naturally, having a female companion makes it even more enjoyable. The red velvet sofa is no less lacking than the "lovers' seats" in the cinema. Talking about Dorothy Lamour can indeed go to Hollywood for a spin. Even talking about the most boring rice milling problem can generate a lot of laughter from the skills of my nanny. Thus, the afternoon quietly passes, and a clean tablecloth is laid to eat tongue and liver steak and chicken shredded soup.

If you are alone, you will always think it is too lonely. But it is not necessarily so. The coffee shop owner's idea is quite thoughtful, and the slot machine is waving to you. Although that "King" has been arrested and imprisoned, the merits he left to people are still as deep as the sea. For example, if a friend next door is lucky and wins the "Jackpot," then they will meet by chance and become acquainted at first sight. Otherwise, they will also regret each other, as if they have gained something.

Recently, many people are sighing that Shanghai is so big that there is nothing strange. In fact, if you look at everything calmly, there is nothing strange. Shanghai is basically "Hell in Paradise"!
