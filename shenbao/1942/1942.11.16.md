### Tunisian Border: German and British Troops Reported to Have Engaged; General Noguès Met with Darlan and Has Returned to Rabat, Retaining Original Position

Lisbon, 15th (Allied News Agency) - According to unofficial reports from here, the British First Army under Anderson has crossed the border between Algeria and Tunisia and is reported to have engaged with German troops yesterday. A Reuters correspondent at Allied Headquarters reports that Allied forces are concentrating 50 miles west of Bone in Tunisia, planning a major offensive. The BBC claims Allied paratroopers have landed in western Tunisia and that a large number of Allied troops have crossed the border. However, a London spokesperson refused to confirm this news. Both sides are highly active, with air forces bombing each other's transportation bases and troop concentrations. German air forces are specifically bombing British and American warships off the Algerian coast, inflicting heavy damage. According to a Paris radio broadcast yesterday, Admiral Godfroy, commander of French warships interned in Alexandria, declared that he would only obey the orders of Marshal Pétain.

Lisbon, 15th (Allied News Agency) - According to reports from London, General Noguès, commander-in-chief of German forces in Morocco, has returned to Rabat yesterday after meeting with Commander-in-Chief Darlan in Algiers, retaining his original position.

Berlin, 15th (Havas News Agency) - According to military sources, the first batch of German mechanized units and multiple aircraft have arrived in Tunisia.

Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency) - A summary of the situation in French North Africa and the Mediterranean, as gathered here, is as follows: The Allied forces invading Tunisia are advancing towards the military port of Bizerte. Simultaneously, paratroopers are landing in Bône. At the same time, the Axis forces are transporting infantry and tank units by air, concentrating in Tunis. A major decisive battle between the Axis and anti-Axis forces in that area is imminent. In addition, Allied air forces bombed French Sardinia in the Mediterranean on the 14th, but the damage was light.

German Air Transport Units Arrive Throughout Tunisia

Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to war reports from French North Africa and the Mediterranean received here on the 14th: (1) German air transport units have successively arrived in various parts of Tunisia, thus strengthening the Axis forces in that area, and seem to have completed preparations for launching guerrilla warfare against the British and American forces. (2) Although the Allied forces are facing fierce resistance from the French defense forces, they still have a strong momentum to advance. It is reported that the vanguard troops have occupied some strongholds and invaded Tunisia across the Algerian border, but no news of contact with the Axis forces has been received. (3) According to Vichy radio, a naval battle is said to be unfolding off Algiers, and it is also reported that the British fleet in Gibraltar sailed out one after another on the 13th, heading towards Algiers with British and American air squadrons. (4) Axis air forces in the Western Mediterranean are heavily bombing Allied fleets and transport ships, achieving great results. The Allied side also admits that the Axis air attacks have greatly hindered Allied operations. For example, according to London news on the 14th, the British and American fleets are concentrated in the narrow waters near North Africa, and combat operations are quite difficult due to attacks from Axis air forces and submarines.

Italian planes carried out low-altitude air strikes on airfields in French North Africa, and many enemy planes caught fire. Axis planes continued to bomb British and American ships in Algerian territorial waters. Last night, our submarines sank a British "Leander" class cruiser (7,000 tons) in the port of Bougie. Italian planes destroyed an enemy destroyer in the Eastern Mediterranean or seriously damaged it, causing it to sink. In recent days, we have lost ten planes.

### Solomon Islands: Fighting Underway; Germans Praise Japanese Naval Achievements

Lisbon, 15th (Allied News Agency) - The US Navy Department announced yesterday that the Solomon Islands campaign has been ongoing since the 12th, confirming the Japanese Imperial Headquarters' announcement of continued fierce fighting, but without providing details.

Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency) - After receiving the Japanese Imperial Headquarters' announcement of the victory in the naval battle near Guadalcanal, German radio immediately broadcasted it to the entire country, praising Japan's outstanding achievements. Observers here also say that the Allied fleet has suffered a great blow in the first and second Solomon Sea battles and the South Pacific naval battle. Their so-called Pacific counter-offensive operation has only become an opportunity for the Japanese Navy to demonstrate its power. Every Allied naval attack has been thwarted. The new achievements of the Japanese Navy this time are enough to prove that the Japanese Navy has established a solid position in the Pacific.

### Japanese Naval Achievements

### German Troops Construct Defensive Lines Northwest and South of Stalingrad; Berlin Announces Repulse of Soviet Counterattacks; Fierce Fighting Along the Terek River

Berlin, 15th (Allied News Agency) - Military sources here claimed today that German and their Axis allies deeply entrenched on the entire Soviet front yesterday, repelling Soviet attacks. German air forces flew behind Soviet lines to disrupt their supply lines and bases. Soviet troops are attacking the city of Stalingrad in an attempt to drive out the Germans. Fighting is ongoing. Little news has been received from the central and northern sectors. In the northern sector, the Red Army southeast of Lake Ilmen has taken the initiative, but these are local battles and have all been repelled. German artillery in the Leningrad area bombarded targets in the city.

German Headquarters, 15th (Haitong News Agency) - The German High Command announced this afternoon that enemy troops fiercely attacked the Caucasus yesterday but were repelled by German and Romanian forces. The enemy's counterattack in the city of Stalingrad was also repelled. German planes assisted the army in combat, bombing enemy artillery positions east of the Volga with great success. The enemy's local offensives in the Lake Ilmen area did not succeed. Enemy stations and trains were bombed day and night by German planes.

Stockholm, Sweden, 15th (Havas News Agency) - According to the latest news from Berlin, German stormtroopers have reoccupied several buildings in the Red Army defense zone in the city of Stalingrad. However, German officials deny that German forces have taken any new offensive actions. In reality, there are only small-scale battles, with the German army making slight progress. With the severe winter approaching, the German army is building defensive lines northwest and south of Stalingrad to defend and hold them, and has been repeatedly attacked by the Red Army. This new defensive line is along the west bank of the Volga River. Once the Volga freezes and allows people and tanks to move on the river, it will be vulnerable to Red Army attacks. According to reports from German reconnaissance units, a large number of Red Army troops are concentrated on the east bank of the Volga, preparing to attack this winter. As for the situation on the Caucasus front, there has been no actual change. German officials said that the severe winter is approaching in an instant, and it will soon make large-scale warfare impossible. However, because all the goals of the German summer offensive have not been fully achieved, it is too early to say that the situation on the Eastern Front will become calm at this time. Assuming that the Red Army launches a winter offensive again, it will be completely clear that this year's situation is different from last year's. The reasons for the German optimism are as follows: (1) Most of the Eastern Front has not changed, that is, from Kursk to Leningrad to Murmansk, the German army is using this long-silent front to build stronger defenses than last winter. (2) The bandits and special agents in the rear of the German army have been cleared of the remaining enemies, and there are convenient highways and railways for transportation. The supply problem, which was considered difficult last winter, will not be difficult to solve this winter. (3) The equipment of German soldiers is better than last year and can adapt to the winter climate. (4) The Soviet Union has suffered great losses in manpower, material resources, and territory this summer, so its combat effectiveness and offensive power have been greatly weakened.

Berlin, 15th (Haitong News Agency) - Although the war on the Eastern Front has been slightly affected by the arrival of winter, this year's situation cannot be compared with the sudden severe cold of last winter. If the Soviet army launches a winter offensive, its losses will be greater than last year. The German army is fully prepared for winter warfare. It is not yet known how the Soviet army will use the winter. Recently, the Soviet army has concentrated in various places, and German planes have bombed them heavily. The Pologoye railway center suffered particularly heavy losses. The supply line east of Lake Ilmen was also bombed. In the Stalingrad area, the Soviet artillery positions, roads, and railways on the east bank of the Volga were also bombed. In the Mitschiloskaja area, six trains were destroyed. Axis planes assisted in combat in various places. The situation in the western Caucasus and the Terek area is fierce. On the Stalingrad front, the German army has not launched a large-scale offensive.

Somewhere on the German border, 15th (Havas News Agency) - It has just been learned that fierce fighting broke out on both sides of the Terek River in the Caucasus yesterday, and the battle is still raging today. The purpose of the German and Romanian forces' attack on the Red Army is to break through the Red Army positions west of Grozny.

### Spain Closely Monitors the Situation in the Mediterranean; Tense Atmosphere in Madrid

Madrid, 15th (Haitong News Agency) - Spanish people are deeply aware that the war is approaching Spain after the British and American invasion of French North Africa, so they are paying close attention to the development of the situation in the Mediterranean, but their attitude is calm. The semi-official newspaper "Arriba" reviewed the situation and issued its conclusion, saying that the Spanish people, under the leadership of the Spanish government led by Franco, will always fight for the interests of the Spanish nation, no matter how the situation evolves. Although the war is now approaching Spain, General Franco will have his decisions to maintain the interests of the country. The Spanish people are united, which is the most satisfactory achievement of the Falangist Party. Spanish people can now abandon their political prejudices and think together for the benefit of the country.

Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Madrid, General Yagüe, former Minister of the Army of Spain, returned to Madrid from northern Spain on the 14th and immediately visited President Franco for important talks. In addition, General Kindelán, commander of the 加特雜幹 region, has also arrived in Madrid. Currently, important military and political figures are gathered in Madrid, and the atmosphere is quite tense. Madrid, 15th (Haitong News Agency) - The "ABC" newspaper commented this morning that the recent developments in North Africa have dramatically changed the strategic situation in the Mediterranean. If the Allied forces capture Tunisia, they will gain a superior base for attacking Tripoli. If the Axis forces can occupy Tunisia, they can not only defend against their attack on Tripoli, but also protect maritime transport between Italy and Germany in Europe and Africa. If they can occupy Bizerte, they can strengthen the strategic route of Toulon, Tunis, Corsica, Sardinia, and Sicily. At that time, the Axis powers can control the area between Sardinia and Sicily and the British shipping from Algiers to Malta, making it impossible to pass through.

### Pétain Will Announce Important Decision

Vichy, 15th (Haitong News Agency) - After Admiral Darlan, Commander-in-Chief of the French Army, ordered a ceasefire, Marshal Pétain immediately sent a telegram to rebuke him. The content of the telegram has now been announced. Therefore, it is said that Darlan's dismissal is a response to this move. It is also heard that Marshal Pétain will issue an important decision in the form of a declaration. Now that Pétain has assumed the position of Supreme Commander of the French Army, it is widely believed that in his declaration, he will announce the removal of Darlan from other positions. Article 7 of the national law promulgated by France in the winter of 1941 stipulated that Darlan would be Pétain's successor. It is widely believed that this article will also be revoked. It is also learned that Pétain will continue to urge the French soldiers in North Africa to resist the British and American invading troops.

Vichy, 15th (Haitong News Agency) - Although the content of Darlan's telegram to Pétain has not yet been announced, judging from Pétain's reply, we can know that Pétain does not seem willing to immediately regard Darlan as someone like Tego尔 and季劳. However, Pétain's assumption of the position of Supreme Commander of the French Army two days ago has proven that he has suspected Darlan's loyalty. His reply is actually a final warning to Darlan.

Vichy, 15th (Haitong News Agency) - According to the French Ministry of Information, after the defeat of the French army in Morocco and Algiers, the situation in North Africa is extremely chaotic. Admiral Pétain sent a telegram to Admiral Darlan clarifying his instructions after Admiral Darlan's reply to Admiral Pétain proved that he had violated the instructions.

### German Troops Begin Deploying on the French Mediterranean Coast; The Port of Marseille Is As Peaceful As Usual

The task of occupying the common positions in southern France has been completed. The transportation of troops, with the cooperation of the Vichy French authorities, has come to an end. "There were no accidents." The key strategic points on the French Mediterranean coast in southern France are now protected by [German] and Italian troops. The Axis forces entered the unoccupied zone of France quickly and smoothly. Activities in various places continue as usual.

Vichy, 15th (Havas News Agency) - German troops are deploying along the French Mediterranean coast. The port of Marseille is still as peaceful as usual. Yesterday, a large German contingent and motorized machine gun units and anti-aircraft artillery units passed through the streets of Marseille. As for the daily life of the general public in recent days, there have been no major changes. The only difference is that German officers are staying in large hotels, and German soldiers are patrolling everywhere. Anti-aircraft guns have been installed on the Canebière, a bustling street in Marseille, and are guarded by German military police. The general public, seeing that the city is likely to be attacked, have left one after another to take refuge in the interior.

Ajaccio, Corsica, 14th (Havas News Agency) - The Administrative Committee of Corsica Province held a meeting today, chaired by the Provincial Governor, and immediately decided to send a telegram of allegiance to Marshal Pétain, which included the words "Unfortunately, our province is at the forefront, we must do our best, and respectfully pay our respects to Your Excellency." At the same time, a telegram was also sent to the head of government, Laval, supporting the current policy.

### Model Ship Renamed at the Exhibition

Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency) - The model warship "Greater East Asia" at the Greater East Asia War Exhibition has attracted great interest from the audience since the official opening of the exhibition, especially the booming sound of simulated battles, which almost made the audience feel as if they were on the battlefield. Now, in order to give the Chinese people a deeper understanding, according to Chairman Wang's instructions, when Admiral Koga Mineichi, former commander of the Chinese Area Fleet, came to Beijing to bid farewell, he conveyed to the persons in charge of the exhibition that the model warship "Greater East Asia" should be renamed "Great Wall." It is understood that the renaming was done on the 14th.

Jiaxing, 15th (Central News Agency) - The Qingxiang Committee's office in Zhejiang has long established a pre-determined procedure for handling autonomy and Baojia affairs in various districts and ordered various special zones to follow it. In order to complete it as soon as possible, a deadline has been set. Starting this month, the household survey forms must be completed and doorplates must be issued, and a register of able-bodied men must be created. At the end of the month, the district head and compilation staff will conduct a random inspection of the household registration. Starting next month, the Baojia area and the joint guarantee agreement will be completed. At the end of the month, the management of self-renovating households will be reorganized. At the same time, the Baojia office will be completed.

Jiaxing, 15th (Central News Agency) - The Qingxiang Committee's office in Zhejiang aims to promote the legal circulation of materials through the economic blockade of the Qingxiang, so as to stabilize the people's livelihood. The large and small inspection stations set up in various places are also responsible for handling all matters related to the entry and exit of materials and the inspection of all material movements. However, it has recently been heard that some inspection personnel do not comply with the regulations during inspection, deliberately causing difficulties or confiscating materials that violate the meaning of the economic blockade, which has a great significance. Therefore, a special commissioner has secretly reported and ordered the blockade management offices of various special zones to comply with it.

Africa in the Changing Storm

### The World's Attention on French North Africa (6)

Since the break between England and France until today, the accusations leveled by England against France have been truly countless. Setting aside incidents such as the British air raids on mainland France, the British army's occupation of Syria, the failed British landing at Dieppe in occupied France, and the British army's attack on Madagascar, a look at North Africa alone is enough to prove the extent of British intentions. (1) On the morning of March 30, 1941, four French warships, protected by a destroyer, sailed from Casablanca, Morocco, to Oran, Algeria, and were suddenly attacked by British warships en route. (2) On May 30 of that year, British warships bombarded the port of Sfax, Tunisia, allegedly because the port harbored Italian merchant ships, which was detrimental to them. In June, British aircraft again visited the port to bomb it. The French Minister of the Navy, Darlan, painfully declared that no fewer than 142 French ships had been detained by the British, and 792,000 tons had been sunk. (3) In December of that year, the French ship "Denis" was sailing from North Africa, carrying fresh fruits, vegetables, and wines to Marseille, when it was sunk by a British submarine in the Mediterranean. (4) On March 3, 1942, a French convoy merchant ship was sailing from Sfax to Tunis when it was sunk by the British at sea. (5) On August 13, 1942, a French postal plane was strafed by British aircraft with machine guns over the Algerian coast, resulting in multiple casualties among the crew. (6) On September 2 of the same year, the French freighter "Libreville" was sailing from the port of Tunis to Sfax when it was sunk by a submarine en route. The above are just some major examples, which prove that the British were constantly exerting their efforts. Therefore, the massive landing of British and American Allied forces in North Africa on November 8, 1942, was already expected.

B. Weygand's Dismissal

During the Three Kingdoms period, Zhuge Kongming recognized that his subordinate general Wei Yan had rebellious tendencies and would inevitably betray him in the long run, so he arranged a clever plan in advance to deal with him. Who is the modern-day Wei Yan? Could it be General Weygand, who once served as the French Commissioner for various African territories? Weygand flatly refuses to admit it, but the modern-day Mr. Zhuge does not have the demeanor of a feather fan and silk headband, but only three fires of inexplicable anger. During Weygand's tenure in North Africa, rumors often circulated in Europe that he was "colluding with de Gaulle and antagonizing a certain country." This de Gaulle, a French secessionist element with no borrowed authority, only has a mob under his command. Whether it is worth General Weygand's collusion is fundamentally a question. However, these rumors slowly spread and eventually became the reason for Weygand's dismissal.

What kind of person is Weygand? His background is neither too big nor too small. He is also one of France's leading military talents. He has fought against the German and Red Armies. During the First European War, he belonged to General Joffre's command, and later transferred to General Foch's command. He made great contributions in the Battle of the Marne. He was then transferred to serve as the Chief of Staff of the French Northern Army, where he demonstrated his wisdom. In 1920, he was ordered to go to Poland to assist the Polish army in relieving the siege of the Red Army. Afterwards, he was transferred to the French-mandated territory of Syria, where he served for five years and was promoted to Chief of Staff of the French Army. He retired in 1935, intending to live a peaceful life writing, but in 1939, as the Franco-German War approached, he was summoned by the government to serve the country again. He was first sent to the Near East to organize French affairs, and later commanded operations near the country. After the Franco-German armistice, under the guidance of Marshal Pétain, he first served as Minister of National Defense, and then was appointed as Commissioner for various territories in Africa.

There were two main reasons for Weygand's appointment to this position: (1) To show Germany that France still had considerable strength in North Africa and had brilliant command. If Germany could respect French sovereignty in accordance with the Franco-German armistice agreement, that would be fine, otherwise France would still have room to maneuver. (2) To show Britain and the de Gaulle faction that North Africa had a lieutenant general to protect it, so they shouldn't overstep their bounds and invite trouble. Weygand had some plans during his tenure as High Commissioner. In November 1941, French Minister of the Army, General Huntziger, inspected North Africa, traveling over 10,000 miles, and had close contact with Weygand. Unfortunately, General Huntziger died in a plane crash on his return journey. This tragic news symbolized Weygand's failure, and soon Weygand was dismissed and recalled to his home country.

The French government announced the reasons for the dismissal as: (1) The purpose of establishing the position of Commissioner for various territories in Africa was to establish close contact between Tunisia, Morocco, and Senegal, which were directly threatened. (2) To unify command in order to protect local natives and French residents. (3) To concentrate administrative power. The conclusion was: Now that the various territories are becoming more consolidated, the existence of the Commissioner's position would hinder activities, so it was abolished.

This far-fetched reason is ultimately not enough to conceal the fact of German pressure. Germany did not want anyone to carry out obstructive work in French North Africa, which was the biggest reason. For Weygand himself, who was already 75 years old, it was time to retire, so he retired with Marshal Pétain's commendation.

On December 2, 1941, the month after the abolition of the North African Commissioner, Marshal Pétain and German Aviation Minister and Deputy Marshal, General Göring, met in Saint-Florentin, Yonne, in the occupied zone, to discuss various Franco-German issues, including the defense of French colonies. After Weygand's departure, British and American public opinion was in an uproar, believing that Germany's occupation of North Africa was inevitable. Even the recent blitz landing was justified by this. (End of this article)

### Food Offices in the Two Concessions to Issue Bread Coupons Starting Today; Registered Households Can Collect with Citizen Certificates; Unregistered People Can Exchange Flour for Bread

The issuance of bread coupons in the two concessions, which the Hankou Road Municipal Council's Grain Management Committee and the Fuli Road French Concession Grain Office began handling on the 21st of last month, has been meticulously planned. It has now been decided that the first bread coupons will be issued today (the 16th).

Dates and Quantities are Specified

According to a report by a Daji News Agency reporter, these bread coupons are divided into two types, red and blue. The red coupons can be used to collect eight ounces of bread per day, and the blue coupons can be used to collect two ounces of bread per day. The former is specifically issued to foreign residents, and the latter is used by Chinese households. The bread coupons issued this time are valid for the months of December this year and January next year. The location for Chinese people to collect coupons is exactly the same as the location for purchasing rice coupons in each district. Foreigners' bread coupons are directly issued by the grain management committees of the two concessions.

Methods for Exchanging Flour for Bread

The coupon issuance date is from today (the 16th) until the 28th. All registered bread-eating households, foreigners can collect with the householder's residence permit, and Chinese can collect with their individual citizen certificates. As for residents who do not yet have a citizen residence permit, they can apply with their registration certificate. The stipulated amount of bread that Chinese registered bread-eating households can purchase each day is less than that of foreign residents. As for ordinary Chinese people who have not registered, if they want bread, they can exchange an equal amount of flour for bread at the bakery, but they need to pay the factory a certain amount for manufacturing fees.

Unregistered People Cannot Buy

It is also understood that since December 1st, bakeries have been stipulated to have no right to sell bread to unregistered households, but they can only sell it if there is any bread left over after 5 pm each day. Therefore, from next month, ordinary unregistered residents will have no bread to eat before 5 pm every day, except for the method of exchanging their flour for bread.

### Sugar to be Distributed Per Capita Starting Next Month; Methods Awaiting Approval from Authorities

Shanghai sugar merchants' cooperative business of distributing sugar per capita is reportedly decided to be implemented from December 1st. The specific methods have been researched and decided, and will be announced after being approved by the authorities.

Regarding this month's sugar allocation, after it was decided that the total amount would be 25,000 bags, a Shanghai She reporter inquired at the Sugar Industry Cooperative Office yesterday. It was learned that the sugar for this month's allocation has been issued a movement permit and is being withdrawn from various foreign warehouses and stored in the Cooperative Office's warehouses. The allocation procedures are being rushed to be completed and it is expected that the allocation can be made within the next week. (1) Type A households, retailers, will be allocated 70% of the total amount. (2) Type B users, various restaurants and other food stores, will be allocated 30% of the total amount. As for the sugar allocated, it will be #24 coarse sand sugar, Dutch red sand sugar, TK sugar, B-character white sugar, this factory's snow-white sugar, CC green ice, ice flower green, Surabaya green, etc.

The Sugar Merchant Business Cooperative Office has received many complaints from the Sanfang in the concession that the Erfangdong who hold the housing donation ticket refuse to distribute the sugar purchased with the donation ticket to the tenants based on the average number of people in the whole household. Therefore, they requested that measures be taken to provide relief. The Office declared yesterday that according to the temporary measures for door-to-door sugar sales, the sugar should be distributed equally based on the population of the entire household and should not be enjoyed solely by the Erfangdong. Therefore, the Sanfang tenants can demand distribution from the Erfangdong. If there is not enough after distribution, they can purchase one yuan of sugar per person each time from retailers with their citizen certificate.

### Edible Oil in the Two Concessions to be Sold Universally Today

In order to make up for the lack of edible oil in the market, the Shanghai Edible Oil Industry Wholesale Office has already ordered 1,000 tons of edible oil from the military allocation authorities. The procedures for moving 500 tons (10,000 dan) have been completed, and the oil has been transported and allocated to various registered edible oil retail stores. Starting at 9 am this morning (the 16th), the oil can be sold universally. However, each person is limited to half a catty. In order to prevent malfeasance, the Wholesale Office will post the amount of oil issued each day at the entrance of each retail store, and will advise residents to report any illegal speculative activities of the retail merchants to the Wholesale Office on the 5th floor of the Sichuan Road Enterprise Building at any time. If found, the Wholesale Office will, together with the police, severely punish the violating stores. As for the official price limit for oil, it is 7.2 yuan in storage coupons per catty for raw oil, 6.36 yuan for soybean oil, and 6.08 yuan for rapeseed oil. However, a 2% commodity retail donation must be added. According to a Datong News Agency reporter, the remaining 500 tons of the oil quantity set by the Wholesale Office can also be distributed around the 20th. It is also heard that the stagnation of edible oil this time was due to the change of authorities. In the future, there will be no panic over edible oil.

### Continued Report on the Tragic Death of Wang Qipei; Coffin Sealing Ceremony Held at the International Funeral Home Yesterday

Lawyer Wang Qipei was stabbed to death with sharp scissors in his apartment on the dawn of the day before yesterday (the 12th), as reported in this newspaper. Because the case is bizarre and there are various rumors, this reporter inquired about the details and continues to report below.

Living Alone in Shanghai

Wang Qipei was from Hanyang, Hubei. He was 36 years old. He studied politics and sociology at Shanghai University and then transferred to the law department of Soochow University, earning a Bachelor of Laws degree. He then stayed in Shanghai to practice law. Later, he married Yang Meizhen, a woman from his hometown. During the Shanghai War, his wife, Meizhen, went to the mainland to work in the education sector, while Wang moved to Room A, No. 2, of the Saint Paul Foreign Apartments at 97 Huanlong Road in the French Concession. He has lived there for four or five years and has been living peacefully.

Numerous Knife Wounds

At about 8:15 am on the day before yesterday (the 12th), a maid opened the door and entered to prepare breakfast for Wang. However, she did not see Wang. As soon as the maid stepped into the room, she saw that the tables and chairs were messy and the newspapers were all over the floor. Wang was not on the bed, so she knew something was wrong. She then found Wang dead in the bathroom, his body lying face down next to the bathtub. The maid saw bloodstains on the floor and found that his neck, abdomen, shoulders, arms, and lower parts of his body had numerous knife wounds, totaling as many as twelve. The maid was shocked and ran to tell the woman in the west-central apartment building, who reported it to the Central Police Station in Lujiawan. Police officers were dispatched to investigate. They then carried the body to the autopsy room on Dallas Road for examination.

Stabbed to Death with Scissors

The police officers found a pair of scissors in Wang's bedroom, with bloodstains on them. It was suspected that the murderer used this as a weapon to stab Wang to death. They took them to the police station for filing. When asked by the reporter, a neighbor in the apartment building said that at about 6 am that morning, before dawn, he suddenly heard the sound of floorboards in Room 2, but he did not investigate further. He did not expect that an accident would occur. Wang must have resisted, but was ultimately poisoned and died an unnatural death.

Coffin Sealing Ceremony Yesterday

It is understood that Wang had excellent knowledge, was capable in handling affairs, and was good at making friends. He was once a member of the Chinese regiment of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps. In addition to being a lawyer, he also served as the deputy manager of a large insurance company. He was skilled in dancing and his business was booming. His sudden assassination this time caused great sorrow among his friends. There are various rumors about the cause of his death. The body has been moved to the International Funeral Home on Jiaozhou Road for the coffin sealing ceremony. His friends have organized a funeral committee to handle the funeral arrangements, and at the same time, they have telegraphed Wang's family in Hankou. Yesterday afternoon at 3 pm, a memorial service was held according to Christian rituals. The coffin was temporarily placed in the funeral home.

In the final decisive game, Pu Kun gang of Sanyi fought Liu Baotai of Qinglian. Pu's ball skills were superb, and he was successful in smashing and killing.

### The Middle School Round Gate Ball Game Opens: Nanyang Loses to Xiqing

Women's Patriotic Team Narrowly Defeats Friends Team

The Middle School Cup round gate ball league, sponsored by the Shiye Middle School, opened at 2:30 pm yesterday on the Shiye Middle School's sports ground on Nanyang Road. The audience was large. The first match was a women's exhibition between the Friends team and the Patriotic team. Liu Zichang performed the opening ball ceremony. Due to a mistake by Shi Ruijuan, the goalkeeper of the Friends team, they had to borrow a player from the Patriotic team, which inevitably weakened their strength. However, the match was still exceptionally exciting. The Patriotic team narrowly won with a score of two to zero. Originally, a men's exhibition between the Zhonglian team and the Shiye team was scheduled to follow, but it was canceled due to the late hour. The final main event was a match between Nanyang and Xiqing. The two teams had previously clashed once, with Nanyang winning five to three. This time, they met again, and Xiqing was determined to take revenge. The famous player Tao Bolinji also came to the field to help. Nanyang's Han Longhai and others were absent, resulting in Xiqing maintaining the upper hand throughout the match. In the first half, Nanyang was behind by one to four. In the end, Xiqing defeated Nanyang five to three. The organizing committee announced that any participating teams that had not yet completed the procedures should go to the school to complete them as soon as possible.

### Market Trends

Stock Market Intimidated

Last week, the Chinese stock market showed a weak trend. The reasons are: first, the shortage of funds; second, the large-scale attacks from all sides. The latter had a greater impact than the former. Although there have been many precedents in recent months, this is a first for the stock market. No wonder people are in low spirits! But judging the matter on its merits, this is not enough to eliminate speculation, but it creates opportunities for speculators. The purpose of eliminating speculation is to stabilize the market; this is just lending speculators the opportunity to stir up trouble. The same is true for public bonds and cotton cloth; there are many precedents for this.

According to the index of sixteen major Chinese stocks compiled by the Chinese Economic Research Institute, with the previous week as 100%, the total index last week still increased by 2.7%; with June as 100%, the total index last week was 165.4%, still more than 3% higher than the average of the previous week, as shown in the following table:

The recent rise in stock prices is a phenomenon that should occur when idle funds have nowhere to go. If currency can be contracted for a long time, then both the stock market and commodity prices can be stabilized. However, this is not something that can be expected in wartime; however, it seems unwise to let it do as it pleases. What can be done? It is better to fully guide funds into the right path, that is, investing in Chinese stocks is precisely the right path to guide funds into the right path. Why treat it as speculation again? Especially since the prosperity of the stock market, there have been many places that have given people reason to criticize. Recently, the Dongbao newspaper reported two things. Regardless of whether they fully conform to the facts, they are still worth noting.

(1) Organize a business company, absorb idle funds, and designate investments in certain companies. The so-called investment is actually to collect stocks of such companies. As a result, the market price of such companies' stocks rises sharply, and they can also sell them at a high price (see the Japanese "Continental New Report" on the 12th of this month).

(2) Establish nominal companies, issue empty stocks, and sell them after raising the market price. It is said that the stocks of 52 companies, such as so-and-so, are all products of this type (see the Japanese "China Intelligence" on the 14th of this month).

If the allegations are true, then they can indeed be regarded as manipulation and fraud. Therefore, in terms of business, it is also known that it is dangerous to step into the trap of chasing empty stocks in the midst of a frantic rise.

Cotton Cloth and Serge Still

The Shuangma market continues to be suspended, while the Lanfeng market operates as usual. Dongbao has discussed the establishment of a control association, believing that the time is not yet ripe; however, it is regarded as the ultimate way to eliminate cotton cloth speculation.

At present, the relevant authorities seem to be paying attention to setting the official price of cotton cloth. It is also said that the purchase price of cotton will be used as the calculation standard. It is now known that the purchase price of cotton determined by the Huazhong Cotton Control Association is divided into two parts: one is the ex-warehouse price of the association's warehouses in Shanghai, and the other is the purchase price at the place of origin. The details are recorded below.

(A) Ex-warehouse price of the Control Association's Shanghai warehouses (unit: yuan per dan)

Shanghai Cotton

First Grade: Changyinsha Cotton 960

Second Grade: Taicang Cotton 930

Third Grade: Southern Taicang 920

Fourth Grade: Beishi Cotton 900

Jiangbei Cotton

First Grade: Dazhong Jimei Seed Cotton 1050

Second Grade: Funing American Seed, American Seed Cotton 1050

Third Grade: Qidong American Seed 1000

Fourth Grade: Chicken Foot Cotton 970

Fifth Grade: Native Seed Cotton 960

Zhedong Area Cotton

Coarse Velvet: Hangyin, Anqing 860

(B) Purchase Price of Cotton at the Place of Origin

The Huazhong Cotton Control Association is a newly added organization for purchasing raw cotton. It was established in mid-October of this year. The association's purchase system, which was detailed in past issues of this publication, is divided into two parts: Jiangbei and Jiangnan. The former's purchase area is east of the Grand Canal and is handled by the Japanese. The Jiangbei Cotton Purchase Association is organized, with two pastoral buying companies under it. The Jiangnan purchase area, in addition to the Jiangnan area, includes the area west of the Jiangbei Grand Canal. There are Japanese-Chinese cooperation and Chinese business operations. There are nine buying companies under it. The following is a list of its organizational structure.

(Jointly operated; only the Ningbo area is operated by Chinese merchants)

Last week, the cotton cloth market was initially weak and then firm. Dragon head fine cloth fell to 189 yuan, a decrease of ten yuan. Factory cloth also unanimously looked smaller. There was speculative activity in serge, while the footing was still weak.

### Company News

Rongfeng Textile Company

Capital Increase News

Rongfeng Textile Factory at No. 74 Daxilu, Shanghai, was established after the war by the famous industrialists Xu Caicheng and Zhang Rongchu. The internal equipment includes more than 20,000 spinning spindles, more than 1,000 doubling spindles, more than 400 looms, and an attached bleaching and dyeing finishing factory, employing more than 1,000 workers. In the past, it produced wool serge for the masses, and in recent years, it has produced various cotton cloths under the Jinqiao and Bumblebee brands. The factory's capital was originally 3 million yuan in legal tender. Last month, it increased its capital to 10 million yuan in Central Reserve Certificates. Yesterday (the 15th), a shareholders meeting for the capital increase was held at the factory's office. However, because various circles still requested investment, the shareholders' meeting decided to increase the capital again by 2.5 million yuan in Central Reserve Certificates, divided into 250,000 shares, issued at a premium, that is, each share has a par value of 10 yuan, plus a premium of 10 yuan, for a total of 40 yuan in Central Reserve Certificates for each premium share subscribed. The total premium is 7.5 million yuan, which will be included in the company's statutory reserve fund. It is heard that the company has printed a balance sheet and a list of assets for investors to refer to in order to show its credibility. All procedures are being expedited and may be announced in the near future.

Fumin Weaving Factory Capital Increase

The Fumin Weaving Factory has already increased its capital by one million yuan. Each share has a par value of ten yuan and is scheduled to start trading on the stock market this morning.

### People Are Not Wood or Stone, But...

— Lin Da

People are not wood or stone, but they also have their own wood and stone qualities.

A piece of wood can be used as a beam, can be made into furniture, and can also be carved into works of art. But it must first be a solid piece of wood. To become a solid piece of wood, it must undergo decades of painstaking cultivation, endure wind and frost, absorb sunlight and air, and suck fertilizer and water from the soil to become a large, straight, and proud tree.

A stone can be used as a foundation stone, can be built into a bridge, and can also be carved into a stone statue. But it must first be a hard stone, after thousands of years of natural evolution, wind and rain erosion, and huge pressure, then it can become a useful good stone, and can bear the tasks that people give it.

People are also like this. A person can be an engineer, a doctor, an artist, a writer, a banker, a politician,... but first, he must go through good school education, social training, experience lessons, patient self-cultivation, and hard struggle; he must first become a useful person, and then he is enough to be a heroic man who stands upright between heaven and earth.

People are not wood or stone, but they also have similarities to wood and stone.

### Lice and Soldiers

— Shi Dong

When the European War broke out, a group of war correspondents were led to the Western Front to inspect the French army's front line. They saw a team of French soldiers sitting on the side of the road, with their backs exposed, carefully inspecting their shirts.

They were not studying the texture of the fabric. In fact, they were doing a military task that European soldiers had been doing for at least twenty centuries. It turned out that they were catching lice on their shirts!

What these war correspondents saw was actually a very important military event. At that time on the Western Front, there were no military actions for several weeks; but as long as there were lice, there was no leisure to speak of on the war front.

However, the French soldiers groping along the seams of their shirts were actually doing futile work. They might catch a few, kill them—this is the usual way to end their lives—but unless all their clothing is disinfected, the eggs still exist. As long as she gets enough freedom and leisure, a female louse can produce 5,000 offspring every eight weeks. Let us accept the average and assume that half of these 5,000 are female. Then, two months later, the 2,500 daughters born to this old louse will become the mothers of 12.5 million small lice. Long before that, there would be no room left for a soldier on his body.

You must never think that lice will all be eliminated in peacetime. They will attach themselves to unclean citizens, although the mortality rate is quite high. There are many such unsanitary people in the world, taking care of the peacetime cadres of lice.

When the mobilization order is issued, the lice also begin to mobilize. They can't wait to put on their uniforms and slip into the seams of shirts and pants. They have no contact with the rear troops, because most of the soldiers in the rear live in cleaner barracks and comfortable dormitories. They have to run all the way to the front line, where everything is dirty and filthy, soldiers can't remember the date of their last bath, and don't change their clothes for several days. Lice love to make friends with people who are suffering the most pain and discomfort.

The appearance of lice on the Western Front really had a very terrible meaning. During the First World War, the diseases it spread were more than all insects combined. Lice are ruthless murderers. They are the transmitters of typhoid fever, relapsing fever, and trench fever (a type of fever suffered by soldiers in the trenches). In Serbia, more people died of typhoid fever than soldiers killed on the front lines. Months after the armistice, after refugees had been living in peace for quite some time, typhoid lice were easily isolated and eliminated.

Eastern Europe is the favorite habitat for lice. When the First World War broke out, it followed the Tsar's army and invaded the eastern part of Prussia. Hindenburg and Ludendorff blocked the Russian army at Tannenberg, but the lice continued to advance. They left the Russian army and almost all attached themselves to the German army. Now history is repeating itself; lice are spreading terrible diseases on the German-Soviet front again.

### Porcelain

— Zhang Zhichen

(3) Getting Rich by the Firehead

People in Fuliang County mostly make a living by burning porcelain, so they have the saying "Getting rich by the firehead." Burning kilns is a matter of deep superstition in Fuliang County. They enshrine the kiln god as a deity. If the products are not good, they say that it is caused by disrespect for the kiln god, and if they do not change their attitude, there may even be a disaster of kiln collapse. In ancient times, the areas around the kiln were not allowed to be approached by idlers or visited by the kiln. The taboo against women was especially deep, otherwise, they would be disrespectful to the kiln god. It is said that in the past, a passing traveler from a distant village accidentally walked close to the kiln and, out of curiosity, peeped at the situation of burning the kiln. When he was discovered by the kiln burner, he immediately gathered the crowd to detain this uninvited guest. Late at night, fearing that the kiln god would be angered and cause the kiln to collapse, they actually threw this innocent person into the kiln and burned him to death as a sacrifice to the kiln god. Several years ago, when Mr. Du Chongyuan went to Fuliang County, he tried his best to break superstitions and carefully studied the formula and kiln burning technology, changed to a new type of kiln, shortened the length and lowered the height by one-third, so there was no more unfortunate event of kiln collapse, and superstitious thoughts were gradually eliminated.

According to legend, in ancient times, a certain person was ordered to burn imperial porcelain, but he could not burn the porcelain specified by the emperor, and the deadline was approaching. If he could not burn it again, he would be in danger of being severely punished or killed for offending the emperor. When burning the last kiln, a certain person's young daughter, who loved her father dearly, could not bear to sit idly by and watch her father be punished, so she jumped into the kiln and committed suicide behind everyone's back. Unexpectedly, after this kiln was burned and opened, the kiln was full of the best porcelain that was suitable for the emperor's specifications. Therefore, every time the kiln is burned and the kiln door is sealed, two parallel round holes are left at the top of the kiln door built of bricks, and a rice bowl or a saggar is placed in each hole. A thin, straight, long seam is also left at the lower section of the kiln door. It is said that this symbolizes the two breasts and the vulva of a woman, hoping that each product in the kiln can achieve excellent results.

When the people of Fuliang County build a new kiln, they must choose an auspicious day to start work, and the ceremony is very grand. After the completion, they must worship the kiln god. It is said that in ancient times, every time a new kiln was completed, when burning the first kiln, a pair of children, boys and girls, had to be burned alive in the kiln as a sacrifice to the kiln god. Because according to superstitious people, otherwise, this new kiln would never have the hope of burning good porcelain. This cruel superstitious act was later banned by the government and has disappeared. However, when a new kiln is completed, some people still tie dry grass into a pair of grass figures of men and women and place them in the kiln to burn. Incense is burned outside the kiln and candles are lit, bowing and kowtowing, and a rooster is slaughtered on the spot to sacrifice to the kiln god, and its seriousness is no less than in the past.

### Sharing a Boat in Stormy Weather

— He Jia Zhi

One One: The Enemy

Seeing Wei Yunqing in Weicheng, he looked shorter and older than before, and his face was even more distorted by the death of his son. When Weicheng thought of the suffering his family had suffered when Cuizhen was alive, he couldn't wait to clench his fists, immediately call Huanglong, and immediately beat this old and immortal fellow into a human pancake. But Mrs. Ye Er had already told him to endure it no matter what, so he gritted his teeth and had to put on a smiling face. Wei Yunqing cupped his hands to them, mother and son, and smiled, "Today is New Year's Eve, and there is a bit of odd money from the Ye family that has not been sent over yet, so I, the old man, have to take a trip. It's nothing for my old legs to take a trip, but since Shaoyun died, my spirit has been much worse, and I get tired after walking a few steps. Let me sit for a while." Mrs. Ye Er quickly called Ah Xing to bring him a chair to sit on, and asked, "Wealthy Wei, the money for that mortgage we agreed to pay back before the New Year, and I don't think there's anything else outstanding." Wei Yunqing quickly took out an account book from his blue cloth bag, flipped through it from the first page to the tenth page, and found under the account name of Ye Shidetang, on a certain day of a certain month, the final interest payment was six yuan, three corners, and one cent, and on a certain day of a certain month, the foreign exchange difference was three yuan, three corners, and two cents, for a total of nine yuan, six corners, and three cents. He shone the candlelight for Mrs. Ye Er to see. Mrs. Ye Er said, "I asked Ah Xing to send you the money, didn't we say that this final payment wouldn't be counted? We don't know anything about foreign exchange differences, how can you still hang on to this debt?" Wei Yunqing blew out the candle and smiled, "This can't be done. Little things add up, and numbers are accumulated from small amounts. How can you get a big number without small amounts adding up? Mrs. Er, Second Sister-in-law, our past friendship is not based on the thickness of these few pennies. Look at me, so cold, so late, so old, and still running around, you should know that you can't be shortchanging me." Weicheng really couldn't stand that face, so he sneered and said, "Who are you saving this money for in the future? If you're saying you'll marry a concubine and have a son, then you'll be waiting until the end of time." Mrs. Ye Er said, "Weicheng, don't be so serious with the old man, ten or eight yuan isn't anything. Wealthy Wei, I'll give you ten yuan now, I think, let this odd payment be your travel expenses."
