### Kharkov Front: Soviet Troops Launch Counteroffensive; Several Strongholds Recaptured in the Kalinin Region; Soviet Troops in Kerch Retreat to New Positions

A Soviet Border Region, 14th (Havas Agency) – Today marks the 326th day of the German-Soviet war. The current significant event is the renewed German advance, particularly noticeable in the Kerch Peninsula, which is crucial for advancing towards the Caucasus oil fields. The Soviet High Command appears to have adopted an offensive strategy as a diversionary tactic. Although the point of attack is a considerable distance from the Kerch Peninsula, there is a definite connection between the two. While the Soviet news agency has released information about the offensive, the exact location has not been announced. Military observers speculate that the Soviets intend to capture Belgorod, threatening German positions in Kharkov. This would aim to prevent the Germans from advancing on Rostov. If Soviet troops were to attack Kharkov, the German rear in the Donets region would be threatened, forcing them to move north. According to Soviet sources, Soviet troops in the Kalinin region, west of Moscow, have also launched a counteroffensive. After three days of fierce fighting, the Soviets have reportedly retaken several positions.

London, 14th (Reuters) – General Timoshenko's elite Red Army troops are advancing toward Kharkov (the key to the Caucasus). Soviet forces on the Kerch Peninsula appear to be retreating. The Vichy News Agency reports that German mechanized and cavalry units occupied Kerch City at dawn today. Meanwhile, the Soviet midday communiqué stated that fierce fighting continued overnight on the Kerch Peninsula.

Moscow, 13th (Havas) – The Soviet official communiqué released tonight stated that our troops on the Kerch Peninsula have retreated to new positions due to the enemy's numerical superiority. The German official report claiming that the battles in the area were favorable to the German side, with the capture of numerous prisoners and the destruction of many aircraft and tanks, is completely unfounded. Our troops retreated in an orderly manner and inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy. On the Kharkov front, our large-scale counteroffensive is proceeding smoothly. No noteworthy events occurred on other fronts.

Stockholm, 14th (Havas) – Regarding the reports circulating this morning from Romania that the German-Romanian forces had occupied Kerch and other cities, the authorities have neither confirmed nor denied them. The German High Command's battle report also makes no mention of this.

A Soviet Border Region, 13th (Havas Agency) – While some observers from neutral countries believe the importance of the battles on the Kerch Peninsula is somewhat exaggerated, the German advance there is sufficient to secure a crucial route to the Caucasus. Today, according to Romanian sources, it is confirmed that one of the three Soviet divisions surrounded on the Kerch Peninsula has been annihilated. Although the remaining troops are putting up resistance in several locations west of the Kerch Peninsula, their collapse is only a matter of time. As of now, the German-Romanian forces control both the northern and southern coasts of the Kerch Peninsula, except for a ten-mile stretch from the Sea of Azov to the Black Sea. Heavy fighting continues in the area along the Arabat Spit and the Black Sea coast, as well as the highway from Theodosia to the Kerch Strait. One unit of the German-Romanian forces reportedly reached a location four miles from the Kerch Strait yesterday. Neutral observers also believe that while the battle for the Kerch Peninsula is a major victory for the German-Romanian forces, the real first phase of the spring offensive will only begin after the German-Romanian forces cross the Kerch Strait.

German Forces Heavily Bomb Kerch Peninsula with Aircraft and Artillery

Berlin, 14th (Haitong Agency) – According to a German news report yesterday commenting on the southern front battles, never before have so many aircraft operated in such a small area. The German attack on Kerch is characterized by the extensive use of aircraft to support the advance.

London, 14th (Reuters) – According to a Reuters correspondent in Moscow, the battles on the Kerch Peninsula are mainly fought with aircraft and heavy artillery. The German attack front is only fifteen miles wide, with little room for maneuver for large numbers of tanks and infantry. However, although the forces used by both sides are small, the fighting is extremely fierce. The Germans are using heavy artillery and bombers to bombard Soviet positions, making it impossible for the Red Army to hold. The Soviet Air Force is also not weak. Earlier this year, the peninsula was defended by three or four infantry divisions and a tank division. The forces used in this offensive are unlikely to exceed this number. Crimea is now experiencing hot summer weather, and in the Caucasus region, farmers have already begun planting crops. As for the Soviet Army's diversionary offensives on other fronts, there are reportedly two locations: one in the Kharkov area, where, according to Moscow, the two armies have engaged in hand-to-hand combat, although the location of the fighting has not been specified; and the other in the Kalinin area, where, according to the Red Army newspaper "Red Star," Soviet troops have retaken one area and captured some prisoners. The German counterattack has been repelled. The newspaper also stated that fierce battles are ongoing in a certain area, and the Red Army continues to push back the Germans, but the Germans have greater numbers and are defending from mountainous terrain, giving them an advantage in both manpower and geography. It took two days of intense fighting to drive them back.

Fierce Battles Around Leningrad: Soviet Tanks Demonstrate Their Power

London, 14th (Reuters) – According to news from Moscow, Soviet troops on the Leningrad front are using heavy tanks in combat. The German forces are attempting to stop them with six-inch anti-tank guns. When these anti-tank shells explode, they generate a heat of 3,000 degrees. Soviet Voroshilov-type giant tanks have destroyed many of these anti-tank guns. The world's attention is now focused on Crimea, but fierce battles have also broken out around Leningrad. Soviet troops there have captured several new positions, and the food situation in Leningrad appears to have improved. Food convoys are now arriving in the city on schedule.

### German War Report

Berlin, 14th (Haitong Agency) – The German High Command announced today that after breaking through the enemy's defenses in the Baba region, our forces are now pursuing the fleeing remnants of the Soviet troops. The remaining enemy forces in the Ak-Monai area have been cleared. The enemy troops are now retreating along the Kerch railway and the coastal highway. German forces continue to pursue eastward. The enemy's resistance is extremely weak. Our forces have captured many prisoners and spoils along the way.

Berlin, 14th (Haitong Agency) – The first reports from war correspondents after the German offensive on the Kerch Peninsula have arrived. According to reports, the German forces launched their attack before dawn on Friday, preceded by heavy artillery fire and ground clearing by engineers to allow infantry to advance. At sunrise, large numbers of German bombers and dive bombers began bombing enemy positions, while a portion of the German troops landed in small boats at several points in the Feodosia Bay, attacking the enemy's flanks. Under the fierce German land, sea, and air attacks, the Soviet forces were unable to resist, and the German forces were able to advance rapidly. According to other reports from war correspondents, the roar of German artillery before the offensive caught the Soviets off guard. Before dawn, German engineers had prepared the advance route for the infantry, quickly clearing obstacles such as barbed wire and mines under the cover of smoke. In the narrowest part of the peninsula, the Soviet forces had built extremely strong defensive fortifications, such as barbed wire entanglements, minefields, flamethrowers, and steel bunkers. Therefore, the Soviet resistance there was also the fiercest. German troops charged forward, engaging in hand-to-hand combat, and crossed several enemy trenches. The Soviets, after recovering from their shock, ordered artillery to retaliate. At dawn, large formations of German aircraft also arrived to assist in the battle, bombarding enemy positions for several hours. Within three hours, all obstacles within the area of German advance had been cleared by engineers. The battle then focused on attacking the enemy's key defensive lines and fortresses. The enemy's machine guns, grenade launchers, anti-aircraft guns, and tanks were destroyed one by one by German forces. German artillery fire also heavily bombarded enemy bunkers. Before long, the enemy's key lines were completely occupied by German forces. The Soviet troops collapsed like a receding tide, and the German forces pursued them.

### Fierce Air Battles in the Far North of the Soviet Union; German Ships Gather in the North Sea of Norway, Attempting to Cut Off British-Soviet Shipping Lanes

Berlin, 14th (Havas Agency) – Berlin Radio announced that our air force was extremely active in the northern region of the Soviet Union yesterday. Enemy supply convoys and two railway stations in Murmansk were bombed. Our aircraft engaged in fierce air battles with enemy fighter squadrons, shooting down six Hurricane aircraft.

London, 14th (Havas Agency) – Well-informed sources here recently stated that a large-scale naval battle may occur in the northern seas of Norway. The German battleships "Admiral Tirpitz," "Admiral Scheer," and the heavy cruiser "Hipper" will participate, aiming to cut off the Soviet Union's vital supply lines in one fell swoop. The most dangerous area through which British convoys pass is near the German bases in northern Norway, North Cape. It is rumored that large numbers of "Focke-Wulf" four-engine aircraft have recently flown to that area from the ports of Trondheim, Narvik, and Tromsø. It may take British convoys four days to pass through this dangerous area, making it extremely difficult to defend against air raids.

### Chile Establishes More Aviation Schools; House of Representatives Passes Law to Control Transportation Industry

Santiago, Chile, 13th (Havas Agency) – A new aviation school established by the Ministry of National Defense near the El Bosque military airfield on the outskirts of the capital has been officially inaugurated and will soon begin training aviation cadets.

Santiago, Chile, 13th (Havas Agency) – The government has submitted a bill to Congress proposing to control the national automobile transportation and limit the daily office lunch break to only half an hour to prevent employees from traveling back and forth by car. The bill has been passed by the House of Representatives. It is estimated that this measure, once implemented, will save at least 250,000 gallons of gasoline.

### Earthquake Records; Location Either in Southern China or Near Central America

London, 14th (Reuters) – The renowned seismologist Shaw recorded a severe earthquake here this morning and believes that the earthquake occurred either between Burma and southern China or on the Pacific seabed near Central America.

### Japan Closely Watches the Eastern Front Battles

Tokyo, 14th (Domei News Agency) – Newspapers here have shifted their attention to the Eastern Front of Europe. According to a Berlin wireless report carried by the "Asahi Shimbun" today, the German offensive focuses on the use of new weapons and a large air force. One of the so-called new weapons is reportedly a flamethrower mounted on aircraft, used to counter Soviet tanks. The strength of Soviet tanks was initially underestimated by the Germans, so it was necessary to invent a weapon to defeat them.

### Hanoi, Vietnam, Experiences First Air Raid

Hanoi, 14th (Domei News Agency) – On Tuesday, enemy aircraft attempted the first air raid on Hanoi since the start of the war, but the attack failed. Of the five attacking aircraft, two were hit by intense anti-aircraft fire and crashed in flames. Hanoi residents remained calm during the first air raid and continued working as usual.

### Pacific Military Conference Convened in Washington; Reviewing and Coping with Future War Situation

Lisbon, 13th (Domei News Agency) – According to news from Washington, a Pacific military conference was held at the White House today, attended by U.S. President Roosevelt, lasting for one hour.

Washington, 14th (Reuters) – The Pacific Military Council met at the White House for an hour and a half yesterday, with President Roosevelt presiding. Song Ziwen, representing the council afterward, announced that the committee had discussed the quantity of production of military supplies and equipment and discussed the war in the Southwest Pacific. Canadian Minister to the U.S. McCarthy stated that the committee had also discussed the issue of some people arbitrarily talking nonsense, potentially providing important information to the enemy. President Roosevelt expressed strong views on the dangers of this matter. British Ambassador to the U.S. Lord Halifax stated that the President's remarks were not directed at any specific group of people, but were only a general warning, urging all parties to be extremely cautious during the war. It is very dangerous for those who do not understand the various facts to speculate arbitrarily.

### U.S. Trade Week, Day One; Secretary of State Hull Speaks, Reaffirming the Atlantic Charter

Washington, 13th – Today is the first day of U.S. Trade Week. Secretary of State Hull issued a statement reaffirming the principles of the Atlantic Charter, namely, that after the war, all countries in the world should have access to raw materials on an equal basis. When building a new world after the war, the United States has a heavy responsibility. If a general economic relationship for international trade cannot be established after the war, lasting peace and economic prosperity will not be possible. If the U.S. can clearly state that one of our war aims is to establish a sound economic relationship system, then our war effort will be even more effective.

### Japanese Ships Active in Australian Waters; Japanese Ship Sailing in South China Sea Sunk by Submarine

Lisbon, 14th (Haitong Agency) – According to a broadcast from a U.S. radio station in Melbourne, the Japanese Navy has again become active in Australian waters. Australians expect the Japanese to launch another attack soon.

Tokyo, 14th (Domei News Agency) – The Army and Navy Ministries jointly announced at 6:00 PM today that on the night of May 8th, a Japanese merchant ship in the eastern part of the South China Sea was sunk by a torpedo fired by an enemy submarine. However, it is believed that the submarine was also sunk by the Japanese Navy. The sunken Japanese merchant ship was sailing under the protection of warships, carrying passengers and people engaged in economic activities in various regions of the South Seas. After being hit by the enemy torpedo, it immediately caught fire. To date, 541 people have been rescued.

### Japan Explains the U.S. Air Raid on Japan

Tokyo, 14th (Domei News Agency) – The Army and Navy Ministries issued a joint statement tonight stating that the fact that one U.S. aircraft was forced to land in Soviet territory after the U.S. air raid on Japan on April 18th can be interpreted as an action intended to sow discord between Soviet-Japanese relations, which is quite noteworthy. The Japanese side must pay attention to this type of action by the enemy. The air raid on Japan is not enough to weaken Japanese morale, and the B-25 U.S. aircraft from North America attacking areas such as Tokyo, Yokohama, Nagoya, and Kobe are merely attempting to conduct psychological warfare. On the one hand, it is to alleviate the dissatisfaction within the United States with its defeats and to increase the confidence of Chongqing, India, and Australia in the U.S.'s war effort. However, this action fully demonstrates the predicament the United States is in and the growing dissatisfaction of the American people with the Washington government.

### Methods for Circulating Public Treasury Checks

Chongqing, 14th – It has been two years since the implementation of the Public Treasury Law, and public treasury checks are becoming increasingly popular. Recently, the Ministry of Finance has revised and announced the methods for circulating public treasury checks, making provisions for presentation, guarantee of circulation, and fraud prevention. The key points of the methods are summarized as follows: (A) The bearer may present the public treasury check to the paying bank for payment. (B) The paying bank, upon examining the public treasury check presented for payment and finding no illegal circumstances, shall immediately endorse it with the word "guaranteed" or equivalent, and shall be responsible for making payment at any time, regardless of the closing of the public treasury year. Public treasury checks that have been endorsed in accordance with these provisions shall be set aside by the paying bank in a separate reserve account within the original deposit account. (C) The following actions may be performed at the location of the guaranteeing bank with a public treasury check guaranteed by the paying bank, and may not be refused: (1) Payment of taxes, donations, and all legally levied fees by the people. (2) Payment of prices for transactions by government institutions and publicly owned businesses and industries. (3) Security deposits for public and private actions. (4) Payment of bank deposits; this transfer action shall not be effective unless the bearer has provided legal documentation. (D) If the issuing agency violates the provisions of Article 136 of the Negotiable Instruments Law when issuing a public treasury check and is discovered and punished, the head of the issuing agency and the responsible personnel shall be jointly liable. (E) If the paying bank is liquidated or bankrupt, the public treasury checks guaranteed by the bank shall have priority in receiving compensation. The implementation of these methods will provide various conveniences and preferential treatment to the people, and the circulation of public treasury checks will undoubtedly be promoted more smoothly in the future.

### Martinique Island Issue: Vichy's Reply to the U.S.; Contents Not Disclosed, But Door to Negotiations Remains Open

Vichy, 13th (Havas Agency) – Regarding the issue of French Martinique Island, it was recently officially announced that Chief Laval sent the French government's reply to the U.S. authorities this month. However, the content of the reply has not been disclosed. According to semi-official sources, on the 10th of this month, the U.S. government sent a note to the French government through Admiral Robert, High Commissioner of the French West Indies, requesting a change in the legal status of Martinique Island. However, the incident raised by the U.S. government is significant, involving several serious issues. After Marshal Pétain returned to Vichy, he carefully studied the issues. In recent days, government leaders have also repeatedly consulted with the commanders-in-chief of the army, navy, and air force, Darlan, Navy Minister Auphan, and Colonial Minister Brévié, regarding this matter. Therefore, the reply was not sent to the U.S. government until this month.

Geneva, 12th (Havas Agency) – A Vichy semi-official announcement today stated that the French government has submitted a reply to the U.S. government on the Martinique Island issue, but the content of the reply has not been disclosed. International observers here recently commented on this matter, stating that the French document mentioned that the actions of the U.S. have raised "serious issues." This suggests that it is not simply accepting the U.S. proposal. The difficulty lies not in the issue itself, but in the manner in which the U.S. raised the issue. However, although the French reply may not fully comply with all U.S. demands, it will not abruptly close the door to continued exchange of views. Regarding the West Indies issue, the French side has issued semi-official announcements twice. The first announcement stated that the French territories in the West Indies were already in a special status after the governments of France and the U.S. had provided mutual guarantees. The exchange of views on these guarantees had lasted for several months. Recently, the U.S. government suddenly raised some "demands" intending to change the current status and notified the French government on the 10th of this month. Today, the second announcement was issued, stating that the French government had sent a reply to the U.S. government. At the same time, the Martinique Island incident is an undeniable fact as a major international issue facing France. The various consultations conducted in Vichy over the past three days are of great significance. In short, the official response from France to Washington cannot be issued without the personal approval of Marshal Pétain. Therefore, the Marshal shortened his vacation and hurriedly returned to the capital to attend the meeting.

U.S. Attitude Apparently Becoming More Aggressive

Washington, 14th (Reuters) – Regarding the Martinique Island negotiations, the attitude here appeared to become more aggressive yesterday morning. Unless France guarantees that the ships stationed on the island will not be moved in the future and that the island's lookout bases are leased to the U.S., the U.S. government has no intention of signing any agreement with France.

Washington, 14th (Reuters) – As of late last night, the U.S. State Department had not yet received the three-page note regarding Martinique Island that Laval gave to U.S. Chargé d'Affaires Tuck in Vichy. The State Department also confirmed that the U.S. government did not submit a note in Vichy, but Admiral Robert, High Commissioner of French Martinique Island, continuously reported to Vichy in whole or in part.

Basic Principles of Vichy Policy

Geneva, 13th (Havas Agency) – International observers here recently analyzed France's international relations, stating that although the Martinique issue is France's most pressing international problem at present, France's current difficulties are not limited to one aspect. All these problems are extremely subtle when viewed from the special position France has been in since the armistice agreement was established in June of the year before last. Since then, the policy pursued by the French authorities has been a clear demonstration of Marshal Pétain and his cabinet's loyalty and patriotism. The basic principles of French policy are to maintain neutrality in this war, regardless of the conditions put forward by any of the belligerent countries, while maintaining diplomatic relations with the U.S. and maintaining normal relations with the Axis powers. In the Martinique Island incident, all efforts have been made to avoid the use of force. Judging from the fact that both sides are conducting negotiations through diplomatic channels, that is, through French Ambassador to the U.S. Henry Haye and U.S. Chargé d'Affaires to France Tuck, it is believable that neither side intends to create a deadlock. However, the occupied areas of France are pessimistic about the future of French-U.S. relations, believing that the relations are "extremely tense," which is quite different from Vichy's consistently hoping for a satisfactory solution. It is widely believed that the main key to the Martinique issue lies in the U.S. requesting to use the seven French oil tankers anchored on the island. The French government had previously agreed that Admiral Robert, High Commissioner of the island, should maintain the island's absolute neutrality. Chief Laval now seems to be going a step further, guaranteeing that the enemies of the U.S. will never use Martinique Island, so that the U.S. does not need to send troops to the island to guard it. However, the U.S.'s requisition of French oil tankers is not permitted under France's neutral status and is also inconsistent with the Franco-German armistice agreement, which is difficult to accept. At the same time as France is negotiating with the U.S., it must also deal with Germany. There is no doubt that the French and German governments are holding negotiations on the issue of bilateral relations. However, some news from various sources seems to be inaccurate, such as the rumor that Chief Laval and German Aviation Minister Goering met in Morain, on the border between the free zone and the occupied zone, which is difficult to believe. It is not certain whether Goering is even in France at present. This is because the current Franco-German negotiations are purely technical in nature, which can be seen from the arrival in France of the new German Armaments Minister Speer. Generally speaking, Speer's discussions focus on issues such as controlling manpower and raw materials and setting working hours. However, at a time when Germany is launching its spring offensive, it is not difficult to imagine that so-called technical issues are also not ordinary. At the same time, in Paris, Heydrich, a key member of the German Secret Police, is holding meetings with the French police authorities, and Brinon, the French government's representative in the occupied zone, is also participating. Afterwards, Brinon hurriedly returned to Vichy to report. Based on this, it can be seen that the Franco-German talks are multi-faceted contacts, with many issues and different levels of importance. However, no matter how complicated the Franco-German negotiations are, the background is still certain and not easy to change. In short, the main purpose is a fundamental adjustment of bilateral relations, with all issues leading to this end.

### Free French to Participate in Administration of Madagascar

London, 14th (Reuters) – The Foreign Office officially announced this morning that the Free French will assist in the administrative affairs of Madagascar.

### Papal Broadcast Appeals for Peace

Vatican City, 13th (Havas dispatch) - Today marks the 25th anniversary of Pope Pius XII's elevation to the episcopacy. He addressed Catholics worldwide in a radio broadcast, stating that there is currently no possibility of peace. He said, "I am constantly receiving appeals for help. From this, one can see what the world expects from the Church. All Catholics are asking us to use our influence to bring an early end to the current war. At this moment, blood and tears are flowing like rivers, spreading across the globe. We must find a way to achieve justice and lasting peace. In good conscience, I can say that since assuming the difficult task of Pope according to God's will, I have been actively striving to fulfill my duty. Regarding this great war, I have spared no effort in pursuing peace before it broke out and after it began, exhausting all my abilities and means. The people of all nations yearn for peace as much as a great drought yearns for rain clouds. I love the people of all nations impartially, and therefore, on the occasion of my 25th anniversary of consecration as a bishop, I appeal to you all. At this moment, it is difficult to offer concrete suggestions regarding the establishment of a just and equitable peace. If one compares the strengths of the two sides in the current world war, one will realize that there is no hope for restoring peace at present. One side in the war boasts of its past victories, while the other side holds unlimited hope for future battles. Therefore, the two sides are deadlocked, and the destruction of material resources is increasing daily, beyond calculation. I believe that all forces that can bring an early end to the current war must unite and work together. We are constantly concerned about the fallen soldiers, prisoners of war, and displaced refugees on both sides. The current situation is unbearable to witness. Family life is completely disintegrating, economic difficulties are rampant, and the people are suffering beyond description, almost constituting a catastrophe that endangers all of humanity. Throughout history, all countries have strived to solve social problems and improve the fate of the impoverished masses, but now, hundreds of millions of dollars are being used to manufacture tools for destroying life and property. Not only that, but behind this war, an even greater war is brewing, without end. Therefore, we must appeal to the major powers to never forget that the family is a sacred unit of organization, and it must not be ignored. Furthermore, families and schools must not be prepared as future battlefields. A large number of civilians have been displaced and have appealed to us, all of whom wish to return home and participate in the peace movement. However, we can only relay this message to the politicians of each nation, asking them to establish a glorious peace as soon as possible. Even if it cannot meet everyone's hopes, this peace would still be beneficial. If the politicians of each nation can accept this idea and take the lead, all of humanity will be endlessly grateful to them. We will also continue to earnestly pray to God for peace, and we should advise the people to awaken early and engage in various construction projects with a spirit of cooperation, so that a peaceful world can be established, where everyone can unite with love as the starting point. Christianity was extremely successful in the first and second centuries because of its deep faith. All believers were willing to sacrifice and endure suffering, engaging in various works and creating a fervent spiritual life, making unparalleled contributions to the unity of the Church. As for today's Church, it should also take the Church of the past as an example. Its victory will surely encourage us and make us believe that God's will will ultimately prevail throughout the world. The Church has become a "fortress of truth and self-salvation." We should unite behind the Church."

### Ancient Tomb of St. Peter Discovered

Vatican City, 13th (Havas dispatch) - When Pope Pius XII delivered his radio address today, in addition to appealing for peace, he also announced to Catholics worldwide that an ancient tomb, resembling the tomb of St. Peter, was recently discovered during the excavation of underground vaults in St. Peter's Basilica. The Vatican is greatly excited about this discovery, and further details will be announced soon.

### Philippine President Quezon Arrives in Washington, Welcomed Personally by Roosevelt

Washington, 14th (Reuters dispatch) - Philippine President Quezon, accompanied by his wife, daughter, and a son, arrived here yesterday. President Roosevelt, Stimson, Hull, and General Marshall, among others, went to the station to greet them. President Roosevelt's first words welcoming Quezon were, "I am immensely pleased to see you return safely to Washington." The two then engaged in informal conversation next to the President's car in the station square. Photographers gathered, busily taking pictures. Quezon and his family stayed at the White House last night and will move elsewhere later.

### US Representative to Norway Promoted to Ambassador

Washington, 13th (dispatch) - The U.S. representative to Norway has been promoted to ambassador, in order to demonstrate "the U.S. government's emphasis on the importance of the Norwegian government and people in the war," as announced by the State Department. At the same time, President Roosevelt has appointed Biddle as the first U.S. ambassador to Norway. From now on, Biddle will also serve concurrently as the ambassador to the exiled governments of Norway, Poland, Holland, and Belgium, as well as the minister to the exiled governments of Czechoslovakia, Greece, Yugoslavia, and Luxembourg.

### Bulgaria Requisitioning Building Materials

Sofia, Bulgaria, 13th (Havas dispatch) - The government issued an order today requisitioning building materials nationwide and mobilizing construction workers until October 30th of this year, in order to carry out extensive construction. In the major cities of Bulgaria, there is an insufficient supply of housing, especially in the capital, hence the necessity of taking these measures.

### British House of Commons to Debate the War Situation

London, 14th (Reuters dispatch) - Sir Stafford Cripps stated in the House of Commons today that the House will hold a debate on the war situation and joint planning on the first and second days of its next session, as previously promised. Whether the Prime Minister will participate in the war situation debate will be decided by the War Cabinet and the Prime Minister.

### Germany Invents New Type of Aircraft, Speed, Altitude, and Handling Surpass British Aircraft

Berlin, 13th (Havas dispatch) - The "Völkischer Beobachter" here recently published an article titled "Focke-Wulf Against Spitfire," comparing the strengths and weaknesses of German and British aircraft. It stated, in brief, that while the British and Americans often proclaim their air superiority, in reality, from April 21st to April 30th, Britain lost a total of 209 aircraft in the Strait of Dover, the Mediterranean Sea, and North Africa, while Germany lost only 45. Germany never wants to underestimate the value of British aircraft. The Hurricane and Spitfire are indeed excellent aircraft, but the German Messerschmitt 109 and Focke-Wulf 190 are even better. The Spitfire may be easier to handle than the Messerschmitt, but it is slower. British manufacturers try to take into account speed, altitude, and handling, while the German Messerschmitt 109 only focuses on speed and altitude. The newly released Focke-Wulf model is designed to correct the minor shortcomings of the Messerschmitt model. This aircraft has the basic advantages of speed, altitude, and handling, and can be considered the best of all types of aircraft.

### The Alaska Highway (6)

Readers may ask, if this area is so important, why didn't the United States begin developing it earlier, and why did it wait until the situation became critical to take hasty action? There are, of course, several reasons for this. The most obvious one is that the weather here is too harsh, and the area is remote and dangerous, so there seemed to be no need to prepare so urgently. However, the most important reason was the restriction imposed by the 1936 treaty, which stipulated that no fortifications could be built without permission. Despite this, the U.S. Navy, although hindered by the treaty, has never ceased its efforts in surveying and investigating for the past twenty years. Otherwise, it would not be so convenient to make arrangements today.

Now, the question is, since this project was started a year ago, when will it be completed? The answer to this question can only be speculated based on time. From February to August of last year, because the environment was not too harsh, perhaps it was proceeding according to the planned schedule. However, from August to December, it is likely that there was some stagnation; otherwise, why would there be rumors of building the Alaska Highway this spring? These rumors undoubtedly arose from the pressure of the times and the accelerated pace of work.

Impatient friends may say, why is this beauty being so coy? People have been waiting eagerly, but why is she still not appearing on stage? As mentioned earlier, firstly, her makeup is not yet complete, and she is busy applying powder and rouge, and so on; secondly, her attention is focused on the offensive issues in Europe, so she cannot satisfy the desires of the audience here.

Furthermore, she may never show her face on this side, and the reason is very simple: once the overall situation in Europe is settled, it seems that she does not need to personally appear on this small stage. As the saying goes, "one thing done, all things done," so why should she bother with this extra effort? Moreover, no matter how fierce you are, there is a set example in this war game - "kill three thousand, lose eight hundred." What if it's more than just eight hundred miles! Therefore, the beauty believes that it is best to focus her efforts on the West.

However, Alaska cannot be without adequate preparation. Since Hawaii has become the outer perimeter of American national defense, Alaska has immediately increased in strategic importance. If this area is not fortified, it will become the weakest link in the defense chain, wouldn't it be a big loophole?

The most regrettable thing is only this: such a vast wilderness as Alaska is truly a pure and unadulterated gem; the snow-capped mountains, the melodious pine winds, the leisurely deer, the pristine glaciers, the simple and charming Eskimos - everything is excellent poetic material. However, encountering this era of bloody storms, it is also filled with battle clouds and a murderous aura, even the glacial deposits of tens of thousands of years ago must be excavated. Is this an exposure of the inherent evil of human nature, or a catastrophe given to us by heaven as a punishment? (End of the article)

### French Concession to Establish "Civil Police," Divided into 266 Districts, Civil Police Quota Totals 5,000 People

French Consul-General in Shanghai, M. Charles, has issued an order authorizing the establishment of a civil police force in the French Concession. This new system will be implemented soon, and its methods are similar to the Baоjia system in the International Settlement.

District Unit

Regarding this point, the French Police Department has now formulated special methods to divide the entire French Concession into multiple districts (using a cluster of houses as a unit), and one person is selected from the influential residents or merchants of each district as the district chief. The district chief then selects two assistants, both of whom must be over 20 years old and have a definite occupation. The assistants should assist the district chief in general work and replace him in case of illness. The security of the district is the responsibility of the district chief and his assistants. The district chief may also appoint other auxiliary personnel, the number of which depends on the size of each district.

District Chief's Powers

Each district chief and assistant will be issued special identification cards and armbands by the French Police Department for identification. If they see any illegal activities in their district, or discover privately hidden firearms and weapons, and secret gatherings, they should report them to the nearest police station or patrolling constables. It is heard that all district chiefs in the French Concession have already been selected by the French Police Department, totaling 266 people, and 532 direct assistants have also been selected. The 5,000 civil police officers will be selected soon. The powers of the district chiefs will be clearly defined. If anyone obstructs the district chief in the exercise of his powers, they will be prosecuted. If the French Police Department finds that a district chief's service is unsatisfactory, it can appoint an assistant to take over the district chief's position. If the district chief does not perform his duties as instructed, the French Police Department can dismiss him. Residents who refuse to participate in civil police work must state their reasons to the French Police Department. If the reasons given are rejected, the person must participate in civil police work, otherwise they will be expelled from the French Concession.

### A Certain Society Allocates Funds for Education, Far-Reaching Intentions, Hoping for Resonance from All Sectors

Regarding the donation for educational aid from this newspaper, a certain society previously allocated 8,000 yuan from its funds, designated to prioritize subsidies for the children of teachers and journalists who are unable to afford education. Yesterday, it was entrusted to this newspaper. The reason why the initiator, Mr. So-and-so, specifically designated this fund for the children of teachers and journalists who are unable to afford education is of profound significance. It is believed that "the evolution of a nation, as well as its scholarship, morality, and character, are all inextricably linked. The quality of teachers is sufficient to influence the rise and fall of culture. Therefore, we must strive to ensure that teachers have a reasonable and stable life, so that they can focus on their work, and the status of teachers must be absolutely respected. On the one hand, we must also make teachers understand the importance of their own mission, constantly cherish a sense of self-respect, and devote themselves to the students they educate, so that they become useful talents for society, capable of shouldering the important task of national evolution. From one nation to the whole of humanity, all can achieve excellent evolution. This is indeed the highest goal that all teachers should strive to achieve together. Whether the education systems of various countries in the modern world are suitable or not is not discussed here. Only in China, since the abolition of the imperial examination system, the reform education advocated for decades has also been perfunctory, resulting in learning that is not used. Moreover, the general students do not understand the true function of education, thinking that graduation is to obtain a kind of right, and use this right to despise those who have not received education. They often have an air of superiority without realizing it. The decline of the national spirit in the past century cannot be said to be caused by the failure of education. This phenomenon not only harms the youth themselves, but also damages the entire nation. As for the news media, it has the task of enlightening the people. In our country, it has only a few decades of history, but the importance of its responsibility is no different from that of teachers. However, observing the news media recently, it is too focused on emotional reporting, and most of the news contains stimulation and impulsiveness. Regarding yellow news and erotic news, often in order to cater to the psychology of the general public, it records in exhaustive detail. Although it cannot be generalized, for the sake of the country and the nation, it seems necessary to correct it urgently. If teachers and the news media can work together to study their highest goals and fulfill their greatest responsibilities, then the country and the people will be able to achieve good results and embark on the path of excellent evolution. The society, in view of the importance of the above-mentioned relationship, has specially established two subsidy funds for teachers and journalists, using the income of the funds to subsidize their lives and achieve reasonable stability, which is also for the sake of the country and the nation. However, the funds are limited, and it is not easy to organize without gathering the manpower of the whole country. Due to the precariousness of the current situation, it is not possible to carry out the fundraising of expanded funds in a hurry, and it remains to be seen until the situation improves. However, within the possible range, we will do our best. I believe that there are many in the society who will resonate with Mr. So-and-so."

### Single Dollar Notes Are Indeed Sufficient, Speculation by Profiteering Merchants Should Stop

In order to regulate the supply of one-yuan notes in the market, the Joint Reserve Committee of Banks has, in addition to ceasing the redemption of damaged one-yuan notes, also prepared thorough measures, which have been implemented separately. Now, the one-yuan notes stored in various banks and money shops have been issued to circulate in the market, and issuing banks have increased the issuance of new one-yuan banknotes, thoroughly eliminating the panic of a shortage of one-yuan notes in the market. However, the illegal price gouging and manipulation by general small money exchange shops, as well as the deliberate hoarding of one-yuan notes for profit by rice shops selling at fair prices, have been actively investigated and dealt with by the authorities. It is heard that the Silver Money Industry Association believes that the one-yuan notes circulating in the market are, in theory, sufficient to meet demand, and there is absolutely no reason for a sudden panic of shortage. It deeply regrets those who manipulate prices for profit and hopes that, for the sake of all industries' transactions and the convenience of the public, they will not hoard one-yuan notes or engage in price gouging and profiteering.

### Subletting License: Another Extension Fee Added

The issuance of subletting licenses by the Public Works Department is still being carried out in the four districts of Central, Northwest, East, and West, but the number of people receiving licenses has greatly decreased. According to the records of the Revenue Department of the Public Works Department for the past two days, a total of 356 licenses were issued on May 12th, and a total of 343 licenses were issued on May 13th. "The Public Works Department has announced that the last grace period for the issuance of subletting licenses will be from today (May 15th) to the end of May. During this period, an additional extension fee of five yuan (totaling ten yuan) must be paid, along with the license fee of nine yuan and the plate fee of one yuan, for a total fee of twenty yuan. If the license is not obtained by the end of this month, legal action will be taken."

### Bandit Den Broken Up on Hongqiao Road, Abducted Victim Rescued

The Dahua Department Store at 853 Avenue Joffre, in the French Concession, is owned by Wei Xirui, a native of Shandong. At 4 p.m. on the 19th of last month, Song's seven-year-old son was taken for a stroll nearby by his hired maid, Zhong Wangshi, a native of Anhui, but they both disappeared. Later, Song suddenly received a letter from bandits demanding 50,000 yuan. Only then did Song realize that his son was not lost, but kidnapped. He immediately reported the information to the police for investigation. Until recently, the bandits sent another letter, arranging for someone to bring the money to the front of the Taishan Stone Factory on Columbia Road, at 2 p.m. the day before yesterday, where someone would contact them. After learning of this, the police, led by Inspector-General Gui Baoquan, Detective Zhou Buguang, Wei Yuansheng, and Detectives Yan Jinwen, Wang Tianyou, and Xing Shaoguang, went in disguise. The bandits resisted arrest and opened fire, and the detectives returned fire. A total of more than 20 shots were fired. As a result, one bandit was captured. He confessed his name as Wu Zhen, a native of Anhui, and said that the abducted victim was hidden at 19 Zhujia Alley, Yangjia Building, Hongqiao Road. At 5 a.m. yesterday morning, the detectives went there again and captured four bandits in the den: Jiang Zhifa, Xu Qifa, Hu Wangshi, and Hu Jinmei. They also rescued the abducted victim, Lin Bao, and the maid, Zhong Wangshi, and took them all to the police station. It is said that the maid is highly suspected in the case.

### Needles and Medicine from the French Military Medical Department Sold Off at Bargain Prices

Tonghui Elementary School at 253 Rue Massenet in the French Concession was established by the Shanghai Waterfront Workers' Union. The school has been established for more than 30 years, and the principal is Tang Guoxun, a native of Pudong. At the beginning of this month, the French Police Station in Lukahwei learned that in 1937, the French army stationed in Shanghai had borrowed the school building as a detention center for the retreating troops in Nanshi. In May 1938, when the French troops moved elsewhere, they left behind hundreds of boxes of needles and medicine from the military medical department. This spring, the prices of Western medicine in the city soared dozens of times, so they were sold off at bargain prices. Therefore, the French Police Department sent personnel to the school to investigate. The principal claimed that the needles and medicine had deteriorated and were discarded last winter. The French Police Department is currently conducting an investigation.

### Resumption of Shanghai-Philippines Remittance Communication: Overseas Chinese Businessmen's Urgent Hope; Livelihoods Worsening After Import Stoppage; Awaiting Communication and Remittance to Settle Accounts

Yesterday, a certain overseas Chinese leader from the Philippines in this city told our reporter that the trade relationship between Shanghai and the Philippines has always been extremely close. The goods exported from Shanghai to the Philippines are mainly cotton yarn and cloth, followed by hardware, and then enamelware, etc. The goods shipped from the Philippines to Shanghai are mainly timber, tobacco, coconut oil, alcohol, etc.

Traffic Stoppage Prevents Commerce

From the outbreak of the August 13th Incident to the occurrence of the European War, the export of Shanghai goods to the Philippines increased sharply. The reason was that the exchange rate of legal tender fell, which was quite beneficial to exporters. Imports remained unchanged, without major fluctuations. From the start of the European War to the outbreak of the Pacific War, the trade situation between Shanghai and the Philippines was not significantly different from before. However, since December 8th of last year, affected by the war, commerce between this city and the Philippines has completely come to a standstill. Telegrams between the two places stopped after last Christmas and have not yet been restored, and there is no shipping traffic either. There are quite a few overseas Chinese from the Philippines in this city. There are many engaged in tobacco, dyeing, weaving, and chemical industries in the business community. There are also many who have established import and export trading companies. After the suspension of trade between Shanghai and the Philippines, they have all been greatly affected.

Goods Intended for Exclusive Sale Sit on Shelves

Import merchants are unable to continue operations due to the disruption of goods' sources, so they have to close down or reduce staff to save expenses. Most exporters are suffering significant economic losses because goods cannot be shipped out, or goods have been shipped out but payments have not been received. What is particularly difficult are the factories operated by Filipino overseas Chinese in Shanghai, whose products were mainly sold to the Philippines. Therefore, the quality, style, color, and patterns were all designed to cater to the preferences of the people of the Philippines. Now, although the goods are滞留 in Shanghai, they cannot be modified for local sales. For example, Filipinos like to wear red and green undershirts and shirts, while most local people prefer to wear white. There are many examples of similar situations with other goods. Therefore, most of the factories established in this city by Filipino overseas Chinese have been forced to shut down or operate at half capacity. The impact on business is by no means small.

Children of Overseas Chinese Businessmen Temporarily Receive Assistance

Currently, the most difficult situation for Filipino overseas Chinese in Shanghai is for students. According to investigations, there are 389 Filipino overseas Chinese students studying in various middle schools and universities in this city, but the actual number is probably higher. These students who have traveled far to their ancestral homeland for education have always relied on remittances from their families in the Philippines. Since last December, remittances have stopped, and prices in Shanghai have soared, making life difficult. Their situation is very distressed. Currently, a group of Filipino overseas Chinese in Shanghai are raising funds in their private capacity to provide assistance to students with financial difficulties. University students can apply for loans of 150 yuan per person, and middle school students can apply for loans of 100 yuan or more per person. In these times of expensive rice and firewood, obtaining a loan, however small, may provide some relief. However, it is far from completely alleviating the difficulties currently encountered by hundreds of overseas Chinese students. What Filipino overseas Chinese in this city urgently hope for now is the early restoration of postal services, so that families of overseas Chinese living in Shanghai and the Philippines can report their safety to each other to alleviate anxieties; and the early restoration of remittances, so that outstanding business accounts between Shanghai and the Philippines can be settled, and overseas Chinese students in Shanghai can also receive assistance. As for the resumption of shipping and the continuation of trade, it is even more desired by the general Filipino overseas Chinese in Shanghai, and it is also closely related to the commercial future of this city.

### Paint Workers Demand Increase in Meal Allowance

There are more than 5,000 paint workers in this city, with a daily wage of 7.30 yuan. Recently, due to soaring prices and the difficulty of maintaining a livelihood, they collectively sent a letter to the trade association requesting an increase in the meal allowance of 6.70 yuan, quickly raising the total to 14 yuan per day. After receiving the workers' request, the trade association invited both labor and management for negotiations, but there was no progress after two attempts. Yesterday was the third negotiation, but the management was absent. The trade association will schedule another negotiation, and the labor side hopes for a satisfactory resolution soon.

### Record Concert

The record concert organized by the Symposium Club will hold its fourth concert on the 17th of this month (Sunday) at 4:00 PM at the Modern Gymnasium at 21 Route Corneille. The entire program will feature works by Johann Strauss. Members please arrive on time. Non-members can purchase tickets at the Modern Gymnasium for one yuan.

### Chase Bank Returns Remaining Deposits

Chase Bank in this port is now returning one-tenth of the remaining deposits as of December 6th of last year to depositors, with the amount not exceeding 2,000 yuan. Similar to other Allied banks in this area, British, American, Dutch, and Belgian expatriates are only allowed to withdraw 500 yuan per week, while other depositors can withdraw one-tenth of their deposits all at once.

### Social Tidbits

Using a False Name to Obtain Rice Money: Detective Li Yuyuan of the French Concession police station has received reports from various shops that someone is impersonating and selling rice, collecting deposits totaling a considerable amount, and requesting an investigation. Detective Li, based on the reports, led detectives No. 345 and No. 504 to start an investigation. They arrested Fang Kunbao (30 years old, from Wuxi) a few days ago and confiscated several silk armbands, bringing him to the police station for detention.

Tourist Jumps from Building and Dies: Yesterday afternoon at about 3:00 PM, a middle-aged tourist suddenly jumped from the rooftop garden of the Wing On Company's Great Rhyme Building on Nanjing Road, sustaining severe injuries on the spot. He was taken to the hospital by car, but died before treatment could be given.

Yesterday's newspaper was dispatched at 6:15 PM.

### The New Municipal Council Organization for Solving All Problems (3): The Work of the Coordinating Committee Affects Everyone

Only for Certain Goals

In Homer's epic poem "The Iliad," there is a hero who overshadows mountains and rivers, Achilles. His only vulnerable point is his heel. The pocketbook is the heel of the modern Achilles. Especially in these difficult times. To defend the weakest crack in our armor, the Municipal Council has established an eleven-member committee to suppress the general increase in prices. This is the Price Control Committee. Their day and night efforts are best described in the concise and clear words of the head of the committee, Mr. Fondekron: "We are doing our best to control prices."

The Initial Origin

To start from the beginning, the growth process of this committee is very interesting. In fact, its glorious future began in a simple form called the Rice Committee.

This was in the dim and distant past, exactly one year ago this month, when the Municipal Council first started transporting rice from Hong Kong. A small committee was formed. By November, his frequent revisions to the price of rice in Shanghai became the first piece of evidence of his growing pain. That was his first attempt to break through the web of manipulation by unscrupulous merchants.

After that, the situation changed dramatically, bringing many changes to the Municipal Council. The general increase in prices prompted the committee to significantly expand its scope. Flour, vegetable oil, and other daily necessities were added to its circle of activities. Plans were made to cooperate with the Importers and Manufacturers Association to formulate a method for managing general prices. At the same time, the Municipal Council also tried to transport flour and vegetable oil from other ports. It was at this time that the flames of war ignited in the Pacific, and the entire commercial transportation came to a complete standstill. This temporarily ended the gradually realized method.

Price Control Committee

If the events after the fateful decision in mid-December can be called a fundamental change, then the transformation of the Rice Committee is no less so. Starting with the name Rice Committee, it was followed by the Food Committee, the Food Management Committee, and finally the Price Control Committee.

Three of the eleven members of the Price Control Committee are directors, two of whom are also members of the Coordinating Committee. One is a representative of the Deputy Chairman of the Municipal Council. From this, one can get a glimpse of the importance of the committee.

In addition, the Price Control Committee also includes representatives from the French Concession, the Western District Special Zone, and the Greater Shanghai Municipal Government. Although the committee's scope of activities does not extend beyond the Public Concession and other areas, its purpose is clearly to seek consistency in price controls throughout Shanghai – which is certainly the most urgent requirement at present.

Multifaceted Work

The actual work of the Price Control Committee is almost as varied and numerous as that of the Coordinating Committee. The latter is the nerve center of the entire complex system, while the former is its heart. In terms of the supply of goods, the Price Control Committee always relies on the Japanese authorities. It negotiates with the Japanese authorities to import materials, telling them what is needed. During this visit, they pointed out that the Japanese authorities are making every effort to cooperate with the Municipal Council and provide all possible assistance.

The following are the members of the Price Control Committee: Mr. Fondekron (Chairman), Mr. Grote, Mr. Yasuzo Yajima (Manager of Nippon Yusen Kaisha Shanghai), Mr. Xuanping Huang, Mr. Jinqing Zhao, Mr. Chaddock, Mr. Beaufort (Representative of the French Concession), Chief Pan Da of the Western District Special Police Department, Dr. Juerden (Director of the Health Department), Dr. Bederson, and Secretary Wei.

### To Avoid Dangers in the Yarn Industry: Limit Fluctuations of "Double Horse" Brand to 300 Yuan

The cotton yarn market continues to be in good condition for spot goods, which is due to the increasingly depleted supply. As for 10-count coarse yarn, the foundation is particularly solid, and the number of buyers is increasing, because the price is cheap. The price of 20-count yarn is cheap by as much as 1,500 to 1,600 yuan, so buying it is more profitable and less risky. As a result, transactions are becoming more and more prosperous. 42-count "Blue Phoenix" yarn is priced at 14,300 yuan to 14,850 yuan, 42-count "Bao Guang" yarn at 13,600 yuan, 60-count "Colorful Ball" yarn at 25,900 yuan, 40-count "Golden Bridge" yarn at 12,000 yuan, 40-count "Golden City" yarn at 12,500 yuan, 60-count "Five Sons" yarn at 24,000 yuan, 32-count "Immortal Peach" yarn at 12,750 yuan, 32-count "Blue Phoenix" yarn at 12,750 yuan, 20-count "Blue Phoenix" yarn at 7,600 yuan to 7,850 yuan, 20-count "Yang He" yarn at 7,300 yuan, 20-count "Moon Qin" yarn at 7,000 yuan, 20-count "Double Tiger" yarn at 6,950 yuan, 20-count "Feng Nian" yarn at 7,200 yuan, 20-count "Water Moon" yarn at 7,300 yuan, 20-count "Double Horse" yarn at 6,700 yuan to 6,800 yuan, 20-count "Transformed Earth" yarn at 6,850 yuan, 10-count "Red Transformed Horse" yarn at 5,160 yuan to 5,350 yuan, 10-count "Boy Scout" yarn at 5,130 yuan to 5,300 yuan, 10-count "Red Bao Yi" yarn at 5,100 yuan, 10-count "Weaving Girl" yarn at 5,150 yuan, and 16-count "Red Bao" yarn at 4,500 yuan. The initial offering price of 20-count "Double Horse" factory singles was 5,600 yuan. At this time, short sellers and floating long positions rushed to sell, and the market eased to 5,380 yuan, but the bulls did not give up and pushed the price up to 5,630 yuan at the close. Recently, the price of "Double Horse" has been rising and falling wildly. Colleagues, in view of this situation, feel that it is too dangerous. After a discussion, the degree of rise and fall is temporarily limited to 300 yuan as the standard and may not exceed this limit.

### Coarse Cloth Has Little Honor or Disgrace

The factory cloth market was weak at the beginning and strong later, and the situation turned stable. Most coarse cloths of various weights had little honor or disgrace. 16-pound "Earth" cloth was still sold at 258 yuan, and 8-pound "Zhen Zhong" cloth at 135 yuan. Fine cloth was short in supply, with the "Da Peng" brand calling for a price increase to 246 yuan. "Fu Gui" cloth fluctuated around 225 yuan, "Peach Blossom" Shilin cloth made a high of 353.5 yuan, up 2 yuan, "New Family" Shilin cloth at 345 yuan, and "Prosperous Dream" mercerized yarn at 295 yuan. Longevity crepe at 7.6 yuan, all with transactions.

East cloth market continued to be firm and strong. 12-pound "Dragon Head" fine cloth new singles opened at 282.5 yuan in the morning, rose to 287.5 yuan at noon, and 288.5 yuan in the afternoon. The opening was as low as 6.5 yuan, but it eventually rose back to 287 yuan. The closing price of "Colorful Ball" fine cloth was 256.5 yuan, all rising by 1.5 yuan per bolt compared to the previous day. 4 Gentleman serge opened at 9.41 yuan in the morning and closed at 9.5 yuan in the evening. The situation was stable.

### Government Bonds Awaiting Price and Selling, Seller Sales Decreased Yesterday

The government bond grey market was weak again yesterday. Although sellers appeared, they were fewer. Buyers' appetite was therefore not very enthusiastic. The number of transactions was reduced by more than half compared to before. Although the seller has become an open secret, there are still some remaining goods. Whether all of them will be sold or how much will be retained, and the urgency of their nature, is of course what anyone wants to know, and it is also what anyone cannot know. However, waiting for the price to sell is an undeniable fact, and at least it will still be a sell-off when the price is high, but the strength of the multiple parties is indeed not to be underestimated and cannot be speculated. Yesterday, Tongli sold about 500,000, and Shunli also closed out multiple positions. Wuhe, Baolong, Yichang, Lianyi, Gongmao, Tongkang, and Tongyuan all had long positions increased or sold off. Jiufeng, Xiekang, and Hu Heji replenished or absorbed a lot. Zhongyi, Dalai, Zhongfu, Xinhua, etc. were all buying in. Hongda, Renfeng, Renchang, Runde, Hongxing, and Tongshun all had buying in. As a result, except for Category C, the market price returned to a small 2-3 cents to 1 yuan. The transaction was about 800,000 to 900,000 yuan. A concise table is listed below: Category Highest Lowest Closing Compared to Previous Day
Category A 65.6 64.6 64.6 Down 0.40
Category B 59.0 57.6 57.7 Down 1.00
Category C 58.1 57.4 57.6 Flat
Category D 52.8 53.0 53.1 Down 0.30
Category E 55.8 55.2 55.2 Down 0.20

(The lowest price for Category C the day before was 57 yuan, which was mistakenly written as 7 yuan and 10 cents. This is hereby corrected.)

### Stock Prices Rose and Fell Differently

Large Investors Sell Foreign Shares and Buy Chinese Shares

### Physical Goods Released, "Cooked Red" Further Declines

Yesterday, the spot price of "cooked red" in the grey market continued to fall, retreating to the 21,000 yuan mark, because the market price has been stable for a long time, and general depositors have entrusted cash shops to release physical goods. The market sentiment is soft. In the morning, each tael (10 liang) opened at 21,300 yuan, down 50 yuan. The gold shops had mixed actions, and the price retreated to 21,250 yuan, then rose to 21,400 yuan. After 10:10, the gold shops and silver shops competed to sell, and one shop also sold, and the price suddenly fell 550 yuan, retreating to within 5,100 yuan, with the lowest at 5,0850 yuan. Securities firms bought in, and the price saw a rebound. The last transaction price was 21,000 yuan, 350 yuan lower than the previous day, with a difference of 550 yuan. The transaction volume was not small.

Silver shops' jewelry was priced down by 100 yuan by Da Sun and its peers, at 2,150 yuan per tael (200 yuan discount for buybacks), patterned silver was priced at 18 yuan, and black market silver coins were at 9.45 yuan each, it is said.

### Discount on Postdated Checks Rises

The foreign currency market was stable yesterday. British and American gold pounds remained stable, with the former still at 500 yuan and the latter still at 510 yuan. US dollar notes were traded at 32 yuan, Hong Kong dollar notes retreated to 4.89 yuan, and military notes opened at 7.33 yuan in the morning, retreated to 0.27 yuan after opening, and finally closed at 7.3 yuan, up 4 cents compared to the previous day.

The discount rate on postdated checks rose yesterday, with each 1,000 yuan making 5 yuan, at 25 yuan and 30 yuan. The interbank lending rate of the Money Trade Association was still at 1.4 cents. The premium on Central Reserve Bank notes was 32.5 cents and 33 cents per yuan, it is said.

### Asia Bank Notes

Silver Preparation Council Acts as Agent for Exchange

The Shanghai Banking Industry Joint Preparation Committee issued a circular to various banks yesterday, stating that member banks of the same industry association that have not joined the exchange have now successively applied to the association to join the exchange. The Notes Exchange Committee of the association has resolved that all banks should follow the association's method of acting as an agent for member banks' notes exchange and that the association will separately set the date to begin acting as an agent for the notes exchange of each bank. It is hereby decided that on May 18, 1942 (next Monday), the association will begin acting as an agent for the Asia Bank's notes exchange and that Asia Bank will be assigned the number 51 in the exchange, it is said.

### Collecting Single Notes, the Route to Selling Rice is Cut Off

Rice shops want to take advantage of the situation to collect single notes, hoping to gain a profit of 1 dime per yuan in premium. Now that the price of foreign rice is out, 5 yuan must be pooled into one unit, and the price of rice is increased by 43 cents per liter, which is doomed to failure. It is hateful that the speculators are still harming others and themselves. However, the public has already suffered greatly from this, and they themselves have not been unaffected. Only caring about the present and not caring about the future is like a frog in a well, which is what today's speculation and hoarding are about. Looking back and reflecting, they will also sigh at what they have done.

### Interprovincial Transportation of Soybean Cakes Stopped

The arrival and sale of beans are both scarce, the market is idle, and the prices vary, with slight differences. For example, 100 bags of Chongming sand red soybeans were priced at 232 yuan, delivered, 228 yuan to 230 yuan, self-pickup, and 80 bags of sand silkworm soybeans were priced at 138 yuan, self-pickup, 141 yuan cash. 30 bags of Wujiang selected green soybeans were priced at 170 yuan, and 10 bags of Pudong Du soybeans were priced at 260 yuan.

Corn transactions were scattered, and the market showed a flat trend. For example, more than 100 bags of Wuhu corn were priced at 180 yuan to 182 yuan.

Recently, due to the impact of rural pacification, the interprovincial transportation of soybean cakes has been stopped, the number of transactions has been sharply reduced, and the market is generally quiet. For example, 1,500 Li Zi brand soybean cakes for delivery in May were priced at 69 yuan, and 52 yuan to 52.5 yuan in new legal tender.

### Daylily Largely Traded

Taiwanese Brokers Exclusively Buy 1,000 Dan

The daylily market price is too high, and all parties have been slow to dispose of their stocks, and the market has been silent for a long time. The Taiwanese brokers originally had a large appetite for transactions, but the market price was difficult to match, resulting in few transactions. Taking advantage of the market softening, they have started to collect a large amount. As of yesterday, they have traded 1,000 dan. The goods are ordinary, and the price is at 500 yuan. They will be shipped out soon, it is said.

### Dried Kelp Slips Back

The source of dried kelp is scarce, and the market stock is also lacking. The market price has once been high and constant, but high prices and sluggish sales are a natural trend, so the recent market has seen a slip back. Yesterday, the market price was 450 yuan, and the market was stable.

### Hoarding Cigarettes is Extremely Regrettable

The cigarette market has been weak in recent sales for more than a month. In the past, it had been soaring, but now it is lackluster, causing operators to be burned out. The rapid rise and fall make people unable to keep up. The large hoarding gangs are still holding on, and the general scattered retail investors are gradually selling off, with great regret. Yesterday, the market turned better. For example, the price of each box of "Great Britain" brand cigarettes was 9,600 yuan, up 300 yuan from the previous day. "Old Knife" brand was 7,300 yuan, "Pinhai" brand was 5,600 yuan, "Wuhua" brand was 5,000 yuan, and "Little Fairy" brand was 5,400 yuan, all up 100 yuan. The Japanese cigarette market turned for the better. For example, "Golden Gun" brand was priced at 1,880 yuan, with fewer sales, "Golden Mansion" brand was priced at 1,550 yuan, "Quanlu" brand was 2,550 yuan, and "Zhipu" brand was 1,550 yuan, all up by 50 yuan, it is said.

### Soap Market Regains Momentum

The selling price of daily necessities such as soap has risen again and again, because the season is right and the demand is strong. The factory has not yet announced any news of distribution, and the stock in the market is decreasing day by day. The owners are strong and tend to insist, so the price has soared again. For example, each box of "Gu Ben" soap was priced at 370 yuan, "Bai Xiangmao" soap at 310 yuan, "Huang Xiangmao" soap at 290 yuan, and "Arrow Knife" soap at 300 yuan, up 5 yuan to 10 yuan from the previous day. The match market is stable, and the selling price has not changed much. For example, "Phoenix" brand was 5,300 yuan, "Beauty" brand was 5,400 yuan, and miscellaneous brands were 4,500 yuan, all holding their original price. Western candles "White Li" were priced at 190 yuan, also flat.

### Price of Vermicelli Looser

Recently, the price of vermicelli has been looser due to sparse sales and looser asking prices from customers and sellers, so the market has fallen accordingly. The day before, Longkou vermicelli was down 10-20 yuan, and Qingdao vermicelli was down 10 yuan, and the market was flat and soft.

Spring Autumn

### Information on Hurricanes

— Zhu Ma

In coastal cities and towns, it's almost unavoidable to experience one or two hurricanes each year. They arrive suddenly, like a giant extending his mighty palm. However, preparation is possible; institutions like observatories exist to forecast and transmit such information. Usually, warnings are issued in advance, and customs houses hoist black balls to ensure ships dock, avoiding such attacks and devastation. Although observatory measurements are sometimes inaccurate, "being prepared is always better than frantically digging a well when thirsty."

However, according to news reports, this year's observatory cannot continue this work. The reason is the Pacific War, which has caused meteorological observatories on various islands to cease operations, preventing the transmission of hurricane information; news is blocked. This work of "knowing the heavens," which is both mysterious and interesting, now faces a depressing fate, limited to recording local weather conditions daily.

Experienced individuals tell us that late summer and early autumn are often the times for one or two hurricanes. Now that there are no forecasts, their sudden arrival is inevitable. If shop signs are reinforced with wire now, and fences are firmly rooted, even a sudden hurricane can be seen as revealing the quantity that is about to be swept away, because hurricanes primarily topple weak and small structures – this is also a fact.

With the obstruction of hurricane information, are these insignificant words likely to serve as a "black ball"?

### Shanghai Street

— Ban Gong

If Avenue Joffre is the Russian street of the Seven Seas, then I think Yu Qiaqing Road can be called the most authentic Shanghai street.

Is it necessary to rectify the name? What is called Shanghai Street is, of course, because its various aspects, whether beautiful or ugly, are sufficient to symbolize Shanghai today. For example, there are many celebrities on the Shanghai Bund. Mention the famous Ah De Ge, and probably in Little Paris, everyone would say, "Who doesn't know him? Everyone knows!" Shanghai has Avenue Edward VII, but we know that foreign countries also have Avenue Edward VII – but think about it, would England or the United States have a Yu Qiaqing Road? Would Tianjin or Beijing have an Ah De Ge Alley? This name is cleverly chosen! Isn't this a road that only Shanghai can have?

It is also said, "The name is the guest of the reality." This road name indeed seems to have some Shanghai characteristics. Let's see what the reality is like.

Is there anything that can better represent Shanghai today than Yu Qiaqing Road?

During the day, there are many bums. At night, there are many prostitutes; at night – look at these hotels. Every day, you can see so many dramas! You can write so many compassionate articles! Wandering around the street are countless "scum of life," hungry, beaten, dying. You don't want to see or hear, but the tragic wails are increasing, and the ugly corpses are blocking your way every day! You hate them, but they just won't die!

At the same time, this place can be said to be a collection of Shanghai entertainment. There are magnificent cinemas; there are dance halls; there are also Suzhou people entering and leaving bookstores, Ning Shao people flocking to the "Di Du Ban"; there is European and American cuisine, and there is also red date soup—and there is also a long queue for buying rice.

Shanghainese like to make a fortune, and there are plenty of lottery tickets for sale here. Shanghainese—from rough maids to bank tycoons—all like fortune-telling, so there are mountains and children waiting here to calculate your fleeting years and look at your complexion.

On this road, you can meet all kinds of people. You can see wealthy people with swollen heads and bulging intestines staggering out of restaurants, and you can see several young ladies from Third and Fourth Roads speeding by in chartered cars, dazzlingly dressed, making you feel bright-eyed. You can even see the rarest elegant scholars in Shanghai; perhaps they just came out of the Daxin Art Gallery or the Ningbo Fellow Association after seeing calligraphy and paintings, and unfortunately, they turned a corner and ran into this unbearably vulgar road. As for road heroes and street heroes, they are even more endless and countless.

Two completely different worlds are separated by only a wall here! On this point alone, isn't Yu Qiaqing Road worthy of being called Shanghai Street?

### Sharing the Storm

— He Jia Zhi

(5) Repaying Favors

Cui Zhen left, and Wei Cheng sat and meditated for a while, thinking that Cui Zhen was just born into a poor family, and her situation was so bad. If she were in Guo Fang's place, with her cleverness and eloquence, she might be even better than Guo Fang. He turned off the lights in the Shuangmei Study, crossed the empty courtyard, and returned to his bedroom. He only felt a shadow flash, which frightened him. He asked, "Who is it?" Someone answered: "It's me, Brother Cheng. Xi Que's hot water bottle's water has cooled, and she didn't even know to change it, so I changed it for you." Wei Cheng said, "Come here." Wei Cheng first walked into the bedroom, and Cui Zhen just stood inside the door, no longer moving her feet. Wei Cheng said, "I really should thank you; you take care of all my affairs." Cui Zhen said, "I was just afraid that Brother Cheng would thank me, so I hurriedly slipped out. I didn't expect that being sneaky would scare Brother Cheng." Wei Cheng said, "Now my gratitude outweighs my fear. Sister Cui Zhen, sit for a while before you leave." Cui Zhen said, "No." Wei Cheng said, "I have so much to ask you. Is Aunt asleep?" Cui Zhen said, "Yes." Wei Cheng said, "What about Xi Que?" Cui Zhen said, "She's asleep too." Wei Cheng said, "What about He Ma?" Cui Zhen said, "She went to bed early." Wei Cheng said, "Sister Cui Zhen gropes around alone inside and out; aren't you afraid at night?" Cui Zhen said, "What's there to be afraid of? Grandmother treated me well when she was alive. I still treat her as if she were alive, sending her food every day." Wei Cheng said, "You're right; there's really nothing to be afraid of. Is Aunt asleep?" Cui Zhen said, "She's asleep." Wei Cheng asked again, "Is Xi Que asleep?" Cui Zhen said, "Brother Cheng, you've asked twice. See you tomorrow."

Cui Zhen pulled the door to Wei Cheng's room, and the sound of footsteps faded away gently. Wei Cheng thought of what Cui Zhen said, that although Grandmother was dead, she still treated her as if she were alive. That's right: although Sister Cui Zhen is gone, he still treats her as if she were standing there: big eyes; fluffy hair; clothes with the scent of soap, all as if they were in front of him. He lay down, and suddenly someone came to knock on the door. He didn't go to open it himself, but the person who knocked on the door had already come in. He thought it was Cui Zhen, but it turned out to be Guo Fang. Guo Fang was followed by Guo Qi, who said with a bitter face, "You've lost your mother, but we've lost our father." Wei Cheng let out a cry, "Ah!" This cry woke him up; it turned out to be a dream. (76)

### Tragedy and Comedy

— Jin Yi

A friend of mine suddenly fell ill in this era and this year, and it was a serious illness. To say "serious illness" means that his life was on the edge of "life" and "death." Entering the hospital made his family laugh and cry, because when the doctor wrote a prescription, no pharmacy didn't answer "sold out." Fortunately, in addition to "treating the disease," the doctor also knew the whereabouts of the medicines and posted a few lines of "seeking" advertisements before snatching his life back from the "brave men."

However, "treating illness" is more difficult than "fighting fire" because the roundabout and time-consuming process of seeking medicines prolonged my friend's serious illness for three months, and he was only recently discharged from the hospital. When I went to visit him at his home, his greeting gift was: "Unfortunate to get sick, even more unfortunate not to die!" - These two sentences are worth a million-word tragedy.

Recently, I suddenly read in the newspaper a news story about a fire caused by hoarding medicine, but "firefighting" was for "treating illness." - This news seems to be a comedy.

### The Extinction of Humanity

— Xu Xi Zhen

According to physics, a magnet will lose its magnetism after being subjected to violent vibrations or impacts. Now, after these difficult years, as far as we can see, humanity seems to have the same phenomenon as magnetism to magnets in some inferior humans: Under the constant training of difficult times, under the material and spiritual shocks and blows, they have lost their original thin layer of humanity that was only attached to the surface. In our filthy land, these humans who have extinguished their humanity are exhausting their life's tricks to make various shocking and eye-catching performances in front of us, sometimes simply unbelievable. Hoarding materials, manipulating the market, and collecting single notes, making the lives of most people fall into even greater difficulties; and on the other hand, "profiting from business, trampling on young prostitutes," so that the abused are "unable to bear the insult, and their fragrance disappears," or selling girls and transporting them to other places,"... All of this shows that all the despicable humans who have lost the minimum conscience, lost the minimum sense of shame and self-esteem, not only extinguish their own only humanity, but also try to extinguish the lives of others, extinguish the shame and self-esteem of others.

On one side is the shock of the times, and on the other side is the charm of money and profit. Humans are being trained under these physical conditions of high temperature and vacuum pressure, so that some people with unhealthy souls cannot maintain their humanity. All these inhuman manifestations are astonishing; but the other part of the people who are willing to maintain humanity do not need to be frightened by these inhuman acts. When I was a child, I read some novels about gods and monsters, and I probably knew that some fox ghosts transformed into human forms were afraid of wind, rain, thunder, and lightning; the dramatic changes in nature often made it difficult for them to maintain their illusory human form. Under a burst of lightning, they always "roll on the spot and show their original form." And after the fire is over, they can never transform into human form again. This is really a bit "terrifying."

Let us stand in the wind and rain, looking as embarrassed as drowned chickens at those fires one after another. We want to see how many are still able to maintain their true human form, maintaining a humanity that cannot be extinguished by shocks after the fire has passed?

This is a great tragicomedy, and we are not only the audience of the open-air theater in the wind and rain, but also the actors in this wonderful show.

Look, you play – you!

### Single Notes Plus One

— Fu Min

Since there has been a shortage of single notes in the market, the use of five-yuan and ten-yuan bills has been inconvenient. Yesterday, the author went to a certain company to shop and saw a sign posted on the wall: Single notes in and out, calculated plus one.

This is a very good method. Customers are not unable to buy goods because the quantity of shopping is small; the store can also do more business, and both buyers and sellers are convenient.

(Editor's note: Many stores have now implemented the "plus one" method, although it cannot completely solve the single note shortage, it can also save the trouble of running to the money shop, and looking at the faces of the cigarette exchange shop owners and tram conductors.)
