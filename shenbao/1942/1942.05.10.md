### In the Coming Weeks, Australia Faces a Critical Moment; Pacific War Reaches a Grave Stage; Australian Prime Minister Curtin Addresses the Nation

Canberra, 8th, Havas News Agency: Australian Prime Minister Curtin delivered a broadcast address to the nation today, stating, "I must inform you that in the coming weeks, there is a possibility of all-out war, which will shake the entire world. Events related to Australia's survival will occur in the coming weeks, and we must prepare accordingly, especially as the threat of attack could materialize at any time. Today, the Pacific War has reached a grave stage, and significant events are imminent. I have frankly declared in both Houses of Parliament in the past that without sufficient naval and air power, initiating an offensive from Australia would be futile. Assuming we cannot hold Australia, launching an offensive is out of the question. In short, our wartime economy must be developed to the maximum extent. Our country is currently in a race against time, and many difficulties remain that we must find ways to resolve."

Stockholm, Sweden, 9th, Haitong News Agency: According to news from Canberra, the excitement of the Australian people caused by the initial American reports of the Battle of the Coral Sea has gradually decreased due to the second speech given by Australian Prime Minister Curtin yesterday. The Australian Prime Minister stated in the House of Representatives that the ongoing battle possesses a decisive military importance in the future Pacific War. He refused to issue statements regarding the outcome of the battle, only saying that the results of this battle will be sufficient to enable the Japanese military to determine future war strategies for Australia. The Australian Prime Minister also gave a broadcast address to the nation on radio, and his words were especially frank. He said that Australia is now in its most dangerous period, and that the outbreak of war in the coming weeks is sufficient to shake the world, and that the invasion of Australia could materialize at any time.

### The Alaska Highway (2)

The scenery, landforms, population, and products of Alaska, etc., have all been given a rough introduction. Now, let's raise a question. Why did the United States only think of building a highway in Alaska now, when it has some military value? And what's the use of building a highway?

Explaining this question clearly is not a simple task. Previously, in "Turkey's Moat," the reader was asked to watch a pantomime. This article begins by talking about the romance of the Yukon River, and now it will collect some fictional material for the reader to chew on for a while.

Let's start with people: Everyone has a special characteristic. This special characteristic, according to novel analysis, is personality. For example, the British gentleman's characteristic, the African black man's dull characteristic, and the Indian's characteristic are all personalities. Americans also have their own personality. The American personality is sometimes said to be slick, but sometimes it seems like a big idiot; sometimes it's said to be lively, but sometimes it's very stubborn; sometimes it's said to be a businessman who likes to haggle, but sometimes it's very generous; sometimes they are taken advantage of, and they are as obedient as grandchildren; but when the time is right, they are as fierce as rabid dogs. When you first meet them, they always act like harmless fools, and they can take whatever you throw at them; if you think they are really stupid, then you are the real fool, because they understand everything in their hearts, but they are just pretending to be fools.

But what exactly is the American personality? It's hard to say. We can only say that they like to be big tycoons; although they like to say a few boastful words, sometimes they really show you some tricks. They also like novelty and like big plans, doing things on a large scale. The previous European war showed all of these personalities. Of course, they also want to do something like that this time, but the circumstances of time and place are not the same as they were then, so they have not yet made an appearance. A few days ago, there seemed to be some "news," and nervous people were spreading rumors to each other, thinking that this late-arriving American had already appeared. This is because they wanted it too much, and they didn't realize it was too early. She is still "putting on makeup," and she won't come on stage until she's finished. As for that little bit of news, it's just a small "gimmick" for passers-by to joke around with.

So, what exactly are the Americans doing? What happened to the Alaska Highway that was mentioned a few months ago? "Only the sound of footsteps on the stairs, but no one coming down;" what's going on?

We can't treat Americans as Cheng Yaojin, who doesn't care about anything and just starts with three axe blows. They will never be so reckless. Although they look so silly, they are very calm when it comes to national affairs. Their process is a trilogy - one, two, three.

If we were to give each part of this trilogy a name, we could say that the first part is from Panama to Alaska, the second part is from collecting scrap aluminum to flying fortresses, and the third part is 1943.

### University of Alaska

This northernmost institution of higher learning in the United States, only one hundred and fifteen miles from the Arctic Circle, had only six students when it first opened in 1912, and now has two hundred. The school is located on a small hill, not far from Fairbanks, with many fertile farms and forests.

### Fighting Still Ongoing on Madagascar; British Foreign Office Announces Five Proposals; Rumors Say Island Will Be Transformed into a Base

Vichy, 8th, Havas News Agency: At 5 PM today, official telegrams received here from Madagascar stated that the resistance on the island is still ongoing. As for the garrison at Diego Suarez port in the north of the island, they are currently in negotiations with the British military. The conditions are still unknown here. At present, fierce fighting is still taking place in the mountainous areas south of the port. In short, the cessation of resistance in the Diego Suarez and Antsiranana regions does not mean that the entire island has unconditionally surrendered or accepted the ultimatum presented by the British military upon their entry into the scene. The Governor of Madagascar, Annet, had announced his determination to resist any landing attempt by the British military. The issue of the island cannot be considered resolved simply because of the fall of Diego Suarez port. At the same time, news from the island is awaited with great anticipation here. Government leaders are in constant contact with Colonial Minister Pléven.

London, 8th, Havas News Agency: Regarding the French Madagascar incident, the Foreign Office released a communiqué stating, "When our forces first landed in Courrier Bay, and had not yet encountered active resistance from French forces, our commanding officer was instructed by the government to present the following proposals to the French authorities on the island, requesting them to cooperate with us and avoid unnecessary warfare: The sovereignty of Madagascar still belongs to France, and will be returned to France as soon as the war ends. All military and government officials who express their willingness to cooperate with the Allied nations will continue to receive their salaries and pensions as usual. On the other hand, those who refuse to cooperate with us will be sent back to their home country once transportation is restored. The Allied nations will restore trade with the island and provide economic convenience, just like other French territories willing to cooperate with the Allied nations. The only condition for implementing the above measures is that all military and ordinary equipment must not be damaged in any way, and must be operated by French personnel as usual."

British Forces Take Over Military Port Facilities

London, 9th, Havas News Agency

According to press reports, the British forces landing on Madagascar began taking over various facilities at the Diego Suarez military port in the north of the island yesterday before noon, led by light tanks and armored vehicles.

Vichy, 9th, Havas News Agency: French Air Force Captain Assolant, known for participating in trans-Atlantic flights, fought against British planes in the skies over Madagascar this time and has not returned since. It is likely that he has been killed in action.

Vichy, 9th, Havas News Agency: There are various rumors about the terms of the armistice at Diego Suarez port in Madagascar. Well-informed sources here are still unaware of them, but say that the surrender of the port is purely military in nature and has no political significance.

Stockholm, Sweden, 9th, Haitong News Agency: According to news from London, the work of transforming Madagascar into an Allied base will soon begin. Military reserves and war materials are already waiting in several seaports in Africa. London has publicly acknowledged that the administration of the island will be taken over by Tegorpe, so that administration will not be interrupted and the Allied military operations will not be hampered. British newspapers are competing to publish articles from New York newspapers advocating that the U.S. military should occupy Martinique, Guadeloupe and other French colonies. Washington officials are still silent on this matter and seem unwilling to openly break off relations with Vichy.

U.S.-French Relations Show Slight Improvement

Washington, 8th, Havas News Agency: The Navy Department announced that the U.S. military did not participate in the fighting near Diego Suarez port or elsewhere on Madagascar. The rumors circulating in London that the U.S. military had arrived on the island are untrue. We would like to solemnly declare that there are no U.S. troops on the island at present.

Vichy, 8th, Havas News Agency: After the United States denied direct participation in the attack on Diego Suarez port, the slight improvement in relations between the U.S. and France has been clearly proven by this denial. According to political figures here, the reason why the United States insists on this position is probably because the leader Laval recently made a statement saying, "France does not want to be the first to initiate anything in the final stage of U.S.-French relations." The White House, of course, does not want to bear the responsibility for severing diplomatic relations between the two countries. The tone of the American newspapers has also softened slightly in recent days. What is most noteworthy is the article by the famous reporter Lippmann, published in the New York Herald Tribune yesterday, strongly arguing that the United States should not act rashly towards France. The significance of this is especially great.

Stockholm, Sweden, 9th, Haitong News Agency: It is rumored that President Roosevelt intends to send an ultimatum to the authorities on Martinique, demanding that the French aircraft carrier "Béarn" (23,346 tons), the light cruiser "Émile Bertin" (5,886 tons), and the "Jeanne d'Arc" (6,496 tons) anchored on the island be disarmed. The truth remains to be verified.

Stockholm, Switzerland, 8th, Havas News Agency: The "Geneva Tribune" recently published a telegram from its correspondent in London stating that British political figures are closely watching the development of U.S.-French relations, and are very pleased with the U.S.'s efforts to avoid the situation from becoming more serious. They also acknowledge that the French government leader Laval is also making every effort to avoid breaking off diplomatic relations with the United States. The "Basler Nachrichten" also published a telegram from its correspondent in London stating that Britain believes that the war on Madagascar is over, and that the speed of this progress is completely in line with the original expectations. The British side hopes that the time of conflict between the two sides will be as brief as possible, so as not to arouse animosity. From an emotional point of view, almost no one in London sympathizes with France. Prime Minister Churchill did not express sympathy for France in his speech in the House of Commons. However, all parties have stopped attacking Darlan and no longer speak of American intervention. According to the general impression, the current conflict on Madagascar should not be regarded as an act of war.

### Air Battle Occurs in Northern Soviet Union; No Changes on Land

Enemy aircraft and submarines repeatedly attacked Italian convoys in the Mediterranean without success; our ships all safely reached their destinations.

### British Foreign Secretary Eden Delivers Speech in Edinburgh; Looks Forward to a New Post-War World; To Build an Economic System with All Nations

Reuters, Edinburgh, 8th – British Foreign Secretary Eden delivered a speech in Edinburgh tonight, looking forward to a new post-war world. The Foreign Secretary said, "We must sacrifice for peace. Before the outbreak of this war, we saw global fear and trembling, and after the war began, progress was extremely rapid. In the post-war world, there is no room for isolationism, selfish policies, or policies of suspicion towards neighbors. The British Empire can no longer adopt an isolationist policy; it must share the responsibility of leadership with other nations. We can no longer forget armaments, the meaning of peace, which cannot be represented by national borders or peace treaties; it must have strength and will. However, if the world cannot establish an economic system that provides work for men and women and provides them with the compensation they deserve, then there will be no peace on Earth. The Allied nations, working together, will possess the powerful strength necessary to take on the responsibility of policing, maintaining peace, and the major responsibility of post-war economic reconstruction will rest on the shoulders of Britain, America, China, and the Soviet Union."

### New Governor of Malta, Gort, Takes Office

In addition, Major General Sir Juanting, an officer under Lord Gort, has been appointed commander of the British forces in Gibraltar.

### Madagascar (3) - Economic Overview

Madagascar experienced a significant economic crisis in 1927. The social conditions at that time were bleak, and the people’s livelihood was destitute. However, thanks to the intentional efforts of the ruling authorities over the years, the island has gradually recovered. Now, when a traveler from afar arrives in Antananarivo after a long train journey, he will be amazed by everything he sees. There are clean, wide asphalt roads, and tall, lush coconut trees sway gently in the tropical monsoon winds. On the quiet streets, he will see groups of local women wearing brightly colored dresses, smiling as they pass by. They have dark skin. Of course, you cannot compare them to a spoiled woman raised in Paris, but if you look at them with a different aesthetic eye, you will find that they have another kind of pure and simple beauty. They dance lightly, sing, and laugh during festivals. You may have come from those bustling cities, constantly oppressed by the noisy air and experiencing a suffocating pain. Then Antananarivo - this beautiful tropical city - will bring you another kind of freshness and vitality.

Madagascar is an island based on agriculture. Due to the suitable climate and fertile soil, the annual output is substantial. In particular, the soil along the plains near the Mozambique Channel in the eastern part of the island is of the highest quality. Farmers mostly cultivate during the rainy season and harvest after the dry season ends. Plants cultivated in this way generally have excellent yields. The main agricultural products in this area are rice, sugarcane, and cotton. Half of the total annual output is exported to the European continent.

The central plateau area, because of its higher altitude (averaging over 1,000 meters above sea level), is suitable for growing wheat, similar to the situation in Central Europe. This area is also a flourishing fruit cultivation region. In recent years, fruit varieties brought from France have been tested, and fruits such as apples, pears, grapes, and apricots have all produced excellent results. As for the northern part of the island, due to the hot climate, it is most suitable for planting coffee, cloves, and other spice plants during the rainy season.

Speaking of rice, this is the most important food for the islanders. Green rice paddies are scattered all over the island, especially in the Morovav area, which is a land of plenty. In the past, Madagascar once experienced a severe rice shortage, and a large amount had to be imported from Asia every year. Moreover, due to the backward agricultural technology at that time, the quality of rice was also uneven. However, since the selection and cultivation of specialized agricultural talents, Madagascar's rice production has not only become self-sufficient but has also become a major rice-producing region in the world. As a result of continuous experimentation, the quality of rice can now be compared with products from Malaysia and other places.

As a staple food for the islanders, there are also manioc (a type of Euphorbiaceae plant), beans, and taro. As for corn, the yield was very small in the past, but because the demand from neighboring islands was very high, the cultivation of this food attracted the attention of farmers on the island.

Animal husbandry, which is closely related to agriculture, also occupies an important position in the lives of the islanders. In the countryside, we can see almost all tenants raising livestock such as pigs and cattle. The vast grasslands in the Betsiles and Vohemar areas are the most ideal pastures. The islanders in the west regard livestock as their most important property. The most common animal raised in Madagascar is the zebu, a heavy and lazy animal with a huge body. If raised properly, its weight can often exceed 800 or 900 kilograms.

Everyone knows that Madagascar is a region rich in mineral resources. They may first mention the gold mines here. In the past, gold mining almost became the main occupation of the islanders. But the reserves of gold mines are not inexhaustible. According to statistics, the output in 1912 was 1,996 kilograms, but with long-term development, the current output is less than 100 kilograms, a sharp decrease of 20 times in 30 years.

In fact, the most important mineral on the island is graphite, which is an indispensable raw material for the prosperous electrical industry of the 20th century. Apart from Sri Lanka having a large output, Madagascar is second only to it in the world. This mineral is mostly concentrated in the Antananarivo area, with an annual output of about 30,000 tons.

Madagascar is also a place with rich nickel ore reserves. Nickel ore is the most urgently needed raw material during wartime. According to reports from surveyors, the Vaiazoro area of Madagascar is estimated to be able to extract 400,000 tons of pure nickel per year. This is a very rich resource.

In addition to the above, Madagascar also produces iron, coal, oil, and a small amount of radioactive substances, but they are less important, so they are omitted.

However, before the issuance, if any Chinese residents need to pass through the Japanese military checkpoint on the four borders of Shanghai, they can fill out a special application form at the governing police station to apply for a temporary pass. The application form must include the name, age, gender, occupation, address, purpose, and destination of the applicant and must be guaranteed by the householder or a merchant who has obtained a business license. If the application form does not meet the above requirements, the application will be rejected.

### Celebrating Parents' Day Today

Church Services Held by Christian Churches

Today is the second Parents' Day. Christian churches and church schools in Shanghai will hold Parents' Day services and celebrations today. In addition, Parents' Day flower sales will be held. Those with both parents alive wear red flowers, those with deceased parents wear white flowers, and those with a deceased father or mother wear blue flowers. The price of each flower is one yuan. All proceeds will be donated to charitable organizations such as poor children's homes and orphanages. Parents' Day was initiated on April 15, 1941, at a meeting of the National Christian Council of China. Its greatest purpose is to cultivate healthy parents, produce healthy children, and create a healthy country. At this difficult time, there are parents in distress and suffering everywhere. On this Parents' Day, we should not forget to help parents in distress and practice the principle of "love my parents and extend that love to the parents of others."

### Summer Anti-Epidemic Campaign Develops; Street Injections Implemented; Eight Injection Sites Set Up in the French Concession

According to the Shanghai Times, Mr. Pilot, Director of the Health Department of the French Concession Municipal Council, disclosed yesterday (8th) that the anti-epidemic injection campaign in the French Concession has made great progress. To date, no fewer than 205,115 residents have been vaccinated.

Issuance of Vaccination Certificates

This year, because the anti-epidemic is being carried out in cooperation with the Japanese authorities, certificates are issued to those who receive the injections. In addition to setting up eight injection centers in the French Concession, the French Health Department has also sent mobile teams to large public and private organizations, schools, restaurants, factories, and apartments to administer vaccinations. Any location that applies for a mobile team to administer vaccinations can do so as long as there are a large number of people to be vaccinated. In order to complete this campaign, the health authorities have hired more doctors and nurses to assist. Police officers assist in street vaccinations to ensure the effectiveness of the work and maintain good order.

Strict Inspections

The anti-epidemic injection campaigns in the two concessions are now progressing smoothly. The Public Concession has scheduled to implement street injections starting tomorrow (11th). Those who do not have a certificate of anti-epidemic injection will find it inconvenient to walk on the street and will be subject to forced injection. In the French Concession, there are eight fixed injection sites, including 630 Rue Belles, 840 Avenue des Soeurs, the intersection of Route Heger and Route Say-Zoong, the iron gate of Nanyang Bridge, and the Laoximen intersection. The French Health Department's report finally reminded the public that, starting from May 5th, anyone entering or leaving the Japanese-occupied areas of South China must present a certificate of cholera and plague vaccination that is no more than six months old.

According to the French Concession Health Department, the anti-epidemic injection sites are 630 Route Belles, 840 Avenue des Soeurs, the small clinic on Route Tenant de la Tour, the St. Paul's Church site in Zikawei, the corner of Route Sagean and Route Heger, the iron gate on Route Tenant de la Tour, and the iron gate on Xinqiao Street in Laoximen. In addition to the original personnel, including five doctors, one veterinarian, eight Chinese and foreign nurses, and six injectors, the Health Department has also hired sixteen additional injectors and has received the enthusiastic assistance of nurses from the French Barracks and twenty clerks to assist in the anti-epidemic work. After the injections are administered, anti-epidemic certificates are issued. This work is being carried out quickly under the careful supervision of foreign personnel. In addition, the assistance from the police is greatly appreciated.

According to the Public Works Department's Information Office, a type of peddler has been discovered on the market who is constantly selling so-called cream to offices and residences.

The Public Works Department's Health Office obtained 29 pounds of this type of cream from these peddlers and subjected it to chemical analysis. The analysis showed that it was rancid, had a foul odor, and was unfit for consumption. The public should be cautious when purchasing it. The public is hereby warned as above.

### Xu Shaojiu Painting Exhibition in Haining

Xu Shaojiu of Haining is the literary grandson of Mr. Dishan, the owner of Xu Garden. Mr. Xu built a villa called Shuangqing Villa on Caobao Road, Tangjia Street, where he hosted elegant gatherings of famous people, splashing ink and applying paint. He was a man of many talents, skilled in painting. Xu Shaojiu inherited his legacy, diligently studying painting. His figures and landscapes have lofty artistic conceptions. His style traces back to the Song and Yuan dynasties, but he is not limited to the academic style. He secretly consulted his own ideas, but he is not involved in contemporary trends. The six principles of painting, especially the so-called "qi yun sheng dong" (spiritual consonance and vitality), are fully expressed in his works. However, he is modest and does not boast. Therefore, his works are rarely circulated, and it is often regrettable that he has not been able to obtain even a single piece of silk. Now, at the urging of his friends, he has produced his exquisite works for display at the Daxin Gallery, starting on the 11th of this month, for connoisseurs to appreciate.

### Selling Inaccurate Weights and Measures; Revolve Resale

A German-owned pastry shop at 155 Jing An Temple Road was fined 50 yuan for using inaccurate weights and measures.

A lawsuit was filed against Zheng Fangji, the manager of the Scientific Instrument Museum. Zheng claimed that the weights and measures were not produced by them but were purchased from Yaohua Factory at No. 1, Lane 244, Dagu Road, and there was an invoice to prove it. This case will now order the person in charge of the Yaohua Factory to be summoned to court for questioning. Zheng Fangji was released on bail of 5,000 yuan.

### Double Horse Yarn Factory Orders Still Plummeting, Another Rumor Claims Prices Will Rebound

In the cotton yarn market, spot prices continue to rise, but due to rumors of unreliable deliveries of Shuangma factory orders, market sentiment suddenly turned bearish, and market prices plummeted. (However, some say that Shuangma Yarn Factory's orders can still be delivered as usual; ten bales of yarn were seen being delivered on the evening of the 7th.) 42-count Blue Phoenix is priced at 13,650 yuan to 14,300 yuan, 60-count Five Sons at 23,000 yuan, 32-count Fairy Peach at 12,500 yuan, 32-count Flying Tiger at 9,500 yuan, 32-count Celestial Maiden at 10,450 yuan, 32-count Fairy Peach at 11,000 yuan, 20-count New Earth at 6,500 yuan to 6,600 yuan, 20-count Moon Harp at 6,300 yuan to 6,500 yuan, 20-count Shuangma at 6,450 yuan to 6,600 yuan, 20-count Blue Phoenix at 7,550 yuan to 7,660 yuan, 20-count Hongxi at 7,200 yuan, 18-count Weaver Girl at 6,400 yuan, 10-count Red Shuangma at 4,800 yuan to 5,050 yuan, 10-count Boy Scout at 4,800 yuan to 4,900 yuan, 16-count Red Kui Xing at 6,750 yuan to 6,800 yuan. The opening price for 20-count Shuangma factory orders was 5,350 yuan. At this time, there were many sellers on the market, and the market price plummeted to 4,860 yuan. Afterwards, there was a slight short-covering rally, closing at 4,960 yuan. However, off-market prices continued to fall by 100 to 200 yuan. Due to the sharp price drop, several companies are rumored to have defaulted.

Another report says that the price of cotton in the interior is rising daily. Based on the cost of raw materials and expenses, the total cost of each bale of 20-count yarn is nearly 7,000 yuan. (If the cotton price is 1,600 yuan per picul, calculated at 355 catties, the cotton cost is 5,680 yuan, plus an additional 1,200 yuan for expenses, totaling 6,880 yuan.) Therefore, the sharp drop and subsequent sharp rise in 20-count Shuangma factory orders is an inevitable trend in the market's price curve. Let's see which saying is correct.

### Discussion on Cloth Sales: No Reason for Optimism, Fugui Factory Orders Suffer a Blow

Factory Cloth: Yesterday, the cloth market remained in a state of fluctuation. In terms of actual sales, there was a lack of positive signs, but based on costs and the tight supply of existing goods, prices had no room to fall. Therefore, the opening price for Peach Blossom Ladies’ Forest Cloth was announced at 348 yuan to 349 yuan, but by the afternoon close, it had risen to 351 yuan, an increase of 1 yuan from the previous day. Although there were few transactions for other coarse and fine cloths, prices remained firm. For example, 16-pound Earth coarse cloth was priced at 260 yuan, Flying Goose at 250 yuan, and 12-pound Dapeng fine cloth at 235 yuan, with current spot prices for superior fine cloth at 218 yuan. However, Fugui factory orders suffered the same fate as Shuangma yarn factory orders, plummeting to 150 yuan, with no one inquiring.

Eastern Cloth: Dragon Head was slightly soft, while Drill remained firm. The morning opening price for new orders of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was a low of 279 yuan. With fewer sellers and more buyers in the market, prices trended upwards, reaching a high of 283 yuan. The afternoon close saw a slight decrease, with the final price at 281.50 yuan, a decrease of 1.50 yuan. Mid-range miscellaneous brand fine cloths were neither up nor down. The opening price for Four Gentlemen Drill red orders was 9.23 yuan, rising to 9.367 yuan, then falling back to 9.32 yuan, an increase of 0.02 yuan.

### Cash Stable

The cash market was sluggish and the off-market initially showed firmness but then weakened, yet the overall trend remained stable. The sudden selling by two cash houses caused some unease. The initial transaction price in the morning was 21,750 yuan, rising by 50 yuan immediately. Securities houses came in to push the price up by 100 yuan, reaching 21,850 yuan, which led to the selling by cash houses and another securities house. Later, the price saw a slight drop to 21,500 yuan. A certain bank bought at 21,600 yuan, and the final transaction price was 21,550 yuan, a decrease of 150 yuan compared to the previous day. The price fluctuated by 350 yuan on the day, with few transactions.

The exchange price for silver and gold jewelry at Daxin and its counterparts remained at 2,250 yuan per tael (with a reduction of 200 yuan for purchases), while refined silver was listed at 18 yuan and black market silver at 16.23 yuan. Silver coins declined to around 9.5 yuan each.

### Foreign Currencies Mostly Hovering

In the foreign exchange market, the British pound and US dollar were relatively stable, with the former remaining at 510 yuan and the latter at 520 yuan. There was demand for US dollar drafts at 32.30 yuan and selling interest at 33.70 yuan. Hong Kong drafts remained at 5.12 yuan. Military notes opened at 7.18 yuan in the morning, then retreated to 7.11 yuan, and finally settled at 7.17 yuan, an increase of 0.04 yuan from the previous day.

The Money Industry Association's call loan rate remained at 0.10 yuan, and the discount rate for interbank drafts was 15 to 18 yuan per thousand yuan, which remained stable. Reserve notes appreciated by 0.312 yuan per yuan.

### Securities Market Flat and Weak

The over-the-counter market for government bonds was very stable yesterday, with very little trading and a generally weak trend. However, there are still many potential changes in the future, which will undoubtedly cause fluctuations similar to those seen recently. Both bulls and bears are still conserving their strength and will not stop here. We can wait and see. Yesterday's trading was mainly for settling transactions and was very peaceful. Those with slightly larger volumes were Runde and Hu Heji on the selling side, and Tongyuan, Dai Yuxing, and Lianhe on the buying side. Xinyi and Zhenhua each bought 50,000 to 70,000 yuan, while Hongda, Yongchang, and Jiufeng had both buying and selling activity. However, there were slightly more purchases than sales, with supplies coming from Tongli, Baolong, Tongshun, Yichang, and Lianyi. As a result, except for Grade A, which was slightly better by 0.10 yuan, the rest were down by 0.10 to 0.20 yuan, with Grade B down by 0.50 yuan. The transaction volume was only 300,000 to 400,000 yuan. A simplified table is listed below: Category Highest Lowest Closing Compared to Previous Day Unified A 66.80 66.60 66.80 Up 0.10 Unified B 60.20 60.00 60.10 Down 0.50 Unified C 60.30 59.50 59.50 Down 0.20 Unified D 55.50 54.80 54.90 Down 0.10 Unified E 57.30 56.40 56.90 Down 0.10

Yesterday, spot prices of foreign shares rose and fell unevenly, but the trend was relatively stable. A total of 9,800 shares of Chinese-registered stocks were traded during the half-day session, including 3,500 shares of Yeguang, which retreated from 26.5 yuan to 26 yuan. 2,500 shares of Zhongfang retreated from 21 yuan to 20.025 yuan. 2,000 shares of Zhongying retreated from 15.6 yuan to 15 yuan. 400 shares of Jardine Spinning rose from 37 yuan to 38 yuan. 200 shares of Kaiping were traded at 57.5 yuan and 57 yuan. 200 shares of Xiangtai Timber were traded at 36 yuan. 500 shares of Paper Industry were traded at 11.8 yuan. 500 shares of Xinhe were traded at 15.6 yuan. The rest were not traded.

Furthermore, according to a letter from the Chinese members of the Public Industry Association, the 700 shares of Yeguang (foreign name) reported in yesterday's foreign stock news were, upon investigation, a factual error and should have been 700 shares of Gangye Chinese registered stocks. The association hereby makes a correction.

Yesterday, the decline in Chinese stocks attracted buying interest, stabilizing the market and increasing trading activity slightly. Wing On Co. was priced at 61.5 yuan, Sincere at 75 yuan, Lane Crawford at 26.5 yuan, China Underwear between 24 yuan and 23.75 yuan, Hongxing Hosiery had buying interest at 197.5 yuan, Dafeng Dyeing & Weaving at 470 yuan, Star Perfumery at 225 yuan, New Asia Pharmaceutical (new) at 33.7 yuan, Sino-French (new) at 58.9 yuan, Five Continents at 215 yuan, China Bookstore rose from 115 yuan to 117.5 yuan, World (new) at 71.5 yuan, rumors of Beishui Electricity at 17.75 yuan, Huashang Leixun at 18 yuan, China Union Bank had buying interest at 85 yuan, Nanyang Brothers Tobacco at 54.5 yuan, and Great China Match had selling offers at 152 yuan.

### Grains Remain Firm and Expensive

The movement of edible oil in this city is difficult and is gradually being resolved. Supply is still smooth. According to recent statistics from the Edible Oil Trade Association, the daily distribution volume is between 1,500 and 2,000 dan. As a result, the black market has virtually disappeared. As for the fixed prices, raw oil is still priced at 1.075 yuan per catty in military currency, soybean oil at 1.025 yuan, and rapeseed oil and clear oil at 0.975 yuan.

The bean market slightly turned upward yesterday, due to rumors that the allocation of goods had not been fully implemented, causing market sentiment to gradually return to firmness. Red beans and silkworm red beans both rose by 3 to 5 yuan. Off-market prices for soybeans also tightened. A total of 140 packages of Chongming silkworm beans were offered at prices between 130 and 138 yuan, 100 packages of sand red beans were offered at a price of 235 yuan, 50 packages of Tianjin red beans were offered at a price of 225 yuan for self-delivery, and 50 packages of Pinghu red beans were offered at a price of 232.5 yuan for self-delivery. Due to the lack of arrivals, red sorghum turned upwards by 2 or 3 yuan as sellers raised prices. A total of 140 packages of Taizhou red sorghum were traded at a price of 165 yuan.

Family Parents' Day Special Edition

### Commemorating Parents' Day

— Yi

Today is the second annual Parents' Day in China. Children with parents and those who are parents themselves cannot help but have various thoughts on this special occasion. Roughly speaking, at least half of the world's population is made up of men, women, and children. Therefore, on this annual holiday, children should respect their parents, and parents should take on their responsibilities as parents. Thus, Parents' Day can truly be said to be a holiday for all of humanity. Without parents, we would not exist or grow up. If we do not have children and raise them well, the nation cannot reproduce or become healthy.

Promoting the Virtue of Filial Piety

Starting with promoting the virtue of filial piety, our bodies and minds are all received from our parents. Our parents give us life and nurture us. Every change of season inevitably requires our parents to worry about us. There is no need to recount the daily care and love they provide, such as three meals a day. Therefore, Chinese people have always advocated filial piety. At the same time, Chinese history is full of famous mothers who taught their children to achieve fame, and Mencius's mother's choice of neighbors three times aligns with modern scientific principles of parenting. Mother Ou's teaching through writing in the ashes demonstrates a spirit of perseverance. Mother Yue's tattooing on her son's back proclaims loyalty and righteousness. These all occupy a glorious page in history and serve as examples for future parents. In addition, there are many valuable family letters that can prove the value of paternal teaching. Among modern figures, it is not difficult to cite several examples. Mr. Hu Shi, in his book "Forty Self-Narrative," mentioned how much he benefited from his mother's teaching. Mr. Zhao Jinqing had his calligraphic work on "Qiaosong Maoyin Cizhu Chunhui" printed to commemorate his parents. Mr. Xu Beihong had a painting depicting his mother educating her children. These are all things we have seen. In addition, there are many parents, especially mothers, who spare no effort and even use the meager money they earn from their hard work to plan for their children's education expenses. This is a truly great and praiseworthy thing. Therefore, on this Parents' Day, we should reflect on the gifts our parents have given us and find ways to repay them.

Promoting Parental Education

However, fulfilling our filial duty to the previous generation of parents is only half of our responsibility. If we have already become parents ourselves, then we should cultivate ourselves and do our best to educate our children. Because the birth of children is something that every couple without serious illness can achieve, we must be able to both give birth and raise them well, and educate them, in order to fulfill our responsibilities as parents. Washington's father was able to encourage honesty (if another father had heard Washington's honest story, he might have severely scolded him), Roosevelt's mother worked hard to raise her son, hoping that he would become an upright citizen, Edison's mother was able to understand everything about her son, and finally created a great inventor, and Shaw's mother was a musical genius, and her love of music had a great influence on Shaw.

Indeed, family education is more important than school education. We must not think that we have fulfilled our responsibilities as parents simply by sending our children to school. We must strive to cultivate our children in the home, to develop their beautiful character, good habits, and noble personality.

Relieving Distressed Parents

In addition, on this Parents' Day, there is also meaningful work to be done, which is to improve the welfare of parents. In addition to respecting our own parents, we should also respect the parents of others. When we encounter distressed parents, we should find ways to help them. This is both treating others' parents as we would our own and a manifestation of the spirit of human mutual assistance.

Parents' Day can pass quickly, but if we can work hard according to the three points mentioned above, then there will be more wise parents, more promising children, healthier families, and a more progressive society in the future.

### My Mother (First Revelation of Short Writings)

— Yu

The mother described here can be said to be a fighter who emerged from the shackles of old etiquette. She was able to bravely send her daughter to school. This spirit is indeed worthy of our admiration. — Editor

Grandmother had not wanted Mom to comb her hair for several days, and she would not respond when Mom called her. The reason was that Mom had not followed her wishes and had allowed me to study at the county middle school as a boarding student. So, whenever she saw guests who came to visit, she would sigh and say, "When a person gets old, they are like yellowed pearls, worthless. I'm old, and my words are outdated. 'Lack of talent in a woman is a virtue.' This is an ancient saying passed down through the generations. Girls of twelve or thirteen years old should be learning needlework at home, instead of being sent to a strange school to study. It's truly a misfortune for our family."

Because of this matter, Dad also blamed Mom a bit, often saying, "You spoil the child too much."

Grandmother's sarcasm and Dad's blame, but what could Mom do? Besides shedding tears in secret, she had no better way to vent. She often said to me when no one else was around, "Yu, you must strive to succeed, so that Mom won't be ridiculed by others in the future." I could only nod and shed crystal tears.

Time flew by quickly, and in the blink of an eye, it was time for school to start. The day before I left, Mom was packing my luggage. Her small feet, which made walking difficult, were moving back and forth without stopping. A light blue linen shirt was half-soaked with sweat. I asked her to rest for a while several times and let me do it myself. She just said, "It's hot, let me do it. You won't do it properly." She was busy until evening before she finished packing.

In the evening, Dad called me over and gave me fifty yuan, saying that it included food, tuition, and books. I accepted it with trembling hands. I couldn't complain about the small amount, nor could I allow myself to complain. This amount was still what Mom had spent great effort to argue for me.

The next day, as soon as dawn broke, Mom quietly woke me up and handed me twenty hot silver dollars, saying that they were her savings over time, for me to use as pocket money. I took the money, and tears soaked my eyes again. What I was holding was not just money, but Mom's burning heart!

After several twists and turns, thanks to Mom's help and my own determined struggle, I finally succeeded in becoming an elementary school teacher, which is despised by today's society. I have never been able to make Mom proud. When I returned home last winter, my luggage was still simple and my hands were empty. Although Mom still loved me the same, seeing Mom's teeth falling out, her hair turning gray, and gradually entering old age, my heart could not help but ache. How can I repay Mom for her past expectations of me!

### Tears of a Loving Mother

The British physicist and chemist Faraday (1791-1867) started out as a laborer and worked hard to study, eventually being hailed as a leading figure in the world of physics. He once said:

"The tears of a loving mother, when analyzed chemically, are nothing more than a small amount of water and salt. But it must be known that in those tears flowing down her cheeks, there exists a noble and profound love that chemistry cannot analyze."

Two Songs of Love for Parents

### (1) Good Parents

— Jia Jinhua

Hands cradle the child's bed, turning the universe, teaching and nurturing with all their heart. Parents fulfill their duty. Children achieve success. All depends on parents. Talent, virtue, and grace. Father is important. Mother is important. Father and mother are equally important. With good parents, there are good people. Therefore, parents are important.

(2) If It Weren't for a Loving Mother
— Lan Fen

If it weren't for a loving mother, where would childhood joys be found? If it weren't for a loving mother, how could I have grown to this day? She spends all her strength, she spends all her heart, that love is truly endless! The child grows up, the mother ages, how shall I comfort her heart?

This publication will print 10,000 copies of Mr. Gao Tianqi's song "Mother" with music and lyrics, as well as the above two songs with simplified notation, for readers to request. Please send your letters to the editorial department of this publication, and they will be sent immediately, free of charge, but only while supplies last of 10,000 copies.

Love your parents with the same heart you love your wife, and your parents will be happy. Protect the nation with the same heart you protect your official position, and the nation will be governed well.

Nothing is greater than loyalty and filial piety. Loyalty is a treasure to a nation. Filial piety is a treasure to a family.

Don't be afraid of hard work when being filial. In the blink of an eye, you will be a parent yourself.

Filial piety, brotherly love, loyalty, trustworthiness, propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame are the eight pillars that hold up the sky.

### Mother

### Don't Forget Our Millionaires

— Hua

The millionaires mentioned here are not millionaires with millions in assets, but our children! Because our children have millions of minutes available to them, and since time is the most priceless treasure in the world, then they are the luckiest and richest people in the world to have these millions of minutes. Take a ten-year-old child, for example. If they can live to seventy years old, they will have thirty million minutes. One-third of that time is spent sleeping, one-third is spent busy with life, and they still have one-third of their time left to cultivate themselves.

Regarding the value of maternal education, the book "Theory of Character," translated by Qin Tongpei, contains the following passage:

One good mother is worth a hundred school teachers. A good mother in the home is like a magnet in the heart, a North Star in the eye, towards which all children turn and gather, their minds all drawn to her.

Cooley once compared the influence of early childhood concepts to words carved on the bark of a young tree. The words on the bark grow with the tree, and so do the impressions of early childhood. When the impressions are first made, they are very small, but they gradually grow, and even in adulthood, they are difficult to erase.

Therefore, let us not forget the millionaires in our homes, and give them a good education in their youth, so that they can enjoy their valuable wealth when they become adults.

### My Mother (Second Revelation of Short Writings)

— Xiaojun

Motherly love is the most greatest. From this text, we can see a lovely, kind mother — Editor

When I was six years old, I started reading, reciting the dry and boring "Three Character Classic." Being dull-witted, I would often cry in frustration and not be able to recite it. Seeing that my older sister and brother could both recite it well, I felt very ashamed. So, my mother would gently comfort me, and then have my older sister teach me to read. I would follow along and respond. After just a few repetitions, I could recite it like an old woman chanting scriptures. In my childish mind at the time, I was left with the impression that my mother was the person who helped me overcome difficulties, and I felt my mother was very lovable.

Unfortunately, in the year I turned ten, my older sister and brother passed away one after another. At that time, I was also suffering from a dangerous case of typhoid fever. My mother, having suffered a severe blow and weighed down by great worries, stayed by my bedside day and night, often going five or six days without sleep. Whenever I cried out in my sleep, she would immediately say, "Child, how do you feel?" One night, my mother called out to me, "Child! Take your medicine!" At that time, I felt that my mother had not slept for several days, so I said, "Mom! You should sleep for a while too!" Mom said, "I already slept and just got up." I turned my head and saw that Mom's bedding was neatly arranged, so I knew she hadn't slept. From then on, I understood that my mother was the person who cared most about my health.

In the spring of my thirteenth year, I was admitted to the first year of junior high school (this was the first time I had ever attended school). My mother told me what attitude I should have towards teachers and classmates. Because I had never attended school before, I didn't know what an exam was. At the end of the semester, I failed three subjects and needed to take a make-up exam to be promoted. I cried. And my mother? Instead, she comforted me and said, "Child! It's okay. It's because you don't know the rules of the school."

Once, my mother said to me, "Child! You are my only son, and you should make me proud. Don't let people say that I spoil you!" When I heard this, I thought that my mother wanted me to study usefully, so I held my books and read myself to death. I don't know how, but that year I developed asthma, which would flare up and then subside, and has not been cured to this day. My mother was worried day and night about it. As a result, her own health deteriorated day by day, and her hair gradually turned white. Whenever my asthma flared up, she would always stay up all night. Although my mother was very frugal with all expenses, she did not care about the large expenses for medical treatment.

Our school's regulations state that the student who graduates at the top of the third year of high school can receive a scholarship to go to university. At that time, I also had hopes of getting the scholarship. But unfortunately, I ended up getting second place. When I presented my graduation certificate and award certificate to my mother, my mother said, "Child! Did you not have any dubious actions (referring to cheating)!" I said with a straight face, "Mom! I would never disgrace you for the sake of vanity." At this time, I saw Mom smile genuinely for the first time. She also said, "A shameful first place is not as good as a glorious last place." Later, she further instructed me to go to that university. From then on, I knew that Mom not only cared about my health, but also cared about my personality even more.

A mother's love is noble and indescribable.
