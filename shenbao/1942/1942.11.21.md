### A Major Battle Imminent in Tunisia: Both Sides Actively Prepare, Seizing the Element of Time; Allied Forces Advance Eastward in a Fan Formation

Lisbon Allied News Agency, 20th—Berlin has acknowledged that while there have been no large-scale battles in Tunisia, German and Allied forces have made contact along the coast. German forward units have engaged General Anderson's First Army, and both sides' air forces are highly active. The Axis forces are advancing into various regions of Tunisia according to plan. The Axis air force has heavily bombed Bône, a city 50 miles from the Tunisian-Algerian border, as well as Allied transport ships along the coast. It is rumored that the Axis forces possess substantial strength in the Tunisian capital and the naval base of Bizerte, the two major targets of the Allied offensive. This location is only 75 miles from Sicily, Italy. General Anderson's British First Army, assisted by American mechanized units, is advancing towards Bizerte in three or four columns. It is rumored that American paratroopers have occupied several airfields in Tunisia, and American Flying Fortresses attacked Bizerte yesterday.

Stockholm, 19th, Havas Agency—According to neutral military observers here, a major battle is about to occur in Tunisia, the importance of which surpasses the Libyan front. It is rumored that General Rommel has arrived in Tunisia. The objectives of both sides are very clear. The Axis forces are trying to establish a defense line as far west as possible to protect the ports of Bizerte and Tunis, avoiding fighting with their backs to the sea. This is crucial. On the British and American side, the aim is to cut off the Axis forces in Tunisia and isolate them. One unit of the Anglo-American forces is advancing southeast from Bône, directly approaching Tunis and Sousse. Another unit has arrived at a certain location on the Algerian-Tunisian border, and to the south, another Anglo-American unit is advancing towards Gafsa and Tripoli. It is expected that the future battle will be very intense. The Axis forces' plan is to defeat the Anglo-American forces before they can deploy their defenses. Therefore, "speed" is a prerequisite for this battle. For the United States, time is also a major factor. As the American troops are not yet familiar with combat, it is advantageous to preemptively strike before Germany deploys heavy armored units.

Berlin, 19th, Havas Agency—The German News Agency recently issued a message stating, "After studying the situation in North Africa and Europe, it is believed that new military actions are being prepared, the scope of which will be even greater than the Allied landings in North Africa. For example, regarding the Axis forces' arrival in North Africa, German and Italian military personnel are silent. However, anyone who has contacted German and Italian military leaders is aware that the authorities are preparing for a large-scale war. This action will be launched in a place that the enemy can hardly anticipate, which is one point. Also, German and Italian military personnel are tight-lipped about the Axis forces' movements in North Africa. Berlin only says that the Axis forces' actions are still in the initial stage, and the progress cannot be announced at this time. German authorities even refuse to say whether the Axis forces' occupation of Tunis and Bizerte can be considered a 'fait accompli,' which is another point. In the future, the Axis forces' operations in North Africa will not be limited to Tunisia. The Libyan defense area under General Rommel is also very active. The reason why the British Eighth Army does not dare to advance rashly is that it does not know where the Axis forces' positions are, which is a third point. In short, the silence of the German military authorities is only the calm before the storm. They are already confident of success."

First Encounter Between German and British Tank Units

Vichy, 20th, Allied News Agency—According to news received here this morning, small skirmishes have occurred in the Tunisian war at Tabarka, 65 miles from the Bizerte naval port. At the same time, Moroccan radio reported this morning that 30 German tanks had their first encounter with British tanks in Tunisia.

Axis Forces in Libya Retreat from Benghazi

Tangier, 20th, Haitian News Agency—Neutral observers here believe that the Allied operations in Algeria and Tunisia are gradually slowing down. A British spokesman explained the reason for the slowdown, saying that it was due to adopting a new strategy of establishing a fan-shaped defense to control the entire area.

Berlin, 20th, Allied News Agency—According to an official announcement today, the Axis forces in Cyrenaica withdrew from Benghazi according to plan. Various military facilities and roads leading to the city were destroyed before the retreat.

Berlin, 20th, Haitian News Agency—General Rommel's troops in Cyrenaica continue to avoid encirclement by the enemy. The British attempt to cut off the Axis forces in the Benghazi area from the south has failed.

### Ambassador Shigemitsu Meets with Prime Minister Tojo After Returning to Japan: Views on the China Issue Are Consistent

Tokyo, 20th, Central News Agency—Since Ambassador Shigemitsu returned to Japan from China on the 6th, he has been very busy with various consultations. After several meetings with Prime Minister and Army Minister Tojo, Navy Minister Shimada, Greater East Asia Minister Aoki, Vice Minister Yamanaka, and Mr. Hirachi, opinions between the central government and the local authorities seem to be completely consistent. According to observers here, the main points are roughly as follows: (1) The completion of the Greater East Asia War is not only related to Japan's survival but also to China's existence. The National Government has fully recognized this point and will work together to unite the Chinese and Japanese nations and strive to promote the total war system. (2) The policy towards China will remain unchanged and will be actively promoted in the future. (3) Comprehensive measures will be taken regarding Japan's mobilization of resources and expansion of production. The enhancement of the National Government's political and economic power will be the premise for its promotion, and Japan will actively cooperate with the National Government. (4) To meet the needs of the wartime objective situation, a "local first" principle will be adopted. As for the implementation, since the establishment of the Greater East Asia Ministry, foreign administration has been unified, and the authority of the ambassador to China will naturally expand accordingly. It is believed that Ambassador Shigemitsu has obtained considerable and extensive authority as a result of his meetings with various parties. Ambassador Shigemitsu will return to his post within days after completing his mission. It is expected that after returning to Nanjing, he will first hold discussions with various envoys and other related parties in China to determine specific implementation methods.

Lisbon, 20th, Allied News Agency—According to a Reuters report from Rome Radio last night, General Weygand, former Governor-General of French North Africa, has been arrested by the Germans in France and has been sent to Germany.

Vichy, 19th, Havas Agency—Marshal Pétain delivered a radio address to the nation today, urging the people to maintain discipline and unite during this period of severe national crisis. He said, "Fellow citizens, some generals are willing to be used by foreign powers and refuse to obey my orders. All soldiers in North Africa should not accept their false orders. I have previously ordered resistance against the Anglo-American aggression, and I reiterate that order. I hope everyone will comply. We are now trying to get through a critical period. Some of us must be in a state of turmoil. However, the messages broadcasted on the radio are solely intended to divide us and weaken our unity. We must know that our duty is very simple. You must maintain discipline. The motherland is now in danger. I ask every Frenchman to only think about saving the motherland. Any decision I take now is based on the interests of France. Do not forget that there is only one government. I have given full power to the government to rule the country. More than forget, there is only one motherland, that is the French motherland."

### Japanese Army Transport Ship Repels Submarine

Tokyo, 20th, Allied News Agency—A Japanese army transport ship, carrying American prisoners from the Manila internment camp, departed from Manila a month ago. While sailing in the Lingayen Gulf, it suddenly spotted an enemy submarine chasing after it and launching torpedoes at the ship. The ship's crew used extremely skillful techniques to avoid the torpedoes at the last moment, escaping disaster. The ship then changed to a serpentine course and continued forward. However, the enemy submarine continued to fire torpedoes. The ship's captain and all the crew members were greatly inspired and immediately turned the ship directly towards the enemy submarine. Unexpectedly, the enemy submarine, seeing the situation was not good, hastily fled. The escort commander, seeing the urgency of the situation, ordered all the prisoners to assemble on the deck, put on life jackets, and prepare for evacuation. Upon learning that they had escaped danger, all the prisoners were overjoyed and praised the Japanese crew's calm response. Major Jones (formerly serving at Cavite Naval Station) and two others, out of gratitude, told Commander Danjo that after hearing the Japanese crew shout loudly, they saw torpedoes coming through the waves. They were ordered to put on life jackets and wait for escape. At that time, they knew there was little hope of survival and were very afraid. They were impressed that the Japanese crew dodged three torpedoes in an instant and made the attacking submarine flee in a hurry. Their calmness and skillful techniques were truly admirable.

### Extreme Cold Weather on the Eastern Front Affects Military Operations; Only Assault Teams Active in Stalingrad; Soviet Offensive on Leningrad Repulsed

Berlin, 20th, Haitian News Agency—The extreme cold and heavy snow on the Eastern Front have affected military operations. The entire Eastern Front was very quiet on Wednesday. On that day, surrounded Soviet troops in the Dupes area were annihilated. 450 Soviet soldiers were killed, 200 were captured, and a large amount of military supplies was lost. An enemy counterattack in Alagi was repulsed. Only assault teams were active in Stalingrad. On the Don River front, the Wehrmacht prevented the enemy from advancing, and fierce fighting is ongoing. German police in the central region were engaged in mopping-up operations in the rear, killing 138 guerrillas and capturing four. In the Elbrus region of the Caucasus, German mountain assault troops continued to engage the enemy in the severe cold. The two armies also made contact in the Bazingensen region. All Soviet attacks were repulsed.

Berlin, 20th, Haitian News Agency—Military authorities here stated yesterday that the Soviet army in Leningrad launched a localized rescue offensive, but after four days of hard fighting, they retreated without success.

Rome, 19th, Havas Agency—A reporter from Il Giornale d'Italia on the Eastern Front reported that the rivers within the Soviet Union have begun to freeze, which will have a significant impact on the war situation. The Soviet rivers have been natural barriers between the Red Army and the Axis forces. Once the rivers are completely frozen and hardened, heavy tanks can drive on them. It is expected that the fighting will resume for several weeks before the severe cold arrives. The current situation in various regions is as follows: (1) In the Volkhov area, the Red Army has begun to use the frozen river to attack the German army, but after three days of fierce fighting in the ice and snow, they have been repulsed. (2) The German army is attacking southeast of Lake Ilmen to improve their positions. The German army is now in a favorable position. (3) In the Stalingrad area, the Red Army's attempt to recapture the ruins has been unsuccessful. The Volga River is now covered with thin ice, and the temporary bridges on the river have been destroyed by floating ice. The garrison in Stalingrad can no longer receive supplies from the river. However, once the ice layer is strong, the Red Army will attempt to transport supplies across the ice to reinforce the garrison in the city. At that time, the war situation will change. (4) In the Kalmyk region, the German army is conducting a large-scale mopping-up operation against the guerrillas. Most of the enemy soldiers fight to the last drop of blood, so no soldiers have been captured.

### John Amery Broadcasts in Germany

Berlin, 20th, Haitian News Agency—John, the son of British Secretary of State for India Amery, delivered a moving speech on a German radio station yesterday, saying that the current war is a crime against culture. Listeners may be surprised why I, as a Briton, am speaking on a German radio station tonight. I had hoped that the Churchill government would be rational and consider our precious culture, but to my surprise, it turned out differently. I have lived in neutral countries for almost two years, so I have been able to obtain the truth of general facts from the propaganda messages. This is my motivation for being here tonight. Today, not only has the empire passed down by our ancestors been thrown into the furnace of war, but we have also formed an alliance with the Soviet Union, whose counterpart has long harbored the intention of destroying our empire. From a moral standpoint, this is a major stain on our honor. Communism is about to invade Britain in a big way, destroying everything we hold dear. I hope my compatriots can be rational and see through the propaganda that a few people are engaged in. I do not hope that you will believe me, but I hope that you will judge right and wrong and distinguish the truth with your own eyes. None of the major newspapers in London are not controlled by Jews. You love England deeply, but those who are in a guiding position are those who have no right to call themselves English. Take the Dieppe incident as an example. Jewish politicians such as Josiah Wedgwood and Pierre van Paassen are indifferent to the uncalled-for sacrifice of two or three thousand Christians, but I ask the mothers of these young people to pay attention to this. If your sons died for the motherland, it is a responsibility that citizens should fulfill, but they did not die for the country, but for the international alliance of London, Washington, and Moscow. Are you willing for your sons to die on the beaches of other countries for these reasons? Have you forgotten Finland? The people of this small country bravely resisted Stalin's aggression to protect their national freedom and independence. But today, the priests of England pray to God every Sunday, asking him to help the Bolshevik executioners complete the work of killing people and scattering families. If God knows, he will surely punish these priests who sympathize with beasts. In fact, the facts are very simple. We have been deceived by others, and we have been sold to New York and Moscow. After they have exhausted our resources, they will abandon us. Have our interests in the Americas not been completely handed over to Jewish capitalists in New York? Then shouldn't we do something about it? Know that the final decision is not up to the government or Congress, but up to you. We should move forward bravely and launch our patriotic true feelings to stop others from continuing to sacrifice the lives of our compatriots and exploit the interests of our country. Please ask yourself whether this war is necessary. Who is telling you to go to war? And who is preventing a reasonable understanding with Germany? There is no need for conflict between Britain and Germany. Your leaders say that Germany has the ambition to dominate the world. Don't you know that this is another Jewish trick? Germany has never denied Britain's imperial status. How can it be considered ambitious? Jews have taken your place. Aren't both candidates in the recent London mayoral election Jews? For your sake, it is sincere to make peace with Germany and Italy as soon as possible. The German army is the barrier between communism and culture, and the protector of private property and family. If Germany is defeated, your freedom will become a thing of the past. You will live in the Soviet paradise for a long time, and it will not be easy to escape. Today's situation has reached the point where Britain cannot win and the United States cannot win. If Germany is defeated, Britain's position will be handed over to the United States, and then to the Jews to complete the work of dominating the world. President Roosevelt is not only asking us for a very high price, but what he wants is not paper money, but gold, land, or shares. Is this the behavior of a true friend? Now, for your own benefit, you should expel those who have brought the country to this point, those who have seduced Britain to form an alliance with the United States and the Soviet Union, and stop our compatriots from continuing to be sacrificed so that we can have a day to see the light of day again. Before John Amery delivered his speech, the radio announcer made a brief statement, saying that the German government was not responsible for what Mr. John said, and that this speech was entirely Mr. Amery's initiative, requesting the German government to express its free opinion.

### Salt Rationing Begins Next Month: One Jin Per Person Per Month; Amount Allocated Per Lianbao Based on Population; Registered Stores Must Apply in Advance

The city's salt supply will implement a rationing system starting next month, tentatively set at one jin per person per month. The responsible party is Yu Mao Official Salt Company. All salt shops and sauce and fermentation workshops within the two concessions that sell salt, as well as businesses like sauce-making, cured meat, and restaurant businesses, whether or not they have registered with the company, must have their responsible person bring their citizen ID or baojia (neighborhood security system) number to re-register. The original deadline was today, but due to the extreme congestion of registrants in recent days, the deadline has been extended by two days to the 23rd. Once registration is completed and reviewed by the company, salt purchase certificates will be issued to registered stores for them to collect and sell the salt.

Complete Regulations for Selling Salt

The complete regulations for sauce and fermentation workshops and salt shops in the concession areas to sell salt, as promulgated by Yu Mao Salt Company, are as follows: (1) Sauce and fermentation workshops and salt shops selling salt must first have the responsible person bring their citizen ID or state their baojia number to register with the company. (2) All sauce and fermentation workshops and salt shops approved to sell salt must fill out a voluntary application form and two guarantee forms for submission to the Songjiang Salt Affairs Bureau to obtain a license. (3) The salt ration is tentatively set at one jin per person per month, but during the cured meat season, an additional jin may be purchased. (4) The approved sales quantity cannot be increased or decreased without reason. (5) Salt prices must adhere to the company's set prices and cannot be arbitrarily increased, decreased, or shorted. (6) The sale of smuggled salt is absolutely prohibited. If discovered, the Songjiang Salt Affairs Bureau will be immediately notified to revoke the license and handle the matter according to the law. (7) The company may send personnel at any time to investigate the business conditions of the sellers and inspect relevant account books. (8) If private sellers are found peddling smuggled salt, they should be detained, and the Yuhua Salt Industry Company's Commercial Patrol Section should be notified by telephone. Personnel will be dispatched immediately to arrest them. The reporting person will be rewarded. (The Commercial Patrol Section's office is located in Room 147, upstairs at the HSBC Bank on the Bund, telephone numbers 15124 and 15125.)

Allocation Per Lianbao Based on Population

Sauce and fermentation workshops and salt shops going to register must state their baojia number because the amount of salt allocated in the future will be based on the population of each lianbao. For example, if a lianbao has a population of 10,000, the monthly salt allocation for that lianbao will be 10,000 jin. This 10,000 jin of salt will be allocated to the sauce and fermentation workshops and salt shops within that lianbao. The amount of salt that each seller can obtain will depend on the size of their capital and their usual monthly salt sales. In other words, all registered fermentation workshops and salt shops within the two concessions will have salt to sell, only the quantities will vary slightly. When registering, sauce and fermentation workshops or salt shops must first fill out a salt sales registration form, stating the brand, applicant's name, business address, monthly salt sales, and the guarantor. After the registered sales volume is filled out on this registration form, the applicant will receive the full amount each month. If the salt received is less than the registered sales volume, the guarantor will be responsible for receiving the full amount. Also, after registered salt shops receive their salt purchase certificates, they must purchase the full amount each month. If smuggled salt is mixed in or if the purchase is less than the registered amount, the guarantor will be responsible. The same applies to sauce-making, cured meat, and restaurant businesses registering.

### New Sugar Rationing Measures Already Drafted

The current temporary measures for purchasing sugar with housing donation tickets and citizen IDs will be valid until the end of this month. From December 1st, new measures may be adopted. These new measures have already been drafted and submitted to the relevant authorities for study. Once approved, they will be publicly announced and implemented.

### Neglecting Human Life: Ticket Seller Sentenced

Tram ticket sellers must wait for elderly people or women to step down leisurely when passengers get off the tram before ringing the bell, so as to avoid the danger of falling. At 9:20 AM on October 7th, Jiang Fengsheng, a 50-year-old man from Changzhou (working at the Jiaxing Cinema in Jiaxing Road, with a wife, four daughters, and one son, relying entirely on his salary for livelihood), was getting off the No. 14 trackless trolley at the Beidun Road-Tianjin Road stop when the ticket seller, Lu Guangfu from Zhenjiang, suddenly rang the bell and started the trolley before he had stepped down, causing him to fall and injure his head and waist. He was taken to Shanghai Sanatorium and Hospital by people and trolleys for treatment and died at 7:00 AM on the 2nd of this month. After the incident, Chinese Detective Shi Huanting from the Huijing Concession Police Department arrested the ticket seller, Lu Guangfu, and handed him over to the court. The police representative lawyer prosecuted him for negligent homicide, demanding severe punishment to respect passenger lives. After hearing the arguments, the court sentenced Lu Guangfu to two years and six months in prison as a warning yesterday morning.

At the intersection of Hege Road and Lawrie Road on the afternoon of the 20th of this month, a person riding a bicycle was chased by a crowd shouting "Thief!" The on-duty police officer at the scene ordered him to stop, but he did not listen, so the officer fired a shot at him, hitting him in the leg and arresting him. He was sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment. The thief's name is Shen Gelifu. He stole a bicycle on Hege Road and fled. It was found that he had been sentenced to three months in prison for theft in December 1939.

### Picking Up Gold: Yan Yuanqing Fined

Yan Yuanqing from Yangzhou picked up a gold bar weighing nine taels on the roadside at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Hector Road at about 11:00 AM on May 1st of this year and took it home. He had his nephew Wu Yuebo exchange it for more than 10,000 yuan at Laoyuantai Silver Shop at No. 1888 Jing'an Temple Road and at the home of his friend Zhang Yugao in several installments. He took out 5,000 yuan and bought nine rickshaws, and then opened a rickshaw company at No. 13 Tianjiabang, Yuyuan Road, to make a living. Unexpectedly, Zhang Duanshbin, a resident of No. 3, Lane 125, Jiaozhou Road, who had secretly hidden 42 taels of gold jewelry in a dung-dragging handle, had recently been stolen from him. She reported it to the Jing'an Temple Police Station. Detective Ni Jiafeng and others learned that Yan Wu had picked up a gold bar, so they arrested him. However, after a detailed investigation, it was found that the gold bar picked up by Yan was not the one stolen from the woman, and the timing was also different, so Yan Wu was prosecuted for embezzling lost property. After interrogation yesterday, Yan Yuanqing was sentenced for embezzling lost property, fined 300 yuan, and Wu Yuebo was fined 200 yuan. If they are unable to pay the fine, it will be commuted to one day of labor service for every two yuan. The nine rickshaws were confiscated.

Defenders Li Ning and Zhuang Youren are an old and reliable duo. Midfielder Han Long is versatile. The forward line, Ah Dai and Youliang, is a perfect match. Yuan Kun, on the left wing, is unable to play due to injury. The most exciting thing is Xu Wenkui's appointment as the right inside forward, like adding wings to a tiger. St. Francis has suffered a blow due to the dismissal of national football players Hanibo, Jemwater, and Jia Huate. Fortunately, Karolyek, Sch尔佛, and Dongshan have returned and their strength remains undiminished. The two teams had three trial matches at the beginning of the season, which were difficult to distinguish. This is the fourth time they have met, and the lineups of both sides have changed.

Commercial News

### Public Bonds Suddenly Plunge

Yesterday, the price of public bonds on the unofficial market suddenly dropped sharply due to reported news and rumors of government control. The type C bonds, which had previously broken through the 60 yuan mark, fell back below it. This back-and-forth movement was like a sudden shift from the height of summer to deep autumn. The price decline was swift and substantial, with a uniform drop of three and a half to four yuan, except for type A bonds, which only fell by two yuan and eight jiao. The significant ups and downs in the market were entirely dictated by the environment. Different people have different opinions, and each perspective has its reasons. However, at present, the bears seem to have the upper hand. The recent pattern of sharp declines following two consecutive days of limit-up suggests the underlying weakness of market sentiment. Such wild fluctuations are caused by those who create and then spread fear. As a result, prices fell between two yuan and eight jiao to four yuan, with a total transaction volume of approximately three million yuan. A detailed breakdown is provided below.

### Fluctuations in Chinese Stocks End with Short Squeeze

Yesterday's Chinese stock market saw prices initially decline, then suddenly rebound at noon, ultimately resulting in a short squeeze. This was due to investor uncertainty, with sellers eager to cash out and opportunistic investors buying on the dip. Great China Match shares were in higher demand than supply, rising by two yuan. Culture and World shares rebounded by two yuan. Commercial Press and China shares each fell by five yuan. Yongxiang shares were offered at 27.5 yuan. Xinya and Sino-French shares remained flat, fluctuating by one or two yuan. Zhabei Water & Electricity, which had risen for four consecutive days, suddenly fell back by seven jiao and a half to within 50 yuan. China General Edison fell by one yuan to 35 yuan. In the department store sector, Wing On, Sincere, and National Goods shares each fell by around three yuan. In textiles, Wing On Textile fell by twenty yuan. Small-denomination shares of Great China, Hongsheng, Great Light Weaving, Shanghai Cotton Weaving, and Fuchang Dyeing & Weaving all experienced declines ranging from two jiao and a half to half a yuan. The Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company was the most stable, with infrequent trading. A detailed list is provided below.

### New Woolen Fabric Company Stocks

Four more companies will soon be listed and traded.

Following the listing of insurance companies and enterprise trading companies, many manufacturers are now busy reorganizing into joint-stock companies. This is because there is abundant idle capital in Shanghai, and many investors are now investing in stocks. The woolen fabric industry has seen strong market performance in recent years, leading to particularly active trading. In addition to the already circulating stocks of Dahua, Meilun, and Dagguangming, the new stocks of Yousheng, Tiangong, Meifeng, and Yinfeng will soon be listed. All stocks have a face value of ten yuan. It is predicted that trading will be highly competitive upon listing, and with limited shares available, prices may rise. These are all old factories that have increased capital and reorganized, with brisk sales of their products.

### Decorative Gold Exchange Rate Stabilizes

Yesterday, the gold shops in this city, with Da Xin and his colleagues, set the price for decorative gold at 2,750 yuan per tael (deducting approximately 300 yuan for purchases). Inter-dealer trading was conducted at around 2,535 yuan, the same as the closing price of the previous day, without any formal market or transactions. The quoted price for jewelry silver remained at fourteen yuan per tael, with inter-dealer trading prices remaining between thirteen yuan and thirteen yuan and four jiao, with no changes. Yesterday, the interest rate for interbank lending at the Money Guild remained unchanged at 1.4 jiao.

The foreign exchange market was stable yesterday. The exchange rate for Japanese military scrip was stable, with inter-dealer trading at 5.5546 yuan. Banks and small money shops sold it at 5.56 yuan and bought it at 5 fen, with little change.

### Sparse Transactions in Coarse Grains

Yesterday's coarse grain trading was slightly more active. Transactions included 100 bags of Chongming new corn at 336 yuan, 100 bags of old corn at 216 yuan, 20 bags of Pudong old soybeans at 253 yuan, 10 bags of Nanjing old cowpeas at 250 yuan, more than 10 bags of Chongming old sand silkworms at 200 yuan, and 200 loads of Anqing small bean cakes at 122 yuan per standard load.

### High-Quality Persimmon Cakes to Arrive

It is reported that customers have already arranged for the production of Geng cakes and Pai cakes from the northern regions in significant quantities and will be shipped soon. It is noted that the production cost has increased by 50 to 60 yuan. This item is in high demand in this city, and a higher opening price is expected upon arrival.

### Assorted Lychees Weaken Again

Recently, sales of assorted dried lychees have been slow, and outsiders are releasing their holdings, resulting in a soft market. Yesterday, market prices fell by another 20 to 30 yuan. It is said that goods purchased at previously high prices will likely incur losses.

### Fennel Prices Decline Again

Since the price of fennel softened, sales from various sources have not increased. As a result, the downward trend is difficult to reverse. Yesterday, the market price was 4,920 yuan, with few buyers, indicating little hope for improvement.

Arts and Entertainment

### Stage Drama Inferior to Horses: In Defense of Shi Hui

— Shi Ren

Anyone who has seen the grand circus at the Carlton cannot help but develop a good impression of Shi Hui. If I were to bestow upon him the title of "genius artist," I dare say he would accept it without shame. In the past, I have seen him in roles such as Commissioner Liang in "Metamorphosis" and Old Wang in "Hero of a Deserted Island," and the impression he left on me was more profound than that of any other actor. His special quality lies not only in fully realizing the personality of a character but also in completely concealing himself, to the point where not a trace of him can be seen. Moreover, each time he plays a role, not only does his appearance and manner change, but even his tone and voice become unrecognizable. An artist who can cultivate his art to this ideal state cannot rely solely on hard work without talent. If one were to search the current Chinese theater scene for someone as skilled in acting as Shi Hui, it would not be an easy task. To put it bluntly, there is simply no one. My words may seem somewhat assertive, but I am absolutely certain that countless people will share my feelings and resonate with me.

Given Shi Hui's remarkable acting skills, we would naturally assume that his treatment by the troupe owner would be exceptionally generous. However, it is hard to believe that he only receives a monthly salary of 800 yuan. Compared to the 7,000 yuan a day commanded by some Beijing opera actors, this is an immeasurable difference. Even compared to the small pony that performs on the same stage, it is still a vast difference. The four horses receive a reward of 45 yuan per day for standing on stage for a short time, amounting to a monthly salary of 1,350 yuan. Shi Hui has to perform on stage for six hours every day, and after each performance, he has to memorize scripts late into the night in a state of extreme exhaustion and rehearse new plays early in the morning without a moment's rest, yet the remuneration he receives is not even enough to cover his living expenses, and he has to struggle under high pressure every day! Knowing this, how can we not cry out in defense of Shi Hui and exclaim, "Humans are inferior to horses!"

If an actor with such unique skills as Shi Hui is treated so poorly, it is easy to imagine the plight of others. We are not just speaking out for Shi Hui alone but feel that he is particularly deserving of recognition. I sincerely hope that fellow art enthusiasts will respond to my words and unite to speak out for justice for drama actors, with the aim of awakening those who run theater troupes and improving their treatment, so that they can improve their standard of living and prevent these flowers blooming for art from withering and fading. This is where we place endless hope for the future of Chinese theater!

Who would have thought that Ma Xiaonong, who played Nurse Chen in "The Widow's Home" and Mrs. Ma in "Little Women," is actually such a young and beautiful girl? Ma Xiaonong is one of the basic actors in the Zhonghua Theater Troupe. She is capable of playing many different roles, but she is most experienced in playing older women, which is due to the shortage of older female actors. She graduated from Wuben Girls' High School, is able to write beautiful characters, and is good at writing. If she can strive for further progress, her future is very promising.

### Accidentally Saw Two Good Plays (Part 1)

— Su Shaoqing

De Wei Performs "Picking Up the Spiked Wheels"
I heard that De Wei received personal instruction from the current leading martial arts actor Shang Heyu. The other day, I happened to see him at a friend's place. I asked him directly about the final scene in "Tie Long Mountain," where he holds a horse whip in one hand and an empty bow in the other, in a crooked stance. How does the Shang school do it? (Shang Heyu used to perform this play frequently in Shanghai and Beijing, rivaling Yang Xiaolou, each with their own strengths. In this pose, Heyu's stance is crooked, with immense power, and is exquisitely beautiful. Xiaolou uses a different pose at this point, unlike Heyu.) My question implicitly contained a test. If he didn't know it, he wouldn't necessarily be a student of Heyu. De Wei was very clear and did not hesitate, immediately saying, "This stance is all reversed." As he spoke, he demonstrated, kicking his legs, turning around, twirling the whip, stepping on the ground with his right foot, and tilting his body. This demonstrated that he was indeed a direct descendant of the Shang school. I really hope to see him perform "Tie Long Mountain" on stage so that I can indulge myself. Watching Shang school martial arts plays is like watching northern-style landscape paintings. I once saw Xia Gui's "Ten Thousand Li of the Yangtze River," where the mountains and rocks are painted with thick ink in a bold axe-cut style, resembling pieces of charcoal. The trees are bizarre and gnarled, with exposed sinews and bones. The water waves are also depicted with thick lines, and the figures punting and sculling are full of real energy. Shang school martial arts plays are similar. De Wei performed "Tie Long Mountain" once in the past half month, but unfortunately, I had other things to do and could not be there, so I had to accept my fate. Yesterday, I went to the Gengxin Stage and saw De Wei's "Picking Up the Spiked Wheels," which is also a major martial arts play. That day, De Wei seemed to be performing with extra effort, and his voice was also in good condition. He sang several northern tunes, which were worth listening to, and also had high notes in his recitative. He performed this play with great intensity, and his courage was very stable. He fully realized the characters' qualities. His face is naturally solemn and dignified, similar to Shang Heyu, making him most suitable for performing Shang school plays. Perhaps heaven created him intentionally to continue the Shang school martial arts plays. I'm not just blindly praising him. Anyone who understands opera can test him in person and see the truth.

### Notes on Yang Shuoqin

— Liu Sheng

The predecessor of the Shuoyun Troupe was the Xiao Jing Ban led by Yi Fangshuo. Although Yi came from the world of comedy, the Shuoyun Troupe's plays strive for excellence and never flow into frivolity. Recently, they temporarily performed at the Tianchan Theater. The first evening's performance was "Farewell My Concubine," with Yi Shuoyun and Yang Shuoqin playing the roles of Overlord and Consort Yu, respectively. Qin and Yun are sisters, both beautiful. Shuoyun's Overlord has sufficient power and bearing and is quite watchable, but due to a lack of natural talent, he fails to convey the heroic spirit of the Overlord.

It is said that Yang Shuoqin's beauty in costume is second to none, even surpassing Wu Suqiu. Her sword dance is particularly beautiful, and a young girl naturally possesses her own captivating charm. Shuoqin has recently received instruction from Zhao Tongshan, who is known as a master of expression. However, he is old and no longer appears natural when playing the role of a young girl. Perhaps his lifelong expertise can be passed on through Shuoqin.

### Tai Lai Photography Exhibition Opens

Photographer Qin Tailai has profound and outstanding artistic achievements in photography, which are rare to find. His solo photography exhibition, featuring over a hundred carefully selected works from past years, will open today on the seventh floor of the Xindu Hotel. This exhibition is expected to bring a unique brilliance to the long-silent world of photography exhibitions. The exhibition is scheduled to last for ten days.

### Sharing Weal and Woe

— He Jia Zhi

— A Feud

Wei Cheng said, "What he says isn't definite. He stops wherever he finds it fun. When we go out, we don't necessarily gamble. We just eat, look around, and then come back in three or five days, or even just three." When Second Wife Ye heard that it would take three or five days, she immediately regretted it, saying, "Why would you be gone for three or five days? This is wrong. Maybe relatives and friends will come later or tomorrow. You all like to play mahjong, but it's polite and civil, not much winning or losing, and it's still fun." Huang Long and Wei Cheng had already made an agreement. Wei Cheng deliberately held his chest with both hands, as if afraid that Second Wife Ye would ask for the money back. Huang Long also squeezed in front of Wei Cheng and explained to Second Wife Ye that Wei Cheng was cooped up at home every day, and there would be no other chance to go out if he didn't take this opportunity. Cui Zhen always liked to help people achieve their goals, especially when it came to Wei Cheng, so she also persuaded Second Wife Ye from the side. Second Wife Ye said, "Then I'll hand Wei Cheng over to Huang Long. You take him out and bring him back safely." Huang Long said "yes" repeatedly.

Huang Long and Wei Cheng ran out into the northwest wind. They walked about three or four miles and saw a small teahouse by the side of the road, with several tea drinkers inside. Some wore silk skullcaps, some wore blue cloth gowns with black silk waistbands, and some wore rabbit-fur cotton shoes. All sorts of people fully displayed the New Year in the countryside. Huang Long and Wei Cheng barged in. The owner-like person nodded and asked if they wanted black or green tea, and immediately brought two pots of tea. In addition, there were two small plates with a few green olives. Wei Cheng laughed and said, "Today there's olive tea. This is truly admirable." Huang Long chewed on the olives, drank the tea, and asked the owner, "Why? Is gambling prohibited this year? It's so quiet, it doesn't feel like New Year." The owner smiled and said, "No, no. The people who come to drink tea are all neighbors, and they can't afford to gamble. If the guests like to play, I can call a few people to keep you company." Before Huang Long could answer, Wei Cheng said, "How can you gamble? We have our own business. Boss, don't listen to him. We have some business to go to Yidun Town." As soon as Wei Cheng mentioned Yidun Town, two people at the next table turned around. (235)
