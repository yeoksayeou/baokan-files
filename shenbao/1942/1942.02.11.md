Tokyo, 10th (Domei News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced this afternoon that the Japanese troops who landed on Singapore Island had completely occupied the Tengah Airfield in the western part of the island at 7:00 PM last night. Singapore Island has four military airfields, and Tengah Airfield is one of them.

Johore Bahru, 10th (Domei News Agency) – The causeway across the Johore Strait, which is 1,000 meters long, was blown up by British troops during their retreat. However, it has been completely repaired overnight by Japanese army engineers under the cover of artillery fire. Japanese reinforcements and various military supplies are now steadily passing through the causeway to supply the Japanese troops who landed on Singapore Island. Furthermore, it is reported that after landing on Singapore, Japanese troops have secured a stronghold at the southern end of the causeway.

Somewhere on Singapore Island, 10th (Domei News Agency) – After Japanese troops occupied the Tengah Airfield in the western part of Singapore Island last night, they have now advanced to a certain location east of the airfield. British troops are resisting along the Tengah River, and the fighting between the two armies is very fierce. It is said that when Japanese troops occupied the Tengah Airfield, they captured ten aircraft and two anti-aircraft guns.

Tokyo, 10th (Domei News Agency) – Japanese reinforcements are steadily passing through the Johore causeway into Singapore Island today. The Japanese troops who have already landed on the island are advancing rapidly along the railway that runs from north to south across the island. Aerial and artillery activity is even more intense at dusk. Japanese troops in the western part of the island, who occupied the Tengah Airfield yesterday, are rapidly advancing inland. Japanese tank units, dive bombers, and artillery units on the shores of the strait are all providing support in the battle.

Singapore, 10th (Havas News Agency) – Officials announced today that after landing on the western coast of Singapore Island, Japanese troops immediately launched an offensive, advancing under the cover of dive bombers. Yesterday, artillery and special machine gun units of the Japanese army fired fiercely throughout the day. The Japanese offensive was fierce, and they also infiltrated behind our lines. After several hours of intense fighting, our troops were forced to retreat again.

Tokyo, 10th (Kaitong News Agency) – The Japanese Army Headquarters in Tokyo stated last night that the Japanese troops who landed on the northwest coast of Singapore Island on Sunday night have attacked the British positions controlling the strait between the mainland and Singapore Island. At the same time, they are advancing towards the Seletar naval port across the Kranji River. Japanese troops have destroyed artillery positions and fortifications in that area, and Japanese reinforcements are steadily arriving on the island.

Saigon, 10th (Kaitong News Agency) – According to various sources, the fall of Singapore is only a matter of time. British, Indian, and Australian troops have retreated from the outer fortresses of Singapore Island to the central highlands. British troops attempted to use tanks to stop the Japanese advance, but were unsuccessful. Japanese troops have occupied a military airfield in the southwest of Singapore Island.

London, 10th (Havas News Agency) – It has just been learned here that the Singapore radio station ceased broadcasting at 10:30 AM this morning (Greenwich Mean Time).

Intense Artillery Fire

Singapore, 10th (Reuters News Agency) – It was learned this morning that after Japanese troops landed on Singapore Island, reinforcements arrived last night. According to soldiers who experienced the last World War, the intensity of the Japanese artillery barrage last week was comparable to what was experienced on the Western Front in Europe, and was further aided by dive bomber attacks. Today, British fighter planes and anti-aircraft guns are very active. Intermittent artillery fire can only be heard in Singapore City, but the sound of artillery gradually intensifies with the use of electricity. A major battle is expected to begin again tonight.

Singapore, 10th (Reuters News Agency) – A communiqué released here today stated that Japanese reinforcements landed on Singapore Island last night at ×××××××××. Japanese aircraft constantly dive-bombed and strafed the forward positions of British troops in the western part of Singapore Island throughout the day. At the same time, Japanese troops continued to apply significant pressure and infiltrated this area. Although British troops put up strong resistance, they still retreated slightly. The north coast of Singapore Island was lightly strafed and shelled by Japanese troops during the night.

Ten Miles from the City

London, 10th (Reuters News Agency) – Responsible sources in London stated today that Japanese troops are currently about ten miles from Singapore City. However, the battle situation is changing rapidly, and it is difficult to say with certainty at what point the Japanese troops are advancing towards Singapore City. According to reports received in London, some locations on Singapore Island have changed hands, and Japanese reinforcements have landed at ××××××××. The two locations are about two miles apart. The Mentai River is a small stream about three-quarters of a mile west of the causeway in the strait, located just north of the railway leading to Singapore City. British defending forces must hold a vast defensive line, so it is not difficult for Japanese troops to gain a local advantage at any point they decide to attack.

Japanese Troops Urge Surrender

London (Reuters News Agency) – According to a broadcast by a German radio station today, Lieutenant General Yamashita, the commander of the Japanese troops attacking Singapore, has requested the surrender of the fortress. Japanese aircraft have dropped tens of millions of leaflets urging surrender.

Rangoon, 10th (Reuters News Agency) – Army authorities announced yesterday that Japanese aircraft attacked British positions on the east bank of the Sittang River, thirty miles north of Moulmein, yesterday morning. In the afternoon, the two armies exchanged fire with rifles and machine guns, but there was no change in the battle situation. Last week, British and Indian bomber planes, escorted by fighter planes, bombed Japanese troops.

Rangoon, 10th (Reuters News Agency) – According to news received this afternoon, there was no change in the Salween River front in the past twenty-four hours. The Governor of Burma made a broadcast last night, warning the public not to lightly believe rumors, and took the opportunity to refute rumors that he had left the city, saying: "I am now in this city and, in addition to inspecting the frontline troops, am determined to stay here."

Bangkok, 10th (Kaitong News Agency) – According to news from Moulmein, Japanese troops shelled the opposite bank of the Salween River on Sunday night and have already crossed the river and advanced. However, neither the British nor Japanese official announcements have confirmed this.

Tokyo, 10th (Domei News Agency) – Japanese troops are expanding their activities in the Dutch East Indies.

This matter has not been confirmed by the Japanese side. Batavia issued warnings twice yesterday.

Saigon, 10th (Domei News Agency) – According to reports from Batavia, the authorities of the Dutch East Indies have acknowledged in today's announcement that Japanese troops have landed in Makassar in southern Celebes Island.

Batavia, 10th (Reuters News Agency) – According to official announcements, Japanese troops landed in Makassar, the capital of Celebes Island, today. Japanese troops are using the waters of Balikpapan Bay in eastern Borneo, apparently sending ships to transport troops. Makassar is an important stopover point for attacking Surabaya, a major naval base on the east side of Java, as it is located about 450 miles northeast of Java and has good harbors and airfields. At the same time, Japanese troops are currently attempting to besiege Banjarmasin in southern Borneo, which is located about 350 miles north of Surabaya. It is also reported that Japanese forces are continuing to concentrate troops in Pontianak in northwestern Borneo. Some people believe that these actions by Japanese troops foreshadow an attack on Batavia, a large port on the west coast of Java, or a simultaneous attack on Batavia and Surabaya.

Batavia, 10th (Reuters News Agency) – A communiqué from the Dutch East Indies military headquarters today stated that Japanese troops have begun landing near Makassar in southwestern Celebes Island. Dutch troops are resisting and have been ordered to carry out destruction. Yesterday (Monday) morning, Japanese bombers attacked eastern Java with twenty aircraft, with their main target being the airfield at Malang. One person was killed and several were injured. Several airfields near Batavia were attacked by Japanese fighter planes and suffered minor damage. Several aircraft on the ground were destroyed, and oil depots caught fire.

Batavia, 9th (Havas News Agency) – According to news from Washington, future operational plans for the entire Far East will be formulated directly by the governments of Great Britain and the United States. General Wavell's authority will be limited to making tactical decisions. There is widespread dissatisfaction after learning of this news. Most newspapers believe that this system will only delay military authorities in making prompt decisions in the event of emergencies, and they strongly oppose it. The influential Java Daily even ran a headline that "Two more committees have been added on top of General Wavell," criticizing the decision. However, British and Dutch officials insist that General Wavell's authority remains very large and that the adoption of the new system will not prevent Wavell from making prompt decisions as circumstances dictate.

### World's Largest Passenger Ship "Normandie" Damaged; Burning for Over Four Hours; Nearly Completely Destroyed

New York, 10th (Havas News Agency) – The luxurious French passenger ship "Normandie" is now aground on a mud bank, so there is no need to cut holes in the ship's hull to allow accumulated water to drain out. Most of the damage to the ship is on the upper decks, but the hull can still be repaired.

New York, 9th (Havas News Agency) – The giant French passenger ship "Normandie" suddenly caught fire at around 2:00 PM today and was in danger of being completely destroyed. There were about 3,000 workers on board at the time, who were evacuated using ropes. The ship was moored at a pier on the Hudson River, which greatly facilitated firefighting efforts and prevented complete destruction. Fortunately, the fire was largely extinguished by 6:45 PM, although a wisp of black smoke could still be seen rising. According to naval officials, the ship was tilted due to excessive water during firefighting, and there was a risk of capsizing for a time. The ship's crew requested firefighters to cut a hole in the ship's side to allow the accumulated water to drain out. It is now reported that the ship is tilted about twenty-five degrees. Seventy-three injured crew members have been sent to hospitals for treatment. Rear Admiral Andrews, the commander of the Third Naval District, made a statement after inspecting the ship, saying that the cause of the fire was probably not sabotage. According to reliable reports, it was caused by an acetylene torch igniting cotton life preservers, and the fire spread, leading to the major disaster. The "Normandie" broke the record of the "Queen Mary" when it crossed the Atlantic in August 1937, sailing 2,936 miles in 94 hours and 7 minutes, winning the Blue Riband.

Vichy, 9th (Havas News Agency) – The "Normandie" is the world's famous ship. Her keel was laid on December 29, 1932, and she was named by President Lebrun on May 23, 1935. She had a displacement of 83,423 tons, was 981 feet 4 inches long, 117 feet 9 inches wide, and 57 feet 6 inches deep. She was equipped with a 160,000 horsepower electric propulsion engine and could reach a maximum speed of 32 knots per hour. She crossed the Atlantic at an average speed of 29.94 knots, winning the Blue Riband. She was later improved, increasing her average speed to 32.20 knots per hour. The ship could accommodate 930 first-class passengers, 680 second-class passengers, and 560 third-class passengers, with a total crew of 1,300. Naval architects from various countries recognize the "Normandie" as the world's leading ship in terms of both technology and art. The interior decoration is also a masterpiece of French art, with all the painting, carving, and arrangement coming from famous French artists.

### Fu Bingchang Entertains Reporters, Discusses the Defense of Burma; Its Importance Should be Seen as the Moscow of the Far East

Chongqing, 10th – Vice Foreign Minister Fu Bingchang made a statement at a reception for Chinese and foreign reporters in the afternoon of the 10th. Vice Minister Fu began by saying that according to recent news, Japanese troops have landed on the west coast of Singapore, and Japanese troops on the banks of the Salween River are also trying to cross the river in an attempt to occupy Taxedo and Pegu, strategically important railway hubs north of Rangoon. We are extremely concerned about this situation, but China will never lose its confidence and courage in the future of the Allied countries' war. However, we are now facing a major test. We would like to particularly point out that if the defense of Burma is successful, the Allied countries can expect China's strength to increase day by day. Conversely, if the Yunnan-Burma Road is cut off by the Japanese, China's difficulties will inevitably increase, and the Allied countries' difficulties will also increase accordingly. Therefore, we are very pleased with General Dennis's statement on the 7th and the Governor of Burma's broadcast speech on the 8th. General Dennis assured us that the British, Indian, and Burmese troops warmly welcome the Chinese troops entering Burma, which is greatly appreciated. Therefore, we must not miss the opportunity to defend Burma, nor must we avoid sacrifice. The defense of Burma should be seen as the Moscow battle of the Far East.

### 法輪達得南號　定期駛返西貢　另兩法輪已先後返海防

The French ship "D'Artagnan" will regularly sail back to Saigon. Two other French ships have already returned to Haiphong.

The two French ships, "Kimberley" and "Albert Sarraut," which arrived in Shanghai from Haiphong in late last month, left port on the 4th and 7th of this month, respectively, returning to Haiphong. The cargo transported from Shanghai was scarce. The French mail ship "D'Artagnan," which arrived in Shanghai at the end of November last year, has been delayed in returning south due to the impact of the Pacific War. The ship originally used a diesel engine, but recently, due to the inability to purchase diesel, it was converted to a coal-burning engine in Shanghai. The conversion is now complete, and it is scheduled to return to Saigon from Shanghai on the 18th of this month, also calling at Haiphong. It is heard that the Shanghai-Vietnam route will be maintained by French ships, but the French company in Shanghai has not yet indicated anything, so there is no definite news as to when a ship will come to Shanghai from Vietnam.

The over-the-counter market for public bonds yesterday was the last day before the Lunar New Year. All firms were preparing to close their accounts during this holiday period in preparation for a red market opening on the fifth day of the first lunar month to reorganize. Yesterday's closing was quite lively. The bulls did not show any weakness, and absorption was still very enthusiastic. Many transactions were closed. The meeting time was extended by half an hour to accommodate buying and selling for those who did not want to delay. Sentiment after closing was quite stable.

Yesterday, the initial atmosphere was strong. Heng Kang Zhen Chang was selling off vigorously, and Class C fell to 70 yuan.

### 麻將風不可長

The Mahjong Craze Should Not Be Encouraged

— Jin Yi

The Chinese people's love for mahjong is like a foreign sailor running into a "bar" for a "Yupi" beer. When three people are sitting idly, they make a phone call to gather a set of four players. Perhaps a friend of a friend shows up, and the host, unwilling to give up their position as a player but also unwilling to exclude the guest, organizes four players with one person "watching the wind." By this analogy, regardless of the number of people, if there is a proposal, everyone is happy to join! Some even turn hostels into their base of operations due to cramped living spaces and inconvenient tea and water arrangements, playing day and night, oblivious to the dawn.

Hostels are not allowed to profit from gambling, but mahjong is an exception. Recently, there has been a new rule stating "playing cards is not allowed past midnight," but with electric lights shining brightly, many rooms stay lit all night. Even offices, shops, and businesses are indulging in this "incredible" activity due to sluggish night markets. According to a clerk at a bone tile shop, while many industries are declining, the sales of mahjong tiles are the most popular. This seems to contradict the restrictions on electricity consumption and daylight saving time. However, some people have said, "Are we not even allowed this little bit of entertainment?" The speakers probably do not admit to gambling for money and only aim for "entertainment." Naturally, their argument is excusable. However, there are many people who are "entertaining" all day and all month but need to find work. This shows that the purpose of "living in this world" is not primarily for "entertainment," especially "at this time." This "craze" must not be encouraged!

### 天才廣吿家

Advertising Genius

— Qian Changnian

There is a "men's" suit shop at the intersection of Avenue Joffre and ××× Road. In the window display is a ten-inch enlarged photograph of a young girl, with bright colors and natural beauty.

I was wondering why a men's clothing store would display a woman's photograph. When I turned around, I saw that the passersby were all young men, and I was immediately impressed and admired the genius.

### 秋海棠

Autumn Begonia

Seventeen: Homecoming

When he came back in again, the Han father and daughter had been invited to sit at the head of the table, Mei Bao was leaning in Xiang Qi's arms, her tears were not yet dry.

"...I also know that you and my brother have probably heard what people have been saying." Xiang Qi was telling her sister-in-law in a rather solemn manner, "Now I don't need to hide it from you any more, this is my own daughter..."

When Shao Hua heard this, he almost shouted out in happiness.

"Good child, she looks just as pretty as her mother!" Jin Yu reached out a hand to stroke Mei Bao's hair, praising her all the while.

Old Han and his daughter also smiled so much that they couldn't close their mouths.

After calming herself down, Xiang Qi busied herself asking about the reason why Mei Bao had wandered to Shanghai; Mei Bao, in front of so many strangers, naturally did not want to tell the whole story, so she picked out what she could say and said it first. She did not mention how she and her father had pawned their belongings to make a living, or how Qiu Haitang had joined the Red Stage and played heroes, or how he had been injured.

Even so, hearing it in Xiang Qi's ears, her heart was more saddened than hearing any other tragic story.

"Then, is your father's illness any better these days?" After Mei Bao finished speaking, Jin Yu couldn't wait to interrupt and ask.

This question reminded Mei Bao and the Han father and daughter.

"Oh dear! We came out today, originally only intending to stay for a few minutes, but now it's been almost half an hour, let's go quickly!" Old Han was the first to stand up and say.

"Mom, what do you think?" Mei Bao raised her tear-stained face and asked Xiang Qi in a low voice, meaning to ask if she could go to that small inn with them right away. (320)
