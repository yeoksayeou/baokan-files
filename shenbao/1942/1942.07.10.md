Other textile factories are also garrisoned by British troops. The British side is still adopting a passive resistance to these constantly occurring strikes. According to observations from Ankara, the Egyptian strikers this time are not only of a social nature but are actually governmental actions resisting British rule.

### Australian Labor and Farmers Parties' Opinions Conflict

### Soviet People's Front Announced Withdrawal from Os'kol City Heavy Fighting West of Voronezh Continues; German Battleship Tirpitz Heavily Damaged

Moscow, August 8th, Havas News Agency - The official report recently announced that after several days of fierce fighting, Soviet forces have withdrawn from Stary Oskol (south of Kursk).

Berlin, August 9th, Domei News Agency - The German High Command announced today that after occupying Kursk and Voronezh, the German army is now conducting mopping-up operations in the area. The German army has also made progress in the Erzhishev area, occupying many strongholds after fierce fighting. In one location, 20 enemy tanks were intercepted. German aircraft discovered enemy vehicles and troops gathered in the jungle and continuously bombed them, causing heavy damage. On the Orel front, enemy troops broke into a village on the 7th of this month but were repelled by German counterattacks. Many other enemy advances also failed. The day before yesterday, German aircraft bombed enemy tank convoys, destroying more than 50 vehicles and assisting the army in combat very smoothly.

Somewhere on the Ukrainian border, August 9th, Havas News Agency - The German army today occupied the two towns of Svoboda and Ostrogozhsk, southeast of Voronezh.

Moscow, August 9th, Havas News Agency - The Pravda newspaper stated that the situation on the west and northwest sides of the Voronezh River is "serious." A small number of enemy tanks and infantry have invaded our defense lines and are making every effort to expand their gains. The enemy has made no progress west of Voronezh. To the north, our army has been forced to retreat. To the northwest, our army launched an attack and recovered several towns.

Stockholm, Sweden, August 8th, Havas News Agency - The Soviet official newspaper published a report stating, "Yesterday, our army fought the enemy west of Voronezh, and the fighting is still fierce. In Stary Oskol, our army has retreated after resisting. There is nothing significant to report in other war zones. In addition, in the Barents Sea, the German battleship "Tirpitz" was hit by two torpedoes fired by our submarines and suffered heavy damage."

Berlin, August 9th, Domei News Agency - The German authorities announced last night that the remnants of the enemy in Voronezh have been cleared. When the Soviet army attacked German positions north of the city, five heavy tanks were destroyed. The German army is pursuing the fleeing enemy southeast of the Don River, occupying many Soviet fortresses. The surrounded enemy troops were attacked by German tanks and aircraft and suffered heavy damage. Four tanks, 13 cannons, and 300 vehicles were hit and caught fire. Railways and six trains in the war zone were also bombed. German aircraft shot down 35 Soviet planes.

Lisbon, August 8th, Allied News Agency - Fierce battles between German and Soviet forces have been raging from the night of the 7th to the 8th in the areas northwest of Voronezh and southwest of Stary Oskol. According to news released by the Soviet Information Bureau in Moscow, the Soviet army made a second retreat from Stary Oskol, a vital point between Voronezh and Kursk. This city, located along the Oskol River, is an important military stronghold. Since the German army launched its general offensive on Kursk, the Soviet army has been defending it to the death. The war situation released by the Soviet Information Bureau on the night of the 8th stated that the Soviet army abandoned Stary Oskol after fierce fighting with the German army in the Voronezh area on the 8th, but it has no major impact on the overall war situation.

Berlin, August 9th, Havas News Agency - The High Command announced this morning that after the German army broke through the Soviet Southern Front, the entire 260-mile-long Soviet line is showing signs of wavering. The German-Romanian Allied forces are now advancing on all fronts. Infantry vanguards are pursuing the retreating enemy. The German Air Force is coordinating with the army, bombing enemy troops day and night. North and northwest of Orel, the army repelled the enemy forces attempting to relieve the siege within four days. The enemy lost 289 tanks. The enemy forces in the Lgov area are surrounded on all sides, and the encirclement is tightening.

Berlin, August 8th, Havas News Agency - According to military sources here, the situation of the Soviet army under the command of Mr. Timoshenko is critical, as the gap broken through by the German army has widened further in the past 24 hours. The clearing of Voronezh has also been completed. Although the Soviet army launched a counterattack north of the city, it was repelled by the German army. German troops advancing eastward turned south yesterday and occupied several strongly fortified villages. In addition, the Soviet army's attempt to force a crossing of the Don River was also repelled by German armored units, suffering heavy losses.

Somewhere on the Soviet border, August 8th, Havas News Agency - German military experts recently stated that the Don River crossing battle is extensive. To avoid being encircled by the German army's large-scale pincer offensive, the Red Army may retreat to the Volga River basin, where the decisive battle will take place. As for where the German army will advance after occupying Voronezh, it is unknown, but it is expected that at least one force will be dispatched to open a bloody path eastward along the Don River in order to expand the encirclement to Rostov and thus completely control the transport line from Voronezh to Rostov. More importantly, the German army may advance eastward along the Svoboda-Balashov railway in order to cut off the Soviet north-south transport line and sever the connection between Moscow and the Caucasus. However, to cut off Caucasus transport, it is necessary to first destroy the Liski-Povorino-Stalingrad-Rostov railway network. If this cannot be achieved, cutting off transport between Moscow and Rostov will have no effect, even if Voronezh is occupied. Although Voronezh has been occupied, the major tank battle southwest of the city has not ended. The Red Army concentrated east and southwest of the city numbers about 40 divisions. A 60-mile stretch along the Don River is firmly under German control, but in terms of the entire front line, it is only a gap. The Red Army can still advance and retreat freely, but the railways on the river have been bombed by the German army, and the Red Army can only evacuate by boat. At present, the Red Army can only gather its remnants in the hope of breaking through. Yesterday, the Red Army's repeated offensives were not only ineffective, but the German pincer encirclement was expanded. At the same time, the German army crossed the Don River about 14 miles southwest of the important railway center of Svoboda, which may form a second pocket to encircle another Red Army force. According to the latest news, the German army in the Sevsk area, which has been dormant for a winter, has also moved out and made contact with other German forces in the rear of the Red Army. The development of the war in that area, which is closer to Moscow, is extremely important.

London Attaches Importance to the Eastern Front Situation

Stockholm, Sweden, August 9th, Domei News Agency - London's "Daily Express" yesterday commented on the severe battles on the Eastern Front, stating that the occupation of Voronezh is the German army's greatest strategic victory on the Eastern Front. The new German victory proves that the Soviet army still lacks combat strength. If the German army can consolidate its occupied positions, the impact on the entire war situation will be significant.

Berne, August 9th, Domei News Agency - The Basel National Daily's London correspondent reported that people in London have taken a pessimistic view of the Eastern Front, as the Soviet army has retreated across the board, and the railway between Moscow and Rostov has been cut off again. The fall of Voronezh has made the situation even more serious. Moscow has also not concealed the serious situation. Pravda warned that the Soviet Union is in great danger and must spare no sacrifice.

Stockholm, Sweden, August 9th, Domei News Agency - According to news received in London last night, London is increasingly worried about the war on the Eastern Front. Although Moscow officials have not admitted the fall of Voronezh, London military experts have stopped commenting on the city and shifted their attention to the fighting in Stary Oskol. All London evening newspapers published lengthy Moscow dispatches, all acknowledging that the situation on the Eastern Front is extremely serious. It is said that the Soviet army has suffered heavy losses, and the German army's attack on the Soviet positions continues unabated. London newspapers commented on the German offensive, saying that the German army's strength and objectives are undoubtedly a serious crisis for the Soviet Union, but the Soviet Union still pins its hopes on General Timoshenko, believing that he can contain the German advance.

A Second Front Must Be Opened

Dublin, August 8th, Havas News Agency - According to news from London, British people do not deny that the Allied forces are in a precarious position on the central front. General Clark's offensive can be regarded as part of a pincer offensive against Allied territories in the Caucasus and the Middle East. Its aim is to link up with Rommel's forces in North Africa. However, the British army is resisting strongly in the El Alamein area of Egypt, giving rise to endless hope that Egypt can be saved. However, to stop the German advance, all kinds of efforts are still needed. According to British military figures, it is absolutely necessary to open a second front quickly. Moreover, the Allied forces are ready to land in Europe. Only because of General Rommel's great victory in North Africa, the Allied plan to divert German forces to reduce the pressure on the Soviet Union has been shattered. London now hopes that the Soviet Union can hold its ground and wait for the British and Americans to launch another offensive. The return of British Ambassador to the United States Lord Halifax shows that discussions between Britain and the United States on opening a second front have made progress. In addition, the British people are prepared to endure another winter war and are deeply aware that they will encounter more serious difficulties in food supplies at the end of this year.

Stockholm, Sweden, August 8th, Havas News Agency - Renowned Soviet journalist Zaslavsky published an article in Pravda entitled "The Time Factor," in which he heavily criticized hesitant, incompetent, and incapable people who do not know when to advance and retreat, and who only benefit the enemy. The article stated that the German High Command hopes to continue to adopt the "divide and conquer" strategy, so the German people hope to defeat the Soviet Union before a second front is opened in Western Europe. However, thanks to the heroic resistance of the Red Army, the Allied forces have gained ample time to prepare. At present, the Allied forces already possess everything to prevent Hitler from realizing his 1942 victory plan. In the Soviet Union, they must do everything possible to fulfill their most important mission, but the world must still understand that the "time factor" is extremely important, so they should act quickly to prevent Germany from expanding the armaments industry in the occupied areas. In short, victory cannot be achieved without effort. We must strive for it through action.

Berne, Switzerland, August 8th, Havas News Agency - The "Neue Zürcher Zeitung" carried a London dispatch stating that U.S. military expert Colonel Seversky published an article in the Daily Mail, stating that large-scale bombing of Germany is the only rapid and effective way to aid the Soviet Union, as opening a second front is too dangerous and the current strength of the Allied forces is not sufficient to discuss this. The only possible way is to bomb Germany with thousands of aircraft every two or three days.

### Saracoğlu Succeeds as Turkish Prime Minister Saydam's Funeral Held Today

Istanbul, August 9th, Domei News Agency - According to an announcement by the Secretary-General of the Turkish President, Foreign Minister Saracoğlu has been appointed as the successor Prime Minister to form a new cabinet.

Ankara, Turkey, August 8th, Havas News Agency - Government officials recently stated that the sudden death of Prime Minister Saydam will have no impact on Turkey's absolute neutrality in the current war. The successor Prime Minister has not yet been appointed. The reason why Interior Minister Tüzemen is temporarily acting as Prime Minister is because all important cabinet ministers were on vacation when Saydam passed away, and only Tüzemen remained in the capital. Generally, Foreign Minister Saracoğlu and Government Party Secretary-General Eson Dada have the highest hopes of being selected as the new Prime Minister. There will not be any changes in the cabinet organization. In short, it is regrettable that Prime Minister Saydam passed away at a time when the situation was extremely delicate, preventing him from exercising his outstanding talents to maintain the consistent policy of strict neutrality since the outbreak of the war. Because of past incidents in the country, the political and diplomatic situation in the Middle East has gradually changed with the German offensive on the Soviet Union.

Ankara, August 9th, Domei News Agency - The Turkish Cabinet held a special meeting yesterday to discuss various issues after the death of Prime Minister Saydam, chaired by Interior Minister Tüzemen. It is also reported that Saydam's body will be moved from Istanbul to Ankara, and then a state funeral will be held tomorrow.

Bulgarian Prime Minister Filov sent a telegram to the Turkish Foreign Minister to express his condolences.

Stockholm, Sweden, August 9th, Domei News Agency - A spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry stated that Turkish Prime Minister Saydam had died of heart disease. Saydam was a successful figure in implementing Turkey's policy of neutrality. His aim was to safeguard Turkey's independence and the integrity of its territorial sovereignty. The defense agreement signed between Turkey and Britain and the friendship treaty with Germany are both in line with this principle.

Sofia, August 9th, Domei News Agency - The death of Turkish Prime Minister Saydam has made a deep impression in Bulgaria.

### Germany Entrusts Its Interests in Arabia to Turkey for Management

Ankara, August 9th, Domei News Agency - The Arab Physicians Congress, scheduled to be held in Beirut in August, has been canceled due to the tense situation in the Near East.

### Allied Positions in El Alamein Occupied by Axis Forces All Allied Forces to Concentrate in Alexandria

Rome, August 9th, Domei News Agency - Today's Italian military report stated that after several days of fierce fighting, the Axis forces have driven the Allied forces out of important positions in the El Alamein area and are now occupied by the German-Italian Allied forces. The Axis air force assisted the army in combat, bombing enemy concentrations of troops and vehicles with considerable success.

Rome, August 9th, Domei News Agency - The Italian High Command issued a statement this afternoon stating that the enemy forces in the El Alamein area of Egypt were severely attacked by the German-Italian Allied mechanized units and tank corps, suffering heavy losses and retreating. The Allied forces occupied several key points. German aircraft heavily bombed Allied troop and motorcycle concentrations. When Allied aircraft took to the skies to intercept, eight were shot down. The important military bases of Micabba and Luca on Malta were attacked by German bombers. Enemy aircraft engaged, and ten were shot down. One of our aircraft did not return to its original defense. Our naval reconnaissance unit patrolled the Mediterranean, escorting convoys, and discovered two enemy submarines, both of which were sunk by the Italian torpedo boat "Alsoppie Gasso."

Istanbul, August 8th, Domei News Agency - According to neutral sources from Cairo, the Axis and Allied forces on the Egyptian El Alamein front are actively rebuilding their positions. The Allied side is using Alexandria as its last line of defense. General Auchinleck will concentrate all of his forces in that area. Currently, the first-line Allied forces are still the South African army and the New Zealand army, which has just arrived from Palestine. Although General Auchinleck personally went to the front line to direct operations, the initiative is still with Rommel's army. The unstable situation in Egypt has not eased, and the Axis forces are actively preparing to launch a major offensive. Recently, large reinforcements and a large number of tanks have been landed in Tobruk. Once preparations are complete, the new offensive will be launched.

Rome, August 8th, Havas News Agency - Italian sources recently stated that the warring parties on the Egyptian front are taking advantage of the current lull to reorganize their forces. For the German-Italian Allied forces under General Rommel, having advanced 400 miles in 12 days, a reorganization is certainly needed. It can be seen that the Axis forces' temporary halt in their advance is purely General Rommel's decision and not due to Allied resistance in El Alamein, Egypt, as the fortifications there are far inferior to those in Tobruk and Mersa Matruh. There is no such thing as an Axis setback. On the contrary, new forces have arrived from Italy to the front line. British General Auchinleck believes that this Egyptian war concerns the fate of Britain, so he is willing to use all kinds of methods to buy time to gain the opportunity for reinforcements. Although the British air force in Egypt has been greatly strengthened, Axis aircraft are also very active and have heavily damaged the Allied forces in recent days.

Berlin, August 9th, Domei News Agency - Domei News Agency learned from military sources last night that the participation of American troops in the North African campaign has not been confirmed by the German side. Regarding the news spread by the American side that American troops have already participated in combat on the front line, even the British news has not mentioned this. Berlin believes that this matter is a planned deception of the American people or another exaggeration by the United States.

Stockholm, Sweden, August 9th, Domei News Agency - According to a Swedish correspondent in London, very little news from the Egyptian front was received in London last night. There were no major changes on the El Alamein front. There was only artillery fire between the two sides, and the Allied air force was also active. All British correspondents in Cairo issued warnings not to be optimistic about the war, as Marshal Rommel is constantly receiving reinforcements and will soon counterattack. The London military believes that large-scale battles will continue, the result of which will either be General Rommel advancing to the Nile Delta or retreating to the Egyptian border. Several London newspapers urged General Auchinleck to advance before the German forces receive reinforcements.

Sofia, August 9th, Domei News Agency - Some of the British 9th and 10th Corps, which were hastily sent to Egypt to fight, have various types of tanks, including war material supplied by the United States to the Soviet Union. The reason is that U.S. ships transporting war material to the Soviet Union originally stopped at Basra, but due to the urgency of the situation in Egypt, they were temporarily rerouted to Aruba and other ports. Therefore, Marshal Rommel's offensive completely foiled the U.S. plan to establish bases for attacking Europe in Syria and Iraq. The defense of Syria is now the responsibility of a mixed force of Tegart-led Greeks and British troops, which are not very strong. The British authorities in Palestine recently convened a defense conference with Jewish representatives. According to Mayor Tiller of Tel Aviv, the Arabs of Palestine refused to participate in the local defense preparations, so the defense of Palestine has to be the responsibility of the Jewish army. Liu Mi, chairman of the Jewish Committee, hopes that all Jews, including women and children, will be mobilized to participate in defense work, because in addition to the property of the Jews in that area, their investment in the armaments industry amounts to hundreds of millions of pounds, which is a great contribution to Britain.

### French Ships in Alexandria Issue Under Discussion U.S. and France Hold Talks

Vichy, August 9th, Domei News Agency - It was officially announced that French government chief Laval met with U.S. Chargé d'Affaires to Vichy, Tuck, on Tuesday. Political figures believe that the topic of discussion will not go beyond the scope of the issue of the French ships in Alexandria. However, French officials have not made any announcements. The U.S. had previously proposed having U.S. ships escort these French ships to U.S. ports and then detaining them until the end of the war. This proposal was difficult for the French side to accept. The French side has repeatedly stated that it will never allow its fleet to be used by any foreign country. The French government's opinion is that it would be most appropriate to have the French ships sail to Bizerte or other French ports on the Mediterranean coast, so that the neutrality of the ships can be maintained.

### Reported Suez Canal Navigation Obstructed

Tokyo, August 9th, Domei News Agency - According to unconfirmed reports from Ankara received in Vichy, Axis aircraft dropped magnetic mines and drifting mines in the Suez Canal, which has greatly damaged canal traffic, and the section near El Kantara is no longer navigable. In addition, Axis aircraft also bombed the railroad from the canal to Port Said.

### Second Phase of Grain Distribution: Rice and Flour Rations, Prices to be Announced This Saturday

Prices to be Announced This Saturday: Yesterday morning, four hundred and fifteen rice shops in the Public Concession collected their sales permits from the Grain Office and made payments on the same day. In the afternoon, from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM, they received warehouse receipts and collected white rice and broken rice from the Taikoo and Xingye warehouses, and flour from the Taikoo warehouse. The total quantity withdrawn by the 415 shops was 12,392 bags of white rice, 6,198 bags of broken rice, and 51,049 bags of flour.

French Concession to Collect Today

Yesterday was designated for the 244 rice shops in the French Concession to collect their sales permits from the Municipal Council Grain Office. Payments were limited to between 2:00 PM and 4:00 PM. They received warehouse receipts and collected white rice and broken rice from the Taikoo and Xingye warehouses, and flour from the Taikoo warehouse. The total quantity withdrawn by the 244 shops was 6,646 bags of white rice, 3,325 bags of broken rice, and 27,865 bags of flour. The above-mentioned allocation of rice and flour is limited to before the 11th of this month.

Second Phase Distribution Quantity

According to inquiries made by a Datong News Agency reporter, after the rice shops in the two concessions have completed the distribution of the first phase rations, they will begin distributing the second phase rations from the 13th of this month, based on the second coupon of the rice purchase certificate. The amount will be one *sheng* of white rice, half a *sheng* of broken rice, and one and a half *jin* of flour. The price will be announced this Saturday. Approximately seventy to eighty percent of the first phase household rations have already been purchased, with no signs of crowding. It is expected that all purchases will be completed by the 11th of this month.

Deadline for Supplementing Rice Coupons

The rice coupon distribution offices in each district will handle supplementary distributions for those who have not yet received rice purchase certificates, starting from the 6th of this month. Households without donation tickets to present can also apply for application forms starting from the 6th of this month, to be stamped and certified by the *baozhang*. The above-mentioned supplementary distribution matters are limited to tomorrow (the 11th). Therefore, those who have not yet received rice coupons should prepare their procedures by this final date to supplement and receive rice purchase certificates. Those who miss the deadline will not be able to receive the first phase of household rice.

Flour Ration Doubled

The Municipal Council Grain Office originally planned to allocate four times the amount of flour as rice for the second phase to the rice shops in the two concessions. However, the rice shops requested a reduction due to difficulties in economic turnover, so it has been reduced to only twice the amount. For example, for every 35 bags of rice, 70 bags of flour will be allocated. However, each bag of flour weighs 49 pounds and has a cost price of 100 storage notes.

Rice Distribution Measures for Guards and Servants

The Municipal Council Public Relations Office announced that guards, patrolmen, and other servants within the Public Concession who are unable to receive rice coupons because their residences do not have any donation tickets can have their employers contact the rice purchase certificate distribution offices in their respective districts to apply for supplementary coupons.

### Credit Loans for Banks and Firms: Tightening Measures

The member banks and firms of the United Association of Silver and Money Industries, in compliance with orders to strictly handle loans secured by goods, have decided to implement tightening measures for credit loans, such as long-term credit loans and revolving overdrafts, to avoid fueling speculation and hoarding, and to stabilize the people's livelihood. Long-term credit loans are the main business of various exchange and remittance firms, with each term lasting six months. The end of April and the end of October each year are the periods for returning and renewing long-term credit loans. It has now been stipulated that these loans, in addition to requiring reliable guarantors, are limited to members of the respective industry associations who are developing their businesses for legitimate purposes, with particular emphasis on the transport and sales of domestic and Sichuan products. Revolving overdrafts must have a guarantor who provides a guarantee, stating the limit in yuan. If the amount cannot be cleared by the end of the year, the guarantor shall repay the outstanding amount and interest in full and voluntarily waive the right of prior litigation defense. Interest rates shall be calculated according to the market rates for deposits and debts agreed upon by the association at the end of each month.

### French Authorities Agree to Amend Pawnshop Regulations

Since the French Concession authorities promulgated the regulations for the pawnshop industry, the industry had once suspended pawning and waiting for redemption. Subsequently, the pawnshop association and pawnshop union persuaded them to resume business and separately petitioned the French Concession authorities and the French Police Department to amend the regulations. It is now learned that the French authorities have accepted the industry's opinions, and the areas to be amended have been signed off on by the industry item by item. Therefore, this matter is now on the path to resolution.

### Mr. Zhang Xiaosheng's Righteous Act of Providing Living Expenses for Mrs. Chen Huang of the French Concession

Mrs. Chen Huang, residing at No. 225 Gan Village, Gan Shi Dong Road, French Concession, was struggling with life.  Furthermore, she was mistakenly blamed for the loss of her mistress's jewelry, and rashly attempted suicide.  She closed herself in a room with her children and attempted to perish together by using a coal stove. As a result, Mrs. Chen Huang and two daughters were fortunately rescued and resuscitated, while the two sons died one after another.  For a time, all sectors of society were saddened.  Mr. Zhang Xiaosheng, with a generous heart, has donated 100 storage notes, entrusting this newspaper to forward them in order to help the family with their current living expenses. This noble deed is truly admirable.  Righteous people are expected to express sympathy. The funds will be sent by special delivery from this newspaper.

### Road Worker Beats Fellow Townsman to Death, Arrested

Liu Gu, a native of Jiangbei residing at No. 17 Linsen Fang, Zhonghua Road, Nanshi, and Li Derong, had a dispute with a fellow townsman named Xiao Zhang over road work at 4:00 PM on the 30th of last month. They fought each other, and as a result, Xiao Zhang suffered fatal injuries and died. Liu and Li then fled to the home of a friend on Shoutel Road, Yangshupu, and lived in seclusion. Yesterday afternoon at 10:00 PM, Su Yinggen, a detective from the Yangshupu police station, arrested them and detained them pending investigation.

### Banking Sector Agrees on Rent Measures: 75% Conversion for Collecting Storage Notes, Implemented Unanimously from June, Overcollected Funds to be Returned to Second Landlords

Shanghai News Agency reports that the real estate departments of various banks in this city have stipulated that rents, which were previously in old legal tender, should be converted to Central Reserve Bank Notes (儲券) at 75% of the original amount. For example, if the rent was originally 100 yuan in old legal tender, it is now converted to 75 yuan in Central Reserve Bank Notes. This measure will be implemented starting from June. Rents before June will be paid and received at the actual price of the original amount. The issue of changing the currency conversion ratio for rent arose in early April. At that time, some housing management offices in the French Concession requested second landlords to pay rent in Central Reserve Bank Notes. By May and June, there were significant disputes over the collection and payment of rent in converted currency. Second landlords insisted on conversion at a 50% discount, while first landlords demanded full or 60% to 60% conversion to collect Central Reserve Bank Notes. This led to confusion and a lack of uniform standards. Consequently, rent collection and payment were suspended, and an investigation into the actual situation was initiated. It was deemed unfair to convert rent at a 50% discount, but full conversion was also unreasonable. After repeated consultations, a compromise was reached: a 75% conversion rate for collecting Central Reserve Bank Notes, implemented starting from the June payment. If the June rent has not yet been collected or paid, it should be supplemented according to this guideline. If the June rent was collected exceeding this stipulated discount, the first landlord should return the excess amount to the second landlord. The collection and payment of rent between first and second landlords, and between second landlords and third tenants, should also follow this guideline.

### Mei Lanfang's Flight to Shanghai Postponed

Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, people from all walks of life have been concerned about the whereabouts of film queen Hu Die and the king of the Peking opera world, Mei Lanfang, who resided in Hong Kong. However, the two places were separated, and news was scarce. Concerned people could only be concerned. Later, people who transited from Hong Kong via Guangzhou to Shanghai learned that the two artists were safe in Hong Kong. After that, news came from Mei's close friends that Mei and Hu would return to Shanghai as soon as ships were available. When movie star Gao Zhanfei arrived in Shanghai, people asked about Mei and Hu's situation, and he only reported that they were safe, without mentioning a date of return. But a month ago, a "Movie News" dedicated to war movies suddenly issued an extra, with thousands of words, saying that the plane Hu Die and Mei were on had crashed into the sea, and they had already been buried in the belly of the fish. The situation was like the "Yu Yin" incident, and the paper was indeed expensive in Luoyang, but "sales" and "facts" were not proportional. Readers' mentality was just curiosity, and no one would trust this "exclusive secret". Other newspapers also refuted the rumors. However, whether Mei and Hu had started their journey to Shanghai was still unconfirmed. The day before yesterday (8th), this newspaper received a report from a friend of Mei, saying that Mei had decided to fly to Shanghai yesterday (9th). This news was indeed true. That friend of Mei also notified Mei's residence on Masnan Road to welcome him. This is the origin of this newspaper's news yesterday about "Mei Lanfang Flying to Shanghai."

Yesterday at noon, this newspaper sent a special reporter to Mei's residence to visit, but when this newspaper arrived at Masnan Road, according to the servant who answered the door, they had sent someone to the airport to welcome the gentleman. The reporter asked whether Mei would return to the mansion to rest after arriving in Shanghai, or whether he would have another place to stay. The servant shook his head - perhaps this was the truth, how could he know where his master would rest? Rather than waiting there in vain, it was better to find that friend of Mei who reported the news to us first, but because of repeated inquiries and visits, it was almost 5 PM when we met him.

The reporter first thanked him for the good intention of reporting the news, and then asked him if he could introduce him to Mei Lanfang.

But unexpectedly, his answer was: I'm very sorry, Mr. Mei did not arrive in Shanghai today!

"Did not arrive in Shanghai?" I almost didn't trust my hearing.

"Please listen to my report. It was last night that I got the news from a reliable source that Mr. Mei would return to Shanghai by plane today. Mr. × of your newspaper and I are old friends, so I reported this news to him in the phone. However, this morning, Mr. Mei's family did send someone to the airport. There was a German reporter who was specially authorized to come to Shanghai by plane. According to that German reporter, Mr. Mei is currently in Guangzhou. If there is no temporary change of plan tomorrow (i.e., today) and the weather is clear, it is at this time that he should be returning to Shanghai.

"For the sake of my one phone call, so many people were disturbed, I really feel uneasy, but it shows everyone's concern for Mr. Mei. I thank you on his behalf! If he arrives in Shanghai tomorrow, my first phone call will be to inform you, sir..."

This is how the conversation ended. Although I did not meet Mr. Mei, who is said to have grown a beard now, the rumors of Mei's crash into the sea have been proven to be false, and he will be returning to Shanghai soon, which is not in vain for a day's running around.

### Shanghai's Heatwave Persists, City Like a Boiling Pot Yesterday, Temperature 96.8 Degrees

According to inquiries made by a Datong News Agency reporter, the heatwave in this city has not subsided, and yesterday it was even more severe. The highest temperature rose to 96.8 degrees (36 degrees Celsius), making it one of the hottest days since the beginning of summer this year. The entire day was filled with scorching sun, as if in a furnace. Even sitting indoors and constantly fanning oneself, sweat still poured out. The Shanghai Epidemic Hospital on Zhizhao Xiang Road saw an increase of over 500 outpatients yesterday. As for Huang Shunqing, who had genuine cholera at the hospital, after he passed away without being saved, his family went to the hospital yesterday to buy a coffin for his funeral. The condition of the remaining eleven patients is still good.

### Unveiling the Mystery of "Yin" and "Yu": Lawyer Yu Xiangqin Announces the Real Names of Both Parties: "Yin" is Xu Maochang, "Yu" is Zui Yixian

"Yin" is Xu Maochang, "Yu" is Zui Yixian: Datong News Agency reports that a person using the pseudonym "Yin" has been continuously placing advertisements in the newspaper for a month and a half. The content of the advertisements expresses a desire for the return of "Yu"女士, with mournful and touching language. This has sparked speculation and debate in society, serving as a topic of conversation. As of the time of this reporter's writing, this sealed gourd-style riddle has been completely broken. This Datong News Agency reporter has visited and recorded the details as follows:

Cohabitation began three years ago

According to sources of the Datong News Agency, the "Yin" gentleman who signed the advertisements in Guangzhi is actually Xu Maochang, the second son of the late Ningbo gentleman residing in Shanghai, Xu Qingyun. The Xu family started with fabric and cloth. The eldest son is Xu Maotang, the manager of Zhonghui Bank. Both brothers are prominent figures in Shanghai society. Xu Maochang's legal wife is the daughter of Qin Runqing, a leader in the finance industry. They have been family friends for generations. However, since their marriage, their feelings have been ordinary. Xu often frequented singing venues. Three years ago, he fell in love with the lady Zui Yixian, who is good at performing Shuangzhufeng. Soon after, they began cohabiting.

Building a Secret Love Nest

Zui Yixian, that is, the "Yu" lady referred to in Xu's advertisements, is Jin Yuzhen, a native of Suzhou. She is 25 years old this year. Miss Jin Yuzhen originally lived at No. 17, Alley 3, Taiyuan Fang, Aidao Ya Road, cohabiting with her mother, Jin Guo, and brother, Jin Xiaofang (i.e., Zui Yichang). After Xu and Jin fell in love, they soon rented a house on West Acorn Road. Xu and Jin have been cohabiting for three years. Although they have not been able to achieve the goal of marriage, their feelings are very good. The above is the story of how the two fell in love and began cohabiting. The following is the story of Xu and Jin's breakup and departure, and the current situation of mediation and reconciliation, which was told by Lawyer Yu Xiangqin during the reporter's visit:

A Talk with Lawyer Yu Xiangqin

According to Lawyer Yu:

According to Lawyer Yu, the "Yin" and "Yu" incident was originally very ordinary, but society has paid so much attention to it, which is unexpected. Some publications have made up and exaggerated the story, and speculators have used it to attract business. Therefore, since she was entrusted by Miss Jin to issue a statement in the newspaper, she has advocated using real names and facts to correct society and clarify the truth.

### After the Reopening of the Bank of Communications and the Central Bank, Branches Will Reopen Simultaneously, Operating Guidelines Will Not Change, Issuance Rights Have Been Completely Abolished

Central News Agency reports that regarding the handling of the Bank of Communications and the Central Bank, a joint committee has been organized by China and Japan and held its first meeting yesterday. A handling plan was decided, and the rights of shareholders and depositors who are determined to be non-hostile will be protected. The committee began working on all domestic and foreign debts and other matters starting yesterday. It is learned that after the handling is completed, the reopening issue is being formulated into a concrete plan. Generally, the operations of the two banks will be no different from the past. The original branches in various locations will also be reopened in sequence. Under the guidance of the Central Reserve Bank, the business will be promoted. However, the right of issuance has been completely abolished.

Reason for Leaving

It is also said that Yin 君 is indeed Mr. Xu Maochang, and Yu 女士 is indeed Zui Yixian. The departure of Yu 女士 this time was purely a misunderstanding within the family. The date on which she had an argument with Yin 君 was May 18th, at their residence on West Acorn Road. Yu 女士 left the residence on the 19th and went to another location. Therefore, she only learned about the advertisements placed by Yin 君 after returning to Shanghai on the 5th of this month. Although the two have not yet met, they have indirectly communicated by telephone. This matter may develop further in the next few days, and a meeting is expected to be arranged. Yu 女士 is very moved by Yin 君's deep affection for her. So far, what can be revealed is only this much. There will be an opportunity to report on the concrete facts in the near future. Lawyer Yu's conversation stopped there with a sigh, and the reporter then said goodbye and left.

A Brief History of Miss Jin

After this incident attracted social attention, Miss Yu has undoubtedly become the protagonist of the incident, and Lawyer Yu has repeatedly praised her, saying that she is beautiful both inside and out, has a great demeanor, and speaks eloquently. The Datong News Agency will now explore and record her brief history as follows: Zui Yixian, originally named Jin Yuzhen, is originally from Wolong Street in Suzhou City. At the age of thirteen, she learned the art of performance from her brother Yichang). She is skilled at telling Shuangzhufeng, depicting the tone of Wen Bizheng and Ni Fengjie, and is admired by storytellers. She first performed in Shatou, Taicang. At this time, she used the name Jin Yuzhen. After returning to Suzhou, she changed her stage name to Zui Yixian. After coming to Shanghai, she performed at Jiuzhongyi Zhengjia Muqiao Nanfang (Aidao Ya Road) and Nanjing North Shanxi Road, and her reputation rose.

### Bund Park: Night Market Restored for Cold Drinks and Western Food

The cold drink and Western food section specially set up in Bund Park has recently restored its night business starting from the 8th of this month, due to the hot weather and crowded tourists, in order to facilitate cool drinks and refreshments. Special economic dinners and set menus are available, and all kinds of cold drinks are available.

### Municipal Council General Manager Okazaki Broadcasts Speech Last Night, Reviewing Shanghai Before and After the War

D盟 News Agency 本埠 reports that the Municipal Council General Manager Okazaki Katsuo broadcast a speech last night, reviewing the reorganization and reconstruction work in Shanghai during the past seven months of the war, and predicting the bright future of Shanghai. Okazaki氏 said that the transformation of Shanghai should be carried out in accordance with the principle of 共榮圈, in order to revive this commercial port and make it an important industrial and commercial center in the East Asian orbit. 氏 emphasized maintaining the importance of Shanghai, so that it becomes one of the main centers within the 共榮圈, and explained that the success of excluding the forces of Britain, the United States, and Chongqing is the initial step in restoring the importance of Shanghai, and then carrying out a comprehensive transformation plan, including administration, finance, economy, and culture, so that Shanghai adapts to the wartime of isolating Britain and the United States. On this point, 氏 expressed great satisfaction with the friendly cooperation between the Municipal Council, the French Municipal Council, and the Shanghai Municipal Government. 氏末後述及财财政之改组, pointing out that the drastic measures adopted by the Municipal Council are to make up for the shortages over the years since the occurrence of the China Incident. 氏转而论及币制情形, believes that it is the center of all economic policies, and points out that reform within this scope is impossible without full promotion within the two concessions. 氏 also said that the rise in prices is an inevitable result of Chongqing's inflationary policy. To curb the rise, it is necessary to freely exchange new legal tender for old legal tender. The success of the previous monetary improvement system should be the prelude to the smooth implementation of other economic plans stipulated in the general procedure. 氏竭力指斥一般人认为近物价高涨, 与改成新法币标准有关之意见。 His explanation is that changing to the new legal tender standard is to prevent the public from being hit by the excessive issuance of old legal tender. Therefore, managing prices should be considered in two aspects: (1) Restricting the prices of key products, such as rice prices, stabilizing the market prices of other goods based on this standard, and severely punishing violators. (2) In terms of economics and morality, merchants and consumers must not manipulate and hoard. 氏 at the end attributed the most difficult problem to the delay in restoring transportation and facilitating traffic to other economic centers. 氏 also urged the citizens of Shanghai to fully cooperate in this area, and the great task in Shanghai has yet to be completed.

### Bicycles: Periodic Licensing, Number of Vehicles Increases Sharply, License Registration May Be Crowded

Datong News Agency reports that since last December, bicycles have risen to prominence as a substitute for privately owned cars in this city. Many citizens with slightly more affluent economies have purchased these vehicles for transportation. Although the Municipal Council has issued a notice regarding the date for purchasing the next year's vehicle licenses, many people are still unclear about it. It is learned that the license registration offices in the two concessions will begin processing license registration on the 15th of this month. It is generally speculated that due to the increase in the number of bicycles this year, there will inevitably be crowding when registering for licenses.

### Emergency Epidemic Hospitals: Patients Increase Sharply, Mostly Typhoid, Enteritis, and Dysentery, Fortunately No Genuine Cholera Found

Shanghai Emergency Epidemic Hospital No. 3, 47A Daxilu Road, has seen a sharp increase in the number of people seeking treatment since the third epidemic prevention section opened last month. Most cases are typhoid, gastroenteritis, and dysentery. Fortunately, according to the examination reports, no genuine cholera has been found.

No matter whether it is outpatient or inpatient, the diagnosis fee and medicine costs are free of charge. The poor and sick can go for treatment without any introduction. The hospital address is 47A Daxilu Road, telephone number 22395.

### Coal Brick Transportation Requires Permits, Deadline for Receiving This Term is the 10th

In view of the fact that the coal brick market situation has been adjusted and transactions in the coal industry are no longer necessary, the Greater China Coal Numbering Association has requested the United Association of Coal Retailers to forward a notice, announcing the temporary suspension of business starting from the 1st of this month. At the same time, the transportation of coal brick in stock also requires applying to the relevant authorities for the issuance of a "Transportation Permit," the purpose of which is to prevent unscrupulous merchants from profiting at high prices and smuggling it into the Sichuan territory. The deadline for applying for transportation permits for the coal brick already sold by retailers in this period is the 10th of this month. Failure to apply for and receive the permit before the deadline will be regarded as abandonment. However, those who need transportation permits must pay the buyer's payment as soon as possible.

### Third Student Aid Fund: Donations Break Record, Mrs. Wu Donates Generously 5,000 Yuan

The student aid fund of this newspaper has been promoted and encouraged by the sympathy of society, and has finally been successful. Since the start of the third session, donations from all walks of life have been enthusiastic. Yesterday, Mrs. Wu generously donated 5,000 yuan, breaking the donation record for this session. Colleagues are deeply inspired and thank Mrs. Wu on behalf of the poor students and wish her good health. Mr. Yan Dayou and others saved money from banquets and transferred the funds to student aid. Chen Hong and his brothers donated funds to student aid in memory of their late sister, which is also a sincere act of gratitude. The student aid funds received yesterday included 5,000 yuan from Mrs. Wu, 300 yuan from Yan Dayou, Sun Lijin, Chen Jia芝 Wu Jun三 (savings from banquets), and 20 yuan from Chen Hong and Chen Yuan (in memory of their late sister Chen Ganbao), totaling 5,320 yuan in Central Reserve Bank Notes.

### Vegetable Price Stability: No Hasty Actions Planned; Otherwise, the City Will Have No Vegetables to Purchase; Suburban Vegetable Prices Cannot Be Controlled

According to the Central China Times, regarding the issue of controlling the prices of vegetables, pork, poultry, and other market foods in the Public Concession, a Municipal Council official stated yesterday that this is a very complex problem. If we resort to severe measures, fresh food will likely disappear from this port.

Difficulty in Finding Price Control Targets

Officials from the Municipal Council's Price Control Committee and the Health Department jointly discussed the issue of vegetable prices in the Public Concession. The consensus was that controlling the price of vegetables is not as easy as it seems on the surface. These officials further explained that, especially in the summer, the perishable nature of food will make it difficult for wholesalers to comply. One official stated that finding the sources and routes of vegetables, poultry, eggs, and other foods, as well as those who profit from them, is extremely difficult and not as straightforward as finding price control targets in shops, restaurants, or hotels in the city.

Inadvisable to Take Severe Measures

Furthermore, when imposing fines on shops, the authorities are not afraid of retaliation through the shops' refusal to sell goods, as the authorities know that there are many channels for goods to enter the city. However, the situation regarding vegetable price controls is quite different. One official stated that controlling profiteers in the Public Concession's vegetable markets would be detrimental to the authorities themselves. Moreover, if harsh measures are adopted in the vegetable markets, the public, without understanding the gravity of the matter, will see such reforms as superfluous.

Must Start with the Suburbs First

The official solemnly stated that if hasty measures are taken to deal with vegetable vendors, one possible outcome is that there will be no vegetable supply in this port. Furthermore, setting price limits can, at most, only affect local Chinese vegetable vendors. If we fail to implement price controls in the suburbs, it will be difficult to restrict the prices of local vegetable vendors.

Livestock Imports Gradually Decreasing

Regarding controlling meat prices, the official stated that it is slightly easier. However, the import of livestock is not as abundant as in the past. The reason why the import of livestock from certain areas is gradually decreasing is that due to high meat prices, the populous cities there are unable to afford it. In the same areas, the number of livestock slaughtered in May was 25% higher than in the previous month.

Chamber of Commerce Issues Notice

The price of eggs is currently extremely high. As the weather gets warmer, the production of eggs is bound to decrease. Therefore, the prices of poultry such as chickens and ducks will increase even more in the heat. He also stated that the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce has issued a notice ordering all members to comply with the authorities' order of June 15, converting old legal tender to Central Reserve Certificates at a ratio of two to one. The official further stated that he hopes all members of the chamber will accept the notice and obey the order. After explaining why it is inappropriate to use strong-arm tactics to deal with vegetable market prices, the Municipal Council official stated that he does not intend to be an advocate for vegetable vendors, but is only offering a brief explanation from his own standpoint.

### Preparing for Exams (1)

— Hu Zuyin

As the sweltering heat torments people and the party spirit拂面, the academic programs of various schools at all levels in Shanghai are coming to an end. In the blink of an eye, the autumn coolness will arrive, and the next semester will begin. Aspiring students, whether transferring to other schools, advancing from primary school to middle school, or progressing from middle school to university or vocational school, must all go through the hurdle of entrance examinations. How to prepare and how to take the exams are concerns that students value. This newspaper has specially invited Dr. Hu Zuyin, a professor of education at Shanghai University, to draft this article, which prospective students can regard as a guide.

The very term "examination" can evoke a state of tension in many people's minds. This is especially true for those who have extensive examination experience, as they will never forget the mental anguish and fear they experienced during certain exams. Therefore, the mere mention of "examination" may cause them to "turn pale at the sight of a tiger."

But can examinations be completely abolished? Can examination methods be entirely eliminated from the school system or social institutions? This is probably impossible at present. Qing Shicheng said in his book "Secondary Education": "A child goes from primary school to junior high school to senior high school to university, unknowingly engaging in countless battles with the pen throughout their life. If a child lacks the ability to fight, their academic future is in danger." Indeed, anyone who has received a school education, whether in primary school, middle school, or university, still remembers the various examinations they have undergone, such as oral exams, written exams, quizzes, monthly exams, major exams, and graduation exams—truly a wide variety and diverse types.

After graduating from primary school, one must pass an entrance exam to enter middle school. After completing middle school, one must pass the graduation examination to graduate. After graduation, one must pass another entrance examination to enter university. After completing the university program, one must pass a comprehensive graduation examination to complete their university studies. After graduating from university, one sometimes needs to pass various examinations to find a job. It can be said that examinations have been very common in the past and present. In the course of our lifelong struggles, they occupy an important position and are a key factor in determining our academic and career success.

The purpose of this article is twofold: First, it will discuss the prevalence of examinations and then study and explain their functions, thereby affirming the value of their existence. Second, from the perspective of learning psychology, it will offer some concrete suggestions for preparing for examinations and the methods and skills of taking them, so that they can serve as a reference and help for young people seeking further education and graduates seeking jobs.

The Function of Examinations

Why do examinations occupy an important position in the course of our life's struggles? This is because examinations have several important functions for our academic and career success.

(1) From the teaching perspective, examinations allow teachers to quickly assess whether students understand and can apply the knowledge and skills they have learned. In individual teaching situations, the number of students taught by a teacher is very small, and they are very familiar with the level of each individual, so examinations may not be necessary. However, in today's classroom teaching, each classroom has forty or fifty students. No matter how experienced the teacher, it is difficult to accurately know the level of each individual. Therefore, the only way to do so is to use examinations, at the same time, giving the same questions, to test the performance of the students in the class. After understanding the students' performance, teachers can not only provide individual guidance based on the different levels and abilities of the students, but also discover the effectiveness of their own teaching based on the results of the examinations, and thus know how to seek improvement.

(2) From the student's perspective, examinations can provide students with a good learning opportunity and motivation. People are inherently lazy, especially students who lack self-control. Without proper motivation to urge them on, they are probably unwilling to learn automatically. Examinations can provide them with a good motivation to learn. Because to prepare for examinations, students must systematically review what they have learned on a regular basis. Through this systematic review, students can gain a systematic knowledge in a short period of time. This systematic knowledge helps them understand the interrelationships between different subjects. Moreover, students can know the results of their own work after taking the examinations. If their examination results are poor, they will have to work harder. If their examination results are excellent, they can increase their interest in learning. Therefore, examinations have the function of promoting students' efforts to learn.

(3) From the social perspective, examinations are still a relatively fair method of selecting talent. In ancient China, there was a system of "selecting scholars through imperial examinations." Examinations have been a method used to select talent for thousands of years. Later, because the methods and content of the imperial examinations were flawed, and the people in charge of the examinations were not suitable, various malpractices occurred and it was abolished. However, if we look at the modern European countries and Japan, the personnel employed by various government agencies still mostly use the civil service examination method. Even the government agencies and social groups in our country also mostly adopt the examination method to employ personnel. It can be seen that examinations are still a relatively fair method of selecting talent.

### Buying and Selling Halts, Public Bonds Hover

The public bond market continued to hover yesterday, and trading became increasingly light. In past years, trading was always light in the summer. This year, due to the talk of price controls, although it was not explicitly stated regarding public bonds, most buyers and sellers have therefore stopped. Currently, because there are still floating long and short positions in the market, offsetting transactions provide some embellishment. In the future, it may become even lighter, unless there are special circumstances. Yesterday's transactions included some selling by long positions and some covering by short positions. The market price fluctuated between three and five cents and remained within a hovering pattern. As a result, only "Consolidated was up by three cents, while B fell by a small amount of two cents.

### Piece Goods Gradually Feel Weak

Yesterday's cloth market gradually weakened, because actual sales were not smooth, people's sentiment was 又, and it was difficult to revive.

Peach Blossom Ladies' Forest opened at 288.5 yuan and fell to 282.5 yuan.

### Miscellaneous Grains Transactions Sporadic

The miscellaneous grains market did not show significant development yesterday. Only small retailers had sporadic transactions, providing some embellishment. The market was stable.

### Bran Destination Not Lonely

The bran market is weak in stock, but recent sales in nearby areas have not been lonely, so the market is bullish. Yesterday, 300 bags of Kai San Xin small-bag bran, warehouse receipts from May, were sold for 90.05 yuan.

### Cheap Cigarettes Repeatedly Urged to Ship

Cigarette prices are declining daily because actual sales are sluggish and existing goods are quite abundant. Cheap goods are like carp crossing the river, constantly emerging. Yesterday, delivery notices were repeatedly received, causing people's sentiment to become increasingly depressed, so prices continued to decline. Yesterday's opening prices included Great Britain brand at 8,600 yuan, Old Knife brand at 5,500 yuan, Pinhai brand at 4,700 yuan, Wuhua brand at 3,550 yuan, and Fairy brand at 3,750 yuan, all trending downwards.

Coarse sugar stock opened down by one yuan at 317.5 yuan. Midway, it fell another small amount of 2.5 yuan, reaching 315 yuan. Later, due to stimulating the appetite of incoming households, it slightly improved, closing at 316 yuan. A total of 1,200 bags were traded. The buying and selling prices of red sugar stock were more varied and no transactions occurred.

### Fish Maw Firm and Expensive

Fish maw is scarce because the source of foreign goods is exhausted and the number of Yong goods arriving is also small. Since goods are scarce, prices rise without inflation. Yesterday's market saw吊片 sold for 2,400 yuan, 王片 sold for 2,000 yuan, and 长胶 sold for 3,000 yuan. The stock of other goods such as 广肚 is gradually depleted, with no proper market and an upward trend.

### Xing Si Yuan Continues to Ease

With 化四圓, continuing shipments have arrived recently from Gulangyu and Shenjiamen, and the attitude of merchants has gradually relaxed, so prices have softened. Yesterday, there were dozens more pieces opened, a decrease of three to fifty yuan compared to before. Miscellaneous goods were relatively stable.

### Few Top-Grade Danshen

Danshen, a type of herb, was recently shipped from Anhui in more than a dozen pieces. Samples were seen yesterday, but because there were not many top-grade ones, only about 20%, the rest of the middle and lower grades were too thin to meet market demand. The bargained prices were still dozens of codes apart, so no transactions occurred.

### The Humble and the Sublime

— Xu Xizhen

Some people, when they see the ubiquitous street refugees, struggling to cling to the last moment of their lives under the cruel torment of hardship, hunger, displacement, and disease in this chaotic world, feel that at this time, there seems to be nothing cheaper than a person's life, and clinging to this lingering life in the mud seems to be a base act of seeking to survive; but others think that this kind of tenacious attachment to life, on the contrary, is a kind of supreme human sublimity. For me, I completely agree with the latter view.

Indeed, the hardships of current life often make good people feel that life is worse than death; when they are on the verge of material and spiritual collapse, they sometimes hope to get rid of this life. "Family suicides" and other events cannot be considered very rare at present. However, compared to those who drag their withered limbs on the streets, living one day at a time, I cannot help but feel that those who easily destroy themselves and easily "desert" their posts in the storms of life are often the base ones. Unconditional survival is indeed a disgrace, but making every effort to grasp the life that can be grasped, and prolonging life as much as possible without harming the good soul, it must be admitted that this is a kind of human sublimity. The strong attachment to life, enduring the temporary spasms of the times, and struggling to live on is always worthy of praise. There is no need to calculate what achievements our small individual has made in the overall life; the greatness of life is not calculated by the achievements of life. A soldier or police officer may not necessarily accomplish any feats while on duty, mostly it is peaceful and uneventful, standing until the end of their shift, and then retiring to let the next shift of people take over. And a good soldier or police officer, even in the heavy wind and rain, will never desert halfway because "there will be no practical benefit to this duty;" no, even if "there is no benefit" (he thinks), he will stand in the wind and rain until the last minute. Now, if we can compare the act of struggling to live in a chaotic world to an ordinary soldier guarding an ordinary post, then "until the last minute—" should be what we consider sublime—on the contrary, it is by no means base.

Chaplin used such a simple and powerful subtitle to end his film "Modern Times": "Cheer up, we have a long road ahead!"

### Quotes

— Zhang Ruizhen

Throughout history, men of great talent and ambition have all been trapped in adversity, enduring countless hardships and tireless efforts before achieving a great career. For adversity is like the bone-chilling winter wind, which can strengthen the body and consolidate the mind.

(Guan Luyin)

The warmth or coldness of human relations, and the success or failure of circumstances, change with time, as they always have. Only those who stand tall and independent can taste both sour and spicy, both hot and cold, maintaining a calm heart, without being swayed by joy or sorrow, experiencing constant change and chaos, and never altering their principles. (Tao Jue)

### Respite from the Summer Heat

— Wen Qu

The mercury in the thermometer continues to rise, the weather in the nineties is both hot and humid. Old Wang, the accountant at the dim sum shop, wearing a short shirt and trousers made of Xiangyun gauze, sits dozing at his desk.

The time is already half past six, and the sun outside is still so strong. There are few pedestrians on the street. It looks like only two or three customers will come this afternoon, making only ten dollars' worth of business. Business is unusually dismal.

Seeing this situation, Old Wang couldn't help but worry. He remembered what the boss said yesterday: "The hot weather means business is slow, expenses can't be covered, it's better to take a break for the summer!"

Hearing about the summer break, all the shop assistants were worried. There were at least two months of free time, half wages would be paid, lunch and dinner would no longer be provided, and there was no chance to earn extra money or pocket small sums.

Old Wang dozed for a while, then leaned back in his chair, silently. The waiter, A Fa, was also bored, so he came to chat with him.

"We can do some business in the evening," A Fa said.

"Now there's no market after ten o'clock. It only gets dark around eight o'clock. How many people can come to eat in such a short time!" This opinion was also what Old Wang heard the boss say yesterday.

"Yes, and because it's hot, many customers don't want to eat spring rolls, steamed buns... that kind of dim sum. We'd better change up the variety."

"You can't come up with new tricks for dim sum. I think it would be better to turn it into an ice shop, selling soda, shaved ice..."

"Mr. Wang, why don't you discuss it with the boss? That way, we don't have to take a summer break, and everyone will benefit."

Old Wang also thought A Fa's words were good. He decided to offer this suggestion to the boss when he came to settle the accounts in the evening. If it succeeded, it could save many shop assistants. It was already difficult to make a living relying on the dim sum shop, and if there was a summer break, life would be even harder to manage. Like Old Wang, there were several people with wives and children in the shop, who were even more worried than others.

In the evening, as soon as the boss sat down, Old Wang opened his mouth. He thought the boss would definitely approve of this wonderful plan.

"This is a good idea. Turning the dim sum shop into an ice shop isn't difficult, but it's too late. I've already rented the shop to someone else to temporarily open a mat shop, and we'll do business again when it gets cooler in the fall."

Old Wang's joy was dashed by the boss's few words. He felt even hotter and could hardly breathe. His forehead was covered in sweat.

"In short, the summer break is definite. Starting from the first day of the sixth lunar month, we'll temporarily close. The people in the shop can all go back to their hometowns and come back when it gets cooler in the fall. There's no place to live in the shop!"

"Come back in the fall..." Old Wang muttered, unable to answer.

### Thanks for the Scholarship

— A Struggling Student

The Shen Bao scholarship helped me finish my last year of middle school. Now, facing this diploma, I feel as if I have a thousand thoughts and want to express them all at once.

When my father was alive, I knew my fate was only to study until middle school, because my older brother followed my father to learn business after graduating from junior high school. I was fortunate enough to enter high school, and my father encouraged me: "You are smarter than your brother. Graduating from high school with a diploma will make it easier to find a job, but the cost is more than double that of junior high school!" However, it was more than double. Unfortunately, my father didn't live to see me graduate from middle school, passing away a year earlier. Naturally, for a family like ours, graduating from middle school is not easy. My father perhaps felt that my brother had some inconveniences when finding a job due to having studied fewer years, so he placed greater hopes on me, reluctantly letting me enter high school. But my father's efforts could not be realized, and it almost fell short due to not having the funds for the final year. If it weren't for the help of the Shen Bao scholarship, how could I have enjoyed my last year of study!

Now I have graduated, graduated from middle school, reaching the stage of my father's ideal. Although I don't know if finding a job will be as he imagined, I should deeply pay my respects to the Shen Bao and the enthusiastic people in society who helped me complete my studies!

However, many of my classmates are still studying arduously, and their goal is only to graduate from middle school. Therefore, hearing that this semester the Shen Bao scholarship is continuing its efforts despite rising tuition fees, and that the generous donations from people in society are still very enthusiastic, I am truly happy for them!

### Sharing the Boat Through Storms

— He Family Branch

(6) A Snap of the Fingers

Cui Zhen mentioned Guo Fang's health problems, and Wei Cheng also became worried, but he smiled and said, "It can't be. Guo Fang has a clever mind and a strong physique. Although the demon of illness may not know whether it has eyes or not, I think it can't bear to entangle Guo Fang." After saying these words, a day or two passed. Wei Cheng stretched his neck, looking east and then west, hoping that the green-clad messenger could deliver a letter, because the postman's route was from east to west; looking west, he hoped that Shuangqiao Town would send a special messenger, which would definitely be from west to east.

The result of looking was disappointment. The magpies, A Xing and others, were all wondering. These days, the young master seemed to be preoccupied. Seeing Wei Cheng stretching his neck, they nodded and smiled at each other. Seeing Ji Cheng put down his gaze from afar, afraid that the young master would see him watching him, he lowered his head and pretended that nothing was wrong. Only Cui Zhen knew what Wei Cheng was thinking. Seeing Wei Cheng in a daze, she smiled lightly and said, "Brother Cheng, there's still no news from Miss Chen." Wei Cheng replied awkwardly, "Sister Cui Zhen, I'm not expecting any news from Miss Chen. I'm watching a black cloud rising in the sky. In a while, I'm afraid there will be a rain shower." Cui Zhen didn't want to refute him further, saying, "Yes! Brother Cheng is used to living at home. He has learned all the farming experience of the villagers. After the rain shower, you'll be busy in the fields again tomorrow."

About ten days after leaving Wei Cheng for Shuangqiao Town, there was no news of Guo Qi or Guo Fang. Wei Cheng looked at the photos of Guo Fang and Cui Zhen hanging on the wall for a while. He thought, if he were an astrologer, he couldn't tell that Guo Fang would have a major disaster befall her. In the evening, Cui Zhen returned from the field, carrying a strong atmosphere of sunlight. Wei Cheng went up to meet her, removing her large bamboo hat. Cui Zhen hurriedly said that he shouldn't. Wei Cheng said, "Sister Cui Zhen, stand still. Let me see your face." Cui Zhen didn't know what he meant, standing under the steps, her hair disheveled, sweat still flowing from her forehead, not refusing to let Wei Cheng look at her. Wei Cheng said, "You seem a bit darker than in the previous photo." He only criticized this much, not asking anything else, and walked inside. Cui Zhen laughed, "What does this count for?" Wei Cheng said, "My purpose is to look at your face. There's nothing else."

### Regarding "Supporting Teachers"

— Ji Sheng

Some people advocate "cash support for teachers," which is originally a good method. However, because it is "cash," problems arise one after another, often leading to teachers' favoritism and grades being based on cash. "Cash support" seems to have become bribery. Although we try our best to call on teachers and students to pay attention to personality, how many people can see money and not be moved? If we talk about mutual supervision, it will inevitably create resentment between teachers and students, or create worse results.

Therefore, "cash support" must be considered. We certainly do not deny the poverty of teachers, nor can we "stop eating for fear of choking" and thus cancel "cash support." The important thing is the method of implementation.

Here, I offer an opinion, hoping to start a discussion and provide concrete methods.

The newspaper has a scholarship program. There should also be such an organization for supporting teachers. Students who wish to support teachers can pool their funds. Teachers can apply for support. Those who are confirmed to be impoverished can receive it.

In this way, teachers and students can avoid harboring evil thoughts towards each other, and the scope of support can extend to most teachers. If we launch it widely, the source of support will not be limited to students. Enthusiastic people can contribute as they wish, without any coercion. The meaning of support becomes much broader.

### Street Scene on a Summer Night

— Zhi Yin

It is already evening.

The heat wave inside the house is still terribly crowded. Although it is the first hot day since the beginning of summer, perhaps because we haven't been hit by a heat wave for months, it feels even more unbearably hot, as if a layer of oil has been added to the sticky heat. Therefore, I have to stand on that so-called balcony, regardless of the mud, rust, and garbage next to the iron railings.

The sky is terribly dark. The stars twinkle in some parts, but most of the sky is just a dark mass. Perhaps this shows the fate of tomorrow - the weather will probably be even more sultry!

The market is not as bustling as it was a year ago. At this time, wasn't it the middle stage of the night market? Looking across our porch, the familiar watermelon stall is also gone. Every year at this time, in addition to oranges, bananas, apples... and other displays on that watermelon stall, new seasonal goods should be added as usual, such as Zheng Guanghe soda, green bean orange juice, popsicles... but what remains in front of us is like a dark cave, with newly made wooden doors standing at the entrance of the alley where the stall used to be.

In the dimness, a red light seems to flicker in the distance, at the top of a wooden road kiosk; and there seems to be a lonely shadow pacing nearby, non-stop. I realize that this is the civil police, our self-defense team members on duty.

The burden of selling dried stinky tofu slowly goes away, along with its hoarse cries. It seems that there are few customers responding to him along the way. Looking at his difficult and staggering steps, I imagine that he is an elderly person.

Often, several silent rickshaws are pulled from the dark street, and sometimes, several bicycles with clean seats are ridden past. This is a recent novelty - the three-wheeled bicycle, which seems to be a means of transportation to replace cars lacking gasoline. At the same time, I really remember this time in the past: for a dollar, or only about five dollars last year, you could hire a car to drive around and enjoy the cool summer night breeze. But now, even if there are still such elegant people who use this new three-wheeled bicycle, enjoying the breeze is still the same, but the smell of sweat from the pedaling person that occasionally blows over is quite disappointing, and in terms of speed, there is inevitably a sense of the past and the present.

Again, a burst of gongs faintly drifts from afar. In the countryside, this should be the signal of a fire alarm; but based on my past experience, I know that it must be the old man performing magic tricks at a grassy wasteland at the triangular intersection, attracting his customers. But what makes me puzzled is that this kind of thing should only be done during the day. Why are there still so many onlookers on such a quiet night? But the continuous sound of gongs confirms that my guess is correct. This time, it must be when the old man is rushing to make the monkey jump. The sound of the gongs becomes tighter and tighter, and the old man's wrinkled and bitter face is even more clearly flashing before my eyes. I decided that this nighttime program is newly added. I also want to guess: Could it be that the price of rice is expensive again, and copper coins are even harder to get from the onlookers who love to watch the fun, and therefore they have started the night scene?

Because of the sound of gongs, this dim summer night in the silence appears even more vast and desolate!

The southwest wind blows intermittently, and the heat wave on my body fades a little. I remember that this is the summer night of this year, this cold and lonely street... A Record of Cooling Off.

A gentleman accompanied his wife to buy some cosmetics at a large company. After returning, he said with emotion, "If the money spent on cosmetics by all the ladies and misses in the city could be used for relief or charity, then at least the entire Shanghai could be without beggars."
