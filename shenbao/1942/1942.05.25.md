The battle situation is chaotic, with both sides claiming victory in their reports. The German side claims that the German army has managed to prevent the Red Army from reaching the outskirts of Kharkov. On the Soviet side, it is said that General Timoshenko has been intercepting German counterattacks in the Barvenkovo area. Street fighting has broken out in certain "important" locations, referring to what is likely Chuguev. The Soviet side claims that the Red Army has occupied a certain town southwest of Izyum, apparently Svyatogorsk.

Havas News Agency dispatch from Stockholm, 24th: Heavy fighting has been ongoing in the Kharkov area for twelve days. The situation appears to have stabilized, with conflicting claims of victory. According to the German side, the Soviet offensive is running out of steam, and the Red Army's 23rd Division has been decimated, with the German army conducting mopping-up operations. However, the Soviet side claims that the Red Army is consolidating its occupied positions in order to continue its offensive. According to neutral observers, there will be no dramatic developments in the area in the coming days, and it may even become a war of attrition.

Haitong News Agency dispatch from the German FÃ¼hrer's headquarters, 20-something: This afternoon's German war bulletin stated that after the German army launched a counteroffensive, elite Soviet forces were surrounded south of Kharkov and have repeatedly failed to break out.

Reuters dispatch from London, 24th: According to a Reuters correspondent in Moscow, German and Soviet forces are still fighting a desperate battle in the Kharkov area. Both sides are continuously reinforcing with large numbers of tanks, aircraft, and artillery. The German army is even deploying reserves originally intended for the decisive battle to the front lines. When German infantry are unable to breach the Soviet steel wall, they often use massive tanks, divided into teams of forty or sixty, to launch fierce assaults. According to Soviet Air Force reports, in a single day, they destroyed seventy-two German tanks, one hundred and fifty vehicles, and one thousand soldiers. However, German defenses remain extremely strong, especially the tank defense positions.

Haitong News Agency dispatch from Berlin, 24th: The German High Command issued a statement last night regarding the fighting in the Kharkov region on the Eastern Front, stating that the battle of Kharkov is extremely difficult, not only because of the intensity of the fighting, but also because of the hot weather. The temperature there has reached 30 degrees Celsius, which is unusual for this time of year. Soviet forces have been joining the battle with tank units for several days, but the strong German resistance has repelled all Soviet attacks. The German Air Force has been very successful in supporting ground operations. Due to the Soviet numerical superiority, they have achieved local victories, but German and allied counterattacks have ultimately driven the Soviets back. Although the details of Soviet losses in the battle of Kharkov have not been finalized, it is confirmed by all parties that the number of Soviet casualties during the offensive must be high. The German Air Force was very successful in supporting ground operations in the Kharkov area on Friday. When German aircraft bombed Soviet tank units, they destroyed seven tanks and three hundred vehicles of various types. Twenty-four Soviet heavy trucks loaded with gasoline caught fire after being hit.

Germany Gains the Initiative

Haitong News Agency dispatch from Berlin, 24th: The semi-official newspaper "Deutsche Nachrichten" summarized the battle of Kharkov yesterday as follows: The German war bulletin on Saturday released details of the battle of Kharkov, emphasizing the importance of the battle and the strength of the Soviet forces. The German war bulletin stated that the Soviet forces concentrated in the battle of Kharkov were very strong, proving that the Soviets had large-scale military objectives in this battle. According to official reports, the Soviet forces in the Kharkov area consisted of twenty infantry divisions, three cavalry divisions, and three tank brigades, a force even stronger than that on the Kerch Peninsula. Those responsible in Berlin conducted a detailed review of the situation in Kharkov, stating that the initiative there is now in the hands of the German army. The Soviet offensive, which began on May 12th, has completely failed. After repelling the Soviet offensive, the German army immediately launched a counteroffensive. On May 22nd, the German High Command announced that after gaining the initiative, the German army concentrated its counterattack, cutting off most of the Soviet rear lines of communication. The Soviet offensive plan was completely thwarted. Therefore, the second stage of the war in the area is a German mopping-up operation in the Kharkov area. Well-informed sources in Berlin say that the German operation is proceeding very smoothly. The counteroffensive launched by the German army after repelling the Soviet offensive is of considerable scale. However, the German offensive on the Eastern Front, which the world is watching, has not yet begun. However, after the German army accelerates its offensive, it may launch a general offensive on the Eastern Front.

### Axis POWs in the U.S. Treated According to International Convention; U.S. Denies Mistreating Japanese Residents

Havas News Agency dispatch from Washington, 23rd: The State Department has announced that the treatment of American prisoners of war by Japan, Germany, and Italy is as follows: American prisoners of war and confined American citizens in Japan are allowed to speak privately with neutral observers, although Japanese officers are sometimes present to monitor. None of the prisoners or confined citizens complained of any violations of the Geneva International Convention on Prisoners of War. Their rations are the same as those received by Japanese soldiers. Some prisoners are engaged in agricultural work and are paid. Confined citizens are either housed in camps, confined to their own homes, or allowed to move freely after taking an oath. Confined American citizens in Germany are housed in buildings with heating equipment, receive the same rations as German soldiers, and are allowed to see their families, communicate with the outside world, and receive food and clothing from outside. Most of those who are ill have been released, and those who remain are in good health. In Italy, American citizens are only confined to their own homes by the authorities. In short, the U.S. government intends to apply the Geneva Convention to enemy residents in the United States as much as possible, so that Americans in enemy countries can also fully benefit from the Convention. However, information on the situation of Americans confined in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Malaya, and the Dutch East Indies has not yet been received here.

Dispatch from Washington, 23rd: The State Department and the War Department today firmly denied reports that Japanese residents in the U.S. were being mistreated. Official sources pointed out that since the outbreak of the war, the Justice Department's first task has been to take several positive measures to protect the rights of foreigners, including residents of Axis countries. Axis diplomats were housed in hotels before returning to their countries and were not allowed to leave freely, but they lived comfortably under the protection of the U.S. government. Other Axis residents were also treated very well in all aspects. Some who had to relocate for military reasons were assisted by the U.S. government in finding new homes, and their standard of living was actually higher than before the war.

### Japanese Military Develops Malayan Minerals

Allied News Agency dispatch from Shonan City, 23rd: The Malayan Military Administration began to restore the development of Malaya's resources immediately after the Japanese army occupied Malaya, and work has progressed rapidly. Particular attention is paid to the development of minerals such as bauxite, tin, and iron, which are most needed during wartime. Mr. Okaguchi Ichigen, Chief of the Mining Section of the Ministry of Industry, spoke on the 23rd about the recent situation of mineral (iron and steel) development as follows: The purpose of the Japanese army in developing bauxite mines in Malaya and Loeh Island is to meet Japan's needs. Although the Pasir Panjang mine near Batu Pahat in the Malay Peninsula was almost completely destroyed by enemy forces, Ishihara Sangyo Co. is resuming operations after the Japanese army occupied the area. The current production has exceeded pre-war production. The Bukit Timah mine, about sixteen or seventeen miles from Pasir Panjang, was also destroyed by enemy forces, so it will take some time to restore its former appearance. A considerable amount of accumulated inventory there has now been moved out. There are also bauxite deposits near Malacca City, which were discovered after the Japanese army occupied the area and are now being developed. Although the mines are scattered throughout the area, the reserves are estimated to be about 3.5 million tons. Twenty technicians have been selected and are conducting surveys, and mining is expected to begin around November. There is also a bauxite mine on the south coast of Johor, which Ishihara Sangyo Co. of Japan had requested permission from the British government to develop before the war, but was rejected. The reserves are estimated to be about 15 million tons, which alone could supply Japan for several years. Also, because there are still a few landmines unexcavated in the dense forest area, they are being cleared and railways are being laid. It is expected that from this year to next year, all of Japan's steel needs will be supplied by this mine. Preparations are also being made for development. The Loeh Island mine was previously operated by the Dutch Wellington Tin Mining Company. The quality of the tin ore on the island is very good. Although the mine equipment was once destroyed, it was soon repaired by the Japanese and will be mined this month. In short, there is no shortage of bauxite ore. Once the machinery and other facilities are complete, large-scale production will be possible, and there will be no problem with the replenishment of ships. As for iron ore, the Sri Medan mine in Johor has been thoroughly destroyed. However, the Rengam mine in the same state, the Bukit Besi mine in Terengganu, the Maran mine in Pahang, and the Bukit Besi mine in Kelantan are still intact. The amount of ore and inventory being transported from Bukit Besi and Dungun is considerable and of excellent quality. The Penang tin smelting plant resumed operations on April 23. Although the generator at the Pulau Brani smelting plant in Shonan was destroyed, it is planned to temporarily close it down because the Pulau Loeh and Pangkal Pinang smelting plants are already in operation. Tin mines have been restored to their former state. The Tekka Tin Mine, the largest tin-producing area in Malaya, is also rapidly recovering and can produce several tons this month. Recently, it was decided to purchase Chinese ore at appropriate prices. The Bangka tin mine was previously operated directly by the Dutch government. When the enemy forces retreated, they took the generator. The Mentok and Pangkal Pinang smelting plants on the island have now been repaired. There are many tin mining areas on other islands, such as Wellington Island and Singkep Island. If they can all be mined, the supply will be excessive, so there will be a need to limit production in the future. In addition, the production of tin from Malaya and Sumatra will be operated by the Toyo Mining and Sunan Placer Mining companies. Coal production in Malaya has always been very weak. The Batu Arang mine in Kuala Lumpur is the only coal mine in Malaya. The coal produced is supplied to Malayan power plants and tin mine railways. The mine railway has also been damaged. After the Japanese army occupied the area, it entrusted Mitsubishi Mining to repair it. The current production is close to pre-war levels.

### Some U.S. Congressmen to Visit Britain

Havas News Agency dispatch from Washington, 22nd: Political figures here have said that some members of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives will soon travel to London to visit the British Parliament as a sign of strengthening the bond between the U.S. and Britain. However, the Republican Party has expressed opposition, believing that it is inappropriate for some members of Congress to visit Britain on the eve of the midterm elections. However, supporters believe that this trip will not only be beneficial to the union of the two great democracies, but also allow them to exchange views on the future peace organization, forcing the United States to actively participate in planning the post-war European organization. Whether the U.S. wants it or not, the U.S. will inevitably participate in the future peace conference and any post-war Allied conference. Therefore, after this war, the American isolationist faction will not be able to make a comeback.

The historical materials are all moving, and the envoys' perseverance and indomitable spirit are particularly inspiring. Now Father Xu has compiled these historical materials into an article titled "Ming Dynasty Envoy to the Roman Curia", which is specially published, along with a few words of introduction. - Editor

Since the Ming Yongli Empress Dowager had been baptized into the Church, she sent envoys to Macau to request Mass to thank the Lord for His grace, but she was still not satisfied. She wanted to send envoys to Rome again to pay homage to the Pope and report on her conversion to the Church.

Since the Empress Dowager had the intention of sending envoys to Rome, the question of personnel selection arose. Pang Tianshou's faith was strong, and he was very willing to go to pay homage to the Pope, so he requested to go. However, the Yongli Emperor believed that Duke Pang was old and weak, and that the court needed his assistance, so he did not allow his request, and said that it would be appropriate to choose one of the two priests, Qu Ande and Bu Mige, to go. Father Qu Ande had baptized the Empress Dowager and was familiar with matters in the palace. Father Bu Mige was a Pole, born in 1612, joined the Society of Jesus in 1629, arrived in Tokyo in 1645 to preach, and later went to Macau. He was sent to Zhaoqing in 1649. The two priests then consulted their superiors in Macau. After a meeting of the Macau superiors, Father Bu Mige was appointed to be the envoy. At that time, Father Bu was 38 years old, at the height of his abilities. Father Qu stayed in the Zhaoqing Imperial Palace. Pang Tianshou also appointed two Chinese youths to accompany Father Bu, one named Shen Ande and the other named Lu Ruose. Mr. Lu fell ill and returned halfway, while Mr. Shen accompanied him to Europe. He was 19 years old at the time. Both were dressed in Chinese clothes to show China's inherent culture.

Before Father Bu left, the Empress Dowager and Pang Tianshou each wrote four letters to the Pope and the General of the Society of Jesus. All four letters were in Chinese, translated into Latin by Fathers Qu and Bu. The original Chinese books are now preserved in the Vatican Library in Rome. According to Bo Xihe, there is only one letter to the Pope. As for the letter to the General of the Society, the Chinese version has not been seen, only the Latin translation is preserved. However, Mr. Zhang Jusheng of Shanghai previously brought back from Rome photographs of the "Edict of the Ming Empress Dowager to the Roman Pope", the "Letter of the Ming Empress Dowager to the General of the Society of Jesus", and the "Letter of Pang Tianshou to the Roman Pope". These were published in the fifth issue of the eighth volume of the "Eastern Magazine", so there are three preserved books. As for the appearance of the letters, according to Bishop Zhang Zhiliang of Jining, the Ming Empress Dowager's letter was written on yellow silk foil, with coiled dragons printed around it, like four frames, with flower borders outside the frames, and the colors were dazzling. The envelope was made of white silk, with red characters on it, the text of which was "Respectfully presented to Innocent, General Teacher of Jesus Christ on earth, Father of the True Lord." There was an outer letter tube, which was made of wood and covered with white silk, which was exquisitely beautiful. Pang Tianshou's report to the Pope had the character "Respectfully" on the front, with a square pearl seal, the seal text of which was "Seal of the General Governor of Brave Guards". The report was written on red folded paper. In order to express his gratitude for being baptized by the Jesuits, Pang Gong specially dedicated a silver plate to the tomb of St. Ignatius, engraved with Chinese and Latin.

The letters to Rome were written and completed, and then, during Mass, Pang Tianshou respectfully presented them to Father Bu. In November 1650, Father Bu and the two youths left Zhaoqing and went up the river to Macau. After Father Bu arrived in Macau, he handled all the envoy procedures. Unexpectedly, the Portuguese government in Macau raised many obstacles, believing that the Ming Dynasty's isolated regime could not last long, and that the Qing Dynasty would be unfavorable to itself in the future. However, Father Bu was able to depart on January 1, 1651. He arrived in Goa in May of the same year. The Portuguese government in Goa added even more obstacles to Father Bu, refusing to let him go. After half a year of negotiations, he could not get anywhere. Father Bu then abandoned his plan to sail and secretly traveled by land, through India, Persia, Armenia, Asia Minor, and reached Smyrna. He changed to a Venetian ship and arrived in Venice in early December 1652. The Venetian Republican government forbade Father Bu from entering the country. After mediation by the French envoy to Venice, he was allowed to enter, and he was treated favorably by the Senate. The Venetian government received Father Bu with the etiquette of a Chinese envoy, and Mr. Shen was his aide-de-camp. This can be said to be an international exchange between the Chinese court and the European Republic of Venice. The General of the Society of Jesus in Rome was quite displeased when he heard that Father Bu, as a member of the Society, was serving as this envoy. After Father Bu reported the details, he was allowed to enter Rome in a private capacity. Unexpectedly, after Father Bu arrived in Rome in 1653, some members of the clergy who were hostile to Father Bu claimed that he was impersonating an envoy and sneaking into Rome, and that the position of envoy was purely a fabrication of the Society of Jesus. Therefore, many difficulties arose regarding Father Bu's personal qualifications and the envoy's mission. The Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith met three times, and only resolved that the Pope could reply to the Ming Empress Dowager's national letter. While these trivial matters were happening, Pope Innocent X passed away in 1655, and the new Pope Alexander VII took office. Therefore, the Pope's reply was only issued on December 18, 1655, a total of two letters, one to the Empress Dowager and one to Pang Tianshou.

After obtaining the reply letter, Father Bu went to Lisbon, Portugal, and boarded a ship to return to China on March 30, 1656. Eight other members of the Society accompanied him, including Fathers Bai Yingli and Lu Zhiman. He arrived in Goa on November 6 of the same year. At that time, the Dutch blockaded Goa, and the members of the Society dispersed. Father Bu endured many hardships and arrived in Siam in early 1658. He planned to go to Macau, but because the Qing Dynasty had already taken over China, he could not go. He changed to a Chinese ship, sailed by a Dutchman, and arrived in Hanoi, Annam, in June. He waited until February 16, 1659, to set up a French Guangxi, but the Manchu army guarded it strictly, and he could not take a step forward. At this time, Father Bu was mentally and physically exhausted, and eventually fell ill. He died on August 22, 1659, on the border between Hanoi and Guangxi. His companion Shen Ande buried him and erected a stone tablet and a cross. Mr. Shen then fled into the mountains to avoid the Manchu Qing's pursuit, and the Pope's reply letter that Father Bu brought back could not be presented to the Ming court.

In the many years since Father Bu left China and returned to China, many changes had taken place in China. Father Qu Ande followed Yongli as he fled east and west, without a day of peace. One day, while taking a boat to avoid the Manchu army's pursuit, he was unfortunately captured. The Manchus questioned him in detail. Father Qu made the sign of the cross and recited the phrase, "By the holy cross, save us from our enemies" in response. Two Manchus then split his head with an ax, also in the shape of a cross, dividing it into four pieces. Another said that Father Qu followed Yongli and was captured by the Qing soldiers in a certain river in Guangxi, put to death, and his body was thrown into the river. It is also said that Father Qu was killed by the Qing soldiers, and Pang Tianshou buried him with due rites. As for the year of his death, there are different opinions, one saying it was in 1663, another saying it was in 1662, or 1658.

Pang Tianchou, who was loyal to Yongli, also died before Father Bu. At the time of his death, there was no priest by his side to administer the sacraments, but he was zealous in serving the Lord during his life and died peacefully. As for the year of his death, some say it was in 1658, others say it was in 16855, or 16 years, with different legends.

The Empress Dowager passed away in May after Father Bu set off, on May 10, 1651. The "Xiaodian Chronicle" says: In the fourth month of Yongli's fifth year, the Ming Empress Dowager died in Tianzhou, and was buried in Nanning in May, with the posthumous title of "Empress Xiaozhuang Yikang". However, Western history says that the Empress Dowager was captured from Burma by Wu Sangui and died in Yunnan in 1662. After her death, Yongli did not allow any non-religious rites to be held.

The last years of Emperor Yongli were even more tragic. The emperor went to Guangxi, then Yunnan, then Burma. The King of Burma greeted him with four boats and sent him to the capital city of Ava, where he lived for one year and six months. More than 1,500 of his entourage were lost. In the twelfth month of Yongli's fifteenth year, the Ming traitor General Wu Sangui went deep into the city of Ava. The King of Burma was terrified and hastily presented Yongli and his royal family to the army. In the fourth month of the following year, Yongli was killed in Yunnan. His son, Duke Si Changding, was fifteen years old at the time, and was killed at the same time. Empress Ma, Maria, and Empress Wang, Anna, and several other palace women were sent to Beijing, where they lived in separate palaces and were forbidden to go out, but the treatment was still good. However, the Ming Empresses and others were not allowed to see the priests in Beijing or receive the sacraments. Fortunately, some female Catholic friends went to inquire and comfort them with religious principles, which was also a consolation in the midst of suffering. The above is all recorded in Western history.

Recently, P. Schrestter, a priest in Nanlong, Guizhou, published an article in the Bulletin Catholique de Peking, 1915, PP, 266.267, stating that the tombs of Yongli and his son were discovered in Nanlong County in 1915. This tomb had been excavated by rebel soldiers before 1850 to steal treasures, but nothing was found. Now there are only two piles of soil, and no one can suspect that they are imperial tombs.

The "Xiaodian Chronicle" vividly describes Wu Sangui's capture and killing of Yongli. The last days of the King of Gui were extremely tragic. At this point, the Ming Dynasty's isolated regime came to an end.

### First Batch of Citizen Certificates Available This Week

After the Public Concession Police Department's Baojia Department abolished the office that specialized in handling the exchange of citizen certificates, the application forms that had been sent to the department, along with the completed citizen certificates, have been sent back to the various police stations' Baojia departments for direct completion and issuance. The first batch of seven or eight thousand certificates can be issued by the original applying police station next week. The application forms for the Laoza District are also being collected, so the issuance of citizen certificates can be accelerated and issued continuously.

Return Home Certificate

The Return Home Special Pass Office of the Public Works Department on Jiangxi Road is continuing to issue return home certificates. Other sub-offices are also accepting applications as usual. Various Shanghai hometown associations and travel agencies are also entrusted to act as agents for issuing certificates. The total number issued daily is around 10,000, which is quite a large number.

Temporary Certificate

The Temporary Pass Office also issues mixed certificates. The number of applicants is even greater, because in addition to being able to use the certificate to pass through the surrounding areas of Shanghai to return home, it can also be used to return to Shanghai. Because the number of people is too crowded, the certificate issuing office issues them in several batches each day to alleviate the excessive congestion.

### Allied Banks Allow Withdrawal of Deposits: Most Have Not Withdrawn

After several Allied banks in this port have successively resumed withdrawals and deposits, there are still many depositors who have not gone to their relevant banks to withdraw the funds they are allowed to withdraw. For example, the British-owned Mercantile Bank of India recently issued a formal announcement urging depositors who have not yet withdrawn funds to do so as soon as possible. According to the Mercantile Bank of India, it has started processing the first withdrawal of 2,000 yuan from the 4th of this month. Neutral country depositors can withdraw all at once, while Allied country depositors are limited to withdrawing 500 yuan per week until the withdrawal is complete. According to inquiries made by reporters to Chase Bank yesterday, the bank has started processing three withdrawals from the 15th of this month, and many depositors with funds available for withdrawal have not gone to the bank to withdraw them. As for the amount of the bank's three withdrawals, it is 10% of the balance after deducting 2,000 yuan from the balance on December 6 last year. It is heard that the phenomenon of depositors withdrawing money has not been crowded in the past week. In addition, HSBC, Mercantile Bank, and Citibank are still continuing to pay their third batch of withdrawals. The withdrawal percentage is 25% for HSBC and 30% for Mercantile Bank and Citibank.

He was seriously injured and died at Tongren Hospital.

### The New Bureau of Works Organization for Solving All Problems (6) 3. Rent Dispute Mediation Committee

Another Proclamation

On March 28th, the Bureau issued another important proclamation. It stated that landlords may not force tenants who are unable to pay rent due to financial difficulties to move out without the consent of the Mediation Committee. One particularly important point is that all rent increases prior to further notice will not be effective unless approved by the Committee.

Since the Mediation Committee was established in mid-January, it has proven its benefit to society. In total, there have been seventy-four cases. Tenants accounted for forty-one cases, and landlords only thirty-three. Of these, fifty-three have been resolved. Twenty-five cases were settled, seven withdrawn, and twenty were not accepted. Twenty-one cases are currently still pending.

The actual handling procedure of such cases will be briefly explained by a member of the Committee specializing in legal affairs as follows: After receiving a complaint, the Committee forwards a copy to the other party and requires them to respond within three days. Upon receiving the response, a Bureau staff member convenes both parties to try to mediate a settlement. This is just a conversation to find out the real cause of their dispute. In eight out of ten cases, it is only about minor matters, and the matter is thus peacefully resolved.

"If a settlement is impossible," said the legal affairs member, "we try to get them to sign a letter of authorization, stating that they agree to submit the case to us for mediation and abide by our judgment. After the letter of authorization is signed, the case is presented to the entire Committee, awaiting its decision."

"Deepest Apologies"

"So, if the landlord and tenant are unwilling to sign a letter of authorization?" he continued, "we tell them we deeply apologize, but we are powerlessâ¦ In other words, we cannot usurp the authority of the court. This situation is rare."

"In a few cases, when they come to see us, the case has already been, or will be, heard by the court, and the Mediation Committee is powerless to intervene," said the Committee member. "Moreover, both parties must agree to our handling of the matter. Once a judgment is made by the Committee, it will undoubtedly be supported by any court."

The Mediation Committee strives to be cautious, so as not to favor either party. There is no fairer or more reasonable method than this. Regarding the handling of rental issues, the Committee's usual standard is to allow landlords to double the rent based on the assessed value in 1937.

Here is an example

Here is an example of many cases. A landlord received a monthly rent of 381 yuan from his tenant, which included the provision of heating and hot water. After the lease expired, the rent remained unchanged, but the landlord demanded an additional 50 yuan for hot water. The tenant objected, so the matter was brought to the Mediation Committee. The Committee studied the case and found that the assessed rent for the premises in 1937 was only 129.65 yuan. Therefore, not only did the Committee disapprove of the landlord's request for additional hot water fees, but it also decided to reduce the rent to 300 yuan. The landlord had no choice but to comply.

One thing is very interesting: most of the cases are Chinese. They are very willing to come to the Mediation Committee. The court also prefers them to do so. Therefore, they are constantly flocking to the Bureau of Works Rent Dispute Mediation Committee, landlords and tenants, owners and renters, two by twoâ¦ They all come out smiling slightly. It is a pity that not everything in life can be resolved so amicably.

### Speculators Are Stirring Up Trouble; French Authorities Decide to Punish Severely; Current Living Situation is Extremely Difficult; Determined to Do Everything Possible for the Welfare of the Citizens

In recent months, the French Municipal Police Department, in order to protect the public, has taken extremely severe measures against speculation, manipulation, and excessive profits. If these indispensable measures are not strictly enforced, the current difficult living situation (difficulty in purchasing currency and food, lack of ships, etc.), which is already difficult to control, will be even more unimaginable.

Determination to Cope with Difficult Times

Countless speculators, due to the severe punishments, have lost the illegal profits they had planned to obtain, and are now stirring up trouble, using various improper methods to go against the police authorities. In fact, they are wasting their time. The French Municipal Police Department is determined to continue to severely punish acts detrimental to the public withoutææ . In the past, the city's living conditions were better than other cities similarly affected by the war because of the cooperation of various authorities in coping with difficult times. These jointly adopted measures should naturally be continued. In the past six months, the French Concession Police Department has been using its full strength to seek welfare for the residents of the city in response to the needs of the Concession and the urgent demands of the Japanese authorities, etc. In addition to efforts to reduce criminal cases, such as requisitioning necessities, registering all resources in the Concession, and investigating household registration, there is no end to it.

Police Extortion Can Be Reported

Recently, it is planning to organize Baojia, organize civilian police groups, issue 600,000 ID cards, and cooperate with other authorities to improve the distribution of rice, so as to avoid queuing and crowding in front of rice shops. The staff of the department are doing their best to cope with the difficult work. In the above process, some people inevitably impersonate detectives to engage in extortion, but those people are arrested and tried. Moreover, events of abuse of power also occur from time to time, but if this matter is formally reported to the detective authorities, and after investigation, it is found to be true, severe punishments are quickly given. The detective department has always adopted this measure, and now it continues to do so tirelessly. This can be guaranteed to the public by the French Consul-General Faber. The duties of the detectives and patrolmen of the detective department are originally boring and tasteless. For the need to maintain law and order, the actions of the detective department are sometimes regarded as unpleasant on the surface, but the people must know that the personnel of the detective department from top to bottom all take protecting the people as their own responsibility, and everyone gives their lives to achieve this goal. This situation has been common in the past few years.

### Price Limits on Food in the French Concession (May 23rd to May 27th)

### Changshan Steamer Carries a Batch of Coffins to Ningbo

The matter of transferring the coffins of fellow villagers back to their hometowns, handled by the Siming Public Association Guohua Funeral Home, has been in preparation for many days. At the beginning of the month, an advertisement was published in the newspaper to inform all fellow villagers. People from various counties under Ningbo who wish to transfer their coffins back to their hometowns can request registration from the Guohua Funeral Home or the Siming Public Association. In the past two weeks, the number of registrants has been quite crowded. It is now reported that it has been decided to entrust the Changshan steamer to carry the first batch on the 27th of this month. It is reported that there are 30 coffins. The transportation cost is reported to be 26 yuan in Japanese military notes for water freight and 100 yuan for other loading and unloading labor. Also, the Siming Public Association's summerãaffairs meeting resolved toè£è¿ 500 coffins of long-termèµæ back to their hometowns for burial. According to the person in charge of the association, the date ofè£è¿ is still difficult to determine at present, and its nature is fundamentally different from theè¿æ©è¿ç± handled by the association together with the Guohua Funeral Home.éª¸ Those who are selected from the institute willåè´¹è¿ç±å®è¬ long-termèµæ, purely to help poor fellow villagers.

### Opening of the German Painting and Woodcut Exhibition

The German Painting and Woodcut Exhibition opened yesterday (23rd) at 3:00 pm at No. 7 Daxilu. The exhibited works include paintings and woodcuts. The paintings are divided into classical paintings, romantic paintings, naturalist paintings, impressionist paintings, modern paintings, and portraits of German great men. The woodcuts are divided into works by ancient sculptors, modern woodcuts, and practical woodcuts. There are so many beautiful things that one can't take them all in. Among them, the classical paintings mostly focus on religious themes, such as the birth of Christ, Jesus' first visit to the temple, Christ and his parents. Modern paintings reflect the characteristics of urban life and the German national character quite obviously. The images of great men such as Hitler and other ancient German great men such as Martin Luther and Goethe are all lifelike and full of spirit. Other landscapes, flowers and birds are mostly harmonious in color and particularly vivid and beautiful. Although it rained yesterday, art lovers still came in an endless stream to visit, hoping not to miss this opportunity to appreciate German art.

### Disagreement Between the Combatant Nations Regarding the Exchange of Evacuees; The US and UK Believe That Neutral Vessels Should be Used; Vessels of Combatant Nations Should Not Assume This Responsibility

In recent days, it has been widely rumored among the British and American expatriate communities that the reason for the delay in making a concrete decision on the exchange of nationals between Japan and the United Kingdom and the United States is that the relevant authorities have not yet reached a consensus on the issue of the nationality of the transporting vessels.

The Vessel Issue

The US and UK governments believe that the evacuation of British and American officials and ordinary people from Japan and its occupied territories to designated exchange locations should be carried out by neutral vessels, while the Japanese authorities have announced that British and American officials and civilians will be transported to East Africa by a total of four vessels, including the Italian postal ship Conte Verde and the Japanese postal ships Tatsuta Maru, Asama Maru, and Kamakura Maru. This point may not be agreed to by the British and American authorities. The negotiations between the relevant authorities are now apparently focused on this point. According to a British official currently staying in Shanghai, "Since the negotiation on the exchange of nationals, the importance of the issue of neutral vessels has never been greater than it is today." According to some people, if such a point of contention cannot be resolved satisfactorily, the evacuation of nationals cannot be expected to proceed smoothly.

Conflicting Opinions

The negotiations between Japan and the United Kingdom and the United States for the exchange and evacuation of officials and civilians have been ongoing for two months. When it was first announced, it was said that two Brazilian ships would sail from South America to Shanghai to welcome and transport the nationals of the Allied countries back to their countries. Soon, the Japanese authorities announced that the exchange of officials and civilians would take place in Magus, East Africa. Later, it was revealed that the officials and civilians of the Allied countries would be transported from here separately by Italian and Japanese postal ships. However, the spokesman of the Japanese Embassy stated a few days ago that this matter cannot be determined until the last minute, and the Italian authorities did not confirm that the Conte Verde would be one of the dedicated ships for the evacuation of nationals. Unexpectedly, today, the issue of the nationality of the ships has caused a clash of opinions, which makes the prospects for the evacuation of nationals less optimistic.

### The Yoyoyo Nursery; The Fundraising Extension Ends; Continuing to Provide Vegetable and Nutrition Charts

The Yoyoyo Nursery was reorganized from the Gonghua Children's Shelter, and it has 250 children, all of whom areé¾ç«¥ who have been displaced by the war,å­¤è¦æ ä¾ and whose situation is particularly pitiful. Last month, it held a fundraising campaign, which was originally scheduled for one month. The achievements have exceeded 100,000. It has now been decided to extend the period to June 6th. In addition, the Production Department of theé¢ has specially set up a rattan craft sales outlet at No. 544 Xinzha Road (west end of Chengdu Road). All kinds ofç±å¶å¨å· are available, and a 10% discount is offered at the beginning of the opening.

Those who wish to claim a copy can attach a four-point postage stamp and send a letter to No. 9, Lane 110, Kaifeng Road (telephone 43176) to claim it.

### The Chinese Children's Welfare Association; Raising Educational Expenses; Target of 200,000 Legal Tender

The Chinese Children's Welfare Association in this city has always taken promoting children's happiness as its mission. Since the outbreak of the war, people have been displaced, and the old and young have been separated. The association's responsibilities lie in striving for relief work. It has successively sheltered nearly 10,000é¾ç«¥. There are now two locations: theæå¹¼æé¤é¢ and theé¾ç«¥æ¶å®¹æ, which shelter a total of more than 450å­¤è¦ children who have nowhere to go. At this time when everything is expensive, the funding has increased several times. Although it is trying to be thrifty, it is often insufficient. Therefore, the association's executive committee has decided to hold a fundraising campaign for educational expenses from June 1st to June 31st, with a target of one hundred thousand yuan in legal tender. Theå¹¹äºé¨ is now actively preparing for it. It is deeply believed that people from all walks of life will definitelyè¸è·æè¾ at that time, so that the association's work will not be abandoned due to lack of funding. Then the benefit to children will be boundless.

### A Traveler Died in a Rickshaw

At 1:00 pm the day before yesterday, an unnamed man resembling a worker, about 40 years old, came to Shanghai by train from another port due to illness, intending to go to Xinkaihe to take a boat back to his hometown. Unexpectedly, he hired a rickshaw and died in the car while passing through Laobeimen Street in the French Concession. The rickshaw pulleræ reported it to the detective department, and the body was carried into the é¨å°¸æ. Since noå°¸å± was found, the body was æ®å by theåå  and waited for theå± to claim it.

### Qianghua vs. Zhou Tang Small Ball Match; Today's Showdown at Donghua Stadium; No Tickets Sold; Welcome to Watch

The Qianghua football team, whichè¿å¾æ²ªå, arrived in Shanghai yesterday (22nd).

### Struggling for Survival; The Jewish Street Market; Determined, Calm, Alert, and Adventurous Are Their Unique Characteristics

Special Report by This Newspaper

I remember someone once telling a joke that mocked the Jews: "A certain wealthy man behaved lavishly and spent money like dirt. Once, while traveling in the Jewish country, he unfortunately fell ill. According to the doctor, he had to receive a blood transfusion to be saved. This wealthy man was willing to pay a thousand gold in exchange for someone to sell his blood. At that time, a Jew responded and was willing to transfuse his precious blood to the wealthy man and get this reward. Unexpectedly, after the wealthy patient received the blood transfusion, he completely went back on his word and only agreed to pay half of the reward. Later, the wealthy man bought blood from the Jew several times, but the price he was willing to pay decreased each timeâ¦"

Skilled in Financial Management

The storyteller asked here, "Why did a wealthy man who spends money like dirt suddenly become so stingy?" The answer is that this wealthy man had a lot of Jewish blood in his body. The Jews are known for their stinginess, and the wealthy man was poisoned by the stinginess of the Jews. Although this joke is inevitably too exaggerated and too mocking, it partially shows a characteristic of the Jewish people. The Jews are not only stingy but also extremely diligent and thrifty. In fact, stinginess and thrift are twins. Stingy people must be diligent and thrifty, and diligent and thrifty people must also be stingy. Because of this, the Jews are good at financial management and business. Isn't Hartung, whose estate dispute still has no hope of being resolved, a Jew?

However, hidden behind the Jewish people's diligent, thrifty, and stingy national character are their determined, calm, and alert ability to adapt to and create environments. You must know that the Jews now have no motherland. Their footprints are all over the world, but they have the courage to take risks and be enterprising. No matter how dangerous the environment is, no matter how much they are bullied and persecuted, they always maintain their determination and perseverance to fight for the right to survive. This is why they can still achieve a considerable position in this world of survival of the fittest.

Penetrating Everywhere in Selling Goods

I'm afraid no one would firmly believe that there are tens of thousands of Jews in Shanghai! In recent years, batches of Jewish people have been expelled from Europe and came to this international city of Shanghai as displaced refugees. They originally lived in countries such as Germany and Austria, developing their inherent national character, occupying a very priority position in the financial, industrial, and commercial circles, and even in the political circles. Unfortunately, they suffered from the jealousy of the local government, sufferingç£¨é¾ and devastation, until their families were destroyed and they were left with nothing, and they were expelled from the country. After arriving in Shanghai empty-handed and wandering, they settled down in the Hongkou area,éæ°å¼ èµ· the banner of survival, and embarked on a difficult road of struggle.

I have just said that the Jews are good at business, so their livelihood skills cannot escape the scope of commerce. In the office buildings in the central area, there are often Jews coming in and out. They are salesmen of goods, carrying a briefcase or basket, selling door to door. They can indeed grasp the threshold of doing business, softly and kindly asking people to buy this and buy that. They understand the customers' minds very well, but they also maintain their dignity. Tidy clothes and a particularly kind attitude often leave a deep impression. (To be continued)

### Jewish Merchants

Jews are known for their business acumen in the world. After the peopleæµäº¡ to Shanghai, they worked hard and struggled hard, and finally gained a foothold. The picture on the right (top) is the Mazhong Road market in Zhongxin District (bottom) The demeanor during the transaction.

### Opportunity to Buy is Profit; Yarn and Cloth Jump Horizontally

â Quan

Last week, the yarn and cloth market was completely chaotic due to the repeated listing of Central Reserve Certificates and the exchange of various rumors. At the end of the week, the market atmosphere was likeææµªéªæ¶, and the changes were incomprehensible. In addition, eight yarn factories in Shanghai, including ShenxinãNine, Yongan Third, Baofeng, Anda, and Hefeng, were implementing the return of the factories, which made people even more excited. The 20-count Double Horse factoryå broke through three major levels of 7,000, 8,000, and 9,000 yuan from the previous week's 6,000 yuan. Theç°è´§ of more than 1,000 that wasè½§å¼ daily was graduallyè¶è½§æ¢ due to the influence of the factory single that could beè½¦è´§, so the price continued to rise. The highest price for 10-count Double Horse factoryå was actually 9,100 yuan, and theç°è´§ was 9,400 yuan. Coarse and fine cloth also unanimously set new highs. 16-pound Double Elephant coarse cloth was 370 yuan, and 12-pound Earth fine cloth was 330 yuan,åä¸º a peak that has never been seen before.

On Monday, due to the inverted salesç in the inland, many people wanted toåå®, and Double Horse once fell back, down to 5,870 yuan; but the factory cloth was ä¸ç, jumping horizontally and rising on its own. After Tuesday, theå¹»å became even greater; high prices were emerging one after another, and theæ¶¨é£ often occurred after the close. Taking the cotton yarn factoryå as an example: the closing price on Tuesday was 6,120 yuan, but after the close, it rose again to 6,400 yuan; the closing price on Wednesday was 6,330 yuan, but after the close, it did again to 6,700 yuan; again, the closing price on Thursday was 7,200 yuan, but outside theå¡², it did again to 7,820 yuan; even the closing price on Friday was 8,000 yuan, but after the close,ç¶æ¶¨ to 8,700 yuan. Such a situation is simplyç½è¦©. The reason is that it is actually a åå¨ of the financial stimulus. At the weekend, the closing price of 10-count Double Horse factoryå was 8,850 yuan, a sharp increase of 2,760 yuan from the previous week, and theç°è´§ was 9,430 yuan, an increase of 1,830 yuan. 20-count Double Earth was 9,200 yuan, an increase of 2,050 yuan; 32-count Jin Bao Xing was 13,200 yuan, an increase of 2,250 yuan. 16-pound Double Elephant coarse cloth was 370 yuan, an increase of 90 yuan; 12-pound Earth coarse cloth was 330 yuan, an increase of 93 yuan.

At present, the actual sale of yarn and cloth is stillåé¡¿, and the retail business on this street is also limited due to the weak purchasing power. However, due to the continuous financial stimulus, it has caused aææ· åå. At present, people's hearts are showing a chaotic atmosphere due to the vestiges of last week's bigä¸è½. How will theå¹»å be next week? It should still beå·¦å³ by theéè¡ of the financial market.

### Ultimately Full of Concerns: Foreign Stocks Still Rising

â Sang

During the past week, the foreign stock market initially showed signs of stability mixed with fatigue, making it difficult to rally. Supply and demand were normal. However, after Wednesday, there was a sudden and sharp surge. This upward trend continued. It seems that attention was initially focused on hoarding cotton yarn and military scrip. Later, realizing that their market prices had risen excessively, people suddenly turned their attention to foreign stocks that had not yet been driven up. They all rushed to buy them, a phenomenon of flocking. The total trading volume for the week increased rapidly along with the rising prices, reaching 358,110 shares in five days. (According to daily reports from the Chinese Brokers Association.) The last day saw the highest volume, with 138,275 shares, breaking the record since December 8th of last year. This was likely also caused by the recent currency system changes.

Among various stocks, textile stocks continued to be the most traded and active. Ewo Cotton Mill initially fluctuated between $38.50 and $39.50, but by Wednesday, it suddenly soared to $43.75, eventually closing at $43, a rise of $3.50. Bank of China saw a low of $23.75, then surged all the way to $30.50, a rise of $6.25. Sincere Cotton Mill rose from $18.50 to $26.20, a rise of $7.70. These were all driven by the surge in yarn prices. Small-cap stocks saw weaker gains. Paper stocks rose $10 to $12.10. Shanghai Woolens rose only $0.30 to $17. Rubber stocks saw relatively active trading, with Dunlop, Galongdan, and Tanah Merah seeing the most transactions. However, the price increases were minimal, rising by about $0.36. Among industrial stocks, only Yap Guang saw a significant increase of $6.25; the others saw limited gains. Daily trading volume was low. Financial stocks were even more neglected, with only Sino-Foreign slightly improving. Among public utility stocks, only trams saw active trading; the rest lacked sellers.

Considering the ever-increasing commodity prices, foreign stock trading is no longer determined by safety or business conditions. Instead, it is based solely on the asset value for valuation. However, observing the trend of large amounts of speculative funds, it seems that they have not yet concentrated here. Therefore, the upward pressure cannot compete with other assets. This is ultimately due to the many concerns about the future.

### Chinese Stocks Soar: Financial Stimulus Frequent, Growth Breaks Records

The Chinese stock market experienced a dramatic change due to financial upheaval. Intense buying pressure and soaring prices created a new situation where there was demand for stocks but no supply. This phenomenon was unprecedented and could be seen as a reflection of public panic, rather than enthusiastic investment.

Looking at the stock market over the past week, the beginning of the week continued the upward trend from the previous week, with prices tightening step by step. Since the listing of old and new legal tender on Wednesday, after three successive reductions from 77, the upward trend suddenly intensified. Buyers seeking to enter the market rose like wind and clouds. The tense mood was indescribable. China Underwear, a department store stock, rose from $25.50 to $34.50. Wing On Company rose from $64.50 to $72.50. The Sincere Company rose from $74 to $80. New pharmaceutical stocks were particularly prominent. New Asia New Stock broke through the $40 mark on Thursday and soared to $44.50. Sino-French New Stock initially showed stability, then suddenly surged to a high of $76, with strong momentum still present. Sheng Hua Preference saw a sudden surge, rising from $22.50 to approximately $31. Sino-British Dispensary had already risen to $190 per share. Other stocks such as Wu Zhou, Min Yi, and Xin Yi were all very popular. Textile stocks had limited shares, and the upward trend was even stronger after being stimulated by the market. Da Sheng Mill rose from $55 to $100. The Third Mill rose $45. Da Feng Dyeing and Weaving rose $55. Among industrial stocks, cultural stocks saw the strongest gains. World New Stock even reached a peak of $110. Commercial Press and China Book Company also rose frequently. Art Forest Color Printing rose from $85 to $107.50. The rise of Great China Match was not much because its face value had already exceeded six times. New Capital Hotel initially rose, then remained stable. Public utility stocks, such as China Electricity, broke through the $20 mark and stood between $21 and $21.50. Zhabei Water and Electricity was also approaching $20.

Looking ahead to this week's market, if the financial trend does not stabilize from the volatility, then the continued rise of the stock market is almost certain. However, it is worth noting that after last week's surge, sellers have become scarce, and buyers have adopted a wait-and-see attitude due to the high prices. Therefore, it is predicted that the trading volume this week will be difficult to match last week's prosperity.

### Favorable Environmental Changes: Bond Market Improves

â Ling

The public bond market saw heated battles between buyers and sellers, with extremely drastic changes. The sudden shift from limit down to limit up was a rare feat not seen since December 8th of last year. Although sellers dumped a lot of bonds at the end, the buyers relied on their unlimited capital to absorb them without releasing them. With the assistance of the environment, they were able to recover from a near-death situation, eventually rising by $0.90 to $4.20. The total trading volume for the week was strong, totaling approximately 13 million dollars.

On Monday and Tuesday, the entire situation was almost controlled by the buyers. Prices fell drastically wherever their influence reached. Silk Grade C, followed by Grade B, first hit the limit down. At this time, the bonds were worth only 46% to 90% of their face value, and the future seemed bleak. However, even in this turmoil, the financial community continued to provide support. They worked even harder as the environment became more dangerous. As a result of their efforts, they achieved considerable success and gained the support of the Northern financial community and the yarn and flower industry. Therefore, on Wednesday, they quickly turned into limit up. Although there were minor twists and turns in the following three days, the sellers were unable to shift the situation. People's hearts were happy and prosperous. Stimulated by changes in the banking system and soaring commodity prices, the foundation became more stable.

It has been found that the number of bonds sold by sellers last week was still very large; however, they were all absorbed by the buyers. Their strength is immeasurable by ordinary standards. Recently, the extremely high discount rate for call loans has caused public bonds to be priced based on call loans. Therefore, they have been devalued by approximately 90% according to the discount rate. At a time when a large amount of cash is being swept away by speculators, call loan positions are feeling a lack of outlets. Therefore, purchasing public bonds has become a win-win situation. As a result, even in the midst of currency turmoil, the bond market has been able to maintain a firm position, demonstrating that its foundation is solid and cannot be shaken by external forces. It is generally predicted that public bonds will be the final destination for speculative funds.

### Rumors Turn Out to Be True: Currency Market Takes Flight

The foreign currency market experienced a significant surge, just as speculators had hoped. The intensity of the trend not only exceeded the expectations of ordinary speculators but also created a record of unprecedented change. The rumor of raising the reserve exchange rate, which had been circulating in the market for a month, was finally realized. It rose day by day, becoming more and more intense. As a result, buying interest from all parties also became stronger and stronger as the price rose. Military scrip rose from $7.45 at the beginning of the week to $8.15. The exchange rate change was realized on Friday (May 20), but it was less than expected, so it fell back to $7.77.

### Do Not Poison Your Children!

â Yan Zheng

In a hospital waiting room, I saw a woman holding a child. The woman suffered from a severe venereal disease, and she walked with a limp. The child's face, hands, and feet were covered in sores.

The child was still sucking the woman's milk with his bright eyes!

Two or three kind-hearted patients dissuaded the woman, saying, "You are sick yourself, don't give him your milk! He is already nine months old. Can't you feed him a little porridge?"

The woman listened without agreeing or disagreeing, only saying that her disease was transmitted to her by her boss. She had given birth to four children herself, and they had all died soon after birth. This child was adopted from an orphanage. As she spoke, she fully displayed her "feminine virtue," without the slightest expression of resentment.

The child was still sucking the woman's milk with his bright eyes! ...

But such poisoning of children is obvious. On the other hand, the poisons that parents generally transmit to their children in spirit are more dangerous because they are often unconscious. In the current situation where parental authority still dominates most families, things like the above are common. Parents subjectively or subconsciously infect their children with their own old mental and behavioral problems, wanting their children to follow in their footsteps and imitate them in everything, when in fact they themselves were never good examples! We know that children have more "plasticity" than adults, so before they have grown up, they have been made to lose the soul of a "person"!

If we want children to grow up to be real people, I think we can only stop feeding them poisonous milk immediately. If there is no nutritious milk, then porridge will do!

Otherwise, if the necessary conditions for being a "person" are lost, it will be difficult to sustain life, let alone develop?

### Poison Gas Experts: Insects

â Luo Wen

Before humans invented poison gas, insects were already using various kinds of poison gas. Some ants can spray strong "formic acid." If someone recklessly brings their face close to an ant nest, their skin will definitely burn. The strong breath often causes irritation of the nose. This is clearly the forerunner of modern mustard gas.

The best users of poison gas are beetles. Even the beautiful ladybug will emit a foul odor when treated roughly. But the most ingenious method is that of the one-third-inch-long, dark blue and red bombadier beetle, which emits a liquid in all directions. Once the liquid comes into contact with the air, it explodes slightly, turning into a foul-smelling blue gas. As a defense tool, it is extremely effective, allowing the tiny bombadier beetle to easily escape many large insects that try to prey on it.

Another beetle that can emit fierce poison gas is the fierce-looking rove beetle. This is a common shell beetle in the garden, which is naturally belligerent. Even if a cane touches it, it will attack it fiercely. First, it curls up its tail, and then emits a strong odor from the two yellow glands at the end of its tail.

In addition, there is a common insect in the garden that can emit an odor. That is the lacewing, which we can see flying weakly in the garden in the summer dusk. Its body is green and has a pair of pearl-like yellow eyes. When teased, it actually emits a foul odor that cannot be washed away even with soap and water.

Among insect larvae, the most skilled at emitting poison gas is the European swallowtail. When it is quietly feeding, it seems to be a gentle and beautiful insect. But when threatened by enemies, it immediately shrinks its head back, showing an extremely fierce "face." At the same time, it extends the two red lines at the end of its tail in a seemingly hateful manner. If this "psychological warfare" still cannot repel the enemy, then it will shoot out a very unpleasant acidic liquid.

### Night-Illuminating Shovel

â Shen Xiong

During wartime, all work is accelerated, so it is often necessary to work at night. However, outdoor work at night is very inconvenient. You cannot see your fingers in front of your face. What can you do? The night-illuminating shovel was born to meet this need. There is a light head on the shovel, so you can see the target clearly whether you are working in the coal store or in the garden. The manufacturing method is to attach a flash lamp to the handle of the shovel with a clip. If a farmer's shovel or hoe has this device, you can still work as usual even after the sun has set. Cleaners or gardeners can also clear snow from the roads at night.

### Crying and Laughing Machine

â Geng Bi

An American physicist has invented a mysterious machine that can emit certain special electrical waves. After people feel them, they will cry or laugh uncontrollably. It is planned to install this machine in theaters. When a comedy is being performed, it will broadcast happy electrical waves. After the audience's nerves receive this electrical wave, they will all laugh heartily for hours. If it is a tragedy, it will broadcast sad electrical waves, and the audience will weep bitterly, as if their parents had died. No matter how ordinary the plot is or how clumsy the actors' skills are, it can achieve extraordinary effects.

Some people predict that after the "crying and laughing machine" is released, the box office of theaters will be unimaginably successful, and at the same time, this machine will make the theater world shine.

I think this is impossible because when this machine is used, the audience's emotions are passive and unnatural. They laugh wildly (or cry loudly) as if their laughter acupoints have been pressed. They cannot appreciate the plot. As a result, it only makes their nerves overstimulated, and customers will definitely not patronize it.

### Sharing the Same Boat in Storms

(5) Reciprocal Retaliation

Cui Zhen said, "When I heard this, I immediately felt dizzy and disoriented, as if an arrow was piercing my heart. I fainted." Guo Fang said, "What happened to your cousin later?" Cui Zhen said, "I fainted, and I didn't know anything." Guo Fang felt ridiculous and said, "Cui Zhen, you should be patient and optimistic. I'm not helping you to say bad things about your uncle. He is simply a villain. Why get angry with a villain? If the Second Aunt here allows it, you can leave the countryside and come with me to live in Shanghai for a few days. Let your uncle know that Cui Zhen doesn't have to live in the countryside." Cui Zhen laughed, "Is someone like me worthy of going to Shanghai? Going to Shanghai, I'll be seen as a maidservant, that's for sure." Guo Fang said, "What are you talking about? Don't overestimate the people of Shanghai. Are all the women who live in Shanghai graceful and noble like young ladies or young mistresses? Even if they have some resemblance, Cui Zhen, you are not necessarily unlike them. Can you lose to them in terms of modern fashion? Can you lose to them in terms of beauty?"

Guo Fang conveniently complimented Cui Zhen a few times. Cui Zhen forgot her grief and anger and laughed, "It's not possible for me to go to Shanghai. These few days, I've been staying at Brother Cheng's house. Now that I think about it, it's not possible for me to leave Brother Cheng's house either. There are many things that the Second Aunt can't think of, He Ma can't think of, and Brother Cheng can't think of even more..." Guo Fang suddenly grasped Cui Zhen's hand and shook it a few times. Cui Zhen knew from Guo Fang's expression that he was going to say something unusual. Sure enough, Guo Fang smiled lightly and said, "I heard someone say that Cui Zhen came and won't leave again. Simply put, you are a member of the Ye family now. Because Mr. Ye is in mourning, it hasn't been announced yet. In the future, in the future, there will definitely be no problem, right?" (84)
