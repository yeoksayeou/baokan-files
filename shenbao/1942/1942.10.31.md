### Germany Advances Towards Nalchik, Consolidating Newly Occupied Positions; German Forces Continue to Occupy Multiple Factories in Stalingrad; Red Army Launches Fierce Offensive in the City's South

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 30th - German-Romanian forces have occupied the city of Nalchik in the eastern Caucasus, a strong pillar of defense for the Soviet Grozny oil region, situated on an important motor road to Grozny and the Caspian Sea. It is unknown whether the German forces will continue their advance there, but for now, they will continue to push southward to consolidate their newly occupied positions within the Nalchik area. Since occupying Nalchik and annihilating the Soviet forces west of Terek, the German-Romanian forces have been able to develop their forces in other directions. At the same time, the German forces are also making continuous progress in the Tuapse area in the northwestern Caucasus. The German forces have continued to occupy more houses in Stalingrad, and it seems that they will advance to break through the Soviet factory defense line on the Volga River. The Soviet feint attacks in the south of the city have all been repelled by the German forces.

Haitong News Agency, Ankara, 30th - Although the Soviet communiqu√© released last night stated that fighting was continuing in Stalingrad, Nalchik, and areas northeast of Tuapse, Moscow Radio reported that German forces in the Nalchik area had broken into the Red Army's defense line, and the Soviet forces, outnumbered, were forced to retreat. The fighting in Stalingrad is still very fierce.

Havas, Berlin, 30th - The High Command announced this morning that yesterday the Red Army continued to launch harassing attacks in the south of Stalingrad, which again failed. In the eastern Terek area, the Red Army's attempt to break through was unsuccessful. At the foothills on both the north and south sides of the Tuapse highway, the Red Army's repeated counterattacks also failed. On the Caspian Sea front, the German Air Force sank nine enemy ships last night, including seven oil tankers. The Red Army once attempted to cross the Don River but was blocked by Italian forces. In the Ostashkov area, most of the twelve strongholds occupied by the enemy have been destroyed. The port of Murmansk was again bombed by German aircraft.

Havas, Stockholm, 29th - Moscow Radio announced today that German forces continue to make progress in the Nalchik area, but in Stalingrad, two German offensives were repelled, one of which was near a factory. The German forces used many tanks in the offensive.

Havas, Stockholm, 29th - On the Stalingrad front, German forces yesterday occupied a flour mill and an oil depot south of the "October Revolution Factory." They are currently bombarding the railway station in the middle of the commercial and industrial areas with heavy artillery and aircraft. The fortifications there are strong, and infantry cannot advance without first destroying them by bombing. According to the German "Guard" report, the fighting in Stalingrad is unprecedented and its nature is by no means comparable to a local conflict. The Soviet army is constantly sending fresh troops to the front, which is actually equivalent to a large-scale war in the entire region. As for the German rear, which was previously considered to have been cleared of Soviet forces, Soviet guerrillas still appear from time to time recently. Yesterday, the results of the attacks launched by the German and Soviet armies against each other in the northwest and southern suburbs of Stalingrad are contradictory, and the detailed situation is still difficult to determine. Generally, the German army has an advantage in the south of the city and has forced the Soviet army to withdraw from several streets in the Gubronskoye area in the southern suburbs of Stalingrad. However, the current situation in the section between the Don and Volga rivers in the northwest of Stalingrad is favorable to the Soviet army. According to Soviet news, although the German army concentrated 200 tanks, the Soviet army was still able to expand the gaps in the German front line. In terms of the overall situation, there is no doubt that the German High Command intends to completely occupy Stalingrad before winter with minimal sacrifice. The situation in Terek and Tuapse is also gradually becoming serious for the Soviet Union. If the Soviet army cannot hold the line of Stalingrad and the Caucasus in the next few weeks, the German army may still make significant progress before the cold winter. The fierce battle is currently raging on the Tuapse port front. It is reported that the German army has occupied an important high ground yesterday.

The Japanese Diet Sends Congratulatory Telegram to Admiral Yamamoto's Fleet

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 30th - Today, the Japanese House of Peers, represented by Chairman Matsudaira, sent a telegram to Admiral Yamamoto, Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, and all commanders, stating that since the great victory in the Solomon Islands sea battle, the Imperial Navy has continued to fight in that area, destroying enemy warships everywhere. Its power has been widely publicized at home and abroad. Now, it has annihilated a strong enemy fleet in the South Pacific and achieved brilliant results. Its loyalty, bravery, and valor are deeply admired. On behalf of the House of Peers, we wish the Imperial Navy victory and pray for the bravery of the soldiers. We also express our deep sympathy to the fallen and wounded soldiers.

### Sino-Japanese Cultural Association Holds Second Anniversary Celebration

Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th - The Sino-Japanese Cultural Association held a grand second anniversary celebration at 3 p.m. today, as well as the inauguration ceremony of the newly built Xingya Hall and the opening of the First Art Exhibition. Honorary Chairman Wang Jingwei presided over the meeting. Ambassador Shigemitsu, Honorary Directors Xu Suzhong, Director-General Ota of the Xingya Institute, Director-General Chu Minyi, Executive Directors Chen Qun and Lin Baisheng, Directors and Supervisors Chen Chunpu, Chen Jicheng, Cai Pei, Fan Zhongyun, Yan Jiazhi, Wang Xiu, Shimizu, and other representatives of all members, Shanghai, Wuhan, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, North China and other branch associations, as well as Deng Zuyu, Chief of the Capital Police, Li Ou, Garrison Commander, Lieutenant General Yamauchi of the Allied Forces, Navy Advisor Teraoka, Director of the Special Service Agency Harada, Military Police Commander Kimura, Colonel Yoshii of the General Headquarters, Chief of the Press Department Iwasaki, Captain Tomita of the Military Police, and hundreds of people from the Overseas Chinese Delegation from Nagasaki who came to Nanjing for sightseeing attended the event. At 3:15 p.m., the commemorative ceremony was solemnly held in the Peace Hall. Honorary Chairman Wang Jingwei arrived at the podium amidst military music. After the ceremony, Director-General Chu Minyi first gave the opening speech, and Secretary-General Zhang Chao reported on the association's work over the past two years. Then, Honorary Chairman Wang Jingwei was invited to give instructions, followed by speeches by Ambassador Shigemitsu and Director-General Ota of the Xingya Institute. After Director-General Chu Minyi's reply, the constitution was amended and directors and supervisors were re-elected. The commemorative ceremony then concluded. At 4 p.m., Director-General Chu Minyi led all the guests and members to the front of the Xingya Hall to hold the inauguration ceremony. First, Director-General Ota of the Xingya Institute cut the ribbon, and then Director-General Chu Minyi immediately opened the door. Then, everyone followed the Chairman into the hall to visit the First Art Exhibition. All the exhibits, totaling more than 300 pieces, were selected and collected by the General Association and branch associations in Shanghai, Wuhan, and other places.

Chairman Wang's Speech

The main points of Chairman Wang's instructions are as follows: The responsibility of creating East Asian culture through Sino-Japanese cooperation is of utmost importance. In this era of the Greater East Asia War, it is an urgent task. We must deeply reflect on the work of the past two years. Creating East Asian culture is a movement. All movements must have a center of gravity, and all work must have a focus. I hope that we will make efforts in this direction in the future.

Ambassador Shigemitsu's Congratulatory Speech

Ambassador Shigemitsu delivered the following congratulatory speech: The Sino-Japanese Cultural Association is holding its second anniversary celebration here today. I am very fortunate to be able to participate in this grand event and say a few words of congratulations. Since its establishment, the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association has relied on the continuous efforts of all its staff and the great support of all relevant parties to make considerable achievements in the exchange and promotion of Sino-Japanese culture. It has also successively established branch associations in Shanghai and other places, and has gradually developed. It is truly worthy of celebration. Last year, at the association's inauguration ceremony, Chairman Wang Jingwei said that Sino-Japanese cooperation in culture to promote Oriental culture is the only way to achieve perfect results in the construction of the new East Asia. These are wise words. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, their significance has become even greater. The construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere cannot be established without laying its foundation on the promotion of Oriental culture. This goes without saying. Furthermore, Sino-Japanese cooperation in the integration and development of culture is not only a driving force for achieving the goal of good neighborly friendship between the two countries, but also a way to contribute to the world's cultural movement to ensure peace in East Asia. The mission of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association is of utmost importance. I deeply hope that all relevant parties will fully recognize this mission and redouble their efforts to promote the development of the association's work. I have briefly stated what I have in mind. I wish the association a happy second anniversary and pray for its prosperity.

Appointment of Directors and Supervisors

Director-General Chu Minyi publicly read the amended constitution. In addition to the original directors and supervisors, the association's board of directors and supervisors approved the addition of five directors, seven alternate directors, and two supervisors yesterday. The names of the newly added members are listed below: Zhou Xuechang, Zhou Longxiang, Zhang Chao, Shuji Kato, and Shichitaro Yada, the above five are directors; Peng Nian, Guo Xiufeng, Xue Fengyuan, Wang Jiajun, Sun Zheng, Hao Fu, and Ichiji Maeda, the above seven are alternate directors; Wang Xiu and Tian Zhengxiu, the above two are supervisors.

### Japanese Spokesman Comments on South Pacific Battle Situation; U.S. Fails in Solomon Islands Campaign; Strategic Position Will Be Seriously Affected

Domei News Agency, Tokyo, 30th - Information Bureau spokesman Hori recently criticized the Japanese announcement of the Japanese Navy's victory in the South Pacific, saying, "The U.S.'s frustration clearly shows that 'Roosevelt's armchair strategy has failed.'" The U.S. launched this half-hearted offensive mainly for political purposes, aiming to stir up the declining morale of the American and Allied people with a "grand performance." The announcement of the Japanese Navy's victory came on the eve of the first wartime Navy Day in the United States. It is not difficult to imagine the shock to the American people and their prestige. The inner circles of Washington are now preemptively declaring that they will do their best to attack Japan in order to control the reaction after the defeat. President Roosevelt believes that it is urgent to approve a naval budget of 1.5 million yuan to try to alleviate the excitement after the harvest and to deceive the American people. The U.S. President approved the naval budget when reports of U.S. losses poured into the United States, and with strict censorship, most of the reports of defeat were not known to the public. President Roosevelt may approve any amount of funds necessary to make up for the losses, but Japan can assure the American people that the Pacific is wide and deep enough to accommodate the ships, cannons, and airplanes created by the Roosevelt regime by extorting money from taxpayers. The spokesman also ridiculed the U.S. Navy Secretary Knox's statement that the Japanese announcement "is just another fishing trip for them" to conceal the truth. He said that this statement is indeed as it says in terms of meaning, and Japan has caught a lot, because U.S. warships "were shot down like dumb ducks." This is borrowing Baldwin's words. No matter how the U.S. government conceals the truth, it will not be able to hide it for long. Admiral Edward's statement that "the U.S. fleet is outnumbered in the South Pacific" has already warned the American people to prepare for bad news. The importance the U.S. attaches to the South Pacific situation can be seen from the news coming out of the U.S. According to Washington observers, "The United States is now more concerned about the Pacific war, because Americans are actively fighting in the South Pacific more than anywhere else in the world, and the majority of the U.S. Navy Reserve changed their minds in August and September, advocating an offensive against Japan." They also said that "The Allies must regain some key points in the South Pacific in order to launch a counterattack, and the Solomon Islands campaign is the most serious test of U.S. strength and prestige." The U.S. government reported to the press and the public, demanding immediate large-scale land, sea, and air force reinforcements to the Solomon Islands, because the stronghold there could enable the Allies to launch a strong counterattack against Burma. However, these demands and hopes have been shattered by the setbacks suffered in the past few days. The situation in the South Pacific was already very serious before the great naval battle of October 26, as evidenced by the dismissal of Admiral Ghormley. Washington insiders also believe that Ghormley's dismissal was due to the unsatisfactory development of the Solomon Islands campaign. Changing generals when the battle has reached a decisive time proves that the U.S. Navy was already in a desperate situation at that time. Admiral Halsey, who took over command during this largest battle, told reporters in Melbourne, "If the United States fails in this battle, the entire strategic position of the U.S. military will be seriously affected. The fate of the U.S. forces in the South Pacific is tied to the success or failure of the U.S. fleet currently threatened by the Japanese Navy." Admiral Halsey's "if" has been answered, because the United States has failed in this battle, and the fate of thousands of U.S. troops is now doomed. The whole world knows this is a fact, only a few strategists in American armchairs hope to gain political capital from their expected victory.

Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama's Speech

Domei News Agency, Local Dispatch - At a reception for journalists yesterday, Japanese Army spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama compared the solidarity between the Axis and Allied countries and made the following comments: "The signs of disunity within the Allied war camp are becoming increasingly obvious. In particular, the Allied people are gradually losing trust in their leaders, because the Allied leaders are constantly trying to deceive the people, making them hold hope for future victory." There are many reasons for disagreements between the Allies, and the gradual loss of morale among the Allied forces is the best example of the disunity of the so-called United Nations. No matter how the enemy leaders publicize their possible counterattacks against the Axis in the future, their constant defeats will inevitably cause their people to lose their trust in their leaders. If the Allies try to deceive their people to a certain period, the truth will eventually be revealed, which will reduce public confidence. Regarding this point, the Japanese Army has a saying: "Leaders must allow their subordinates to hold the hope of gaining special victories in the future in order to maintain their confidence." Speaking of the future development of disunity among Japan's enemies, they have suffered repeated defeats and still issue false news, such as announcing the loss of ships after a long period of time. The Allies admitted their defeats at the beginning of military operations, but insisted that they could win the final victory, so as to give their people empty hopes for the future. On the other hand, the Allies did not try to hide their setbacks on land, because defeats on land cannot be concealed. Ships travel the seas, so their whereabouts can be hidden. Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama also compared the firm solidarity between the Axis countries and their allies with the disagreements among the Allies and quoted a saying from the famous Chinese book Sun Tzu's Art of War: "Heaven's timing is not as good as earth's advantages, and earth's advantages are not as good as human harmony" to refer to the discord in the Allied camp. Disputes often arise in the British Empire, such as the animosity between England and Ireland, and the current situation in India, the treasure house of Britain, are examples. As for the United States, according to Japanese expatriates who have returned to Japan, there are both war factions and isolationist factions, and the most important reason for the country's divergent views on the war is that the cause is unjust. The spokesman concluded by saying that there are few exchanges of envoys between the Axis countries, which gives the Axis leaders the opportunity to devote all their attention to the war effort. The frequent exchanges of envoys between the Allies show their disunity. This is a fact that the Axis enemies recognize and fear. The dispatch of these envoys is to prevent the trend of divergent opinions. If the Allies suffer more defeats, the exchange of their envoys will inevitably be more frequent.

Hirota Expresses His Views

Domei News Agency, Local Dispatch - At a reception for journalists yesterday, Japanese Embassy spokesman Hirota claimed that after Japan's victory in the South Pacific naval battle, the Pacific War has entered a new stage. Since Britain and the United States have lost their naval power in the entire Pacific region, their territories, which are connected only by sea routes, must also be lost. Before the war, we knew that the U.S. Navy existed only on paper, but after the war, it became clear that this navy is actually a tinplate navy. One of the important facts that Japan attaches importance to is that no matter how hard the United States tries to rebuild its navy, even if the United States has actually built many warships, its naval power is definitely not enough to fight the Japanese Navy. At the beginning of the war, the Allies announced that they were fully prepared to launch a counterattack to regain their lost bases, but this well-prepared counterattack was repelled by the Japanese army when it was launched in the Solomon Islands. This factor will have a great impact on the future development of the war. At present, the United States has announced that it is building a two-ocean navy of 3 million tons, but if the United States intends to keep these ships in port to wait for the completion of the two-ocean navy, then Japan can completely defeat them within this period. If the United States intends to send these ships to fight one after another as soon as they are built, then the Japanese Navy can defeat them one by one. The allies of Britain and the United States, namely Chongqing and Australia, should remember that their transportation is maintained only by sea power. At present, the Hawaiian Islands and the U.S. Pacific Navy are in danger, and the transportation routes to Australia and South America will have no defense. Therefore, the days of Australia can be numbered. The spokesman briefly reviewed the impact of the naval defeats suffered by the United States, saying that the defeat at Pearl Harbor reduced the strength of the U.S. Navy by half, which also weakened the strength of Singapore. This result was obtained only within three days after the start of the war. The successive fall of Singapore and the Philippines into Japanese hands enabled Japan to establish an unshakeable position in the area from the East Indies to Burma and the Far South.

### Japanese Greater East Asia Ministry to be Established Tomorrow

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 30th - The Japanese Greater East Asia Ministry will be established on November 1, completing the wartime administrative system for the war and the construction of Greater East Asia. The main points of the establishment of the Greater East Asia Ministry are to handle the political affairs of foreign countries and regions within the Greater East Asia region in a unified manner, so as to strongly promote political, economic, cultural, and other affairs. After the establishment of the Greater East Asia Ministry, the Overseas Affairs Ministry's Manchurian Affairs Bureau, the Asia Development Board, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' East Asia Bureau, and the South Seas Bureau will all be merged into this ministry. The official system of the Greater East Asia Ministry follows the spirit of administrative simplification, with the focus on being efficient, strong, simple, and concise. The organization consists of four bureaus: the General Affairs Bureau, the China Affairs Bureau, the Manchuria Affairs Bureau, and the Southern Affairs Bureau, as well as the Deliberation Officer's Office. The Greater East Asia Minister has the power to implement all kinds of political affairs in the Greater East Asia region, excluding Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Karafuto, protect Japanese commerce in foreign countries within the Greater East Asia region, and manage immigration and overseas development projects and foreign cultural projects in that region. Therefore, the Greater East Asia Ministry is in name and in fact fully responsible for the political, economic, cultural, and other aspects of the Greater East Asia region. With regard to the independent countries of Manchuria, Thailand, and Vietnam, the ministry will also use appropriate methods to cultivate the comprehensive economic power of Greater East Asia. In order to complete the war, all political affairs other than pure diplomacy will be integrated into the Greater East Asia Ministry.

### How to Save China

‚Äî Wang Zhaoming

Chairman Wang delivered a speech on the 28th at the Huai Ren Tang in Beijing to representatives of the Xinmin Society, representatives of Beijing students, and representatives of the people. This was recorded by a reporter from the Central News Agency and approved by the Chairman. Fellow compatriots, it hasn't been easy for me, and today I am here again to meet with you all. I didn't prepare a speech; I think that a speech without preparation might be the most sincere. Fellow compatriots, you must be wondering whether China can ultimately be saved or not. My answer is that China can definitely be saved. Perhaps you see such a dangerous environment and such a difficult situation, and you wonder if there is any way to save China, thinking that my words are merely for consolation. I want to solemnly say again that China can definitely be saved. How to save it? First, we must have determination, and second, we must have a path. Let's talk about determination first. When I arrived in Beijing the day before yesterday, I was very emotional. Thirty-three years ago, when I came to Beijing, I was determined to die here. I didn't expect that after thirty-three years, I would still be alive, and that I would be meeting with you all again at a time when the country is in a life-or-death situation. Thirty-three years ago, I was sentenced to life imprisonment. At that time, I had no future personally. In prison, every morning, I would just repeat two sentences over and over again: the future of China, the future of China. I used these two sentences to sustain my life each day. I didn't expect that after thirty-three years, I would still be here discussing with you all whether China has a future. The future of China, this sentence is the root of my lifelong revolutionary determination, and it is also the root of the life of the Republic of China. Fellow compatriots ask me whether China has a future. I am certain that it does. Why? Because we still have 400 million compatriots, 400 million compatriots with hearts that have not died. This is the only and greatest basis for saving China. In the world today, nothing is more important than conscience. The heart of 400 million compatriots to keep China alive forever will surely save China. This can be asserted. This is talking about the spiritual aspect. Let's talk about the material aspect. In the past, people often said that China has vast lands and abundant resources. This statement was not very accurate in the first place, and after years of turmoil, we are extremely poor. We should no longer use these words to boast. In our extreme poverty, we must use all our spirit to create the material strength we need. We must know that the power of the spirit is the root of all power. Only with the power of the spirit can we create material power, use material power, and defeat countries. Countries that won, like Japan and Germany, go without saying. Countries that lost, like France, were among the most materially deficient countries, and they suffered defeat. They didn't even have the wool to make hats and clothes. However, French scientists, through diligent research and experimentation, finally invented wool substitutes, using hair to replace wool. Not only brown hair and chestnut hair, but also black hair can be chemically processed into wool substitutes. France then started a hair-saving movement. Hair that was cut off in the past was useless and always swept away. Now, every barbershop has a basket ready to collect the hair cut from men, women, and children, and the government collects it all and sends it to factories to make felt hat materials. France only has a population of 30 million. According to statistics from June of this year, the amount of hair collected was 211 tons. Hair is not as heavy as coal and iron, but this quantity is still considerable. There are three things we should pay attention to here: first, the scientific spirit of scientists who work hard year after year, constantly researching and experimenting; second, the firm patriotism of all 30 million French people; and third, the ability to organize. Without patriotism, even with scientific inventions, it is futile. Without organization, even with patriotism, it is just a pile of loose sand, unable to concentrate the cut hair and turn uselessness into usefulness. Comparing it to France, the hair cut by 30 million French people amounts to 211 tons. How much would 400 million of us have? Hair is just one example; other things go without saying. Even if we ourselves are not threatened by hunger and cold, we cannot help but think about how many compatriots in China are suffering from hunger and cold. However, as long as we have determination and organization, we will never let 400 million compatriots be threatened by hunger and cold to the point of national subjugation and extinction. Fellow compatriots, just talking about keeping warm, North China still has wool, and other places still have wool. Even if we have nothing else, we still have our hair. As long as we pull the hair from our heads and gather the hair of 400 million people, we can alleviate some of the suffering of our compatriots. Speaking of this dream, as long as we have the power of the spirit, we don't have to fear the lack of material power. Let us not blame heaven, let us not blame others, let us not be pessimistic, let us not be depressed, let us not think that we have no power. We are full of power. Since the beginning of the peace movement, some comrades have become discouraged when they encounter difficulties, and some have even committed suicide by jumping into the sea. However, the responsibility of saving the country cannot be fulfilled by death alone. We are born as Chinese, where can we escape between heaven and earth? The nation's crisis can only be endured by gritting our teeth, and the nation's future can only be striven for by braving dangers. Everyone, the bodies of our 400 million compatriots are filled with power. We are only afraid that we lack the spirit of science, the determination of patriotism, and the ability to organize. If 400 million compatriots have the spirit of science, determination, and organization, and unite the hearts of 400 million people, we will surely be able to save China.

However, we must not only have the determination to save the country, but we must also have a grand path to save the country.

I often tell my compatriots and comrades that if China does not obtain freedom and equality, it cannot share the responsibility of East Asia, and China's complete attainment of freedom and equality must be sought in the liberation of East Asia. (To be continued)

### The Tenth of the Month Settlement Period: Total Closure of Credit Loans

Estimated 100 Million Yuan in New Rollover Loans; Prudent Guarantee Required for Careful Consideration

Today marks the tenth-of-the-month settlement period for various silver firms and industries. All banks, firms, and companies will make a total closure on long-term credit loans for the tenth of the month today. At a time when the entire financial situation is stable, all industries are able to cope with ease and pass the tenth of the month smoothly. (1) The loans of various banks and firms that are due on the tenth of the month, when converted into Central Reserve Bank notes, total approximately 50 million yuan. The banks will be flexible in rolling over the loans for those borrowers with good credit, but they must pay off all the interest that is due, sign a new loan agreement, and appropriately increase the loan interest rate. Those loans that are not approved for rollover must be repaid in full by the borrowers through adjusting their financial positions, in order to maintain the inherent credit of commerce. (2) New long-term credit loans have been directly negotiated and concluded between various industries and banks. Banks will grant loans based on the agreed-upon loan principles, but only to the extent that they are necessary for the legitimate business needs of the industries. Particular care will be taken in the examination and approval process to prevent the use of bank funds for illegal activities such as speculation and hoarding. Although it is difficult to accurately estimate the total amount of concluded loans, it is estimated to be over 50 million yuan. (3) The contract terms and interest rates stipulated in the new credit loans must be repaid in full when due. At the same time, solid guarantors must complete guarantee forms, guaranteeing that if the borrowed funds cannot be repaid when due, the guarantors will repay the outstanding funds and interest in full, and voluntarily waive the right of prior protest. (4) Thanks to the efforts of the Central Reserve Bank and the Joint Reserve Board of Banks in regulating the overall financial situation, it has remained stable as always. Yesterday, the interbank lending rate in the market was still 14%, with no significant fluctuations. The collection and settlement of funds by banks and the exchange of bills have been busy in recent days, which is a typical phenomenon for the tenth-of-the-month settlement period.

### Municipal Council: Ban on Charcoal Kilns

The Information Office of the Municipal Council issued a public notice stating that recently, a considerable number of charcoal kilns have been established in the eastern and western districts of the Public Concession. When they are making charcoal, smoke often leaks from inside and outside the kilns, which obstructs the neighbors. The public has repeatedly requested that they be banned. Therefore, it is hereby announced that charcoal kilns that are established or similar kilns that are already under construction must not start work without first applying to the Secretary-General of the Council for approval. As for existing kilns of this kind, they should immediately improve their equipment and apply to the Works and Health Departments of the Council for permission to ensure safety and emphasize sanitation.

### Food Oil Distribution Not Yet Proper

Soy Sauce Industry Plans to Submit Representations

Recently, there has been a shortage of cooking oil in the city, causing great distress to residents. Although the Cooking Oil Wholesale Office has vehemently denied that there is any concern about the supply of cooking oil being cut off, it is still difficult to dispel public panic. Unexpectedly, yesterday, the Soy Sauce Trade Association suddenly issued a notice to all members stating that, regarding the distribution of cooking oil by the Shanghai Cooking Oil Trade Wholesale Office, there are no standards, the procedures for receiving and selling oil are extremely cumbersome, and even requests for registration are deliberately made difficult, affecting business operations. They have requested that the association find ways to help. Based on this, it has been found that the distribution by the wholesale office is unfair and the handling is not proper. The association has also heard about the aforementioned situation from time to time. It is hereby specifically notified to all members that if they have encountered the above-mentioned situation or other circumstances that hinder business operations, they should report it to the association in writing within five days so that the cases can be combined and representations can be made to the wholesale office to seek correction and maintain business operations. This is of utmost importance. It has been found that the oil market has recently become chaotic, and there may be disagreements between the Cooking Oil Trade Wholesale Office and the Soy Sauce Trade Association. From the perspective of the citizens, it is hoped that the two organizations will cooperate with each other to maintain the normal supply of cooking oil. Furthermore, it is reported that a black market for cooking oil has emerged in recent days, with prices rising to over ten yuan per catty, and residents sometimes have no way to buy it, causing them great suffering. It is hoped that the relevant authorities will quickly ban it.

### Surge in Unified Public Bonds: Study of Countermeasures

Authorities Decide to Crack Down on Profiteering

Our correspondent from the Tong Meng News Agency reports that the unified public bonds have now surged to 60 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes. In order to crack down on speculation, the relevant authorities are currently studying effective countermeasures to implement in the near future. It is said that the authorities attach great importance to this issue, as profiteering from unified public bonds is regarded as an "enemy action." It has been found that while the authorities have been strictly cracking down on the speculative trading of raw silk and raw cotton, some people have been engaging in the speculative trading of unified public bonds. Unified public bonds were originally around 60 yuan in old legal tender. At the end of May of this year, when the new currency was implemented, the price of unified public bonds was automatically halved. However, by September, its price had soared to 60 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes. Other public bonds and company stocks automatically halved in value after the new currency was implemented. Therefore, the authorities are currently taking strong steps to remedy this situation.

### Prices of Over 3,000 Items Already Limited

Satisfaction Expressed with Control Measures; Appeal for Citizen Cooperation

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reported that Mr. Katsuo Okazaki, Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, met with a reporter from the Japanese-language "Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun" yesterday (the 29th) and stated that, to date, the selling prices of over 3,000 items in Shanghai have been officially limited. The next stage of the Municipal Council's price control policy is to ensure that all stores in the city are supervised by their respective trade associations. The main items already subject to price control regulations include rice, flour, and milk. Pork prices have also recently been limited. The Council is currently considering officially limiting the prices of vegetables and eggs, and will take other control measures as necessary. Mr. Okazaki expressed satisfaction with the progress of the city's price control policy and appealed to all residents to cooperate and avoid unnecessary consumption of goods to the greatest extent possible.

### Household Rice Ration Reduced; White Rice Prices Rise Again

The sale of the 15th period of household rice by rice shops in the two concessions ended yesterday. Today, the rice shops are closing their accounts and closing for one day. Starting tomorrow, they will begin selling the 16th period of household rice, with the purchase quantity reduced to half a liter of white rice and one liter of broken rice, sold for 3.80 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes. In addition, flour can be purchased with a flour purchase certificate, with each flour purchase certificate allowing the purchase of one and a half catties of flour, sold for 3.40 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes. Furthermore, according to a report from a reporter from the Datong News Agency, although restaurants in the city can apply to the Municipal Council to receive household rice, the selling price per bag has not changed, but the price of white rice sold has increased from 60 cents to 80 cents per small bowl. As for the farmers who carry rice from other places on their shoulders to sell, the selling price per dou reached over 60 yuan yesterday.

### Gambling Den Busted on Xin Zha Road

Twenty-Three Chinese Arrested; Police Continue Search for Leaders

According to the English-language "China Times," detectives from the Central Police Station, in a swift operation, busted a gambling den on Xin Zha Road, number 920, at 1:20 PM yesterday (the 29th), arresting twenty-three Chinese. According to police, the leader of the gambling den received advance warning and escaped before the detectives arrived, but failed to hide the evidence of operating this illegal lottery. The police confiscated a large number of gambling paraphernalia and 1,000 yuan in cash. It has been found that the lottery is a form of gambling popular among rickshaw pullers and peddlers, with each ticket selling for 20 cents to one yuan. The lottery is drawn from one of twenty-six numbers, three times a day. The gambling den busted yesterday was discovered after a certain Chinese man was caught selling lottery tickets to rickshaw pullers on Shandong Road.

He is commonly called "Sailboat."

A certain detective saw him and became suspicious, so he quietly watched him sell lottery tickets. After obtaining sufficient evidence, he arrested him and took him to the Central Police Station. After questioning him, he learned that the gambling den was located at 920 Xin Zha Road, so he dispatched detectives to search the address and arrested twenty-three Chinese. According to a certain police officer, this is the first time a lottery has been discovered this year. The lottery is not only a form of gambling but actually a

method of deceiving the public. Those who operate the lottery must choose the number with the fewest bets among the thirty-six numbers to win. The winnings are not calculated according to the number of tickets sold, but only fixed at one times thirty-six. The Xin Zha Road lottery gang has been operating in the Public Concession for several weeks, trying to avoid the eyes and ears of the police, but they were ultimately busted. The police are currently investigating the past activities of the lottery gang and searching for its leaders.

### Wharf Gangsters Defraud Travelers; Police Strictly Crack Down; Robbing Luggage and Extorting "Protection Fees"; Fifteen Arrested and Confess Without Hesitation

The English-language "China Times" reported that yesterday, the 29th, the police disclosed that the Police Department has arrested fifteen vagrants at the Bund wharves for extorting "protection fees." Among them, eight are repeat offenders. These people specifically target travelers coming and going on inland river steamers from the Bund, choosing the more vulnerable ones to extort money from. Most of the victims are farmers coming from the countryside. Although they are defrauded, they dare not report to the police for fear of retaliation.

Making a Living by Extortion

These vagrants have been rampant on the Bund for a long time. Because there were no reports to the police, no action was taken. On average, the vagrant gang can extort 400 to 500 yuan per day. This large-scale arrest was caused by the extortion of five yuan from a certain woman. It so happened that a police officer on patrol at Fujian Road and Jiangxi Road saw the vagrants arguing with the woman. Upon inquiry, he learned that the vagrants were carrying luggage for the woman at the Bund wharf and demanding five yuan, which she refused to pay. The police officer then took both of them to the police station.

Snatching Luggage

After interrogation, it was learned that the woman came from the countryside. When she arrived in Shanghai, the vagrants forcibly carried her luggage and demanded five yuan. The woman refused and hired a porter instead. The vagrants then forcibly snatched the luggage, carried it a few steps, and put it on a rickshaw, demanding "service fees," which led to the dispute. After investigation, the police confirmed that there are a large number of vagrants on the Bund who use this method to extort money from travelers, so they dispatched police officers to arrest the other fourteen vagrants.

Bullying the Ignorant

Prior to this, the police had also received reports of two other cases of extortion. The first was a farmer who wanted to buy a boat ticket to return to Haimen. He was surrounded by a group of vagrants who demanded 75 yuan. When the farmer refused, the vagrants held his luggage hostage. The police intervened and arrested the vagrants. Another case involved a businessman, Mr. Jia, who wanted to return to Chongming. He was also met by a group of vagrants who demanded ten yuan for "ensuring safety along the way." The police also intervened and Mr. Jia was spared from being defrauded. After being taken to the Central Police Station, the vagrants confessed to the extortion of "protection fees."

### Miscellaneous News from All Walks of Life

Mr. Chen Lixian, General Manager of China-Made Underwear Factory Co., Ltd., has extensive experience in this industry. The cotton flannel underwear he produces is made with elastic fibers, which are elastic and comfortable to wear, with the characteristics of not deforming and not pilling.

### A Tour of Six Well-Stocked Libraries (Part 2)

All Kinds of Chinese and Foreign Books Available; Hoping the Public Will Develop a Love of Reading

Admission Instructions

For the Hongying and Mingfu libraries, you only need to buy a reading pass inside the library to enter and read. Hongying has four types of reading passes: annual, half-year, monthly, and temporary, costing 40 yuan, 25 yuan, 6 yuan, and 1 yuan respectively. Students receive a 40% discount. During the current trial period, a 50% discount is offered. Mingfu's annual pass costs 20 yuan, and Zhen Dan's half-year pass costs 5 yuan. It must be guaranteed by a student at Zhen Dan. For the Shanghai Municipal Council Library, you must pay a fee to obtain a green application form. The two blanks on the front should be filled with the borrower's name, and the bottom should be stamped by the store guarantor or school and signed by the manager or headmaster/dean of studies to be able to obtain a borrowing card. The annual fee is 15 yuan, and students with a school certificate only pay 6 yuan. Neither the New Asia Library nor the Customs Library charge fees, but the former requires a deposit of 5 yuan to obtain a borrowing card. For the latter, you must first have a guarantor write a letter requesting an application form. The application form will be sent within a week, and then the guarantor must fill it out, stamp it, and attach a photo. An admission pass will be sent within a week. If you are a student, you need two photos, and the admission pass is valid for only three months. If you are not a student, you only need one photo, and the admission pass is valid for six months. Based on the above situation, the less the fee, the more complicated the procedures, which seems to be a common practice for the six libraries.

The reading room of the New Asia Library has been closed; but other than that, the other five libraries all have a reading room, of which the Shanghai Municipal Council Library is the most complete. Entering through the small door next to the vegetable market, there is an elevator; all members (Subscribers) have the right to enjoy "sitting." Ascending to the third floor is a spacious building with bright windows and clean tables, and fresh flowers are changed at all times. Coal stoves are lit here in winter, and electric fans are turned on in summer; it is truly a "holy place" for reading, and readers can personally enter the stacks (Stock) to select the books they need. Unlike other places where you have to list the book title and hand it to the librarian to retrieve, if you don't do some homework beforehand to understand the "annotations" and summaries of each book, what you get out often won't be satisfactory. If you need to consult many books at once, you can also move them around at will, unlike other places where you can only borrow two or three books at a time, and only borrow three or four times in half a day. More than that will elicit a glare from the librarian. Besides, reading is about comparison and reasoning. To seek knowledge in one subject, you can't only look at books in that subject; any book is relevant. In this regard, the method of the Shanghai Municipal Council Library is very commendable.

If reading is a pastime, this is also the ideal place. Under the south-facing window, there are two sofas where you can recover from fatigue. Chinese and Western novels are displayed in a mixed fashion, and you can browse them at will. If you bring your younger siblings with you, you can also find many children's literature and children's science books, which are enough for your younger siblings to have several days of mental nourishment.

The Zhen Dan Library is affiliated with the university, and most of the people reading there are students, but the reading room is very large and can still accommodate some outsiders. This reading room is upstairs in the new school building on Rue Liven, with fresh air and a vast surrounding view. You can see the tall water tower and magnificent urban architecture, and the place is very quiet, with the sound of church bells and factory whistles morning and evening. The reading rooms of the Customs and Mingfu libraries are relatively small, and the middle of the tables is separated by wooden boards with electric lights installed on them, and there are many similarities in the way people sign their names in a ledger when entering. The reading room of the Hongying Library is slightly smaller. Given the enthusiasm of readers, it is said that there is a possibility of adding more space. Except for the Shanghai Municipal Council Library, you can bring your own books into the reading room. Outside the reading room of the Shanghai Municipal Council Library, there is a place to put items, where you can put the things you bring. If it is necessary to bring them in for reference, you must obtain permission from the librarian.

Regarding reading hours, the Hongying, Shanghai Municipal Council, and Zhen Dan libraries all start at 8:30 AM, and the Customs Library at 9:00 AM. Except for the Shanghai Municipal Council Library, which is open from morning until 6:00 PM, the others stop reading at noon. Zhen Dan stops at 11:00 AM, and Hongying at 11:50 AM. Mingfu is only open in the afternoon from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, and the Customs Library is open in the afternoon from 1:00 PM to 4:30 PM. The others all start at 1:30 PM. The Customs, Hongying, and Mingfu libraries are all open six days a week. The former is closed on Sundays, while the latter two are open as usual on Sundays and closed on Mondays. However, Mingfu is open in the morning, while Zhen Dan and the Shanghai Municipal Council Library are open seven days a week. However, the Shanghai Municipal Council Library opens half an hour later on Sundays, and Zhen Dan is only open in the morning at 9:00 AM. The afternoon session starts at 2:00 PM, each session lasting two hours. The libraries are closed on Sundays during summer vacation. Reading on Sundays is as usual, but it seems that the Li family's collection cannot be accessed. Except for Zhen Dan, which has many special holidays, the rest are closed according to the usual practice.

### Self-Police Cup Charity Football Match: Rosters Announced Yesterday; Clash at Jiaozhou Park Tomorrow at 3 PM

The Public Concession's Civil Defense Guidance Committee-sponsored Self-Police Cup charity football match, a friendly between the Allied team and the Westerners' mixed team, is scheduled to be held tomorrow at 3 PM at Jiaozhou Park. The team lineups, after yesterday's meeting, have been carefully selected, striving to present an ideal match and make the performance even more exciting than the Civil Defense Cup. It is said that the ceremony will be even grander than the Civil Defense Cup. The referee is Zhang Le, and the linesmen are Trosse and Xuan Jiao Zhengzhu.

Allied Roster

Officially announced yesterday, it is similar to the Civil Defense Cup roster, with only slight adjustments to the center-back line. Due to an injury to the right winger Zheng Yingquan, he is unable to play and will be replaced by Qu Yongfu, while Qu's left winger position will be filled by Jiang Chao. Zheng Yingquan's absence is a slight loss, but with Song Lingsheng anchoring the central pivot like a pillar of strength, the team's stability is assured. Coupled with the two iron gates in defense, Li and Zhang, the defense is extremely solid. The five forwards fully demonstrated their sharpness last week.

The mixed team's selection was also made by Zheng from the Western League, gathering elites from various teams. In addition to Xu Erzi, Oliveira, Greenburg, Fuen, and Gain Pantoson, who previously represented the Western League, Mai Diti from the Italian Navy is invited to serve as goalkeeper, Vila as right-back, Nishida from the Japanese Association as right winger, and Su Ruo, formerly of the Portuguese Chamber of Commerce, as left-back. Veteran Western police officer Victai will also reprise his role as right-back. Overall, the team's strength is much stronger than the Western League. At that time, to avenge the shame of the Western League's defeat, they will definitely go all out and give the Allied team a wonderful performance. The lineups of the Chinese and Western teams are recorded below:

### Lawsuit over Damaged Banknote: Fan Keling Loses; French Tramway Suffered Losses, Claim Dismissed and Costs to be Paid

The English "Ta Mei Wan Bao" reports that Fan Keling, the former chairman of the Public Works Bureau, filed a lawsuit against the French Tramway Company with the French Consular Court due to a dispute with a French bus ticket seller who refused to accept a damaged banknote. This morning (30th), the French Consular Court heard the case and ruled against Fan Keling. Judge Corbin of the French Consular Court did not hear testimony from either party this morning but ruled that Fan Keling abused his power and should be responsible for the consequences of the lawsuit. All claims were dismissed, and court costs were to be paid. It was found that when Fan Keling boarded the bus, the ticket seller refused to accept his damaged banknote, so he remained on the bus for 50 minutes and was eventually taken to the police station. After being identified as Fan Keling, he was released. Fan Keling then sued the French Tramway Company to clarify whether the ticket seller had the right to refuse to accept the damaged banknote. However, Corbin stated in his judgment this morning that the French Tramway Company itself had suffered losses due to the incident, both materially, as the bus was stopped for 50 minutes, and spiritually, as various newspapers had reported unfavorably. The ticket seller had the right to refuse to accept the damaged banknote because the banknote presented by Fan Keling was torn six centimeters in the center, and the banknote's total length was seven and a half centimeters, so the banknote was more than three-quarters damaged, and therefore fell into the category of damaged banknotes that could be refused. Fan Keling's claim that the banknote was given to him by the ticket seller the next day was unsubstantiated. In any case, he should have repaired the damaged banknote neatly before using it. Fan Keling's attitude in this dispute was highly questionable.

Commercial News

### Culture and New Music Shares: Strongest Gains

Yesterday, the Chinese stock market continued to rise sharply. The soaring of Culture shares was particularly rare. Unprecedented peaks emerged endlessly, mainly because investors disregarded high prices and absorbed them relentlessly, while those holding stock certificates held onto them in anticipation of higher prices. For example, Commercial Press saw a high of 425 yuan, then fell back slightly by 5 yuan, up 15 yuan; China saw a highest transaction price of 340 yuan, up 17.5 yuan; World saw 130 yuan, then fell back to 120 yuan, up 7 yuan. The department store industry was the most stable, with Wing On and National Goods each rising 1-2 yuan. Among the new pharmaceutical stocks, Sino-French Pharmacy led the gains, breaking through the 90 yuan mark, jumping from 90 yuan to 96 yuan, then settling at 94.5 yuan, up 7.25 yuan; Minyi also rose by 4 yuan, Xin Asia rose by 1.25 yuan, Shanxi slightly retreated to 450 yuan. Due to the continuous rise in raw material prices, Wing On Textile rose by 75 yuan. The small-denomination shares of Great China Weaving, Hongsheng, and Shanghai Machinery Weaving are all currently at 13.5 yuan; Meilun Woolen rose by 7.5 jiao. Xinfeng Printing & Dyeing and Fuchang Dyeing & Weaving are still in a state of high demand and short supply, tending to rise; China Underwear rose by 5 jiao. In the public utilities sector, Zhabei Water & Electricity rose by 1 yuan, China Electric Power added 5 jiao, and Public Credit Electric Appliances traded heavily at 16.5 yuan, then rose to 17 yuan, and is still rising; Great China Matches has fallen by 2.5 yuan, Nanyang Tobacco rose by 1 yuan, with rare transactions, and Xinhua Spray Paint also rose. Today, Saturday, the industry decided to close the market, and several new stocks will be officially traded next Monday. The market price list for today is listed below.

### Government Bonds After the Sharp Drop: Small Rebound Yesterday

The sentiment in the unofficial government bond market yesterday had not yet dissipated, but after the sharp drop, there was a small rebound, but it was not a real positive trend. This is because the money market is tight and has not shown any signs of easing. Although it has moved away from the relationship below 10,000 yuan at the beginning of next week, the demand for funds is still very high. It is rumored that the China Industrial Bank will be collecting payments for shares of the Kang Yuan Canning Factory, and the amount paid will be as high as 10 million yuan. In terms of the money market, it is feared that it will not be able to ease before the share payments are returned, so the rise in government bonds will inevitably be affected by this. Therefore, although yesterday's reaction was strong, it should not be hastily regarded as encouraging. Yesterday, the A and C bonds both broke through the 60 yuan mark, and the trend was still good, but the money market was still an obstacle. As a result of the market price, they all rebounded by 1.5 yuan to 3.3 yuan, with a turnover of about 3.45 million yuan. A brief table is listed below.

### Ornamental Gold Increases

Yesterday, the Shanghai goldsmith industry's Daxin Tonghang jewelry gold price was initially 2,500 yuan per tael. By 11:30, it rose 50 yuan to 2,550 yuan (the purchase price was reduced by about 300 yuan). The industry's trading price has reached over 2,300 yuan, which is also due to the rise of the Allied Bank notes by 5 yuan. The morning high was 20 yuan, totaling 2,280 yuan, and later 2,270 yuan. It rose in buying momentum, reaching 2,315 yuan at noon, an increase of 55 yuan, with a difference of 45 yuan. Transactions were sparse. Finally, it rose to 2,324 yuan, while ornamental silver was priced at 14 yuan per tael. The industry's inter-trade price was 12.3 to 12.6 yuan for buying and selling.

Yesterday, the interbank lending rate of the Money Dealers' Association remained unchanged at 1.4 jiao. Yesterday's foreign exchange market was flat. The industry's inter-trade price was 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 5 fen, and 5.7 li. Banks and small money houses sold for 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 6 fen and 6.5 fen, and purchased for 5 yuan, 5 jiao, and 5 fen.

### Shanghai Yarn Industry and Other Three Banks: Bill Exchange Agency

The Shanghai Bankers' Joint Reserve Committee sent a circular to various banks and money houses yesterday, stating that the Committee will begin to act as an exchange agency for Shanghai Yarn Industry Bank bills on November 2, 1942, and has assigned the bank the exchange number 53/3. Futung and Fuhua Banks have already joined the Committee as exchange agency banks on the 26th of this month. Futung's number is 53/1, and Fuhua's is 53/2.

The Committee also sent a circular stating that Kaitai and Qixin Money Houses have joined the money vault as members. Starting from November 2, the collection of payment bills entrusted by various banks and money houses to these two houses will be handled in accordance with the methods for other member money houses. Furthermore, Ruixiang and Hengyuan Money Houses have also joined the money vault, and the Committee has also handled the bills of these two money houses in the same manner as for member houses.

### Commercial Briefs

Cotton Cloth Rises Sharply: Yesterday, the cloth market rose sharply due to strong demand from all parties. The leading fine cloth, Xinxin Dan, reached 187.5 yuan, and the bank order reached 181 yuan, Caiqiu 180 yuan, and Flying Fish 179 yuan. The initial trading price for Four Gentlemen Serge was 7.2 jiao, and the final transaction price was 7.36 yuan, with the bank order at 7.28 yuan. Factory-made cloth was the most popular, with a shortage of sellers. 60-count Double Fish Elbow Cloth sold for 6.5 yuan, Taohua Lady's Cloth sold for 164.5 yuan, up 6.5 yuan from yesterday, 16-pound Earth sold for 212 yuan, and Flying Goose for 210 yuan, 12-pound Earth Fine Cloth for 180 yuan, and Dapeng for 178 yuan, Chuji Shilin for 258 yuan.

Zha Cai from Hankou is Moving: The Zha Cai produced by Wei Mei Company has recently added Hankou Gang. It is said that there is a need for about 500 jars, so the market is quite strong. Currently, the Wannianqing brand is priced at 380 yuan, and the Jubao Pen brand at 270 yuan. After this batch is shipped out, the company's inventory will become even thinner, and the later market may need to be slightly increased.

Dried Peach Sustains Firm: Although walnuts have seen a slight loosening in the recent market, it is difficult to overstate it. However, the trend of peach pulp is firm, and the retail price already requires 1,400 yuan. The remaining hand-picked peaches are 800 yuan, Changping peaches 720 yuan to 700 yuan, Pinggu peaches 700 yuan, Ti peaches 550 yuan, and Nan peaches 501 yuan.

Dried Persimmons: New Crop Approaching: According to information from the dried persimmon production areas, the weather has been less rainy this season, and the fruits have not grown fully, so the size is smaller. At the same time, the dried persimmons are very dry, which is their characteristic. However, the purchasing price for different goods is high, so it is difficult for this item to be uniquely low. New crops will be available soon.

Small Factory-Made Nails are Difficult to Sell: The factory's Yuan nails have been difficult to trade in recent days, with only sporadic purchases from stores. Yesterday, each barrel of 100 pounds sold for 700 yuan, and the retail price at stores ranged from 7 yuan to 7.5 yuan per pound. Divided nails are also difficult to sell, and the quoted prices are stable. Currently, 4-fen colored nails sell for 1,200 yuan per barrel, 5-fen colored nails sell for 1,100 yuan per barrel, and 6-fen goods are priced at 1,000 yuan.

### A Critique of Li Zongyi's "Heavenly Thunder Report"

‚Äî Chang Ming

On the evening of the 24th, Li Zongyi of the New World performed "Heavenly Thunder Report." This play is rarely performed among the Peking opera actors who came from the south, especially since it is being promoted as a complete Tan school performance. The success of the box office was expected. The performance started after 10 PM, beginning with the entire act of "Thinking of My Son." Li, playing Zhang Yuanxiu, movingly portrayed a poor, elderly man. He often made his beard flutter slightly to show the emotions of an old beggar, demonstrating his intelligence. From beginning to end, both his singing and dialogue were resonant and powerful. Several passages of Erhuang and Pingban were sung with exquisite cadences. His portrayal of anger when arguing with his old wife, his anticipation when waiting for his son at Qingfeng Pavilion, and his resentment before killing himself were all vividly conveyed, which is truly commendable. Ci Shaoquan's Ms. He also tried her best, but her slightly plump figure and occasional clownish gestures detracted from the performance.

In short, the actors in this play were all very dedicated, and there were many highlights throughout the play, especially the quarrel between the old couple, and the suicide scene at Qingfeng Pavilion was even more brilliant. Li's performance was neither too sentimental nor too indifferent, which is much better than many of today's actors. (Donations will be used to support education)

### I Love "Little Women"

After reading Louisa May Alcott's original novel "Little Women," I shed a tear. The moving aspect of the story is how the author has carved out each different typical and lovable character of the four sisters and irrigated them with sincere passion, making you feel that these are your own closest sisters.

When the "Little Women" movie was released, I also watched it twice quickly. I like Tun Tong, the fourth sister, and I think this is a true portrayal of the author herself. Whether it is her gender customs or actions, she jumps into your heart, and you will never forget her rough and lovable impression.

This time, "Zhong Zhong" has put all its efforts into staging Ni's adaptation of "Little Women," directed by Wu Shizhi. The stage settings are rich and magnificent, the sound effects are quite solemn, and the actors are all committed, so the performance is great and unparalleled, leaving a brilliant page in today's theater scene!

The whole play has five acts and scenes. Fei Yin plays the virtuous Meg, Sun Jinglu plays the rough Jo, Lishi plays the coy Beth, and Shamo plays the lively Amy, all of whom are successful.

Others, such as Ma Xiaonong's Mrs. March, capture the loving personality, Tian Bin's Professor Bhaer, display his singing talent, and Wu Chunzhen's aunt, show off her snobbish style, all of which draw your emotions - making you respect, rejoice, hate, grieve, suffer, or shed tears.

Finally, it is worth mentioning that the six-year-old child star Xiao Hu, who guest stars as the white girl, although she has no lines, her jumping on stage is enough to show her overflowing talent. This child has great potential.

### Theater News

The advertising slogan is: Zhou Xuan's divorce protagonist Han Fei, A Thousand Miles Escorting Jingniang protagonist He Bin, screen villain Zhou Chu, standard star Shangguan Yunzhu." They are scheduled to perform until the end of the month and then go to Beiping, Qingdao, Jinan, etc.

Bai Hong has signed a contract with the Minghua Troupe, led by Zeng Yueming, with a monthly salary of 9,000 yuan. Lan Weilie has also joined the troupe.

After "Tears of Blood and Yearning," the New China Troupe will perform "Woman One," written by Hou Yuanqing.

Ding Yi, Di Fan, Tong Yi, etc. have gone to Soviet Russia to perform in a guest capacity for half a month.

The recently established Yiguang Company will give its premiere performance at the Lyceum on the 6th and 7th of next month. The play is a five-act tragedy "Colorful Clouds," written by Li Jianwu, directed by Zhu Duanjun, and starring Xia Xia, Jiang Tianliu, Gu Degang, Huang Zongjiang, Hu Dao, etc.

Jun Yi's recent work, "Silver Star Dream," is said to be based on the life of a certain film star who committed suicide by taking poison (Ai Xia, Ruan Lingyu, or Ying Yin, it will probably be one of these three), and will be performed by the Zhong Zhong Troupe.

"The Big Circus," currently being performed at the Carlton, has become a well-known work. The author of the play, Shi Tuo, whose name seems unfamiliar, can be regarded as a famous novelist. However, why is his play being staged? As far as the reporter knows, Lu Fen has retired from his writing career for more than a year, and "The Big Circus" is his only work. It is unknown whether he will continue to write plays in the future or return to his hometown in Henan.

### Rambling about Yang Naiwu (2)

1. Ge Pinlian's coffin was delivered to Kyoto on the order of Emperor Guangxu on March 17th, year 2, and placed at the Haihui Temple outside Chaoyang Gate. On the 27th, the Ministry of Justice officials opened the coffin for re-examination. Her teeth and throat bones were all white, with no signs of poison. All the officials signed a statement that she died of illness, so it is inaccurate to say that Ge Bi was poisoned to death. It is not a true history that Ge Pinlian's coffin was not delivered to Beijing. Ge Pinlian had a fever and chills on the 7th of October (Tongzhi Year 12), and her knees were red and swollen. Ge Bi wanted her husband to hire someone to replace him at work, but he refused. On the 9th, she returned home from the shop and bought powdered dumplings in front of the snack shop. She immediately vomited, her face turned blue, and she went upstairs to sleep. She wanted to vomit, and Ge Bi covered her with two quilts, but she still shivered. Later, Ge Bi heard phlegm rattling in her throat and hurriedly asked her. She saw white foam coming out of her mouth and could not speak. In a panic, she cried out, and Shen Yu (Ge Pinlian's mother, Ge Yu, who remarried to Shen Ti Ren after the death) called for a doctor. It was thought to be a Sha disease, and they used Radish Seeds to try to save her, but it was ineffective. At Shen time, she died. Ge Pinlian was small and fat, and she died in mid-winter. The southern climate was warm, and by the night of the 10th, the corpse gradually changed. Blood and water flowed from her mouth and nose. Ge's adoptive mother, Feng Xu, claimed that the quick death was suspicious. Shen Yu was confused and knew that Ge Bi was frivolous and worried about other circumstances, so she pleaded to have the body inspected because her son's death was unclear. County Magistrate Liu Xitong accompanied the examiner to inspect the body. At that time, the corpse was swollen and had already changed. The upper body was light cyan-black, and there were several blistered rashes in the abdomen and armpits, which broke when pressed, and the flesh was red-purple. The examiner Shen Xiang did not recognize it as true because blood and water flowed from the mouth and nose into the eyes and ears, and it was mistaken for bleeding from the seven orifices. The nails of the ten fingers and ten toes were dull gray, and it was mistaken for cyan-black. A silver needle was inserted into the throat, and it turned light cyan-black, causing the changed color to be mistaken for poisoning. Because the corpse was soft and not stiff, it was called cigarette poisoning. Shen Caiquan was misled by rumors that Ge Bi and Yang Naiwu had an affair, and he also said that the blue-black blisters on the abdomen were arsenic poison. They argued with each other, so the silver needle was not washed with soapberry water. Shen Xiang could not determine what kind of poison it was and vaguely claimed that she died of poisoning. Liu Xitong interrogated the corpse's relatives and neighbors on the spot, but they all did not know where the poison came from. Ge Bi was taken back to the county office for questioning, and she claimed that she did not know. She was subjected to torture. Ge Bi could not bear the torture. Because her husband's corpse was found to have been poisoned, it was difficult to argue, so she falsely claimed that she had an affair with Yang Naiwu when they lived together. After moving out, Yang Naiwu gave her arsenic poison on the 5th and planned to kill her husband. This is the true story of Ge Pinlian dying of Sha disease, Shen Yu suspecting and requesting an examination, Shen Xiang mistakenly reporting poisoning, and Ge Bi falsely accusing Yang Naiwu.

### Famous Works Will Be on Stage

(1) Qin Shouou's novel "Autumn Begonia" was serialized in this newspaper for a year and was well received by readers. In addition to being made into a movie by the China Union Company, the drama version has also been adapted and the performance rights have been acquired by the Art Troupe at the Carlton. It will be staged soon. The lineup is great, and it will definitely refresh the eyes and ears of Shanghai residents. In addition, Shanghai opera will also be performed. The original author initially disagreed, but because the host of the Wenbin Troupe was sincere and the adaptation was serious, with no damage to the original work, he agreed to Shao Binsun's request to perform at Zhonghua. In addition, Yue opera playwright Fan Li is also discussing with Qin to adapt and perform this book.

(2) The late Mr. Hui Mengpu's work "Love" (i.e., Lu Nanzi) is a rare masterpiece in Chinese literature, selling well at home and abroad. All young readers have a copy. Its content is full of twists and turns, and it is very suitable for staging. It is heard that playwright Bao Lei has obtained the absolute adaptation rights of the play with the consent of Mr. Hui Mengpu's son, Hui Yaocu, and has compiled a five-act, seven-scene, twelve-scene great stage play with the theme of anti-feudalism, in reference to his posthumous works, manuscripts, and historical background. It is also heard that the play will be staged soon, and the director will be Luo Ming, who has just returned to Shanghai from the north.

### "Fragrant Snow Sea" to be Staged Tomorrow

‚Äî Unnamed

Since the Russian song and dance troupe performed, people in Shanghai who like song and dance have had another opportunity to appreciate it. But many of the past song and dance groups do not seem to be as great as this "Fragrant Snow Sea" because "Fragrant Snow Sea" has not only recruited top talents in the song and dance industry, but also arranged new and unique programs. Originally, song and dance were supposed to be known for their novelty and beauty, and it seems that only Fragrant Snow Sea meets these conditions now.

Participating in this grand performance is Miss Liang Ping, a newcomer in the Chinese singing industry. Miss Liang not only has a natural voice and is known as the Golden Voice, but also has an elegant posture. When she sings, her posture also fits the rhythm of what she is singing, so she gives the audience a very good impression. There is also Miss Louise, who was elected Miss Shanghai of this year, and also takes on several rather heavy programs. Her talent is also extraordinary, judging by the title of Miss Shanghai.

In addition to song and dance, there are many other novel things that cannot be listed. Fortunately, they will be meeting the audience at the Great Light tomorrow, so please wait and see.

### Zhang Huichong's Magic

‚Äî Star

Zhang Huichong's magic show has made a comeback and began performing at Dahua yesterday. Zhang Huichong said at the beginning: Magic is a clever performance of science, and the performers do not actually have unexpected magic powers. This is the characteristic of Zhang Huichong's magic. Each program is completed in one or two minutes, or two or three minutes at most, which keeps the audience's emotions in a state of tension at all times. The most exciting programs this time are undoubtedly Knife Escape, Vat Escape, Cannon Escape, and Torturing Women. In addition, the powerful performances of Shijiang Kuanyuli, and the tap dance performances of Xu Lai and Wu Jianzhi are all noteworthy programs.

Letter to the Editor:

To whom it may concern,

I was shocked to read "A Review of the Chinese Amateur Drama Society" in the Entertainment section of the October 24th issue. Although the "Chinese Amateur Drama Society" was once affiliated with our association, it was formally announced to be disbanded last November due to the scattering of its members. Now that I see it reported in the newspaper, I think it is due to inaccurate rumors. Therefore, I am writing to your newspaper to correct it, so as to avoid further misinformation.

Sincerely,

The Student Friendship Association of the Fourth Chinese Vocational Supplementary School.

### Shared Boat in Stormy Weather

‚Äî By He Jia Zhi

(10) Flying Peak

Wei Cheng, holding Cui Zhen's hand, laughed, "Let's go to Aunt's room. I bet Aunt is wearing her glasses and looking at account books." Cui Zhen sat down and said, "I won't go. Brother Cheng, I'm really a useless person." She, fearing Wei Cheng wouldn't believe her, lifted her skirt and then lifted her trouser leg, turning her stocking down to reveal a needle hole near her knee, pierced by Wei Shao Yun with a red-hot iron needle. Yellow fluid was oozing from the needle hole, and the surrounding skin was charred black. Wei Cheng exclaimed, "Ah! How could this happen! Even just seeing it makes me shudder, let alone experiencing it!" Suddenly, a tear fell beside the needle hole, and Cui Zhen cried. Wei Cheng said, "You've suffered so much. It‚Äôs truly a bad idea. Love has harmed you. I brought Sister Cui Zhen home out of love, but it has caused her such pain." He firmly gripped Cui Zhen's hand tightly.

Second Mrs. Ye came straight in from outside, smiling, "I wondered where you two had disappeared to, so you're here. Oh, were you crying?" Cui Zhen and Wei Cheng wiped their eyes simultaneously and said, "No." Second Mrs. Ye, as Wei Cheng had guessed, was wearing her glasses. She walked to the table and smiled, "Did Wei Cheng bring this book? Studying is good, but why are you sad again? Are you discussing your matter face to face? It's better to talk face to face. What man doesn't marry a wife, and what woman doesn't marry a husband? You are no longer children." Wei Cheng laughed and said, "Sister Cui Zhen wants me to talk to Chen Guo Fang about marriage. That is really going far afield." Cui Zhen immediately interjected, "Yes, that's what I said. Second Aunt, please help persuade Brother Cheng. Brother Cheng is the only son of the Ye family. His matter is not just his own, but also concerns the future of the Ye family. I, a woman of little luck, am definitely not the person to shoulder this responsibility." Cui Zhen spoke these words openly and honestly, without any timidity or shyness. (217)
