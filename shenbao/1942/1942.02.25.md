Result of the Naval Battle in the South Seas: Japanese Ship Losses are Minimal

### World's Major Oceans Become Boundless Battlefields; Roosevelt Broadcast Speech Yesterday Afternoon: Prepared to Deal with These Difficulties

Washington, 24th – Reuters: President Roosevelt delivered a broadcast speech to the nation at 11 AM today (Shanghai time), stating in part: "If we were to withdraw our warships, aircraft, and merchant ships to our own territorial waters, as some have demanded, and focus solely on our final line of defense, then all our great reserves of strength in countries around the world would be cut off, and we would no longer be able to supply China with any military needs. If we were to stop transporting military supplies to the Mediterranean and the Persian Gulf to supply Britain and the Soviet Union, it would be tantamount to helping the German army rampage through Turkey, Syria, Iraq, Persia, Egypt, the Suez Canal, and the entire coast of Africa and West Africa. If we were to follow this stubborn policy and no longer defend the North Atlantic, the supply lines to Britain and Russia, then the Soviet counterattack against Germany would inevitably be thwarted, and Britain's food and military supplies would inevitably be cut off. Regarding the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7th of last year, although the impact was serious, it has been exaggerated. In that battle, 2,340 of our officers and men were killed and 946 were wounded. Some say that the war has already ended for Britain, and that the Soviet Union and China will also lay down their arms. All patriotic and sensible Americans should laugh at such absurd nonsense." The President then asked listeners to take out a map of the world to illustrate the relationship of the battle lines around the world in this war. The President said, "There are many questions that I am afraid I cannot answer, but I know that you must also understand that not all events can be included in one report. The oceans that once protected us have now become boundless battlefields. We must understand and prepare to deal with these difficulties, because our current task is to fight far away, to fight in all places around the globe. We must fight in these distant locations in order to protect our supply and transportation routes and communications with our allies. But there are still those among us who think in terms of the sailing ship era, advocating that our country's warships, aircraft, and merchant ships be recalled to our own country and concentrated entirely within our last line of trench defenses."

Production Plan in Drafting

Lisbon, 23rd – Domei: President Roosevelt frankly admitted in tonight's broadcast that an American victory in the near future is impossible. Regarding the Pacific, President Roosevelt said, "Our production of war materials can exceed Japan's, and defeat Japan," but he did not specify any concrete plans for the American side. President Roosevelt said, "Although the United States is helping allies including the Soviet Union and China, maintaining this supply line is a difficult task." In the final ten minutes, the President's speech was a review of the situation in the vast area of the current world war. He said that he knew that most Americans agreed on the need to continue to help allies and to fight enemies in distant lands. The President pointed out the difficulties facing the United States in completing this task. He acknowledged that these difficulties included the production of war materials, shipbuilding, and transportation. The President vowed to listeners that if this war is lost, America's freedom and democracy will be lost to the next generation. He listed three principles that Americans must adhere to during this war: 1. Continue to work, without a day of rest. 2. No one shall demand special rights. 3. Sacrifice personal convenience and freedom. At the same time, regarding the existence of labor difficulties, the President said that production must continue without interruption, and that he is drafting a plan to resolve labor disputes. Throughout the entire speech, President Roosevelt did not provide specific production figures.

### Inventor of the Airship, Parseval, Dies

The first semi-rigid airship he invented took off near Tegel, a suburb of Berlin, in 1906.

### Doomed Lovers: Famous Brazilian Writer Couple Commit Suicide by Poison

### Stalin's Address to Soldiers Does Not Mention Far East Situation

Moscow, 23rd – Havas: Yesterday was the 24th anniversary of the founding of the Red Army. Only Stalin issued an address to the Red Army soldiers. The Red Army General Headquarters did not issue a war bulletin on the front lines. No military parade was held in Red Square. However, the local radio station broadcasted more programs to stimulate patriotic sentiment and related to military affairs.

Stockholm, 23rd – Havas: Observers here are commenting on Stalin's address to Red Army soldiers yesterday, stating that the most noteworthy part is the passage reviewing the Soviet Union's war aims, roughly meaning that the Soviet Union does not want to destroy Germany, nor does it want to oppress the German people. The Soviet Union is only fighting to defend itself. This kind of argument will have a very important impact on soldiers about to launch a large-scale offensive. Secondly, Stalin also said, "The Soviet Union has not received foreign aid, while Italy, Finland, and Romania are assisting Germany in the war." This statement will also cause serious repercussions internationally. In addition, Stalin did not say a single word about the situation in the Far East, which is also extremely important and cannot be ignored.

### Northern Australian City Under Military Administration; New Zealand Representatives in Sydney to Discuss Strategy and Supply Issues

Canberra, 23rd – Havas: Australian Federal Army Minister Ford recently stated that northern Australia, including Darwin and several other cities, will be placed under military administration from today, but this does not mean the implementation of martial law.

Melbourne, 23rd – Havas: The Melbourne Herald recently published an article commenting on the bombing of Darwin, criticizing the authorities for their lack of action and inadequate preparations, stating that, due to Darwin's geographical location, it may have been difficult for authorities to issue an early warning, but it is incomprehensible why no warning was issued at all, given the complete reconnaissance methods and scientific equipment. Furthermore, officials admitted that several aircraft were destroyed on the ground. It is clear that our technicians failed to provide camouflage on the ground.

Sydney, 23rd – Havas: A New Zealand delegation, including Minister of Commerce and Industry Sullivan and Air Force Commander Goddard, arrived here today to discuss strategy and supply issues with Australian Federal Cabinet members.

Melbourne, 23rd – Havas: Reportedly, Japanese planes flew over Port Moresby in New Guinea yesterday for reconnaissance.

Hawaii Possible Target of Attack

Buenos Aires,

Argentina, 24th – Reuter: Former Commander of the U.S. Yangtze River Fleet, Rear Admiral Sterlin, published an article in New York, warning the American people that the Japanese army may attack Hawaii. He said, "We can no longer underestimate the Japanese army's combat power. We should keep in mind the Japanese army's determination to fight and its spirit of disregard for sacrifice. Hawaii is a very important target in the Pacific. If Hawaii is lost, then the gateway to America's Pacific coast will be wide open, and we will no longer have a springboard for future attacks. If the Japanese army's fortunes continue to be favorable, then the Japanese army may clear the Western Pacific. After this is completed, the Japanese army's combat power will be sufficient to attack Hawaii. Although we already know that Hawaii's defenses have been greatly strengthened since the Pearl Harbor attack, we do not know if it is sufficient." Sterlin concluded by calling for the United States to strengthen the island's air power.

Washington, 23rd – Havas: The War Department recently issued a war bulletin stating that Bataan was quiet in the past 24 hours, with both sides remaining inactive and artillery battles completely ceasing.

### On the Talents of Generals by Wavell (5)

In modern times, mere glory or spoils are difficult to use as enticement, not to mention that little glory or spoils can actually be obtained. Although awarding medals and promotions has some effect, if not carefully distributed, they are sufficient to incite resentment among officers and soldiers. Belief in doctrine can generate great power, especially after mass propaganda and indoctrination. However, the following words, taken from a book discussing the last Great War, remain true: "A soldier will not desert because of the irrationality of the war's purpose, nor will he advance straight ahead because of the righteousness of the doctrine he holds. Desertion is due to discouragement, victory is due to superior strength, or merely due to the leader's inspiration and confidence in victory." Throughout history, there have been many examples of soldiers displaying courage and valor due to their belief in their leaders. Whether this is possible in today's all-powerful state remains unknown.

But regardless of other countries, as far as the British army is concerned, the real root of the problem lies in tradition and discipline. Due to time constraints, I cannot discuss discipline in detail here. I can only say that due to national conscription (everyone participating in future wars will be a national soldier, even in Britain) and universal education, future discipline will inevitably differ from the traditional military discipline of the past. Since I joined the ranks, discipline has undergone significant changes, and continues to change. But no matter the system, the duty of a general is always to seek justice in all things. Soldiers are not afraid of strict military law, as long as it is implemented fairly and reasonably. For example, during the retreat to Corunna, a private criticized Craufurd in this way: "If he had flogged two men, he would have saved several hundred." Besides discipline, what soldiers pay most attention to is: first, their personal comfort—that is, regular rations, suitable clothing, good lodging, and adequate hospital facilities (in fact, it is to seek three meals a day and fair treatment); second, their personal safety—that is, wartime equipment sufficient to give them the greatest chance of victory and survival. In short, it's about artillery and butter. In the last Great War, the decline of Russian morale can be attributed to a lack of artillery; for Germany, it was a lack of butter.

A general who usually cares for his soldiers, ensuring they are well-clothed and well-fed, and who provides them with the necessary equipment in wartime to give them a chance to fight and win, will naturally gain the trust of the people. As to whether he can also gain the love of the people, that is another question. Wellington was most meticulous in managing deployments and affairs, and never lost a battle in his life, making him arguably the most successful general. But in fact, he never gained the love of his subordinates. Only once, when some troops were trapped in a difficult situation due to a miscalculation by his subordinates, did they spontaneously cheer when they saw Wellington arrive. Although Kitchener never tried to win over his subordinates in the hope of their love, he received the same cheers on the battlefield of Atbara. Marlborough, on the other hand, not only deployed meticulously and achieved remarkable military exploits, like Wellington and Kitchener, but also gained the love of his subordinates, who affectionately called him Corporal John. He also received great cheers from the troops on the battlefield of Ramillies. Buller, in the South African War, repeatedly suffered defeats, but never lost the love and trust of his subordinates. Hill, "Daddy," was a corps commander under Wellington: by nature, he was unrestrained, and every subordinate loved him, as his nickname suggests. But does it matter whether a general who has already gained the trust of his subordinates also gains their love? In fact, this can never be achieved by ingratiation. It is enough to gain the approval and respect of subordinates. Soldiers naturally expect their generals to be sharp and capable; when generals are mild-mannered, they often harbor doubts, wondering if it is sincere. Among famous generals, perhaps only Marlborough was naturally mild-mannered, without the slightest pretense.

In the modern army, soldiers hardly know their generals. For example, few of Haig's subordinates knew him, and Haig himself was a very taciturn man, who never casually interacted with his subordinates. In the past, in times of crisis, generals could lead by example, as Napoleon did at Lodi, and Lannes did at Ulm (at that time, he personally led the assault troops to attack again, and said to the crowd: "Before becoming a general, I was originally a grenadier!"). Byron has a poem describing an army suddenly regaining its morale because

A little old man, odd and quaint,
Bareheaded came to lead the fore.

This refers to that eccentric Russian genius, Suvorov. Such times are now a thing of the past. To find a similar example in modern times, I can only cite Haig in the First Battle of Ypres. At that time, due to the dire situation, after all the reserves had been sent to the front line, Haig also led several staff officers on horseback toward the Menin Road. Some may think this is a useless affectation; but such affectation is still appropriate for the time and place.

### The Strategic Importance of Burma

Since the fall of Singapore, the Pacific War has intensified in the direction of Burma and the Dutch East Indies. Rangoon was originally named Dagon, then renamed Raugoon. In 1825, it was renamed Rangoon. Rangoon society is complex, with diverse ethnicities and customs. Those bustling through the streets include people from various parts of India, various ethnic groups in Burma, Malays, Jews, and people from China, Japan, and Europe and America. It can be called a human exhibition. Indians are quite influential in the local business community. On the street, betel nut stalls or ice cream, rose milk cream, etc. are sold. The shops are also full of customers, so the narrow roads are very crowded. (See the diagram below). The largest river in Burma is the Irrawaddy River. To the east is the Salween River in eastern Burma. The Salween River occupies an important position in the current war situation. This river originates in western Kangding, China, and enters the sea to the left of Moulmein in Burma. (Pictured above) is a suspension bridge over the Salween River, paved with large stone slabs in the middle.

### Sluggish Spot Market, Businesses Gradually Liquidating, Brokers to be Banned in Various Industries

The city's entire industrial and commercial sector was previously affected by the manipulation of speculative merchants. Now, due to strict surveillance by the authorities, these people have exhausted their tricks. Therefore, the golden age of such speculative and illegal trading has passed. According to those familiar with the commercial market, it is said that in the future, all transactions in the city will be ordered to ban the system of brokers acting as intermediaries in various industries.

Commodity Price Hikes Still Unabated

Yesterday, it was learned that the buying and selling of goods has recently become less free than in the past. Because there is still no definite news about the release of large quantities of daily necessities, merchants are shifting their attention to manipulating various non-controlled goods, secretly raising prices. As a result, the prices of a portion of goods have recently risen quite sharply. In addition to soap, candles, and cigarettes, northern goods have risen by more than 10%, southern goods have risen by about 20%, and sugar has risen even more. And yesterday, the prices rose first and then fell, with quite large fluctuations.

Store Closures Increasing Daily

The city's commerce has not been as prosperous as in the past due to the impact of years of war. Recently, due to the decline in citizens' purchasing power, the spot market for various businesses is becoming increasingly sluggish, resulting in poor business performance. However, daily expenses are increasing, making it difficult to maintain operations. According to business circles, recently, in addition to a portion of stores having reduced their business scope and preparing to operate on a small scale, a small portion of businesses have closed down one after another and are liquidating their accounts due to financial constraints.

Difficult to Buy Rice, Unwilling to Continue Operating

Some stores have always provided meals for their employees, but because the number of employees is several times that of ordinary families, the monthly rice requirement exceeds one dan. Stores without rice reserves have no choice but to order their employees to go and buy government-priced rice in person. Even if they can accumulate one sheng of rice for each trip, it is necessary to mobilize a large number of employees to accomplish this, which affects business operations. It is to be expected that managers are troubled by the rice problem every day and are exhausted, and therefore unwilling to continue their operations. It is said that this phenomenon is very common.

### Using Iron to Break Open Walls, Attempting to Steal from a Warehouse

At around 2 a.m. yesterday morning, a theft occurred at the Huade Warehouse at 120 Renji Road. Four Chinese were arrested. The four Chinese thieves first used an iron bar and a very heavy iron hammer to dig a large hole in the wall of the warehouse.

Their intention was to remove all the iron bars on the window and then move the goods out of the window. Unexpectedly, a Chinese police officer on duty was patrolling the area and arrested all four people.

The HSBC Bank still handles applications and opening procedures for safe deposit boxes through the savings department. The procedures for declaring items and claiming them remain the same. However, few tenants have been going to claim their items in recent days. It is found that the bank has only 800 safe deposit boxes, which is far fewer than Mercantile Bank. Therefore, when it first opened, the number of people declaring and opening their boxes was not crowded.

No News Yet on Citibank Opening Boxes

The opening hours for safe deposit boxes at National City Bank of New York are still limited to 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. and 2 p.m. to 3 p.m. Tenants are still applying to open their boxes and claim their items in a steady stream.

### Gang of Criminals Apprehended in Murder of Xie Derong Case

Xie Derong, owner of the Shanghai Woodworking Company on Beijing Road, resided at No. 30, Lane 38, Meibaige Road. On the morning of the 3rd of this month at 7:30 a.m., several armed robbers broke into his home with the intention of robbing him. At the time, Xie resisted, resulting in the robbers opening fire with a pistol, hitting him in a vital area and killing him. Xie's wife, Mi, also suffered a gunshot wound to the neck. Seeing that they had caused a tragedy, the robbers did not dare to steal anything and fled through the door. Subsequently, the Xinzha Police Station received a report and ordered detectives to transport Xie's body to the morgue for examination. Meanwhile, Xie's wife was sent to the hospital for treatment. A few days ago, the police station's Chinese Deputy Detective Xue Minjie, detectives Ye Yushan, Ruan Yao, Xu Shutian, Cui Zhiliang, and others, successively arrested suspects Zhi Zijin, Zhao Jinkui, Mao Shungen, Yang Hongcheng, Gao Asheng, Wang Qinhang, Mei Yulong, and Shen Weishan in Room 4 of the Pingjiang Hotel on Yongan Street and Hubei Road in the French Concession.

After Zhang's death, his stepmother requested a division of the estate, but the lawsuit remains unresolved.

Since the implementation of Daylight Saving Time this month, the authorities in the French Concession have stipulated that the closing time for each vegetable market is 11 a.m. However, due to the cold spring weather, citizens have not abandoned the habit of getting up late. As the vegetable industry is restricted by time, the impact on business is very significant. Citizens who buy vegetables a little later are turned away, which is also very inconvenient. Furthermore, the services of the vegetable industry are all in the morning, which does not affect electricity consumption. Therefore, they collectively discussed yesterday and jointly applied to the Municipal Council to extend the business hours of each vegetable market.

### Lured by High Profits, Tricking Large Sums of Money, Arrested

Karl Gumbert, a German Jew residing at No. 71, Lane 305, Gongping Road, operates as an electrical appliance broker. He set up an office in Room 438 at No. 131 Museum Road. From August 28th to December 13th of last year, he told his neighbor, SStun, that Sincere Company and other electrical appliance companies had commissioned him to purchase a large quantity of electrical appliances, and after calculating the cost of 170 yuan each, he could obtain a huge profit of 330 yuan. However, he lacked capital, so he intended to cooperate with him. At that time, SStun believed it to be true and agreed to advance the capital. As a result, Karl successively obtained 11,813 yuan from SStun. However, Karl has not yet returned the advanced funds or paid any profits. As a result, suspicion arose, and he inquired with the so-called Sincere Company and other companies and found that they had not commissioned Karl to purchase electrical materials. Only then did he realize that he had been deceived and reported it to the Central Police Station. After investigation by Western Detective Ohm and Chinese Detective Wu Chunrong, it was confirmed to be true. Karl was arrested the day before yesterday and taken back to the police station to await investigation and verification.

### Letter to the Editor

To the Editor: Today, your newspaper reported the news of the Fufeng Flour Mill laying off employees, and the part concerning Xiaoshui is quite inaccurate. It has been verified that the factory's dismissal of employees was entirely handled by the factory authorities, and Xiaoshui never intervened. It was actually Mr. Sun Boqun, the factory director of our factory, who, in accordance with the intentions of the concession authorities, considered the livelihood of the employees and sought to cut costs. Mr. Sun's original intention was only to lay off a portion of the workers, about 300 people, but some of those who had served in the factory for a long time and were already old voluntarily requested to be laid off with compensation. As for the staff, they were put on unpaid leave. This is due to the environmental conditions, so both labor and management can understand. This was not due to Xiaoshui's efforts. Therefore, I am writing to clarify the facts and request a correction. Respectfully, Wang Xiaoshui

### Foreign Stocks Continue to Decline, Domestic Bonds Slightly Increase

In the over-the-counter market for public bonds yesterday, prices continued to strengthen slightly, with various bonds rising by two to four cents. This slight increase is not yet a formal upward trend, as anxiety remains strong and the market continues to struggle with uncertainty. While there are investors buying, sellers continue to release spot goods, which fails to boost market sentiment. Before the official announcement of the winning numbers for Type A bonds, it is feared that the market cannot escape its depressed state. Companies such as Shuntai, Tongkang, Dahua, and Xie Kang are actively buying, while Xinhua, Zhenchang, Yi Yu, Lianyi, Hu Heji, and Houda are actively selling. Type C bonds opened at $68.30, rose to $68.50, then fell back to $68.10. Later, a large investor suddenly bought heavily, pushing the price back up to $68.80, but it closed down slightly at $68.60. This shows that the effort is twice the result, and it is not easy to rise. As a result, except for Type D bonds, which did not change, the rest continued to rise by two to four cents, but the upward trend was quite labored. The total turnover was approximately $400,000. A summary table is listed below.

### Uncertainty Reigns, Cash Sycee Rises Then Slightly Falls

Yesterday, the over-the-counter market for cash sycee initially continued to rise, then fell slightly. The $14,000 mark was difficult to break through, so Sheng Dayong first emerged with Shenchang to push it up, followed by Cash Bank. People were uncertain, waiting for news of the war on the Burma Road. Trading was slow. In the morning, each bar (10 taels) initially opened quite strong at $13,600, which was $300 higher. A certain gold shop once took in 10 taels from customers, with the lowest being $13,520. Sheng Da, Yong Tongkang, Yong He Fa, Shenchang, Xinfeng Yong, and retail investors strongly pushed up the price, gradually rising by $480 to the $14,000 mark. There were only one or two transactions at this price, and sellers with limit orders emerged. Sheng Da Yong re-emerged, and Shun Yuan Cheng Ji and Yong Feng Yu gold shops sold off. The market weakened at noon, falling by $350. The noon close was $13,650, which was $350 higher than the previous day's closing price. After the close, there were sellers at the above price.

### Yarn Prices Fluctuate

The opening price of 20-count Shuangma factory yarn was $2,100, rising to $2,140. After a short while, due to the enthusiasm of suppliers, the market weakened, and the price gradually fell to $2,050.

The factory cloth market was stable yesterday, with actual sales in the street being relatively brisk, with coarse cloth, Shilin cloth, white-ground floral cloth, bleached cloth, and poplin being the most popular. Other goods that did not suit the market were less popular, so sales varied. 16-pound coarse cloth Huadie was at $125.50, Yongzi was at $105, 14-pound Yilu was at $104, Yongzi was at $95.50, 8-pound Zhenzhong was at $62.50, Dapeng fine cloth was at $98, Baimao floral cloth was at $92.50, 190 Taohua women's Shilin cloth was at $165, Magnolia bleached cloth was at $105, Dayuan fine twill was at $80.

Eastern cloth rebounded yesterday due to strong buying interest from local customers. 12-pound Longtou fine cloth factory orders opened at $109 and gradually rose to $111. Retail investors sold off, and the price fell back to $109.50. At the close, buying interest from the industry was strong, pushing the price up to $110.02.5, an increase of $2.75 per piece compared to the previous day.

Sijunzi Serge fluctuated between $3.589 between October and December, but orders from July to September remained weak at only $3.41.

### Spring and Summer Woolens Are Firm and Popular

The woolen market has been tense since the beginning of the New Year. Opening prices have been strong, with all goods increasing, and holders are hoarding, only willing to sell four or five boxes out of ten boxes of goods, unwilling to sell them all, with most expecting further price increases. Spring thin tweeds and summer white goods are even more firm and popular. Palise normal is opening at $456 per yard, Yihua's 135 tweed is opening at $656, the Japanese factory's 456 tweed is opening at $445, Yinfeng's 101 thin plain serge is opening at $53, Dalong gabardine is opening at $59, imported goods feather yarn and Wanli top are opening at $756, Fengyu white serge is opening at $856, Sanjiang Lanling beige is opening at $389, snow white is opening at $423. Due to high prices and shortages, Yuanbao business is less than in previous years.

### Miscellaneous Grains Prices Soar

The miscellaneous grains market soared yesterday, with all grains rising sharply. This is due to the long delays in supply and the depletion of grain reserves, as well as reports of sharp price increases in the interior, which led to strong buying from stores. Various coarse grains rose first, followed by other grains. As a result, red beans and tea beans both rose by $10-20, yellow beans and broad beans rose by $3-5, and bean cakes rose by $2-3, all setting new records. The unified market opened with over 400 packages of Tianjin Jinyuan, priced at $162-164, 160 packages of Pudong Du beans, priced at $149, one carload of Wuhu soybeans, priced at $145, 200 packages of Chongming sand yellow, priced at $138-140, and 400 packages of sand red, priced at $125-130, 100 packages of Ben Niu red beans, priced at $119-120, 60 packages of Pinghu red beans, priced at $125, 30 packages of Chongming sand silkworm, priced at $80, over 100 packages of Wujiang green silkworm, priced at $88-92, two carloads of Mingguang red grain, priced at $70-73, and old goods at $66, over 100 packages of Qingdao foreign raw kernels, priced at $295, 100 packages of Tianjin raw kernels, priced at $240, 50 packages of Nanjing white hemp, priced at $200, 30 packages of Guan Dian white sesame, priced at $196, 4,000 pieces of Shen Ji bean cake, with May warehouse receipts priced at $32.50-34, and June warehouse receipts priced at $33-35, 5,000 pieces of Hankou bean cake, priced at $25-26, one carload of Fei bean cake, with November warehouse receipts priced at $35.

Bran has not been selling well domestically, and yesterday there were still hoarders rushing to buy, and the rising trend was particularly severe. Sanxin opened at $64 in the morning and then rose from $64.70 to $65, $65.50, to $66, a sharp increase of $2, and 3,000 packages were traded. This is because there is a need in the domestic feed market, so the appetite is very greedy.

### Rice Prices Rebound

The national rice market has been closed for two days, and the amount of rice arriving in two days is not enough to meet the consumption for one day. Therefore, people's expectations are rising, and market prices are soaring. In particular, the continuous heavy rain has made the roads muddy, and the supply from the four townships near Shanghai has been blocked. Especially the early and late rice from the south have seen the most intense price increases, rising by more than $10 compared to last Saturday. The price of northern japonica rice has been high, but there has been supply, but it has also been driven up by $5-6. Early rice is selling at $261-258, late rice at $262-259, northern japonica at $285-280, and second-grade futures at $270. Yuan rice is out of stock and has not opened. The future market is expected to be good, but rice prices are rising higher and higher, and the quality of rice is getting worse and worse.

### Hoarding of Cigarettes Increasing Daily

Cigarette inventories are dwindling, and buying prices are soaring. Those who hold the goods are hoarding, so the rising trend in the market is difficult to contain. Yesterday, the market opened with Great Britain brand cigarettes as high as $8,500 per carton, Old Knife brand at $7,600, Wuhua brand at $4,700, Little Fairy brand at $4,800, Pinhai brand at $7,100, Japanese cigarettes Golden Gun brand at $1,760, Golden Building at $2,000.

In ancient times—the exact year is difficult to determine—the tangerine varieties that were transmitted from China to Japan also included the so-called "Wenzhou Mandarin Orange," which is very different from the European oranges of Wenzhou in our country today; there were also varieties such as "Jin Nian Jiu Mu," "Da Naruto," "Jin Naruto," etc. As for the "Snow Orange" variety, it has a soft texture, abundant juice, and a sweet and delicious taste, making it the best and most famous among Japanese varieties. As for the "Siamese Mandarin Orange" that Shanghai people are accustomed to, its juice is abundant and its taste is sweet, and it is also a very excellent variety; however, when it was transmitted from China, and when Kyoto first cultivated it, are probably both impossible to determine the year.

Now, putting aside the conditions of citrus production in Africa, Australia, and many other islands, let's just say a few words about the products of the famous California in the United States, which Shanghai people call "Flag Oranges." Not long after the discovery of the New World in 1492 AD, the Portuguese transplanted orange trees to the West Indies, so within a century of the discovery of the Americas, there were already records of this plant; and the southern United States, especially the hot California on the western coast of the Pacific Ocean, naturally became an ideal paradise for cultivating orange trees. Moreover, Americans have used modern technology, patience, and perseverance to improve the varieties of orange trees and increase their production, and the results have been extraordinarily successful! So by the end of the nineteenth century, its products had already become a sensation, with large quantities being exported to the United Kingdom or elsewhere; now it has surpassed the old continent's citrus production area! Even the old-fashioned China is becoming more popular. Indeed, we Chinese are a bit too conservative: if we don't want to be content to be eliminated and always lag behind others in the future, we should try to catch up. (To be continued)

### The Solution to the Housing Rent Problem

— Xiang Zhi

The housing rent problem in Shanghai is also considered a great deficiency by the citizens. It used to be a big mess, and the authorities paid great attention to it. Now, more concrete measures will be implemented. The Public Concession has decided to limit the rent charged by subletters to subtenants within the concession from the first of next month, so that the profits meet the standards and do not make it impossible for ordinary people to breathe. This method is reasonable.

This can also slightly curb the arrogance of the subletters. Although the subletters have already established their existing situation, if the measures are effectively implemented, it is unlikely that they will be as arrogant as before.

Subletters shall not exceed 20% of the rent and police donation fees, water and electricity bills paid to the main landlord. The question is, how many of the subletters in Shanghai in the past could be kind enough not to exceed this limit? This new business, apart from food and expenses, clears all expenses, and most of them have at least double the original rent. In the past, it was indeed the world of subletters, but now it can be considered "the wheel of fortune has turned," and they will also be silent.

If the relationship between the subletters and the subtenants is usually harmonious, I think the subtenants should "be lenient wherever possible," why be so calculating, and even calculate old accounts. If their own financial ability is still manageable; if the subletters were too arrogant in the past, they would find a way to ease their breath.

Indeed, it is not as easy as before for subletters to sublet the house to others, but this kind of "business," "two cents" can still be obtained, why not do it.

### Is It "Generosity at the Expense of Others"?

— Xin Kui

No matter how careful a person is, they may sometimes lose things. Where someone loses something, someone will definitely find it. Some people, after finding a lost item, do not report it to the police station or the autonomous organization, but directly send a letter to the newspaper to announce it and seek the owner, and at the same time, they limit the owner to come to the specified place to pick it up within a certain number of days, otherwise they will donate the item to charity.

The finder has no intention of possessing the lost item, and hopes that the owner can retrieve the original item, and will only transfer the lost item to charity after the deadline has passed. Such behavior seems to be frank and chivalrous to the extreme; such people are already very rare in this turbulent world; therefore, when newspapers receive such letters, they often do not hesitate to use space and are happy to publish them on their behalf.

However, according to legal regulations, before the ownership of an item has been determined, it seems that one cannot make special arrangements for the item without authorization, so to donate the lost item to a charitable organization, one should first obtain the ownership of the item. To obtain the ownership of the lost item, one must wait six full months after the announcement and no one claims it. Usually, the deadline set by the finder is only one or two weeks, and the shortest is only three days, and it is rare for the deadline to be longer than a month; as for six months, it is almost absolutely not.

Setting the deadline for claiming lost items so short is excessively neglecting the interests of the owner. Moreover, to do good deeds, one must dig into one's own pocket, and before the lost item can legally be considered one's own, it is already being taken to do good deeds. Isn't that generosity at the expense of others? If the deadline set by the finder has passed, but the statutory six months have not yet arrived, and the lost item has already been donated, and the owner finds out and investigates according to law, then wouldn't this finder have to pay a heavy price instead?

Editor's Note: If you find a lost item and stuff it into your own pocket, this is certainly not a "gentleman," and it naturally violates the law; if you find something and announce it to claim it, it is not necessarily an expedient measure, and can be called ancient morality; as for arbitrarily setting a deadline for claiming it, there is a legal issue, which is another question. "The law is nothing more than human sentiment," people cannot always "wait for the rabbit"; if the time is extended, then it will be even more meritorious. I ask for your opinion, what do you think?

### Stage and Screen

During this year's Spring Festival, filmmakers Lv Yuzhen, etc., jointly performed Zhou Qi's "The Tragic History of the Pear Garden" and Zheng Bi's "Fantasy" at the Xuan Gong Theater, which was well received by the audience. It is said that a second performance will be held soon, and the script has been announced as Tan Zhengbi's new "Poet Wu Meicun," directed by Mu Niyun.

Tan Zhengbi has recently been quite inclined to writing plays. In addition to "Plum Blossom Dream" and "Poet Wu Meicun," he recently wrote a 16-act historical satirical tragicomedy called "The Three Yang Sisters." Borrowing from the deeds of ancient people, it is aimed at a profound satire of modern society, and it is bound to cause a sensation among the audience when performed. It is said that the writer, in order to be cautious, will carefully revise it before the troupe performs it.

### Copying the Target

— Liu Shen

Police officers inspect suspicious pedestrians. Shanghai people pass it down by word of mouth, and it is used in writing, saying: "Copying the target." Literally, the person being copied is not a person, but a target. According to the definition, a target is the goal of target practice, and it is extremely insulting to call a person a target! Some people meet police officers checking on the road and tell their family that they happened to encounter copying the target, but they do not know what they have become, which is both lamentable and ridiculous.

### Sharing a Boat in Wind and Rain

— He Jia Zhi

(I) An Evening of Wind and Rain

Guoqi grasped Weicheng's hand, two hands grasped two hands, and asked, "Why aren't you, not saying anything? Get on our boat, we'll take you back, okay? Anyway, our boat is going to pass by Huagang." Only then did Weicheng calm down and replied, "Alright, it's just that I've already booked Zhang Shurong's boat in Huagang." As soon as he said this, the boat lurched, and a white-bearded man peered in from the canvas cabin door, smiling, "Young Master Ye, the tide is coming in, we're about to set sail, please come aboard. Zhang Shurong has already laid out the cleanest quilt for Young Master Ye, Young Master Ye can just have a warm and cozy sleep, and tomorrow morning, you'll be at the Shidetang residence." Guoqi waved his hand and said, "Young Master Ye is taking our boat, you can go your own way, boatman." Weicheng smiled and said, "Really, this Young Master Chen is my old classmate, I didn't expect to meet him here, we have a lot to talk about. Zhang Shurong, here's five dollars: three dollars is for your cabin fare, and two dollars is to compensate you for the paper umbrella, we'll see you again in Huagang tomorrow."

After seeing Zhang Shurong off, Guoqi's boatman told Guoqi from the back cabin that they were ready to set sail. Guoqi said, "Whenever we arrive at Huagang, you stop the boat for me and let this Mr. Ye ashore." After Guoqi finished speaking, he turned around and said, "I only let them call you Mr. Ye, those feudal-minded young masters and old masters are all being eliminated, what do you say? Haha." Weicheng smiled and said, "You can abolish young masters as much as you like, but you can't abolish young ladies, and I'll be so bold as to ask, who is this young lady?" The woman sitting upright in the middle cabin, although sitting upright, her expression was always lively. Hearing Weicheng say this, she had the opportunity to speak, first giving a very charming smile, and said, "Brother, this gentleman has arrived, why don't you introduce us?" Guoqi clapped his hands and said, "I'm happily crazy, I forgot to introduce him. But now that she's said it, I don't need to introduce him anymore, she calls me brother, so Weicheng will surely know what our relationship is. Weicheng, take another look at our faces." (V)

### Ankang

— Ze Fu

People in Hangzhou call Tanhuang [a type of local opera] Ankang, and some think it's a transliteration of Tanhuang (Supplement to the Remaining Customs of Hangzhou). Chen Diefan believes that Southern lyrics and Northern tunes were originally named after places, such as Yue tune, Qinqiang, as well as Kunqu and Huizhou tunes, which are the most obvious examples, and Pi Huang [Peking Opera] is the same. The two characters "Ankang" are actually the names of two places, Lin'an and Jiankang. The Southern Song Dynasty moved its capital to Lin'an, which was inherited from Jiankang (Preface to the Ankang Elegant Gathering). I, however, think the former saying is more reasonable, and its origin must have evolved from mountain Su Tan, hence the roles are also divided into male, female, and comedic roles, usually with five people in a group; the musical instruments are also string instruments, pipa, erhu, and clapper board; (in the Tongzhi period, gongs and drums were used, but now they are not.) The scripts sung are mostly adaptations of Kunqu tunes, such as Encouraging Agriculture, Making Peace, and Visiting the Hometown, with each line usually having seven characters. When singing, there are day shifts, Yin-Yang shifts, candle shifts, night shifts, and flower candle shifts. Those who sing during the day are day shifts, those who sing half the night are Yin-Yang shifts, those who start singing in the afternoon until the lights are lit are candle shifts, those who sing at night are night shifts, and those who sing until dawn are flower candle shifts. Each performance is limited to eight scenes, which are often used. Among them, the most prestigious was Feng Kui, who could write his own plays, and most of the plays performed today were written by him, or revised by him.

### The Pastime of Taking a Walk

— Ren Nian

Smart humans know how to invent automobiles and how to utilize machinery; but it's a pity that they have forgotten the inherent beauty of nature and the simple, unrefined appreciation! This is a very regrettable fact, although we cannot deny it, it is difficult to find one person out of a hundred who knows how to appreciate taking a walk. They are like a cog in the wheel of a machine, being nervously rotated all day long; they have long forgotten the beauty of nature. Taking a walk, the most basic of movements, although very easy to do, contains a transcendent spiritual comfort. No matter where or when, as long as we are happy, we can appreciate our harmonious pace and the unified spiritual aspiration of our mind and body.

In this noisy city, if you want to relax your tense nerves and obtain transcendent spiritual comfort, taking a walk will satisfy your desire, as long as you know how to appreciate the following points when you step onto the road:

From the very beginning, we should not have a fixed destination when taking a walk, following your mood to wherever your feet lead you, "When the mountains and rivers are exhausted and there seems to be no road, there is a village with bright flowers and lush willows," this is a meaningful picture, although bright flowers and lush willows are not easily seen in the city.

Secondly, taking a walk is not like playing chess or going to the movies, requiring prior arrangement or preparation: like an unintentional smile, let the mood for taking a walk gently drift through your idle heart. You are reading or working, and if the thought of taking a walk accidentally runs into your realm of thought, then you should follow this thought, open your door, and run out into the street to understand reality.

Finally, the most important point, and also the most difficult to achieve, is to leave all your personal troubles behind when taking a walk. In our daily work, especially when things are not going well, we are suffocated by troubles and disappointments all day long. When taking a walk, you should temporarily put these disappointments aside, otherwise, when you return tired from your walk, the heavy weight of these disappointments will be even heavier than what you felt before the walk. You should say: "In this moment, I will step into a world of comfort." In this state of mind, relax your thoughts, and then harmoniously release your pace.

### Not Preaching

— Wu Ren

I don't remember when or where I saw a painting, with two archways arranged on the left and right, one titled "The Path to Good," and the other labeled "The Gate of Evil." The path to good looked very narrow, and there were very few people walking on it. But those crowded at the gate of evil were numerous, and that road was very wide and flat. But far away at the end of the two roads, each stood a wooden sign, the one above the small path was written with "Heaven," and the other one was "Hell."

Needless to say, the painting was made by a preacher to promote good deeds. How effective it was and how many people converted to religion because of it is unknown. But it caught my attention at the time, leaving a deep impression, and I still think about it all the time. This is a fact. The greatest meaning of this painting is to indicate to people that the path to good is narrow and difficult, and those who walk it must have patience, perseverance, and courage. If you can overcome all difficulties, you will eventually reach the realm of light.

A person living in the real world must be more serious in dealing with things, otherwise, if you are careless and confused, in the end, society will still ruthlessly eliminate you.
