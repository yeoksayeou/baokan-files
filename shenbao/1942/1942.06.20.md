### Japan Refreshes Administrative Organs

Tokyo, 19th, Allied News Agency Dispatch: In order to actively promote the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, the Japanese government, while establishing a new system in the political world, aims to ensure the sufficiency of necessary personnel in various southern regions. Therefore, it is implementing the refreshing of administrative organs to make administrative efficiency simpler and more effective. At the same time, it will mobilize surplus officials to various southern regions. This policy was decided in the previous cabinet meeting and specific methods were determined. Today, at the regular cabinet meeting, the heads of each intelligence bureau presented explanations, which were fully approved. The main points of the intelligence bureau's announcement are as follows: The key points of this plan for simplifying and strengthening administrative organs are roughly: Reduce officials in each government office, taking June 1st as the standard, to refresh affairs and simplify the structure. After this, except for those approved by the cabinet, no personnel may be increased or supplemented. The rate of reduction of officials is 30% for central agencies, 20% for local agencies, and 10% for technical agencies. The same standard applies overseas. Study and improve the treatment policy to meet needs.

### The Oriental Daily Commentary on the Japan-Thailand Agreement

Tokyo, 19th, Allied News Agency Dispatch: As the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere progresses steadily, it is essential for the countries of East Asia to exchange goods and cooperate closely. Therefore, the establishment of the Japan-Thailand loan has profound and significant meaning for the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. On the 19th, editorials in local newspapers unanimously praised this. For example, the "Asahi Shimbun" stated that after Thailand severed relations with Britain and the United States, its funds were frozen, which caused economic turmoil in Thailand. The establishment of this Japan-Thailand loan not only resolves this problem satisfactorily, but also has good effects on the survival of both countries and the expansion of the entire economy of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The "Hochi Shimbun" stated that the establishment of this Japan-Thailand loan agreement not only benefits Thailand, but also tightens Japan-Thailand economic relations and lays a solid foundation for the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, so its meaning is actually very significant.

### Dutch Harbor Oil Depot Hit by Bomb and Catches Fire, Burning for Several Days

Stockholm, Sweden, 18th, Allied News Agency Dispatch: Regarding the riot in Sindh Province, India, a dispatch from Lisbon states that although the British army and police have made every effort to suppress the riot, it is becoming more rampant due to the advocacy of independence by Indians abroad and the influence of Gandhi, Nehru, and others' statements that the British must withdraw from India, etc. It is reported that thousands of Furey tribesmen have been arrested, but they are not discouraged and their morale is high. They have begun to move towards the state of Chiputanara, and it seems that they will attack the state's military center, Kaisa Luma. At present, the riot situation in various parts of the state is like wildfire, unstoppable. Because the area is a barren desert hills, the desert people are using the terrain, using camels and horses as desert tanks, launching elusive guerrilla warfare, and constantly advancing eastward. The British authorities are completely helpless in the face of this.

### Old Currency to be Prohibited from Circulation Sequentially, Mr. Zhou Fohai's Remarks, to be Implemented First in Nanjing and Shanghai

Central News Agency News: Regarding the issue of prohibiting the circulation of old currency, Mr. Zhou Fohai made the following remarks yesterday: There are only two days left until the deadline for exchanging old currency. After the deadline, areas will be designated, and the circulation of old currency will be prohibited sequentially in phases. I have stated this repeatedly. The government is currently drafting the necessary laws and regulations on this matter, and will implement them first in Nanjing and Shanghai (including the two special zones). Within a few days after the exchange deadline, a decree will be promulgated and implemented. After the prohibition of circulation of old currency, if there are still those in the area who use old currency as currency for mutual payment, once discovered, in addition to confiscating all of the old currency they used, they will also be given appropriate punishment. The degree of punishment is still under consideration. As for the purpose of this prohibition of circulation of old currency, although it is only to prohibit the people from using old currency as currency, since old currency cannot be circulated and used, it is really of no benefit for the people to hold old currency, which is tantamount to abandoning their own property. Therefore, I deeply hope that they will quickly exchange for new legal tender during the exchange period.

### Development Status of Industry in New Guinea

Tokyo, 19th, Central News Agency: According to a telegram from a certain base in the South Seas, Mr. Matsuda Sadanobu, advisor to the former Dutch West New Guinea Civil Affairs Department, arrived there by plane on the 18th to discuss important matters. According to the conversation, the development status of important industries in New Guinea and other places is as follows: Security on the former Dutch East Indies Outer Islands has been restored and has entered the construction phase. The rich underground resources, forestry, and general industries will be gradually investigated and developed, and the progress is quite smooth. In terms of underground resources, attention is paid to the development of oil fields, coal mines, and timber in New Guinea. The oil field near Bavo in the northern part of the island is rich in reserves and has been secretly developed by the Dutch New Guinea Petroleum Development Company. Most of the island's oil fields have not yet been mined, and their output and raw materials rank first in the world. In addition, the phosphorus ore resources near Maroguaya Li, the capital of New Guinea, have been exploited and have great prospects for the future. Our survey team is currently conducting investigations in Bavo Maroguaya Li, enduring hardships. Because the area is a dense forest wetland, located under the equator, our survey team braved the invasion of miasma and was finally able to complete the task. The local residents, the Papua Aiyi, have a good impression of the Japanese army, either guiding the Japanese army or helping to saw down the dense forest. They also cooperate in other restoration work. Other resources, such as livestock, cotton, edible oil, spices, and agricultural resources in Timor Island, Danibar Island, and Halmahera Island, are extremely rich. In order to mobilize materials within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, preparations have been made for development.

### Polang is Willing to Cooperate with Japan to the End

Tokyo, 19th, Allied News Agency Dispatch: A telegram from Polang states that Polang is in the southern part of the former Dutch Celebes, the only land ruled by a queen. A reporter followed the survey team to the Marili Mine north of Lonyi Bay. On the way to Polang, they had the opportunity to meet the Queen of Polang. The reporter asked about her hopes for the regeneration of Asia. She replied as follows: I am willing to be under Japanese rule. The residents are quite satisfied with the current situation. There is no shortage of materials, and a bumper harvest is expected this autumn. During the Dutch rule, they used Indonesians to discriminate against us in everything. We deeply know that if we do not cooperate with Japan in the future, our true happiness cannot be found. In the war, no matter how difficult the situation, we will cooperate with Japan to the end.

### Churchill Suddenly Arrives in Washington, Meets with Roosevelt Again to Discuss Various Issues Related to Operations, British Chief of the General Staff Brooke and Others Accompany Him

Buenos Aires, Argentina, 19th, Allied News Agency Dispatch: According to news from Washington, White House Secretary Oley announced to the press yesterday afternoon that British Prime Minister Churchill arrived at the White House yesterday and is scheduled to hold his first meeting with President Roosevelt tonight. This is the second time that Prime Minister Churchill has visited the United States in half a year since the United States entered the war. Those who came with him this time include important figures such as British Army Chief of Staff General Brooke and Major General Ismay, Secretary of the British-American Staff Team. Churchill's trip is as secret as the last time. The content discussed may be related to the opening of the second battlefield in Europe.

Washington, 18th, Havas News Agency Dispatch: British Prime Minister Churchill arrived here on the 18th and immediately visited President Roosevelt to discuss various issues related to the war. It is heard that the two politicians are scheduled to hold their first meeting at the White House tonight (2:00 PM Shanghai Summer Time on the 19th). British Air Force Chief of Staff General Brooke and Major General Ismay, Secretary-General of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the British Army, Navy, and Air Force, also came with him.

London, 19th, Havas News Agency Dispatch: Prime Minister Churchill's trip to the United States was kept strictly confidential in advance. Since the outbreak of the war, this is the third time that Churchill has gone abroad to hold meetings with President Roosevelt. As for General Brooke, who is traveling with the Prime Minister, he is 58 years old and has served as Chief of Staff since November 1941.

Stockholm, Sweden, 19th, Haitong News Agency Dispatch: After the news of Prime Minister Churchill's visit to the United States was released, people in Washington felt great interest. When Vincent, Chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee, was asked about this, he replied that Roosevelt would discuss very important issues with Churchill, and the possibility of opening a second battlefield might be discussed. Keen observers pointed out that the news of Churchill's visit to the United States can divert the attention of the general military. There have been many comments on the changes in the Libyan war and the British authorities' news policy. Now that Churchill's visit to the United States has been heard, the focus of the discussion will be shifted. A document from London stated that the Prime Minister arrived in Washington with British Chief of the General Staff Sir Brooke, but US news stated that Churchill would soon hold negotiations with Roosevelt.

### Various Parties Speculate on the Mission of Churchill's Trip

Washington, 19th, Havas News Agency Dispatch: What is the real intention of British Prime Minister Churchill's visit here? It is now the focus of discussion among the general public here. According to White House Secretary Oley, President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill will discuss war strategies and ways to win. The general public believes that this is a platitude and that its meaning is vague, which is not enough to satisfy public opinion. Various parties have been speculating about Prime Minister Churchill's trip. One of the most popular theories is that Churchill's visit to the United States is closely related to Soviet Foreign Commissar Molotov's visit to the United States. After Molotov's visit to the United States was completed, the British and American countries announced their intention to open a second battlefield, and this issue may be the focus of discussion between Prime Minister Churchill and President Roosevelt. In addition, Churchill's trip is accompanied by many senior British military officers, which shows that military issues are more important than political and diplomatic issues. Another group believes that various serious difficulties have forced Prime Minister Churchill to visit the United States again. For example, the war situation in Libya has caused anxiety in some quarters, and the Soviet Union's position is also unclear. Optimistic and pessimistic views are mixed. Moreover, as a result of enemy submarine activities, Allied merchant ships have suffered heavy losses, which is also an important issue at the moment.

Stockholm, Sweden, 19th, Haitong News Agency Dispatch: A Haitong News Agency reporter has recently learned from well-informed sources in neutral countries that it was Soviet Foreign People's Commissar Molotov who urged Churchill to visit the United States for the second time. It is heard that after Molotov returned to Europe from the United States, he met with Churchill in London and strongly urged the British Prime Minister to personally step forward and urge Roosevelt to take more active and effective measures. It is rumored that Churchill stated to Molotov that the opening of a second battlefield would be conditional on the United States quickly sending a large number of troops to participate in the war. It is heard that Roosevelt revealed to Molotov that the United States' ships, artillery, and tanks were not enough for a large-scale expedition. It is unknown whether Molotov informed Churchill of this situation.

Lisbon, 19th, Allied News Agency Dispatch: Churchill's visit to the United States is enough to show the extreme anxiety of the United Nations. According to Reuters, the central topics of this meeting are: How to launch the second front? How to replenish the lack of ships? How to reverse the defeats in East Asia and North Africa? How to strengthen US material assistance to Britain and the Soviet Union? However, according to diplomatic circles here, the alliance between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union has indicated that they are trapped in the abyss of fighting Germany, and there are no effective measures to deal with the defeats in East Asia. As for the so-called opening of the second front, it not only requires huge military supplies and a large number of ships, but also must face enormous dangers, so it is difficult to expect it to be realized quickly. Therefore, this meeting is only to study how to increase US production to strengthen assistance to Britain and the Soviet Union and to remedy the shortage of ships. According to this, this meeting is not worth paying attention to.

### Soviet Supreme Council Approves Anglo-Soviet Treaty; Molotov Reports on Trip Abroad

Moscow, 19th (Allied News Agency) – The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union yesterday approved the Anglo-Soviet Treaty. At the meeting, Foreign Commissar Molotov first reported on his visit to London and Washington.

Moscow, 18th (Allied News Agency) – The Supreme Provisional Soviet Union held a meeting at the Kremlin on the evening of the 18th. Stalin and other key government figures attended. Foreign Minister Molotov gave a detailed report on the conclusion of the Anglo-Soviet Military Treaty and the US-Soviet Economic Agreement. He stated that, as a result of the conclusion of this agreement, the US credit loan to the Soviet Union has increased from 1 billion gold yuan to 3 billion yuan. Furthermore, as a result of discussions with British and American leaders, complete agreement has been reached on the establishment of a second front in Europe this year.

Moscow, 18th (Havas News Agency) – In his report to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Molotov strongly stated that the Soviet Union has not concluded any secret clauses with the United States or the United Kingdom. As for Article 5 of the Anglo-Soviet Treaty and the principles established regarding the post-war European organization, there is absolutely nothing suspicious. The Soviet Union has never had any territorial ambitions or demands in Europe, Asia, or even within Iran, neither in the past nor in the future. Moreover, this principle is entirely consistent with the statement made by Supreme Defense Commissar Stalin on November 6, 1941. The negotiations I conducted in London and Washington, especially the agreement on opening a second front in Europe and intensifying the supply of military materials to the Soviet Union, are of utmost importance, he said. Stockholm, Sweden, 19th (Reuter’s Agency) – A report from Moscow states that Foreign Commissar Molotov delivered a speech at a special meeting of the Soviet Supreme Committee yesterday, requesting the United States and Britain to step up aid to the Soviet Union. It is said that the Anglo-Soviet Treaty is extremely important and will be submitted to the Supreme Committee for review and approval. Mr. Molotov then read aloud the important points of the treaty and elaborated on Anglo-Soviet relations. He then discussed British and American aid to the Soviet Union, stating that the Soviet Union must contend with Germany. Although Britain and the United States have shipped large quantities of war equipment to the Soviet Union, unfortunately many ships have been sunk by German naval and air forces en route. After personally negotiating with British and American authorities during this trip to Washington and London, Britain and the United States have agreed to intensify aid to the Soviet Union in the second half of the year. The discussion covered a wide range of topics, the most important of which was the opening of the second front. The relationship between the Soviet Union and the United States will further improve in the future. This agreement can only be regarded as the preliminary work for establishing a broader agreement. In conclusion, Molotov guaranteed that the Anglo-Soviet agreement does not contain any secret clauses.

### Dill Delivers Speech in America

On the evening of the 17th, he attended the United Nations General Assembly and delivered a speech, stating briefly: "We deeply wish the United Nations a prosperous future, even greater than we hope for. However, there are still some disappointments and darkness ahead of us. The difficult stage of the war has not yet been overcome. At present, we should have a new determination to sacrifice everything, risk everything, and enhance our spirit of dedication. This is what this war requires."

### Sevastopol Situation Critical Under Intense German Land and Air Attacks; German Communiqué Claims Breakthrough into Inner Defense Lines; Soviet Counterattack on Upper Donets River

Berlin, 19th (Allied News Agency) – News from here today states that the northern part of the entire fortress of Sevastopol is now in the hands of German forces. The Soviet defense, under the intense German assault, has been shattered.

Berlin, 19th (Reuter’s Agency) – German military circles believe that the occupation of key defensive fortifications such as the Gorky Fortress north of Sevastopol by the German-Romanian forces is of decisive value. German forces have now broken through into the inner defense perimeter, and the enemy's position is extremely precarious. Yesterday's German war report stated that German forces are advancing towards a point three kilometers from the entrance to the port of Sevastopol, which military circles also consider important. As for the defense of southern Sevastopol, it has also lost its value, as German forces will soon be able to attack it from the rear.

Fuehrer Headquarters, 19th (Reuter’s Agency) – This afternoon's German war report stated that German infantry operating in northern Sevastopol have penetrated deep into the enemy's final defense line, reaching Severnaya Bay opposite Sevastopol. As a result of twelve days of hard fighting by the German forces, with the exception of the artillery battery in the southwestern corner, the entire northern fortress is in German hands. The uncaptured battery is expected to be captured soon. From June 7th to 17th, the number of prisoners increased to 7,585, capturing 20 tanks, 68 artillery pieces, and countless other military supplies and equipment. A total of 1,288 bunkers and trenches were captured, and 46,329 torpedoes were cleared.

Bern, Switzerland, 19th (Reuter’s Agency) – A report from Moscow by the British Exchange Telegraph Company yesterday stated that the residents of Sevastopol have become cave dwellers. The situation in the city is extremely dire, with most streets reduced to rubble. Since the end of May, residents have been unable to live in the city and have been hiding in cellars 24 hours a day to avoid shells and bombs. The German offensive against Sevastopol has indeed made considerable progress.

### Analysis of the Entire Eastern Front Situation

Somewhere on the Soviet border, 18th (Havas News Agency) – Nearly a year has passed since the outbreak of the German-Soviet war. An analysis of the entire battlefield is as follows: The situation in the port of Sevastopol is precarious, not unlike that of Leningrad at the beginning. The Axis forces continue to advance, and casualties on both sides are heavy. There is little doubt that this fortress is in imminent danger. On the upper reaches of the Donets River, German forces under General Bock continue to attack the Red Army positions. The enemy has already gained a foothold north of the area and established positions on the east bank of the upper Donets River. The Red Army authorities are well aware of the urgency of the situation and have already begun a counterattack. Losses in manpower and resources are heavy, but they have failed to reverse the situation. The German High Command, disregarding the Red Army's determined resistance, has already deployed heavy artillery positions. In the Kharkov region, General Bock's forces, including multiple infantry divisions, will launch a major counterattack once the heavy rains cease. Their goal is to occupy the industrialized triangle area. It is expected that after the fall of the port of Sevastopol, the German forces will send a large number of reinforcements to support them. South of Leningrad, German forces are currently intensifying their offensive, but according to Soviet sources, the Red Army is attacking German positions in the Volkhov region to relieve the siege of the Red Army between Novgorod and Lyuban, and attempting to contain the German forces to prevent them from advancing on Leningrad from the north. According to the latest news, the German concentration in southern Finland has not yet been completed, largely due to transportation difficulties. According to the opinions of general observers, German forces will not be able to attack Murmansk and Leningrad for the time being.

### Wartime Measures in Cairo, Egypt; Valuables Stored in Vaults

### Second Anniversary of the German-Turkish Friendship Treaty; Relations Between the Two Countries Increasingly Close

Berlin, 19th (Reuter’s Agency) – The German Foreign Ministry spokesman announced yesterday at an information conference on the anniversary of the German-Turkish Friendship Treaty that the German-Turkish Friendship Treaty is based on the interests of both countries and was established on mutual trust between Germany and Turkey. At the beginning of the establishment of the treaty, London believed that German-Turkish relations would inevitably develop in another direction, but the facts are not so. Turkey has always adopted a friendly attitude towards Germany.

Istanbul, 19th (Reuter’s Agency) – A Turkish radio station commented yesterday on the anniversary of the German-Turkish Friendship Treaty, stating that the friendly relations between Germany and Turkey have become increasingly close in the past twelve months, and this has been the case in the past and will continue to improve in the future.

Berlin, 18th (Havas News Agency) – A semi-official source here recently released a message stating that although the Allied powers have tried to seduce Turkey in every possible way, the country still adheres to its neutrality and is not swayed. Although it has signed a mutual assistance treaty with Britain, it still maintains friendly relations with Germany, because the two nations, Germany and Turkey, have had uninterrupted friendly relations for twenty years. The recent friendship treaty established between the two sides was born in this spirit.

Turkish Parliament to Discuss National Defense Budget

Istanbul, 18th (Havas News Agency) – It has been learned that the National Assembly will meet tomorrow to discuss a bill submitted by the committee, proposing the issuance of national bonds worth 150 million pounds (Turkish currency) for national defense expenditures.

American Air Force Personnel Granted Freedom in Turkey

Ankara, 19th (Reuter’s Agency) – The Turkish authorities have allowed the pilots of the American aircraft that landed in Turkey to walk freely on the streets accompanied by a Turkish officer. If they can sign a pledge, they may be allowed to wear civilian clothes.

Ankara, Turkey, 19th (Havas News Agency) – The semi-official Anatolian News Agency issued a message today stating, "According to responsible sources, several American aircraft landed in Turkey some days ago, not intentionally flying over Turkey. Their landing near Ankara and Aliifia was out of necessity. This fact has been clarified when American airmen were interrogated by the authorities."

Bucharest, Romania, 18th (Havas News Agency) – A "Global News" Berlin correspondent cabled that German political figures commenting on the incident of American aircraft violating Turkish airspace generally said that the Anglo-Saxons could not open a second front in Europe and turned to wanting to take action in the Near East. However, this plan is currently difficult to realize, because if Britain wants to have a presence in the Near East, it must have a large number of ships.

### Violent Gunfire on the Colombian Coast; Axis Submarine Engages with American Warship

Buenos Aires, 19th (Allied News Agency) – According to news from Bogota, the capital of Colombia, violent gunfire was heard off the Colombian coast on Wednesday night. It is believed that this was the result of an engagement between an Axis submarine and an American destroyer, which proves the boldness of Axis submarines operating in the Caribbean Sea. The Bogota news did not provide details, but it is claimed here that the reported engagement indicates that Axis submarines can now operate freely in the Caribbean Sea, as the Colombian coast is the southernmost point of the Caribbean Sea.

Washington, 18th (Havas News Agency) – The Navy Department has announced that a small Norwegian freighter was sunk by a submarine in the Gulf of Mexico. The rescued crew members have landed in a nearby port.

Lisbon, 19th (Reuter’s Agency) – According to news yesterday, the Dutch cargo ship Flora (1,417 tons), chartered by the United States, was sunk by a German submarine off the coast of Colombia on Wednesday night. Thirty-seven crew members were rescued.

German Announcement of Submarine Warfare Results

Berlin, 19th (Reuter’s Agency)

The German High Command issued the following communiqué yesterday, commenting on the continued sinking of nineteen British and American merchant ships in the Atlantic and Caribbean: The United States government has now expanded its defensive shipping measures, intensified the transport of war necessities overseas, and requisitioned all seaworthy vessels for escort duty. Even motorboats and private yachts have been requisitioned by the US military to defend against the ever-increasing danger of submarine attacks. In addition, the United States has expanded patrol cruises to avoid German submarines. However, German submarines recently attacked their heavily defended convoys, sinking twelve ships carrying important materials, totaling 109,000 tons. In the past four days, the enemy has lost no fewer than thirty-three ships, totaling 220,000 tons, mostly sunk in the Atlantic and Mediterranean. Seven warships protecting the convoys have also been sunk, including two cruisers and five destroyers. The defensive measures taken by the enemy have now proven to be incorrect. The effectiveness of German torpedoes has made it impossible for Britain and the United States to reverse the serious dangers to shipping.

### Important Nature of Italian-Spanish Talks; Suner Postpones Audience with the Pope

Rome, 19th (Reuter’s Agency) – Political figures here are paying close attention to an article published yesterday in Florence's "National Day," which stated that the talks between Spanish Foreign Minister Suner and Italian Prime Minister Ciano lasted a long time, indicating the importance of their nature. Moreover, the talks were held during the decisive stage of the Mediterranean war, so there is no doubt that this was discussed.

Vatican City, 19th (Havas News Agency) – Spanish Foreign Minister Suner plans to visit Pope Pius XII while in Italy, but the Pope is suffering from a minor illness and cannot receive him on time. It is reported that Suner has decided to stay in Rome for a few more days to wait for the Pope's recovery before making the visit.

Vatican City, 19th (Havas News Agency) – Pope Pius XII, who is suffering from the flu, has recovered today, but his temperature is still at 39 degrees. A physician visits the palace several times a day for treatment.

### Startling Figures for US War Expenses; 265 Billion Dollars

He stated that the US is actively building aircraft carriers and is determined to complete them in the 1943 fiscal year. The construction of battleships will be stopped, and the battleships already under construction will be launched this year.

### Death of German Mechanized Unit Commander Hühnlein

Berlin, 19th (Reuter’s Agency) – Hühnlein, the commander of the National Socialist Party Motor Corps, died of stomach disease in Munich yesterday morning. Mr. Hühnlein was a world-renowned car racing expert. Whenever there were car races, Mr. Hühnlein would not hesitate to travel far and wide to watch them. In addition to the positions conferred by the Fuehrer, Mr. Hühnlein's most important duties were various matters related to the Motor Corps Commander. Since the outbreak of the war, the work has become even more arduous. Since the first day of the German invasion of Poland, the National Socialist Party Motor Corps has been responsible for transportation work in the occupied areas. Before 1923, Mr. Hühnlein was a professional soldier. Later, because he wanted to join the National Socialist Party, he resigned from his position as a Major in the Army. Mr. Hühnlein participated in the Munich Putsch and was imprisoned with Hitler in the Landsberg Fortress for six months. After his release, he continued to serve the party and worked hard to motorize the stormtroopers. In addition to serving as the Motor Corps Commander, Mr. Hühnlein was also a Major General in the German Army, a member of Parliament since 1938, and one of the leaders of the German National Socialist Party.

### Axis Forces Advance in North Africa; Tobruk Surrounded; Now Within Range of German Artillery; British Build New Defense Line on Egyptian Border

Berlin, 19th (Reuter’s Agency) – Responsible sources revealed that German-Italian forces have completed the encirclement of Tobruk.

Lisbon, 19th (Allied News Agency) – After fifteen days of attacks by Axis armored forces, the British Eighth Army in North Africa was divided into two groups and forced to retreat to new positions yesterday. One group is now stationed near the Egyptian border, while the other group has retreated to the Tobruk defense line, attempting to defend this strong coastal stronghold against Axis encirclement. A dispatch from Cairo describes this situation, stating that Tobruk is now only connected to the main force of the British army under General Ritchie along the coastal road east to Sollum. German forces are stepping up their encirclement of Tobruk, which is now within range of German artillery.

Berlin, 19th (Allied News Agency) – Responsible sources here claimed today that after the British forces in Libya withdrew from El Adem and Bir Hakeim, German forces have completed the encirclement around Tobruk. At the same time, after German armored columns crushed British resistance at Bir Hakeim, they continued to advance east, while British forces retreated east towards the Egyptian border. British fortresses south of El Adem were occupied on Wednesday, and several British positions in Acroma were heavily attacked yesterday. British sources regarding the Acroma battle stated that German forces launched a strong attack from dawn until evening. The dispatch did not provide details, but military circles in London suspect that British forces may have withdrawn from Acroma.

Lisbon, 19th (Allied News Agency) – A British dispatch from Cairo today acknowledged that German forces have encircled the Tobruk area and stated that the positions in the western desert are now the same as before the British offensive in November of last year. However, German forces do not occupy the positions directly opposite Egypt at that time. British forces still have troops in the Libyan desert. The road from Tobruk to the east has now been cut off by German forces, and Gambut is now in the hands of the Axis forces. The Axis forces have not exerted significant pressure on Tobruk. Their main force is advancing east from El Adem. The Halfaya Pass remains in British hands.

Somewhere on the Libyan border, 18th (Havas News Agency) – According to the latest news from the front, Axis forces are gradually gaining the upper hand on the Libyan front.

### Seven. A Glimpse of Libya

Libya is located in northern Africa, west of Egypt, and across the Mediterranean Sea from Italy. Therefore, this desert land has always been Italy's forbidden zone. Recent telegrams indicate that the war in Libya is extremely fierce, with German-Italian allied forces and British forces charging at each other with tanks. It is said that both sides are showing signs of exhaustion. A telegram from the Havas News Agency in the Swiss capital contains a noteworthy sentence: "...At the same time, Berlin expressed optimism about the future of the Libyan war, but remained silent." In the scorching heat of over 100 degrees, both sides can only use tanks to engage in combat, making it difficult to determine the outcome in a short period. If the Axis forces can pose a threat to the Near East countries in North Africa, the British forces' desperate struggle here will have a somewhat restraining effect, prolonging the war within Soviet territory. The Libyan war has not yet come to an end as of the reporter's deadline, but it has attracted worldwide attention. Many people must be speculating about the future destiny of this desert region, with different opinions. The reporter will not recklessly make judgments here and will let the facts reveal the observations of the discerning gentlemen. Administratively, Libya is divided into two parts: Tripolitania and Cyrenaica. The capital of the former is the famous Tripoli, and the capital of the latter is Benghazi. Each has a governor stationed there. The total area is over 420,000 square miles, and the population is approximately 770,000. There are fertile spring lands in the middle of the desert, which Libya's farmland relies on for irrigation.

Benghazi is located in the northwest of Cyrenaica, on the Gulf of Sidra, bordering the Mediterranean coast. The coastline is lined with tall buildings. For the past thirty years, Italians have been continuously developing it, expanding the urban area as much as possible, making it more than three times larger than the original city. The city has wide streets and modern buildings. A park has been built next to the old Arab district for the city's residents to relax and enjoy themselves. There is also a modern arena where various sports competitions such as horse racing, ball games, and races are held in late September every year. Currently, with the tensions of war in North Africa, Benghazi has become a vital hub for Italy to transport troops and supplies. The land in the surrounding countryside is extremely fertile, with orchards, vineyards, and bean fields everywhere, producing abundant yields every year.

The coastline of Cyrenaica receives abundant rainfall, sufficient for agricultural needs without the need for irrigation. If there is a severe drought one year in five, Italian engineers take measures to remedy this deficiency by attempting to find artesian wells or excavate spring sources in the area to prevent emergencies. Driving east along the highway on the Libyan coast, one only sees scattered rural villages, all of which are newly settled foreigners. This is originally an American colonization plan, preparing to colonize 80,000 farming families to Libya by this year. Each family must have at least eight people, be of agricultural background, healthy, literate, a member of the Fascist Party, and of good character. The organization of each village is completely consistent, including churches, schools, sports fields, pharmacies, assembly halls, and party headquarters. All agricultural equipment is supplied by the authorities, such as houses, pigsties, granaries, seeds, farm tools, machinery, and other utensils. However, those who leave their hometowns for Libya should have the spirit and courage of pioneers. This is how the granary of the Roman Empire was built!

The tip of Cyrenaica - the city of Cyrene. Near the springs in the mountains, there are ancient bathhouses. Therefore, the Italian governor once renovated the bathhouses for private use. Moreover, there is a villa on the mountain, overlooking the magnificent scenery of ancient and modern times, with an unobstructed view. This is the greatest city established by the Greeks overseas. Now, only broken statues and dilapidated walls remain, all piles of rubble. North of the city, countless ancient tombs remain. In the 7th century BC, Greeks fled to this place and built the city of Cyrene, which was bustling and prosperous for seven hundred years. In its heyday, it is said that the city had as many as 100,000 residents.

One thing can prove the prosperity of the city of Cyrene. A record was once found on a hard stone excavated from the ruins. Between 331 and 323 BC, when there was a great famine in Greece, the city of Cyrene transported a total of 29,000 tons of grain to relieve the famine in its homeland.

Less than ten miles from the city of Cyrene is a commercial port called Apollonia. At that time, countries near and far along the Mediterranean coast, such as Greece, Syria, and cities in the Egyptian Delta, had to send ships to Apollonia for trade.

The philosopher Aristippus of Cyrene, who advocated pleasure as the supreme goal of life, the atheist Theodorus, the geographer Eratosthenes, who first determined the length of the meridian, and the poet Callimachus all lived in Cyrene.

After the Greeks lost power, Cyrene fell under Egyptian rule and was then occupied by Rome. In 115 AD, the Jewish residents of the area massacred Romans and Libyans, dealing a great blow to the prosperous city of Cyrene. After the fourth century, invasions by indigenous barbarians and damage from earthquakes gradually led to the city's decline. Traveling east along the coast from Cyrene, one only sees crisscrossing fields, all agricultural areas. Derna, formerly known as fertile due to mountain spring irrigation, is still very fertile today. Derna's abundant water source is extremely important for the Italian army's strategy. Tobruch, a coastal city east of Derna, lacks fresh water, so it uses ships equipped with water tanks to transport water from Derna. Along the coast of Cyrenaica, only Derna and Benghazi have fresh water that can supply local needs.

Advancing along the road where chariots of the ancient Roman Empire once passed, one reaches Tobruch. From here, the fertile land gradually decreases for 110 miles, followed by a desert. The British air and naval forces bombed here last year to prevent the Italian army from advancing. Italy has a naval base and army barracks near the port. The bay here is formed by a peninsula curving eastward into the sea. The harbor is two miles long and less than a mile wide. It is ice-free all year round, and large warships can freely enter and exit, making it the best military port in North Africa. Looking at a map of Africa, the area of Libya cannot be considered small, at least five and a half times larger than the mainland United States. It is a pity that only a very small portion of it is suitable for planting. Except for the coastal Mediterranean area of Cyrenaica and some areas of Tripoli, the place names that can be found on the map only indicate that a small team of sentries is stationed there, or that there are a few mud houses, fertile land in the desert, or that there is a water source. The rest of the land is either full of sand and gravel or a vast expanse of barren yellow sand, with a sultry climate and no signs of human habitation for days. The British side admits that the German threat to the port of Tobruch is increasing, and General Rommel's troops will soon come into contact with the first line of defense of this fortress. In fact, the port of Tobruch has been surrounded by Axis forces, and the only retreat is eastward along the coast. A British light force is currently disrupting the German-Italian armored vehicle formations on the southwest sides of the port to create a restraining effect, preventing them from directly attacking the port. General Ritchie seems to have made a major determination to defend this fortress at all costs. However, according to the latest news, the British General Headquarters, due to the strong pressure from the Axis forces, has no other choice but to withdraw its troops behind the port of Tobruch to set up a new defense line between the port and the Egyptian border and continue to resist. There is no definite news in the Acroma area, only that the British army has abandoned its original position and is making a large-scale retreat towards the port of Tobruch. Based on this, after the British army retreated from these two strongholds, namely Acroma and El Adem, it is now only holding the Tobruch fortress. Moreover, in the past two days, Axis forces have reportedly concentrated in the El Adem area, and a large number of reinforcements and military supplies have been continuously transported in, preparing to launch a large-scale offensive to the east. General Rommel's goal is clearly to isolate the port of Tobruch, ensuring that the British army in the port cannot be transferred to participate in future offensives, so the German army can take the opportunity to attack eastward. Therefore, General Rommel considers the battle for the port of Tobruch to be very important.

### German War Report

Berlin, 19th, Havas News Agency - The German High Command last night issued a detailed report on the Libyan war for the first time, stating that the Axis forces have now broken into the Mediterranean coast and are heavily advancing towards Tobruch. Many British troops have been surrounded by us. Since the occupation of Bir Hakeim, the Axis forces have advanced from the south, attacking the flanks of the British forces in the Gazala area and engaging the British forces in Tobruch. Fierce battles took place in Acroma on June 14, destroying many enemy armored vehicles. Therefore, the German-Italian allied forces have now been able to advance towards the coast. Later, a South African brigade was annihilated in Acroma, and another British and South African division each suffered heavy losses. The battles in the Gazala area were also very fierce. The Axis forces occupied 10,400 square kilometers in that area. The German air force assisted the army in advancing north and east, with significant results, destroying many enemy tanks and other vehicles. In the past four days, German aircraft have shot down a total of 54 British aircraft.

### Mediterranean Naval Battle - British Losses

Stockholm, Sweden, 19th, Havas News Agency - News received here from London regarding the attack on the Mediterranean convoy remains silent on the British losses, but provides a detailed description of the naval and air battles, proving the intensity of the fighting. London claims that the sacrifice of the western Mediterranean convoy was to divert the enemy's attention so that the eastern Mediterranean convoy could safely reach Tobruch. According to a correspondent for the Swedish newspaper, the arrival of the convoy in Tobruch is not enough to compensate for the losses suffered by General Ritchie. According to responsible British authorities, they will no longer provide reporters with accurate information on losses, as the public is becoming increasingly uneasy about the failures in Libya.

Rome, 18th, Central News Agency - The Italian Air Force fiercely attacked the British fleet in the Mediterranean. According to an 18th Stefani dispatch, the Italian Air Force in this campaign damaged the British battleship Malaya, 31,000 tons, the aircraft carrier Eagle, 12,600 tons, and the Argus, 14,000 tons.

### Heads of Households Must Collect Rice Purchase Certificates Without Delay

The date for rice distribution will be announced separately by the authorities.

Lost rice purchase certificates will not be reissued.

The distribution of rice rations based on population in the two concessions has been scheduled to begin on the 22nd. The dates for heads of households in each district to collect their certificates have been specified separately. They are announced daily in the newspapers and also relayed by the Baojia Guidance Department to each Lianbao Jia head to notify each head of household to go to the designated offices for issuing rice purchase certificates on the specified date. The collection of these rice purchase certificates must not be delayed.

Distribution of Rice on the Same Day is a Misunderstanding

Recently, foreigners have mistakenly taken the date for issuing rice purchase certificates as the date for distributing rice. To eliminate this misunderstanding, the French Concession authorities have specifically reiterated that the 22nd of this month is the date for starting to issue rice purchase certificates. As for the date for distributing rice, it will be announced after a decision has been made. People who have received rice purchase certificates are urged to keep them safe and not lose them under any circumstances, as the authorities will not reissue them for any reason.

Rice Purchase Certificates Must Be Kept Safely

A public announcement from the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) Information Office states that there seems to be a misunderstanding among the public regarding the date from which rice can be purchased with the rice purchase certificates issued by the Council. The Council hereby announces that although the issuance of rice purchase certificates to taxpayers is scheduled to begin on June 22 of this year, the date from which rice can be purchased with these certificates has not yet been determined and will be announced separately after a decision is made. People who have obtained SMC rice purchase certificates must keep the certificates safely and must not lose or hand them over to others. The Council will not reissue them under any circumstances. The public must pay attention.

Collection Locations and Dates for Rice Purchase Certificates

The locations for citizens in various districts of the two concessions to collect rice purchase certificates have been arranged and reported in yesterday's newspaper.

### Some Pawnshops in the French Concession Resumed Operations Yesterday and Will Request the French Consulate to Amend the Regulations

Since the 180-odd pawnshops and pledge shops in the French Concession stopped accepting pledges the day before yesterday due to the management regulations of the French Consulate, they have been persuaded by the Pawnshop Association and the Pledge Shop Association. As a result, some resumed accepting pledges yesterday. As for the Pawnshop Association and the Pledge Shop Association, they are currently gathering to discuss and formulate opinions to be submitted to the French Concession authorities, requesting amendments to the regulations to maintain their business. According to the Datong News Agency reporter, the opinions of the industry associations and shops are as follows:

Opinions of the Pawnshop Industry

The Pawnshop Association believes that the French Consulate's regulations this time are indeed largely impossible to implement. The industry's unanimous decision to stop accepting pledges was a last resort. However, the cessation of pledges will inevitably affect the urgent needs of ordinary people for funds and will cause social instability. Therefore, the association is making every effort to persuade its members to temporarily resume accepting pledges as usual. However, until the Consulate's order is amended, accepting pledges as usual will involve many legal violations. Therefore, in addition to annotating in detail the difficult provisions of the Consulate's order and preparing to request amendments, the association also plans to first make a factual statement in writing to the French Concession authorities so that its members can conduct their business in peace. The association also stated that it understands the purpose of the new Consulate's order, which is nothing more than to prevent the acceptance of stolen goods. However, in fact, according to investigations over the past few months, incidents of stolen goods in the 18 pawnshops in the French Concession are extremely rare. Moreover, the competent authorities originally formulated the Shanghai Municipal Regulations for Pawnshop Operations, which had specific provisions for pawnshops receiving stolen goods. Except for items that should be rejected under Rule 10 of the regulations, "Public goods with clear identification or rare and precious items whose prices cannot be determined," pawnshops generally only recognize the goods and not the person, and accept all pledges. The provisions of the new Consulate's order are excessively strict for the managers and employees, shrinking the scope of business and creating a risk of violating regulations at every turn. Therefore, unless the provisions of the new Consulate's order are amended, it is impossible for the members to continue their business.

### Careless Cycling Leads to Fatality

Wu Chang'an, a nineteen-year-old apprentice youth from Hubei working at Dafeng Yangzahuohao at No. 198 Avenue Edward VII, was riding a bicycle on the afternoon of the 16th when, at the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Rue de Villermont, Zhao Dai Shi, a thirty-one-year-old woman from Shaoxing living at No. 8 Lanfa Lane, Zhaojia Road, Nanshi, carrying her ten-month-old infant named Yue Liang, was crossing Avenue Joffre from Rue de Villermont when Wu's bicycle passed by. Unable to avoid, Wu knocked down Zhao Dai Shi, and the child fell several feet away, suffering serious injuries. The police arrived and took both parties to the police station. The injured child was transferred to Guangci Hospital for treatment but died the day before yesterday. The police sent the child's body to the coroner for examination and returned it to the family yesterday for burial. Meanwhile, the family of the deceased has filed a negotiation with Wu Chang'an, who caused the accident, demanding compensation of 5,000 yuan. The police have also charged Wu with negligent homicide and will handle the case according to the law.

### The Transmission of Leprosy by Ding Fubao

Everyone knows that leprosy is a contagious disease, similar to tuberculosis, caused by the spread of a bacterium. However, formally speaking, tuberculosis is not as externally visible as leprosy, because leprosy, after a certain period, can cause the skin, fingers, face, etc., to become terrifying images, causing people to fear and avoid it. However, according to recent research by leprosy experts, its contagiousness is not as easy as generally imagined. Doctors and staff in leprosy hospitals are proof of this. They are close to patients every day but have not been infected. This does not negate the contagiousness of leprosy but wants us to know that the transmission of leprosy has conditions in life and prevention.

Take England as an example. In the Middle Ages, there was also an epidemic of leprosy, but today, it has almost disappeared. It is clearly known that this is due to improvements in their lives. The damp wooden houses they used to live in are now made of cement and brick, with good air circulation and sufficient light. Running water can be used for bathing and washing. Special attention is paid to the nutrition of food. Various needs of the human body are fully supplied to resist the reproduction of bacteria. With such reasonable hygiene, a healthy body can naturally be cultivated. Leprosy bacteria have lost their medium of transmission and gradually disappeared. On the contrary, what about China? General living conditions are just the opposite, with dirty, dark, and damp dwellings and poor nutrition, making transmission easy and increasingly widespread. The aforementioned doctors and staff have antiseptic and sterilizing hygiene and healthy resistance, so the virus is not easy to infect them.

From the former perspective, we must pay attention to the patient's lifestyle; from the latter perspective, we should pay attention to preventive hygiene. The establishment of the Chinese Leprosy Relief Association is based on this standpoint, setting up sanatoriums and clinics to treat patients with newly developed medicines and taking in patients to improve their lives. However, in China today, there are as many as millions of leprosy patients, and it is only possible to accommodate over 50,000 people. This is a drop in the bucket, and the goal of eradicating this disease is still far away. Without huge amounts of funding and large-scale accommodation, success cannot be expected. If everyone can work together and provide full financial assistance, it is not impossible to eliminate this major problem. It is hoped that enthusiastic social figures will donate generously during this fundraising campaign of the association, so that ordinary needle-holders will not have the risk of being infected. That would be fortunate.

### The SMC Issues Bonds Worth 5 Million Yuan to Supplement Temporary Expenses, Issued at 92.5% of Face Value

The SMC recently issued an announcement No. 595, stating that the Council has now decided to issue bonds worth 5 million yuan to cover the expenses specified in this year's temporary expenditure budget. The public is invited to subscribe. The bonds issued this time are denominated in Central Reserve Bank currency (CRB) and bear interest at an annual rate of six percent from the date of purchase. The first interest payment date is December 31 of this year, and subsequent interest payments will be made on June 30 and December 31 of each year. The bonds are issued at 92.5% of face value and will be redeemed by lottery in ten years, starting in December 1948, with 500,000 CRB redeemed each time until the bonds are fully redeemed in October 1957. The security for the redemption and interest payments is the Council's property and the Council's annual tax revenue. The bonds are divided into three denominations: 10,000 yuan, 5,000 yuan, and 1,000 yuan, to facilitate subscription. It is now scheduled to begin issuing the bonds at 10:00 AM on June 22 of this year at the Treasury Bank and Bond Office, No. 257, Finance Department, No. 209 Jiangxi Road, SMC Office. Subscription application forms can be obtained from the head of the Finance Department of the Council. If there are any remaining bonds after the public subscription, the Central Trust Bureau will undertake to purchase them.

### Profiteering from Hoarding: A Rascal's Covetousness

Feng Jiquan, a Jiangyin native and manager of the Huisheng Foreign Firm at 52 Yanghang Street in the French Concession, has recently been hoarding tin foil and has already made a considerable profit. A rascal named Li Mengquan (27 years old), a Shaoxing native, learned of this and, on the previous day, colluded with two fellow villagers, Wei Chengyou and another who was at large after escaping custody. They went to Feng's house to buy ten packages of tin foil, valued at 7,200 reserve certificates. Li and his accomplices instructed Feng to deliver the goods to No. 46 Sijing Road for payment. Feng believed them to be genuine and ordered his apprentice, Li Weihe, to deliver the goods. Li and his accomplices handed over a Shun Tai Zhuang bank draft. Li Weihe demanded cash payment, but Li Mengquan falsely claimed that if cash was required, they would have to go to a certain place on Jin Shenfu Road to collect it. Consequently, Li Weihe followed Li Mengquan to Jin Shenfu Road. Li Mengquan attempted to escape but was discovered and apprehended. He was taken to the police station, where Li Mengquan confessed to plotting fraud, stating that the stolen goods had already been taken by Wei Chengyou to Tong Fulin, the manager of the Hongsheng Cotton Cloth Shop on Xiangfen Lane. Detectives were immediately dispatched to recover the original stolen goods and bring them back to the police station. Li Mengquan was detained, awaiting the arrest of his accomplices at large, for further investigation.

### The Modern Accessories for Young Ladies in Their Boudoirs: Women's Wide-Brimmed Straw Hats - Sufficient to Enhance Beauty and Add Charm; Men and Women of Ancient Times All Wore Them Outdoors

Childhood Memories

The continuous days of plum rain have washed the earth into a different scene, but the weather is still hot and unbearable. When the sun finally comes out, it is scorching and relentless, making one feel like an ant on a hot pot, with no way out. Recently, bicycles have become popular, and many people enjoy cycling in the countryside. However, the scorching sun causes dizziness and flushed faces, with sweat dripping down. When the wind is strong, it blows one's hair into a mess, looking like one has lost a loved one. After spending more than an hour carefully applying makeup, hoping to show off, one ends up looking like a living ghost. Therefore, clever merchants have realized that wide-brimmed straw hats are the perfect product for the season. I recall that in my childhood, every summer, my father would buy a new straw hat for himself and also buy a small straw hat for me. The fluttering blue ribbon on the hat still captivates me. At that time, it was enough to make me feel glorious, and I would show it off among my friends. They would stretch out their small hands, stroking the top of the hat, with their round eyes, the black pupils rolling around, filled with envy. Standing on the swing in the park, going back and forth, the blue ribbon flying in the air, how proud I was! Time flies, and when I grew up to be a teenager, I noticed that no one else was wearing straw hats, and I felt embarrassed to wear one myself. Although I still had fond memories in my heart, the small child, in the vast boudoir, could not display its power to block the sun. I couldn't help but wonder why Chinese women today don't wear straw hats. Is it because customs forbid it? There is no sufficient reason. Is it because they are not beautiful to wear? I fear it would backfire. So why is it?

New Style Straw Hats

If your face is too long or too short, you can choose a straw hat and wear it tilted forward, backward, to the left, or to the right, and it will look good.

Hats and Face

For Western women, hats are not only practical but also an important accessory to enhance beauty. A plain face can look very attractive with a suitable felt hat or a straw hat adorned with flowers. Sometimes it can make the face appear shorter, avoiding a horse-like elongated look that is very unattractive. At other times, it can make the face appear longer, avoiding a pancake-like uncomfortable look. This all depends on the skillful use of tilting the hat forward, backward, to the left, or to the right.

Jeanette MacDonald

I remember that every time I watched Jeanette MacDonald's movies, I always felt that when she wore a hat, her face was of perfect length and shape, charming and beautiful. But in ordinary shots, she was much less attractive. Joan Crawford's performance in "A Woman's Face," with a hat tilted to the side, concealing the half of her face that was scarred from burns, was indeed something that people did not find overly repulsive. Therefore, European and American women pay great attention to the style of hats, often spending a lot of money and patiently trying on hats in fashion companies for a good part of the day, without being satisfied.

The Innate Love of Beauty

The love of beauty and face-saving are innate to human nature, especially for women. Chinese women are no exception. It is not common for women in Chinese history to pay attention to wearing cool hats. However, among the various customs and habits of different ethnic groups in the country, the general working women all like to wear cool hats, which protect against the heat and facilitate work. Although the materials and styles vary from place to place, the intention is roughly the same. However, it is not entirely true to say that women in ancient times never wore straw hats. Reading Yuan Haowen's poem from the Jin Dynasty, "Watching the peach and plum blossoms wither and fall, I choose more lush branches to insert in the brim of my hat," since there is a hat brim and it is in summer, it can be assumed that it is a cool hat of the straw hat type. It can also be seen that women in ancient times also wore cool hats and inserted flower branches as decorations. The Chinese also value wearing hats as a form of etiquette. Men perform the capping ceremony at the age of twenty, and must wear a hat when going in and out thereafter. Women wear hairpins as fasteners or wrap their heads with headscarves. The Book of Songs says, "With a bun and a cap, and a hairpin sticking out," that is what it means. There were also female Taoists in later generations called female coronalists, which shows that they must wear crowns when going in and out. The Miao people have had cool hats since ancient times, woven from rattan or various soft grasses, all adorned with beautiful decorations, and some with fresh flowers inserted. When going to the market on the third month, men and women in red and green compete in beauty and splendor, wearing various floral hats, which are bright and dazzling, similar to modern European-style women's hats. In the past, Zhuge Wuhou conquered the Southern Barbarians using large rattan hats, which could cover the entire body. Meng Huo's women's army also wore this kind of rattan hat, coated with tung oil, which was difficult for spears and halberds to penetrate, and was very useful. It can be seen that wearing hats is not only a European and American custom, but China has also had the etiquette of wearing hats since ancient times. Noble women mostly wore phoenix crowns and used parasols on carriages, while common people mostly wore straw hats.

Floral Ribbon Wide Brim Hat

Since the Republic of China, everyone, regardless of social status, has worn straw hats. Perhaps because young ladies in the past were deeply in boudoirs and had little need for cool hats, they were not popular. With the progress of the times, girls have broken out of their homes and compete in society. When cyclists drive gracefully through the streets, adding a floral ribbon wide-brimmed straw hat will add a lot of color. They are decorations to be seen on the road and by the swimming pool. I remember that Yu Wen from central Hunan wrote a poem about cool hats that can serve as evidence: "The crown is dignified, and noble etiquette, driving a car and wearing a hat is more people-oriented; a floral-edged cool hat conveniently shields the sun, a hairpin-wearing woman struts through the market."

### Six Dead After Alcohol Factory Explosion - Cause Believed to Be Excessive Heating; Eight Injured Workers Still Unhealed

According to the English-language "Great Beauty Evening News," an explosion occurred on the 18th at an alcohol factory located at No. 26, Lane 365, North Henan Road. As of today, six workers have died, making it the most tragic industrial accident of the year.

Unlicensed for Hazardous Materials

After investigation, it was confirmed that the factory violated the Municipal Council's regulations for factory management and did not have a hazardous materials license. Previous reports that the explosion was caused by extracting coffee essence from tea were inaccurate. Although equipment for extracting coffee essence was found in the rubble, it had not been used for a long time.

Distiller Explosion

The explosion was actually caused by a distiller capable of holding sixty gallons, used to extract alcohol from sorghum wine. The heating pipe of the distiller seemed to have been damaged, and yesterday, the heat was too high or the work was careless, causing the explosion. With a deafening roar, the distiller was blown off its base, three walls were blown through, and the entire factory building shook. If the firefighters had not arrived to support it, the entire building might have collapsed.

Fourteen Injured

At the time, fourteen workers were injured by the explosion or struck by bricks and tiles. Thirteen of them were still conscious and quickly fled into the back alley, where they were rescued by ambulance staff. The other worker had already collapsed. Five people also died of their injuries yesterday afternoon and evening. The remaining eight workers are still in the hospital for treatment.

Factory Specializes in Refining Tea Paste

According to Datong News Agency, the incident of the steam boiler explosion that killed and injured fourteen people, as reported in various newspapers yesterday, was investigated by the Datong News Agency reporter with relevant parties, and it was learned that the owner was Yuanyuan Tea Refining Factory, which is a newly established small-scale factory. Because the factory is a joint-stock company, it is managed by a local Zheng. The factory was recently established and specializes in refining tea paste for sale to other ports. Although the machinery it has prepared has been approved for use, it has never been put into operation since it was purchased. The day before yesterday was the first day of operation. When testing the machine, due to the carelessness of the workers, the temperature of the steam boiler was not paid attention to, resulting in an explosion caused by overheating. Four injured workers have been discharged from the hospital. Because most of the shareholders of the factory are not in Shanghai, there is still no proper way to provide compensation.

### Foreigners Remitting Funds to Hong Kong: Application Procedures Handled by Yokohama Specie Bank

### First Batch of New Peas Appear; Difficult to Transport, Prices Difficult to Lower; Corn Sells Well, Surging 10 Yuan

Jiangbei new peas (40 bags) were priced at 163 yuan. Chongming sand (20 bags) were priced at 115 yuan. Among them, the new peas were the first batch on the market, with acceptable quality, but difficult to transport, making it hard to lower the price.

Corn sales improved yesterday, as more common people eat it to fill their hunger under high cost of living pressures, so the market became brisk again, and prices suddenly rebounded by about 10 yuan. Wuhu corn (1,100 bags) was priced at 126 yuan to 128 yuan self-pickup, and 119 yuan to 135 yuan delivered.

New dried sweet potatoes have gradually arrived, but they are not dry enough and are prone to mold, so sellers' intentions to sell have loosened, and the market has weakened. Yesterday, 60 bags of Jiangbei new dried sweet potatoes were sold, priced at 210 yuan to 214 yuan.

Bran: Hoarders firmly held on to their goods, causing the market to remain firm. Yesterday, 400 bags of Jinxin small-package bran were sold, with warehouse receipts dated April 26 priced at 85 yuan, and warehouse receipts dated June 12 at 86.5 yuan.

### High Metal Prices and Sluggish Sales

The metal market, affected by the lack of spot goods, is experiencing prosperity and high prices. Many buyers are adopting a wait-and-see approach, inevitably hindering transactions. Enquiries reveal that trading in various goods is not active, and quoted prices are frequently rising.

There is a shortage of both single and double tinplate, as well as various patterned tinplate on the market. Yesterday, merchants were actively seeking supplies. Small metal hardware transactions are also gradually increasing. It has become difficult to purchase entire boxes, and quoted prices are very high. Currently, 90-pound and 100-pound single-layer tinplate are priced at 1,000 yuan per box, while double-layer sheets are priced at 1,100 yuan.

Two-hundred-pound U.S. steel was being searched for in small quantities by canning factories and printing houses yesterday, totaling only about one hundred boxes. Transportation is scheduled for a later date. This is a fixed allocation and must wait for the movement permit to be approved before being transported. However, those in the industry are very astute, and prices are perceived to be quite high, around 1,800 yuan per box.

### Daily Commodity Prices Also Decline

The purchase prices of daily commodities are being affected by the weakening cigarette market. Various importers, due to excessively high prices, are facing sluggish sales. Consequently, they are taking a wait-and-see approach, leading to idle buying and a inevitable downward trend in prices. Yesterday's market saw prices for brands such as "Guben" soap at 670 yuan, "Baixiangmao" soap at 570 yuan, "Jixiangmao" soap at 460 yuan, and "Arrow Knife" soap at 570 yuan, all down by twenty to thirty yuan.

### Continued Rumors of Distribution Cause Cigarette Prices to Plunge

The cigarette market experienced a sharp decline yesterday due to rumors of continued distribution by factories. As a result, businesses were eager to sell off their stock and cover their short positions. Additionally, the continuous rainy weather has made business slow, resulting in very few transactions and a weak market sentiment. Market prices are trending downward. "Great Britain" brand was trading at 17,300 yuan, "Old Knife" brand at 11,000 yuan, down 1,000 yuan from the previous two days. "Brand" was at 9,150 yuan, "Wuhua" brand at 7,900 yuan, and "Fairy" brand at 8,800 yuan, also down by three to four hundred yuan. Prices of Japanese cigarettes are also expected to follow suit. "Golden Gun" brand suddenly returned to the 3,000 yuan mark, at 2,950 yuan, a drop of over 300 yuan. The market later improved slightly, rising to 3,000 yuan.

Yesterday's market price was 600 yuan, down 50 yuan. There are also rumors of government control, and external lenders are unwilling to hold on for long, so market prices are expected to stabilize temporarily.

### Another Account of Yu Shuyan's Illness

— Plum Blossom Pavilion Owner

Urethral Obstruction—Incurable

Long Illness—Exhausted Body

Since this newspaper published the news that "Yu Shuyan's illness is serious," opera fans concerned about Mr. Yu have been calling to inquire about the true state of his illness. As I have not corresponded with Mr. Yu for some time, I have no way of knowing his recent condition. However, the "369 Pictorial" recently published in the Peiping edition had a description stating that "After Yu Shuyan recovered from his illness, his spirits were very good, and his student Meng Xiaodong often visited him." Therefore, my short biography of Mr. Yu included the line "He has recently been eating normally." To ensure accuracy, I visited Mr. Wang Dabang yesterday, who had returned to Shanghai from Peiping. (Mr. Wang is the manager of the Peiping Dachang Western Pharmacy and arrived in Shanghai on the 15th of this month.) Mr. Wang has traveled extensively and has considerable contact with people in the theater world, so his information about Mr. Yu is likely to be detailed and reliable. Mr. Wang said: "Before I left Peiping, I met with the two actors Wang Yaoqing and Tan Xiaozeng. According to what Wang Yaoqing knew, although Mr. Yu's illness had improved, his body was extremely weak after treatment, and his urethra was already obstructed. He has to use a rubber tube to pass urine through a small hole, so the mental anguish he suffers is self-evident. As for whether there have been any recent changes, I don't know."

In short, Mr. Yu is suffering from a long illness and has undergone severe treatment, resulting in a decline of his original vitality. Although medicine can treat illness, it cannot cure fate. While I dare not treat the account of his illness as gospel truth, it is still possible. I will inquire with his student, Ms. Meng Xiaodong, to obtain the true situation and report to you readers.

### Thoughts on "Wang Xifeng"

— Bing Ze

I like "Dream of the Red Chamber," especially Wang Xifeng in "Dream of the Red Chamber." It's not that everyone likes this character, but that I appreciate how vividly and typically the author portrayed her character – selfish, greedy, insidious, and shrewish. On the one hand, she resists the old family’s feudal system with a vengeful attitude. In doing so, she also becomes a henchman of feudalism, ultimately sacrificing herself in vain.

One could also say that Wang Xifeng represents the general traditional women of China over thousands of years. One doesn't necessarily need to say that Cao Yu's "Peking Man" used "Dream of the Red Chamber" as a blueprint in certain places. At the very least, Cao Yu must have thought of this character and been deeply influenced by Wang Xifeng, similarly emphasizing and typifying this kind of Chinese woman.

Based on this, the "Wang Xifeng" on stage is worth noting.

Although the outline of Wang Xifeng's character has already been established, the playwright has adopted a more appropriate approach here, especially in the scenes of poisoning the love scheme and forcing You Erjie to death. The playwright portrays the same cruel and vicious heart through two different attitudes, giving the audience an intuitive understanding. This shows that the author has grasped the core of Wang Xifeng's character, making her both lovable and hateful. Without this, she would easily become commonplace.

In terms of performance, XXXX is originally an actress known for her excellent acting. Now that she has stepped onto the stage, her acting skills are indeed quite refined. However, her speaking skills are relatively weak. Otherwise, the final death scene would be even more powerful. Wu XXX, due to her familiarity with Peking opera, seems somewhat uncoordinated in her movements, similar to Jin Suwen's portrayal of Yang E. However, she worked very hard in the scene where she swallows gold, deeply engaging the audience's emotions. In addition, Sun Qiying, who plays XXXX, and Xia Di, who plays Ping'er, have achieved considerable success.

Overall, performing this play is quite difficult, but "Wang Xifeng" is satisfactory.

### The Beautiful Loretta Young

— Lan Ying

Saying Marriage is a Woman’s Only Way Out

Loretta Young is one of Hollywood's most romantic actresses. Some say that she falls in love easily, but it doesn't last. The first man she met was Glenn Hughes, when she was only seventeen. At first, their feelings were very strong, but it didn't last long, supposedly due to a small incident, and they broke up. A few years later, she fell in love with an actor and married him, but soon divorced. Later, due to poor health, she did not dedicate herself to the screen for a period of time. It wasn't until she filmed the sound film "Ramona" that she returned to the film industry. At this time, she seemed to have grown even more beautiful, and many men pursued her day and night with flowers and gifts. She often went out with them, chatting, laughing, and dancing, but her attitude was always aloof. Several years passed, and in the summer of 1940, Hollywood received the special and delightful news that on July 31, the beautiful Loretta Young had committed herself to Tom Lewis before God's altar. The wedding took place at St. Paul's Church in Whistaho Village.

Loretta Young has been in the film industry for sixteen or seventeen years and is a well-known star, having starred in sixty or seventy films. Almost every film has achieved wonderful success. This is partly due to her affectionate, watery, soul-stirring eyes, but mostly due to her personal attention to makeup and costumes, and her dedication to performance, which is why she is so loved by everyone.

Loretta Young's view of life is praiseworthy. She says: "I believe that a woman should find a suitable young man to fall in love with and marry. I believe that two-thirds of a woman's life is spent on her family and her husband and children. This is a woman's only true way out."

### Mei News

News about Mei Lanfang's whereabouts is of great interest to opera fans, and this publication has also reported on it several times. Yesterday, a friend of his, Mr. XXX, flew from Hong Kong to Shanghai and also mentioned that Mr. Mei is very settled in Hong Kong. His short hair has been styled, making him look younger and more beautiful. He is indeed preparing to come to Shanghai, but there are few XXXs, so he can only wait for XXX to fly over. However, the exact date is still difficult to determine.

### Qiao Qi Fears Shen Min

— Tao Yuansheng

I met Qiao Qi and his friend at Zhijiang Church. I asked Qiao Qi about his relationship with Shen Min, because it has been rumored for a long time that Qiao Qi is pursuing Shen Min, but why haven't we heard any news of Qiao Qi winning Shen Min over?

Qiao Qi, whose real name is Xu Jiaju, is a graduate of the Sino-French Drama School. He has participated in public performances with the Shanghai Drama Society, Da Zhong, Tian Feng, Shang Yi, and other drama troupes. He has also served as a director for small drama troupes. He is always very diligent and conscientious during rehearsals and performances, so his results are very good and his progress is rapid. He will also perform at the Carlton in early July. Shen Min is a lively young girl, probably about twenty years old this year. She studied at the Faculty of Law and Political Science for a year. She is very good at acting, and if she is willing to work hard, her future is limitless. Qiao Qi must have met her two years ago at the Shanghai Drama Society, right?

It is said that Qiao Qi pursuing Shen Min is acceptable, and Qiao Qi winning over Shen Min is also possible. But Qiao Qi said to me with a sanctimonious air:

"Don't mention Shen Min. I'm really afraid of her. Now I don't even dare to walk with her. Busy bodies always say we're in love when they see me and Shen Min together. God knows! That's not the case. She and XXX (he pointed to his friend, a dark-skinned man from Southeast Asia) are very good!"

I couldn't tell if there was a hint of jealousy in those words, but I do think that busy bodies are indeed too meddlesome, turning a man afraid of a woman for no good reason.

### Showbiz Scenery

— Xin Juan

The interior scenes of Chen Yan Yan and Liu Qiong's collaboration "Madame Butterfly" have been completed, and the entire film will be finished soon.

Sun Jing's directed "Peach Blossom Hate" has been submitted to the production department to be renamed "Martyrdom."

Wen Yimin's new work "Mother's Heart" (tentative title) will soon begin filming at the old site of Yihua Company.

Gao Zhanfei's scenes in "If We Hadn't Met Before Marriage" have officially begun filming in recent days.

The China Drama Troupe's "Peking Man" will be performed until the 24th, and the evening performances will feature Zhou XXX and Bai XXX's "Dawn Breeze and 残月" until July 2nd.

The China Drama Troupe's "Peking Man" has decided to launch a "Cao Yu Season," performing all of Cao Yu's works, such as "Sunrise," "Thunderstorm," and "Wilderness." To increase audience interest, the company is publicly soliciting ideal actors (actors limited to Zhongyi). If they meet the ideal criteria, the first prize will be a cash reward, and the second to fourth prizes will each be a long-term complimentary ticket.

### "Skylark" Scheduled to Premiere

Amidst the increasingly fewer Western films being released here, the scheduled premiere of "Skylark" is certainly good news for movie fans. The film stars Claudette Colbert, Ray Milland, and Brian Aherne. Colbert established her high status in comedy with "It Happened One Night," and this film is light, charming, and surpasses "It Happened One Night." It is said that Asian Theater Companies have scheduled this film to premiere at the Majestic Theater, starting tomorrow, Sunday.

### New Variety Troupe Appears

The singing and dancing of variety troupes were once performed at the Low-Card Hall and were well-received by audiences. It is now reported that a new variety troupe has appeared in Wubao and will perform at the Guangming Theater starting today. The program includes over ten kinds of performances, including Hu Chi dance, Spanish dance, and various novel skills, all of which are extremely famous and exciting.

### International Chess News

The Chinese-style international chess sold by bookstores is novel and pleasing to the eye, with beautiful paper and Western instructions. Beginners can learn it easily, and it is praised as the ultimate entertainment, so sales are especially good.

Hard to Say in Entertainment

### Kao Shan Tune

— Ze Fu

The Kao Shan tune is the most popular folk song in the Tianjin area, also known as Shan Luozi (in the North, folk operas and folk songs are both called Luozi), or Tianjin Shi Yao (or Shi Yao, possibly a mistake). It was originally a mountain tune from the fields, hence the name "Kao Shan." Later, it flowed into the cities, and it is now commonly sung in Luozi halls. It is accompanied only by a sanxian, with a slow and circuitous melody, with few connections between words. At the end of each sentence, there is often a very long pause, and the singer often sings loudly, the higher the better, which still retains the original meaning of a mountain song. The lyrics are purely narrative, divided into sections of varying lengths, but before the last sentence of each section, there is always the empty phrase "Ai Ai Ai Ai Yo," which is quite similar to folk songs in other regions. The content of the lyrics is nothing more than love between men and women. Among them, "A Forked Pole" and "A Ball" are the most popular. The so-called "forked pole" is a term used in the North to refer to a prostitute's lover who has the resources to protect her. The lyrics tell the story of a secret meeting between a prostitute and her lover, but there is a lot of local dialect, and it is difficult to understand the meaning without annotations.

### In the Same Boat

— He Jia Zhi

(6) A Snap of the Fingers

Weicheng said: "They're here, what are they talking about?" Cuizhen said: "They talk about everything, the homework in school; clothes, what's fashionable; vegetables, which store is cheaper; movies, which one is new, which one is old (I feel like I'm in a foreign country, I don't understand much of what they say)." Weicheng laughed and asked: "Cuizhen, how is it eating at the Chen's house?" Cuizhen said: "I eat with Miss Chen. I asked Miss Chen, if I hadn't come to Shanghai, would you have eaten alone? She said, she eats with them." Weicheng said: "The food must be very good?" Cuizhen said: "It is. I was thinking, maybe Miss Chen specially told the cook, or maybe she gave the cook a bonus."

Weicheng then said: "After you left, didn't Guofang go to XXX anymore?" Cuizhen said: "She went for two and a half days. I saw that she spent time talking and playing with me, forgetting all about her studies. I felt too uneasy, so I had to come back. Weicheng, how can Miss Chen be so nice? I was thinking, it's possible for a country girl to go to Shanghai and be looked down upon. Meeting Miss Chen, I really wouldn't have dreamed of it." Cuizhen's joy was evident on her face. Weicheng laughed and said: "Miss Chen's kindness is partly because she likes Cuizhen. Cuizhen, you've returned to the countryside now. The impressions of Shanghai must be deeply imprinted in your mind?" Cuizhen said: "I'll never forget it; that foreign XXX, what's it called, French food, you have to use a knife to eat it; and that white cloth, where people can appear and talk; I've seen it all. But Weicheng, the booming sound of the wheels is still in my XXX, and people who grow up in the countryside should stay in the countryside. After living there for a few days, I started to miss the countryside." Cuizhen saw that Weicheng was closing his eyes, as if he was about to doze off, and stood up to leave. Weicheng opened his eyes and smiled: "You talk, I'm listening, I find it very interesting." Cuizhen said: "There's nothing to say today, I'll talk tomorrow. Has my uncle come these past few days?" Weicheng replied without thinking: "No. I believe he should have realized it too, and he won't come anymore." (107)
