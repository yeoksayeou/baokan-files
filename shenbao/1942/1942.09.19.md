Tokyo, 18th (Domei News Agency)

Today marks the 11th anniversary of the September 18th Manchurian Incident. At a time when the Greater East Asia War is scoring successive victories and the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere has already laid a solid foundation, its significance is profound and immense. Japan is expanding commemorative events nationwide today. At 9:40 a.m. on the 18th, Li Shaogeng, the Manchurian Ambassador to Japan, visited the Yasukuni Shrine. Military bands of the Army and Navy paraded in Tokyo with melodious music. At 1:00 p.m., an overseas compatriots' speech and declaration meeting was held at the Hibiya Public Hall. At 7:00 p.m. that evening, Okumura, the Vice Director of the Information Bureau, broadcast on the Tokyo radio station, praising Manchuria and elaborating on the commemorative significance. Simultaneously, the 35 ward veterans' associations, the Greater Japan Women's Association, youth schools, and young adult groups in the entire city also separately launched commemorative ceremonies.

### Tojo's Speech

Tokyo, 18th (Domei News Agency)

A luncheon co-sponsored by the 10th Anniversary Celebration of the Founding of Manchukuo, the Great Political People's Support Association, and the Greater Japan Asian Development Alliance was held at the Imperial Hotel at noon today. Prime Minister Tojo delivered a speech on the spot, briefly stating that the development of Manchukuo over the past decade has been rapid, its national foundation is becoming more solid, and its national destiny is flourishing. It shoulders the heavy responsibility of defending the northern borders in cooperation with our country. During this Greater East Asia War, Manchukuo is advancing towards the ideal of achieving common goals, which we deeply admire. Recalling the Manchurian Incident eleven years ago, it was a process of the development of Manchukuo. In addition to wholeheartedly wishing it great development, we also express our deep respect to all allied nations that recognize Manchukuo and extend sincere friendship. On this auspicious occasion of the 10th anniversary of the founding of our allied nation, we will join hands with our allied nations and march side by side towards the path of final victory.

### Okumura's Broadcast

Tokyo, 18th (Domei News Agency)

Okumura Kiwao, Vice Director of the Japanese Information Bureau, delivered a commemorative broadcast at 7:30 p.m. on the 18th on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the recognition of Manchukuo. The gist of the broadcast stated that recalling the September 18th Manchurian Incident ten years ago up to today's World War, one increasingly feels that the Manchurian Incident has its historical significance for the world. Tracing back to the Meiji Restoration in Japan, it was not only a national reform but also, from a world historical perspective, the beginning of a counterattack against the aggressors of England, the United States, France, Russia, and Japan. Subsequently, Japan's national power increased day by day, and the pressure from England and the United States on Japan also intensified. The pressure reached its peak, and the Manchurian Incident occurred. Therefore, according to past history, the occurrence of the Manchurian Incident was also a prelude to the world's war of restoration and was by no means accidental. Subsequently, in the early days of the founding of Manchukuo, Japan and Manchukuo were repeatedly obstructed and oppressed by England and the United States. However, for ten years, Manchukuo has been steadily developing, recognized by more than a dozen countries, and has become an independent country in name and reality. It is also a stronghold for defending Asia. Counting from Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations in Showa 8 (1933) until the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War last winter, the three countries of Japan, Germany, and Italy formed the Axis from the Anti-Comintern Pact, which has a decisive force in the new world order. The old world of England and the United States cannot help but decline because of this. Therefore, the Manchurian Incident, on the one hand, promoted the formation of the new order forces of Japan, Germany, and Italy, and on the other hand, also promoted the decline of Anglo-American democracy and was a precursor to today's world restoration war. Furthermore, on July 7th of Showa 12 (1937), with the outbreak of the Lugouqiao Incident, Japan, in order to thoroughly resolve the incident, had no choice but to resolutely declare war on England and the United States. We, looking forward to the future of the war, must have an even greater sense of awareness. On this occasion of celebrating the 10th anniversary of the founding of Manchukuo, I would like to briefly express my feelings on the evening of the anniversary of the incident.

### Yokoyama's Remarks

Domei News Agency reports that Yokoyama, the Director of the Press Department, solemnly stated that the war that evolved from the Manchurian Incident was launched to confront the blindness and power politics of Western powers. He also asserted that the political developments that came with the war laid the foundation for establishing a new world order. In an interview with reporters from the Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun, Director Yokoyama blamed the United States and the League of Nations for oppressing Japan when the incident occurred, and Japan could not know its mistakes and correct them at that time. Mr. Yokoyama, who was in the Press Department of the Kwantung Army at that time, believed that the progress of Manchuria over the past decade was a model area for China, which was always his aspiration. To enhance friendly relations between the two countries, he advocated mutual visits between young people, especially mutual exchanges to gain goodwill and understanding.

### The Road to Reviving East Asia: Written for the 9/18 Anniversary

— Wang Zhaoming

From the very beginning of the peace movement, we have had a firm belief: that all the nations of East Asia must work together to revive East Asia, and that each nation of East Asia must strive to make itself a strong member in the revival of East Asia. Only then will the sum of these forces appear great.

One plus one equals one, and one hundred ones added together equals one hundred. But one plus many zeros still equals one. On the other hand, one hundred ones added together equals one hundred, but if they are separated, each is only worth one. This is a very simple common sense, and I think everyone knows it very well. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, with the passage of time, our belief has become more and more correct. Modern warfare is total warfare, and we must use all our strength to win the final victory. Furthermore, we must not only use all the strength we have now, but also use the strength we have now to create a greater, newer force, and then use the sum of the old and new forces to strive for the final victory. How can we build up this sum of strength and put it to use? The answer comes back to the two paths: individual effort and joint cooperation.

The Sino-Japanese peace movement, on the one hand, aims to end the war and eliminate the mutual offset of internal forces in East Asia. However, the significance of the peace movement lies not only in this negative aspect, but especially in the positive aspect of building China and reviving East Asia. Therefore, we have long said that the peace movement is a revolutionary movement. This meaning is even more important now after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War.

Modern national total warfare places equal importance on human resources and material resources. Material resources can be said to be static resources, while human resources are dynamic resources. If material strength is not driven by human strength, then static strength cannot be expressed. Before this World War, people generally overestimated the material strength of Britain and the United States. Now, on the one hand, the paper tiger has been exposed, and on the other hand, the war has changed the original situation. Not to mention Britain, even the United States is visibly declining. Now, the forces of Britain and the United States have been driven out of the East Asian region. East Asia originally had huge human and material resources, and during the Greater East Asia War, it has added a lot of human and material resources. The question now is how to use this huge human power to drive this huge material power. If our East Asian nations can, based on the principles of individual effort and joint cooperation, intensify their efforts to build a brand-new East Asia with our huge human power to drive our huge material power, then the forces of Anglo-American aggression will never be able to raise their heads, and the bright future of East Asia will be like the sun at its zenith, forever shining on the earth. Therefore, although there may be many paths to revive East Asia when analyzed, these different paths all lead to the same wide road: the individual and joint cooperation of East Asian nations.

### Fire Lights Up Stalingrad, Fierce Street Fighting Continues, Soviets Transport Reinforcements by Plane

Moscow, 17th (Havas News Agency)

Official sources recently announced that an enemy unit has entered Stalingrad, and fierce street fighting has broken out and has not yet ceased.

Stockholm, Sweden, 18th (Havas News Agency)

The battle for Stalingrad has lasted for twenty-five days, and fierce street fighting within the city has been ongoing for five days now. German forces entered from the south, west, and northwest, and the north has now switched to a defensive posture to respond to the defenders' fierce counterattacks. It is currently raining in the war zone of the city, but this has not had a significant impact on the war situation. The complete occupation of the city is only a matter of time.

Rome, 18th (Havas News Agency)

Italian newspaper war correspondents reported today that the Soviet military authorities are using airplanes to transport reinforcements to the Stalingrad front. However, many of these airplanes are being shot down by German planes.

Ankara, 18th (Haitong News Agency)

According to reports from Moscow today, the defending forces of Stalingrad have received reinforcements from Siberian troops.

Stockholm, Sweden, 18th (Havas News Agency)

The Stalingrad front is still in chaotic fighting. Although the German side has transferred defending forces and the situation of the defending forces is desperate, the defending forces are resisting as strongly as ever and have launched fierce counterattacks in the northwest and other areas. Every house in the city is a fortress, and every ruin is a machine gun nest. The positions of the German and Soviet armies are sometimes only a street apart, so small daredevil teams often detour to the rear of the enemy to attack. Moscow is not optimistic about the situation in the city. The north, south, and central roads are all in a precarious situation, but it is hoped that the resistance can be delayed for a few more days. In short, the battle for the city is becoming increasingly fierce, and casualties on both sides are extremely heavy. According to a German newspaper war correspondent's report yesterday, the situation in the front-line hospitals is busy, with medical personnel performing surgery and bandaging wounds day and night without stopping, and some are collapsing from exhaustion. Such personnel deserve a glorious page in the history of this thrilling battle.

Berlin, 17th (Havas News Agency)

German war correspondents recently reported from the front lines on the fierce battle in Stalingrad, stating that on a certain morning, the German army began to attack, and the roar of artillery was deafening. However, the Red Army stubbornly resisted, using various methods to try to hold out for a long time. Our army also attacked with all its strength, showing courage and perseverance. Although they have been engaged in fierce fighting on the battlefield for several weeks and have not rested at night, they firmly believe that the city will eventually fall and show no fear of difficulty. It was seen that the defensive fortifications near the city were just destroyed by our army, and the enemy army immediately implemented a charge with T34-type tanks weighing twenty-four tons. Special units of our army also rushed to participate in the battle, and the enemy army was finally repelled. The airfield near the city has been bombed by our aircraft and is unusable. Our army's artillery opened fire to bombard the enemy's barracks, and the enemy's artillery on the left bank of the Volga River and in the city also bombarded our army. Before long, the enemy vehicles even attacked us with tanks. When our aircraft were dispatched, the enemy's mechanized units were finally forced to retreat. In short, the victory or defeat of this battle will be determined by the infantry's battle, and the number of reserve forces is the key. For the enemy army, they have already transferred their last forces to the battlefield. According to the captives, their ranks have been fighting continuously for several days without sleep, exhausted and tired. At noon, our army captured a town near Stalingrad, and only a few houses in the entire town remained. Looking at the city from afar, thick smoke billowed and fire lit up the sky, like a fiery hell, and the residents of the city were destined to perish with the army. At this time, our army headquarters ordered a second attack. At this time, because the enemy was exhausted, their artillery fire was not as fierce as before, so our army pursued the defeated enemy and was unusually smooth. At half past twelve in the evening, our army attacked a factory on a high ground near the city. At fifteen minutes past three the next morning, our army reached its destination. At this point, our army was only five hundred yards from the city. All kinds of houses were clearly visible. Looking up at the sky, thick smoke filled the air, and no sunlight could be seen. It was impossible to tell whether the sky was clear or cloudy, and even close to our person, there were still flickering flames.

### Willkie Arrives in Kuibyshev, Reportedly to Go to Moscow to Meet Stalin and Others

Kuibyshev, 17th (Central News Agency)

Roosevelt's envoy Willkie arrived in Kuibyshev by plane on the 17th from Tehran. Willkie had a long conversation with Iranian King Pahlavi in Tehran.

He is scheduled to transfer to Chongqing immediately after his stay in the Soviet Union.

Ankara, 18th (Haitong News Agency)

Reports received here yesterday stated that Roosevelt's envoy Willkie has flown from Tehran to Kuibyshev.

### Changes in the Boundary of the Cleansing Area in the Southeast Area of Taihu Lake

Jiaxing, 18th (Central News Agency)

Regarding the issue of the boundary of the second phase of the cleansing area in the southeast of Taihu Lake, the Zhejiang Office has made slight changes. The Jiaxing urban area is under the management of the Erjia Special District. Haiyan, from Xiashi along the railway to Dingqiao, and Haigai, from Dongshan to Zhangjiadang, are divided by waterways and are under the jurisdiction of the Haiyan District. A section of the southwest corner of Pinghu to the bridge is also temporarily under the jurisdiction of Haiyan, with waterways as the boundary. Zhujia Town in Songjiang is under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai District. After the completion of the cleansing, the original county field boundaries will still be the boundary.

### Soviet Paradise - Caucasus (2)

Various races

The Caucasus is known for its diverse ethnic groups living together. In terms of its small area, there is probably no place in the world that is home to more types of ethnic groups than the Caucasus.

The population of the Caucasus is said to total 12 million, including Russians, Tatars, Armenians, Kartvelians, Gorans, Ossetians, Iranians, Kurds, Greeks, and Jews.

The Russians in the Caucasus are the Cossacks living in the Kuban and Terek River basins of the Inner Caucasus, numbering about three million.

Apart from the Russians, there are not many Iranians, Greeks, and Jews. The most numerous are the Gorans, Kartvelians, and Ossetians, who can only be seen in the Caucasus.

The Gorans total one million, most of whom live on both sides of the central Caucasus Mountains. Therefore, the Gorans are commonly known as mountain residents. This ethnic group is divided into various small ethnic groups, including the Lezgins, Chechens, and Ingush living in the eastern part of the central mountains, and the Circassians, Kabardins, and Karachays living in the western part.

The Gorans are a people of medium stature, with solid physiques and agile movements. Their character is quite upright and their attitude is gentle, but they are emotionally sensitive and vengeful. Therefore, when Imperial Russia attempted to annex the Caucasus, it was repeatedly obstructed by the Gorans. The Caucasus Guard (mostly organized by Cossacks) suffered great sacrifices due to constant attacks by Goran cavalry. They are skilled in horseback riding in mountainous areas, and even the Cossacks, who are known for their cavalry skills in the world, can only sigh in admiration. The Gorans treated their pursuit as if it were a game. The Gorans also have many beauties, and the black-eyed and black-haired women have made many Russian officers fall under their skirts. How many beautiful romances have blossomed in the mountains of the Caucasus? The poet Pushkin and the literary giant Tolstoy left many famous works dealing with these romances.

Customs and Habits

The clothing of the Gorans is very unique and beautiful. The men wear high hats made of sheepskin, long coats with long hems, and thin belts decorated with silver. On this belt, they must insert a dagger.

Their houses are small houses made of stones without chimneys. The roofs are flat, so the roofs can be used as patios or balconies. In the summer, the Gorans sleep on these roofs. The Gorans believe in Islam.

The Kartvelians are also divided into several small ethnic groups, including the Georgians, Imeretians, Gurelians, Mingrelians, Svanetians, Laz, Khevsurs, Tushins, and Pshavs. Most of them live in the deep mountains. Like the Gorans, their appearance is also quite beautiful. Religiously, they believe in Orthodox Christianity.

The Armenians live scattered throughout the Caucasus, but most of them are concentrated on the Armenian Plateau. The Armenians are the most wealthy and enterprising people in the Caucasus. It can be said that the industry and commerce of the Caucasus are almost entirely in the hands of the Armenians. They believe in a syncretic Christianity that combines Catholicism and Orthodox Christianity.

The Tatars live in the southeast of the Caucasus because it is Azerbaijan, which is located near the border of the Caucasus. Therefore, they are also called Azerbaijan's Tatars.

The Greeks and Turks live in various places along the Black Sea coast, while the Iranians live on the Apsheron Peninsula.

### Madagascar Defenders Continue Resistance, Reject British Terms

Vichy, 17th (Havas News Agency)

The defenders of French Madagascar continue to resist firmly. The number of British troops is still greater than that of the defenders, but their advance towards the capital has slowed down. It was heard this morning that the advance units of the British army have reached the vicinity of Mahajipo City, which is still 150 miles away from the capital. The governor has decided to defend Madagascar to the end. Although the British army has a large number of troops and superior equipment, they have only advanced 120 miles in seven days.

### New Japanese Foreign Minister Masazumi Tani Makes Statement to the Press, Will Implement Basic Policies, Maintain Japanese-Soviet Relations, Kazuo Aoki Concurrently Appointed Minister of State

Tokyo, 17th (Domei News Agency)

Cabinet Information Bureau Director Masazumi Tani, by order of the Japanese Emperor, concurrently assumed the position of Foreign Minister this morning in the Phoenix Hall, presiding over the personal appointment ceremony. At the same time, Aoki assumed the position of Minister of State. Foreign Minister Tani immediately went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 4:30 p.m. to take over his duties. As for the new Minister of State Aoki, he may be in charge of the affairs of the Greater East Asia Ministry.

Tokyo, 17th (Domei News Agency)

The new Foreign Minister Masazumi Tani declared to the press this afternoon that he would implement the current basic diplomatic policies and maintain diplomatic relations between Japan and the Soviet Union. Once the Greater East Asia Ministry is established, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will focus on purely diplomatic affairs. Japan will respect the sovereignty and independence of each country within the Co-Prosperity Sphere. He stated that respect for the independence of a country should not be confused with the common relationship between construction and Japan. In other words, in terms of construction, the countries of Greater East Asia are actually one.

Tokyo, 18th (Domei News Agency)

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced this afternoon that Deputy Vice Foreign Minister Taiichi Yamamoto has been appointed as Vice Foreign Minister to assist Foreign Minister Masazumi Tani. This appointment was recommended by Mr. Tani.

### Japanese Newspaper Commentary

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency)

The importance of wartime diplomacy is already self-evident. Therefore, the Japanese government's appointment of Masazumi Tani as a full-time Foreign Minister, while still serving as the Director-General of the Information Bureau, is highly anticipated by the newspapers here. For example, the Asahi Shimbun's editorial stated that the diplomatic war should not be underestimated in its significance as a supplementary means to the military war. Therefore, in promoting this wartime diplomacy, Foreign Minister Tani's mission is extremely important. Moreover, he is still concurrently the Director-General of the Information Bureau and is responsible for internal and external propaganda. Therefore, it is deeply hoped that each new Foreign Minister will move forward with loyalty and effort to establish the authority and credibility of the Empire's diplomacy. The Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun stated that at a time when the Empire's prestige is growing day by day, the contact aspects of the Empire's diplomacy are expanding. However, it is difficult to achieve the desired goals by relying solely on the Foreign Minister. Therefore, it is especially hoped that the entire Ministry of Foreign Affairs will make efforts and activities. The Yomiuri Hochi stated that the new Foreign Minister Tani has been the Director-General of the Information Bureau since the current Cabinet was established last year and has participated in internal and external policies during the war. This time, he is participating in pure diplomatic affairs. His practical knowledge of participating in wartime affairs will definitely be of great benefit to the promotion of future diplomacy. Furthermore, the Asahi Shimbun's editorial commented on Kazuo Aoki's appointment as Minister of State, stating that Mr. Aoki is a veteran financial official from the Ministry of Finance, and everyone is happy to have him in the Cabinet this time. Furthermore, the editorial concluded that the current Cabinet's quick decision to appoint a Minister is proof of its decisiveness, and it will launch its war guidance and engage in the promotion of the domestic system with full steps. This is indeed deeply anticipated.

### No Worries About Coal Shortages, Direct Distribution to Users, Authorities Compile Distribution, Strictly Prohibit Resale

As the harsh winter approaches, citizens are deeply concerned about the shortage of coal fuel. However, according to reporter investigations, the current inventory of white coal and bituminous coal in this port is at least 700,000 tons, mostly designated by the authorities to be stacked in major warehouses in Hongkou, Pudong, Western Shanghai, and the French Concession. Without a permit issued by the authorities in advance, transportation is not allowed. This inventory, combined with the large amount of advance purchases and storage by citizens themselves for reserve, is sufficient for six months of needs. The Coal System Compilation Committee of the two concessions purchased approximately 300,000 tons of white coal blocks and briquettes from coal-producing areas a month ago, which will be transported to Shanghai by freight train from various regions of North China and Central China and fairly distributed by the current Coal Industry Trust, the Da Zhong Lian Coal Company, to the registered major coal companies. It is found that the registered coal users include approximately 1,000 large and small coal companies, coal briquette factories, and firewood and charcoal shops. The daily consumption of each household is determined by the authorities, and the monthly supply is provided accordingly. If any resale for profit is found, the registration qualification will be revoked and the supply will be cut off after investigation. According to reports, under strict control of the source of coal, there is no fear of a shortage in the short term, and the price is also restricted and cannot be raised for profit.

### Strict Security Yesterday on 9/18

Yesterday was the 9/18 incident anniversary, and both concessions tightened security, especially the French Concession, which was even more stringent. In addition to dispatching Chinese and French detectives to check pedestrians at key passes, major roads were also closed. From 8:00 a.m. yesterday, the Dongxin Bridge Street exit, which had not been closed, was also uniformly set up with iron wire netting to implement interception. Iron wire netting frames were also installed in the middle of the road at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and the Great World, and pedestrians were divided into left and right lanes for detectives to inspect. Each iron gate bordering the Nanshi area was temporarily dispatched with several female frisking squads to conduct selective checks on male and female pedestrians suspected of being suspicious. From morning to night, both concessions passed in peace, and this special security is generally expected to be completely lifted today.

### Distribution of Ration Rice Changed to Once Every Ten Days

The Bureau of Public Works recently issued a notice stating that the No. 11 coupons for purchasing Bureau rice and flour are only valid until the 19th of this month and will expire after that.

At that time, the rice shop with the registration number indicated on the coupons will sell one and a half liters of white rice and half a liter of broken rice for each coupon, with a total selling price of five yuan. At the same time, the coupon holder may also purchase one catty of flour at will, with a selling price of two yuan and three corners.

The French authorities announced that the validity period of each coupon for rice purchase coupons will be changed from one week to ten days starting from the 12th period. The Bureau of Public Works Information Office announced that the validity period of each coupon, starting from the No. 12 coupons for rice purchase coupons, will be changed from one week to ten days. A special announcement is hereby made in the hope that all citizens will pay attention to it.

### After the Lifting of the Curfew

The curfew is the shadow of prosperity, the alarm bell of nightlife, the reef of entertainment industry. Some people have said this.

Recently, the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Settlement announced that due to the effectiveness of the public security system and the organization of self-defense corps, the curfew will be lifted from the 16th of this month. Citizens must carry their citizen's cards at all times, otherwise they will be questioned or detained by the patrolmen. At the same time, the French Concession Board of Directors also announced that once the public security organization is completed and identity cards are widely issued, it will take the same measures as the Public Settlement, and hinted that the period is not far away and can be realized in a few weeks.

Let's recall that the curfew in the two concessions was implemented after the war, lasting for nearly six years in total. In the past, Shanghai's night market could truly be described as a city that never sleeps. The lights and decorations of the shops were always on. Theaters ended performances after 1:00 AM, dance halls and bars closed at least at 2:00 AM, and restaurants open all night were everywhere. Convenience, stimulation, and excitement created a love and vitality for citizens' nightlife. Later, with the sound of gunfire, martial law was implemented. Entertainment venues were all closed after 12:00 PM, and traffic was prohibited on the roads. The flourishing night market suddenly turned into a desolate scene.

Although the curfew has now been lifted, it will actually take a considerable amount of time for the night market to return to its pre-war state. This is because the economic strength of the general public is not as vibrant as before the war, and under the principle of electricity rationing by the authorities, the closing time of entertainment venues and all materials sufficient for a city that never sleeps are subject to strict restrictions. Therefore, this lifting of the curfew may only be a sign of prosperity.

The news of the lifting of the curfew has been generally welcomed by citizens, because at least they are not restricted by the curfew when necessary. However, some people are concerned that pig rustlers and petty thieves will become active again after winter. However, it can be asserted that the increasingly tight organization of the self-defense corps and the implementation of all-night sentry duty will have a security effect no less than that of the curfew.

### Case of Fraudulent Procurement of Money Through Fictitious Business Names Still Under Investigation, Yao Yongtao Describes the Details of Each Case

Shanghai native Yao Yongtao (resident at 85 Dunxin Road), Cheng Qingquan (resident at 6, Lane 40, Saint Mary's Road), and Nanxun native Shi Bosun (resident at 3, Lane 6, Xiaoshadu Road, from a prominent Nanxun family; his father once served as the general manager of a certain bank) pooled 10,000 yuan a month ago to open the Dewei Trading Company in Room 209 of the Sassoon House on the Bund, Nanjing Road. The three of them usually acted lavishly, and the places they frequented were all the most luxurious in Shanghai, as detailed in previous reports.

### Fraudulent Pretext

Their actions contained various meanings: Firstly, their lavish behavior was used to show that they were all wealthy people. Secondly, the fact that their office was located in Sassoon House implied that they had strong capital, because in the minds of general merchants, anyone who rented a room in Sassoon House must possess substantial assets. Based on these two reasons, various firms were willing to deliver goods without requiring cash payment. Recently, because the 10,000 yuan check paid by the company to Qiu Hanming of Hongda Trading Company in Room 301 of Cishu Building, Nanjing Road, for the purchase of 50 dozen rubber soles could not be cashed, the case was reported to the Central Police Station, and Detective Cheng Renkun arrested Yao, Cheng, and Shi. Under investigation, in addition to the Hongda case, there were five other similar cases. Many of the plaintiffs are also well-known young masters in society.

### Cases Committed

The cases include: 1) On August 31st, purchased rubber soles worth 12,400 yuan from Ma Jiying (younger brother of Ma, the small owner of the Wu Palace Hotel), the manager of Zhongxing Trading Company, and the check paid could not be cashed. 2) On August 31st, purchased 20 cartons of cigarettes worth 900 yuan from Cheng Yihong (a famous handsome man), an employee of the British American Tobacco Company, in Room 219 of Sassoon House, and the check paid also could not be cashed. 3) On August 12th, cashed a check for 3,600 yuan at Zhongnan Trading Company, 266 Beijing Road, and the check was also returned. 4) From August 21st to 30th, took dancing girls and others to dinner at the Red Cotton Restaurant on Avenue Edward VII, totaling 671 yuan, and the check paid was also dishonored. 5) On August 7th, borrowed 5,000 yuan from Qian Dan in Room 509 of the International Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road, and the check given afterwards was also returned. According to the total calculation, the checks issued for the above six cases amounted to more than 30,000 yuan.

### Defendant's Confession

The company's deposit in the bank was only 20 yuan. All the notes were signed by Yao Yongtao. As for the position of the company, Cheng Qingquan was the general manager, Yao Yongtao was the manager, and Shi was only a clerk. The police filed a public prosecution on the above cases yesterday. According to Yao's confession, the payments to Qiu, Ma, Cheng, etc., were not for goods but were owed debts. The payment to the Red Cotton Restaurant was stopped because the restaurant treated guests arrogantly. Shi Bosun confessed that he was only an employee of Dewei Company and knew nothing about what Yao and others had done and had no right to advise. Therefore, he could not bear any responsibility for this case. Because the details of the case still needed to be investigated, the order was given to reschedule the hearing.

### Formal Public Bond Meeting; Bandit Yao Tongsheng Emits Twelve Numbers Have Been Seen In Huagu, But Public Utilities Are Still Progressing

The public bond market has temporarily suspended meetings due to the handling of handover and registration procedures. There may be two or three colleagues who negotiate prices with each other that are not uniform, but in general, there is little difference. Yesterday, the situation suddenly took a flying leap, and the spring scenery was full of gardens, and the concept of a red apricot branch coming out of the wall was like a vague image. The good scenery is limited by human power. The market price is different and the transaction is limited. It is estimated that the colleagues will hold a meeting this afternoon and probably the market meeting can be announced within a few days.

The 13th lottery for the return of principal of the Republic of China 25th Year Unified Public Bond E was held on June 10th. The lottery drew twelve numbers: 58139246270351376439530641780827930
