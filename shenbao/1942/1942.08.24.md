### Brazil President Signs Order Declaring War on Germany and Italy

Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 22nd (Havas) – President Vargas signed an order at 3 PM today, declaring a state of war between Brazil and Germany and Italy. He also instructed overseas envoys to immediately notify the governments of their respective host countries of this decision, stating that "the development of the situation to this point is the inevitable result of the acts of war taken by Germany and Italy against Brazilian ships." However, Brazil had already severed diplomatic ties with the Axis powers, so the governments of Spain and Switzerland will relay this decision to the German and Italian governments. Regarding the "state of war," the Brazilian government issued a public statement to explain its value, stating, "After declaring a state of war, our country will do everything possible and take all measures. If the Axis powers further violate the sovereignty, freedom, and security of our country and the American continent, our country will surely repel them together."

Buenos Aires, Argentina, 23rd (Allied News) – Brazil announced yesterday that it had entered a state of war with the Axis powers, Germany and Italy. The Brazilian government's declaration of war was handed over to the Argentine envoy in Rio de Janeiro and the Brazilian embassy in Switzerland for transmission. Brazil has had six ships sunk by Axis submarines in recent weeks, hence this step. Authoritative sources believe this declaration of war is only against Germany and Italy, not against Japan. The Brazilian ambassador in Washington stated that Brazil's relationship with Japan is the same as the Soviet Union's, i.e., technical neutrality. It is widely believed that several South American countries will follow Brazil's lead. Regarding this declaration of war, the Brazilian government's official statement roughly stated, "We are facing a war that violates our sovereignty, and we believe that Brazil is in a state of war with Germany and Italy. Diplomatic notifications have been sent to the two countries by the appropriate authorities," etc. Last night, the crowd in the Brazilian capital was very excited. News leaked out, and there was much discussion in the streets. After the announcement was made, Brazilian Minister of War Dutra immediately notified the Brazilian troops, saying, "Every Brazilian soldier must fulfill his responsibilities and know how to sacrifice his life for Brazil. Recognize the facts and use all the strength we can to resist the attack," etc.

Buenos Aires, Argentina, 23rd (Allied News) – Brazil is the first South American country to formally join the war, while remaining neutral towards Japan. Brazil's participation in the war, but not against Japan, indicates that it declared war because of submarine attacks on Brazilian ships. Brazil declared war on Germany and Italy after the sixth Brazilian ship was sunk in its territorial waters.

Buenos Aires, Argentina, 23rd (Allied News) – According to news from the Brazilian capital, the Brazilian government has notified the governments of the other twenty countries in the Americas of the state of war with Germany and Italy. Also, Argentine President Castillo stated today while hosting journalists that the Argentine government is carefully studying the new situation created by Brazil's declaration of war.

### Germany Finds It Not Surprising, America Expresses Satisfaction

Berlin, 23rd (Haitong News) – Responsible figures in Berlin pointed out that rumors that Brazil and Uruguay have declared war on Germany and Italy, if true, are not surprising. Based on the recent actions of the two countries, it was known that this step was inevitable. The government has not yet received formal war notification, so the German Foreign Office has not yet commented on this matter.

Washington, 22nd (Havas) – Political figures here expressed great satisfaction upon learning that Brazil had declared war on Germany and Italy. The Brazilian ambassador to the United States visited Secretary of State Hull at the State Department this afternoon to inform him of the decision taken by his government. President Roosevelt immediately cabled President Vargas to express his satisfaction with this decision, saying that it "is no less than a reaffirmation of the solidarity of the American countries."

Lisbon, 23rd (Haitong News) – Political circles here are deeply surprised by Brazil's declaration of war on Germany and Italy, because they do not believe that the United States' influence on Brazil is so great as to cause President Vargas to make this decision. Portugal expresses disappointment at the expansion of the war. Firstly, Portugal and Brazil have been becoming increasingly close culturally and economically during the war, and secondly, it is believed that after Brazil joins the Allied camp, the anti-Bolshevik stance at the heart of Brazil's domestic politics will change. Political circles here point out that Portugal's strict adherence to anti-communist policies is enough to alienate the two countries.

### Rumors of Uruguay Following Suit and Declaring War

Lisbon, 23rd (Allied News) – According to unconfirmed news from London, Uruguay has followed Brazil and declared war on Germany and Italy. Because Uruguay signed a joint action agreement with Brazil a few days ago, this step is necessary.

Lisbon, 23rd (Haitong News) – Lisbon Radio announced last night that Uruguay has followed in Brazil's footsteps and declared war on Germany and Italy.

Lisbon, 23rd (Haitong News) – The London "Daily Telegraph" commented on the situation in India this morning, saying that suppressing the movement of the All-India Congress Party will not be successful in the short term. According to the various news received in recent days, the actions of Indian freedom fighters are quite planned.

Saigon, 23rd (Haitong News) – According to news received here, Lord Mudalier, Prime Minister of Travancore, India, has appealed to all parties in India to stop fighting each other. It is said that all parties in India must work together to fight for India's independence.

In the Kara district, four university students were seriously injured and ten were slightly injured. In Bikaner, the atmosphere is tense.

### Washington Announces Willkie's Trip to Chongqing, Met with Song Ziwen Yesterday

Lisbon, 23rd (Allied News) – Washington news, yesterday Washington officially announced that in addition to visiting the Soviet Union and the Near East, Willkie will also go to Chongqing. Yesterday morning, Willkie met with Song Ziwen and other Chongqing officials stationed in the United States. A White House spokesman said that the President's description of Willkie's itinerary on Friday, which did not mention Chongqing, was an oversight.

Istanbul, Turkey, 22nd (Havas) – It is reported that American Republican leader Willkie, while visiting Europe and the Near East, will come to Turkey on his way, and will present President Inonu with a private letter from President Roosevelt at that time.

Lisbon, 23rd (Haitong News) – According to Washington's announcement last night, Willkie will also visit Chongqing in addition to visiting the Middle East and Moscow. A White House spokesman said that President Roosevelt omitted mentioning Chongqing when announcing Willkie's trip abroad. Willkie discussed everything with Chinese Foreign Minister Song Ziwen and other Chinese dignitaries in Washington.

Comments from the German Foreign Office Spokesperson

Berlin, 23rd (Haitong News) – A spokesman for the German Foreign Office declared that Germany welcomes Willkie's visit to Moscow and various parts of Europe, because the more places Willkie visits, the more the prestige of the United States will decline. The White House is also touting Willkie's long trip, because Willkie's trip abroad can reduce competition during the autumn elections.

### Germany Invents Block-Shaped Dried Milk, Can Stay Fresh for Up to Six Months

Berlin, 23rd (Haitong News) – German hotels and cafes will use square-shaped dried milk in the near future.

This block-shaped milk can stay fresh for up to six months and saves more space than powdered milk. The first factory for manufacturing block-shaped milk will be established in the Holstein region this year.

### Germany Will Use Paratroopers to Take the Offensive in Egypt, Some Regiments Have Been Transferred to North Africa, British Army Is Also Preparing for a Major Battle

Stockholm, Sweden, 23rd (Allied News) – A correspondent for the London Times reported from the Western Desert that the German side is expected to use paratroopers to take the offensive in Egypt. It is rumored that some German paratrooper regiments have recently been transferred from Crete to North Africa and are currently serving as infantry on the front line. The correspondent believes that this is a sign that the German general Rommel intends to use paratroopers in the next offensive, and that the German paratroopers are currently serving as infantry to familiarize themselves with desert warfare in preparation for attacking Erbil. At the same time, General Rommel has withdrawn all his armored and infantry troops for reorganization. German reinforcements have now greatly increased, and the reorganization is complete. The silence of the desert warfare will cease at the next full moon, as it is the best time for tank and paratrooper operations. London has repeatedly reported that General Rommel has received a large number of reinforcements after the Battle of Mersa Matruh, and is preparing paratroopers and airborne transport troops in Rhodes. A British correspondent who inspected the entire Egyptian front line for three days said that the British Eighth Army is prepared to deal with everything at the full moon. There is now reason to believe that the strength of the Allied forces in Egypt has increased slightly in preparation for a renewed German offensive. The Allies have sent new forces, including American land and air forces, through the Mediterranean to Egypt to reinforce the Eighth Army. With both the Allied and Axis forces making these preparations, a major war in the Middle East and the Mediterranean seems imminent, and the Eastern Front and the situation in India may be affected by this major war.

Rome, 23rd (Haitong News) – An Italian military headquarters communique this afternoon stated that yesterday, reconnaissance teams were unusually active on the Egyptian battlefield, and enemy tanks that attacked our army were repelled. Enemy aircraft attacked our supply lines and four were shot down by German fighter planes. The anti-aircraft guns of our escort fleet shot down a British aircraft, which fell into the sea and the crew members were rescued.

Rome, 22nd (Havas) – Guetta recently published an article in an Italian newspaper, roughly saying that the enemy escort fleet that I encountered and dispersed by the Axis forces in the Strait of Sicily a week ago was actually more powerful than usual. The only explanation that can be made based on aerial photographs is that the British and American troops were trying to land somewhere in the Mediterranean at that time. As for the failure to land in Dieppe, this is the second time, but this does not mean that Churchill and Roosevelt will abandon this attempt. In fact, the opposite is true. There is now reason to believe that another move is being prepared in the Mediterranean, because the ports of Gibraltar and the British-controlled ports in the eastern Mediterranean are very active.

Berlin, 22nd (Havas) – Military figures here said that the British army's attempt to land on the west coast of Europe ended in a disastrous failure. The only areas where the war is going on are still the Soviet Union and Egypt. As far as the Soviet front is concerned, the German army and its allied forces continue to advance towards both the Caucasus and Stalingrad, and decisive events are expected to occur soon. The German General Staff is now keeping silent, which can be seen in the large-scale operations that are underway. As for the Egyptian front, there is no change in the lines between the two armies, but it is worth noting that escort fleets are now transporting military equipment and food to the German front in Egypt every day, and the British have no way to stop these merchant fleets, which shows that the Axis forces have an advantage in the Mediterranean. Once the time is ripe, the German army can resume its offensive on the Egyptian front at any time.

### Soviet Commander Novikov Going to Cairo from Iran

Rome, 23rd (Haitong News) – It is reported here that the Soviet Union's commander-in-chief in Iran, Novikov, has departed from the Iranian capital for Cairo to visit General Alexander, commander-in-chief of the British forces in the Near East.

### German Planes Attack British Escort Fleet, London Has Not Confirmed

Lagos, Portugal, 22nd (Havas) – It is reported that a British merchant fleet consisting of eight cargo ships, escorted by several warships, was attacked by several aircraft of unknown nationality off the coast of Bugal in southern Portugal.

Lisbon, 23rd (Haitong News) – News from the port of Lagos on the southern coast of Portugal says that a British escort fleet of eight ships was attacked by German aircraft at ten o'clock yesterday morning. At that time, the sound of artillery and machine guns could be clearly heard in Lagos.

London, 22nd (Havas) – According to a Lisbon news report that a British escort fleet was attacked by aircraft of unknown nationality off the coast of Bugal, this claim could not be confirmed. According to well-informed British sources, a British bomber was forced to land near Cape St. Vincent, and the pilots were rescued by a British warship. This rumor was born from this incident.

### British Left-Wing Political Leaders Issue Declaration

Stockholm, Sweden, 23rd (Haitong News) – According to news from London, several British left-wing political leaders have issued a declaration of socialists on the goals of war and peace. The declaration, signed by thirteen Labour MPs, is addressed to "those who do not blindly hate the German people and hope to establish a just and lasting peace on the basis of socialism." The declaration includes the following six points regarding domestic and foreign policy: To make genuine sacrifices during the war. To return land and wealth to people of all classes. The socialization of banks, power plants and transport facilities. The liberation of India and other parts of the British Empire. To abolish national supremacy and power politics. To establish a socialist Britain as part of the United Socialist States of Europe, which will expand to become a socialist commonwealth of the world. The declaration has only been published by the London "Daily Mail" and "News Chronicle", and other newspapers do not pay much attention to it.

### Finland Accuses Soviet Union of Violating Hague Convention

Helsinki, 23rd (Haitong News) – According to an official announcement here yesterday, the Soviet government has refused the Finnish authorities to obtain information about the fate of Finnish prisoners. The International Committee of the Red Cross also stated that the Soviet government is unwilling to issue any statements. This attitude violates the provisions of the Hague Convention. To date, no Finnish prisoners have sent letters back to their country proving that they are still alive. As for the Finnish side, it has supplied the names and information of the prisoners to the Red Cross, but the Soviet Union is using Finnish prisoners as a propaganda tool, broadcasting letters to their relatives in Finnish on the radio, claiming that they are being treated very well in the Soviet Union.

Helsinki, 22nd (Havas) – Finance Minister Tanner said in a speech in Enso: "Our country has repeatedly rejected proposals for a separate peace with the Soviet Union and its allies. The Soviet Union has deceived itself more than once. Afterwards, it will be difficult to trust any treaty we conclude with our eastern neighbor, so we must work hard to fight until we achieve our goals and can ensure the future of our country and obtain lasting peace."

### The Outskirts of Stalingrad: Soviets Deploy Terraced Defenses; Battle Assumes Decisive Significance; Fierce Fighting Also in the Caucasus Mountains

Berlin, 23rd (Via Haitong News Agency) – While German and allied forces advance rapidly toward the Caucasus, fierce fighting has erupted near Stalingrad. Berlin’s silence on the fighting there indicates that the battle is of decisive significance. The German High Command refrains from issuing any statements to avoid providing intelligence to the enemy. However, it can be stated definitively that the battle in the Stalingrad area has entered a new phase. Currently, the fighting between the Don and Volga rivers is the most important on the entire Eastern Front. The German High Command announced that German fighter planes are participating in the fighting southwest of Stalingrad and east of the Don. This is the first official German announcement that the fighting has moved east of the Don. For several weeks, Soviet forces have been deploying terraced fortifications in the area, clearly intending to mount a fierce resistance. In the Caucasus region, German mountain troops are planting flags atop every mountain to facilitate defense. Soviet forces are also putting up fierce resistance in the mountains of the western Caucasus and at Black Sea ports, but new German victories are assured. A previous German war report revealed that Soviet forces lost many ships during their retreat from Black Sea ports. It is claimed that the German Air Force sank five transport ships and damaged eight others along the Black Sea coast. In addition, a large number of small boats and patrol vessels were sunk or damaged, bringing the total Soviet ship losses to fifty-five.

Rome, 23rd (Via Havas News Agency) – According to war correspondents from Italian newspapers at the front, the Axis forces are advancing rapidly and with relative ease on the Caucasus front. However, in Stalingrad and Orel, the Red Army is using strong fortifications to resist fiercely, attempting to halt the German advance. The fighting is exceptionally fierce.

Berlin, 23rd (Via Haitong News Agency) – German forces are successfully conducting mopping-up operations in the area between the Kuban River and the Black Sea in western Caucasus. After German and Romanian forces occupied Krinskaya and Kochinskaya, they continued their southward advance. Krinskaya, located on the railway line to Novorossiysk, is an important industrial center and a Soviet supply hub. Repeated Soviet counterattacks have been repelled. Kochinskaya was occupied by Romanian forces and is a strategic point connecting the Taman Peninsula and the Kuban region. The Soviet forces on the Taman Peninsula have had their retreat route cut off. The situation on the Kalmyk Steppe and between the Volga and Don rivers is exceptionally intense, but the authorities in charge have yet to release details.

The Threat to Anapa, the First Port in the Caucasus, Intensifies

Somewhere on the Ukrainian border, 23rd (Via Havas News Agency) – The Red Army’s resistance on the Black Sea coast has been greatly weakened. The Soviet Union began evacuating civilians ten days ago, and this has now been completed. East of Krinskaya, German vanguard units have reached a point twelve miles outside the port of Anapa. Once the Germans capture this port, it will essentially become the first port in the Caucasus occupied by German forces. Along the Sea of Azov coast, the Red Army continues to resist resolutely in several locations, but has been unable to stop the German advance. On the night of the 21st, the Soviet fleet attempted to pass through the Kerch Strait, but was spotted by German aircraft, which immediately bombed it. Two destroyers were also shelled by coastal artillery and forced to retreat. However, fierce fighting continues between the Don and Volga rivers. The Germans have successfully breached the outer defenses of Stalingrad for the second time. However, Soviet military authorities have concentrated large forces to defend this crucial Soviet center and are determined to hold it at all costs, regardless of the price. Consequently, the fighting there will not develop rapidly. Everything hinges on how General Bock maneuvers in the future.

Stockholm, Sweden, 23rd (Via Havas News Agency) – Significant developments are expected in various sectors of the Eastern Front, especially in the Stalingrad area and the Taman Peninsula, and are anticipated to materialize by the end of this week. The Germans are intensifying pressure on the port of Anapa, while also escalating their assault on Stalingrad. Yesterday, German vanguard units reportedly reached the city of Kaskogakovsky, though this has not been officially confirmed. In the Novorossiysk area, German vanguard units are only twenty-five miles from the Black Sea coast and have made contact with the city's outer defenses. Moscow has also admitted that Red Army units in the Caucasus regions are unable to transfer reinforcements due to transportation difficulties and are likely to continue withdrawing. As for the situation in the Stalingrad area, it is extremely fierce. According to Soviet sources, no fewer than fifty German divisions are engaged in the area, attacking the city from the south and west. The Soviet war bulletin last night reported that the Red Army had launched a series of large-scale counterattacks on the line. Although General Timoshenko's forces are resisting resolutely, their situation is quite difficult. The Soviet side hopes that the Red Army can hold the city until the onset of severe weather. If that is impossible, it is anticipated that the Germans will pay a very heavy price to occupy this party stronghold. In short, the issue will be resolved within a few days.

### From Lecturing to Imprisonment (5)

— Tie Ming

Therefore, when I got into trouble and had to flee in France, it was much easier than in England; perhaps easier than in any other country. I doubt that the landlady and Wang Xiaoer at the Jinbu Hotel would be able to recognize me, a foreigner, particularly clearly.

The next morning's *Le Temps* did not contain any news about the previous night. I called Mr. Zhang and told him that I was still out of danger, but had to leave Paris immediately. I arranged to meet him for lunch at the du Pont restaurant in the Latin Quarter. At the same time, I sneaked out of the hotel and bought a Paris *Midi* afternoon newspaper. I didn’t see anyone suspicious outside the hotel.

The afternoon newspaper reported the details. The driver of the car was blown up, and another person, presumably the one who fired the gun, was sent to the hospital with shoulder injuries and a fractured jaw. The landlady was also in the hospital, wounded by a pistol. Wang Xiaoer reported that he saw me throw a bomb into the car, but he did not mention where my bomb came from - making it really difficult to defend myself. Fortunately, they were not very accurate in their description of me and did not mention what nationality I was. Moreover, according to Wang Xiaoer, Martin and I spoke mostly in German, and my French seemed to have a Northern European accent.

Fortunately, the Jinbu Hotel was far away near the Porte de Vincennes. If it had been near the Champs-Élysées, Wang Xiaoer would have certainly claimed that the face of the person who threw the bomb seemed to be on a poster he had recently seen on the wall. That would have been terrible!

I decided to return to England immediately, so I went to Thomas Cook & Sons in Madeleine and bought a ticket to London, booking a seat on the 5 pm express train.

At the entrance of Thomas Cook, I saw a man with a small mustache, wearing a hard tweed hat, staring at me. I was shocked and quickly jumped into a taxi, quietly telling the driver to take me to the du Pont restaurant in the Latin Quarter. My voice was low, and the Madeleine area is one of the busiest in Paris. I didn't think the man with the mustache heard what I said. But after my car started, I saw him also get into a car and follow me. I didn't want to implicate Mr. Zhang, because he was going to stay in Paris for a long time. Secondly, I also wanted to shake off my pursuer, so on the Boulevard Saint-Germain, I asked the driver to change direction, not go to the Champs-Élysées, but turn towards the Gare du Luxembourg.

I wasn't very familiar with the Gare du Luxembourg. Only once, when I first arrived in Paris, I came out of a friend's house late at night, didn't know the way, so I took a suburban train from the station to Denfert-Rochereau and transferred to the underground to return to the hotel near the École Militaire. In a hurry, I went to the Luxembourg station and bought a ticket to Antony station. My pursuer was still skillfully following me, so I squeezed into the most crowded carriage. This suburban railway line goes underground in the Paris city center. The first stop is Port Royal, still in the bustling Montparnasse area of Paris. As soon as we arrived at that station, I rushed out. My pursuer was still following me. This time, I was lucky again. There was only one taxi at the station entrance. I jumped into the car and asked him to drive to the Institut Pasteur. At the same time, I crouched low in the car, fearing that my pursuer would be behind me. Fortunately, there were many pedestrians on the road, so he didn't chase recklessly. At the first corner, when I looked back, he was still running after me. I don't know when he stopped running. As I was about to reach the Institut Pasteur, I turned towards the Pasteur station. As I entered the station, a car rushed over, and I didn't have time to see who the passenger in the car was, so I hurried to the platform. There were four lines in this station, so even if the man in the car was that pursuer, he would probably take the wrong train.

I changed trains several times in the tunnel before reaching the du Pont, and it was already very late. Mr. Zhang was still waiting for me, and he had almost finished his meal. I told him that someone wanted to harm me and forced me to leave Paris immediately. He advised me to report to the police, but I didn't agree. He didn't say it, but I could see from his expression that he suspected I had had some romantic encounter and was being pursued by a jealous husband. In the Parisian environment, who wouldn't guess that? I didn't have time to explain to him. I just asked him to go to my hotel immediately and retrieve the small suitcase I had packed. As for the other luggage, I asked him to pick it up and store it for me in a few days. Fortunately, he introduced me to the hotel, so the landlord wouldn't make things difficult for him.

### Supervisors of Major Companies on Nanjing Road Thoroughly Researching Commodity Pricing; Said Current Pricing Will Not Be Further Reduced

According to a previous report from the Domei News Agency, the prices of all daily necessities in major companies in the International Settlement will be significantly reduced in the near future. The report stated that the authorities are planning to have prices of various goods officially regulated.

This new method will be implemented in Wing On, Sincere, The Sun, New Wing On, and Whiteaway, Laidlaw & Co.

Admitting Prices Higher Than Elsewhere

However, according to the English *Shanghai Times*, senior executives of major companies on Nanjing Road solemnly stated yesterday that the prices of daily necessities currently displayed in various companies have already been determined by the supervisors of the Asia Development Board. Therefore, they will not be ordered to lower prices again. These executives admitted that prices in the companies are slightly higher than in other areas, such as Avenue Joffre, but they argued that the superior quality of the goods is more beneficial to customers than lower prices. According to them, all major companies and stores in the city are currently being monitored by personnel dispatched by the Asia Development Board. These monitors communicate directly with the Asia Development Board, and only one of them has the authority to revise prices. As for why the major companies do not join the Retailers Association, one executive said that it was based on the opinion of their monitor, who said that joining the association was not currently necessary.

Exceeding Price Limits to Prevent Losses

When the currency system changed in June of this year, the prices of all goods in the Wing On Company were converted from old legal tender to Central Reserve Bank notes at a ratio of one hundred yuan to sixty-six yuan. According to the executive, this ratio seemed quite fair at the time. However, after a few days, they quickly realized that the company was experiencing huge losses, so they revised the ratio again. The public misunderstood the actions of the major companies, thinking that there would be another change, but in fact, prices always depended on quality.

No Losses for Small Stores with Price Limits

He continued that the authorities ordered general small stores to reduce prices to 50% of the prices set before May 26th, because these stores had increased prices almost daily in May. An item that was worth 100 yuan in legal tender on May 1st may have been raised to 150 yuan by May 26th. Therefore, the authorities' announcement did not result in losses for these stores. According to another executive, the situation at the major companies at the end of June was different from the above. Because the major companies dared not increase prices daily due to reputation and other factors, the prices of all items in that month did not change in any way. Therefore, accepting a currency conversion ratio of two to one would have resulted in huge losses.

Supervisors Researching Pricing

The executive also said that the supervisors assigned by the Asia Development Board have now begun to thoroughly research the prices of all goods in individual companies. After a long period of discussion, prices have been determined, and the standard is based entirely on the opinions of customers and supervisors, striving for appropriateness.

### Closing Time for Theaters Postponed Starting Tomorrow; Closing Time for Movie Theaters Still to Be Negotiated

After the Public Works Department announced on the 22nd that amusement parks were allowed to extend closing times under certain conditions, a reporter from the Datong News Agency learned that dance halls had already extended their closing times to midnight the night before, as had nightclubs. Peking opera theaters have also agreed to change their opening time to 7:00 PM (currently 6:30 PM) and extend the closing time to 11:30 PM (currently 10:30 PM) starting on the evening of the 25th. The same will be done for Chinese opera theaters in various amusement parks. Therefore, the closing time for all amusement parks will inevitably be extended to 11:30 PM. As for movie theaters, the Film Association will hold a meeting soon to discuss it. According to a movie theater representative, extending the closing time is inevitable, but the implementation date will probably be within a few days after the 25th and will not be delayed until next month.

### Discrepancies in Passport Photo Prices

Yesterday, the Photographic Industry Association responded to a query from Huichang regarding "Why are residence permit photos in Nanshi sold at a discounted price of two and a half yuan for six photos, while the size is two inches?" They specifically stated the reason as follows: The Photographic Industry Association, in order to comply with the intention of the authorities of the two settlements to reduce the burden on citizens, has approved limited prices for taking citizen ID photos, which members must follow uniformly and cannot raise or lower. The deadline for taking citizen ID photos in the International Settlement has ended, while the French Concession is still in progress. ID photos are sold for three yuan for six photos in Central Reserve Bank notes. Passport photos in the International Settlement should be higher in price due to costs and reasonable profit, but in order to reduce the burden on citizens, they are also sold for three yuan for six photos, with an additional donation of one jiao to the Public Works Department. As for the residence permit photos recently taken in Nanshi, because the prosperity of the district has not recovered to its former state and because the Japanese Chiyo Yangxing provided some of the film at a discounted price, the police approved a reduction of half a yuan compared to the settlements. However, the size is two inches, as stipulated by the Municipal Police Bureau according to the Ministry's order. In fact, the size of the photo frame on the residence permit is the same as the half-inch photo of the photographic industry, the same as in the two settlements, and is not the two-inch photo referred to by the photographic industry. Therefore, whether in the International Settlement, the French Concession, or the southwestern district of Shanghai, if customers take two-inch photos, they will still be priced according to the grades set by the members of A, B, C, and D, each according to their respective grades.

### Death of American Resident Payne

American H.F. Payne, who resided in both Peking and Shanghai for a long time and was well-known to many, recently died of heart disease after suffering for several weeks. Payne passed away on August 22nd of this year at the Grosvenor Apartments in the French Concession. Payne was born in Troy, New York, USA, on December 28, 1875. He joined the American Bank Note Company early in his career. In 1918, he represented the company in the Far East, establishing an office in Peking. In 1926, he was promoted to vice president of the company and Far East manager, with Peking as the head office. On February 8, 1927, he took leave and returned to the United States. He married Selma Nelson in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the couple returned to Peking. In 1928, he came to Shanghai on company business and then resided in Shanghai for a long time. In 1939, he resigned from his position at the company, but continued to live in Shanghai, residing at the Grosvenor Apartments and having connections with the Hwa Loh Bank and other companies. He was well-known to people in both Peking and Shanghai and was a prominent member of the American community. Even foreigners in Shanghai were aware of him. His business dealings involved many Chinese and foreign people, and his residences in Peking and Shanghai were social centers. In recent years, Payne devoted himself to various committees of the French Association in addition to his other affairs. His death was mourned by all who knew him. Only his wife remained in Shanghai, while the rest of his family was in New York. In accordance with his wishes, funeral arrangements were kept simple.

### Competition for Stall Site: One Stabbed to Death: Injury to Vital Part Untreatable

Shen Baiju, 26 years old, from Ningbo, lived at No. 5 Kangti Road in the French Concession. He made a living selling duck at a stall in front of Lane 356 of Ningxing Street. Yesterday morning around 7:00 AM, he got into an argument with another duck stall vendor over competing for a stall site. The argument escalated into a physical fight, and the other vendor took out a sharp blade and stabbed Shen violently in the chest. Shen collapsed to the ground, bleeding profusely. The assailant fled the scene after realizing what he had done. Shen was rushed to Renji Hospital for treatment, but he died before arriving due to the severity of the injury.

### Mrs. Yao Funeral Ceremony Aided Education; No Further Condolences Accepted

The Yao family has always emphasized education, especially primary school, as the foundation for cultivating talent. Therefore, they pay particular attention to children who are unable to attend school. This time, the funeral expenses of the late Mrs. Yao, in accordance with her will, will be used to save all unnecessary expenses. In addition to publishing an obituary in the newspapers, they dare not disturb relatives and friends, nor will they accept condolences separately. All gifts from relatives and friends are requested to be sent directly to Shen Bao and Xin Bao to be used as a loan fund for primary schools. It is reported that the Yao family also intends to include the funds for the reception and labor costs into the Yao Family Primary School Loan Fund, in order to fulfill the will and comply with her original intention.

Donation for Education

Yesterday, the newspaper reported that the total amount of the scholarship fund was overstated by 20 yuan (the total of the Changyin Cup ball tickets and Mrs. Yao's funeral donations was 4,160 yuan and 5 jiao, which was mistakenly printed as 4,180 yuan and 5 jiao). Therefore, the total amount of the balance was also overstated by 20 yuan. This is a correction. The following is a list of titles of those who sent donations for Mrs. Yao's funeral yesterday: Xu Bo Xiong 400 yuan, Shen Lai Qing 200 yuan, Sun Yongzhen and brothers 40 yuan, Shen Mei Chu 20 yuan, Xu Sheng San 20 yuan, Chen Jian Xia 20 yuan, Li Hui Ru 20 yuan, Li Zu Ling 20 yuan, Mrs. Pu Qi Ting and family 10 yuan. The total amount is 750 yuan in savings certificates. The balance yesterday was 185,968 yuan, 7 jiao and 2 fen. The total balance is 186,718 yuan, 7 jiao and 2 fen.

### French Concession Permits Two People on Bicycles; Public Concession Not Yet Implementing

To ensure traffic safety within the concessions and avoid vehicle accidents, both concessions previously had explicit regulations prohibiting two people from riding on bicycles. As a result, citizens who violated the rules were often detained by police officers and fined. However, the police authorities of the French Concession, considering that the source of gasoline in the city has been cut off since the outbreak of the war, and the number of cars driving has become increasingly rare, making traffic safety less of a concern, have decided to change the previous regulations prohibiting two people from riding on bicycles. The police authorities posted a notice stating that from now on, if the above situation is found, it is not necessary to take them to the police station, but only if they do not violate traffic rules. As for the Public Concession, it still adheres to the established rules and does not allow two people to ride on bicycles; otherwise, a fine will be imposed.

### Tongren Cup Table Tennis Tournament Scheduled to Open September 1st

Recently, Mr. Wang Yijing and others initiated the Tongren Cup Charity Championship to raise funds for the Tongren Hospital's free clinic and medicine distribution, and invited Mr. Chen Linsheng to preside over everything. A total of 18 teams have joined the competition, which is scheduled to open on September 1st. Among the participating teams, the San Yi and Postal teams are the strongest. In addition to the veterans Zhang, Yongchang Wang Jingyuan and Han Dewei, San Yi also has the chopping master Zhang Ying and the pumping master Chuan Qifang to work for them, and the hope for the overall championship is the strongest. However, the strong enemy is the Postal team, which is organized by colleagues from the Post Office. Famous players such as Wang Huizhang, Jiang Chunshan, and Ye Xiuzhang are all skilled. In the future, when the two heroes meet, it is not known who will win. Others such as Yang Changxi, Zhang Fuwei, and Huang Min of Qinglian, Chen Zhensui and Su Wenbin of Hongzhang, Ye Ziqing of North America, Zhu Qingji and Yang Peitang of Youxing, Dong Shaotang of Huabu, Shen Hua and Zheng Zhifang of Xijing, Shi Jiaxian of Lianqing, and Wu Zuochang of Shenlong are all rising stars. Veterans such as Chen Yi, Lin Jin, Zhang Shanlin, Chen Baifu, Yu Chunrong, and Liu Chuanxin have also joined various teams to serve, and their spirit is commendable. The biggest gain this time is the participation of the Guangming Women's Team in the competition. Since the dissolution of the Women's Qingnianhui Table Tennis Team two years ago, women's table tennis has lost all its vitality. This time, Guangming has emerged as a dark horse. The team also has the captain Yi Qibu, Cai Xiuyu, and two famous players from Hualian, Lin Yijin and Lan, joining. The competition committee resolved yesterday to hire a number of honorary members and consultants to facilitate the progress. The list is as follows: (Honorary Members) Wang Tongyuan, Wang Jingyuan, Zhou Yukang, Zhou Juchen, Liang Jintang, Du Zhenyu, Du Limin, Wei Zhiwei, Zhu Lianxiang, Hong Hanbin, Chen Tianjue, (Consultants) Xu Duo, Yu Binqi, Zhou Daoqian, Wang Yi, Lu Zhongqiu, Hu Jiankun, Liu Keren.

Next, Fang Jiaobo presided over the auction, and as a result, Mr. Gui Xiangqing, the manager of the Jiangnan Jellyfish Company, purchased it for 3,000 yuan.

### Air Defense Propaganda Has a Profound Impact: A Review of the Rise and Fall of Real Estate

— Wang Dao

The real estate market in this city before the January 28th Incident can be called the golden age. At that time, land prices rose frequently, transactions flourished, and everyone regarded it as the safest investment target. The January 28th Incident shook the security of real estate in the past, and the national economic panic attacked it afterward, so land prices plummeted. It was not until the implementation of the legal tender system that it stabilized. But before long, the August 13th Incident occurred, and the situation changed again. Everyone thought that the phenomenon of land price collapse during the January 28th Incident would repeat itself? Land prices also plummeted for a time. Who knew that the war moved west, and the population gathered more and more in Shanghai? As a result, rents soared, and new construction businesses sprung up, and real estate prices also increased. In addition, foreign exchange shrank frequently, and various industries were abnormally prosperous, so there were many active floating funds. Until the British, American and Dutch assets in China were frozen last autumn, the market changed, and real estate transactions were greatly suppressed. With the occurrence of the New January 28th Incident, the degree of decline became even worse. According to our investigation and estimation, the changes in the transaction value of real estate in this city in recent years are as shown in the following table (unit: legal currency yuan): 1930 84,446,000 1931 183,217,000 1932 25,175,000 1933 43,136,000 1934 12,990,000 1935 14,460,000 1936 14,201,000 1937 6,270,000 1938 14,070,000 1939 55,644,000

1940 101,227,000 1941 83,996,000

Recently, due to currency fluctuations, people's hearts are shaken, and real estate is again regarded as a target of wealth, and prices have soared and transactions are also booming. This is not only true in the concession area, but also extremely lively in the urban area. According to our investigation and estimation, the turnover in May and June was no less than 18 million yuan: the transaction in the last month was also not weak. However, since the beginning of air defense propaganda, on the one hand, there have been measures to prohibit the transfer of British and American title deeds, and at the same time, there has been talk of levying real estate donations. The emerging real estate market is now gradually becoming silent again. Although real estate transactions have turned silent, the demand for houses south of Suzhou Creek has suddenly become strong again. Independent houses with better construction, regardless of size, are not easy to get. Is it caused by the population movement that came with the air defense propaganda? However, since the implementation of the Baojia system, the movement of Chinese households has been greatly reduced; therefore, the housing panic seen recently may be caused by other reasons.

### Market Trends

The interbank lending rate of money shops continues to decline. It can be seen that the money supply is loose, and the situation of the money shop industry is becoming more and more difficult. Recently, there have been announcements of regulatory measures to limit the business of money shops to the four areas of deposits, loans, bill discounts, remittances, and documentary bills. This is quite different from the mortgage loan measures recently announced by the Money Shops Association, so for a time everyone felt at a loss. Reflected in the securities and commodity markets, it also presents a ______ phenomenon.

Government Bonds

The estimated market is weak, and the plan to establish a securities industry association has not been approved, which is the main reason. However, it is said that the stock industry association, which has been approved for establishment, intends to also operate government bonds. If so, the future is still promising.

National debt is the debt owed by the state and has nothing to do with changes in dynasties, so the authorities have never denied the old debt. There is a good reason for this. If the old debt is denied, not only will the financial credibility of the country be damaged, but also the survival of the financial community will be greatly affected. I know that the problem is not here, but there may be other reasons.

Chinese Stocks

The Silver Association's provision that the valuation of Chinese stocks should not exceed the face value of the interbank lending method is unfavorable to the future of Chinese stocks. After this journal raised it in the last issue, it has now become a topic in public opinion circles, and it is generally believed that the measure is inappropriate and should be corrected. The commercial news column of this newspaper the other day had a special article by Mr. Dun Tie discussing this matter. How this issue is resolved is deeply and greatly related to the future of Chinese stocks, and the current soft feet of Chinese stocks are indeed greatly affected by this method.

The trend of Chinese stocks last week was weak and vulnerable. Financial stocks were relatively stable, department store stocks were unanimously bearish, textile stocks fell the most sharply, new pharmaceutical stocks struggled to get through, cultural stocks collapsed, and tobacco stocks were also in a bad situation. Other stocks also fell. Although there was good news about the establishment of the stock industry association, people's hearts were still dim and lifeless. Looking forward to this week, due to the announcement of the so-called Interim Measures for the Administration of Financial Institutions, which allows financial institutions to sell real securities, it may have some exciting effect on the market atmosphere. But the desire for the universal revitalization of people's hearts still needs to be awaited.

Yarn and Cloth

The trend of yarn and cloth is still strong; however, the supply of Japanese yarn is not declining, and the market price is forecast to fall between 5,100 and 5,200 yuan, which is weaker than the previous week, putting some pressure on Chinese yarn. Therefore, by the weekend, Shuangma also saw a small recovery, and the price was back to the 5,000 yuan level. The difference between the peak of 5,500 yuan in the middle of the week cannot be said to be small. The rise and fall of various stall factory cloths were mixed. For example, coarse cloth rose by 7-8 yuan compared with last week, while fine cloth fell by 3-4 yuan or even 5-6 yuan.

### Off-Site Anecdotes

It is difficult to obtain both raw materials and the market, so floating funds have to go to the realm of surplus financing. As a result, banks, money shops, trusts, insurance companies, and even stock companies and real estate companies are opening one after another. However, the business scope of money shops has recently been limited to simple deposit and loan businesses. The sharp drop in interbank lending rates in the past few days shows that the future of money shops is not bright. The use of funds in the insurance industry, like others, is quite problematic. And the use of its reserve funds may also be restricted. Real estate has been greatly affected by air defense propaganda and has been severely hit. This threat also has an effect on stocks. And the saying of "eye management" is rampant. The way out for floating funds may be temporarily in a state of wait-and-see.

The financial, industrial and commercial industries have recently been implementing capital increase plans. The largest increase is as much as 6 million yuan, and the lowest is 180,000 yuan; and 500,000 to 1.5 million yuan is the most common.

In the financial industry, the recent capital increases include seven new banks: Datong, Huamao, Yongfeng, Limin, Fu, Shanghai Industrial, and Dalai. Most of them have been open for less than half a year. The money shops that have increased capital are Dunyu and Jinyuan, and the trust companies are Tongyi and Hexiang.

The general industrial and commercial enterprises that have implemented capital increases include China Underwear, Dazhonghua Weaving, Zhongnan Weiying, Yong'an Textile, Xinfeng Weaving, Hongshen Weaving, Yongxiang Printing, Kaili Silk, World Book Company, China Watch, Daxin Chemical, Ning Shao Commercial Steamer, Yuhua Chemical, Gongxin Electric, Tiangong Industrial, Ningbo Dyeing and Weaving, and Jingu Hotel.

The motives for the capital increase can be divided into three categories: one is to plan to expand business, but not many. The second is to prepare for registration, because those whose capital amount does not meet the registration standard will be banned. Most of the capital increases in the money shop industry are for this purpose. The third is to reduce the tax burden. Capital increases by general industrial and commercial enterprises mostly have this effect.

The saying of strengthening the price control in this city has recently become rampant again. Summarizing the views of Dongbao, it seems that the Public Works Department will set up a price control department, and Fukuaki of the Mitsui Group will be appointed as the director. At the same time, a unified organization will be established above the Chinese Chamber of Commerce to coordinate the work of the price control department to implement control work. In terms of control technology, it seems that management and rationing are the focus, and retail prices are the goal. As a result, citizens' consumption lives will not only use rationing coupons for food, but also use various winter-like rationing coupons for other daily necessities.

In order to promote the heavy industry in North China, the Japanese domestic surplus industrial production equipment has been decided to move to North China. It is heard that the promotion of this plan is handled by Japan's Industrial Equipment Corps.

The Japan Xingya Institute's Central China Liaison Department is currently considering merging the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Shanghai with the Chinese Chamber of Commerce of Shanghai to form the Japan-China Chamber of Commerce and Industry in order to complete the plan for the reorganization of Shanghai's economy and to promote material management and price control. This matter has attracted great attention from both Chinese and Japanese business and industry circles.

### Root Out Evil Completely

— Xia Min

In Matthew 5:29-30 in the New Testament, Jesus taught his audience, "If your right eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. And if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell." Of course, Jesus spoke these words from a spiritual and spiritual perspective.

But from a medical point of view, these words are also reasonable. It is common practice to amputate a part of the limb to prevent the entire limb from being poisoned. This is also a kind of "better to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell."

Ordinary people always think that people who have their legs and arms cut off have shorter lifespans. However, there has recently been a new discovery in this regard. Dr. Qiu Fu of Hamburg, France, studied the results of 60,000 amputees in history and found that their vitality was particularly strong, their lifespan was particularly long, and their mortality rate was only 3.68%, while the mortality rate of ordinary civilians with sound limbs was as high as 5.98%. It can be seen that people who "lose one part of their body" can not only "prevent their whole body from going to hell," but also prolong their lives.

Therefore, we should be selfless and root out evil completely!

### Sister Schools

— Little Pan Shuxian

(3) Foreign Women

Missionary schools are all established and managed by foreign missions. The funding is raised by them, and the personnel are also sent by them. Therefore, there must be some "foreign women" in missionary girls' schools. In the past, the principals of missionary schools were always foreigners, but in recent years, they have been gradually replaced by Chinese people. The most common positions held by foreigners in schools are English teachers and religious teachers. Some also serve as vice principals, school doctors, and teachers of other subjects. <Wouldn't their willingness to leave their homeland, cross the ocean, and come to this mysterious and perhaps dangerous ancient country be due to a kind of religious zeal? So, we don't need to go into detail about this point. What we want to talk about now is the various attitudes they take after coming to China.>

Some female missionaries truly have a spirit of sacrifice. They do not accept the salaries the school gives them, but rely solely on the allowances given to them by foreign missions to live on. Their lives are extremely simple. Some even eat the same food as the Chinese people every day. In the severe cold season, they only wear a thick silk-padded robe and a pair of large cotton shoes, and do not enjoy the light and warmth of the woolen fabrics produced in their homeland. They try their best to save money to help poor students or impoverished families in the church. Some have been in China for twenty or thirty years, and often prefer to die in China, sleeping underground with the descendants of the Yellow Emperor, rather than returning to their homeland.

But there are also those who regard the Chinese as a barbaric race, whose arrival in China is something that these pitiful souls should be forever grateful for. After living in China for some time, although they see that Chinese people do not eat rats as food and white wind as snacks, and that not every man marries concubines and not every woman inherits bound feet, they still cannot get rid of the idea that the Chinese are a barbaric and unsanitary race. Therefore, their words and actions often insult the Chinese. A certain school once had a Western female teacher who, because a careless student forgot to close the door behind them when entering the classroom in winter, causing the cold wind to blow on her delicate body, punished all the female students in the classroom who had already taken off their coats to go to the freezing corridor again, and then walk in one by one, each practicing closing the door behind them once, believing that this was the only way to cultivate their good habit of closing the door behind them.

Still others are too soft-hearted, putting religion before education. Surrounded by a group of people who rely on the church for food, they not only use the money that could have been used to help promising poor students to help stupid and undeserving students, but also, as long as a teacher can show twelve points of enthusiasm for religion, no matter how poor their knowledge or how unskilled their teaching methods, they always let them stay in the school. She thinks that keeping his job and preventing him from freezing and starving is a good thing, but she does not know that in doing so, she has delayed the studies of many young people.

Soon, many of them will be returning to their home countries. Regardless of whether they love or despise the Chinese, I imagine they will all feel reluctant to leave. (The End)

### Employment Agency

— Shi Dong

The high price of rice makes it impossible for ordinary middle-class families in Shanghai to continue to hire maids. But on the other hand, it is also impossible for spoiled wives to handle all the tasks of buying groceries, cooking, sweeping, and mopping the floor. As a result, a serious servant problem has arisen, which seems impossible to solve satisfactorily under the current circumstances.

Here, the so-called "Employment Agency" in New York is worth introducing. It can be said that it has completely solved the servant problem for middle-class families, and the increasing development of this company's business is sufficient to indicate the great success it has achieved with this new business.

Helpless housewives only need to dial a phone number, and within a few minutes, a capable chef, maid, or butler will be standing in front of them. Their work is paid for on an hourly basis. The price is uniform, depending on the amount of work done.

Maids can be hired long-term or short-term, depending on the family's needs. One of the features of this company is that it can send a maid every morning to work for one hour to tidy up and clean one room. Single men living in apartments are its regular customers. They only need to pay a small additional fee, and the company can take care of the management of their household affairs.

Banquets are one of the main business items of this new type of family service agency, because any host who wants to make a good impression on their guests will often hire first-class chefs and stewards to ensure that the guests and hosts have a good time. As for the preparation of meals, it can also be entrusted to the employment agency, because it has a special department to manage this matter.

Every employee of the employment agency has been carefully selected, so none of them are not quick-witted and capable. The reason why this company can gather so many excellent servants is entirely because they can work under extremely favorable conditions. The working hours are fixed, and they are not as long as those of ordinary servants, and they also have two weeks of paid vacation each year.

All employees are managed by trained butlers, so as to ensure that their work satisfies the housewives.

The founder of the employment agency is a woman who herself was troubled by the servant problem. The founding of this company not only solved her personal problem, but also solved the troubles of most housewives.

If there were such a company in Shanghai, it would surely reduce a lot of trouble for housewives.

### Symphony in the Forest

— He Mu

After the rain, in the middle of the night. A silver, hazy, smoky mist floats in the forest, the water vapor dyed with the light of the full moon; patches of small ponds shine on the ground, like the bright eyes of little goblins, the moonlight scattered on the accumulated rain in the small puddles.

I sit in a dark corner next to a camphor tree, gazing at the beautiful posture of the graceful branches and verdant leaves dancing in the mist; I am in contemplation, I am a little sad, I want to complain. ...

"Look, behind you, there is a treasure hidden in the sparkling light; to the left or right, there is a miracle rippling;" a voice rings out.

"No, I don't want treasures and miracles, I just want to drift forward;" so, I poured my proud voice into the silent coldness.

"Just to find that little flower, child?"

"Yes, just for that small, light blue flower of heavenly fragrance."

"That's right, let's go together, the cold night will hurt you."

"No, I have to go forward for that little flower."

"But maybe you will exhaust the spring of your life and still be far away from that little flower" Far away, but I have already embarked on a journey with a hopeful heart, I am already a wise man who understands the joy of life, my mind is full of beautiful memories, I can already pull the soft hair of children and tell them some of the secrets of life, because I am always moving forward. When the gods call me, I must have already obtained that little flower. …"

"Then, stubborn child, go forward, immediately, I wish you not to be swallowed by the waves of sorrow."

A breeze arose in the forest, the silver mist flickered, the branches and leaves began to dance...

I breathed a long sigh, exhaling all the disappointment and resentment in my heart, and walked towards the clear, cold silver mist, alone but with the heart of a youth.

### Sharing the Boat in Storms

(8) What Can Be Done

Wei Cheng spat out a few mouthfuls of clear water, and said in the faint morning light: "Aunt, is there anything wrong with my body?" Madam Ye Er asked someone to help Wei Cheng lie down in a rattan chair, and sat beside him, stroking Wei Cheng's chest, and replied: "Child, there is nothing wrong, just some marks of rope binding on your arms, they will naturally get better after a while." Wei Cheng said: "My feet were also tied by them." Madam Ye Er said: "It doesn't matter about the feet, you wore a thin cotton trousers, the binding is on the trousers legs. Don't be afraid in your heart, the things outside the body were robbed by the robbers, they will come back eventually, the peace of the population is the most important thing." At this time, A Xing, Xu Ge Fu, He Ma, etc. all spoke up, some said that they only knew it was a robbery when they woke up. Some said that they did not know how many robbers there were in total, but judging from the sound, there were at least ten or more. Wei Cheng waved his hand, telling them not to make a fuss. Madam Ye Er followed suit. Wei Cheng asked: "Is anyone injured?" Madam Ye Er said: "No." Wei Cheng glanced at the people standing in front of him, the sky was bright, and the morning light shone into the house. Wei Cheng said: "Where is Sister Cui Zhen?" At this question, everyone turned their heads to look around the house. A Xing scratched his temples and said: "Huh! Not long ago, I still heard Miss Cui Zhen speaking. We rushed to this room and that room, could it be that Miss Cui Zhen did not look for the young master!" Madam Ye Er said: "I already understand, the robbers' purpose is only money, they robbed things, would they still harm people? Xique, go to the back and shout, say the robbers are gone. I guess she is just like He Ma and Xique, the robbers were shouting outside the room, whoever moved, they would chop off your head with their swords."

Xique went to the back to Cui Zhen's room, went quickly, and came back quickly, saying: "Miss Cui Zhen is not in the room. I called a few times, but no one answered." This was surprising, and Wei Cheng, who was lying down, immediately stood up. Madam Ye Er said: "You lie down, what are you busy with. At most, Cui Zhen is like you, tied up by the robbers, and thrown in a corner of the room. Don't be busy, let them look for her." Wei Cheng said: "There is nothing wrong with my body, I will help them look for her. Sister Cui Zhen seems very calm on the outside, but she is, after all, a weak woman, it won't do." (162)
