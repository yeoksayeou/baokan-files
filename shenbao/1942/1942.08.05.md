### Gandhi and Azad Arrive in Bombay; Indian Congress Party Holds Meeting; Discusses Launching Civil Disobedience Movement to Fight for Independence; Calcutta Factory Workers Ready to Act

Lisbon, 3rd (Domei News Agency) – Gandhi arrived in Bombay today, departing from Wardha, to attend the All-India Committee of the National Congress Party on the 7th.

Bombay, 4th (Havas News Agency) – Indian Liberal Party leader Sapru advocated holding a round table conference. Mahatma Gandhi recently expressed his willingness to participate.

Xiongcheng, 4th (Domei News Agency) – According to sources in New Delhi, Indian public sentiment continues to support the All-India National Congress Party. The party leader, Azad, arrived in Bombay today to participate in discussions by the party committee to definitively decide whether the party agrees with the "Quit India" resolution passed by the Standing Committee last month. When Azad arrived at the Bombay train station, he was greeted by a large crowd. The Congress Party Standing Committee began its meeting at 4 PM today.

Lisbon, 3rd (Domei News Agency) – The All-India Committee of the Indian National Congress Party is scheduled to convene in Bombay on the 7th. Gandhi's previously advocated demand that British political forces withdraw from India has garnered fervent support from the entire Indian populace. Current British-Indian relations are extremely delicate and difficult to fathom. According to a report from the United Press Calcutta correspondent, Bliss, regarding the fervent Indian demand for independence, the All-India Committee of the National Congress Party will convene in Bombay on the 7th, a day that will determine India's future destiny. Workers in various factories and the general populace of Calcutta are prepared to launch an independence movement as soon as they receive instructions. The formal participation of factory workers in the independence movement will inevitably have a profound impact on Indian arms production. Gandhi's proposal that British political forces withdraw from India has been recognized by the Executive Committee of the National Congress Party, which is the voice of the Indian masses and advocates non-violence. Today, the Indian independence movement is on the verge of a bloody tragedy. The general populace of the Indian industrial state of Bengal also sincerely supports Gandhi's proposals. If a large-scale anti-British movement occurs in that state, the blow to Britain will be very great.

Lisbon, 4th (Domei News Agency) – According to reports from Bombay, Indian public sentiment is already showing signs of tension. In Bombay and New Delhi, people are talking in the streets and alleys. White hats, the symbol of the Gandhi movement, are visible everywhere. A few people in Bombay even felt unable to restrain themselves and threw bricks at military vehicles last Sunday. The slogans issued by the National Congress leaders are spreading like wildfire. One of them is reportedly a general strike (Hartal) to launch a civil disobedience movement, and another is to regard all British people as enemies and continue to disobey even if arrested and imprisoned. Judging from the current situation, the resolution passed by the Standing Committee, demanding that Britain withdraw from India, will definitely be passed by the Congress.

Gandhi Firmly Demands Immediate Declaration of Independence

New Delhi, 3rd (Havas News Agency) – Mahatma Gandhi arrived in Bombay yesterday to prepare to attend the key meeting of the Executive Committee of the Congress Party. He recently published an article in the "Harijan" newspaper, refuting the emotional outrage stirred up in British and American circles after the Congress Party demanded the immediate declaration of Indian independence. He stated briefly that no threat is sufficient to stop the actions of the Indian Congress Party. Considering the hysterical reactions caused in London and Washington, it is not difficult for us to imagine what situation the Indian people will encounter once they abandon their demands. But in any case, the flames of revolution will never be extinguished. If someone asks, who will take over when the British army withdraws from India? I can answer that Congress Party Chairman Azad has already said that the Congress Party does not seek to expand its own power, but to consider the rights of all compatriots in the country. If our party can seize power, we will immediately demand that all other political parties in India participate in cooperation. The only important thing is that political power belongs to Indians and is not subject to any restrictions. Unity will be achieved later. Because India's political parties demand foreign aid, India will never be unified. If the words and deeds of the leaders of the Indian Congress Party cannot satisfy the Allied countries, then the Indian people's dissatisfaction with the various measures taken to prevent their independence should not be condemned by others. In short, the obstacles encountered by the Indian national movement will only increase the resistance of the Indian people. According to Gandhi's views, which coincide with those of Congress Party Executive Committee member Patel, Patel recently gave a speech in Bombay, stating that the Congress Party intends to provide a guarantee that once India gains freedom, the party will dissolve, and said that once India gains freedom, the historical mission of the Congress Party will be completed. We do not use violence for violence. It does not matter whether our country is ruled by the Muslim League, by the Mahasabha, or by other political parties. India's proposal to cooperate equally with Britain under the current difficult circumstances was originally a fair method, but it was unexpectedly rejected by Britain. The Congress Party was forced to decide that the British army must withdraw from India.

Muslim League Cooperating with the Congress Party

Swiss Capital, 3rd (Havas News Agency) – "The Basel News" London correspondent recently telegraphed that the Executive Committee of the Indian Congress Party is scheduled to meet in Bombay on the 7th of this month to discuss a resolution to launch a civil disobedience movement. London is deeply anxious about this. At the same time, the Indian Muslim League is also scheduled to close its meeting in Bombay on the 16th of this month. Key figures in the Indian political world are now in talks with Mahatma Gandhi to facilitate a meeting between Congress Party leader Gandhi and Muslim League Chairman Jinnah. It is widely hoped that the outcome of the Gandhi-Jinnah meeting will lead to a temporary agreement between Hindus and Muslims, with a limited period until the end of the war. As for Gandhi's wish that the British army withdraw from India immediately, it is difficult for the British to tolerate it. The British government sincerely hopes to cooperate with the leaders of the Congress Party, but at the same time, it must make it fully clear that Britain may have to take various emergency measures to ensure India's public security. Indian people in London generally believe that the Congress Party will adopt a tough stance and will be supported by the majority of the people. According to news from New Delhi, the Indian Governor-General's Office has notified various political parties that private armed forces are not allowed to be organized in India, saying that these forces may ostensibly be labeled as protecting national groups, but in reality, they are usurping the responsibility of the Governor-General's Office to maintain public security. This situation is difficult to tolerate. It must be known that the Indian administrative system should not be changed at this time. The right of individuals to self-defense and mutual assistance defense organizations should not be prohibited, but non-military groups should not receive military education, and non-active military personnel should not wear uniforms. This has always been the policy of the government and must be implemented.

### Japanese Troops in Eastern Zhejiang Occupy Songyang and Suichang

Eastern Zhejiang Japanese Troops Frontline, 4th (Domei Telegraph) – Since the elite Japanese troops crossed the Xianxia Ridge and Fengling Mountain Range to fight, their vanguard had completely occupied Songyang City on the upper reaches of the Ou River at 8:40 yesterday morning. The city is located 85 kilometers southeast of Jinhua. Another unit occupied Suichang on the evening of the 1st. News last night was that the Japanese troops had arrived between Wanshoushan and Songchang, 20 kilometers from Songyang. When the Japanese army launched a new offensive on July 29, they first captured Beijie Town and Xinlu Market on the 30th, and after capturing Yingban west of Wanshoushan, they launched a large-scale attack on Songyang. When the Japanese army attacked Songyang on August 2, they also captured Wuqing, two kilometers northwest of the area. At the same time, its main force captured Wushucun, four kilometers northeast of Songyang, and then attacked Songyang from both sides. It also sent troops to attack Suichang separately, which was captured on the evening of August 1.

### Former Iranian Prime Minister Ordered to Form Cabinet; Greatest Feature of New Cabinet is to Balance Soviet and British Influence

Iranian Capital, 3rd (Havas News Agency)

After the newly appointed Prime Minister Sa'id was ordered to form a cabinet, he continued to contact key political figures today to select cabinet members. Although the future new cabinet will have a pro-Axis color, Prime Minister Sa'id still wants to find a way to form a "balanced cabinet" and invite former cabinet ministers to participate. Former Speaker of the Parliament, Chai Mia, will also join the cabinet. The greatest feature of the new cabinet is to balance the power of Britain and the Soviet Union. At present, Sa'id is the most suitable candidate for prime minister, but his duties are extremely difficult. For example, he must seek to restore borders and maintain the security of various provinces, adjust food supplies and improve transportation, and obtain economic assistance from Britain and the Soviet Union in accordance with the Soviet-Iranian-British Treaty.

### Small Country of Luxembourg is Germanized

Berlin, 3rd (Havas News Agency) – The "Völkischer Beobachter" recently published an article titled "Two Years of Luxembourg's Paper Weaving," describing how Luxembourg has been completely assimilated into Germany economically and spiritually since the military uprising. It briefly stated that two years ago, French was extremely common in Luxembourg. Today, only German is heard in the streets. The state has about 300,000 residents, of whom more than 75,000 have joined the Nazi Party, more than 18,000 young people have joined the Hitler Youth, more than 12,000 women have joined the Nazi Party women's groups, and 60,000 workers have joined the Labor Front. Among the German-occupied areas, Luxembourg has the highest proportion of volunteers in terms of population. In this small area, no less than 1,500 volunteers have been sent to the Eastern Front and Egypt. It is said that Luxembourg was originally built by Germans, and geographically and culturally, it is part of the Frankonian region.

### German Forces Advance South in Three Routes, Penetrating Deep into the Caucasus Interior; Fierce Fighting Along the Coast of the Sea of Azov; Soviet Forces Launch Counterattack in the Don River Bend

Berlin, 4th (Domei News Agency) – The German official news agency reported today that Voroshilovsk (more than 100 miles from the railway from Stalingrad to Elista), a key city in the Caucasus, has been occupied by German troops.

Berlin, 4th (Haitong News Agency) – Officials here confirmed that German troops occupied the city of Voroshilovsk, the capital of the Kupen region, about 150 kilometers east of Krasnodar. This news shows that German troops have penetrated the interior of the Caucasus in 24 hours. At the same time, officials confirmed that several German battalions had reached the Kupen River.

Somewhere on the Soviet border, 3rd (Havas News Agency) – On the 407th day of the German-Soviet war, German forces advanced south in three routes. The first route departed from Khoskaya, the second route departed from Kushchevskaya, and the third route advanced along the Sea of Azov, with the city of Maikop as the meeting point. At the same time, the triangular area of Bataysk, Salsk, and Tikhoretsk, connected by railways, was also completely occupied by German troops advancing south. German troops are now threatening the two strongholds of Kropotkin and Krasnodar on the Red Army's defense line. German military officials are very optimistic about the prospects of the current war situation, and do not believe that General Timoshenko's troops of the Red Army can concentrate large forces behind the Kupen River. They also said that when the German army began its attack on the Caucasus, London announced that the British army would fight side by side with the Red Army there, but as of now, not a single British soldier or cannon has appeared on the Caucasus front. Presumably, the British are experiencing great pressure in Egypt, and cannot spare a single soldier or cannon to go to the Soviet front to help. In addition, the fighting in the Don River bend is the most intense northwest of Kalach. The Red Army claims to have launched a large-scale counterattack, but the German side firmly denies it.

Stockholm, 4th (Havas News Agency) – According to the latest news from the front, German forces in southern Soviet Russia crossed the Yeya River yesterday and have now reached about 30 miles north of the middle section of the Kuban River. Berlin does not believe that the Red Army has sufficient time and means to deploy a solid defense line along the Kuban River, but it is expected that fierce fighting will occur in that area. As for the fighting at the Tsimlyansk bridgehead, it has become more intense in the past 48 hours. The Red Army admits that the enemy has crossed to the south bank of the Don River, but suffered heavy losses. Red Army aircraft are preventing its main force from crossing the river. Regarding the fighting in the Don River bend, Cologne confirmed that the Red Army has dispatched new forces and tanks to help in the battle. A German spokesman said, "The Red Army's determination and possibility of attacking have not been shaken, and the number of tanks that the Red Army has transferred to fight near Kalach and Kletskaya is truly astonishing." According to a report from the Quisco radio station, the fighting in the area has been repeated and extremely chaotic. Positions have changed hands several times in one day. German troops are still 60 miles away from Stalingrad. A few days ago, German troops were only 45 miles away from the city, indicating that the Red Army's counterattack has progressed 15 miles.

Lisbon, 3rd (Domei News Agency) – German forces are attempting to control the Sea of Azov and are advancing from Rostov towards the west coast of the Caucasus region. After occupying the port of Azov, they continue to advance south and are currently fiercely attacking the naval port of Yeysk, 130 kilometers southwest of Rostov, engaging in fierce battles with the Soviet army and navy defending the port. The fortress guns of the port are firing in unison, fiercely resisting.

Berlin, 4th (Haitong News Agency) – German troops have advanced to the upper reaches of the Kuban River. The German offensive in the southern part of the Eastern Front has entered a new stage. At the same time, German troops are advancing towards the middle of the Kuban River. North of the Kuban River, there are still remnants of Soviet troops holding out. If General Timoshenko regards the Kuban River as the last defense line at the foot of the Caucasus, then German troops can encircle the Soviet troops after reaching the upper reaches of the Kuban River. Well-informed sources believe that the German army is advancing rapidly, and the Soviet army cannot calmly set up defenses, nor can it obtain huge amounts of aid and vehicles. The advantage of German tanks is becoming increasingly obvious. Moscow has mentioned that Cossack cavalry will help in the battle around the Kuban River, but the Polish campaign has proved that cavalry is not enough to stop the German armored units.

Soviet Union Fully Defends Oil Fields, Famous Cossack Soldiers Help in Battle

Somewhere on the border of the Ukrainian state, 3rd (Havas News Agency) – Yesterday, the vanguard of the German armored column seized two strongholds in the Kropotkin and Tiflis regions of the Kuban River. According to detailed news from the front, the German army crossed the Kuban River on August 2, continued to advance southeast along the west bank despite the Red Army's resolute resistance, and gained a stronghold west of the city of Kropotkin. The city is one of the Soviet Union's important railway centers and is now threatened on three sides. Last night, another German unit broke through the Red Army's defense line in the Tiflis region, gaining another foothold on the south bank of the Kuban River. The main goal of General Bock is to spy on the city of Krasnodar. German troops are attacking the Caucasus region from the north and encountering resolute resistance from the Red Army in the Kuban River for the first time. The Red Army Headquarters has set up the first line of defense in the area, intending to prevent German troops from directly approaching the oil fields of the Caucasus region. However, the defense line of the Kuban River is temporary in nature, and its main resistance force is still in the mountains between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. Because the Kuban River basin is a large plain, the motorized units under General Bock are most suitable for fighting in this area. In the past ten days, the motorized units have driven straight in, far away from the infantry. The occupied areas left behind are generally consolidated by the rearguard units.

Soviet Resistance Becomes Stronger, Don River Water Changes Color

The resistance of the Red Army in the Don River bend seems to have strengthened, preventing the German army from directly attacking Stalingrad. In the lower reaches of the Don River, Germany and its allies continue to advance. In the past 24 hours, fierce battles have occurred there. As for the coastal area of the Sea of Azov, the sides are still fighting. A German force on the southern route has reached near the Sea of Yeysk. The port is already under German artillery fire, but the Red Army Headquarters has transferred some of the warships of the Azov Sea Fleet to the port to fiercely bombard the German positions on land. However, the German army's continued advance along the coast of the Sea of Azov will cause difficulties for the Soviet fleet, because the port of Yeysk is the most important base for the Soviet fleet in the Sea of Azov. At that time, not only will it be bombarded by German artillery, but it will also be continuously bombed by the German air force from the Kerch Peninsula. Therefore, it is expected that the Soviet fleet will ignore all dangers and cross the Kerch Strait. Between the Don River and the Volga River, the German Army Headquarters is trying to restore the initiative and has mobilized a large number of troops to launch a large-scale counterattack. The purpose is to recapture the German strongholds between Klimanskaya and Novogrigorevskaya. In addition, the Red Army in the Voronezh region is also launching an offensive. Although it has been repeatedly attacked, there has been no significant change in the positions. According to official news from Berlin, German aircraft engaged in air battles with Soviet aircraft groups in the sky over various lines yesterday, and a total of 26 Soviet aircraft were shot down.

Moscow, 4th (Domei News Agency) – "Pravda" published a report on the Don River battle situation on the 3rd, saying that German troops continued to launch fierce battles in the area of ​​Melitopol and were trying to build bridges at the Don River crossing point. After days of fierce fighting, the water of the Don River changed color. At the same time, there were more large-scale air battles in the sky.

The Strength of the Soviet Fleet is Considerable, its Future Fate is Worth Noting

Stockholm, 4th (Havas News Agency) – As the German-Soviet war has now advanced to between the Don River and the Caucasus, what will be the fate of the Soviet Black Sea Fleet? This is of great concern. Although this fleet has suffered losses, its strength is still considerable. At the beginning of the German-Soviet war, this fleet had one battleship, three heavy cruisers, 19 destroyers, about 40 submarines, and several torpedo boats and auxiliary ships. According to German estimates, this fleet currently has one battleship, five cruisers, 18 destroyers of various sizes, 38 submarines, and several torpedo boats and gunboats. This fleet can still play a major role in future battles, but the main problem is the lack of ports. Although the ports of Novorossiysk, Tuapse, Poti, and Batumi are still in the hands of the Red Army, their facilities are far inferior to those of Nikolaev and Sevastopol. Therefore, the German side believes that one day, this fleet will either sink itself, surrender, or escape into a neutral country and be banned.

### New York Governor Admits War Situation is Serious; The Next Three Months are a Critical Period; Opening a Second Front is Imperative

New York, 4th (Havas News Agency) – New York Governor Lehman recently declared that, up to now, we have been defeated. This is undeniable. The next ninety days will be one of the most important periods in world history. What Germany achieves in these three months will have a great impact on the final outcome of the war. And what the United States does in the next three months will determine the importance of Germany's various achievements. If Germany can complete its various goals this fall, the United States will encounter a serious situation. But opening a second battlefield is imperative, and it is hoped that the people of the country will work together to avoid defeat.

Dublin, 4th (Havas News Agency) – British public opinion still believes in the possibility of opening a second battlefield, because if this matter is delayed and undecided, after Germany's victories, there will be concerns about turning back to the west.

Vichy Authorities Study Possible Impacts

Vichy, 3rd (Havas News Agency) – The issue of opening a second battlefield and the possible impact of this move on the French people are still topics of discussion in the political circles and newspapers. Newspapers have been giving prominent coverage to news from Britain and the United States about opening a second battlefield, as well as various statements from the British and American command headquarters that may support a rapid landing in Europe. The dangers of landing are also detailed in the newspapers. Observers here believe that Britain and the United States may carry out a small-scale landing in Europe to contain German forces and to show the Soviet Union that they have provided effective assistance. As for the impact of the second battlefield on the French people, it was discussed at the Cabinet meeting on the 1st of this month. Afterwards, an official communiqué was issued criticizing Britain's attempt to create chaos in France and to strain German-French relations. After publishing this communiqué, the newspapers published commentaries, strongly stating that the French people are loyal to the government and will not be swayed by the situation. Some newspapers also recalled that when British troops advanced into the port of Saint-Nazaire a month ago, it had already resulted in the bloodshed of the French people.

### Italian Prime Minister Mussolini Convenes Military Conference, Gives Instructions to Ensure Security of Occupied Territories, Believes Anglo-American Opening of Second Front Difficult to Realize

Rome, 3rd (Havas) - Prime Minister Mussolini delivered a speech today in Gorizia, northern Italy, to senior generals, stating briefly, "The Axis powers possess various means to ensure victory, so whether here or anywhere else in the world, there is little chance of a second front being opened." According to reports, Prime Minister Mussolini recently traveled to Dalmatia and Slovenia in Yugoslavia to inspect the troops stationed there, and convened a military conference in Gorizia.

Finally, Prime Minister Mussolini gave individual instructions to the generals and then returned here, receiving enthusiastic welcomes from the people along the way.

Turkish Grand National Assembly Holds Meeting, Prime Minister to Elucidate Policy

Istanbul, 3rd (Havas) - The summer recess of the Grand National Assembly has ended, and the first session was held yesterday. At the opening, a moment of silence was first observed in memory of the late Delediseidan, and then several commercial treaties signed between Turkey and Bulgaria, Switzerland, and other countries were passed. The new Prime Minister, Saraçoğlu, is scheduled to deliver a speech to the Assembly within the day, which is being given great importance by all sectors. However, it is expected to focus primarily on domestic issues, and it is likely that he will describe the government's economic policies to the parliament. The main objective is to expand individual freedoms and rights. If so, the domestic economy will restore some freedom, because since the automatic control of prices and various industries and markets, abuses of power have frequently arisen, leading to widespread calls for a relaxation of controls. In addition, Saraçoğlu is expected to reiterate the government's foreign policy, explaining Turkey's relationship with the belligerent nations. In short, according to various estimations, the new Prime Minister is likely to continue the established policies of the previous Prime Minister, without any significant changes.

Istanbul, 3rd (Havas) - President İsmet İnönü, who spent several days resting in Florya on the coast of the Sea of Marmara, returned to the capital last night.

### Mysterious Egypt (8)

If you happen to return from Egypt to France and meet a big financier, or some financial tycoon, banker, importer, or exporter, and you strike up a conversation, it will definitely unfold like the dialogue in the book "Tartuffe":

"Let's talk about Egyptian wheat first..."

"Then what about cotton?"

"As for Egyptian corn..."

"Then what about cotton?"

"As for Egyptian rice..."

"Then what about cotton?"

"As for Egyptian sugarcane..."

"Then what about cotton? Cotton, cotton, please talk about cotton, don't talk about anything else. Because in Egypt, only cotton is worth discussing; if cotton production is good, everything is good; if cotton production is bad, nothing is good. Egypt's finances, money, wealth, economy... Egypt's lifeline, all depend on its cotton, entirely reliant on cotton. All of Egypt's debts, allocations, administrative expenses, public works, preservation of historical sites, imported goods, are all paid for and supported by cotton."

Egyptian cotton has a long history. Weaving existed as early as the time of the Min Dynasty, but unfortunately, planting wasn't widespread, and there was no effort to improve it. When Mehemet Ali was in power, one of his French engineers, Jumel, lived in Cairo and casually planted some cotton in his garden. He found that the quality was excellent, so he requested Ali to plant it widely in northern Egypt. From then on, Egyptian cotton suddenly surged into the cotton markets of Europe and Africa, around 1820.

The production of Egyptian cotton is not large, only accounting for about 6% of the world's cotton output, but why is Egyptian cotton so famous? This is truly because the quality of Egyptian cotton is exceptionally good; cotton produced anywhere else in the world is far inferior to it. It is particularly strong and particularly long, so it is very suitable for weaving and is known as "first-class cotton." Cotton produced in the Americas is only "second-class cotton."

In Egypt, planting usually takes place in August, and harvesting can begin in early December of the following year. There are three common methods of planting and cultivation.

Most of Egypt's cotton is exported as raw material and then re-imported after being made into clothing in other countries. This situation is quite absurd and also very lamentable, similar to the situation with cotton and silk in our country. There are not many textile factories in Egypt; there are only some cotton pressing factories in Alexandria. In recent years, although Egyptian cotton mills and the Anglo-Egyptian Textile Company have been established, their scale is not large, and their production is not even sufficient to meet domestic demand.

Next to cotton, the most important crop is sugarcane, and the sugar industry is even more prosperous than the textile industry. Ancient Egypt also knew how to grow sugarcane, but by the 18th century, sugarcane cultivation had almost completely disappeared. When Mehemet Ali made every effort to revive Egypt's treasures, sugarcane planting was revived. Initially, the planting area was only in the northern region, but later, the Egyptian Sugar Manufacturing Company bought a lot of land in the north and leased it to farmers, restricting them to plant a certain amount of sugarcane. From then on, the north became the sugarcane production area, and sugar factories were also concentrated there.

During the First World War, Egyptian sugar seized the opportunity to take over the markets of Germany and Austria. Therefore, since 1918, Egyptian sugar has been sold throughout Europe and Africa, and even in the Near East of Asia, there are many customers.

In addition, in terms of agricultural products, there is corn, which is the main food for Egyptian farmers. Other products include rice and wheat, which can be harvested twice a year, but the yield is not large. In terms of fruits, watermelons, oranges, lemons, and dates are more well-known. The best produce mostly comes from Menoufia, so fruit vendors on Nanjing Road always loudly shout this place name.

Egyptian cigarettes are very famous; almost every European and American knows about Egyptian cigarettes. In various parts of the world, men and women, young and old, often leisurely sit in the living room with an Egyptian cigarette between their fingers, blowing out puffs of bluish-gray smoke rings, and suddenly exclaim, "This Egyptian tobacco is truly excellent!"—In fact, Egypt does not produce tobacco silk; Egypt simply manufactures tobacco imported from abroad. This kind of thing can also be considered one of the mysteries of Egypt.

### Argentina Leans Towards the Axis, US Newspapers Issue Warning

Bern, 4th (Havas) - According to a dispatch from the Swiss Telegraph Agency in New York, the Philadelphia Inquirer published an editorial today stating that Argentina is continuing to lean towards the Axis powers, and that President Castillo of that country is calling this a prudent policy. We must tell them plainly that the country is taking an imprudent course. The expulsion of Mr. Franqui is an extreme act of unfriendliness towards the United States. We have just signed six agreements with Brazil, granting preferential market access to that country, so that the people of Argentina may know that we are willing to grant this preferential treatment to cooperative neighbors, but we are also prepared to deal severely with uncooperative neighbors.

### Over 300 British and Other Nationals Departed Shanghai by Ship Last Night, Negotiations for the Second Batch of American Nationals Withdrawal Are in Progress

According to a DOMEI dispatch, 276 officials and nationals of Great Britain and other Allied countries (146 British, 11 Norwegian, 1 Belgian, 115 Indian, 3 Dutch) boarded the overseas Chinese ship "Ryuta Maru" on the afternoon of the 4th and set sail directly for Lourenço Marques in East Africa for exchange. Among the foreign nationals evacuated this time, there were 48 officials (23 British, 11 French, 5 Dutch, 6 Belgian, 4 Norwegian). The Indians were voluntarily evacuating and had gathered in Shanghai from various places outside of Shanghai to await evacuation by ship. It is expected that they will arrive in Lourenço Marques in late this month. It is also heard that approximately 850 British and other Allied nationals remaining in Shanghai have decided to evacuate on the second evacuation ship, "Kamikura Maru," which is scheduled to depart in mid-month.

Large Ship Boarded at the New Customs Wharf

The evacuation of British and other Allied nationals, which had been subject to several twists and turns, finally became a reality yesterday afternoon. Forty-nine British diplomatic and consular officials and 275 civilians, totaling 324 people, who had come to Shanghai from the Chinese interior to gather, departed from the Columbia Country Club on the Great Western Road in over a dozen green public buses prepared by the Japanese Consulate at around 10:30 in the afternoon. They arrived at the New Customs Wharf on the Bund at around 1:00 and lined up to disembark. At 1:30, they were transferred by ferryboat, "Jinling Maru," etc., to the "Ryuta Maru" docked at Qichang Wharf in Pudong. The ship then weighed anchor at 6:00 in the afternoon and set sail for Lourenço Marques in East Africa. It will stop in Saigon en route before heading directly to Africa.

Strict Security with the Dispatch of Military Police

The security around the New Customs Wharf yesterday was even tighter than during the previous evacuation of American nationals. In addition to the police authorities dispatching a large number of armed personnel and plainclothes detectives to maintain order and direct traffic on the Bund, the Japanese Military Police also mobilized dozens of senior officers to guard and patrol the area. Except for those with special passes and evacuees wearing yellow chrysanthemum-shaped badges on their chests, no one was allowed to enter the New Customs Wharf. Therefore, the general public who came to see them off could only stand across the road or in designated locations, and were not allowed to approach.

Over 900 People Evacuated on the Same Ship

The "Ryuta Maru" was requisitioned this time to transport Allied nationals evacuating from the Far East to Africa, a situation similar to that of the previous "Conte Verde." When the ship arrived here from Yokohama, it was already carrying 454 foreign nationals evacuating from Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, including 244 civilians and 210 officials. British Ambassador to Japan Sir Craigie and Yokohama Consul Walstin were also among them. After the ship picked up 2214 evacuees from inland China here, it sailed to Saigon, where it picked up 101 British, Dutch, Belgian, and Norwegian officials and civilians evacuating from Thailand. Therefore, the exact number of evacuees on board the "Ryuta Maru" was 937.

Expected to Arrive in London in Late September

Among those evacuated yesterday, there were over 110 Indians. After arriving in Africa to exchange Japanese nationals, they will be sent back to India separately. The remaining British nationals will return to their country directly from Africa by ship and are expected to arrive in London around the end of next month. As for the future development of the evacuation process, it is unlikely to deviate from the following three paths: 1. The "Kamikura Maru" is scheduled to arrive here from Yokohama on the 14th of this month to continue carrying over 500 British officials and civilians from this port to Africa. 2. According to reliable sources, in addition to the "Ryuta Maru" and "Kamikura Maru," another ship will sail from Yokohama via Shanghai to Africa to transport Allied officials and nationals evacuating from Japan, China, and Korea. 3. Negotiations for the second American evacuation are in progress and are expected to be realized this autumn.

### Japanese Warning

The Shanghai Times reported that reliable Japanese sources here have warned British nationals repatriated that after reaching Lourenço Marques, they must not spread false rumors about the treatment of Allied nationals in the occupied territories. It is claimed that if these rumors are spread, the Japanese authorities will consider their attitude towards enemy nationals in Shanghai and the occupied territories. Some American nationals who boarded the Asama Maru to evacuate expressed gratitude for the treatment they received from the Japanese authorities towards Allied nationals, but upon arriving in Lourenço Marques, they immediately spread false rumors, claiming that Allied nationals in China had been mistreated.

### Major Tide Expected in the Huangpu River

According to the forecast of the Zhaopu General Administration, the summer floods are coming to an end, and the autumn floods are about to begin. Therefore, the rise of the tide in the Huangpu River will reach its peak. In the event of wind and rain, the tidal waters on the Bund will inevitably flood the land.

### Interbank Check Guarantee Implemented Among Silver and Money Businesses, Guarantee Request Must Be Filled Out and Approved, Treated as Cash or Crossed Check

### Scorching Sun and Profuse Sweat - A Quick Sketch of the British Evacuation - The New Customs Wharf Becomes a Tropical Coast, and the Rhythm of People Resembles a Racial Exhibition

Yesterday afternoon, the sun in the sky radiated suffocating heat like a red-hot stove. The wind on the river was exceptionally muggy. Under such circumstances, although the new customs wharf resembled a tropical coast, the inner activity and emotional intermingling still propelled the rhythm of people. Under the shade of parasols, straw hats, and fans, people were still sweating profusely, looking around, and running back and forth as if they had lost something.

Just as the customs clock struck twelve, the side of the Huangpu Bund along the river was declared under martial law. A group of people who had come from every corner of this metropolis to see off their relatives or friends were blocked outside the rope and could not approach. Around one o'clock, more than ten specially prepared green buses set off in a mighty procession from Columbia Circle toward the Bund. As this long winding snake turned out of South Road and pointed toward the new customs, a great commotion continuously arose among the send-off crowd.

"Jack, look, they're here!" a Western woman said, pushing a man next to her.

"Yes, let's run over there. I think we can definitely see Jenny."

The area in front of and behind the new customs wharf could be said to have opened a racial exhibition. Among the evacuating expatriates, besides the majority being British, there were also over a hundred Indians. Wrapped heads, loose and curly beards, noses with silver rings, floral cloths draped over their bodies, and loud and rude voices added a lot of humor. When two Indians were talking and fooling around, a military police officer guarding the post couldn't help but smile.

When they got out of the cars one by one, lined up, and prepared to board the ferry to cross over to the Longtian Maru, the expressions on their faces were very difficult to describe. Some seemed shy and dared not raise their heads, some deliberately pretended to be self-possessed and nonchalant, some restrained their smiles and put on a serious face. The most amusing were the innocent children, calling out for their parents. They were like prisoners released from prison.

The ferry pulled up its whistle, and the shaky hearts calmed down a bit. Many people were still crowding around the wharf, waving their hands and calling out the names of those who had left. The smoke was hazy, and only the seabirds flying on the river could be seen. Whether it was sadness or joy, it was best left to everyone to guess for themselves! (Liang)

### Jiangsu Bank - Inspect Safe Deposit Boxes - Box Holders Must Open Them Jointly Before the End of This Month

If they fail to open their boxes by the deadline, the Japanese authorities will dispose of them as they see fit, and the bank will not be responsible for anything. According to a report by a Datong News Agency reporter, the above method has been posted by the bank to notify all safe deposit box renters to comply.

### Investigate Vegetable Market Prices in Various Districts of the Chinese Area - To Make Them Consistent

Currently, the prices of all goods in Nanshi, Zhabei, and Huxi have no fixed standard. In some cases, the prices of goods in the same vegetable market often differ greatly. According to experts, the creation of this phenomenon is not only due to the different sources of transported goods but mostly due to the fact that vendors want to seek huge profits. The Price Control Committee of the district is now sending personnel to various vegetable markets to conduct thorough investigations in order to have a standard so that the prices set by vendors are consistent.

### Fines for Rice Shops

The French Concession Police Department continued to inspect various rice shops and found that the following five had engaged in malpractice and irregularities on the spot and were fined as follows: Rice Shop No. 548 at 370-374 Fada Road, fined 3,000 yuan; Rice Shop No. 666 at 119 Balizhi Bridge Street, fined 200 yuan; Rice Shop No. 447 at 6 Wangzhi Road, fined 1,000 yuan; Rice Shop No. 578 at 275 Baili Road, fined 300 yuan; Rice Shop No. 616 at 242-244 Kaizi Er Road, fined 700 yuan.

### Five Major Department Stores - Coordinate to Adjust Commodity Prices

The Department Store Federation has automatically adjusted commodity prices, but it does not include the five major companies: Daxin, Yong'an, Xinxin, Sincere, and Lihua. However, the Federation has issued a notice, hoping that these companies will cooperate. It is reported that the five major companies are currently cooperating with the Xingya Yuan, and the five companies have been advised by the Xingya Yuan to record and supervise prices.

### Statistics from Accounting Family Income and Expenditure Show - Living Standards of Chinese Staff - Compiled by the Industrial and Social Affairs Department of the Public Works Department (1)

The living conditions of Chinese staff in Shanghai, at a time when prices are rising, everyone feels that "making a living is difficult," but accurate statistics are hard to come by. The Industrial and Social Affairs Department of the Public Works Department took on this arduous task and produced this statistical report on living standards. This is a noteworthy record, a realistic portrayal of the salaried class being driven by life today.

Family Livelihood Survey

The Industrial and Social Affairs Department of the Public Works Department of the Public Concession of this city compiles and discloses monthly both a cost-of-living index for Western staff and one for Chinese workers in order to show the extent to which rising prices affect their lives. However, there is no such index for Chinese staff. Their living conditions and living expenses are a matter of concern for both employers and employees. Therefore, at the repeated request of Chinese and Western employers, this department has compiled this statistics for reference.

At the beginning, this department planned to solicit 500 staff families to record detailed accounts of income and expenditure, as well as other items. The recording period was set at three months, from October 1, 1941, to December 31, 1941. A total of 1,038 families responded, of which 167 stopped recording as they went, 430 recorded accounts that were not suitable for use, and the remaining 441 recorded according to the prescribed method. On December 8 of last year, the Pacific War suddenly broke out, and the political and economic situation in this city changed rapidly. Prices soared, and employers were eager to publish this statistics as soon as possible. However, due to the heavy workload, it could not be completed overnight. In order to meet the needs, this department has first compiled statistics on the living conditions of 100 families based on their accounts and compiled a temporary index. The official index and research on living standards based on 441 families are still pending.

Family Selection Criteria

The criteria for selecting families were formulated based on preliminary trial surveys. All those who met the following conditions were eligible for selection: The accounting family must be from the Chinese staff class in this city. The head of the household is not limited to any industry, but farmers, workers, or those who set up their own businesses are not eligible for selection. Families who are self-reliant and do not rely on ancestral property income or parental subsidies for daily living expenses. The head of the household's salary and other income, regardless of the amount, is limited to an average of no more than 1,000 yuan in old legal tender per month. Those who are paid in foreign currency are not eligible for selection. The family size, including husband and wife, children, and dependents, should not exceed ten people. Lodgers who pay fees and servants are not included. The family residence is limited to those who live in rented houses. Those who own their own houses or lodge in service places without paying rent are not eligible for selection. The family meals are limited to self-catering or hiring servants to cook. Those who contract with cooks or canteen operators are not eligible for selection, except for those who eat out due to service or study.

Family Income Distribution

Responding families were originally limited to those with a monthly income of no more than 1,000 yuan. Subsequently, families with incomes exceeding 1,000 yuan expressed great interest in participating, so the limit had to be relaxed. According to income grouping, there were 19 families with less than 500 yuan in old legal tender, 64 families with 500 to 1,500 yuan, accounting for the majority, and 17 families with 1,500 yuan and above.

Family Organization

The average number of family members in a Chinese staff family is 6.6, lodgers 0.06, and servants 0.94, totaling 7.60. Converted into consumption units, family members are 4.72 units, lodgers 0.06 units, and servants 0.74 units, totaling 5.52 units. Worker families average only 5.04 people, totaling 4.43 units.

Among the 100 families, there are 660 family members. Men account for 48.18 percent and women 51.82 percent. Grouped by age, those under 14 years old account for 42.73 percent, those between 14 and under 60 account for 51.82 percent, and those 60 and above account for 5.45 percent. The average age of the husband is 36.89 years old, the wife 33.50 years old, the son 8.22 years old, and the daughter 9.37 years old. On average, each family has one husband, one wife, 3.45 children (1.82 sons and 1.63 daughters), and 1.15 dependents. The distribution of the number of children is relatively balanced, with 1.82 sons and 1.63 daughters. There are 6 lodgers and 94 female servants, averaging slightly less than one servant per family. Among the 100 families, there are 224 students, accounting for 33.94 percent of the family members. There are 108 employed men and 13 employed women, totaling 121 people, accounting for 18.33 percent. Only 6 wives are employed, 4 sons, and 3 daughters. The income of children does not supplement household expenses. Therefore, one employed person must support an average of 5.61 people, including servants. The distribution of occupations is shown in the following table:

### Tight Credit and High Interest Rates - Many Public Bonds Emerge - A Small Retracement Should Occur After Five Consecutive Days of Rises

The public bond market weakened yesterday due to tight credit and high interest rates, and many floating buyers came out to sell, causing the trend to turn weak. Normally, after rising for five consecutive days in this period, a small retracement should occur. The reason for the rise was only due to open trading and not being subject to control. A slight crowding of floating buyers would inevitably lead to uncertainty and selling. The market situation became small, and the buying power was not as strong as before. Therefore, it is expected that it would not be sustainable. Because the recent lowest price has risen by about five yuan, and Type C has reached the 40 yuan mark, it is not easy for those without strong financial strength to break through the barrier. Therefore, there is this retracement, and it is not easy to see a reversal in the short term. Yesterday, Tonglishun and Lianyi continued to buy, and Lida Chang, Hongxing, Tongyu, and others also absorbed some, but Xinhua Bank suddenly had a lot of selling, and Xinyuan, Hongda, Qianyi, Dakang, Runli, Tongyuan, and others came out to sell, causing the market price to fall. The trend is not easy to reverse in the short term. As a result, there was a uniform retracement of 45 cents to 1.2 yuan, with a turnover of about 1.5 million. A brief table is listed below:

### People Still Watching and Waiting - Chinese Stock Trading is Not Active

Yesterday's Chinese stock market situation still showed little improvement. Xinyao and Zhongfa Minyi became even more weak, each falling by 2 yuan. Xinya had buying activity and saw a slight rise. Department stores Yong'an and Xinxin remained stable as before. After deducting the share rights, underwear still had an oversupply, reducing by 5 cents. In the cultural industry, World Book Company retraced by 2.5 yuan. Commercial Press and Zhonghua showed no gains or losses, and turnover was also sparse. Zhabei Water and Electricity fell by another 5 cents. Chinese Thunder fell to the 30 yuan mark, with a small reduction of nearly one yuan. There were few transactions in Great China Matches, and the price of Nanyang Tobacco Company rose slightly by one yuan. According to various sources, people are still watching and waiting, and trading is not active. The stock price table is recorded separately below:

### Gold Jewelry Prices in Silver Shops Stabilize - Buyers Dare Not Buy, Dealers Reduce Prices

Yesterday, the price of gold jewelry in silver shops in this city, Daxin and its peers, was still listed at 2,200 yuan per tael (reducing by 350 yuan for purchases). The inter-dealer price was reduced from 1,940 yuan to around 1,900 yuan per tael. It stabilized at 1,920 yuan at noon, a reduction of 20-30 yuan, but buyers dared not buy. There was a difference of 40 yuan, and few transactions took place.

The price of silver ornaments was still listed at 16 yuan per tael, and the inter-dealer price was 11.34 yuan. The price of a silver coin fell to 4.23 yuan, it is said.

### Military Ticket Trading is Not Quiet - Inter-Dealer Prices Rise Slightly

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw military ticket inter-dealer trading that was not quiet. The price rose from 5.555 yuan to 5.553 yuan. Sales were made at the above price. The buying and selling prices of silver houses and money changers were the same as the previous day, selling at 5 yuan 6 jiao 5 and a half cents, and buying at 5 yuan 5 jiao 4 and a half cents, it is said.

Yesterday, the interest rate of the Money Industry Association did not change and was still listed at 1 jiao 8 fen. Newly drawn drafts were flat against cash, it is said.

### Increased Warehouse Rent - More Cotton Cloth Sellers - Market Continues to Decline

Yesterday, due to the increase in warehouse rent, sellers supplied as much as possible, and people's confidence was increasingly shaken. Therefore, the market continued to decline. The new market price for 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was 160 yuan, with a minimum of 164 yuan. It was pulled up to 166.5 yuan at closing. The bank price was 149 yuan, Caqiu fine cloth 151 yuan, Yanghe fine cloth 144 yuan, and Sijunzi drill red price 6 yuan 5 jiao 4 fen. The bank price was 6 yuan 3 jiao. Factory cloth followed the trend. 16-pound Earth coarse cloth 174 yuan, Feihong 171.5 yuan, 8-pound Zhenzhong coarse cloth 162 yuan, 12-pound Earth fine cloth 153 yuan, Dapeng 148 yuan, Fugui twill 128 yuan, and Chick calico 240 yuan, eventually 242 yuan. There was a lot of trading. It is reported that sales exceeded 20,000 pieces last week. Changshou fu silk 5 yuan 6 jiao, Qinmei Renyuan fine cloth 124 yuan, Peach Lady calico new opening price 250 yuan, closing price 248 yuan.

Summer Sales of Woolen Fabrics Decline

White drill, white straight, feather yarn, Palais, Pangpichu, Wanliding, spiral four, Ballet, burlap, Shekesdin and other summer woolen fabrics have all seen declining sales recently. Because the sales season is already short, those who have the ability to add production have mostly purchased Shuchi one after another. Those who do not have the ability to customize have mostly switched to fabric and old goods. Therefore, actual sales have come to an end, resulting in the recent summer woolen fabrics having very cheap retail and wholesale prices, but business is still sparse, it is said.

### Prolonged Drought and Lack of Rain - Rice Autumn Harvest is Worrisome

Since the weather turned sunny on the 2nd of last month, the climate has been exceptionally hot. For more than a month, there has been very little rain, and the weather has been dry and rainless, causing the rice fields in the surrounding suburbs to crack, and the rice ears are now white. Farmers are very worried. If there is no timely rain, it is feared that the rice autumn harvest will be disappointing, and people's faces are full of worry. The city's grain reserves are decreasing day by day, and the retail price of white rice in the rice shops is gradually tightening. The price of high-quality white japonica rice is now 450-460 yuan per picul, and even the slightly inferior thin rice is selling for 430-440 yuan.

As for the grain rations in the two concessions, the fifth phase has begun to be sold. The price and quantity are the same as the fourth phase. 1.5 liters of white rice sell for 3.8 yuan, and 1.5 jin of flour sell for 3.4 yuan. It is said that the deadline for purchasing rice in the fifth phase is 6:00 PM on the 8th (Saturday).

### Beans Arrive Sparsely and Sell Smoothly

The bean market has a scarce supply, and retail sales are said to be not quiet. The market trend is quite firm. Yesterday, 80 bags of Tianjin tea beans opened at a price of 130 yuan, 100 bags of Wuhu soybeans opened at a price of 180 yuan, and 50 bags of Chongming sand silkworm beans opened at a price of 112 yuan, an increase of 13 yuan compared to before.

Due to the prolonged sunny weather, soybean cake sales are also increasingly sluggish, and transactions are extremely sparse. Yesterday, only 100 bags of Zhanlizibing's May warehouse order were sold for 65 yuan.

### Oil Pressing Raw Materials Arrive and Sell Sparsely - Rapeseed 190 Yuan per Load, Cottonseed 60 Yuan per Batch

The price of rapeseed and cottonseed, the oil pressing raw materials, has been scarce recently. Rapeseed sells for about 190 yuan per load, and cottonseed for 60 yuan.

### Bran Sales Remain Clear

Bran sales were still not smooth yesterday, and the market continued to be weak. It is calculated that 100 bags of Sanxin small package bran from April 27 were priced at 98.5 yuan.

### Real Sales of Hardware in Small Quantities; Narrow Strip Iron Currently Enjoys Brisk Spot Sales

Hardware Transactions: Recently, it has been difficult to present a hot market. For the most part, sales of various goods have been stagnant. Only narrow strip iron sees relatively busy activity, due to its low price and good quality. Beer factories, soda factories, and canning factories use it mostly for making bottle caps. Furthermore, toy factories and cigarette factories also use it for decorative purposes. Thus, there is no shortage of bulk orders. Secondly, spot sales at door-to-door shops are also strong, as small workshops and artisans purchase it. Although the business is small, the activity is brisk. Therefore, dealers naturally have a good mindset, and prices are exceptionally firm. Retail prices range from seven or eight yuan to ten yuan per pound, depending on the size. A one-percent retail tax must also be paid to the Public Works Bureau. Wholesale transactions are difficult because of the shortage of patterns and grades in Shanghai, making it difficult to select goods. Most transactions involve bulk orders of mixed patterns and grades, currently priced at 1,500 yuan per case (200 pounds per case). Alternatively, pure small sizes or pure large sizes can be selected. Firstly, spot goods are scarce, and secondly, the market price is higher than mixed grades.

There are several reasons why actual sales of hardware are mostly in small quantities and fewer in bulk, making it difficult to achieve smooth transactions. These will be further detailed below:

Prolonged Interruption of Supply: This has impacted the inadequacy of the city's inventory. Currently, imports have come to a standstill, inevitably leading to a loss of confidence.

Stagnation of Out-of-Town Sales: This is a single blow to the channels for hardware sales. In the past, hardware sales were primarily driven by merchants from North China. In addition, merchants from Nanyang (Southeast Asia), along the Yangtze River, and from coastal ports shipped hardware from Shanghai. After this interruption, actual hardware sales will undoubtedly be hindered.

Slow Street Sales: In the past, local hardware businesses would break down bulk shipments, making for lively daily business. However, current sales are stagnant, and inventory is in short supply. Although businesses still occasionally break down bulk shipments among themselves, the activity is much slower.

Gradual Reduction in Factory Demand: In addition to sales to out-of-town merchants, sales to local factories also contributed significantly to hardware sales. Although some factories are still operating, and still occasionally require hardware, due to the weakening sales of their products (because high raw material costs lead to high prices for finished goods), factories are gradually reducing their purchases of raw materials. Another reason is that the variety of hardware available in Shanghai is no longer comprehensive. Even if they want to collect a large amount of spot goods, the shortage of inventory makes it difficult to find them, making bulk transactions difficult to complete. This is also why actual hardware sales are mostly in small quantities rather than bulk.

Door-to-door retail sales are slightly busier than sales to out-of-town merchants, street sales, and factory demand. For example, selling one pound of nails, five pounds of lead wire, one sheet of galvanized iron, or a few pounds of strip iron may seem busy, but the total sales revenue is probably not enough to cover daily expenses. The only reason for this is that overseas supply has been cut off, and the local inventory is very small. It is difficult to complete bulk transactions. However, door-to-door business continues in small quantities. This is the reason why actual hardware sales are mostly in small quantities rather than bulk. Therefore, it is difficult for the market prices of various goods to show prosperity. Yesterday's prices were: 750 yuan per barrel of common nails (200 pounds per barrel), 1,800 yuan per case of American Hui Si iron (200 pounds per case), 1,500 yuan for narrow strip iron, 16,000 yuan for black iron billets, 16,000 yuan for white lead wire, 14,000 yuan for new angle iron, and 16,000 yuan for coiled wire.

### No Improvement in Sugar Shares

Sugar shares of the sugar merchants' cooperative sales office, yesterday's public guild quotations, transaction became even scarcer, the trend is even weaker, the opening of coarse sugar shares was at 301 yuan, and then due to the scarcity of buyers, it broke the 300 yuan mark, even closed at 298 yuan, a drop of two and a half yuan before and after, red sugar shares opened at 285 yuan, and 600 packages were traded.

### Empress Theater to Switch to Peking Opera

— By Bing Wei

Zhou Xiru Gives a Speech

Recently, various cinemas have been switching to stage plays due to the disruption of imported films and the limited production of domestic films. The Empress Theater emerged during the film shortage period. Therefore, it ceased operations shortly after its establishment. However, this is a desirable location, and people in the industry regard it as a coveted spot. They competed fiercely, each offering ingenious plans. Ultimately, the high rent proved too daunting, and the competitors retreated, realizing the difficulty. Recently, Lixing Company rented the theater from manager Zhang Songtao for an astonishing price of 60,000 yuan, with a long-term contract of one year, to stage Peking Opera. To clarify the truth, I visited Zhou Xiru, the head of Lixing Company, at his residence yesterday (Mr. Zhou is a famous Peking Opera amateur in Shanghai, specializing in male roles, excelling in both singing and acting). He informed me of the following, which I record below: (The following is Mr. Zhou's statement)

Promoting Peking Opera, Not for Profit

I have been working in the insurance industry and am a first-time venture into founding a theater. The idea of renting the Empress Theater arose from casual conversations with friends. Many people encouraged me, and my friend Mr. Zhang Jingshou, a timber magnate, also generously offered assistance and substantial investment. Therefore, a decision was made, and preparations began. A detailed plan was drawn up in a few days, with a fixed capital of one million yuan. The contract was signed with the other party the day before yesterday. Now, we are proceeding with the interior decoration and inviting Peking Opera performers. Mr. Zhang is passionate about Peking Opera, so the purpose of taking over the Empress Theater is to promote the art, not to make a profit.

Attaching Great Importance to the Ensemble, Not Hesitating to Spend Heavily

The ensemble of a Peking Opera theater is more important than any lead actor. This is why gold can endure the test of time. From the very beginning, our theater has made a firm decision regarding the ensemble. Even the most minor roles, such as the extras, will be filled by well-trained and skilled performers. We will not hesitate to spend heavily on recruiting other talents to achieve perfection.

Striving for Eye-Catching Stage Design

Currently, Peking Opera theaters do not pay much attention to stage design. Our theater is entering the field later and should take on the responsibility of improvement. We will strive to improve the color of the curtains, the position of the stage, and the realism of the props, without violating the abstract principles of Peking Opera.

Initial Cast, Probably Shang Xiaoyun

Our theater is a joint-stock company. The chairman of the board is Huang Zhensheng, and the general manager is Zhang Jingshou. I am honored to be the manager in charge of all matters. The opening date is scheduled for the eleventh day of the eighth month of the lunar calendar. The initial cast is planned to include Shang Xiaoyun, one of the four great female roles, and the male role performer Zhou Xiaotian. We have already sent invitations, and we are waiting for their reply. I will fly to Beijing on the sixth with Lu Jiying and Liu Huatang to invite the cast. If we cannot reach an agreement with Shang Xiaoyun, we will choose one of Jin Shaoshan or Xi Xiaobo. The pay in Shanghai is quite high, and the cost of inviting performers is substantial. The ticket prices will inevitably be slightly higher, but we will set the lowest possible ticket prices to benefit the audience, based on our financial capabilities.

### Anecdotes of Mei Wan Hua

— Tongxia

Mei Lanfang's return to Shanghai from Hong Kong has been repeatedly delayed, attracting attention from all walks of life, and even causing various rumors. His sudden arrival in Shanghai at noon dispelled the doubts. It is learned that Mr. Mei has recently suffered from heart and throat congestion, which may prevent him from appearing on stage again. He will likely retire; however, he will continue to draw on his reserves and reform old plays to fulfill his long-held aspirations.

Mr. Mei is forty-nine years old, his youth remains and his face glows. He studies constantly, whether in the summer or winter. The garden of Kang Le (his residence) is also his private stage. He was born in Beijing in 1893 in the Western calendar. His grandfather and father were both famous actors. At the age of thirteen, he first appeared as a young female character, and his artistry improved day by day. In just a few years, he achieved great success. At the age of nineteen, he first came to Shanghai and was elected as the "King of the Actors" with 270,000 votes.

In ancient times, singing and dancing were equally important. After the Tang Dynasty, dancing was abandoned and singing was emphasized. Mr. Mei believed that dancing should not be completely abandoned, so he self-compiled scripts, such as "The Heavenly Maiden Scattering Flowers," which was particularly praised by the world. At the age of twenty-five, he was hired to the Queen's Theater in Japan, and was well received by all walks of life. At the age of twenty-eight, he came to Hong Kong and then to Shanghai. The Governor of Hong Kong encouraged him to travel to England, and he eventually obtained a silver shield and returned.

Mr. Mei has more than 400 plays that he can perform, most of which are self-compiled. The costumes and props are estimated to be worth 100,000 gold. He has a rich singing voice and a beautiful face. It is fitting that his fame is so great.

Mr. Mei is kind and compassionate. He often donates his performances to charity and is never one to fall behind. Previously, at the Beijing Charity Fundraising Association, one of his photos was auctioned in public and was obtained by a Spanish consular official for 500 yuan.

In 1930, he led a troupe to perform in the United States in New York and Washington, D.C. People in the United States unanimously praised him and he obtained an American degree. He returned to China in the summer of the same year. In 1935, he traveled to Russia and also enjoyed great fame. However, Mr. Mei's initial ambition was to travel around the world to gain the benefit of observation. However, there is no way to preserve youth, and youth is difficult to relive. This may become an unrealizable ideal.

### Scenes from the Art World

— Yi

After the merger of the Tuen Union, new films have been released one after another. Recently, a fresh, specially-made film is being planned, with all the directors working together. Chen Yunshang, Yuan Meiyun, Chen Yanyan, Gu Lanjun, Li Lihua, Zhou Manhua, and Hu Feng, seven beauties, will jointly star in seven short films featuring different personalities. It is said that the outline has been drawn, and the work is huge. It will soon be mobilized for filming.

The Chinese Opera Troupe, led by Sun Jinglu, once sat in the Carlton Theatre, performing "Peking Man," and made a considerable profit. They continued to perform for half a month at the Green Gem. It is said that after performing Cao Yu's trilogy "Sunrise," "Thunderstorm," and "Wilderness," they will perform "Xiaofeng Canyue," written by Zhou Yibai. The script fee has already been paid.

After Qing Shangguan Yunzhu joined the China Travel Troupe, her strength increased greatly. She made a strong first shot at the Empress Theater with "Tears of the Setting Sun," adopting a multi-role system with equal development. Everyone has a heavy role. Tang Ruoqing and his father, Tang Huaiqiu, are collaborating for the second time after "Tears of Scented Paper," which is refreshing for the audience of the Empress Theater.

The Lafayette Garden Theatre has no news of being rented out recently. After the New Voice Troupe suffered a disastrous defeat, the front stage is still busy. Various active troupes and amateur troupes are seizing this summer opportunity to perform in early shows. It is also rumored that the newly established Youth Troupe is in contact with the authorities of Lafayette and has signed a contract for long-term performances.

### Recording the Amateur Actor Mr. Zhao Peixin

— Zhi Yu

Mr. Zhao Peixin is from Wuxian, Jiangsu. He is a talented amateur actor in the Ma school of male roles in Shanghai. Ten years ago, he studied male roles with the famous teacher Chan Bao Fu together with Mr. Sun Junqing. Although his teacher's performance was profound and difficult to follow, he focused on imitating it and roughly resembled him in general. Later, he formed a sworn brotherhood with Ma Lianliang, and after being influenced by him for a long time, he fully grasped the essence of the Ma school.

In 1932, he performed charity shows for the Hankou flood and with Mei Wan Hua and Cheng Yanqiu in Shanghai and Hangzhou: "Fenhe Bay," "The Fourth Son Visits His Mother," "Ganlu Temple," and "Killing the Fisherman."

Mr. Zhao is eager to help others. He enthusiastically participates in all charity performances related to public welfare. This time, for the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital and the Tongren Fuyuantang, he was specially invited to perform Peking Opera as a guest performer at the Golden Grand Theater to raise funds. Mr. Zhao believed that it was his duty to do so for the sake of public welfare. He has agreed to perform for four days starting today (5th). The plays are extremely solid. On the evening of the 5th, he will perform the entire "The Fourth Son Visits His Mother." On the evening of the 6th, he will perform "Baolian Lantern" and "Killing the Fisherman." On the evening of the 7th, he will perform "Famen Temple" and "Ganlu Temple." On the evening of the 8th, Mr. Shao Changling, the president of the Yuecheng Amateur Troupe, will donate 25,000 yuan to have Mr. Zhao perform the complete "The Injustice Done to Dou E".

Mr. Zhao wrote in his own words: "After the end of this charity performance, I may allocate some funds to support the 'Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund' to benefit poor students." His generosity is admirable.

### A Stroll Through the Lido Garden

— Zhayi

The thermometer rises above ninety-eight degrees, such hot weather. During the day, we work, sweating all day long. In the evening, we want to find a place to relax our tired minds. Great! Let's go to the night garden. On a Saturday night, I finally decided to visit the Lido Garden.

The entire staff of the Lido Dance Hall - the band and the dancers - has now moved to the garden. This feels great: because dancing in the garden dance floor to music amplified by the microphone is not as exciting as dancing in front of a live band. Also, if you don't like dancing, you can enjoy the sights and sounds. When I stepped into the garden - the Lido, I saw that the dance floor was already full of seated guests. I found a seat in a corner deep in the green shade. The lush flowers and trees, the bright lights, and the gentle breeze brought a fragrant aroma. Instantly, my tired mind was restored. Especially the music of Don Josie, exciting and stimulating!

I've experienced the vicissitudes of life, but my interest in dancing is not just for dancing. It is to enjoy the atmosphere of elegant clothing and beautiful women, sipping tea and enjoying the cool air, admiring the natural scenery - the clear breeze and bright moon, truly enjoying the summer.

The Lido Garden Hotel is another feature. The cuisine here is similar to that of the Nanhua Hotel, and the dining room is extremely luxurious. Dining and dancing can be said to be an unusual garden dance hall. In short, everything in Lido is worth cherishing. If you don't care about the cost, this is enough for you to enjoy. As I walked out of the Lido gate, on the way home in the dim night, I thought.

### The Truth of Married Life

— Yi Qing

"White-Clad Angel" Has a Clear Answer

We believe that "White-Clad Angel" will stir the emotions of everyone, making you unable to help but burst into tears!

In every corner, tragedies between men and women are constantly occurring. The problems are mostly due to the lack of true understanding between the two parties, resulting in extremes. Even one side becomes passive and depressed. Zhou Manhua and Shu Shi in "White-Clad Angel" are a couple united in this way. Fortunately, Zhou Manhua broke away from her small circle of life and entered the hospital to serve. At the same time, Shu Shi was injured in a car accident. Zhou Manhua, based on the principle of alleviating a patient's suffering, did not hesitate to donate blood to save Shu Shi's life. After such twists and turns, the sincere expression of both parties' attitudes, they truly fell in love.

This story reveals the truth of married life - when one party is misunderstood by the other, the most effective way to express sincerity is to feel the pain of the other.

In addition to revealing this truth to the public, "White-Clad Angel" indirectly points out that a wife does not necessarily have to depend on her husband to survive. She can also be self-reliant, and forgiving someone's mistakes is one of the greatest virtues of mankind.

### Prelude to "Human World": Lan Lan's Acting Skills Advance Significantly

"Human World" is Hu Tiwei's first stage play. When every acquaintance read the script, they all expressed unexpected satisfaction. Tiwei's literary cultivation is profound. His first attempt at writing a stage play is so mature and fluent in terms of structure and technique. It is truly an unexpected harvest for the theater world.

Now, "Human World" will finally be presented at the Carlton tonight.

Reporters have visited rehearsals several times. The clarity and fluency of the stage lines are comparable to those of Mr. Cao Yu. Each character's personality is clearly defined in the lines. There are no vague shortcomings in the division of scenes. Hong Mo's efforts to handle the exquisite details also help to develop the atmosphere. What is especially worth mentioning is that Miss Lan Lan's acting skills, since "Women's Apartment," seem to have fallen into a stereotype. Here, it cannot be denied, she has made progress. She grasps the tragic and contradictory personality of the character in the play. The character is a woman who has been baptized by new knowledge. Because of vanity, she abandons her lover and marries a businessman. When she meets her lover again after many years, her lover still loves her, but her lover has come to see her husband. In this situation, if Lan Lan does not do her best, how can she express it?

### Li Baosun Becomes a Disciple of Wang Yaoqing

— Ruoqi

Li Baoyi, a famous amateur actor from Changsha, has been playing amateur roles for more than ten years. He is good at singing famous plays of the Mei school, and his beauty in appearance is unanimously praised by insiders and outsiders. Recently, in order to further improve his acting skills, Mr. Li took his family to Beijing and formally became a disciple of Wang Yaoqing at Wang's residence in Dama Temple on July 1. According to Mr. Li's letter, he is staying at the residence of Jin Zhongren at No. 5 Wei Ran Hutong, Xuanwai. After Zhu Guifang returns to the north, he plans to learn "Lian Jin Feng," "Xi Shi," and "The Legend of Tai Zhen." In addition, in terms of singing, he plans to consult with the famous musicians Xu Lanyuan and Wang Shaoqing. Once the autumn cools down, he also plans to give a performance in Beijing.

### Brief News

On the opening day of the Jue Lu Song Court, it was unprecedentedly grand, and the box office was excellent. The owner of the court donated one-tenth of the income, totaling 500 yuan, to the Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund to benefit poor scholars. We hereby express our gratitude.

### Sharing the Same Boat Through Storms

— He Jia Zhi

(7) Thunder and Lightning

Wei Cheng heard a sound that disturbed him. He mumbled, "Oh! He finally revealed his true colors." Second Madam Ye said, "Later, Cheng Bing didn't write for quite some time. Your father and mother had almost forgotten about Cheng Bing. Your mother had you, and you had been born for quite some time. Suddenly, one day, your father returned from Shanghai and was brutally beaten on the road. At that time, it was getting dark, and we couldn't see clearly who came. There were at least a dozen people who didn't say a word, just beat him silently. Your father was sitting in a rickshaw. The rickshaw puller saw that they were coming fiercely, so he had to stay aside, feeling helpless and unable to speak up. The attackers dispersed. The rickshaw puller couldn't pull the rickshaw anymore, so he carried your father back on his back. Your mother served your father day and night, and took care of you while secretly shedding tears. I was widowed when I married into the family. Hearing this news, I accompanied your mother and shed a lot of tears. Your father was injured, and in less than three days, he saw more than a dozen doctors, including trauma, surgical, and internal medicine doctors, but it was still ineffective. On his deathbed, he only said one sentence: 'The person who beat me won't be a second person.' Your mother naturally understood when she heard it, but none of us knew what he was talking about. Wei Cheng, you were eleven years old, and your mother never said a word about it in front of me. When you were twelve, your mother suffered a serious illness. Needless to say, since your father's death, illness was a common occurrence, but this year it was a major illness, so ill that she was delirious. I served her, and she told me about the past, saying that we were all widows, and my son was your son. After I die, you must never tell what I told you to me and your son. Wei Cheng, that's exactly what your mother told me at that time. Now you see your mother's will, and the words in the will are slightly different from what your mother told me. This is because she later changed her previous plans. In that period, she really didn't want you to take revenge." Wei Cheng patted his chest, exhaled, and asked, "So, it's still not certain that Cheng Bing beat my father to death?" (146)
