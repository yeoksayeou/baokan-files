### Talk by Japanese Army Commander Honma in Tianjin: Japan's Goal is to Destroy British Interests in North China; No Anti-American Movement in North China Because America Does Not Control Any Part Therein

Tianjin: The Japanese Army Commander in Tianjin, Honma, stated today that the goal of the Japanese army in China is to eliminate foreign domination. However, since America does not control any part of China, there is no anti-American movement in North China. As for Britain, it is in a position of control in North China, and therefore the people have expressed anti-British sentiments. However, the American side believes that we have anti-American actions, which is purely due to a failure to clearly understand Japan's goals. He also said that although Japan's goal is to destroy British dominance in North China, it will not necessarily harm the businesses of British and other foreigners in North China. Honma continued, "After the expiration of the US-Japan Commercial Treaty, we hope to establish a temporary agreement with the US. If the US exempts Japanese goods or ships from special taxes, Japan will be satisfied. Therefore, Japan's intention is to first establish a temporary agreement with the US." According to Honma, America's intention to establish defenses in Guam is worse than abolishing the US-Japan Commercial Treaty. In short, if the US does not conclude a new commercial treaty with Japan and also establishes defenses in Guam, Japan will inevitably regard this action by the US as unfriendly.

### The Chinese Army in Shandong Charges into Shu Shui

### Six Japanese Writers Conduct Radio Propaganda for China on the Guilin Front, Led by Wataru Nukada, Urging Soldiers Not to Fight for Warlords

Chongqing: Several well-known Japanese writers are currently assisting the Chinese authorities in Nanning by conducting radio propaganda in Japanese, urging Japanese soldiers not to fight for their warlords. There are six of them, led by Wataru Nukada, who are members of the Japanese Anti-War Association in China. They arrived in Guilin Province on December 28th of last year and immediately inspected the positions of the Chinese army to select suitable locations for broadcasting. They have broadcasted for six nights so far. The first broadcast was made on December 29th on a mountain northeast of Kunlun Pass. At that time, the Chinese army was fiercely attacking the key pass. When the broadcast began, the Chinese army stopped firing as planned to avoid disturbing the sound waves. At that time, the Japanese army was only 300 meters away from the broadcast location. As soon as a certain Japanese writer spoke, saying, "Hey, our dear Japanese compatriots," the sound of Japanese machine guns immediately rang out. As soon as the gunfire stopped, the Japanese member continued to speak. They were located on a mountain 2,000 meters high, and the night was quiet, so the voices were very clear. The conclusion was to give the Japanese army one hour to surrender, with three shots fired into the air as a signal. When the deadline arrived, the Japanese army guarding the pass did not respond, so the Chinese army continued to open fire and attack. According to the Chinese side, the radio propaganda has been very effective. Although no Japanese soldiers surrendered, when the Chinese army attacked the next morning, the Japanese army offered only slight resistance, unlike the fierce resistance before. When the Chinese army advanced south towards Nanning, these six Japanese writers continued to broadcast on the front line. Each person had a pistol, according to their leader, Wataru Nukada, this was to prevent being captured by the Japanese army, as they would inevitably not be spared and it would be better to commit suicide. Wataru Nukada also stated that they will continue to broadcast to Japanese soldiers on the front line. (Reuters report, 15th)

### Chinese Authorities Striving to Build Highways

Chongqing: According to official sources, the Chinese authorities are currently striving to build new highways and improve existing highways. The National Government has allocated 12 million yuan for the improvement of the 960-kilometer-long Yunnan-Burma Highway, so that it can remain open to traffic as usual during the rainy season. It is reported that the average daily traffic on this road is 600 tons. It is estimated that the annual maintenance expenses for this road will require 8-9 million yuan, while the annual highway maintenance fees collected will amount to approximately 4 million yuan. Currently, the total length of highways in the southwestern provinces is 4,789 kilometers, and in the northwestern provinces, it is 3,400 kilometers. (Reuters report, 15th)

Chongqing: According to news received here today, the Ministry of Communications is now allocating huge funds to improve highways in the Chinese interior. The improvement plan for the Yunnan-Burma Highway, which is 960 kilometers long, has now been completed, costing 12 million yuan. It is reported that after the completion of the plan, the road can still be passable even if it encounters the rainy season and flash floods, without being restricted by the weather. Therefore, the daily transportation volume can reach 6 million tons. The newly built Kunming-Luzhou Highway, which is 600 miles long, has now been extended to 914 kilometers. It is reported that the Ministry of Communications now stipulates that the annual expenditure for improving road administration is 89,000,000 yuan, and the aspects of improvement include road surface, roadbed, bridges, stations, and repair shops.

### Women's Groups in Chongqing Comfort the Air Force

Chongqing: Women's groups, including the National Women's慰勞 (consolation and encouragement) General Association and the Municipal Women's Association, have been sending comfort to the Chinese air force officers and soldiers who have bravely fought and killed the Japanese, with frequent reports of victory, especially the previous air battle in Liuzhou, in which eight Japanese planes were shot down and the Chinese army suffered no damage, resulting in a great victory. They specially organized a慰勞 (consolation and encouragement) delegation to visit and comfort them on the 15th, with Ma Shen Huilian serving as the general representative. First, they presented flowers to a certain general to express their respect, then Ma Shen Xuanlian and Zhu Lun, on behalf of various groups, delivered speeches to the air force officers and soldiers to express their condolences and presented慰勞 (consolation and encouragement) goods. Again, Tang Guozhen, on behalf of the Women's慰勞 (consolation and encouragement) General Association, presented a banner inscribed with "威震東亞" (Awe-Inspiring in East Asia), and Huang Peilan, on behalf of the Municipal Women's Association, presented a banner inscribed with "壯志凌雲" (Soaring Ambitions). Finally, they performed entertainment and then dispersed. (Telegram, 15th)

### Change of Japanese Cabinet: Used to Alleviate Domestic Crisis; Chongqing Personage's Observation of Yonai's Cabinet Formation

Chongqing: Official sources are still not commenting on the new Japanese cabinet today, awaiting the disclosure of the full list of cabinet members. However, according to Chinese sources familiar with Japanese affairs, the Yonai cabinet may be a transitional cabinet during a chaotic period until a more suitable person is found for the position of Prime Minister. Yonai, in the Konoe and Hiranuma cabinets, had vigorously opposed Japan's conclusion of a military alliance with Germany and Italy. Yonai studied in Britain and is known in Japan as a "liberal." His selection this time may be because Japan intends to adopt a compromise policy towards Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. At the same time, it is also because it is difficult for another army figure to control the lower-ranking officers of the army. This is why the initial call for Army Minister Hata Shunroku was very high, because Hata Shunroku is a "conservative" figure who earned credit in the Battle of Hankou, and it is widely believed that he can control the young and middle-aged elements in the army. The Abe cabinet lasted four months and eighteen days. Before that, Japan had a total of thirty-seven cabinets, of which nine were organized by army ministers and five by navy ministers. Generally speaking, Japanese cabinets last longer when facing acute international situations, but they are very short-lived when encountering domestic disputes. The Yonai cabinet may not be colorful, because it does not have the full support of the army, nor does it have the support of overseas elements to change Japan's international relations. Chinese sources believe that Konoe and Hata Shunroku's refusal to accept the position of Prime Minister shows that important factions still disagree on extremely important issues, such as the "China Incident" and policies towards the United States. Some people here believe that the main purpose of electing Yonai is to find someone to cope with the upcoming Diet session. The new Prime Minister opposes Itagaki's policies and is especially opposed to the alliance with Germany and Italy and economic mobilization. Therefore, Yonai may be able to alleviate the relationship between the various parties in the Diet and financial and industrial groups. After the domestic crisis is temporarily eased, Yonai will be replaced by someone who is widely believed to be able to resolve the Sino-Japanese issue and serve as Prime Minister.

Editorial

### The New Japanese Cabinet and US-Japan Relations

We have already briefly reviewed the downfall of the Japanese Abe cabinet in yesterday's newspaper. After much effort, Mitsumasa Yonai, who was ordered to organize the successor cabinet, has finalized the selection of all cabinet members. Yonai is a navy admiral, a prominent figure among the navy militarists, but he is also relatively gentle and stable. The new Foreign Minister is Hachiro Arita. If the Japanese militarists do not just allow him to be a phonograph, only allowing him to be a spokesperson, he should be able to follow the general laws of international diplomacy; compared to Abe's initial self-serving as Foreign Minister, and even later inviting General Nomura to be Foreign Minister, although they were not phonographs or spokespersons, in terms of the diplomatic stage, they were ultimately like "amateurs" or "cross-dressers." If we talk about international standards: Arita is not a magnificent diplomat, but he is still a capable and competent diplomat. Does Japan have diplomats? Especially in this era where militarists are in power, invasion has failed and they cannot repent, can diplomats be produced? This is another question, not to be discussed; but even if diplomats are capable and competent, it will ultimately be of no avail. Arita's debut this time will probably not win a cheer! It is not that Arita is not good enough, but because Japan's foundation is precarious, and it is even more deeply involved in misguided paths. Even if diplomats are tongue-tied and exhausted, what help can they provide?

The debut, ten days from now, the US-Japan Commercial Treaty will expire on the 26th of this month. On the American side, the attitude of both the government and the public is firm: on the Japanese side, although the new cabinet will declare its attitude when it is fully organized, the public opinion circle has expressed various tough arguments. For example, the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun stated that if the "New Order in East Asia" and the US-Japan Commercial Treaty are not compatible, it would rather abandon the latter; the military's mouthpiece, the Miyako Shimbun, predicted that the future new cabinet should adopt a more resolute attitude towards the United States and create a more friendly atmosphere between the Soviet Union and Japan. Rather than thinking of these expressions as the political views of a certain group of people, it is actually better to say that they are a kind of external intimidation. Because it is extremely obvious that small Japan cannot replace America with the Soviet Union, and if there is no supply of American military materials, the establishment of the so-called "New Order in East Asia" will also become a bubble. Even in terms of the Japanese political situation, although the cabinet has been changed, unless the elder statesmen and financial groups completely lose control, or the extreme right wing of the military forces Yonai and Arita to act, perhaps they will really embark on a path of being pro-Soviet and anti-American; otherwise, the diplomacy afterwards will not be a so-called policy, it will only be that diplomats will do their best to respond to the situation; at most, they will make more partial concessions in an attempt to ease the foreign opposition.

Looking at the recent American public opinion towards Japan, it is actually becoming more and more激昂(aroused); even for the government authorities and Mr. Pittman and others, although their attitude is slightly more cautious, their fundamental starting point is actually the same as the most radical anti-Japanese theorists, coming from justice, humanity, and the maintenance of the Nine-Power Treaty. It is definitely not just about respecting and maintaining rights and interests in China. Even if Japan's concessions reach the maximum extent, it will only give some excuses and new materials to the American propagandists and some Americans who only care about immediate interests; it is not enough to ease the general American sentiment towards Japan, and it is even more not enough to shake America's determination to stabilize the Far East situation, or reduce America's established policy. So the central question at the moment is not what Japan's public opinion stance is, or what the diplomat's skills are, but how to enable President Roosevelt of the United States and other government and public figures to implement their great vision.

Of course, there are also considerable differences in opinion among Americans; for example, in reviewing Stimson's recent paper, the New York Times raised the issue of other countries' attitudes toward Japan; implying that the United States also has room to hesitate. We do not object to the United States'휴休有容 (easy and tolerant) approach, giving Japan the opportunity to maintain its glory and correct itself, change itself, and voluntarily abandon its policy of aggression; but from July 26 of last year to the present, Japan has not made good use of this half-year opportunity. Therefore, we believe that what the New York Times discusses should be given leeway in application, but it must also be limited; and in terms of morality and interests, we must recognize that there is absolutely no room for compromise. In the eight or nine years since the "September 18th" Incident, there have indeed been many opportunities to contain aggression and eliminate the crisis in the Far East, but it was only due to the inertia of the leaders of the great powers, disordered steps, indecisiveness, 寡斷優柔 (irresolution),養癰貽忠 (nurturing a boil to the detriment of the body), which led to the uncontrollable spread of the sparks of fire, threatening the安髯 (tranquility) of the whole world, and indirectly promoting the outbreak of storms in Europe. And now Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and other countries have already been involved in the vortex of war, and at this time, it is certainly no longer possible to lavishly talk about coordinating policy towards Japan; however, regardless of how the interests of various countries are related in other respects, if we only talk about the Far East, the threats and persecutions they have suffered from Japan are actually always the same for all countries. What's more, the day that the basic military deployment of the Japanese warlords' southward and northward advances is completed, they can be put into use at any time. Even if the great powers do not abandon their policy of using Japan as bait to flood the neighbors, it will at most only be enough to maintain a temporary peace, but on the other hand, they are precisely making it a tool for the Japanese warlords to threaten other countries, which is harmful and unprofitable to both others and themselves. Counting all the great powers related to the Far East, there is no country that has common interests with Japan today, and no country benefits from Japan's conquest of China. This is absolutely without a second conclusion in terms of morality and interests. If the countries cannot come to the same conclusion, then it is absolutely not enough to guarantee their significant rights and interests in the Far East, nor is it enough to eliminate the serious threats they are suffering in the Far East. Today's America is the largest power that has not been drawn into the war, and is also the most powerful protector of world justice and order. Its use of foreign policy can be independent, and it does not need to consult other countries, and the Far East policy of various countries will inevitably tend to stabilize due to the strength of the American attitude. Japan has historically been unable to understand the meaning and determination of the United States, and has repeatedly made mistakes; now that it can understand the United States fairly well, but as in the Hiranuma and Abe eras, wanting to use Germany and the Soviet Union, as well as the recent虛聲恐嚇 (empty threats) of the Mainichi Shimbun and the Miyako Shimbun, have revealed that Japan still does not understand that the interests of various countries and the United States in the Far East are consistent. Yonai and Arita's debut may not be able to do much, but being able to correct the domestic lack of understanding of the international situation is a contribution to the country. Whether Yonai and Arita can make this contribution can be glimpsed at the time of the expiration of the US-Japan Commercial Treaty.

### Japan Hopes to Conclude a Temporary Commercial Treaty, Awaiting a Reply from the United States. The U.S. Government Apparently Unwilling to Change Its Stance, Demanding Japanese Guarantees of American Interests in China.

Washington - Official sources stated today that the U.S.-Japan trade crisis triggered by the Washington government's declaration to abolish the 1911 U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty has reached a stalemate. There is no hope of signing a transitional treaty before the expiration of the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty on the 26th of this month. Secretary of State Hull remained tight-lipped about the resignation of the Abe Cabinet in Tokyo, but the U.S. State Department's attitude clearly has not changed, namely, that Japan must bear full responsibility for any actions to improve U.S.-Japan relations. It is generally believed that the State Department's attitude is that Japan must prove that it is prepared to protect American interests in China. Well-informed sources indicated that if the State Department cannot obtain satisfactory guarantees from the new Japanese cabinet within a reasonable period, Congress is free to enact measures to prohibit the export of arms and raw materials to Japan. They also indicated that if the Tokyo government cannot protect American interests in China, Hull may expand the scope of moral sanctions against Japan, prohibiting the export of certain military supplies to Japan. The Japanese Embassy here declined to comment on the future of U.S.-Japan trade. Japanese Ambassador to the United States Kensuke Horinouchi was bedridden yesterday due to influenza, but embassy staff worked throughout Sunday, extremely busy. U.S. officials believe that the Japanese Yonai Mitsumasa cabinet, with Hachiro Arita as Foreign Minister, may adopt a friendly attitude towards the United States. (United Press Dispatch, 15th)

Tokyo - A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated to reporters this morning that Japan hopes the U.S. State Department will take action before January 16th (the date of expiration of the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty). It is expected that the continuation of Japan's foreign policy will remain unchanged. Japanese Ambassador to the United States Horinouchi submitted a draft of a temporary agreement to U.S. Secretary of State Hull on December 23rd, but he could not say for sure what form the temporary agreement would take if it were concluded, as there are several possible forms, such as an exchange of diplomatic notes between the two countries. Regarding the issue of the "new central government" in China, according to news from China, preparations by the Chinese for the establishment of a new regime are "proceeding smoothly." Wang Jingwei, Chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the orthodox Kuomintang, Wang Kemin, head of the Beiping Provisional Government, and Liang Hongzhi, head of the Nanjing "Reform Government," the "three giants," are about to hold a meeting, but he declined to disclose the date and location of this meeting. As for the incident on Christmas Day when Japanese soldiers burned down the United Methodist Church Hospital near Wuding Prefecture in Shandong Province, the spokesman said he was unaware of the matter and believed that the British side had not lodged a protest. (Reuters, 15th)

Washington - With only a few days remaining before the current U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty expires on January 26th, official circles have remained tight-lipped about the future of U.S.-Japan relations. At the same time, irresponsible rumors have been rife. One thing that can be considered accurate is that a new treaty cannot be signed solely by the President. While the President can use his authority to abolish a treaty, only Congress can establish a new one. The general expectation in diplomatic circles here is that after January 26th, the measures contained in the current commercial treaty will be temporarily allowed to continue, so that neither new treaties are negotiated, nor are there drastic changes to the existing measures. However, it must be stated that official circles have not acknowledged the above predictions, so the true state of U.S.-Japan relations cannot be known until official circles break their silence.

### Emperor Reportedly Supports the Army; Yonai Completes Cabinet Formation; Army Minister Hata and Navy Minister Yoshida Both Retained; Arita Appointed Foreign Minister, Sakurauchi Appointed Finance Minister; Seiyukai and Minseito Each Occupy Two Seats

Tokyo - The Yonai Cabinet has recently been formed, with the following lineup: Prime Minister, Admiral Mitsumasa Yonai; Foreign Minister, former Foreign Minister Hachiro Arita; Interior Minister, Hideo Kodama; Finance Minister, Sakio Sakurauchi of the Minseito party; Army Minister, General Shunroku Hata (retained); Navy Minister, Admiral Zengo Yoshida (retained); Justice Minister, Chief Prosecutor Naotatsu Kimura; Education Minister, Privy Councilor Townjirou Matsuura; Agriculture Minister, Toshio Shimada of the Seiyukai's Nakajima faction; Commerce Minister, Ginjiro Fujiwara; Communications Minister, Masasame Katsu of the Minseito party; Railways Minister, Tsuruhei Matsuno of the Seiyukai's Kuhara faction; Colonial Affairs Minister, General Kuniaki Koiso; Welfare Minister, Shigeru Yoshida (former Chief Cabinet Secretary); Chief Cabinet Secretary, Jotaro Ishiwata (former Finance Minister); Director-General of the Legislation Bureau, Hisatada Hirose (former Welfare Minister). (Domei News Agency, 15th) After Emperor conferred on former Navy Minister Admiral Yonai the mandate to form a cabinet, he summoned former Army Minister General Shunroku Hata for consultation. According to General Hata's statement upon returning to the Ministry of the Army, the Emperor earnestly hoped that the Army would assist Admiral Yonai in forming a new cabinet. (Havas, 14th)

Tokyo - Admiral Yonai, upon receiving the mandate to form a cabinet, will personally serve as Chairman of the Cabinet, and will simultaneously be placed on the reserve list in accordance with the Navy Military Service Ordinance. However, in view of Admiral Yonai's achievements and his flexible political skills, the Navy authorities hope that Yonai will remain an active-duty military officer and are currently studying the procedures and methods. (Domei News Agency, 15th)

Tokyo - As a result of deliberations at the Cabinet Formation Headquarters, it was decided to request that the Minseito and Seiyukai parties each send two members to the cabinet. Yonai also hopes that the heads of both parties will enter the cabinet, and is scheduled to invite representatives from both parties today to express their views. (Domei News Agency, 15th)

Tokyo - After former Navy Minister Admiral Yonai was ordered to form a cabinet, foreign observers here have commented that Admiral Yonai has long opposed the idea of concluding a military alliance with Germany, and this idea ultimately failed. As for his attitude towards Britain and the United States, this man has always been moderate. For this reason, the Yonai Cabinet is likely to reverse the actions of the previous Abe Cabinet, no longer pursuing the Soviet Union, but instead seeking to establish normal relations with Britain and the United States. It is expected that this policy will gain the support of the majority of the people in the country. As for former Army Minister General Shunroku Hata, there was an original proposal for him to form a cabinet, and the Army leadership even resolved on the morning of today to allow an active-duty general to serve as prime minister, but General Hata ultimately refused to form a cabinet. The reason for this is that some ten aspects of the military were deeply concerned that if a cabinet headed by an active-duty general adopted decisions opposed by the military in the future, it would cause a subtle situation. Therefore, they were vehemently opposed to the proposal for General Hata to serve as prime minister. Furthermore, it is widely rumored among political circles that the reason why powerful elements of the Japanese moderate faction advocated that General Shunroku Hata form a cabinet was that they secretly hoped that he would fail due to incompetence, so that the military would never interfere in politics again. For these reasons, although the Army leadership allowed an active-duty general to form a cabinet, it was on the condition that the general retire from active duty after the successful formation of the cabinet. General Hata reportedly told his friends, "If I take off my military uniform, I will become a child and be unable to do anything. The reason why I am valued by all parties is because I wear a military sword. Moreover, it is the military, not the government itself, that drives the government. I am willing to drive the government, but I am not comfortable being driven at the same time." (Havas, 15th)

Tokyo - The character of the new Yonai Cabinet is seen as a unified national cabinet of the military, political parties, and the financial world. Its mission is to handle the China Incident, with particular emphasis on actively assisting the establishment and growth of the new Chinese regime. This means implementing the basic policy on dealing with the new regime, which was decided upon by the Abe Cabinet's temple council. However, concurrently with this mission, another focus of the new cabinet is the resolution of domestic problems, which are the very problems that led to the collapse of the Abe Cabinet. The new cabinet will constantly exert its utmost efforts to implement wartime fiscal policies and stabilize the lives of the people. Therefore, it will exercise particularly careful judgement regarding the selection of so-called economic cabinet ministers, such as the Finance Minister, the Minister of Commerce and Industry, and the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry.

### Soviet Union Lodges Serious Protest Against Anti-Soviet Movements in Sweden and Norway; Accuses the Two Countries of Violating Neutrality Policy with Anti-Soviet Attitudes; Sufficient to Cause Unfavorable Disputes and Disrupt Normal Relations; The Two Countries' Replies Deny Accusations

Moscow - The Soviet government has recently taken note of the facts displayed by Norway and Sweden. News agencies and certain officials closely related to the two governments have begun a large-scale anti-Soviet movement with the assistance of the authorities in the two countries and have taken actions that violate the neutrality policy of the two governments. Regarding these facts, the Soviet government has authorized its ambassadors to Norway and Sweden to lodge protests with the governments of the two countries. On January 5th, Soviet Ambassador to Sweden, Krountai, representing the Soviet government, sent a document to Swedish Foreign Minister Günther. The document stated, "In December, anti-Soviet newspapers and other parties, under the leadership of the 'Social Democratic Newspaper,' which has close ties with the government, began an inappropriate anti-Soviet movement. Unless Sweden and the Soviet Union were at war or Sweden was prepared to wage war against the Soviet Union, this movement could not be allowed to exist."

At the same time, Swedish newspapers have directly appealed to the people to fight against the Soviet Union and have demanded that Sweden assist the "Tanner" and "Ryti" governments with force in their war against the Soviet Union. The Swedish government has not stopped this movement, which is sufficient to cause disputes between the two countries. What is even more serious is that some officials have openly participated in organizations that assist the Tanner and Ryti governments with force. As of December 7th, there were 47 recruiting offices in Swedish cities under the protection of the Swedish authorities, and tens of thousands of "volunteers" have been recruited. According to reports, as of December 8th, 10,000 "volunteers" had arrived in Finland from Sweden. Reports then stated that two teams of "volunteers" had left central and southern Sweden for Finland and were commanded by Swedish General Linder. Swedish newspapers have both called for military action against the Soviet Union and, with the assistance of the Swedish authorities, have openly demanded the organization of "volunteer armies." In addition, they have directly supplied the Tanner and Ryti governments with arms and ammunition and have allowed arms and ammunition to be transported to Finland through Sweden. Regarding the above facts and the anti-Soviet actions of the Swedish authorities, the Soviet government solemnly requests the Swedish government to take note. The Soviet government believes that this action by the Swedish authorities not only violates Sweden's neutrality policy but will also cause unfavorable disputes in relations between the two countries.

Also on the same day (January 5th), Soviet Ambassador to Norway, Plothnikov, also representing the Soviet government, delivered a document to Norwegian Foreign Minister Koht, stating, "Recently, certain Norwegian parties and Norwegian newspapers with close ties to the government have conducted an unrestrained anti-Soviet movement. This movement will inevitably cause disputes in relations between the Soviet Union and Norway." Norwegian newspapers, in addition to directly appealing to fight against the Soviet Union, have also demanded that military force be used to assist the Tanner and Ryti governments in their war against the Soviet Union. Some officials, such as Halbach, have even participated in this movement. At the same time, recruitment committees have been established throughout Norway to incite war against the Soviet Union. It is reported that the "Oslo" group is organizing a division of "volunteers" to go to Finland. In addition, under the protection of the Norwegian authorities, Norway has supplied Finland with arms and ammunition, and various military materials have been transported to Finland through Norway. Regarding the above facts and the anti-Soviet actions of the Norwegian authorities, the Soviet government specifically requests the Norwegian government to pay close attention. At the same time, the Soviet government believes that it must solemnly state to the Norwegian government that the actions of the Norwegian authorities not only violate Norway's neutrality policy but are also bound to cause unfavorable disputes, further damaging the normal relations between the two countries. (TASS, 15th)

Stockholm, Sweden - Swedish newspapers have reprinted the exchange of notes between the Swedish and Soviet governments and solemnly declared that the Soviet government did not notify the Swedish government before publishing this exchange of notes, which is contrary to diplomatic customs. (Haitong, 15th)

Norwegian Government's Reply

Moscow - On January 6th, Norwegian Foreign Minister Koht delivered a reply to Soviet Ambassador Plothnikov, responding to the Soviet protest. In the reply, the Norwegian government pointed out that the Soviet claim that Norway had violated its neutrality policy was based on inaccurate reports. The anti-Soviet records in Norwegian newspapers were purely individual actions and had not received the support of responsible authorities. The Norwegian government had not assisted the recruitment committees established throughout Norway. Since the recruitment of soldiers for foreign countries is contrary to Norwegian law, the Norwegian authorities would not allow it to proceed. For the same reason, the Norwegian authorities had not assisted in the transport of arms and ammunition to Finland. The Norwegian government believes that if individuals voluntarily go abroad to participate in war, it does not violate neutrality. Therefore, the import of arms and ammunition into other countries through Norway cannot be viewed as a violation of international law. However, to the best of the Norwegian government's knowledge, there are no arms and ammunition being transported to Finland through Norway. Even private arms exports are extremely limited. Regarding its neutrality policy, the Norwegian government has always maintained it and will continue to maintain it. Norway sincerely hopes that the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Norway will continue uninterrupted. (TASS, 15th)

Swedish Government's Reply

Moscow - On January 10th, Swedish Foreign Minister Günther replied to the Soviet protest. In the reply, the Swedish government pointed out that the Swedish people sympathize with Finland. Therefore, newspapers cannot avoid having the same tone. However, the Swedish constitution prohibits newspapers from abusing the right to freedom of speech, and especially opposes newspapers insulting foreign representatives and powers. The Swedish government believes that neither in newspapers nor in other aspects has it given the Soviet Union a reason to criticize Sweden. The Soviet accusations are based on inaccurate reports, especially regarding the recruitment of volunteers, which is absolutely not in accordance with the facts. The Swedish recruitment of volunteers is purely an individual action, and the numbers are different from those pointed out by the Soviet government. In short, the Swedish authorities have not assisted in the recruitment of volunteers. Even officers of the Swedish army have not gone to Finland to participate in the war. As for military supplies transported from Sweden or through Sweden to Finland, there is no reason to oppose this action. Sweden strives to maintain trade relations with all countries. Finland can obtain imports from Sweden, and Finland can also obtain goods it needs through Sweden. The Swedish government believes that there is no need to change this situation and hinder the development of trade between Sweden and Finland. The Swedish government believes that the above statement will dispel Soviet misunderstandings and prove to the Soviet authorities that the Soviet authorities have no reason to blame Sweden. Sweden has not adopted an aggressive policy toward the Soviet Union and is willing to remove all misunderstandings between the two countries. (Reuters, 15th)

Soviet Union Expresses Dissatisfaction

Moscow - The Soviet government cannot consider the replies of Norway, especially Sweden, to the Soviet protest to be satisfactory. The Norwegian and Swedish governments have not completely denied the violations of neutrality policy. This attitude of the Norwegian and Swedish governments is dangerous. Some strong powers are attempting to drag Norway and Sweden into the war. The current attitude of the Norwegian and Swedish governments proves that they are not good at resisting the invasive forces of these strong powers. (TASS, 15th)

### Italy Changes Attitude Towards the Soviet Union, Observations in British Political Circles

London - Political figures here have commented on the relations between Italy and the Soviet Union, saying that the Italian government has changed its attitude towards the Soviet Union. Several weeks ago, Italy stood as a pillar of anti-Bolshevism in southeastern Europe, and newspapers across the country unanimously declared that this attitude would be maintained to the end, regardless of the consequences. Until recently, the tone of the newspapers has changed. This situation occurred at a time when Britain and France were stepping up their aid to Finland, which is worthy of attention. In Italy's view, Italy may only want to use ideological arguments to strengthen its position in Europe, and has no intention of resisting the Soviet Union's intrusion into the Balkan Peninsula. If Germany expands its power in the Balkan Peninsula in conjunction with the Soviet Union, it can be even more certain that Italy no longer opposes Germany's solid position in Central and Eastern Europe. In the future, Germany may obtain Italian support and re-adopt a "peace offensive" under more favorable conditions. It is not impossible. (Havas, 14th)

### Soviet Industrial Production Sees Significant Increase

Moscow - The Soviet Union's National Economic Bureau announced today statistics confirming that the Soviet Union's industrial production in 1939 saw a significant increase compared to 1938. Heavy industry increased by 13 percent, and light industry increased by 15 percent. Among them, the increase in production related to aviation, military supplies, armaments, and shipbuilding was the largest, reaching 9 percent. Gasoline increased by 8 percent, metallurgy (excluding iron) increased by 14 percent, and chemical manufactures increased by 12 percent. (Haitong, 15th)

### Southern Regent Liaison with the Croats, Croatian Council, Electoral Law Signed

Yugoslavian Capital - Prince Paul, Regent of Yugoslavia, completed the signing of the electoral law for the Croatian Council at the Zagreb Palace. This was announced by the State Councilor, namely Croatian leader Maček. Residents were overjoyed upon hearing the news. After reviewing the Croatian militia, Prince Paul delivered a short speech, emphasizing that Yugoslavia had achieved unification at great sacrifice. Today, it has further overcome the most severe difficulties. He continued, "The purpose of Yugoslavia's policy can be summed up in one sentence: 'To maintain peace internally and externally.'" In the evening, Croatian chief Dr. Šutej hosted a banquet to welcome Regent Prince Paul and Princess Olga. (Reuters, 15th)

### Hungary Denies Plotting Against the Soviet Union

Moscow - Hungarian Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Kirisztu, yesterday visited Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Vice Chairman Bodan Kin, making the following statement: "Recently, there have been many rumors regarding the memories of the Hungarian Foreign Minister and the Italian Foreign Minister Ciano in Vienna. It is said that the purpose of this Hungarian-Italian meeting was to deal with the Soviet Union. The Hungarian government believes it is necessary to deny these rumors and declare that the so-called organization of a certain group was not discussed at the Vienna meeting." The Hungarian Ambassador requested that Bodan Kin relay the above statement to the Soviet government. (TASS, 15th)

### Unprecedented Fire in Shizuoka City, Japan, Burning Over Three Thousand Homes

Tokyo - Regarding the great fire in Shizuoka, the city's telephone bureau received information at 3 p.m. today stating that although the fire near Shin-Tomicho, where the fire originated, had been temporarily extinguished, the flames had spread to Shichikencho on the city's main street. Fanned by strong winds of 11 meters per second, it spread further to various streets. Almost all of the southwestern main street of the city was burned down. The number of houses affected reached 1,000. The Imperial Villa, the Prefectural Office, and the Shizuoka Post Office, etc., in the government office district, are currently safe because the wind direction is opposite. However, Shizuoka Station is in danger. Therefore, both the up and down lines of the Tokaido Line are closed. Citizens are evacuating from the Chojamachi drill ground towards the Abe River. (Domei News Agency, 15th)

Shizuoka - At approximately 11:10 a.m. on the 15th, a fire broke out in Shin-Tomicho 1-chome, Shizuoka City, affecting 14 or 15 locations throughout the city. At present (2:30 p.m.), black smoke is soaring throughout the city. Although firefighters from nearby towns and villages such as Yaizu and Shimizu have arrived to try to put out the fire, it is difficult to extinguish due to strong westerly winds. Currently, 400 or 500 homes have been burned down. (Domei News Agency, 15th)

Nagoya - The Nagoya Railway Bureau, in order to rescue Shizuoka City from the great fire, dispatched relief trains full of rice, coal, and other relief materials and railway sleepers at 5:30 p.m. and 8:00 p.m., respectively, rushing to the scene of the incident. On the other hand, the 3rd Division authorities also sent Staff Officer Captain Suzuki, on the train departing from Nagoya at 7:23 p.m., rushing to the local area, ordering the Toyohashi unit to dispatch troops and provide relief according to the situation. (Domei News Agency, 15th)

Hamamatsu - The great fire in Shizuoka City is still raging. As of 6:00 p.m., the number of residences destroyed by fire has reached more than 3,000, including the following important buildings: Municipal Girls' Commercial School, Sanbancho Elementary School, Shizuoka Station, Transportation Workers' Union, Suruga Bank branch, Yasuda Savings Bank branch, Matsuzakaya Department Store, Kabuki-za Theater, Denki-kan (Cinema), Daito-kan, and Fugetsu-ro Restaurant.

### Concentration of Dutch and Belgian Troops on the Border: Strict Vigilance Against German Invasion of Neutrality; Dutch Government Orders Cancellation of Military Leave; Belgium Establishes Command Headquarters and Evacuates Border Population

London: The British War Office announced last night that due to widespread rumors in Europe of German plans to invade Belgium and the Netherlands, the leave of the British Expeditionary Force has been temporarily canceled. Although there have been no recent reports of German troop movements along the Belgian-Dutch border, the German plan to attack Belgium and the Netherlands is widely rumored among several European capitals. According to a Greek newspaper report yesterday, an unconfirmed Berlin dispatch claimed that Allied forces are "preparing to take defensive action on the Western Front." (Fifteenth, United Press dispatch)

Paris: Diplomatic circles here are paying close attention to the security measures taken by the Belgian and Dutch governments. However, they say that there is no reliable information to confirm whether Germany has decided to attack these countries. In particular, the army of that country had already prepared to advance into the Netherlands as early as last November. Subsequently, because the Belgian government decided to come to the aid of the Netherlands in the event of an invasion, the German government temporarily abandoned its plans. As of now, its state of military preparedness is no different from two months ago. It can launch an offensive at any time with just an order. Moreover, in reality, the repeated overflights of Belgian airspace by German aircraft, the arrival of that country's high-speed motorized units on the Dutch border, and the alarmist pronouncements in that country's newspapers all sufficiently prove that the increased preventive measures taken by the Belgian and Dutch governments are fully justified. After the freezing of the Dutch canals, the plan to flood them is difficult to implement. The German military authorities see this as an opportunity and may implement the invasion plan decided last November anew. Another theory is that the German government's deployment of troops on the Belgian and Dutch borders is actually intended to divert attention in order to launch a feint to the west and attack to the east, and take action in Central Europe. In addition, it is reported that the German transportation authorities have been ordered to repair all roads to ensure that tanks and military trucks can travel smoothly. At the same time, the military authorities of that country have also taken various military measures at the junction of the Slovak state and Hungary, and the garrison troops in the protectorates of Bohemia and Moravia have also been ordered to move to the Swiss border. (Fourteenth, Havas dispatch)

Swiss Capital: Foreign radio stations have broadcast messages claiming that Germany has concentrated troops along the Swiss border. The Swiss General Staff has denied this. (Fourteenth, Havas News Agency dispatch)

Paris: Regarding the German threat to Belgium and the Netherlands, most newspapers here believe that although that country may launch a sudden offensive, it is unlikely to take immediate action given the current situation. Le Petit Parisien reported that regardless of what Germany decides, Britain, France, and the neutral countries are all prepared. L'Ordre reported that, as it is winter, Germany could gain an advantage by invading the Netherlands at this time. However, we cannot help but feel that if Hitler is counting on the Soviet Union to provide supplies, he must remain inactive to prolong the war. Conversely, if Germany takes offensive action on the Western Front or attacks Belgium and the Netherlands, it proves that that country no longer has faith in future Soviet supplies. (Fifteenth, Havas dispatch)

Belgian Establishes General Headquarters

Brussels: Over the past few days, there have been widespread rumors of German plans to invade Belgium and the Netherlands. People living in villages along the Belgian border are being evacuated to other places. Neutral military observers estimate that Belgium has 700,000 soldiers. Yesterday, the Belgian General Staff took over the official announcement of military operations from the Ministry of National Defense. (Fifteenth, United Press dispatch)

Brussels: The implementation of Belgium's mobilization order has now reached the stage of establishing a general headquarters, only one step away from the final stage of general mobilization. The general headquarters will issue orders from now on and take over the duties formerly under the Ministry of National Defense. Cafés in Brussels closed from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM today and will close again after 9:00 PM. Although the atmosphere is not particularly tense, life is somewhat as usual. Today is Sunday, and the streets are still crowded with pedestrians. Movie theaters and cafés are still full of customers. (Fifteenth, Reuters dispatch)

Brussels: The general impression from well-informed sources is that no serious incidents have occurred so far, and it is believed that the situation has eased slightly. Political figures believe that the German measures are purely empty threats, the purpose of which is to ascertain the extent of Belgium's preparedness to resist a possible invasion. It is heard that Belgium has concentrated six divisions in several locations, especially in the Aix-la-Chapelle area, to counter a possible concentration of German troops. (Fifteenth, Reuters dispatch)

Brussels: After the government authorities took military precautions, well-informed people here said that the Belgian military and civilians are prepared to deal with any eventuality. Anyone who dares to invade will be met with a head-on blow, as the German army encountered in 1914. However, the general public believes that the current situation has eased and that this sudden threat may disappear. It is still unknown why the government authorities suddenly strengthened their defenses. What can be said at this point is that after German newspapers fiercely attacked the neutral countries last week, their aircraft repeatedly flew over Belgian airspace and mobilized troops near the Belgian and Dutch borders. (Fifteenth, Havas News Agency dispatch)

Brussels: After Germany concentrated troops in the Belgian border area, the Belgian government ordered that all leave for army officers and soldiers be canceled, and those on leave were recalled. At the same time, the "D-Day" mobilization plan was implemented, and the residents of the three districts of Liège, Bébense, and Verviers (the German army invaded Belgium through these three districts during the previous European war) who lived near key military points were evacuated and transported by bus to central Belgium. In addition, most of the people who had previously engaged in anti-National Socialist propaganda activities in the districts of Eupen and Malmedy (formerly part of Germany before the last European war) were also ordered by the Belgian government to return to the interior. Reporters stationed in the eastern border area have also been ordered by the government to report cautiously on the various military measures there. (Fourteenth, Havas dispatch)

Brussels: Last night, the newspapers here tried their best to calm the panic among the people caused by the government's military measures. The newspapers unanimously and solemnly declared that there was no imminent crisis in Belgium, that street rumors should not be trusted, and that people should maintain a calm attitude and wait for further developments in the situation. The military measures taken by the government are motivated by the desire to strengthen border defenses, not to prepare for new events. The public should not listen to rumors and should absolutely trust the government and be aware of their responsibilities. (Fifteenth, Haitong News Agency dispatch)

Dutch Cabinet Convened an Emergency Meeting

The Hague: The Dutch cabinet convened a special emergency meeting last night to discuss the international situation caused by rumors of German plans to invade the Netherlands and Belgium. After the cabinet meeting, an official announcement was issued, saying, "Indications of an international nature have led the government to decide not to grant leave to the military." At this time, all soldiers on leave were immediately recalled to duty. The emergency order issued yesterday is similar to those issued by Belgium on Friday and Saturday. According to unconfirmed reports, German troops are concentrating other units on the southeastern border of the Netherlands. These units include rapidly moving mobile units. Dutch soldiers plan to strengthen defenses there to cope with the situation. (Fifteenth, United Press dispatch)

Amsterdam: According to news from here tonight, the temporary suspension of leave for the Dutch army does not mean that soldiers already on leave must return to duty immediately. It only means that those currently on duty are not allowed to take leave. This morning, many soldiers who were already on leave mistakenly believed that they had to return to camp immediately and canceled their appointments during their leave. It is also heard that soldiers who are merchants on leave to manage their business, or who work in the military industry on leave, are not affected by this order. However, the Netherlands is now "militarily prepared" to deal with any developments. Over the past week, the Netherlands has experienced severe cold, with thick ice forming. Soldiers and cars can travel on the ice, but heavy mechanized transport teams or tanks cannot. Last night, the temperature was warmer, and today the ice and snow are gradually melting. Large blocks of ice in the river are now breaking up. The general situation makes it difficult for large-scale invading troops to move. (Fourteenth, Reuters dispatch)

The Hague: Over the past two days, political figures here have been quite alarmed, but they began to calm down this morning. Well-informed sources say that the Belgian government has been in close contact with the Dutch side and is currently taking a more optimistic attitude towards the international situation. (Fifteenth, Haitong News Agency dispatch)

German Engineers Concentrated on the Dutch Border

Paris: According to news from the German border, engineering units of that country have been concentrated in various places near the Dutch border, especially in Bocholt, Burlo, and Wesel. At the same time, special units have also arrived in these places, carrying many small motorboats that can carry three or four soldiers. Among them are also larger ones that can accommodate two motorcycles, four soldiers, and two machine guns. In addition, there are also reports of troop movements in many places in Germany. A large number of aircraft are concentrated at the junction of the Belgian, Dutch, and German borders. (Fourteenth, Havas dispatch)

### British Expeditionary Force Officers and Soldiers Temporarily Suspend Leave

London: The British War Office announced today that the leave of soldiers in the British Expeditionary Force has been temporarily suspended. (Fifteenth, Reuters dispatch)

London: After the regular leave of officers and soldiers of the British Expeditionary Force was temporarily canceled, those in charge here refused to comment, but private individuals believed that the governments of Belgium and the Netherlands had been taking various military precautions in recent days. The British government's actions are intended to express "sympathy" and show concern to those countries, and it is said that this measure was decided by the Expeditionary Force authorities yesterday afternoon. (Fifteenth, Havas dispatch)

Paris: A communiqué was issued here stating, "Nothing of note to report on the Western Front today." (Fourteenth, Reuters dispatch)

Berlin: The message released by British radio stations, saying that British aircraft recently flew over German airspace, reaching the southeastern and Plessburg airspace of that country, and did not encounter fire from German aircraft and anti-aircraft guns, will make people around the world question Germany's air defense construction. But what can reassure people around the world is that the German people are not asleep. Not only have British aircraft never invaded German airspace, but Germany has air defense surveillance posts in Vienna and Prague, reporting the movement of enemy aircraft at any time. Therefore, it is impossible for British aircraft to invade German territory at night or at the highest altitude. Moreover, aircraft flying into enemy countries at the highest altitude at night have little military value and benefit. Conversely, German aircraft often fly to Britain and France during the day for reconnaissance, which can achieve greater military results. (Fifteenth, Haitong News Agency dispatch)

### Ships in Distress on European and American Seas: Norwegian Merchant Ship Strikes a Mine; Two British Ships Sink

Oslo: The Norwegian merchant ship Flovier (1,250 tons) sank after striking a mine in the North Sea yesterday. Five crew members were rescued, and the remaining eleven are missing and feared dead. (Fifteenth, Reuters dispatch)

Amsterdam: The British 4,575-ton ship "Scott" sank off the coast of France yesterday. According to news from London, the ship ran aground there. All crew members jumped into lifeboats and have now safely landed. (Fifteenth, Haitong News Agency dispatch)

Amsterdam: The British steamer "Helford" (409 tons) collided with the British ship "Moor" (1,761 tons) near Vlissingen yesterday. The "Helford" was wrecked and sank. The crew was rescued by the "Moor." (Fifteenth, Haitong News Agency dispatch)

Mexico: News from Veracruz says that two ships collided near Cabeche yesterday, killing ten passengers, including two women and several children. It is believed that the number of drownings is still small, but there are many injuries, including five serious injuries, who have now been rescued. (Fifteenth, Haitong News Agency dispatch)

### Soviet Aircraft Continue Bombing: Finland Suffers Heavy Losses; Finnish Aircraft Also Sortie to Bomb Soviet Warships; Only Minor Contact Between the Two Armies on the Front Lines

Helsinki: Nine Soviet bombers flew over Helsinki yesterday at a low altitude of about 4,000 feet. Before dropping bombs, they dropped even lower to 1,000 feet. Almost all the artillery pieces erected in the city opened fire. The bombs fell near the working-class district, with little damage. Two Finnish fighter planes took off, chasing one Soviet plane overseas and two Soviet planes west. The Finnish fighter planes appeared to be new-style aircraft with very high speeds. Looking up at the street, the burst of their machine-gun fire was quite clear. (Fifteenth, Reuters dispatch)

Helsinki: Soviet air force activity was unusually high in southern Finland yesterday. Hanko and Ekenäs were bombed as many as five times. Large fires raged, and traffic was cut off. The extent of the damage is extremely serious. It is understood that southern Finland has become the focus of bombing. (Fifteenth, Haitong News Agency dispatch)

Helsinki: As a result of the repeated air raids by Soviet aircraft last weekend, the greatest loss was in the Vasa area, which was bombed five times, with as many as 90 bombs dropped. The Soviet side seems determined to render this important port useless. Some civilians were killed and injured, and large fires broke out in several places. (Fifteenth, Reuters dispatch)

Helsinki: Government authorities announced that Soviet aircraft bombed the capital and Lathi yesterday, killing 14 people and injuring hundreds. However, we shot down two Soviet aircraft and discovered a Soviet heavy bomber, its fuselage completely destroyed, which was likely shot down a few days ago. In addition, Finnish aircraft were also very active yesterday, flying to a certain sea area and bombing Soviet warships. (Fourteenth, Havas dispatch)

Moscow: The headquarters of the Leningrad Military District issued a communiqué saying that on the fourteenth, reconnaissance teams were active in the Murmansk, Ukhtai, and Ripola areas. At the same time, there was also minor but intense artillery fire in several districts. In the Peterzavodsk area, infantry continued to clash. As for the Karelian Isthmus, there was an artillery battle on both sides, but it was not very fierce. At the same time, there was also contact between sentries on both sides. Soviet aircraft conducted reconnaissance flights. (Fifteenth, TASS News Agency dispatch)

Helsinki: The General Staff issued a war report stating: (1) Enemy artillery and patrol units were quite active on all fronts today. The Red Army launched an attack on our army's positions on the Eastern Front, but was repelled. The outpost units of the father and son sides repeatedly engaged in encounters. The Red Army suffered heavy casualties and abandoned a large number of military supplies. (2) Soviet aircraft flew to the cities of Kumo, Abo, and Sobele yesterday for bombing. (Fourteenth, Havas dispatch)

Swedish Capital: Professor Kiveths, the head of the Danish ambulance team, recently telegraphed from Finland that the team was bombed by Soviet aircraft, but fortunately there was no damage. (Fourteenth, Havas dispatch)

### Soviet Aircraft Bomb Swedish Ice, Dropping Bombs; Sweden Will Protest to the Soviet Union

Swedish Capital: The Foreign Ministry announced that several aircraft of unknown nationality flew over Swedish airspace yesterday. Foreign aircraft also flew over the islands between Haparanda and Luleå. However, due to heavy rain, it was impossible to identify their nationality. It is heard that eight foreign aircraft flying very high flew north over Arvidsjaur. According to details from Luleå, foreign aircraft dropped at least nine bombs in the area, but there was no damage. Several bombs also fell in Galas, six miles southwest of Luleå, exploding on the ice. Officials are currently investigating to determine the source of the bombs. (Fifteenth, Reuters dispatch)

Swedish Capital: According to newspaper reports, many bombs were dropped near the port of Luleå in northern Sweden yesterday. It has been proven that they were bombs from Soviet aircraft. The bombs were dropped near a small Swedish island yesterday afternoon. Eight of them landed on the ice around the island, and one landed on the island. According to political figures, the Swedish government will protest to the Soviet government regarding the intrusion of Soviet aircraft into Swedish territory.

### Political Conspiracy Cracked in New York: Called the Christian Front

New York: Today, according to FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, 18 members of an organization called the Christian Front have been arrested for conspiring to incite a revolution in the United States, overthrow the government, and establish a dictatorship. A small-scale arsenal was seized in New York City, which was said to have been intended for use in the revolution by the Christian Front. The arrested people were all using the operation of sports clubs as a disguise, planning to start using terrorist means to eliminate all Jews from January 20, seize various public utilities, and plan to bomb the "Forward" newspaper office, seize the New York Customs, various Federal Reserve Banks, and the National Guard. Hoover continued, the leader of the organization, Cassel, was also among those arrested, and his followers all called him the leader. Federal detectives, after several searches, seized bombs, rifles, and thousands of rounds of ammunition. It is heard that this conspiracy has been going on for at least seven months. The authorities are now continuing their investigation to seize the Christian Front's hidden weapons elsewhere. According to Hoover, he announced this conspiracy at the request of Attorney General Murphy. Those involved had been meeting in the homes of various party members, at least one of whom was a member of the German-American Bund. There are also many party members who are related to the American Reserve. It is heard that among those arrested, seven people have Irish surnames. The Christian Front has thousands of members, but its exact number cannot be announced until the full Taoist investigation is completed. Hoover also stated that a thorough investigation is underway. (Fifteenth, Reuters dispatch)

According to an investigation by federal authorities, Schluter was recently working as a caterer on the sunken German ship Columbus. There are a total of four of Schluter's accomplices currently imprisoned in the United States.

### Britain Recruits a Large Number of Air Force Personnel in Australia

Sydney: It is now known here that in order to realize the British Empire Air Force Plan, Australia will begin large-scale recruitment at the beginning of this year to recruit tens of thousands of Australian Air Force personnel. In addition to the 26,000 flight personnel needed, dozens of technicians are also needed to undertake ground work. Almost all Australian machinists will be absorbed, and the Australian government will also appeal to Australian aviation experts to assist in making up for the inadequacy of the training team provided by Britain. According to the British Empire Air Force Plan, Australia will need more than 2,000 new aircraft to train air force personnel. It is expected that large-scale training will begin in March, and a special department for handling training will be established as soon as possible. This plan is presided over by the Australian Aviation Bureau. Although the Australian government has decided to establish 34 new aviation schools as soon as possible, it is expected that several new schools cannot be completed in a few months. Once senior training is completed, pilots will join the British Air Force for service. At the same time, thousands of people trained by the Canadian Air Force will also go to Britain for service.

### Results of Japan's Budget Expansion: Inflation Inevitable; Banknote Circulation Far Exceeds Limit

Tokyo—The Japanese government authorities, having endeavored to limit banknote issuance over the past several months, have recently announced officially that the total amount of banknotes in circulation nationwide reached a staggering 3,817,752,000 yen by the end of last year. This surge in currency, while partly attributed to year-end settlements in various sectors, is expected to gradually decrease after the New Year. However, it has already drawn serious attention from the authorities.

The Governor of the Bank of Japan, Toyotaro Kageyama, in his New Year's address, reviewed the state of Japanese finance and frankly warned the government and the people that "the red signal of inflation" had already been triggered. Financial circles indicate that the banknote circulation at the end of last year increased by approximately 1 billion yen compared to the end of the previous year. The government's measures to prevent excessive banknote issuance over the past year have not been particularly effective.

According to the Bank of Japan Act, the bank may issue banknotes backed by coins, gold bullion, silver bars, government bonds, and other reliable commercial paper. However, the total amount is subject to limitations. This limit has been relaxed repeatedly, most recently to 2.7 billion yen. Although the bank, with the consent of the Minister of Finance, may exceed the legal limit, it is required to pay a special tax of 3% on the excess amount to the government.

In practice, the 2.7 billion yen limit was set in October last year, but by then the amount of banknotes in circulation had already exceeded the limit. Therefore, the special tax collection measure had already been implemented. However, the trend of increasing banknote issuance has not been curbed as a result, and the circulation amount has now exceeded the limit by more than 1.1 billion yen. Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan's gold reserves are only 500 million yen.

Looking at the state of Japanese currency over the past two and a half years, during the first ten months of the Sino-Japanese War, the bank's banknote issuance was only 100 million yen, which was in line with the legal limit at the time—less than half of the current legal limit. The circulation amount was also less than one-third of the current amount. By April of the previous year, Japan was beginning to feel the impact of the war on its currency, and the bank abruptly raised the issuance limit to 1.7 billion yen. Unexpectedly, four months later, the amount of banknotes in circulation had already increased to 2 billion yen. The Japanese government, left with no choice, again raised the legal limit to 2.2 billion yen in November of the previous year. However, by December of that year, the circulation amount had increased to 2.858 billion yen, breaking the record of 2.659 billion yen from the financial panic of 1927.

In July of last year, the banknote issuance amount decreased briefly, but only temporarily. The government then raised the legal limit to 2.7 billion yen in October. Financial authorities felt that they could at best mitigate the trend of increasing banknote issuance, but could not stop it. This situation has deep-rooted causes that cannot be reversed by government restrictions.

Overly optimistic newspapers in Japan often claim that "economic recovery" is the main reason for the increased currency issuance. They cite various other reasons to justify the current situation, such as the increase in wartime pensions, the surge in demand for funds among silk merchants after the soaring silk prices, the new rice crop entering the market, the growing trend of individuals using cash transactions instead of checks, the rise in prices and wages, and the failure of funds flowing into rural areas to return to urban areas.

However, according to Japanese financial circles, all these reasons are merely different facets of one major factor: the excessively large national budget, which has exceeded 10 billion yen. The state of Japanese banknote circulation is like a lake, with its water level determined by the flow of two rivers. One river pours banknotes into the lake, and the other drains banknotes out of the lake. The former represents the huge expenditures caused by the war in China and the various expenses used to increase production and strengthen military equipment. The latter represents the sources of funds for these expenditures—raising taxes to return a portion of the banknotes in the hands of the people to the national treasury, in other words, withdrawing a portion of the banknotes circulating in the market. This is one method of government fundraising. Requiring banks to subscribe to government bonds to absorb a portion of the funds from all public or semi-public reserves is a second method of fundraising. Therefore, the government can recover a portion of the banknotes from the banks, while the banks, encouraged by the government, transfer the government bonds they have subscribed to private individuals and private industrial and commercial organizations.

In normal times, the interaction of these two rivers can often maintain a relatively stable water level in the lake. However, since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the "inflowing river" has become increasingly rapid, leading to a daily increase in banknote issuance, while the "outflowing river" has been extremely slow, reducing the rate at which banknotes flow back from the market to the national treasury. In response to this situation, the government cannot raise tax rates indefinitely, so it can only rely on government bonds to fund the war effort. However, the market is already saturated with previously issued government bonds, and the banks find it increasingly difficult to transfer government bonds to the public. Therefore, even if the government issues new government bonds, the subscription amount is minimal, and these government bonds remain mostly stored in the vaults of banks or organizations. The currency circulating in the market remains banknotes. As a result, the amount of banknotes in circulation will inevitably rise gradually, just as the water level in a lake rises when more water flows in than flows out. The inevitable consequence of this phenomenon is a rise in prices, and the rise in prices then leads to an increase in the amount of banknotes in circulation. This cycle of cause and effect makes inflation inevitable. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 15th)

After entrusting the Shanghai Rice Dealers' Association to handle the rice price stabilization sales, the Rice Dealers' Association designated 100 members to handle the sales and expedited all procedures. Originally scheduled to begin on January 18, the start date was postponed to January 21 (Sunday) after consultation between the Chairman of the Rice Dealers' Association, Zhang Nianxuan, and the Director of the Rice Price Stabilization Committee, Chu Qiqing, due to insufficient time to complete the procedures.

Rice Industry Association Disciplinary Meeting

Ren Da Shun, Sun Meng Ji, and Zhi He are suspected of exceeding price limits in their rice transactions; Qin Yi is suspected of intending to raise prices beyond the limits. The Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association held a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees on the 12th of this month and decided that Ren Da Shun was indeed suspected of exceeding price limits and should be fined 100 yuan in accordance with the resolution of the joint meeting of rice industry organizations on May 5, 1928. Regarding Sun Meng Ji and Zhi He, a joint meeting of rice industry organizations should be convened to handle the matter. Regarding Qin Yi, its intention to raise prices beyond the limits is suspected of disrupting the market. In addition to being sent to court by the police, the association should impose a suspension of business for two months. For the sake of prudence, the association convened a joint meeting of seven rice industry organizations at 3 PM yesterday at 15 Avenue Edward VII. A total of 16 representatives, including Chen Ziyi, Xing Zhigang, Zhang Nianxuan, and Fu Qian Geng, attended. Chairman Xing Zhigang presided over the meeting, which resolved to fine Ren Da Shun, Sun Meng Ji, and Zhi He 100 yuan each in accordance with the resolution of the joint meeting of rice industry organizations on May 5 of the previous year, with 30% of the fines going to the whistleblower and 70% allocated to charity expenses. A public announcement was made to the market as a warning. The meeting adjourned at 6 PM.

Charity Bread Distribution Already Difficult

Since the Shanghai Charity Organizations Joint Association began distributing bread and soup in the evenings to relieve the poor and hungry, it has provided great benefits. However, the number of people has been increasing daily. Despite the increase in the quantity of bread, there are still crowds and insufficient distribution each time. The amount of flour has been increased to 20-30 bags each time, but it is still not enough. If this continues, it will be difficult to sustain the effort. Those involved in charitable work are deeply concerned that the good deed may not be completed, which is also a source of heartache for members of charity organizations. Therefore, while the evening distribution of bread continues as usual, the handling of the matter has become difficult. If there is no financial support, there will eventually be a day when it is suspended halfway. Therefore, there is an urgent need for donations. Regarding the order at the New Great World Road charity distribution site, the Charity Joint Association has specially stipulated that women and children will be given priority for steamed buns, and then other poor people will be given them after the women and children are finished. This can reduce congestion and show compassion for the weak.

Relief for the Underprivileged Temporarily Suspended

Relief for the underprivileged is originally a good deed, but there are too many people waiting for assistance. Requests for relief from the association have been overwhelming and far exceed the association's relief funds. Unless new donations are received, the current amount is a drop in the bucket for the underprivileged. Therefore, it is planned to temporarily suspend new requests and first complete the processing of existing requests. If there are future donations, relief efforts will continue, so that the underprivileged will not wait in vain.

### Spring Festival Military Appreciation Campaign; National Comforting Society Sends Telegrams to Various Parties to Advocate; Expanding Promotion Scheduled for February 10

The National Comforting Society sent a telegram saying: (Titles omitted) The Lunar New Year is approaching. During this time, there is a lot of unnecessary consumption in society. In view of this, our society is launching a nationwide Spring Festival Military Appreciation Campaign on February 10 (the second day of the Lunar New Year) to save unnecessary consumption, shift the target of gifts, and strengthen anti-Japanese sentiments. However, this matter is significant and requires collective effort to be effective. It is hoped that you will enthusiastically advocate and make efforts to achieve satisfactory results. The future of the war of resistance depends on it. The General Association of the National Committee for Comforting the Resistance Soldiers bows respectfully. It is heard that various sectors in our city greatly support this movement initiated by the Comforting Society. They are now gathering to discuss and promote methods and have scheduled February 10 for expanded promotion. It is hoped that all citizens of the city will rise up and contribute enthusiastically. All donations can be sent directly to the National Bank for collection and remittance.

### Bloodshed at the New Stage Last Night; Yu Yefeng Dies from Gunshot Wounds; Two Bullets in Vital Areas, Unable to Save; New Stage Employee Zhang Xuebing Also Injured

At 8:45 PM last night, the regular evening drama began on the upper floor of the New Stage on Niuzhuang Road in the Public Concession. As patrons of the opera flocked to the scene, a shooting occurred. The victim was Yu Yefeng from Zhejiang, who was shot twice. He died from his injuries at Renji Hospital. A stray bullet injured Zhang Xuebing, a local employee. Details are as follows:

Avid Drama Enthusiast Residing in Shanghai

Yu Yefeng was from Hangzhou, 61 years old. In the early years of the Republic, he served as the commander of the Jiaxing Water Police, but resigned shortly after and came to Shanghai as a retiree. He loved Peking opera, so he was friendly with famous performers from the north and south. He sometimes wrote entertainment articles to pass the time. Because he had lived in Shanghai for many years, he was well-known in various circles. In recent years, he invested in the Linji Lumber Company on Avenue Edward VII. He also served as the manager of the Great Wall Record Company. His friend, Wang Dazhang, is currently the manager of the New Stage. Because Yu loved Peking opera and the New Stage relied on Yu's help to hire famous performers from Beijing and Tianjin, he frequented the stage.

Gunshots Unheard While Enjoying Opera at the Stage

At around 8 PM last night, Yu Yefeng came to see the newly hired female Peking opera performer Xin Yanqiu from the New Stage. Opera fans gathered, and Yu went with delight. The scene outside was bustling. Just as the stage lights shone brightly and the gongs and drums resounded, the stage was performing the play "Snowy Night, Mistaken Journey to Xiaoshang River, Yang Zaixing's Return to Heaven" when gunshots suddenly rang out.

Yu Shot Twice in Vital Areas

Yu's seat was at the entrance of the manager's office on the second floor. At that time, he was focused on the stage when gunshots suddenly rang out from behind. The bullets were like a string of pearls. Yu was shot in the chest and left shoulder. Zhang Xuebing, a stage employee nearby, was also hit in the right leg by a stray bullet. The audience was initially unaware of what was happening until Yu and Zhang were shot and bleeding, causing a commotion. The stage management immediately reported to the police, who dispatched detectives to the scene and sent Yu and Zhang to Renji Hospital for treatment.

Unable to Save, Dies from Injuries

Yu was in his sixties and in poor health. After arriving at the hospital, despite emergency treatment, he fell into a coma because the bullets had hit vital areas. His concubine and Yu Yunjiu and others rushed to the hospital after hearing the news. Yu was unable to speak. He died at 9:55 PM. After reporting to the court for an examination, the body will be prepared for burial.

Audience Shocked, New Performer Stops Performing

After the incident, the opera-loving patrons had come with joy, originally intending to listen to the famous play "Hong Fu Zhuan" by the long-absent Xin Yanqiu. However, due to the sudden incident, the performance was stopped for precautionary reasons, causing the audience to return home disappointed. After arriving at the stage, the police detectives searched everywhere, but the assassin had already fled into the crowd.

Escaped Danger One Year Ago

Yu resided at 10 Yian Lane, 500 Avenue Albert, French Concession, and owned a car. He left behind a son named Yunjiu, who studied in Tokyo and is now the vice-principal of Hongyi Middle School on Gordon Road, Jing'an Temple Road. Yu Yunjiu was also present at the time of the incident. Yu was also present at the shooting at the New New Hotel, Room 407 on June 24, 1927, but luckily escaped unharmed. This time he was shot again, about a year and a half after the last incident.

### Warm Farewell from the Diplomatic Community; Fessenden Left Shanghai Yesterday; Inspected British Honor Guard at the Customs Wharf; British and French Consuls and Others Personally Went to Say Goodbye

Sir Fessenden, the British Consul-General in Shanghai, has completed his term in China and is retiring this year. He is scheduled to leave Shanghai on the President Coolidge of the American President Lines at 11:45 AM today, taking the route to England via the United States. The Consul-General's family will travel with him. All senior officials and associates of the British Consulate-General in Shanghai, as well as close friends and relatives, held a grand farewell party at the Jianghai Customs Wharf at 10:10 AM yesterday because the Consul-General would not return to Shanghai after returning to England.

To Console Departing Thoughts

Consuls from various countries in Shanghai, including the American Consul Gauss, the French Consul Bausset, the Japanese Consul Iura, the British military attaché Simmons, Rear Admiral Mohler of the US Fourth Marine Regiment, Sir George, the new British Consul-General in Shanghai, as well as Italian, Japanese, and military attachés and diplomatic personnel, along with Consul-General's friends, attended the farewell party. The Jianghai Customs Wharf and the Huangpu Bund were crowded with cars parked end to end. All the soldiers of the British Seaforth Highlanders were mobilized and formed a protective line along the Huangpu River. The police department also sent Chinese and Western detectives to patrol. The Consul-General expressed his deep gratitude to the diplomatic personnel and friends from various countries who came to see him off.

Deep Gratitude

The President Coolidge arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 5 PM on its return trip from Manila. It is scheduled to set sail at 11:45 AM today, taking the route to Kobe via Honolulu, Guam, and San Francisco to the United States. The Consul-General and his wife will stay in the United States for a while and then return to their hometown. After reporting for duty, they will retire. The British government may assign the Consul-General to a new position in London.

Warm Situation Recorded by Western Newspapers

The Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury stated that Sir Fessenden, the British Consul-General, has retired and left Shanghai this (15th) afternoon. Many senior British and other foreign diplomatic, military, and civilian officials went to the Customs Wharf to bid farewell. Sir Fessenden arrived at the Customs Wharf at around 12 noon, inspected the British honor guard, and then shook hands with the French Consul-General Bausset, the American Consul-General Gauss, and British diplomats to say goodbye before boarding a ferry of the American President Lines to transfer to the President Coolidge. Sir Fessenden has served in China for 42 years. The successor as the British Consul-General is Mr. George, who previously served as the Commercial Counsellor of the British Embassy. He also attended the farewell party this afternoon.

### Chen Gongbo and Others Going to Hong Kong; Rumor Proven Inaccurate

The Continental Daily News reported that rumors in the city recently stated that Chen Gongbo, Gao Zongwu, and Tao Xisheng disagreed with Wang Jingwei's political views and left for Hong Kong. A certain news agency strongly denied this information yesterday, calling it pure fabrication.

### Grand Departure of British Consul-General Fessenden from Shanghai

British Consul-General Fessenden retired and returned home yesterday. "Top photo" shows Fessenden saying goodbye to those seeing him off. "Bottom photo" shows the inspection of the British honor guard.

### Date of Yangzi River Opening; Foreign Merchants Closely Watch; All Prepare to Participate and Start Preparations; Rumor Says Opening Delayed to March 1

Regarding the opening of the Yangzi River, the Japanese have been promoting it for a long time, but it has not yet been implemented. All foreign shipping companies in the city intend to participate in preparation to recover their lost profits if the Japanese can sincerely open the Yangtze River, which has been blockaded for more than two years. Therefore, the shipping industry is closely watching this issue. Some foreign ships have begun all preparatory procedures and are constantly inquiring about the official opening date. According to sources in the shipping industry, the Japanese themselves have recently been actively working on navigation plans after the opening of the Yangtze River. Therefore, it is expected that the opening may be implemented, but the saying that the opening will occur on the date reported by the Japanese may not be accurate. It is expected that the opening will be postponed to March 1. Although outsiders have negotiated with the Japanese several times about the opening locations, the Japanese have always insisted on opening only to Nanjing.

### Approaching the Anniversary of the "January 28th" Incident: Japanese Troops in the Outskirts in Panic; Chinese Forces Active Along Both Lines; Japanese Authorities Implement Preparations in Advance

Various circles in Shanghai regard January 28th of this month as the ninth anniversary of the first battle of Shanghai during the Songhu War of Resistance. At present, the full-scale War of Resistance is actively progressing, and military advances are being made on all fronts. Millions of soldiers are fighting fiercely to defend the homeland and strive for victory. On this commemorative day, it is even more inspiring and motivating. In order to commemorate the martyrs of the War of Resistance and the compatriots who died, it has been decided to solemnly mourn on this day, and to implement wartime frugality and promote savings to show the determination of the people in the rear to maintain national policies. The Japanese troops stationed in Shanghai and its suburbs, with the anniversary of the January 28th Shanghai Battle approaching, and at a time when the Japanese troops on the front lines are suffering defeats and Chinese guerrilla forces are extremely active along both lines, are deeply fearful that the Chinese army will take the opportunity to launch an attack. Therefore, the situation is even more alarming. It is reported that the Japanese authorities have decided to implement preparations starting from the 25th of this month. All areas such as Nanshi, Zhabei, Jiangwan, Wusong, and Fengxian, Nanhui, and Chuansha in Pudong will increase the number of Japanese and puppet police sentries to strictly prevent and intensify inspections.

### Post Offices Accepting Japanese Currency Are Merely Empty Gestures; The Public Does Not Use Them

The Shanghai Postal Administration has been accepting Japanese currency or Japanese military scrip for the purchase of stamps since yesterday. However, according to a reporter from the Datong News Agency who visited the post office yesterday, the public did not use Japanese currency in the post office. The details are as follows:

The Public Refuses to Use Japanese Currency: The Director of the Shanghai Postal Administration, Zha Pei, and the Deputy Postal Director, the Japanese Jin Zhi Jin Ichiro, unilaterally agreed with the Japanese side that the public could purchase stamps with Japanese currency or Japanese military scrip, and stipulated a conversion rate. Yesterday was the first day of actual acceptance. A reporter from the Datong News Agency made a special trip to the business office on the second floor of the Postal Administration and various branches in the city. The public was deeply aware of the righteousness and has not been found to use Japanese currency or Japanese military scrip at the post office.

The Head Office Will Issue a Severe Reprimand: Furthermore, according to a reporter from the Datong News Agency, the Ministry of Transportation in Chongqing and the Postal Administration in Kunming are unaware of this measure taken by the Shanghai Post Office. Therefore, after the news is published, a telegram of reprimand will be sent within a few days. In addition, all post offices in the occupied areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and the four suburbs of Shanghai will uniformly implement the above-mentioned method of accepting Japanese currency and military scrip starting yesterday.

### Five Hundred Hot Water Shops Sell at Original Prices

After holding an emergency meeting the night before last, the Shanghai Hot Water Industry Association, all members of the industry were deeply aware of the righteousness. Because a price increase would affect the livelihoods of ordinary people throughout the city, they unanimously passed a resolution not to raise prices again. Starting yesterday, they decided to sell at the original prices: (1) One cent for two ladles; (2) One dime for twenty pieces [of firewood]; (3) One yuan for two hundred pieces. There are more than 500 members of the industry in total, and they all abide by the association's resolution. According to Zhang Delong, Chairman of the Association, Shi Xingli, Supervisor, Chen Yishan, Honorary Chairman, and Wang Zhijian, representative, to a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency, the industry has suffered a great deal due to the soaring price of coal. Some businesses have voluntarily temporarily suspended operations. The fundamental solution is to dredge the source of coal and reduce the price of coal to alleviate the burden on the industry. The industry has decided to appeal to society for sympathy and assistance, and plans to send letters to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Public Concession, and the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation today to actively conduct group purchases of coal. On the one hand, they will negotiate with the Kailuan Mining Company to sell coal to the industry at the ex-mine price. At present, all sectors of society have expressed deep admiration for the industry's unanimous opposition to another price increase and will provide assistance within their capabilities. The union will crack down on the few hot water shops that sell each ladle for 20 cash [wen] according to the price increase method.

### Two Puppet Officials in Xiamen Shot in Gulangyu; Huang Lianzhong Died from Four Gunshots; Long Peiying Was Also Wounded but Not Dead

According to a report in the Continental Daily, a telegram from Xiamen on the 14th from the Tongmeng News Agency stated that Huang Lianzhong, a member of the Xiamen Special Municipal Government and Chairman of the Xiamen Overseas Chinese Federation, and Long Peiying, a former Fujian representative to the National Assembly, were ambushed by terrorists on the 8th of this month while walking near the Customs Club in the Gulangyu Public Concession. Huang

was shot four times and died from his serious injuries at 10:50 a.m. on the 14th at the age of 57. Long was also injured and is now gradually recovering. The Gulangyu Public Concession is making every effort to search, but the murderer is still nowhere to be found. After this case occurred, the Japanese naval authorities immediately tightened restrictions on traffic between Gulangyu and the mainland to prevent

the murderer from escaping. On the 9th of this month, the Japanese Consul-General in Xiamen, Uchida, requested that the Director-General of the Public Concession, Hickling, search for the murderer, and claimed that this shooting incident was another case of anti-Japanese terrorism. Hickling assured Uchida that he would take all steps to arrest the criminal, and a reward of 250 yuan has now been offered for the arrest of the murderer.

### British Gunboat Mantis to Be Dismantled After Retirement

The English-language "North China Daily News" reported that the British gunboat HMS Mantis, stationed in China, has been retired and will be dismantled by the Haifan Shipyard. It is noted that her sister ship, HMS Bee, was also dismantled by the Haifan Company more than a year ago.

### Central Savings Association Lottery Yesterday

### Wuzhou Detective Agency Investigates Extortion Case Involving Chinese and Western Detectives; Western Detective Chief Summoned for Confrontation Yesterday

Wuzhou Detective Agency detectives Qiu Haitao, Gao Wenbing, Wang Qi'an, Qian Yongchang, Leng Zhenzhang, and others, together with French detective Ma Ying (transliteration), went to 408 Wang Ju Road at 9:00 a.m. on the 23rd of last month. Under the pretext of searching for prohibited drugs, they extorted 600 yuan in national currency from Du Shaoru, a merchant from Chongming. Du reported this to the French Police Department, which sent detectives to arrest them. Three pairs of handcuffs and 600 yuan in banknotes were seized. Except for the Frenchman Ma Ying, who was sent to the French Consulate for interrogation, the remaining defendants were interrogated and detained by Judge Sun of the Second Special Court for investigation. Details have been published in the newspapers. Judge Sun continued the hearing of the case in the first criminal court yesterday afternoon.

### Suggestions for Suppressing Rice Prices: Legal and Administrative Measures Should Be Taken Simultaneously; Authorities and Residents Should Work Together

— Li

(Continued) (2) Severe Legal Sanctions: A legitimate merchant who trades to make a small profit, no one can curse him. But a group of rice worms; or those who were not rice worms originally, saw money and became greedy, took advantage of the opportunity, and even against their conscience, monopolized and manipulated the people's only rice, raising prices to an unprecedented level. If these people are not severely punished by law, they will disrupt society on a small scale and endanger the country on a large scale. The harm is truly unimaginable. Article 12 of the Regulations on the Administration of Agriculture, Mining, Industry, and Commerce During the Extraordinary Period stipulates that "designated enterprises and goods, their producers and operators, shall not engage in speculation, monopoly, or other manipulative behavior." Then food is one of the designated goods, as stipulated in Article 1, Paragraph 3 of the same regulations, and of course, it must not be monopolized or manipulated. If greed blinds their wisdom and violates the regulations, it is a criminal act. According to Article 31 of the same regulations, they shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not more than five years and fined one to three times the amount of the proceeds. Not only should those who engage in monopoly and manipulation be criminally punished, but even the amount of sales of food between rice shops in the same industry, if it exceeds the amount of existing stock, or if it is based on the sale of standard goods and the calculation of profits and losses based on the difference, or if non-industry people mutually trade futures, or if they establish a market similar to an exchange, this kind of intention to speculate and manipulate is also a criminal act, and the same punishment as before will be imposed, regardless of rank. This is stipulated in Article 13 of the Measures for Determining Prices and Eliminating Speculation and Manipulation During the Extraordinary Period. Both laws have been promulgated, and the Shanghai Special District Court should apply them. Mr. Jiang Liquan, a judge of the Second Special District Court of Shanghai, has already expressed his opinion that it can be applied in accordance with Article 2 of the Agreement on the Chinese Court in the Shanghai Public Concession and Article 3 of the Agreement on the Establishment of the Chinese Court in the Shanghai French Concession. Why should we hide them and not expose them as much as possible?

(3) Find ways to dredge the source: The rice-producing areas actually have a surplus of rice; however, the transportation to Shanghai is blocked by special forces, and neither land nor water transportation is possible. Things are valued when they are scarce. It can be seen that the rise in the price of national rice is not only due to rice worms hoarding and speculating, but also to other reasons. Rice worm profiteers are taking advantage of the opportunity. The authorities of the two concessions are commendable for their good intentions in safeguarding the people's livelihood within the concessions and restricting selling prices! However, on the one hand, it is also necessary to do everything possible to negotiate with the special forces to allow rice to be freely imported; if this cannot be done, residents will forever eat rice at 40 yuan a "dan". I am afraid that the prosperity of Shanghai will turn into a past relic and cannot be maintained. With such expensive rice, all kinds of goods will be affected and rise day by day. May I ask the wage-earning class, who earn 30 to 40 yuan a month, find it insufficient to buy rice. Those who are cunning will become thieves, and those who are cautious will be forced to go to the interior. This is a natural trend that can be imagined. By that time, I don't know how the prosperity within the concession will be maintained.

The first and third points mentioned above are about administrative aspects, and the second point is about legal aspects. They should be implemented simultaneously, and the concession authorities and residents should work together. Not only can rice prices be suppressed, but also various commodity prices will be affected to a considerable extent.

### Grains: Flour May Rise Again; Local Wheat Reaches New High Price; Penghu Buys at High Price and Raises to 18 Yuan; Imported Wheat Prices Still High and Lack Berth Space

Flour was firm and strong yesterday, and the price of No. 2 flour factory remained at 9.8 yuan, and no further increase was made for the time being. However, customer quotations were still not open, because the raw materials for flour milling are becoming increasingly expensive. The opening price of domestic wheat reached a peak of 18 yuan, which is unprecedented. It is reported that the price of returned goods from the "Car and Ship" brand was 10.023 yuan, but there was still a lack of supply. The price of imported flour also rose, and "Foreign Fortress," "Battleship," and "Double Eagle" brands all required 10.056 yuan. Customers made some purchases. The futures trading of "Phoenix" brand flour from Japanese factories disappeared after a dispute a few days ago. It is reported that the price for January was 10.025 yuan, and the spot price was 10.01 yuan.

Wheat prices reached new highs again yesterday, with the opening price of Guan Dian and Suzhou white wheat reaching a peak of 18 yuan, which can be described as the height of its prosperity. At present, the prices of Australian imported wheat are high and there are not many berths, so each factory may not order in large quantities, and domestic wheat stocks are nearly exhausted, so there is a regret that supply is not meeting demand. Therefore, sellers are simply hoarding and the market is becoming increasingly expensive. Yesterday, the market traded three or four trucks of Suzhou Guan wheat, priced at 18 yuan to 17.5 yuan. Fufeng Factory also bought 2,000 bags of Su Xi wheat at 17.2 yuan. Fuxin Factory temporarily did not take in any, it is said.

The price of imported wheat has risen to 24-25 yuan. Factories made three or four telegram orders yesterday, but it is not easy to predict whether the transactions will be successful due to the lack of berth space. The price of domestic wheat is 18 yuan, which is the price paid by oil traders transporting to Gulangyu, so the price is high. The factory flour may need to rise again because the cost has reached 10 yuan.

Regarding flour, 1,000 bags were shipped to Hong Kong yesterday, and 2,000 bags will be shipped to Tianjin today.

### The Market Relies Entirely on Imported Rice; Indica and Japonica Varieties Turn Cold

Recently, the rice market has been dominated by imported rice, and the sales of thick and thin, japonica and Nanhang early and late rice have become sporadic. Yesterday was still in this state. Since it is not easy to transfer from Hongkou, it is said that 500-600 bags were transferred from Hongkou yesterday. The sales of thin rice have always been sluggish, so the market appeared flat and weak, and it has been cut short by 1-2 jiao. Each thick japonica and early and late rice are mostly constrained, and the transactions are also few. However, since the source is not continued, merchants still find it difficult to sell lightly. The supply and demand of white rice are similar, and there is also a lack of fluctuations. The local goods of Lu Yangjian are extremely scarce, and the sales are greatly affected by imported rice, so there are not many openings, and the prices have not changed much. Only various kinds of imported rice, both local shops and merchants are very interested, and merchants from the inland are still buying smoothly, so the morning situation is still high. Pay attention to old goods, new ones are just like that. Regarding new and old Saigon, each has its own characteristics, and the situation is very different. Old Saigon has been raised by 2-3 jiao, while new goods have been flat all the way. In addition, by noon, those who held new Saigon and Da Wen rice suddenly returned to sell together, so the market color showed a tired state. As a result, it fell by 3-4 jiao compared with the previous one. Da Wen rice was 37 yuan and 36.8 yuan. At the same time, old Saigon was inevitably constrained, and the closing price did not fluctuate much, remaining at 37.5 yuan and 37.23 yuan, which was only firm. Other items such as Tokyo Broken Grain and Siamese Broken Rice all follow Saigon's lead.

A small number of imported rice arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, with 1,000 bags from Haiphong and 400 bags from Hong Kong on the Ewo Shipping Company's Yisheng Wheel. They arrived the day before yesterday (the 14th) and docked at Roosevelt Wharf. Unloading was completed yesterday. Yesterday, the company's Dingsheng Wheel arrived in Shanghai, carrying 9,382 bags of imported rice from Hong Kong, which will be shipped to Tianjin by the original ship this afternoon. (Zu)

In other news, the orders for imported rice were not divided yesterday, and the returned goods were not sold off. The market entrants are also waiting and watching, and with the upcoming price reduction, people's hearts are trending downwards. The total transaction for the day was less than 2,000 bags, and the price was reduced by 2-3 jiao. The prices of Saigon No. 1 and No. 2 are both high, and no agreement has been reached for a long time. Even broken rice has not been ordered continuously. However, Fook Kea Trading Company sold 500 tons of broken rice yesterday due to other reasons, and the price was only 33.55 yuan, it is said.

### Oil Market: Soybean Oil Drops Slightly

The soybean oil market opened yesterday, with prices dropping by [Number] yuan compared with the previous market. The opening price for Yan Qi oil was 200 pieces, priced at 75 yuan. The opening price for Qing Qi oil was 100 pieces, priced at 73 yuan. The opening price for Jiaozhou oil was 130 pieces, priced at 70 yuan. The opening price for Changzhou Lai factory oil was 60 barrels, with prices ranging from 99.5 yuan to 98 yuan. At present, under the situation of weak sales, the trend is still less dramatic. The reason is that the large amount of crude oil from Dalian has not been resolved, causing people's hearts to brew uncertainly. I only hope that traders will not willingly be the heads of the insurgents.

Yesterday, 200 bags of soybeans came from Beisha and 700 boxes of raw oil were shipped to Hong Kong.

### Finance
### Chinese and Japanese Merchants Dump Foreign Exchange, US Dollar Reaches 8 Yuan Again

The foreign exchange market yesterday saw no changes in HSBC's listed prices. Although it was the beginning of the week, the black market for British and American currencies remained relatively stable. Most speculators were cautious and observing. Initially, there was some easing, but this was offset by HSBC's absorption and foreign firms buying in. Towards the afternoon, some speculators and Hong Kong Electric successively sold off, causing renewed easing. The reason for the initial selling by Chinese banks was the news report of the Abe cabinet's collapse in Japan. In the morning, due to the continued rise in British and American exchange rates, there was an initial appearance of stability in the British currency and easing in the US currency. Subsequently, due to Chinese banks dumping and Japanese banks (Yokohama Specie Bank) continuing to sell, even though some American banks were willing to absorb at lower prices, the market felt glutted.

### Foreign Exchange Trends Lower, Gold Prices Fall Slightly

Yesterday's cash gold bar black market situation increasingly felt listless. The situation did not leave the realm of hovering. In general, speculators, in light of the poor environment and the weakening foreign exchange market, which was unfavorable to long positions, showed little excitement for buying gold. However, most large long holders did not release their holdings. Only a certain securities firm slightly came out to sell, so the price decline was still slow. Initially, the price fell 13 yuan upon the foreign exchange market's reported loosening, to 4,065 yuan. As the foreign exchange rate continued to harden, the securities firm dumped again, pressing the price down by 3 yuan. Subsequently, as the foreign exchange market stabilized and a certain money exchange firm bought in, the price twice returned to a high of 4,073 yuan. Then, due to gold shops and a certain bank competing to sell, and the buyers being weak, the price fell downward again. By the midday close, it was only 4,068 yuan. Afternoon trading was stagnant, and the fluctuations were not large. Finally, due to the securities firm continuing to sell, the price fell slightly by another 2 yuan, to 4,066 yuan, which was another continuous fall of 12 yuan compared to last Saturday. The total daily trading volume was estimated to be around 700 taels. Jewelry gold shops and customs orders remained flat.

Gold Bar Falls 12 Yuan

From the morning, each bar (10 taels) initially fell 13 yuan compared to last Saturday, to 4,065 yuan, because of news reports that were bad and the hardening of the foreign exchange market. For a moment another gold shop bought 30 taels on behalf of a customer, raising the price back up by 3 yuan, to 4,068 yuan. Then, because the securities firm sold again, and at the same time a certain bank liquidated their floating long positions, the price fell again. The securities firm sold 20 taels to the money exchange firm at 4,062 yuan. After this, the foreign exchange market stabilized, and the money exchange firm's appetite for gold was quite strong, so the price rose again. The money exchange firms conducted 20 taels of business between themselves at 4,073 yuan. At that time, a certain gold shop took the opportunity to sell again, and jewelry shops also dumped, so the price fell back to 4,065 yuan. Then, as the foreign exchange rate stabilized, a certain securities firm bought in at the low price, raising the price back up to 4,073 yuan. But because the gold shop sold again, and a certain bank also came out to sell on behalf of their customers, the price fell again. The gold shop sold 20 taels to the securities firm at 4,067 yuan.

The selling price of cash gold shops' own brand of gold was a few yuan higher than the gold bar price, while the buying price was reduced by 20 yuan. The current bid gold price was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price. There was little trading in both.

In the morning, British order notes fell to 45 yuan, 80 cents, and American gold notes fell to 12 yuan, 55 cents. The intermediate fluctuations were quite dramatic, once falling to 12 yuan, 42 cents.

### Discount Rate Plunges Sharply, Now at 23 Yuan

Around noon, it slightly recovered to 23 yuan and 50 cents.

### Securities
### Foreign Merchant Stocks Reach New Highs, Domestic Debt Market Does Not Escape Rotation

The securities black market yesterday was superficially characterized by firm delivery prices, but changes were brewing beneath the surface. The reorganization of the domestic cabinet might shorten the Sino-Japanese War, but in reality, the warlords are still in power, so there is no cause for optimism. The rumors of Sino-American loans have not been confirmed, so there are still many changes in the environment. Yesterday's trading was flat, and there was no special demand or supply. Although Jardine Matheson still purchased in the morning, it gradually stopped in the afternoon. Later, due to the strong demand for No. 11, the market price suddenly became firm and attractive. Then, Jardine Matheson, Butterfield & Swire, and Cornabé, Eck & Co. successively sought to sell. Although Da Ching, Dong Tai, Union, and others still had a buying appetite, the selling pressure was stronger, so the market slightly turned tired, fluctuating between 1 and 2 cents. In the afternoon, No. 28 bought E-type bonds, and the rest, such as Jardine Matheson, Butterfield & Swire, Jardine Matheson, and Cornabé, Eck & Co., were slightly absorbed, but the selling trend became stronger, and the trend was already weak. Fortunately, the results were still slightly better, rising by 5 cents, 10 cents, to 20 cents. The total transaction volume was about 600,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.

Stock trading: 20 shares of Zhejiang Industrial Bank stock were traded at a price of 78 yuan each.

Yesterday, the Stock Exchange opened in the morning, and the buying interest in industrial stocks was extremely strong. Shares of International Trust Company, Shanghai Bank Company, and Yangtze Bank Company all reached new highs. Ewo Cotton Spinning & Weaving Co., Ltd. showed a small weakness, once rising to 36 yuan and 50 cents. Then, as profit-taking began, the supply of various stocks rebounded. In the afternoon, due to the activities of large buyers, prices trended upward again. The market at the close was firm and attractive. Rubber stocks were ignored, and the prices were stable, mostly resembling the closing prices of the previous day.

### Cotton Yarn
### Tianjin and Hong Kong Merchants Buy in Succession

The cotton yarn market, which had turned up at the end of last week, returned to calm yesterday. This was because there were too many 20-count yarn stocks, and the market was flooded, so sentiment was still peaceful. The demand from Hong Kong merchants showed signs of improvement again, but they chose which brands of yarn to buy. The market atmosphere was not affected in any way. In North China, there was a healthier appetite for coarse yarn. Given this situation, the cotton yarn market should be able to consolidate further. What the future holds depends on actual trading.

Spot Yarn: The opening sentiment was still good because people had a good mood from the previous day. There were still many buyers at the opening, but there were also many sellers. The opening price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was 720 yuan. Then, it was heard that Guangzhou merchants had demand, and the market appeared more expensive, rising to 724 yuan. In the middle, as the foreign exchange rate lengthened, the selling trend rose again. At the same time, there was an excess of Double Horse yarn stocks, which gradually eased, falling to 718 yuan at the close. According to the half-day trading statistics, 2,325 bales were traded. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn fell 4 yuan, Heavenly Maiden fell 5 yuan, and Double Globe fell 6 yuan. Yesterday, 42 pieces of yarn were shipped to Hong Kong, and today, 195 pieces were shipped to Tianjin. The quantities of yarn bought by various merchant groups are listed below:

Tianjin: 400, Companion: 1, 200
Hong Kong: 615
Mainland: 10, Ningbo: 40. Total: 2,325

### Preparing to Close Accounts, Cotton Market Stalls

Trading in native cotton has become quiet because the end of the lunar year is approaching, and everyone is preparing to close their accounts to await the coming year before competing again. Therefore, business has entered a state of stagnation. In addition, overseas cotton markets are already in a state of rotation. The sources of Su cotton: Tonghua, 340 bales; Changyinsha, 114 bales; Beisha Lai, 520 bales. The status of current cotton is recorded below.

Another dispatch states that the price of foreign cotton is as follows: New York cotton market: The market was particularly quiet. Yesterday, due to selling by spot merchants and overseas merchants, cotton prices were extremely weak. As a result, closing prices fell 23 points compared to the previous day. The Indian cotton market rebounded slightly, rising 2 Rupees along with forecasts. Egyptian cotton fell 80 points. Liverpool had no market.

Foreign cotton imports to Shanghai have failed to develop recently. All firms are about to close their accounts due to the imminent arrival of the end of the year. Factories also have sufficient inventory, and yarn prices are difficult to raise, so they have no intention of purchasing. Transactions by Japanese manufacturers are also very quiet. According to this situation, foreign cotton transactions are unlikely to develop this year. The prices of cotton delivered to factories yesterday, converted using a US dollar exchange rate of 7 yuan, 9375, are as follows:

### Piece Goods
### Bleaching and Dyeing Costs Increase, Cloth Prices Follow Up

National Cloth

Cloth prices opened higher yesterday because of the development of domestic and foreign trade and the rise in bleaching, dyeing, and finishing costs. Therefore, the market continued to trend upward. The products of British firms Jardine Matheson and Wheelock Marden, including coarse cloth, fine cloth, twill, printed cloth, and bleached cloth, increased in price by about 50 cents per piece. The increase in prices of products from Chinese factories was relatively moderate, rising by 5 cents to 25 cents per piece. Wholesale stores on this street, fearing that bleaching and dyeing costs would rise further, sent grey cloth to bleaching and dyeing factories early, so transactions in spring goods and grey cloth suddenly increased. Transactions in white goods, fine cloth, twill, coarse cloth, and bleached cloth were close to 200 pieces. Zhejiang and Jiangxi merchants purchased close to 100 pieces of goods from Wheelock Marden and Jardine Matheson. Tianjin merchants purchased over 100 pieces of coarse cloth, coarse twill, and blue cloth. Guangdong and Hong Kong merchants purchased over 4,000 pieces of fine twill and colored cloth. Merchants from Fujian and Southeast Asia also continued to sell.

Eastern Cloth

The morning opening for white goods was flat. Then, the Tianjin merchants scrambled to purchase Dragon Head fine cloth for spot and forward delivery, and transactions reached about 1,000 pieces, raising the market trend. The forward price for Dragon Head this month rose to 21 yuan, 90 cents, the forward price for this month was 22 yuan and 10 cents, and the forward price for the next month was 22 yuan and 50 cents. The total number of forward contracts for various brands of fine cloth was over 600 pieces. Firms on this street and dyeing factories also purchased close to 1,000 pieces of medium- and low-grade fine cloth, so the market trend turned firm. Fine cloth and fine twill both rose by 10 to 20 cents per piece compared to the previous week.

Exports: Yesterday, 20 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong, and today, 140 pieces were shipped to Tianjin.

### Silk and Tea
### Japanese Silk Falls Sharply

At the afternoon close, spot was 2,070 yuan, up 20 yuan, and long-term was 1,999 yuan, down 61 yuan. The local silk market was sluggish and tired, with no activity from foreign firms or domestic sales.

### Red and Green Tea Sell Well in Hong Kong

According to news from Hong Kong, red and green teas from Qimen, Zhide, Pingshui, and other places have arrived in large quantities recently. The sales of British and Russian firms are very lively. Qimen black tea is in particularly short supply due to its special quality. The opening price of Qimen tea was HK$380, and it reached a high of HK$400. The opening price for premium green tea from Luzhuang was 200 yuan, standard grade was 150 yuan, and Pingshui pearl tea was 180 yuan. The price of [unclear] tea was 74 to 5 yuan. The market was very lively. Also, 632 pieces of tea were shipped from Shanghai to Tianjin today.

### Seafood
### Annam Shrimp Tails Supply and Demand in Balance

The source of Annam shrimp tails is still not quiet, and sales continue to flow. Supply and demand can be said to be in balance. Twenty-four boxes of field shrimp tails have arrived again. Although they are small, their bodies are very good, and the price is low. Each picul is only 170 yuan, making them easy to sell. Also, there are two boxes of Chongdong tails, which cost 210 yuan per tree, it is said.

### Sugar Market
### Trading Quiet

The trend in the sugar market remained weak yesterday. The guild's listed price for 24 coarse white sugar for spot was still 56 yuan and 50 cents at this shop, and the new goods at foreign shops were 56 yuan and 50 cents, and the old goods were 56 yuan, down 5 cents.

There were only bids for domestic sugar, and no transactions were made.

### Hardware
### Black Iron Billets, Factory Demand Is Extremely Strong

The smooth trading of black iron billets has been unmatched by other colors recently. Sentiment is extraordinarily buoyant. The standard selling price has risen again by 1 to 2 yuan. For example, a 200-pound box sells for 86 yuan, and a 2,000-pound bundle sells for 900 yuan. Yesterday's market traded over 600 boxes, mostly purchased by local thermos factories, mirror factories, printing factories, and iron can factories. The business of guest merchants was relatively quiet because their stocks are quite abundant. Therefore, although factory demand is strong, there is no risk of imbalance between supply and demand, it is said.

### Coal
### Haifeng Coal Has Smooth Sales

Hongji coal stoves, influenced by the weather, have had sluggish sales recently. However, the demand for Haifeng white coal from restaurants and pubs is quite strong, and sales are very good. Yesterday, the market traded 600 to 700 tons. The firms' listed price is 120 yuan. Although the warehouse receipts of hoarding households are slightly cheaper, only a few are open for business. The price of lump coal at stores on this street is 124 yuan per ton, and screened lump is 128 yuan. For factories far away, transportation costs are added appropriately.

### Dried Goods
### Longkou Vermicelli Continues to Fall

There has been more demand for fine vermicelli on this street recently, but Longkou goods have fallen again, with a decrease of up to 10 yuan. Yesterday's market only sold 106 yuan. There were no other major changes. For example, Qingdao vermicelli was 100 yuan to 95 or 6 yuan, and Jiangbei vermicelli was 70 yuan for the top grade and 45 or 6 yuan for the middle grade.

Education News

### Guangdong Military District Promotes War of Resistance Education to Encourage the Public to Join the Army

(Shaoguan Dispatch) The Guangdong Military District Command, in order to popularize the education of the War of Resistance, enable the people to understand their military service obligations, possess a sense of national identity and ethnic consciousness, actively join the army, voluntarily enlist, and strengthen the power of the War of Resistance, has specially drafted measures to promote the education of the War of Resistance. After consulting with the Provincial Department of Education, it has issued orders to all counties to comply with and implement them. According to the main points of the measures, all levels of schools should adopt wartime education courses as much as possible, and fully instill in all students and young people a sense of national identity and ethnic consciousness. During school holidays, teachers and students should organize political work teams and propaganda teams to go deep into the people, publicize the great achievements of the Chinese army's War of Resistance, inspire the public's conscience, and encourage them to join the army enthusiastically.

### An Overview of the Promotion of Free Education in China (8)

(8) Conclusion

Looking at the above results, the promotion of compulsory education in China has indeed entered the implementation stage from the advocacy stage. Although the achievements of its promotion have only lasted for more than two years, it is still impossible to draw concrete conclusions and evaluations. Although the figures reported by the provinces and cities are not as optimistic as the planned expectations, generally speaking, the results achieved have reached more than half of the planned targets. If the war ends, further detailed reviews are conducted, effective measures are revised, sufficient funds are raised, and administrative institutions are improved, then the plan to increase the number of school-age children to more than 80% may not be impossible to realize. However, judging from past experience and actual circumstances, the most important thing in the process of promoting compulsory education is administration. Whether the implementation of all government orders in China can succeed or not, administrative personnel often account for 70 to 80%, while methods and systems account for only 20 to 30%. Education cannot be an exception. Therefore, the same method may be effective in Province A, but Province B may have resentment and difficulties. The key lies entirely in the transfer of personnel and administrative organization. Guangxi, as a poor and backward province, has been able to establish schools in all townships in four or five years. Although there may be differences in quality, the foundation has been laid, and improvement is easy. Popularization can be achieved as scheduled. Therefore, in the future, in promoting compulsory education, the central government must pay special attention to local administration and personnel issues. The second is the funding problem. In the past, the difficulty of promoting compulsory education in various provinces and cities was concentrated on the funding point. However, if a poor area like Guangxi can establish schools in every township, the funds are all raised locally, and the most important method is to use local public property, collect labor, and use public cultivation methods to use the harvest as a school fund. After a few years, the township can establish a basic national school and obtain permanent funding without having to rely on external assistance. Therefore, in the future, in promoting compulsory education, it is essential to focus on the collection of funds for the establishment of national schools in each township. The third is the method. In the past, the central government's plan to promote compulsory education focused on first establishing one-year short-term primary schools on a large scale, and after a few years, gradually converting them into two-year short-term primary schools and four-year ordinary primary schools. Now that the outline of the county-level organization network has been promulgated, the promotion of compulsory education in the future will be entirely based on establishing a national school in each township and a central primary school in each township (town). The basic unit for establishing primary schools in various places is entirely in the townships and towns, which is not much different from the original unit of the primary school district. The length of schooling in township national schools is set at four years. If due to economic reasons, the length of schooling can be two years as the end of compulsory education, which also corresponds to the original planned two-year short-term primary school. Therefore, if provinces, counties, and cities can delineate the area of the townships as soon as possible and then establish national schools in stages according to the actual situation in various places, the plan for popularization can be achieved as scheduled.

### The Chinese Chemical Society Investigates Members in Shanghai

Since the outbreak of the war, academic talents have mostly moved around without a fixed place, losing contact. All affairs of the Chinese Chemical Society have almost completely stalled. In August last year, the first annual meeting in extraordinary times was convened in Kunming. The seventh issue of the journal was recently published in Chengdu and has been received in Shanghai. However, the addresses of members have mostly changed after the war. The General Assembly is eager to make contact and hopes that members will notify Yuan Hanqing of Chongqing Central University of their new mailing addresses at any time for communication and to send publications. As for the association's expenses, it is also extremely lacking due to not collecting membership fees for more than two years. It has now been agreed that the Jing'an Temple Road/Gordon Road branch of the Xinhua Savings Bank will collect fees on behalf of the association in Shanghai to facilitate collection and submission to the General Assembly. Permanent members can also donate as appropriate so that the association's affairs can proceed as usual.

### School News

### Letter

To the Editor,

Shanghai educational circles, considering that commodity prices in Shanghai are soaring and that it is necessary to slightly increase tuition fees and improve treatment, have decided through a general discussion to appropriately increase tuition fees and treatment to maintain livelihoods and have notified their members accordingly. Unexpectedly, a dispatch from the Xinhua News Agency in Chongqing on the 14th indicated that there were other motives, which is very surprising. Our association has expressed its views and decided on its own actions based on the opinions of its members, but the news agency's statement is incredible. We are sending this letter to the Shen Bao.

Shanghai Education Association, January 15, the 29th year of the Republic of China.

### Passive Earthquake Prevention Methods

— Li Shaozhong

Beginning on the morning of December 27, 1939, and continuing for several days, Turkey unfortunately suffered an unprecedented earthquake. According to a recent survey report released by the Turkish government, the death toll in Erzincan alone reached more than 14,000. In other places such as Gasiqi, Yuegate, Simashia, and Tokat, the total number of deaths was about 12,000, and the number of injured was about 4,000. The survivors in the disaster area will be moved to other places, and the earthquake area will become a "no man's land."

Originally, the loss of life and property is an inevitable result of a major earthquake. Often within a few minutes, the loss of life is staggering. For example, 50,000 people died in the Lisbon earthquake in 1755; 180,000 people died in the great earthquake in China in 1920; 200,000 people died in the great earthquake in Japan in 1922; and in the statistical figures we know, the earthquake with the highest number of deaths was the great earthquake in India in 1737, which killed 300,000 people. The above figures are inevitably exaggerated, but the statistics on the deaths and injuries in the great earthquake in Japan in 1923 will not be wrong. In that famous earthquake in Japan, 99,331 people died and 103,733 people were injured (including the number of people who died or were injured in the fire caused by the earthquake).

Until now, we have not been able to directly control the power of earthquakes. But we can try to reduce the destructive power of earthquakes: first, predict the occurrence of earthquakes and prepare to move to a safe place as soon as possible; second, choose the location and form of buildings appropriately to reduce the degree of damage during earthquakes. Research on earthquake prediction is still in its early stages, but considerable progress has been made. As for the appropriate choice of the location of buildings, according to past experience, we know that buildings on solid rock suffer the least damage during earthquakes, followed by houses built on soft soil, and houses on "newly formed" land are the most dangerous, especially on filled ponds or riverbanks. Therefore, in areas with frequent earthquakes, building houses should avoid being near cliffs or riverbanks. In Japan and other countries with frequent earthquakes, great attention has long been paid to the form and structure of buildings. According to the situation during the earthquake in Japan in 1923, brick and stone houses were the most easily damaged, while wooden houses were able to remain standing, but their only drawback is that they easily accelerate the spread of fire. Modern steel and brick houses are quite effective in restraining earthquakes and fires.

### Books on the Bus

— Cao Lingyou

We all know that people in the 20th century must constantly increase their knowledge; otherwise, they will not be able to keep up with the times and become outdated, turning into Confucian scholars. We must constantly expand our own world, making it vast and broad, in order to enjoy a rich and interesting life.

But in this bustling city of Shanghai, the solution to the problem of livelihood and the burden of work are enough to hinder us from increasing our knowledge. Most of our knowledge comes from books. How many people can spare an hour a day to read books and improve themselves? But people living in Shanghai rely on vehicles to seek convenience when traveling from east to west and from west to east. Since this is the case, then everyone must spend a considerable amount of time in vehicles every day, so the time on the bus can really be used to read books.

A few years ago, a newspaper reported that an old gentleman in England in his forties read law books on the tram to and from his office every day. After more than ten years, he applied for the judge's exam. Although he was not admitted because his education did not meet the exam requirements, he was ranked at the top of the list in the entire exam and was admitted as an honorary judge. The news spread and became a hot topic. This shows that if the time on the bus is used properly, the achievement is not small. On the other hand, reading on a bumpy bus is harmful to the eyes, so it may be a loss. Therefore, there is a suggestion for "Books on the Bus."

A famous foreign educator named Gulick once suggested compiling "Books on the Bus," which is worth learning from. He believes that the fonts in the "Books on the Bus" should be larger than the fonts in ordinary books, and the spacing between lines should also be wider. As for the content of the books, it should be interesting and avoid the disadvantages of being boring. It is also necessary to cause reflection from reading, so that the eyesight is not used excessively.

This is a small suggestion. I hope that the wise will express their opinions. At the same time, I sincerely hope that publishers can adopt and implement it.

### Gravel

— Qian Changnian

(1) Poverty and Generosity

He was extremely poor when he was young, but he often bought clothes and treated his lover to the theater.

When he got older, he had property and children. But he grumbled for a long time when his wife spent a few more coins to buy oil.

A person is most "generous" when he is "poorest"; when he has money, he does not recognize even his own wife, let alone his friends.

(2) Contradictory Phenomenon

The teacher said to the students:

"What is a 'contradiction'? Who can answer?"

A student stood up and said:

"I know: there are 700,000 piculs of rice stored in Shanghai, but everyone is starving. Is this considered a 'contradiction'?"

The teacher nodded.

"There's more!" Another student rushed to say: "Teacher, there is a person whose salary is not enough to support his wife and children, but he still has to bear the high price of rice and rent. Yet, he still stays in Shanghai. Isn't this a 'contradiction'?"

The teacher nodded, turning his body towards the blackboard. He was about to cry.

(3) Intelligence is Like Firelight

Intelligence is like firelight: it can illuminate the world, and it can also destroy the world.

### New Law of Capital Punishment

— Meng Gu

The German secret police, world-renowned for their abuse of Jews, are said to have recently invented a new method of capital punishment. This method is very easy to do, but it is only effective in Germany. They blindfolded the prisoner, told him to stretch out his hands forward, palms open, and then placed a piece of butter and bacon on the prisoner's palms. After everything was ready, they untied the cloth covering the prisoner's eyes. The prisoner suddenly saw butter and bacon in his hands and was shocked to death.

Since dictators were born, many myths about dictators have sprung up all over the world. The new method of capital punishment mentioned above is certainly not true, but it is just a myth recently popular in Paris. However, Hitler took the German people's money for buying butter to buy cannons, and the people starved and suffered, regarding butter and bacon as something they could not get. If butter and bacon suddenly fell from the sky into their hands, they would hardly be able to avoid being shocked to death.

Although it is a myth, it is still a plausible and lovable myth.

### Espionage in the Heel

— Jiali

When the German army swept through the small country of Belgium with a blitzkrieg strategy in 1914, a Belgian wounded soldier named Fobroke followed a group of displaced refugees and crossed the Dutch border to seek treatment in a hospital. His wound was on the heel of his left foot.

After the doctor performed surgery and a considerable period of recuperation, Fobroke's wound healed, and he picked up his crutches and ran to the surgeon's office to request discharge. At that time, it happened that an Englishman said to the doctor that he was looking for a proper and reliable person to take a piece of intelligence to the German-occupied Antwerp and hand it over to a British intelligence agency. Fobroke had learned some elementary English in elementary school, so he heard everything they said.

Fobroke deliberately coughed loudly and stretched out his bandaged foot and said, "Hide the intelligence in my wound."

Within a few minutes, the Dutch surgeon and the Englishman were convinced that Fobroke would not immediately become a martyr or follow in the footsteps of the assistant in a detective novel who died, and they decided to entrust the mission to Fobroke. Therefore, Fobroke was immediately sent to the operating room, where the doctor reopened his already healed wound and inserted a small silver tube containing the intelligence. When the new wound was fully closed, Fobroke walked out of the hospital, dressed like an ordinary person, leaning on a crutch, and limping.

How he arrived in Antwerp is unknown because he never mentioned it to anyone. His foot underwent a second operation, and as a result, the British intelligence officer obtained his intelligence.

Fobroke woke up from the anesthesia, gathered his courage, pointed to his foot, and asked, "Is there any reply?"

After the silver tube was disinfected, it was sewn back into his heel.

Two weeks later, Fobroke returned to Holland. His heel was cut open again, and the silver tube and the reply inside were taken out. This time his wound was finally sewn up.

After the armistice was signed, Fobroke quietly returned to his old business of managing his fruits and vegetables. He received three medals and a well-deserved pension. He used this money to buy half of the shares in the store. Although he was lame, he managed the store very seriously. Fobroke was kind and easy to get along with, which may be the key to his being able to safely pass through the strict German lines many times!

### Recent Events in the Old Capital's Peking Opera Circle

— Shao

Zhang Junqiu was arrested for no reason

Last year, the female Peking Opera singer Xin Yanqiu was arrested in Beiping for special reasons. A certain party originally planned to execute her, but fortunately, a so-called "Commander Jin" interceded for Xin, and she was released. Recently, the famous Dan Zhang Junqiu was also arrested by a certain party. It is said that someone reported Junqiu for hiding multiple radios at home, which was related to politics. However, this was completely irrelevant. After Junqiu was arrested, many attempts to rescue him failed. Later, he was also released on bail by "Commander Jin" and was able to regain his freedom. "Commander Jin" is a woman who has special influence in Beiping, so many people in the Peking Opera circle are close to her.

Jin Zhongren and Xun Huisheng

Xiaosheng and Dan roles are very important in Peking Opera. The Xiaosheng of the four famous Dans have been partners for many years and are not easily replaced. Since Yu Zhenfei and Cheng Yanqiu broke up, Jin Zhongren recently separated from Xun Huisheng. Zhongren and Huisheng have been working together for more than ten years. Huisheng's masterpieces such as "Thirteen Sisters," "Hua Tian Cuo," and "Yu Tang Chun" cannot be performed well without Zhongren as the partner. In the middle, Huisheng once broke up with Zhongren and invited Chen Shengtai, but it was not long before Huisheng thought Shengtai was incompetent and invited Zhongren to join again. Huisheng's emphasis on Zhongren can be seen from this. Therefore, this time he resolutely separated from Jin Zhongren, which was unexpected by ordinary people. It is heard that the reason for this incident was that Zhongren followed Wang Yurong to the south last time. The supporting roles of Yurong, in addition to Jin, such as Zhu Binxian and Sun Futing, were all from Xun's troupe. Xun thought that the departure of these three people had a great impact on his performance. Although Zhongren asked Huisheng for leave before leaving, Huisheng thought that he had been very kind to Jin and should not ignore him, so he was very unhappy. As a result, after Jin returned to Beiping, he was unable to rejoin Xun's Qingsheng Society, and the Xiaosheng role of Qingsheng Society has been replaced by Xu Hecai from the Opera School. In addition, the clown Zhu Binxian was also separated from Xun in disguise because Huisheng had invited Ma Fulu for a long time. Binxian originally joined Qingsheng Society after Fulu. It is understandable that Xun abandoned Binxian and used Fulu, but it is a pity that Zhongren and Huisheng have been together for many years and are now separated.

Tan Fuying's "Calling Xiaofan"

Two years ago, Tan Fuying and Zhang Junqiu's performance in Huangjin was a sensation. Tan's plays were all sold out, especially the plays "Visiting Mother" and "Entering the Palace Twice." However, Fuying sang "Visiting Mother" four times in Huangjin, and the gag of the sentence "Standing in front of the palace gate calling Xiaofan" was not good every time. Before the fourth performance, his father, Xiao Pei, asked Fuying to practice at home in advance. Fuying worked hard to shout "Calling Xiaofan" dozens of times, and the results were quite good. However, on the stage, he still couldn't shout "Calling Xiaofan." Now that Fuying is performing in Beiping, the appeal is no less than that of Ma Lianliang. Usually, the ticket price is sold for one yuan and two jiao, but when "Visiting Mother" is performed, the seat price rises to two yuan. Every time this play is performed, it is sold out. The only fly in the ointment is that he still cannot cope with the gag of "Calling Xiaofan." It is said that Fuying must sing "Calling Xiaofan" several times when he warms up his voice at home, and he sings very well every time, but when he gets on the stage, he can't sing it. It's also a strange thing.

### After Watching "Chen Yuanyuan"

At the banquet in Wu'an, I saw two twin-haired girls,

Blood and tears, the beautiful eyebrows fell into the hands of thieves and returned,

Not for the ruler and parents to return to the homeland,

But for a woman to descend the Xiong Pass.

In Wu Meicun's poem, he completely attributed Wu Sangui's introduction of wolves into the house and kneeling to please foreigners to "rushing to the crown in anger for a beautiful woman." This is perhaps a subconscious expression of "women are the source of trouble," but in general legends that deliberately publicize "heroes and beauties," the authors often ignore the political and social background at the time and use "personal love" to make future generations sigh endlessly. Jiang Qi's "Chen Yuanyuan" breaks away from the old category of "overthrowing the country and the city." He does not focus on Chen Yuanyuan, but criticizes the two different political tendencies of Wu Sangui and Li Chuang through the historical background of Chen Yuanyuan's character. In "Who is Chen Yuanyuan," he has this passage: "Historians have finally not obliterated their conscience. They wrote how Wu Sangui was willing to shave his hair and braid it, surrender to the Qing Dynasty, and how he forced and pressed Li Chuang to the point of exhaustion; and how cruel and brutal he was, personally killing the last drop of blood of the Ming Dynasty – the Yongli Emperor. Inadvertently, we discovered that Wu Sangui did not completely betray his country and surrender to the enemy for Chen Yuanyuan, but instead told us that Wu Sangui was mainly willing to overthrow the country because of his political ambitions." Therefore, the "Chen Yuanyuan" on the stage is not so much about recovering Chen Yuanyuan's innocence as it is about making us see Wu Sangui's face clearly. (To be continued)

### Random Notes on Opera Troupes in Zhuan Yun Hu

— Su Shaoqing

The Imperial Entertainers of the Former Qing Dynasty (Part 1)

Those actors from the Former Qing Dynasty who were selected to serve in the inner court were called Civilian Students, and outsiders flatteringly called them Imperial Entertainers. In fact, there is a clear distinction between Imperial Entertainers and ordinary students. The name Imperial Entertainer can be traced back to the Tang Dynasty. Emperor Ming Huang loved music and created the Pear Garden, recruiting children from the common people to study songs, taught by Zhang Yefu, Lei Haiqing, Huang Fancho, Li Guinian, etc. Zhang, Li, and others often accompanied the Emperor's seat to make music together, so Zhang, Li, and others were called Imperial Entertainers, and the rest of the students were just students. Later, Emperor Zhuangzong of the Later Tang Dynasty favored actors, and some were even sent to be prefects. This was the beginning of the name Imperial Entertainer for actors. Others who each held one skill and prepared to perform plays were still just students. In the early years of the Former Qing Dynasty, following the old system of the Ming Dynasty, eunuchs and actresses were used for music and dance in front of the Emperor. It wasn't until the establishment of the Southern Troupe in the early years of Qianlong that the Inner Eunuch learned opera. After the Southern Tour, actors were selected from the common people of Jiangnan to sing in the inner court, called Southern Troupe Outside Students, to distinguish them from the Inner Eunuchs learning art. Soon, the Jingshan Outside School was added. Outside the Jingshan Outside School, there were also large and small troupes. Not only were famous actors selected, but also young children learned within, almost like the outside opera schools. If they entered the inner court to perform plays, they were called Imperial Entertainers. Can a child under the age of ten also be an Imperial Entertainer? I know that is certainly not the case. The Southern Troupe and Jingshan systems had different rewards, official salaries, and food stipends. During the Jiaqing Dynasty, two Outside School actors, Yu Fu and Lan Xiang, held sixth-rank official positions, and one, Xi Qing, held a seventh-rank official position, called official students (see the Archives of the Shengping Department in the Daoguang Year). This can truly be called Imperial Entertainers. It is clear that those who only received food stipends without official positions could not be called Imperial Entertainers.
