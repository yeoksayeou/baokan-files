### Hull Reaffirms Stance: U.S. Far East Policy Unchanged, Determined to Swiftly Advance Great Defense Program, Building Air Bases in the South Pacific

Washington - Secretary of State Hull indirectly declared yesterday that the U.S. stance, based on maintaining the status quo in the Pacific, remains unchanged. The Secretary of State made this statement in response to reporters' questions regarding U.S. Ambassador to Japan Grew's conversation with Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka in Tokyo on Wednesday. Hull stated that he had previously expressed the U.S. government's position on the entire Pacific region and the policies adopted by the U.S. in that region. (United Press dispatch of the 21st)

Washington - U.S. Ambassador to Japan Grew's strong declaration in Tokyo was supported yesterday by U.S. Secretary of State Hull, who also stated that the U.S. insists on maintaining the status quo in the Far East, which has not changed. The U.S. government stated in a note to Japan on December 31, 1938, that "The U.S. government reserves all existing rights and does not allow these rights to be undermined in any way." However, this note has not yet received a response from Japan. Hull stated that the U.S. position has not changed. Hull's remarks followed Ambassador Grew's speech. It is generally believed here that the U.S. considers Japan's "intimidating behavior" to be instigated by Germany. Therefore, Grew's speech is a clear warning to Japan.

### President Roosevelt Announces the Organization of a Four-Person National Defense Council, Knox and Stimson to Participate in the Work

Washington - President Roosevelt announced yesterday a plan to organize a four-person National Defense Committee during this emergency period, to be responsible for all matters related to national defense production, procurement, and budgeting. Mr. Knudsen, the current Chairman of the National Defense Advisory Commission, will serve as Chairman of the new committee. Labor leader Hillman, who is also a member of the old commission, will be the Deputy Director of the new committee.

Roosevelt said that he will grant all powers within the scope permitted by the Constitution. He also said that the new committee will manage three major tasks: (1) the manufacturing of armaments; (2) the procurement of items needed for national defense, to be headed by the renowned businessman Nelson; and (3) national defense budgeting, to be headed by Knudsen, Hillman, industrial magnate Stettinius, and Henderson. President Roosevelt also said that Stettinius' responsibility will likely include the cooperation of the national steel industry and the maintenance of a sufficient amount of copper. When asked whether the new committee could speed up the completion of the national defense program, he said that the national defense program is already accelerating every day, and this new plan is simply a way to further accelerate it.

### Coping with Domestic Difficulties: Japan Reorganizes Cabinet, Hiranuma Appointed Minister of Home Affairs, Yanagawa Replaces Kazami Akira as Minister of Justice

Tokyo - Japanese Prime Minister Konoe has begun to reshuffle his cabinet today, dismissing members he considers to be lacking in talent and not fully supportive of the Japanese government's "construction of new political institutions" program. Konoe has appointed Kiichirō Hiranuma as Minister of Home Affairs to replace Yasui Eiji, and has also appointed Heisuke Yanagawa as Minister of Justice to replace Kazami Akira. Baron Hiranuma previously served as Prime Minister, and General Yanagawa is also considered by people to be qualified to be Prime Minister. Konoe's current appointment of these two people to take charge of important domestic affairs, in order to overcome the government's difficulties in the full meeting of the Imperial Cabinet, is of great significance. In the eyes of the political world, Konoe's move is considered very important, because he has dismissed his closest friends, Yasui Eiji and Kazami Akira.

Cabinet Encounters Public Opposition

The appointment of Hiranuma and Yanagawa, who have served as Ministers without Portfolio and Presidents of the China Affairs Bureau since December 6, is regarded by the political world as the Cabinet's encounter with public opposition on domestic issues. The domestic people's opposition to the government's increased wartime control plan has made the Cabinet feel severe pressure. However, according to Japanese sources, the Cabinet is not planning to resign en masse at this time. Japanese sources also said that Konoe has planned to appoint former Army Minister Araki Sadao as Minister without Portfolio to succeed Hiranuma. In reshuffling the cabinet, Konoe apparently believes that Hiranuma is a politician with considerable authority, and Yanagawa is an important member of the military. These two will be able to support the Cabinet and cope with general domestic pressure, and cope with the pressure from the domestic economic world. Yanagawa's appointment as Minister of Justice also shows that the power of the military's participation in domestic affairs is increasing. Before the cabinet reorganization, Konoe and other domestic political leaders held several meetings from last night until this morning. Japanese newspapers have said that this meeting will achieve the strengthening of the "second stage" of the Konoe Cabinet, and the "first stage" was the previous appointment of Hiranuma as Minister without Portfolio. Yesterday, Konoe began talking with various leaders, and met with Hiranuma before the cabinet meeting. After yesterday's cabinet meeting, Konoe had another conversation with Hiranuma. Keeper of the Privy Seal Koichi Kido also visited Konoe from 8:15 last night until 10:00 before leaving. After Kido left, Konoe summoned Cabinet Secretary-General Tomita Kenji to the official residence to discuss matters until a few minutes before midnight. Tomita then visited Ōta, the Secretary-General of the Hiranuma Cabinet in 1939, and talked until 1:00 AM.

Japanese Parliament to Meet Next Week

Konoe summoned five Japanese leaders to his palace residence again at 8:00 this morning. These five people are Railway Minister Ogawa Gotaro, Welfare Minister Kanemitsu, Overseas Affairs Minister Akita Kiyoshi, Commerce and Industry Minister Kobayashi Ichizo, and Transportation Minister Murata Shozo. These nine people are all representatives of former labor parties and large enterprises. This morning, Hiranuma met with Ōta. Because he urgently needed to go to Konoe's palace residence for consultation, he cancelled his planned trip to a shrine in western Japan. Ōta has told the press that he fears he will not be able to join the cabinet. Asahi Shimbun believes that Konoe's reorganization of the cabinet is intended to implement its policies with a strong cabinet on the eve of the full meeting of the Imperial Parliament. The 76th full meeting of the Japanese Imperial Parliament will be held on December 26, but will be adjourned during the New Year period. Yanagawa is the first officer to serve as Minister of Justice, and on August 1, 1898, General Yamagata once served as Minister without Portfolio in the Ito Cabinet. (United Press dispatch of the 21st)

Araki Sadao Will Rejoin the Cabinet

Tokyo - The appointments of Hiranuma and Yanagawa were held at the Imperial Palace at 3:00 PM. According to Japanese official sources, it is generally believed that Hiranuma's appointment as Minister of Home Affairs will increase the right-wing forces in the Cabinet, and in the future, "Hiranuma as the Axis" may become the center of the Cabinet. It is expected that the position of Secretary-General of the Asia Development Board will be promoted by Major General Suzuki, the Director of the Political Department of the Board. Semi-official sources expect that Araki will serve as Minister without Portfolio to succeed Hiranuma. As for Yasui's discomfort in his position, it is said that friction occurred with internal regular personnel. According to today's Asahi Shimbun, Kazami Akira has a considerable voice in succeeding the President of the National Service Association. Ōta, a member of the House of Peers who served as Secretary-General of the Hiranuma Cabinet, told reporters a few days ago that he will join the strengthened cabinet, but only in an advisory capacity. Ōta met with Hiranuma this morning. Lieutenant General Yanagawa is 61 years old this year, and is a classmate of former Army Minister Hata Shunroku and former Minister of Colonial Affairs Koiso at the Military Academy. Arima visited Konoe at 4:00 PM today. It is said that the cabinet changes and other issues related to the National Service Association were discussed. (Reuters dispatch of the 21st)

Editorial

### The Opportunity to Reorganize Existing Salaries and Wages

Since the price of rice has soared to 100 yuan per picul, the nominal price limit for foreign rice, although 87 yuan, with lower prices decreasing successively, the black market is still rampant. Flour, which occupies a secondary position in food supply, is still believed to be insufficient at 20 yuan per bag, and is also emerging on the black market. In addition, the manipulation of the oil market and the frequent rise in cloth prices; everything needed for daily life is under so-called "control," with levies and exactions at every turn, regardless of size, resulting in goods being rare and everything being expensive; obtaining inferior goods at premium prices, and selling dog meat under the guise of mutton. This direct threat to all levels of society is already extremely serious. Moreover, the indirect influences are countless, such as house rentals

the top fees of small rentals easily reaching thousands of gold, the repeated price increases of electricity, telephones, streetcars, and public buses, and the progressive obstruction of cargo transportation between the interior and Shanghai. Moreover, as waves propel the water to rise, it is similar to the sudden increase in the expenditures of public utilities, making it necessary to increase donations and taxes, which is still taken from the residents; the heavy burden of the commercial and industrial sectors, which makes it necessary to recoup expenses from the selling prices, ultimately transferring the burden to the consumers; as a result, the general residents are the final bearers of all the price increases.

In previous years, a monthly salary of 100 yuan was still considered a middle-class employee or a top-class worker, able to support a family of eight without starvation; but now, even daily meals are difficult to sustain. Although there have been increases in salaries and wages in all sectors and industries, the increases are often still unable to resolve the difficulties of employees' lives. Moreover, this only applies to a few large companies and firms. As for ordinary shops, either because the cost of incoming goods has doubled, making turnover difficult, or because the increases in water, electricity, and taxes are already high, making the burden unbearable, or because the price of rice and the cost of packaged meals mean that employing a shop assistant entails a large expense. Under these various real conditions and various pretexts, wages

are not supplemented with allowances; for those who work as shop assistants, wages are even lower than those of small laborers. However, even to maintain one's own life, it is still felt to be insufficient, let alone taking care of one's parents and children?

The greatest purpose of mankind is survival. Therefore, the greatest punishment for the most heinous crimes is the deprivation of the right to survive. Are today's prices not already endangering the survival of the majority of people, and what guilt do they bear? It is attributed to currency devaluation; this is either due to simple thinking or malicious sabotage. Ignoring the fact that the black market exchange rate has not changed during this period, but prices have soared (the recent tightening of the black market exchange rate has other reasons), it can be seen that today's high prices are still no more than

the blockade of the interior's products coming to Shanghai, being subjected to "control," the hoarding and speculation of speculators, and the manipulation of prices. When supply and demand are not properly adjusted, prices take flight. Is it truly the fault of currency devaluation? When people are at their wit's end and cannot make a living, they would rather disregard laws and regulations than commit suicide. Observing the major cases of murder and robbery in the past year, and even the disputes of snatching food on the streets, they are more numerous than in the past. It can be seen that there are those who are driven to become thieves. Is that not to be pitied? As for the hundreds of strikes and work slowdowns, apart from a few with other backgrounds, becoming additional reasons, they are fundamentally due to the hardship of life. Therefore, in principle, strikes and work slowdowns should be recognized as the right to strive for survival. If prices are not stabilized and lives are not adjusted thereafter, the trend of the situation expanding day by day is almost inevitable. Those who bear responsibility on all sides; if they must wait until they are completely burned before realizing the loss of not having moved the chimney early, it will be too late.

I believe that in this society, each individual has an urgent need to adjust his own life; in other words, in this extraordinary period, to still forcibly maintain all of his usual enjoyment, such as having to eat delicacies, having to travel by transport, and having to employ servants in the family, is to act beyond one's means, is to resist the times, and is to bring suffering upon oneself. At the same time, all circles and all industries have an urgent need to adjust their salaries and wages; because most current salaries and wages are still based on the pre-war situation, and there are few places that can adapt to the socio-economic conditions and make reasonable increases; either they are slightly increased and perfunctorily treated with minimal increases, or they are not increased and cruelly rejected. Do not say that it is contrary to reason and emotion, but the fact that a picul of rice costs 100 yuan is still present. Who can go hungry, and who does not have a wife and children?

Now, some sectors and industries use allowances as remedies. The allowance system has its own advantages, and it is even considered virtuous compared to having no allowances at all. However, please make a further review, how about it? The original theory of allowances is that salaries and wages are regular expenses, while allowances are temporary expenses. If salaries and wages are adjusted and become permanent fixed amounts, then operating expenses will inflate, and profits and losses will be uncertain and lack flexibility, which is not beneficial to the business. Therefore, it is better to use allowances to compensate for the inadequacy of salaries and wages, and it is not advisable to adjust salaries and wages suddenly. This view is good for stability, but bad for rigidity; because prices are so high to such an extent, it is unlikely to fall suddenly in a short time. It is almost impossible to return to the pre-war state. Even if it does, it must go through considerable twists and turns, and the time will certainly not be near, and it is unknown until what month. Not only this, today's war is a thorough and profound matter for the country and the nation. In spirit and material, nothing is not in the process of革彼興, old dying and new being born; if after the war everything, such as prices and salaries and wages, actually returned to the pre-war state, then there would also be many hidden worries, which would not be beneficial to the country, nation, and society. Business owners, if they can clearly see this and make timely changes, then why stick to the allowance system? The number of allowances and salary increases may not be very different, but the encouragement given to employees and the spirit that benefits the business from a reasonable adjustment of salaries and wages are not the same as the allowances of the same amount. The year is about to end, let all sectors and industries carefully consider it.

### Mediterranean Has Now Become the Main Center of the Anglo-Italian War; British Forces in North Africa Intensify Encirclement of Bardia; 30,000 Italian Troops Rely on Perilous Terrain for a Final Stand

London: A Reuters military commentator stated that the Mediterranean has temporarily become the main center of the war. News from the region remains extremely exciting. Italian troops are currently under heavy attack and pressure from British land, sea, and air forces. Bardia has already been surrounded. Based on the experience gained so far regarding Italian resistance, it is predicted that Bardia will soon fall into British hands. Italian Commander-in-Chief General Graziani seems unable or unwilling to relieve the danger in Bardia. According to British aerial reconnaissance reports, the only road available to the Italians has only troops moving toward Derna and Tobruk. After the British cavalry won a victory near Qalala al-Bir, the extreme left wing of the British army, starting from Siwa, seems to have made progress. There is a road from there to Tobruk. There is no reason to believe that the British operation will stop with the occupation of Bardia. The British forces are in an excellent position, their morale is high, and they can take advantage of the victory to advance to Derna and Tobruk, and then conduct a second battle to occupy Benghazi. As for the Adriatic Sea, the British Navy has launched fierce attacks on the port of Valona and even threatened Durazzo. This action by the British Navy will have a far-reaching impact on the war in Albania. If the left wing of the Greek army can advance along the coast into the narrow lowlands between Valona and Durazzo, their progress may be faster than their advance in the mountainous region between Pogradec and Elbasan. It would also be able to encircle and cut off the entire Italian defense system, consuming far less manpower and time than simply forcing the Italian army to retreat on that line. The results achieved would have a greater impact on the outcome of the war. (21st dispatch from Reuters)

Cairo: It was stated here yesterday that British mechanized units broke through the outer fortifications of Bardia. After fierce fighting, they reached Bardia's inner defense line last night. The communique stated that there are still 30,000 elite Italian troops inside the defense line, including a rearguard "dare-to-die corps." They are now trapped and will either die or surrender. It is reported that British artillery is advancing towards the suburbs of Bardia because the city provides access west to Tobruk. (21st dispatch from the International News Service)

Cairo: News received here last night stated that British mechanized units operating around Bardia are charging into the outer perimeter of the Italian defenses. The Italian defenses form an arc around the port of Bardia, 15 miles long. The Italian garrison trapped in the port is resisting the British attacks with all their might. The British offensive against Bardia is intensifying and has reached its third day, creating a state of encirclement. The Italian garrison is well-equipped and trying to resist to the end. There is no news of Italian Commander-in-Chief General Graziani planning to send troops from Tobruk along the coastal road to reinforce Bardia. However, a military spokesman told Reuters reporters last night that if the enemy attempts to send troops to reinforce along this road, they will be met with a head-on blow by the British forces that have already cut off this coastal road. Furthermore, the Italian army's most important transportation line is now under the strict surveillance of British air force reconnaissance planes. If there is any movement, British eight-gun fighter planes can fly in and launch a fierce attack. (21st dispatch from Reuters)

Cairo: According to the latest news from the Western Desert, British forces are currently preparing to launch a fierce attack on Bardia, a key Italian stronghold in Libya. Although the exact deployment of Italian forces is unknown, according to reports from British outposts, Italian General Bardi and part of the 10th Army are currently surrounded in the village. The most formidable defense of the Italian army consists of many howitzers. The desert climate is extremely cold with strong winds. (21st dispatch from Reuters)

Cairo: A British government spokesman claimed yesterday that Italian forces are intensifying pressure on British troops attempting to capture Bardia. This can be seen from the continuous arrival of fresh Fascist troops at the front lines. The spokesman also stated that the Italian army's strong resistance to defend Bardia is not without reason, because the town has treacherous terrain and is fortified with all modern defensive weaponry, making it easy to defend. (21st dispatch from the United Press)

British Reconnaissance Planes Show Great Fearlessness in Gathering Enemy Intelligence

London: A Reuters correspondent in the Western Egyptian Desert reported that British reconnaissance pilots, who flew to Italian-held Libya to assist the British offensive in North Africa, recently told reporters about the British attack on Bardia. They said that reconnaissance aircraft flying into enemy territory in Libya are like the eyes of the British army. These planes show great fearlessness, taking accurate films and constantly informing the British commander of the deployment of Italian defenses in Bardia. Therefore, the British were able to formulate British tactics based on the strength and weakness of the enemy defenses. The main road from Bardia to Tobruk has been thoroughly destroyed by the British Air Force. Italian vehicles and soldiers have to risk traveling along the coastal road. The Italians previously transported many anti-aircraft guns from Solum to Bardia, but the British Air Force that flew to Bardia the previous two nights did not encounter anti-aircraft fire, indicating that these anti-aircraft guns have already been moved. The continuous supply of the British vanguard is greatly aided by the Air Force. In addition to launching attacks, British aircraft also engage in communication and fly to Bardia to distribute leaflets, urging the Italian defenders to surrender, saying "Resistance is useless, you will only die in vain." On Wednesday, a British patrol advanced to probe the defenses of Bardia and encountered slight resistance. The British army did not launch a fierce attack, leaving it to the British Air Force to bomb it heavily. (21st dispatch from Reuters)

Maritime Traffic in the Mediterranean Under British Naval Control

London: Britain has extended the war to the Italian coast. After launching fierce attacks on Italian strongholds, the British fleet has proven that it completely controls the Mediterranean (which the Italians call "Our Sea") and can move freely in the Adriatic Sea (which Mussolini calls the "Inland Sea") without any obstruction. The heel of southern Italy is only 40 miles from Valona, the most important Italian supply port in Albania. However, when the British Navy bombarded the port, the Italian Navy and aircraft did not dare to engage. (21st dispatch from Reuters)

Soviet Newspaper Praises British Military Achievements in North Africa

Moscow: Colonel Kononenko, a well-known Soviet commentator, published an article in the "Red Fleet" newspaper today, praising the British military achievements in North Africa. He wrote that the British army has already defeated at least two Italian army corps on this front, accounting for half of the total number of Italian troops on that front. The coordination of the British staff in adjusting the land, sea, and air forces in the Western Desert to attack the Italian army is impressive. The British naval superiority can not only prevent the Italians from sending reinforcements, but also enable the British army to land behind the Italian lines and launch a pincer attack. British military operations in Africa may later affect the Italian struggle in Europe. (21st dispatch from Reuters)

Random Thoughts on the European War (20) (6)

### The British Queen at the Front Lines

At the beginning of the German Air Force's Blitz on Britain, the King and Queen also entered an air raid shelter. At that time, there were about forty people hiding from the air raids in the basement of a police station. Suddenly, the King and Queen arrived, and everyone was surprised. Some people had to bring out tea that they didn't want others to see and offer it to the royal presence, but the King and Queen chatted and laughed with everyone as if nothing had happened, until the all-clear was sounded.

During wartime, their trips are not publicly announced in advance, so there are fewer people welcoming them. They are accompanied by only one or two people, perhaps the local mayor or the chairman of the city council. Everything is simpler than in peacetime, making them seem more approachable. As a result, the Queen's true face, such as her graceful demeanor and amiable nature, becomes even more apparent. Photographers often fail to capture the Queen's image to her satisfaction because no one can accurately convey her true self. In fact, her skin is flawless and radiant, making her beautiful enough. This fact is now widely known because everyone who sees her can appreciate it.

Life within the royal family has also been greatly affected by the war. In the past, the King and his brothers were often together, while the Queen spent more time with Queen Mary. Now, Queen Mary often lives in the countryside. Before the war broke out, she had already retired to allow the King and Queen to operate with fewer constraints. The Duke of Gloucester and the Duke of Kent and their families are mostly not in London. The men each have public duties - the Duke of Gloucester has served with the army in France, while the Duke of Kent serves in the Air Force and Navy. After the outbreak of the war, the King ordered that all royal attire be changed to military uniforms, and stated that he would only wear his naval uniform and no other clothing.

In addition, the King travels more often during the war than in peacetime. In the past, the King and Queen always stayed together wherever they went. Now, the King often travels alone to inspect airfields, naval ports, and military stations for several days at a time. The Queen does not often visit the military, unless she is the honorary commander of the unit. That being said, because of her position, she sees more troops than any other woman.

Finally, the British royal family has also personally experienced the evacuation of children. Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret Rose were evacuated from London at the beginning of the war. The Queen sometimes cannot see them for weeks at a time. She, like many other mothers living in London, worries about the safety of her children when there is no air raid alert in London, but other parts of Britain are constantly being bombed by German planes.

Banquets at Buckingham Palace have been completely stopped. The number of palace staff has also been reduced to a minimum due to military service. One of the Queen's permanent secretaries has now enlisted in the army, and his duties have been taken over by the deputy secretary, who also has a military position in London. If there are any banquets in the palace, they are held during the day, like everywhere else, and lunch is served instead. Because at night, blackouts and transportation difficulties make everything inconvenient.

Prime Minister Churchill visits the palace once a week. Other ministers, especially those who are newly appointed and younger, visit less often. (They are often treated to lunch, so that the King and the ministers can have closer contact.) There are few other guests for lunch, and the intervals between visits are long. The Queen's relatives who are serving in the military in London often visit the palace, as do her old friends. The meals at these lunches are very simple, only about three courses. Of course, like ordinary people, the palace also practices food rationing for all daily necessities. The King's allotment is even less than that of a soldier.

The palace holds a sewing circle every week, presided over by the Queen, but this circle has been canceled since the Blitz began. The Queen does some knitting herself, making socks, scarves, and other small items for the troops. The Queen is very enthusiastic about participating in various charitable organizations, but she does not want people to know the details. She does her best to help with relief efforts in her hometown of Scotland. As for other charities, countless of them have benefited from her. (End)

The Throne Room of Buckingham Palace

One Glimpse of the Bombing of Buckingham Palace

hopes to see Laval live in Paris as a fugitive for a long time, feeling that Laval is a useful tool for the Germans and must not be allowed to participate in the Vichy cabinet. Undoubtedly, the Germans would not hesitate to inflict this kind of shame on the Vichy government again, using this as a lesson that peace has not yet been signed. In addition, there are several other possibilities that can explain the crisis that Vichy is currently trying to cope with by holding a meeting, such as the positions of General Weygand or the French army in Algiers and Morocco. However, more accurate news has not yet been released, so various discussions are of course purely speculative. (21st dispatch from Reuters)

German Border: The repeated meetings of the Vichy cabinet must be due to new developments in Franco-German relations, and the reasons for this development are Laval's dismissal and German Ambassador Abetz's visit. According to news from Vichy, Marshal Pétain and Foreign Minister Flandin are willing to comply with Abetz's request to make Franco-German economic relations closer and give Italy the suspicion of being their protectorate. There is speculation here that Italy may be willing to make peace alone and make General Badoglio Italy's Pétain. These speculations are far from the truth, but they are still widely discussed. The return of US Ambassador to Italy Phillips to Rome can be seen as very meaningful, perhaps because the United States also recognizes that Italy may one day need to negotiate peace. People here feel that the German talk of advancing into Italy via the Brenner Pass or through French territory is intentionally spread by Germany, with the aim of weakening the British preparations to defend against a German invasion of Britain.

Vichy: French Minister of the Interior Belin ordered the dissolution of the special police force protecting Marshal Pétain today. The force included 1,200 people. When Laval was dismissed last week, the force was stationed at the Hôtel du Parc. (21st dispatch from Haitong)

### Free French Expose Laval's Treasonous Activities

London: The Free French News Agency stated that former Vichy Foreign Minister Laval has indeed accepted a German plan to assist Italy in resisting Greece and to make Franco-German cooperation closer than before. This includes German troops passing through French territory to Italy and allowing German submarine forces in the Mediterranean to use bases in southern France. The Vichy cabinet rejected this plan. Laval then suggested that Marshal Pétain go to Paris and then to Versailles, so that he could persuade him of the need to establish a government in the capital. If so, the government would be under the direct control of the Germans and there would be no possibility of continued resistance. Laval not only prepared to risk war against Britain, but also told the Vichy government that it must take this risk, and that it must utilize the remaining resources of France in order to establish the Franco-German alliance on a relatively equal footing.

### Rome Increasingly Uneasy About the Nature of Franco-German Talks

Rome: The Italian official news agency issued a statement last night stating that Italy has received very little information about the Franco-German talks. However, the Italian side believes that these talks are related to issues that directly affect Franco-German relations. The absolute unity of the Axis powers is an established fact and does not need to be reiterated every time. This is especially true because Franco-German negotiations are limited to issues that directly affect these two countries. In fact, this statement reflects Italy's unease about the Franco-German talks. (21st dispatch from Reuters)

### France Plans to Establish a New Parliament by Recruiting Talents from All Walks of Life

Vichy: The French Pétain government's three departments of foreign affairs, internal affairs, and justice are currently jointly reviewing the new constitution, hoping to establish a new French parliament. It is stipulated that there will be 460 members in total, half of whom will be selected by the government from former senators, and the rest will be filled by representatives from the French industrial, commercial, and labor classes.

### Vichy's Status Remains Ambiguous and Uncertain; Rumors Suggest Germany Made Three Demands, Exerting Significant Pressure on Pétain

London - The status of Vichy remains ambiguous and uncertain, but there is no doubt that the Pétain government is facing serious issues. The continued holding of cabinet meetings indicates that significant developments are brewing. However, concrete information is not yet available, so the issues currently being considered by the French government can only be speculated upon. British newspapers point out that the following three issues are likely the reason for the continuous meetings of the Vichy government: (1) the Germans demand the use of French ports in the Mediterranean; (2) the Germans demand permission for German troops to pass through Italy; (3) the Germans demand the reinstatement of Laval into the cabinet, though not necessarily to his original position. Regarding the first point, if the Germans can sail their warships into the Mediterranean, then Italian bases are available for their use. Therefore, it is doubtful whether the Germans can gain much benefit from French harbors. Regarding the second point, Germany's intention is likely to occupy northern Italy to prevent the complete collapse of Italian resistance. The possibility of the Italian army collapsing is now more credible than before. As for the reinstatement of Laval, the Germans do not seem satisfied with Laval's release from prison. However, Pétain will reject German demands that exceed the armistice agreement. Pétain's reliance is on General Weygand in Africa. It is said that Pétain has agreed to concessions to Abetz, such as the release of Brinon (rumored to be imprisoned with Laval) and appointing him as the French representative in the occupied territories. The Germans seem to know that Laval is too discredited and that his reinstatement would not help the Germans. Therefore, they chose Brinon instead. However, the Franco-German situation may not change much at present. Germany already controls French industry. If Germany makes military demands, it risks forcing Pétain to resign and causing General Weygand to take up arms against Germany in Africa. It is widely believed that Pétain will not allow German troops to pass through Italy. If Germany forces this, it will risk losing more than it gains due to the attitude of French colonies. Regarding the unconfirmed news that German troops have entered Italy, based on German reports, the Nazis are quite troubled by the difficulty of how to aid Italy, as sending a large army into Italy is not welcomed by the Italian people.

New York - Roosevelt announced yesterday that the new U.S. Ambassador to France, Admiral Leahy, will depart for Europe on the 23rd, carrying a letter from himself to Pétain, to be personally presented to the French head of state. (Haitong News Agency, 21st)

Washington - President Roosevelt told reporters yesterday that the position of U.S. Ambassador to Britain has not been filled since Kennedy resigned. His plan to lend war equipment to Britain must be approved by Congress to be implemented, but the Johnson Act does not need to be repealed. The new Ambassador to France, Leahy, is carrying a personal letter to Marshal Pétain. Leahy is an old friend of Pétain, and he is certain that Leahy will be welcomed by Pétain, he said. The President mentioned the issue of bases in the Caribbean leased from Britain, saying that existing rumors criticize the lack of immediate progress in preparations. In reality, only Trinidad, Bermuda, and Mayaguana are awaiting decisions. (Reuters, 21st)

### Germany Sends Secret Police to Monitor Vichy's Actions

London - The Free French News Agency claims that Germany fears that the pressure it is now applying to the Vichy government will create a situation that Pétain and others cannot withstand and will have to flee to North Africa. Therefore, it has sent more secret police to Vichy and stationed them at French ports and airfields. The Nazis also fear that French Africa will break away from the Vichy government, so they are proceeding cautiously. However, they are determined to oppose the few people around Pétain who are still gathered against Laval.

### Italy Uses German Giant Aircraft to Transport Troops to Reinforce the Albanian Front; Fierce Battles Along the Coast; No Change in the Northern Battlefield

Athens - Yesterday's front-line news reported that Greek soldiers drove the Italian army out of Tepeleni and Këlcyrë and advanced north. (United Press, 21st)

Rome - According to reliable sources, for several weeks, Italy has been using German giant aircraft to transport reinforcements to Albania, averaging 3,000 people per day. The Italian army is also transporting new "Fiat" tanks to the Albanian front. Observers generally believe that Italy's rapid reinforcement is the reason for the halt in the Greek offensive over the past week. Regarding the front-line battles, reports from front-line reporters here state that Italian pilots are currently facing extreme difficulties because heavy snow has obscured all military targets and Greek army movements, so Italian aircraft bombing is ineffective. Reconnaissance aircraft must undertake most of the work, but air force activity in some areas must be completely suspended. Therefore, the recent heavy snow is quite beneficial to the Greek army. (United Press, 21st)

Athens - The weather has improved slightly, and Greek forces are more free to move in many areas along the 80-mile front in Albania. In the past 48 hours, Greek forces have advanced deeply in some areas of the front, opening the way for continued progress. The Greek people's determination to fight can be seen in some border areas yesterday. Because of heavy snowfall in many mountainous areas, some roads are at risk of being blocked. The Ministry of Public Security ordered strong men and women in the local area to help clear the accumulated snow on the roads. Before long, this work was completed. According to recent communiqués, Greek forces, disregarding enemy resistance, stormed and captured enemy positions, capturing more than 600 enemy soldiers and seizing many machine guns, etc. (Reuters, 21st)

Nanjing - According to reports in this newspaper, although the weather has been poor recently, the Italian-Greek front-line battles are still ongoing. The climate in the Lake Ohrid area in the northern part of the front is slightly better. Yesterday morning, artillery battles were extremely active. Italian and Greek forces had contact with each other. As far as the situation in that area is concerned, the positions of both sides have not changed. In the area along the Shkumbin River and the Devoll River, there were only small-scale battles. The Italian Air Force bombed the northern positions of the Greek army. According to news from the southern border of Nanjing, the battles in the southern part of the front have continued unabated until now. According to semi-official Greek news, fierce battles are currently taking place around Himara. After the Greek attack, they often encounter fierce counterattacks from the Italian army. In the Tepeleni area, both infantry and artillery were extremely active yesterday. The battle in Këlcyrë is still continuing. It is reported that Italy has sent fresh troops to the front-line headquarters, and the Greek army has also reinforced them to prevent an Italian advance. (Haitong News Agency, 21st)

Athens - The British Air Force communiqué issued here last night stated that the British aircraft attacked the ports of Vlorë and Klisura in Albania on Thursday. Vlorë was bombed, and bombs hit the barracks, gas depots, motor vehicle yards, and many buildings north of the city. When the British aircraft flew away, thick smoke rose from the barracks and gas depots. Many bombs also hit the Klisura area, and buildings caught fire. Although the British aircraft encountered resistance from enemy fighters and anti-aircraft fire, they all returned safely. (Reuters, 21st)

### German Aircraft Bombard Britain Madly; Merseyside Area Suffers Heaviest Damage; British Aircraft Raid Industrial Area in Western Germany at Night

London - Hitler's aircraft roared over Britain again last night, covering at least twelve areas of England, Scotland, and Wales. They concentrated their attacks on the Merseyside area, launching a sharp offensive on Liverpool until dawn today. It was also heard that before dawn, German aircraft attacked three towns in northeastern England. German aircraft dropped high-explosive bombs and incendiary bombs on the Merseyside area for several hours. This was the first air raid suffered by the area in three weeks. Official buildings, shops, residences, hotels, and restaurants were heavily damaged by the hail of bombs. It was also heard that there were very heavy casualties. The air raid on Merseyside seemed to be German aircraft following the strategy of German Aviation Minister Göring, wanting to turn this important British seaport into scorched earth to make up for the inadequacy of the submarines sent by Hitler. In addition, towns in the Midlands area were also attacked. In a certain rural area of the Midlands, a hospital was damaged when a bomb fell in a certain courtyard. Under the flying glass, two nurses and many patients were injured by the glass. However, there were no deaths or serious injuries. In addition to Liverpool, two towns in Merseyside were also severely bombed. It was heard that the large fires after the bombing in the Merseyside area were quickly extinguished. The air raid alarm in London lasted for several hours until dawn today. However, it was very quiet during the alarm, with only occasional intensive anti-aircraft fire. At 12:05 this morning, a town in the West Midlands, although fierce anti-aircraft fire was launched, bombs still landed. A town on the eastern coast was bombed with various caliber bombs, and the sound of artillery caused houses along the coast to be severely shaken. Countless teams of German aircraft flew north over the East Midlands last night, with one team flying over every minute, but they were all flying at extremely high altitudes. In addition, some towns in southwestern England, a certain town in East Anglia, western England, northwestern England, the West Midlands, and Wales were also overflown by German aircraft. Four bombs fell on a town in Scotland, one of which landed outside a public housing wall, but did not cause significant casualties. Another bomb caused minor property damage. (United Press, 21st)

London - The Royal Air Force issued a communiqué yesterday stating that the Royal Air Force flew to the Ruhr area in western Germany on Thursday night and bombed the oil refineries, power plants, and railway junctions there. The communiqué stated, "In the Duisburg area, two large fires broke out. Our pilots witnessed the gasoline targets in Cologne igniting a large fire. Our aircraft also dropped bombs on anti-aircraft gun positions. Our aircraft continued to bomb Essen and Bonn and returned safely to their defenses." (United Press, 21st)

### Halifax Said to Be Appointed Ambassador to the United States; Eden to Succeed as Foreign Secretary; Lloyd George May Join Cabinet

London - Informed sources here are now saying that the successor to the British Ambassador to the United States will be the current Foreign Secretary, Lord Halifax. Halifax was previously the Viceroy of India and is now in charge of foreign affairs. He has served for many years, has rich experience, and knows the entire war situation in great detail. Therefore, he is qualified for the position of ambassador to the United States. If Halifax accepts this position, then the cabinet will definitely be slightly reorganized. Lloyd George, who served as Prime Minister during the Great War, may join the War Cabinet in a non-ministerial capacity, which is also within expectations. (Haitong News Agency, 21st)

London - It is widely believed that if Halifax does indeed take up the post of Ambassador to the United States, then the current Secretary of War, Eden, will succeed Halifax as Foreign Secretary. As for Eden's current position, it will be succeeded by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, Hudson. (United Press, 21st)

### Soviet-Japanese Relations Have Never Been Cordial and Friendly; Japanese Newspaper Opposes Pro-Soviet Stance, Saying It Will Cause Northern Turmoil

Tokyo - The Miyako Shimbun editorial advocates that Japan should closely monitor the Soviet Union's attitude, saying that the Japanese authorities must know at this time that if they continue to express a pro-Soviet stance, it will inevitably cause turmoil in the north. The Russo-Japanese War in the past was caused by the pro-Russian atmosphere in Japan. The Soviet Union now wants to compete with Japan for the leadership of the Pacific, which the Japanese should never forget. Although many people believe that Japan and the Soviet Union are maintaining friendly relations due to the Three-Power Pact and the close relations between Germany and the Soviet Union, this view cannot be considered well-founded. In fact, this view has dangerous consequences. The Soviet Union, like China, is Japan's neighbor and is always worthy of Japan's serious attention from a diplomatic and military standpoint. Since the Russo-Japanese War, the relations between the two countries have seemed peaceful, but in reality, they have never been cordial and friendly. It would be rash to assume that Japanese-American relations have already improved because the Soviet Union is now helping countries that intend to create a new world order to a certain extent. (Reuters, 21st)

### Havas News Agency Bought by French Government; Transferred to the Jurisdiction of the Intelligence Bureau

Vichy - Yesterday, the French Official Gazette published a new law stipulating that the French Intelligence Bureau's domestic and foreign news agency, the Havas News Agency, which was purchased by the government, has been transferred to the bureau. The first clause of the new law states that the mission of the new bureau is to collect and supply news to domestic and foreign countries. This public enterprise will be registered in accordance with civil law, and its economy must be independent. The Intelligence Bureau is supervised by cabinet members. Under the director of the bureau, there is an editorial committee and a management committee. The former has seven members who provide opinions on domestic and foreign political issues. The members are the director of the Intelligence Bureau, the director of the Government Information Office, and representatives from the Prime Minister, Foreign Affairs, Interior, Finance, and Colonial Ministries. The editorial committee meets at least once a week. (Haitong News Agency, 21st)

### U.S. Protests Radio Interference; Japanese Consul Delays Reply; Only Says Understanding Can Be Reached in a Few Days; Radio Stations Still Experience Interference as Before

The Japanese interference with the broadcasts of the American-owned China Federal Radio Station has not decreased yesterday (the 21st), and the Japanese Consulate General has delayed replying to the U.S. protest regarding this matter. According to a spokesman for the Japanese Consulate, the matter is still under consideration, but an "resolution" is expected within a few days.

Radio Station Knows Nothing

The spokesman declined to disclose what the resolution would be, saying only that Japanese officials are currently doing their best to bring the matter to an end. The China Federal Radio Station denies any knowledge of the "resolution." It is said that if any talks have been held to seek a compromise solution to inspect the news broadcasts of the radio station, the China Federal Radio Station has not been consulted.

No Indication of Retaliation

The interference was caused by a Japanese warship in the Huangpu River. The day before yesterday (the 20th), the interference intensified, further disrupting the shortwave broadcasts of the China Federal Radio Station, but not very severely. The broadcasts at the 650 frequency are still quite clear, but the broadcasts at the 600 and 630 frequencies are disrupted and cannot be heard. Yesterday, it was still rumored that if this interference does not stop immediately, the China Federal Radio Station intends to disrupt the broadcasts of the two Japanese radio stations in the city in retaliation. The China Federal Radio Station has remained silent on this matter, refusing to confirm or deny it.

Convention Stipulates Mutual Compliance

International conventions stipulate the frequencies and wavelengths used by radio stations. The frequency of transmission must remain permanently unchanged and must not interfere with the work of other radio stations. If more than one frequency is designated for transmission, the section of the band that does not interfere with the work of other nearby radio stations must be selected when in use. If interference is discovered and a request is received from another radio station for the first time, transmission should be stopped immediately and the frequency changed.

Intentional Interference Strictly Punished

In addition, all radio stations should pay attention to avoiding mutual interference when working. The above conventions are stipulated in the latest articles of the 1940 International Telecommunication Regulations. If a radio station violates the above conventions, it can be reported to the government for this illegal action by the radio operator after a warning is given and the interference continues to occur. Therefore, the Japanese side's interference with the radio station owned by the American company using the same frequency and wavelength clearly violates international radio regulations, and the international community should strictly punish it to maintain law and order.

### Shanghai's Difficult Living Conditions Worry the National Government; Hope for Mutual Assistance between Labor and Capital

Shanghai's environment is special, with active speculation in the market and attempts to raise prices secretly, hence the name "black market." However, this type of trading is purely illegal. Now, due to these people's deliberate hoarding, prices of various commodities are rising without falling, and the cost of living index is disrupted. The general salaried class and ordinary people are feeling a severe threat. It is learned that the National Government is concerned about the frequent rise in prices in Shanghai and the difficult living conditions of the citizens. If no effective measures are taken to suppress prices, the future of social security is unimaginable. It now strongly hopes that workers in all industries will understand the difficult situation and take the overall situation into consideration, and not take any excessive actions. It also hopes that capitalists will consider the livelihood of workers and embrace a spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation. At the same time, it has decided to order all industries to thoroughly investigate hoarding and speculation. If it is found to be true after investigation, it will report to the authorities so that the relevant parties can be authorized to severely punish them. If all industries can strictly report and stabilize prices, it will not be difficult to solve the problem. The so-called increased costs and expensive prices are just excuses, which the citizens must clearly recognize.

### German Ambassador Trautmann Still Resides Peacefully in Berlin; Absolutely Untrue That He Came to China to Go to Chongqing

Recently, rumors of "peace" have resurfaced in various markets in this city, saying that German Ambassador to China Trautmann has come to China to go to Chongqing to mediate the Sino-Japanese War. Yesterday morning, a reporter from the Dazhong News Agency visited Mr. Code, the information commissioner of the German Embassy, ​​to inquire about the recent whereabouts of Ambassador Trautmann and the situation in the Far East. According to Mr. Code, the ambassador is still living peacefully in Berlin and has not stepped out of the country or prepared to come to China. All the rumors are obviously unfounded. Regarding the evolution of the situation in the Far East, the famous German authoritative diplomatic commentator Karl Meger recently published a commentary entitled "Alien Elements in East Asia," which has accurate insights into the situation in the Far East and incisive analysis and observation on the future of the Sino-Japanese War. German officials and bookstores in various countries attach great importance to this thesis. It is now planned to find a way to send the original work to Shanghai for reference by those who care about the situation in the Far East.

European War Films Continue to Be Shown

Since Germany screened the European War film at the German Primary School on Dasi Road in Shanghai, hundreds of people from all walks of life have gone to the embassy to request admission tickets every day. According to Mr. Code, he told reporters that he was very sorry to those who requested tickets by mail and did not receive them. He is now actively arranging to continue the screening as soon as the work is completed. The previously mailed admission tickets can also be sent out as soon as possible. It is also heard that new films on the recent situation in the European War are also on their way to China. As soon as they arrive, all sectors of society will be invited to visit on a regular basis.

### Continued House Demolition on Wangjia Lane by the Japanese; Japanese Spokesperson Claims Nothing of the Sort; 土山灣 Area Blockaded Again Yesterday

The Japanese authorities in the Shanghai West District, in order to build "Sasaki Road" from the middle section of Great West Road to Yuyuan Road to commemorate the Japanese military policeman who was shot dead at the entrance of Lane 52 of Great West Road three weeks ago, caused another 200 Chinese people to become homeless yesterday (the 21st). Most of those affected by the Japanese road construction plan are shop owners and shops located at the entrance of Wangjia Lane. At the same time, a small number of houses in the lane were also demolished yesterday. Although the Japanese official spokesperson stated at a reception for reporters the night before that rumors of residents in the lane becoming homeless or houses being demolished were untrue, people witnessed a large number of houses in the lane being demolished yesterday morning. At the same time, people living in the lane were also moving their furniture and sundries.

Japanese Spokesperson Denies Everything

The Continental Daily News reported that the Japanese Army spokesperson, when hosting news reporters yesterday afternoon (the 20th), firmly denied the Japanese side demolishing 50 Chinese houses to open a road at the site where the Japanese military policeman was assassinated, causing 300 Chinese residents to become homeless. According to a news report published in an evening newspaper earlier this week, the Japanese authorities had demolished a row of Chinese houses between Great West Road and Yuyuan Road in order to build a road to commemorate the assassinated Japanese military policeman.

Strict Security at the Border of the Concession

Yesterday, the situation in Shanghai's West District did not change much. Areas such as Zhuanbang Yongxingli were still in a state of semi-blockade. The two blockades at the southern end of Great West Road Yidingpan Road and the intersection of Great West Road Jing'an Temple Road still cut off all traffic. Demolition work in and around Wangjia Lane continued unabated. Public buses on lines 1, 2, 9, and 3 sold tickets in two sections, and the route signs for the double-decker buses had also been modified. As for the Caojiadu area, barbed wire was everywhere, but no blockade measures were taken. In addition, the security lines set up by the Public Works Department at the border of the Shanghai West District Concession, such as the intersections of Fuxu Road and Haig Road, Jing'an Temple Road and Haig Road, Avenue Haig and Jessfield Road, and Jiaozhou Road and Singapore Road, were quite strict in searching pedestrians and vehicles. Given the winter defense period, there was deep concern that troublemakers would sneak into the Concession, and Shanghai West District was a troublesome area, so all possible suppression methods had to be taken to prevent unexpected events from happening. West of Haig Road, along Great West Road to Yidingpan Road, special businesses such as small gambling houses, small flower clubs, and telephone rooms sprung up like mushrooms after rain, almost filling the alleys.

Barbed Wire Also Set Up in 土山灣

土山灣 in Xujiahui, Shanghai West District, is the only important route between the French Concession and Caohejing, Minhang, Qibao, and Xinzhuang. Farmers from the suburbs travel to and from there, so the area is very lively. Unexpectedly, starting yesterday morning, the Japanese side suddenly erected barbed wire at the throat of Lane 735 of Pudong Road in 土山灣, strictly searching pedestrians. Small business people carrying various goods were subjected to even stricter inspections. Any goods that the Japanese army deemed to be prohibited were banned from entering or leaving.

### 聯美 Airlines Opens New Hong Kong-Singapore Route

China's transportation construction has made rapid progress since the war. The construction of international highways on land has received great attention, and the opening of overseas air routes has also been carefully managed. It is reported that 聯美 Airlines is planning to open new routes from Manila to Hong Kong and from Manila to Singapore in order to develop its Far East business, with two flights scheduled every week.

The extension of this route can provide the rapid transportation tools needed for the United States to expand its Eastern business. The company has obtained the permission of the British side for all necessary conveniences. The opening of this new route will not only facilitate transportation, but also indicate that the US government and business community both advocate maintaining a strong position in the Far East.

### Knitwear Engineers Go on Strike; Workers Anxious and Uneasy

More than 300 engineers and technicians from more than 120 knitting factories in the city have asked their respective factories to increase wages and improve treatment due to financial difficulties. Wages were approved to be increased by 60%, rice subsidies were five斗 per month, and living allowances were 30 yuan per person per month. At 2 pm the day before yesterday, the Political Department of the Public Concession invited both labor and management to mediate once, but in the end, the labor side was afraid that the management had other intentions, and did not agree because the management required work to resume first, and then direct negotiations would take place. As a result, the matter could not be resolved satisfactorily. The dispute was still deadlocked yesterday, causing all electric knitting factories in the city to shut down completely. It is reported that in addition to trying to maintain order and waiting for a reasonable solution, the labor side is also discussing countermeasures. According to an engineer, their monthly salary is only 50 yuan, which is only enough to feed themselves at a time when everything is expensive and the cost of living has doubled. It is difficult to support their families, so they have no choice but to take this action. Therefore, they hope that the management will follow the spirit of cooperation between labor and management in the past and grant them allowances and salary increases. At present, more than 30,000 male and female workers from more than 120 electric knitting factories in the city are quite anxious and uneasy.

The Shanghai Postal Administration is currently issuing postage stamps that are still in the old format and old values.

### Unapproved Banknotes Prohibited from Acceptance and Circulation; Violators Will Be Prosecuted for Disrupting the Financial Order; Offenders Will Be Sent to Military Tribunals for Severe Punishment

Since China implemented the new monetary policy, banknotes issued by the Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China have been designated as legal tender. All grain payments, tax payments, and all public and private transactions must be made in legal tender. Banknotes issued by Zhejiang Xing, Siming, and other banks that were previously approved for issuance are temporarily allowed to circulate as usual, but they are gradually being exchanged for legal tender by the Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China. The issuance, circulation, and exchange of legal tender is handled by the Issuance Reserve Management Committee to ensure its soundness and build confidence. As for banks that have not been approved to issue banknotes, they are absolutely not allowed to issue them without authorization.

### Fufeng Flour Mill Resumed Operations Yesterday; Most Workers Automatically Returned to the Factory

The Fufeng Flour Mill at 126 Moshan Road in Shanghai has a long history and a large scale, with more than 1,000 workers. Recently, the workers of the factory went on strike due to dissatisfaction with their treatment. The details of the incident have been reported in detail in this newspaper. It is now learned that the treatment of the workers in the factory has always been good. Each person can purchase a bag of Old Car brand flour for only 4.5 yuan per month, and 65 pounds of white rice (equivalent to 3斗7升) for only 2.85 yuan. Therefore, the minimum salary for each person is 70 yuan, with double pay at the end of the year. If business is booming, special rewards are also given. The factory has also built a large shouting building and dozens of workers' residences, and has a hospital and a school for workers' children to protect the workers, provide free medical treatment for workers and their families, and educate their children. Generally speaking, this is rare. Moreover, as the source of wheat has become scarce recently, the factory, in order to maintain the lives of the workers, has long saved a considerable amount of flour and rice as a precaution. If the source of wheat is cut off one day and the factory is forced to shut down, the workers will still be able to eat specially priced rice and flour as usual, and their wages will be paid as usual. As for the strike, most of the workers understand the big picture, so 600 people unconditionally and automatically returned to the factory to resume operations yesterday (the 21st). Other workers have not yet learned of the resumption of operations because they live far away from the factory, so they have not come to the factory. The factory is also being generous and will not pursue any responsibility for the workers who have resumed operations. Therefore, the strike at the factory should be completely resolved within a few days.

### All Circles Warmly Celebrate National Revival Day; Promote Frugality, Savings, and Disaster Relief Movement; But No Commemorative Ceremonies Will Be Held

The 25th of this month is the anniversary of the Yunnan Uprising and National Revival Day. All circles in Shanghai will celebrate the Yunnan Uprising, which overthrew the imperial conspiracy and restored the national foundation, and the resolution of the Xi'an Incident, the safe return of the supreme leader to Beijing, and the promotion of national unity. However, no commemorative ceremonies will be held. In order to support national policies and complete the great cause of national revival, all circles have decided to step up the promotion of frugality, savings, and national construction movements, reduce expenditures, and provide for national construction needs. In view of the fact that it is winter and the poor people on the streets are suffering from hunger and cold and dying in large numbers, and at a time when various charities are promoting winter relief, they will expand their support to provide relief. The authorities of the two concessions, in order to prevent troublemakers from taking the opportunity to cause trouble, have decided to implement a day of alert to prevent such incidents.

The committee is dedicated to discussing the election of directors and has held five meetings so far. According to a report from the 平明社 reporter to informed sources, the committee is scheduled to hold its sixth meeting next Tuesday (the 24th of this month) at 4 pm. The meeting place is still the Board of Directors meeting room on the first floor of the Municipal Council.

However, the system is based on the 洋涇浜 Land Charter, so it is difficult to achieve the wish to reform the election system.

### Public Buses' Daily Revenue Nearly 70,000 After Fare Increase

After the British Public Bus Company implemented the third fare increase on the 17th of this month due to increased employee subsidies and material prices, the burden on citizens has increased, and the company's business has become more developed.

The Japanese army twice went out of Xiaoshan a few months ago, attempting to occupy Shaoxing. Residents in the surrounding urban and rural areas had previously suffered from drought, floods, plague, and rice shortages. After being harassed by the Japanese army, their lives became even more difficult. Representatives were repeatedly sent to Shanghai to appeal to the Shaoxing Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association for relief. The association immediately organized the 29 Emergency Relief Association, initiated by Pei Yunqing, Zhu Xinpei, and others, and raised 600,000 yuan, which has been fully remitted to Shaoxing for emergency relief. The 29 Emergency Relief Association ended last month and another Shaoxiao Disaster Relief Association was formed, raising more than 300,000 yuan, which has also been remitted to Shaoxing.

The Shaoxiao Disaster Relief Association, in order to provide relief to its hometown, has launched a one-yuan fundraising campaign to the Shanghai fellow villagers, divided into three phases, with 100,000 yuan raised in each phase. It is estimated that after 300,000 yuan has been raised, it will be remitted to Shaoxing.

### Trafficking Case Continues to Recover Nine Children in Xiamen; Recovered by the Main Criminal Su Desan; Three More Children Hope Their Families Will Identify Them

Xie Wanfang, the Chinese Inspector of the General Inspectorate of the Public Concession Police Department, Ji Ronggui, the Chinese Head Constable, and Zhang Decai, the investigator of the Jiaxing Road Police Station, broke up an organization specializing in trafficking children in Shanghai, Xiamen, and other places a few months ago. They arrested Su Desan, Chen Jiabai, and other seven or eight people, the leaders of the gang. It was found that Su and others had trafficked no less than several white children. In addition to the dozens of young children who have been recovered one after another, the investigators have taken the criminals to Xiamen to identify and lead the way.

The investigators recovered nine more young children, including: (1) Zhang Xuda, the six-year-old son of Zhang Amao at No. 2, Lane 218, Fuxu Road; (2) Jin Jiliang, the five-year-old son of Jin Xianlong at No. 183, North Henan Road; (3) Li Qingding, the five-year-old son of Li Achao at No. 15, Lane 120, Kaifeng Road; (4) Lin Miaojin, the six-year-old son of Lin Chaozhen at No. 45, Hongchenli, Wuzhou Road; (5) Ada, the six-year-old son of Shen Zhanyu at No. 169, Berle Road; (6) Zhang Shuifu, the seven-year-old son of Zhang Aneng at No. 1, Fuqingli, Fuyou Road; and

It is truly a heinous crime. Feng, the judge of the Special First Court, opened the court to hear the case yesterday morning. Ru Baoyi, the police lawyer, requested

Severe punishment in accordance with the law. After Judge Feng asked the families of each child, he ordered a postponement of the trial. Each child with a family was allowed to be taken back to reunite, and the rest were temporarily left at the police station to wait for identification.

However, as soon as he entered and sat down, he began coughing and gasping for breath due to excessive drinking. Although the prostitute poured water on him in an attempt to help, it was ineffective. The owner of Han Village reported it to the police station and he was sent to the hospital, but he died before receiving treatment. The body was taken to the coroner's office. As there was no way to contact his family, a charitable organization arranged for the body to be collected and prepared for burial, awaiting identification. Yesterday, his family learned of the incident and went to the coroner's office to identify the body from photographs. They took the body back for burial. However, his family, concerned about the deceased's status and reputation, were unwilling to reveal his real name.

### Achievements of the National Medical People's Hospital

Since Wen Lanting, Guan Jiong, Huang Hanzhi, Xie Qian, Ding Jimin, and others founded the Shanghai National Medical People's Hospital, they have operated with dedication and have greatly benefited the poor and sick. In the past six months, the hospital has seen an average of 200 to 300 outpatients per day and over 100 inpatients per day. In total, over 50,000 people have received treatment. As a result, even with careful budgeting, the monthly expenses still amount to over 7,000 yuan. With the recent rise in prices, it has become even more difficult to manage. While the hospital is helping the poor and sick, it is also promoting traditional Chinese medicine. These achievements are commendable. The hospital has appealed to all sectors of society, hoping for guidance and support.

### Finance: Rumors Spread Widely; Gold Market Suddenly Experiences a Frenzied Surge; After Noon, Undisclosed Trading Causes Painful Covering of Short Positions; Transactions Reached 6,300 Yuan

Yesterday, the gold market’s official session was stable, operating only for a half-day in the morning because it was Saturday afternoon. The market hovered around 6,100 yuan. Because a certain gold firm first released gold and then re-entered the market, the US dollar exchange rate weakened, falling to 6,070 yuan, before surging to 6,145 yuan. Unexpectedly, rumors of a US-Japan conflict and a possible change in the Japanese cabinet suddenly arose. Exchange houses released gold, but the resurgence was thwarted. The morning session closed down a small ten yuan. After the closing bell, a surprising and dramatic change occurred. Rumors of a possible suspension of foreign exchange supply spread. Speculators seized the opportunity to buy, and sellers were caught off guard, leading to a frenzied surge. The price rose to 6,250 yuan. Undisclosed trading outside of the official session caused painful covering of short positions, with no end in sight. Transactions even reached 6,300 yuan. By evening, the price was 6,280 yuan. Although it appeared to fall, it was secretly trading up 170 yuan. The total trading volume in the morning session was six to seven thousand taels (excluding the afternoon off-exchange trading). A jewelry store sold 30 taels of cash to a certain silver firm at a price 34 yuan lower than the forward price. There was no switch trading. Buyers posted a premium of over 30 yuan to sellers. Jewelry gold rose five yuan in the afternoon, totaling 630 yuan. Customs gold and other items remained unchanged.

Off-Exchange Trading Surges by 200 Yuan

Initially, the market was lax due to the previous day's slump, and sentiment was scattered. A silver firm released 20 taels of gold at only 6,100 yuan. Subsequently, both the gold and silver firms stalled, and a securities firm also released 300 to 400 taels, causing the price to weaken further. The silver firms conducted 20 taels of internal trading, reporting a price of 6,070 yuan. Later, due to tightening exchange rates and bullish sentiment, a certain gold firm re-entered the market heavily, causing the price to rebound strongly. Silver firms entered 30 taels to gold firms, reporting a price of 6,145 yuan. Later, as the exchange rate lengthened, exchange houses began selling, and silver firms with long positions sold off, causing a sharp decline. Securities firms released 20 taels to silver firms, re-entering within the 100 yuan range, at 6,090 yuan. By noon, the market stabilized and changes were minimal. As a result, gold firms conducted 20 taels of internal trading at 6,100 yuan, the closing price for the day, down ten yuan from the previous session. There was no official market in the afternoon due to Saturday. However, due to widespread rumors that HSBC would no longer be listed and would suspend foreign exchange supply on Monday, the off-exchange market had many buyers but few sellers. Initially, trading opened at 6,150 yuan, with money exchange firms and securities firms entering the market. The price rose to 6,250 yuan. Although it declined slightly afterward, it was rumored that transactions reached as high as 6,300 yuan. The final seller was at 6,280 yuan. The half-day saw a fluctuation of 75 yuan. The cash price for gold from the gold dealers was over ten yuan lower than the official forward price and was being purchased at 50 yuan lower.

Jewelry Gold Exchange Rate Remains Slightly Elevated

The exchange rate for jewelry gold at silver shops was unchanged in the morning, but at 3:30 PM in the afternoon, it was increased by five yuan. Da Tong Hang revised its rate to 630 yuan. The new rates at Xin Tong Hang were similar to the previous price. Purchases were 30 yuan lower.

### Foreign Exchange Market Only Operates in the Morning, Resulting in a Dull Day

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no fluctuations in HSBC's listed rates. The undisclosed trading of British and American currencies resulted in American currency being flat and British currency being firm. Although Chinese merchants and speculators were influenced by market rumors and tended to buy, HSBC and a certain American bank supplied heavily, only temporarily tightening the market. The market soon returned to flat, and some Chinese banks came to the market to sell, which was absorbed by HSBC. However, the underlying trend was quite loose. Foreign banks traded American currency for the current month at 5.75 yuan. By the close, the market sentiment had stabilized somewhat. As a result, the British currency was 3 pence 59375, a slight loosening of 0.015625. The American currency was 5.71875 yuan, the same as the previous day's closing price.

Rumors Still Dominate

In the early morning, the London market was up 0.0625 for both near and far months, the New York silver price was flat, and the London spot gold price was stagnant. Exchange rates for British to American currency, Shanghai, etc., did not change. American to British currency was unchanged, to Shanghai fell three cents, to France there was no market. Central Bank's listed rates for various exchanges remained the same. Banks opened in the morning with spot selling prices of British currency at 3 pence 578125 and American currency at 5.78125 yuan, the same as the previous night's closing price. After opening, foreign banks were willing to sell, with Chinese banks such as the East Asia Bank and Japanese banks entering the market to buy. The price saw little change. The current month's American currency was trading at 5.71875 yuan. HSBC's listed rates were unchanged. The silver balancing tax was increased by 0.25 percent. After this, market sentiment was again stimulated by rumors, and speculators bought, softening the market. It was said that a British bank offered American currency for the current month at 5.6875 yuan. However, before long, HSBC and a certain American bank supplied the market, causing the trend to stabilize, and HSBC sold American currency for the current month to foreign banks at 5.6875 yuan. Then, seeing Chinese banks following suit, the price instead rose. HSBC and a certain American bank then re-entered the market to buy American currency for the current month at 5.71875 yuan, and foreign banks even traded American currency for the current month at 5.75 yuan. By noon, the prices for spot and current month's American currency were 5.7...875 yuan, 3 pence 59375, the next month's American 5.6875 yuan, 3 pence 578125. In the afternoon, there was no market due to Saturday. Compared to the previous day's close, American currency was unchanged for both spot and forward trading, while British currency slightly strengthened by 0....5625.

Hong Kong Market Sees Little Change: Hong Kong, 21st (Saturday) Dispatch: The exchange market opened flat this morning. Spot prices for British, Japanese, and Shanghai currencies were unchanged (spot price for Shanghai currency closed at 414 yuan yesterday). Spot price for American currency loosened by 0.06...5, to 23.75 yuan. At 10:30 AM, the market was flat, with no gains or losses. There was no market in the afternoon due to Saturday.

Tianjin Sees Contraction in British and American Currencies: Tianjin, 21st (Saturday) Dispatch: The exchange market opened flat this morning. London telegraphs tightened by 0.0046875, to 3 pence 96875. New York telegraphic transfers contracted by 0.0625, to 6.28125 yuan. Shanghai currency rose by 0.15 yuan, to 89.75 yuan. "Joint Currency" (联钞) traded at a discounted rate of 0.35 yuan in undisclosed trading, to 87.6 yuan.

### Foreign Currencies Also Rise Rapidly

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw bullish rumors flourish. The official and undisclosed markets even traded up to 6,300 yuan by evening. The British and American pound surged by 3.5 yuan. The British pound still trended sluggish, with the market price remaining flat. The American dollar note even rose to 18.25 yuan, a sharp increase of 0.82 yuan from the previous day. Demand for Hong Kong notes was not scarce, and the evening price was over 4.2 yuan. The supply and demand for Japanese and Korean notes remained balanced, and the market price remained flat. The former remained at 1.58 yuan, and the latter remained at 1.32 yuan.

### Coal: After Several Difficulties, Wenzhou Coal Finally Arrives

The price of charcoal has been increasing since the disruption of shipping from Wenzhou. Scarcity has made it more valuable. Traders, aware of the difficulty in obtaining supplies, intentionally hoarded it. Currently, inventories are depleted, and some businesses have goods, but no inventory to sell. Unexpectedly, a sailboat from Wenzhou recently arrived with 1,700 bundles of Grade A charcoal, after navigating through difficult conditions for two months. The baskets were badly damaged and the traders sold them off. Each bundle was priced at 23 yuan.

### Yarn and Cotton: Wild Fluctuations; Yarn Market Becomes More Eventful; Double Horse Cotton Falls Over 20 Yuan in the Morning, Then Suddenly Surges 30 Yuan in the Afternoon

The yarn market has become increasingly volatile. This situation is entirely due to differing perspectives between the long and short positions, resulting in conflicting sentiments and creating a pattern of rapid advances and retreats. The significant purchases by "foreign entities" certainly have their special meaning or strategy, acting quickly to enter and exit the market, which outsiders cannot discern. As for the market itself, insiders believe that actual sales cannot support the high prices. Lower-quality yarn prices are low, and most traders are abandoning them and even considering taking short positions. Small silver firms in the market are adept at speculation, buying when prices rise and selling when they fall. Therefore, any change creates a sense of panic. Based on this situation, unexpected developments may occur in the future. Today, 1,455 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.

The morning opening for Double Horse cotton was due to short selling in the afternoon. The prevailing opinion was bearish, with plans to buy after prices fell. Therefore, there were more sellers than buyers, weakening the market. The price was 1,345 yuan. Shortly after, it fell to 1,341 yuan. The long positions came out to compete, and news of a softening exchange rate gradually pushed the price up to 1,349 yuan. As prices rose, claims of no spot transactions emerged, and the short positions became active, slightly depressing the market. Unexpectedly, the "scalpers" on the trading floor, always eager to profit from market movements, took advantage of the opportunity to exert downward pressure and sell off, causing panic and a flood of selling orders. The market plummeted to 1,322 yuan, and buyers hesitated to participate. Suddenly, foreign traders arrived and bought several bales, causing the market to rebound sharply to 1,335 yuan. The momentum shifted from weak to strong, with few changes in position. The daily turnover was approximately 6,800 bales. The Double Horse 20s yarn price was about 20 yuan lower than the previous day.

Yarn Prices Soared 30 Yuan in the Afternoon: Yarn brokers at the Shanghai Yarn Exchange were scrambling to buy Double Horse cotton, spreading rumors that the off-exchange gold market had surged. As a result, buyers rushed in, pushing the Double Horse 20s yarn price up 20 yuan to 1,340 yuan, then to 1,355 yuan. At the Securities Exchange, the price was 1,358 yuan, and it finally reached 1,364.5 yuan. Finding the goods became like searching for treasure. The dramatic shift from the morning's coldness to such heat demonstrates the rapid changes in speculative sentiment.

### Tianjin Cotton Sales Gradually Increase

The spot cotton market remains quiet, with no major developments from the mills. However, as the yarn market continues to advance, the interconnected cotton market will inevitably be affected. Currently, the market remains stable.

Another report states that the price of foreign cotton on the New York cotton market initially rose due to buying pressure, but later fell due to selling from spot traders and profit-taking from some long positions. The closing price was down 1-2 pounds from the previous day. News from the Indian market has been delayed due to cable disruptions.

The Shanghai foreign cotton market has remained exceptionally quiet. The reasons for the mills' lack of interest are unknown, but purchasing of raw cotton for Tianjin has gradually increased, making the outlook for the cotton market optimistic.

### Food: Imported Rice on the Undisclosed Market Remains Firm Due to Optimism; Nearly 10,000 Bags of Rice Arrive Yesterday

The imported rice market continued to rise amid confusion yesterday. The widespread rumors excited sellers. Prices of lower-grade imported rice in each market again took the opportunity to reach their peak. In terms of quality, the market price rose by 0.5 to 1 yuan. The increased prices reduced buyers appetite. Additionally, the arrival of new goods from Japanese firms dampened the market, and the afternoon closed down a small 0.3-0.4 yuan. However, prices of higher-grade rice in each market remained stubbornly high. Prices for mixed and forward rice similarly pulled up by several corners to over a yuan. The December Saigon No. 2 rice with the Heyi mark opened at 94.1 yuan, and the January Hezhong mark opened at 88.5 yuan to 88 yuan. The December 9th small bag opened at 90...5 yuan to 92.8 yuan. The bulk packaging rice opened between 89 yuan and 90 yuan, The January Heyi mark opened at 83.5 yuan, and the February Jianyuan mark opened at 84 yuan, totaling between six and seven hundred tons. Six to seven thousand bags were traded spot. There are reports of multiple contacts with Japanese firms for new trades, with one contract for 1,000 tons of small bag rice from January for 80..5 yuan reportedly concluded. Mixed brand No. 1 Saigon opened at 87 yuan and 86.5 yuan, No. 2 was not opened, and Siamese also opened with only No. 1 at 86.3 yuan. Zhongguan fire milled opened at 86 yuan. second-grade opened at 84 yuan. Xin Feng was the only small bag to open on schedule with 1,300 to 1,400 bags at 79 yuan. Crushed tip opened at 75.5 yuan, Tokyo milled tip opened at 80.07 yuan, Red rough opened at 71.5 yuan and 71 yuan, Wuhu tip opened at 79.7 yuan.

Domestic rice such as thick and thin Japonica rice continues to arrive in limited quantities. Sales in this market have been strong due to the difficulty in purchasing imported rice. The price of domestic rice, propped up by sellers, continues to increase. Opening prices for Kunshan saw white Japonica rice at 99 yuan and 97 yuan, a special rice at 102 yuan, Qingjiao thin rice at 89.5 yuan to 89 yuan.

Although the supply of glutinous rice remains insufficient, the market has a plentiful supply and demand is normal, therefore it is difficult for prices to compete with other products. Prices remain flat. bleached ranged 95-96 yuan, fragrant and white rice ranged 84-81 yuan.

Imported rice continues to arrive in Shanghai. The Yihuo Shipping Company's Mingsheng ship transported imported rice from Hong Kong. The ship arrived yesterday at 4pm, docking at Roosevelt Wharf. The load totaled nine thousand four hundred and seventy-one bags. unloading will commence today.

### Vermicelli is held and not released

The price of vermicelli remains stable. Although a large amount of vermicelli has arrived since this firm promoted its sales, it is difficult to make new agreements, which is further complicated by reports that domestic factories are reducing production. As a result, prices have stopped falling. A large batch of Australian vermicelli is currently being unloaded. The total is estimated to be 350,000 bags. Most of the holders are tightly controlling prices and are unwilling to sell. A portion has been allocated to client assistance for re-export, therefore the price remains supported. Yesterday, the quoted prices for Fortress Brand and Beautiful Brand was 21.5 yuan, Clock Tower brand was 21.3 yuan. Sales through timber companies increased slightly by 4-5,000 bags. Because it is the end of the week, and foreign exchange has lengthened, new hoarding has lessened. Market dynamics have entered a state of fluctuation.

Small trades lack progression, because quantity has become more rare. a smaller portion of goods has been allocated to be sold with factories. The quoted price has been steady at thirty-two yuan. Domestic Factories have wanted to buy forward goods, but have found few new trades. market dynamics have entered a stable hold.

### Seafood: Pepper Rises Repeatedly

Because pepper supply is reduced and existing inventory is thinning, but outgoing volume is increasing, prices have repeatedly risen. Now the market price is 220 yuan for white pepper, Black big pepper is 112 yuan. Number 1 pepper is 115 yuan, an increase of over 10 yuan. Continued firm prices are expected.

### A Small Issue Regarding the Time for Clearing Checks - A Few Opinions on Returned Checks from the Bund - Ji Runmo

According to custom, if a depositor deposits an on-sight check into a bank, it is necessary to wait until the day of settlement before it can be determined whether it can be cleared, because after the bank receives the check deposited by the depositor, it must first hand it over to the clearing house for separate accounting, and then the clearing house will carry out procedures separately within its jurisdiction. If it belongs to the same bank, it will be added to the clearing at 3:15 p.m. on the same day; if it belongs to the outer Bund (i.e., foreign banks) or other banks (i.e., silver firms, money shops, and non-clearing banks), it will be delivered separately. After the returned checks from each bank are collected the next day, they will be returned to the original bank that received the check, and the ability to clear the deposited check will be determined based on whether or not the check is returned.

Currently, under normal circumstances, all checks deposited by depositors with the same bank before 3:00 p.m. can be added to the clearing on the same day. After the returned checks are exchanged after 11:00 a.m. the next day, if there is no return of a check, then it can be cleared. For checks belonging to other banks, the process is even faster than with the same bank. Usually, it can be determined whether it can be cleared after 10:00 a.m. the next day, but the time for receiving the check is much earlier than with the same bank. Usually, the books for the next day must be closed after 11:00 a.m. For checks belonging to the outer Bund, the time for receiving the check is the same as with the same bank, but the time for returning the check the next day is uncertain. Sometimes it comes around 12:00 p.m., sometimes around 10:00 a.m., and sometimes close to 2:00 p.m. As for whether there are any more returns after 2:00 p.m., it cannot be said for sure because there is no set time. In practice, banks always use 2:00 p.m. as the standard. If 2:00 p.m. arrives and there is no returned check, then the customer can freely clear the check, which can generally be said to be an appropriate arrangement. However, precisely because the return time of checks from the outer Bund banks is not fixed, there is some risk, which is quite inconvenient for both the bank itself and the customer. Therefore, I believe that in the future, the agency responsible for receiving and delivering returned checks from the outer Bund banks should find a standard time to reduce the trouble on all sides and, further, to avoid any possible malpractices. This is one point. (To be continued)

### Securities - Many Domestic Bonds Are Emerging

The gray market for public bonds saw slight changes yesterday. Trading was flat in the morning, but rumors suddenly arose in the afternoon, claiming that foreign exchange would not be supplied or would be reduced starting next week, ostensibly to resist something. The price of gold secretly surged by 150 to 160 yuan, and U.S. dollar notes rose to 18 yuan. People were restless, and rumors were rampant, mostly groping in the dark. Yesterday's sellers included Dingkang & Co., which was acting on behalf of a certain bank, indicating that there was a reason for the sales. In the morning, only Dingkang sold, while Yitai and Tongkang bought slightly. Market prices were slightly weak. In the afternoon, Dingkang continued to sell, and Shuntai and Yichang also sold heavily. Shengtda, Hengfu, and Lianyi, who had been bullish, all emerged. Tongkang covered their short positions, while Shunchang, Yitai, Shenchang, and Yizhong bought slightly. Market prices continued to decline, eventually falling by a uniform 1 to 5 jiao. Total transaction volume was 2.2 million yuan. A simplified table is provided below.

Stock trading: 500 shares of Hanyeping Company were traded at a price of 3 yuan per share.

### Nine - Oil Cakes - The Oil Market Is Stirring - Prices Surge by 3 Yuan

Yesterday, the oil market was flat in the morning with sluggish trading. In the afternoon, rumors of positive news from the financial market caused panic, and speculators took the opportunity to act. Whether it was raw soybean oil, everything was active, resulting in a sharp increase of 3 yuan. Yesterday, a total of 300 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil were traded; the price is detailed in the market price column. 50 pieces of Yantai raw oil and over 1,000 cans of canned oil were traded. Additionally, 100 barrels of Qingdao raw oil, 100 pieces of Jiaozhou soybean oil, 100 pieces of Yantai soybean oil, 20 barrels of Qingdao soybean oil, 450 pieces of Dasu soybean oil, and 600 dan of Dayou Factory soybean oil were traded.

### Piece Goods - Cotton Cloth Stimulates - Hoarders Are Widely Scouring

The factory cloth market was flat and weak in the morning but suddenly rose in the afternoon, resulting in prices higher than the previous day. This was because of widespread rumors that Chongqing's foreign exchange rate would be listed and that reductions would be implemented, stimulating sentiment. People widely scoured for goods in the market, and factories also took the opportunity to raise prices, resulting in a sudden increase in transactions. The selling was brisk. Fine cloth was sold at a minimum price of 36.50 yuan in the morning but was raised to 37.50 yuan in the afternoon, with little supply. All brands of fine cloth and twill cloth rose by 2.5 to 7.5 jiao per bolt. Coarse cloth rose by 2.5 to 5 jiao per bolt. Bleached and dyed cloth also increased by about 5 jiao per bolt. Over 2,000 pieces of various goods were traded on the street. Over 300 pieces of fine cloth and bleached and dyed cloth were handled by the Ningbo and Wenzhou merchants from Eastern Zhejiang. Over 200 pieces of twill cloth, bleached and dyed cloth, and foulard were handled by the Guangdong and Hong Kong merchants. Over 100 pieces of coarse cloth and blue cloth were handled by the Yantai merchants from the North. On the 22nd, 10 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Yantai and 1,895 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong.

The morning market for Dongbu cloth was stable. The closing price for Longtou fine cloth was 39 yuan and 1 jiao in the morning. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday, but the gray market trading among outside colleagues saw a sharp increase. Longtou fine cloth was traded at 40 yuan, and fine cloth was traded at 36 yuan, an increase of 5 to 7.5 jiao per bolt compared to the previous day.

### Demand for Western Suit Wool Is Sluggish

Yesterday was Saturday. The wool market was said to be not bad. Demand for light-colored, thin goods for spring and summer from inside and outside the industry was still strong. Both shops and factories continued to offer large quantities. Transactions for dark black, cold-weather goods were mostly sporadic, as the end of the lunar year was approaching, and both buyers and sellers adhered to the principle of selling and buying as needed. The market for Western suit wool has gradually become sluggish recently, as shops and stores are all trying to sell off their existing inventory to prepare for closing, so the trend is mediocre, unlike overcoat wool, which is more popular. Overcoat wool business is slow because customers mostly dislike the high prices and adopt a "get by" attitude. However, those who are truly cold and those whose clothes are worn out will temporarily make new ones, resulting in the actual sales period being longer than in previous years.

### Sugar Market - Sugar Prices Surge Wildly in the Afternoon

Yesterday, the sugar market was initially flat but then tightened. A certain rumor suddenly emerged in the afternoon, causing the upward trend to become even stronger. The Guild's listed prices for current goods were as follows: First-grade crude white sugar from foreign warehouses was initially 76 yuan but eventually rose to 77 to 77.5 yuan, an increase of 1.5 yuan. Dutch cotton BS mark was 74.8 yuan, an increase of 1 yuan. Dutch red sugar was initially soft in the morning at 60.6 to 61 yuan but rose to 62 to 62.5 yuan in the afternoon, an increase of 1.3 yuan. Taikoo car white B mark was 75.5 to 75.3 yuan in the morning but rose to 77 yuan in the afternoon, an increase of 1.2 yuan. DY mark was 72.3 yuan in the morning but rose to 74 yuan in the afternoon, an increase of 1.8 yuan. HX mark in West Warehouse was 72.2 yuan in the morning and 71.7 yuan for old stock. In the afternoon, West Warehouse goods were 74 yuan, an increase of 1.9 yuan.

### North-South Goods - Vermicelli Soars - Jinan Peach Kernels Also Rise by 20 Yuan

Vermicelli prices rose sharply because the commission charged by the local market was unfavorable, so 500 packages of goods were directly shipped to Hong Kong for sale, while only 300 packages were offered in Shanghai, resulting in a sudden increase of more than 20 yuan. Longkou vermicelli opened at 180 yuan, and Qingdao vermicelli opened at 160 yuan, both recent highs.

Peach Kernels - Arrivals of Jinan peach kernels have been scarce recently, so the market is still tight, and prices have risen again. Recently, new goods have been offered at a price of 200 yuan, an increase of 20 yuan. However, walnuts remain weak, such as Qingzhou walnuts, which are only 57 yuan.

### Medicinal Materials - Pangolin Scales Are Scarce - Prices Rise Again - 20 to 30 Yuan

Pangolin scales have been scarce recently. Market inventories are very low, so the trend is increasingly tight and gradually upward. Yesterday, pangolin scales reached 480 yuan, and pangolin skins also required 280 yuan. The increase in prices has been 20 to 30 yuan, and there is currently little hope of relief.

### Sino-American Charity Basketball Game - U.S. Retains Shen Bao Cup - U.S. Team Wins Again Last Night

The fourth annual Shen Bao Cup Sino-American Charity Basketball Tournament concluded last night with great success. The Shen Bao Cup will be retained by the U.S. team for another year. The Chinese team will have to wait until next year to compete for the championship. The U.S. team also won the third game last night with a score of 53 to 42. The Chinese team led in the first half with a score of 27 to 23. However, the U.S. team gradually surpassed them in the second half. The Chinese team initially fielded Wang Nanqun, Bao Songyuan, Liang Yunming, Ren Xiangcheng, and Chen Bangzhen. The three forwards, Liang, Wang, and Bao, were very successful in their attacks and took the lead. Unfortunately, luck was not on their side in the second half, and the U.S. team became increasingly aggressive, scoring eight consecutive points to make the score 27 to 31. The Chinese team brought on Zhen Zhongxiang, Long Xuechong, Nan Zhenhui, and Pei to try to save the game, but they were unable to reverse the defeat. The final score was 53 to 42. It is estimated that the ticket sales for this deciding game amounted to 3,000 to 4,000 yuan, which will be settled and announced within a few days. The proceeds will be divided equally into three parts and donated to the Shanghai Refugee Association, the Shanghai International Red Cross, and the West Qing Christmas Children's Party.

Children's Weekly

### Opening Day

— Editor

Confucius is our most sage and teacher, and also one of the greatest and most famous figures in our country's history. Whether men or women, old or young, literate or illiterate, when they speak of Confucius the Sage, almost everyone knows of him. Children who have gone to school, of course, know Confucius and respect him as well.

Confucius's personality, knowledge, thought, and morality all surpassed everything else; he was truly great. Children who have not read much may not fully understand and some may even regard him as a kind of illusory deity or Buddha. But in reality, he was indeed a man, just an extraordinary one.

Children are born thousands of years too late to see Confucius. Even if they read his books, apart from receiving his many teachings, they always feel a vague understanding of the events of his life. Now, things are better. You can now see this great Confucius appear before your very eyes, vividly portraying the events of his life, as if taking you back thousands of years. What is this? It is none other than the new grand film "Confucius" produced by the Min Hua Film Company.

Because we respect Confucius, we also attach special importance to this "Confucius" film and are publishing this special "Confucius" page for it. After school, children may as well go with their parents to the Jin Cheng Grand Theater to see it. In this film, you can see Confucius's way of being a person and understand why Confucius is so respected. This is truly the most beneficial kind of entertainment and can also be said to be the most meaningful kind of self-study outside of school lessons.

### Confucius

— Kang Yan

Have you already read the lesson on "Confucius" in your history textbooks? I think there is also a special day that you may remember more clearly, which is the public holiday of Confucius's birthday, because on that day, you can have a holiday and rest, and have a great time playing. When I was in elementary school, I remembered this day particularly clearly.

Why do we have a holiday to commemorate Confucius's birthday? Of course, it is because later generations admire his noble personality and the spirit of his unyielding and arduous struggle throughout his life.

Confucius, he was born in a time when treacherous officials and rebellious sons ran rampant. His great and immortal principles of "rectifying the heart, making the will sincere, cultivating the self, regulating the family, governing the state and pacifying the world, loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, and love" were difficult for those warmongering and mad fellows to accept. He traveled around the states for fourteen years, and finally had to return to his hometown, where, based on the history of Lu, he wrote a "Spring and Autumn Annals," recording the indolent state of affairs at that time one by one.

Although Confucius passed away two thousand years ago, his spirit, the events of his life, and all the historical sites related to him have been preserved to this day. The tomb of the Sage Confucius is now in Qufu, Shandong, fifteen feet high and fifty paces in circumference. Children, when you have the opportunity to go there in the future, you can go and take a look.

Children! Do you feel admiration for a person like Confucius? Then you should recognize his teachings and learn from them, embrace his spirit, and move forward. If you can learn even a little bit, even if you cannot become a great sage, you may be able to become a small sage!

### Confucius Traveling Around the States

— Zhen

Children: Are you all familiar with the name Confucius? You only know that he is a great sage of our country, considering him to be Master Kong or Mr. Kong, and do not know that he was a statesman. Unfortunately, in the Spring and Autumn period, the rulers were all foolish and incompetent and could not listen to Confucius's great principles. Therefore, when Confucius was fifty-six years old, he and his disciples Zilu, Zigong, Yan Hui, and more than ten others began their journey, running around the world. They worked hard outside for fourteen years, but in the end, they could not be employed by any state. The most dangerous place they encountered on the road was between Chen and Cai. At that time, Confucius was preparing to take his disciples to Chu, but Chen and Cai were afraid that Confucius's arrival in Chu would be detrimental to them, so they sent troops to block their way halfway, trapping Confucius and his party in the wilderness for a total of seven days and seven nights. The food that Confucius brought was all eaten, and they could not even get water to drink. If they did not break out, they would have to starve to death in the wilderness. At that time, Zilu was extremely angry and could not bear it anymore. He suddenly held an ax and shield, shouted loudly, and charged out. Zigong grabbed him and said, "There are so many soldiers from Chen and Cai surrounding us. How can you break out by yourself? It is better to wait for the rescue troops from Chu!" Zilu was still struggling to break a bloody path when he suddenly heard Confucius playing the qin inside the house. His courage gradually subsided with the sound of the qin, and he unconsciously put down the ax and shield in his hands. They finally managed to survive for seven days, and the rescue troops sent by Chu arrived, and Confucius and his disciples escaped danger.

### I Want to Learn From Zilu

— Liu Jiaquan

These past few days, the Jin Cheng Grand Theater has been showing the film "Confucius." Last night, my dad took me to see it.

This is truly a good film. In this film, I saw the war scenes with ancient chariots, bows and arrows, and swords; I saw the clothes, utensils, and living habits of ancient people; I saw and heard the voices and smiles of ancient sages; and I also saw the chaos of that time—the Spring and Autumn Period—the great powers invading the small powers, the ministers killing the rulers, and the sons killing the fathers. It gave me a lot of knowledge, more than what I got from attending several history classes, and it was even more interesting. Confucius is naturally great. In particular, his courage at the Jia Valley Meeting, which made the powerful Qi submit, is truly worthy of our admiration.

And among Confucius's many disciples, I admire Zilu the most. Because Zilu, in addition to learning a lot of knowledge from Confucius, was the only one who accepted Confucius's courage to not be afraid of the powerful and violent. He scolded the treacherous officials and rebellious sons, and fought against the Chen and Cai armies that surrounded them. At the same time, he also advised Confucius when Confucius unknowingly made mistakes. And in the end, Zilu finally completely obeyed Confucius's teachings, in order to defend the state of Wei, resist the Jin soldiers, and fight against the rebellious minister Yang Huo, and finally died in battle on the battlefield.

I love Zilu! I want to learn from Zilu!

Mr. Tang Huaiqiu playing Confucius in the "Confucius" film.

### To Young Readers

— Mincheng

Dear children: In three days, it will be Christmas, and when you commemorate this Western saint, please do not forget our Eastern sage—Confucius.

Although Confucius was a figure more than two thousand years ago, his teachings are still deeply rooted in the human world today, and his personality is still so worthy of respect by later generations.

Confucius's greatest advocacy was for people to "rectify the heart and make the will sincere, cultivate the self and regulate the family, govern the state and pacify the world," meaning to teach people to start by improving themselves and enriching themselves, and then gradually regulate the family, govern the state, and pacify the world. Although his life was mainly devoted to teaching, he was by no means a mere talker. He was able to set an example and teach his disciples, and he was able to tirelessly enlighten many rulers of the time. He held a firm resolve and traveled around the states, hoping to speak of the way of the sages to the people of the world. His spirit of sacrificing himself for the sake of the Dao is the main reason why he is forever respected.

In the past, we overly regarded Confucius as a deified idol, which is wrong. Now we should thoroughly understand him: he is a person just like us, and the events of his life are the best model for us to establish ourselves and conduct ourselves.

Now, things are better. The Min Hua Film Company has turned Confucius into a film. An ancient figure who was not easily understood by you children in books can now appear before your eyes like an ordinary person. I think you should take advantage of the Christmas and New Year holidays to ask your parents, elder brothers, and elder sisters to take you to the Jin Cheng Grand Theater to get to know this Eastern sage! I believe you will be able to gain the greatest benefit in two hours. I wish you happiness!

### Two Stories About Confucius

— Pan Shi

1. Teaching at the Apricot Altar

In the past, Confucius also taught many students, but his way of teaching was somewhat different from how we attend lecture halls now. He often saw something happening or something and would explain the principles in it to the students at any time, so that the students would know how to be an upright and useful good person. Sometimes he would also formally teach, teaching students to read poetry and write essays, learn etiquette, and learn music. In addition, they also had to learn archery and chariot driving. Like our physical education class, they trained their bodies well, so that they had both literary and martial skills, so that they could contribute to the country and do things for everyone in the future. He also taught students to be polite, to have a good conscience, to be righteous, not to do bad things, not to be greedy, and to know shame. The place where they had classes was called "Apricot Altar," perhaps because there were many apricot trees around.

2. Speaking of Aspirations on Mount Nong

Once, Confucius and several of his good students went to travel in the mountains. When they reached the high mountains, Confucius asked the students what their aspirations were for the future. Zilu was very brave, so he replied: "I am willing to go to the battlefield to fight against the enemy." Zigong was very eloquent, so he said: "If two countries start a war, he is willing to impartially judge who is right and who is wrong?" Yan Hui was benevolent, he said: "I am willing to make everyone in the world have clothes to wear, have food to eat, understand the principles, and live happily, loving each other like brothers and sisters." Confucius saw that the students were very ambitious, so he happily praised them and encouraged them.

### The Sunlight of Dawn (II)

— Light

Last time in this newspaper, we said that Jesus is the "Sunlight of Dawn." Why do we say that?

(1) He is the beginning of the Gospel: Jesus's Gospel, unlike Judaism, does not have regional and ethnic restrictions, but meets the needs of all mankind. Regardless of whether people are civilized or uncivilized, and regardless of whether the land is cold or hot, everyone can benefit from hearing the Gospel, live a noble life by knowing God, and extend love to others by knowing God's love. Sunlight shines on the earth, and Jesus's Gospel is similarly available to all.

(2) He is the beginning of the union of human and divine life: The boundary between God and man has always been as wide as a chasm. Since Jesus was born, the world has had a new life of "human-divine union." Saint Paul said: "God made us friends with himself through Jesus..." He also said: "We beg you on behalf of Jesus to reconcile with God" (2 Corinthians 5:18/20) Jesus himself also said: "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one can come to the Father except through me (John 14:6)

(3) He is a ray of dawn in the shadow of death: Christmas is an opportunity for relatives and friends to gather together. Have any new friends left us this year? Last year, he shared joy with you during Christmas, and won't you feel sad without him this year! But why bother? This sunlight of dawn has already shone! This light not only illuminates us who live in the world, but also shines into the valley of the shadow of death. Didn't Jesus also enter that dark tomb, resurrect on the third day, break the darkness, and give us all the hope of resurrection? If you cannot be comforted by this ray of dawn, then there is nothing else in the world that can comfort you! How can your sadness and your tears be stopped? Today, you must believe without doubt that the "Sunlight of Dawn" has already shone. May you accept this light and no longer grope in the darkness, indulging in meaningless sorrow, "for this light is the true light, which gives light to everyone who comes into the world" (John 1:9). Since it says "everyone who comes into the world," of course, you are included, and Heavenly Father has not abandoned you. (To be continued on the twenty-fifth)

### New Trends in the Theater World at the End of the Year

— Sick Dove

Every year at the end of the year, Peking opera theaters must adjust roles and recruit new talent to prepare for the competition in the New Year. This year, the lineups of each theater are very neat, and the roles are also rarely adjusted. However, in order to strengthen their lineups, each troupe is now hiring new actors separately. A summary of what I have heard is presented to the public.

Golden Hall: Lian Chengye Shengzhang Shenghou recruited Wu Sheng Shang Heyu, Xiao Sheng Cheng Jixian, and Xu Sheng Shi Huibao, etc. The talent for Dan roles has not yet been decided. Shang Cheng and Shi are all veteran performers and are also the last surviving typical figures in today's theater world. Shang's "Tie Long Mountain," "Siping Mountain," "Shenting Ridge," "Yan Yang Tower," and other plays have exquisite skills and are refined and calm. Although he is old, his heroic posture is still impressive and his majesty remains the same. Every move is worth learning from. Although Ji Xian's voice has deteriorated, his steady movements and clear enunciation still exist as a model and can be used as a reference for future generations. Zhi Nong came to the south last year. His grand and majestic singing style and elegant and unrestrained are being negotiated. Ying Guang She of Song Dezhu and the opera school class led by Song Yuru have not yet been decided.

Renewal: Renewal took over from Li Wanchun. The team included Yan Huizhu, Sun Yukun, Jiang Miaoxiang, Liu Lianrong, etc. Before the new actors arrived in Shanghai, Shen Manhua, Zhang Yunlou, and the troupe's Wang Hongfu, etc., temporarily performed for a short period as a transition. Yan Huizhu came to the south with her father last year and made guest appearances in plays such as "Entering the Palace Twice," and also owned the "San Niang Teaches Her Son" Peking opera film. Her beautiful appearance and moving demeanor have been hard-working in recent years, and her art should have improved greatly. Sun Yukun has not been to Shanghai for a long time, and is worthy of attention. Sun Ling's body is strong and his martial arts are superb. Plays such as "Picking Hua Che" and "Changban Slope" directly enter the Yang family's room. When Xiaolou was alive, he loved this child the most. His artistic sophistication can be imagined. Miaoxiang Lianrong has come to the south frequently over the years and is known to the people of Shanghai, so I will not go into details.

Carlton: The roles of Yifeng Society have always been known for their balance. After the reorganization this autumn, the lineup is slightly weakened, especially the Xiao Sheng, Xiao Chou, and Wu Lian. It is heard that Ge Cijiang has been invited to rejoin. Xiao Sheng and Hua Lian are still in the making. During the Lunar New Year, the old ones will still be performed for ten days, and "The Six Articles of Wen Suchen" will be staged during the year.

Great Stage: Since the Great Stage performed "The Legend of the Supernatural Sword Master," the business has been booming. The main roles such as Lin Shusen, Xue Youqin, and Zhang Shuxian are still in continuous service. New roles were hired: Wu Sheng Zhang Delu and Shen Xiaoting will join on the Lunar New Year's Day. Zhang Ling is a southern Wu Sheng predecessor with a very wide stomach. Shen Ling has performed in Jinan and other places. And he has a reputation.

Common Stage: Zhao Ruquan will continue to lead the performance on the Public Stage at the beginning of the year. Recently, Chen Yuelou went north to invite roles and invited Liu Hanchen, Yang Weina, and Zhang Ruting. Hanchen was a popular actor in Shanghai and was known for his explosive performances. The play "Golden Money Leopard" once enjoyed a great reputation. Recently, due to his age, he switched to acting in laborious Wu Sheng plays. Kun Dan Yang Weina, formerly a social flower in Peiping, has only recently entered the sea and is known in the north. Her appearance is as gorgeous as Wu Suqiu, and her acting skills are also exquisite and remarkable and should be sensational for a while. Zhang Ruting has been away from the people of Shanghai for a long time. When he was on the Samsung Stage in a certain year, he was in the same class as Zhao Ruquan and was not very successful. In recent years, his art is unknown whether it has improved. The theater plans to stage "The Case of Peng Gong" next year, and the role of Peng Gong may belong to Ruting.

Tianchan: After Zhao Songqiao joined, the Tianchan Stage has greatly strengthened its lineup. The main play "Huang Tianba" will continue to be staged next year. The theater's style is characterized by fiery and lively performances, so there are many talents in martial arts. Recently, due to the departure of Xiao Zhao Songqiao, the authorities have hired Wang Qichang and Xia Junting to join in filling the gap. Wang Ling's acting skills are exquisite, and he is especially brave. On the stage, he played "Golden Money Leopard" and was called Yu Liang by Wang Yingwu.

5. Beautiful Shadows on Mandarin Duck Lake

Mu Zhai once wrote a hundred-rhyme poem of "Beautiful Girl from the South" for her, which can be said to have exhausted Chang Ji's efforts, and won the beauty's favor. If she was willing to marry Mu Zhai, it was partly because she admired Mu Zhai's talent and reputation, and partly to contend with Chen Wuzi, as she would only marry a man of renown. Mu Zhai's talent and fame were only above Chen's, not below, which would show Chen Wuzi. So she once said to her sister Jiang Zi: "The high-nosed lord, even if he is not unique in ancient and modern times, is also a subversive hero of an era. How can the rest of you mediocre people hope to reach his heights?" So she did not dislike Mu Zhai's old age. Aunt Xu originally welcomed Chancellor Qian and strongly encouraged them to be together. Mu Zhai did not spare his wealth, measuring pearls to propose, and only then was he able to fulfill his wish. On this day, they performed the wedding ceremony on a boat in Mandarin Duck Lake. Many famous officials, talented men, and beautiful women, who were free, all came to congratulate. The weather was clear, and the painted boats on Mandarin Duck Lake were like clouds. The flutes and drums were noisy, the guests were numerous, and the Qi Laohe was in harmony. The etiquette was complete, and it can be said to be very grand. The rhyme was spread between Mandarin Duck Lake and Yushan. At this time, Mu Zhai was already sixty years old, with all his beard and hair white, while Liu Rushi was in full bloom, with condensed fat and graceful body. At that time, there was a rhyme of "a pear blossom tree pressing begonias." Qian Mu Zhai married Rushi, and returned to Yushan together. The neighbors even had frivolous children, who threw stones in front of their painted boat as they passed. Mu Zhai ignored it and returned to the mountain villa, where he wrote four chapters of a reunion poem as a memorial for the future. He then called Liu Rushi the Lady of Hedong, and the family all called her Madam Liu, treating Liu Rushi with great respect, unlike ordinary small stars. Mu Zhai also built a five-room pearl building at the foot of Beishan, named "Jiang Yun," taking the meaning of the descent of the celestial maiden from the true Gao Jiang, comparing Liu Rushi to a celestial being in the sky, with thousands of volumes of books. The two met morning and evening, proofreading many rare books and ancient editions. Often, when Qian Mu Zhai wanted to search for a certain volume for textual research, Liu Rushi could randomly draw a certain book and volume from tens of thousands of books, without fail, showing Liu Rushi's strong memory. Famous scholars from all over the world came one after another, and there were many guests in Jiang Yun Tower. Sometimes Mu Zhai was too lazy to come out to see them, so Liu Rushi came out to entertain them on his behalf, sometimes wearing a mink crown and leather boots, sometimes wearing feathered clothes, and she was elegant and unrestrained, which was rare even among men, let alone women? Moreover, she had read tens of thousands of volumes, and had a thorough knowledge of ancient and modern times, so when she answered guests, she was eloquent and had endless responses, and the guests were all captivated by her. Historical stories have been passed down a lot. When the people of Yushan mentioned the three words Lady of Hedong, everyone praised her, and everyone knew that she was an extraordinary woman.

### After Reading "Business Economics"

— Shi Min

Xu Xisheng, a stage designer, had planned to write a script for several months on the theme of nouveau riche in the special environment of the isolated island. The original title of the play was "Conscience Trade", but he felt that such a scope was too broad, and in the minds of upright gentlemen like us, it was a bit difficult to measure the activities of these bad-conscience people, so although he once started writing, it is said that it soon stopped invisibly.

Perhaps it was because he suffered too much from the oppression of these bad-conscience people, and with the urging of his friends, he resolutely picked up his pen again and decided to target the rice weevils who were suffering from the pain of new experiences, accompanied by the blind love-supremacy ideas of isolated island men and women. So, a month ago, a work criticizing the times was completed.

In "Business Economics", we not only know the selfishness, conspiracy, and viciousness of these bad-conscience people, but we also see the omen of the demise of these people. Although we do not believe in cause and effect, we hope that the traces of these bastards may be what the people of the isolated island are looking forward to! Therefore, although there is no bright and positive indication here, the reverse side of the shadow may be more able to reveal the right path!
