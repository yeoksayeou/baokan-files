### Chongqing Allocates Funds for New Air Raid Shelters

To better protect residents during air raids, the Chongqing government has allocated 500,000 yuan for the construction of new air raid shelters. Currently, Chongqing has 1,189 air raid shelters, accommodating 368,195 people. According to the latest population survey, the city's population, excluding the suburbs, is 353,188. This year, Japan may use five times the number of aircraft for bombing compared to last year. However, the number of casualties this year is only two-thirds of last year's figure. The Chongqing Air Defense Auxiliary Team currently has over 10,000 people, mostly civilian volunteers. (Reuters, 22nd)

### Japan Intensifies Preparations for Southern Advance; Long Yun Discusses Sino-Japanese War Situation; Japan Recognizes Military Conquest of China as Impossible; Threat to Burma Road Will Not Impede Transportation

Kunming - Yunnan Provincial Chairman General Long Yun, in an exclusive interview with the Associated Press today, stated that Japan is preparing to seize resource-rich but poorly defended countries such as Vietnam, Thailand, and Burma. Chairman Long predicts that China will continue to fight, and the war will end through diplomatic rather than military means. Chairman Long highly praised the United States' economic measures against Japan but felt that the economic measures adopted by the United States were not aggressive enough. However, neither the United States nor Japan desires war. General Long, who has governed Yunnan for twelve years, received the reporter at his headquarters, located on the site of a 17th-century Ming Dynasty empress's residence. The reporter was surprised by Long's simple attire and gentle demeanor upon entering Long's personal reception room. Long's appearance and demeanor were those of a typical scholar, not a rough military man. His words and actions were characterized by the gentleness of an artist, the precision of a scientist, the alertness of a military strategist, and the wisdom of a philosopher. Although Long is middle-aged, he is physically fit and appears to be in his thirties. He showed great interest in discussing the international situation and continued to tell the reporter, "After three years of fighting in China, Japan has realized the obvious fact that it is impossible to conquer China by force. Japan is now regretting the endless and unprofitable war in China and is attempting a southern advance with diplomatic and strategic schemes to gain benefits without spending money or manpower. Tokyo's current scheme to disturb the eastern corner of Asia is to incite war between Thailand and Vietnam to profit from it." In the center of the black paneled wall of Long's reception room hangs a photo of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and Long taken in 1935 when Chairman Chiang visited Yunnan. Long, a cigar smoker, after lighting a cigar with a match, told the reporter, "The Japanese are now planning Burma to seize Burma's oil fields and rice paddies on the one hand and cut off our country's international transportation on the other, achieving two goals with one arrow. As for the threat posed by the Japanese bombing of bridges on the Burma Road, the actual experience last month has proven that this threat is impossible. Even if most of the cables of the bridges on the Burma Road are cut off, leaving only one, we can still transport goods back and forth on it. Our transportation will not be hindered by this. The Japanese may now even be planning to overthrow Thailand and use the pretext of passing through that country. I believe that the Japanese will not dare to attack the Dutch East Indies or Singapore rashly before occupying Vietnam, Thailand, and Burma." When the reporter inquired about the rumored Japanese intentions toward Saigon, Chairman Long replied that the Japanese troops concentrated on Hainan Island could land in Saigon at any time and predicted that the French would not resist once the Japanese troops landed in Saigon. Regarding US-Japan relations, Chairman Long said that the various actions taken by the United States in recent years are admirable, "But I believe that a US-Japan war will not happen in the near future. Japan is very cautious towards the United States and is trying its best to avoid actual war with the United States. And the United States is unwilling to engage in military action without serious consideration beforehand. The economic means of the United States may be sufficient to cause difficulties for Japan, but Washington has not fully implemented what it should in its economic sanctions." Chairman Long also said that Yunnan Province has a very rich harvest this year, and food is guaranteed to be sufficient. Chairman Long often goes to investigate the bombed areas after each air raid in Yunnan and personally supervises the preparations. Fire prevention preparations to deal with incendiary bombs have now been completed. Chairman Long predicts that the Chinese people will continue to fight, and the Sino-Japanese war "can only end when the Japanese realize that China cannot be conquered by force. I believe that this war will not end with military force but with diplomatic means." (Associated Press, 22nd)

Japanese Troops Being Transferred to South China

Chongqing - Yesterday, when entertaining the press here, the Chinese military spokesman said that Japan's preparations for the southern advance can be seen from the large number of Japanese troops being transferred from Vietnam to the Zhongshan area near Macau. The First Imperial Guard Division, formerly stationed in Shandong, has also been transferred to South China. It is expected that these troops will soon join the two divisions currently concentrated on Hainan Island. In the past week, due to the relocation of Japanese vehicles, there have only been minor contacts on various front lines. (Haitong News Agency, 22nd)

Chongqing - When the military spokesman here entertained news reporters this afternoon, he mentioned the movements of Japanese troops in China, saying that according to unverified news, some of the Japanese troops stationed in Shandong and the Northeast have recently been withdrawn. Recently, a new Japanese division has arrived in Central China, and there are also signs of a large number of Japanese troops arriving in the Zhongshan area near Guangzhou, a large part of which was recently withdrawn from Vietnam. The spokesman estimated that there are currently a total of one division of Japanese troops stationed in Vietnam. A reporter asked whether the Japanese army would try to cross the Yellow River this winter. The spokesman replied that the Japanese army is now concentrating its efforts on expanding southwest, so it may not try to attack the northwest. Although there are several places on the Yellow River where the ice freezes three feet thick in winter, the Japanese army and its equipment can advance on the ice, but the Japanese army may not make this attempt, partly because the important crossing points near Luoyang are still in the hands of the Chinese army, and partly because the Chinese army has made sufficient preparations to deal with this attempt.

Japan to Launch Guangdong-Jiangxi Offensive

Hong Kong - If the Japanese army launches another attack on Shaoguan, the wartime capital of Guangdong Province, the senior Guangdong military officers now in Nanning are ready to fight in Guangdong Province. Upon hearing the news that 10,000 Japanese soldiers are heading to Guangdong, their desire to return to Guangdong arose spontaneously. According to an unconfirmed report, among the Japanese detachments coming to Guangdong, there are elite guard troops who participated in the Battle of Kunlun Pass northeast of Nanning last winter and have rich experience. They come directly from Japan and represent the elite of the Japanese army. The Chinese military authorities believe that if the Japanese decide to advance northward again, they will attack Wengyuan from Zengcheng north of the East River, or attack north from Xinshi on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, or from Lulong (transliteration) in the Shantou area to the East River (where there is a highway to Shaoguan). However, the Japanese may not take the last mentioned route, as the Japanese army in Shantou is currently taking a defensive posture. Chinese military reports say that 10,000 Japanese troops have arrived in Guangzhou, some of whom will be stationed in Baoan, and 6,000 can be used in the Guangzhou and West River areas. Although the Japanese guards are not really ill, they need a major rest due to the unsuitable weather in the Nanning area. It is said that the Chinese headquarters in Shaoguan has received orders from the central military authorities in China not to take a defensive posture but to adopt a "strategic offensive" in Guangxi to try to make the Japanese army withdraw from Nanning. The plan for this strategic offensive, planned by the Guangdong generals in Guangxi, has been transmitted from Guilin to here today. The new commander-in-chief of the Japanese army in Guangzhou is also expected to launch a new offensive in Guangdong to increase his military reputation, but the Japanese army in Vietnam is not under his command.

French Deny Thai-Vietnamese Conflict

Vichy - Regarding the situation in French Indochina, there are many rumors from foreign sources that a separatist movement has occurred in the colony of Cochinchina, causing considerable anxiety to the French authorities. It is said that the Governor-General of Vietnam, Lieutenant General Decoux, has resigned, and even that Vietnamese and Thai troops have clashed on the Mekong River border. The official here has repeatedly denied this, dismissing it as completely unfounded, and stating that the US State Department denied on the 18th of this month the rumor that Britain and the United States supported Thailand's territorial claims against Vietnam. (Havas News Agency, 21st)

Vichy - French officials here said that rumors of war between Vietnamese and Thai troops are completely unfounded. (Haitong News Agency, 22nd)

Tokyo - When the Foreign Ministry spokesman entertained news reporters today, he was asked about the border conflict between Thai and Vietnamese troops. The spokesman replied that the government had not received official information to verify the news reports. When a reporter asked for his opinion on the Hong Kong newspaper report about China blocking the Yunnan-Vietnam border, the spokesman answered irrelevantly, saying, "This is good," and added that the news from Hong Kong had not received official verification but that if it was true, it would be very comforting, as the Japanese army entered Vietnam to cut off the supply line between Chongqing and Vietnam. (Reuters, 22nd)

Japan Claims Increased Friendship with Vietnam

Hanoi - The Japanese side here declared today that the friendly relations between Vietnam and Japan are increasing, while anti-Japanese activities on the American side here are increasing daily. The Japanese side also said that it is rumored that an American enterprise company has refused to provide its warehouses outside Hanoi to the Japanese army for storing fuel. Japanese military officials and the Vietnamese authorities are very angry about this. The side also said that the American enterprise company's refusal was instigated by the American consul. It is said that the fuel was transported to Hanoi under the French-Japanese agreement. According to the Japanese, the Vietnamese authorities are now continuing to transport oil to Hanoi regardless of the company's existence, because the company, which is a [sic - word missing] enterprise, is obviously American property. When the Japanese army entered Vietnam, they suddenly changed to American nationality. (Associated Press, 22nd)

### 986 Japanese Aircraft Destroyed in China; Chinese Air Force Strength Improved; Hope to Obtain Fighter Planes from US

Chongqing - According to an official announcement today, a total of 986 Japanese aircraft have been destroyed in the past forty months of the Sino-Japanese War, of which 308 were shot down by Chinese aircraft, 236 were destroyed on the ground, and 164 were shot down by anti-aircraft guns. The Japanese aircraft damaged and crashed behind the Chinese military front were not included. According to official estimates, since the beginning of the war, the foreign property lost due to Japanese air raids is the largest for Britain, totaling 1,949,465 yuan, followed by the United States, with 1,468,809 yuan, then Italy with 744,870 yuan, Germany with 150,000 yuan, Spain with 30,000 yuan, France with 17,500 yuan, and Sweden with 3,000 yuan. According to a spokesman for the Chinese Air Force, the above figures do not include property losses of foreign governments and institutions, but only private losses of foreign nationals in China. (Reuters, 22nd)

Chongqing - A military spokesman pointed out that the main shortcoming of the current Chinese military offensive is the lack of aircraft, saying that if China can obtain 500 aircraft from the United States, the Chinese military can immediately begin a general offensive. According to military experts, Japan's air force strength totals 3,000 aircraft, of which 1,100 are used in China and 400 are stationed in Manchuria. However, since a large number of aircraft were recently withdrawn from China for possible southern advances and national defense, approximately 600 aircraft are currently fighting in China. China now has bomber squadrons, but due to the lack of fighter protection, they cannot be used. If 500 fighter planes can be obtained from the United States, the skies can be controlled, and the Chinese military can take the initiative in land warfare. (Reuters, 22nd)

### New Fourth Army's Troop Transfer Not Yet Implemented

Chongqing - Regarding the news that the Chinese New Fourth Army will be transferred from the Central China region to a certain province in North China, according to a responsible person from the Kuomintang, the detailed report on the troop transfer has not yet been received here, and it will generally take some time before it can be implemented.

Editorial

### Telephone Rate Increase

Recently, it has been rumored that the Shanghai Telephone Company will increase its rates. The rumor has been circulating for a long time and once stimulated the price of telephone stocks, causing them to rise, but they later returned to dormancy, mainly because it was under consideration by the Municipal Council. A week ago, it was reported that the Municipal Council had formulated temporary measures for the telephone rate increase. There are three principles: in addition to new telephone installation deposits and increased fees for moving machines, installing branch machines, etc., the increase in users' regular contributions is substantial; one is to reduce the basic number of calls: business telephones are reduced from 150 calls to 100 calls, and residential telephones are reduced from 100 calls to 85 calls; in terms of percentages, the rights of users to make calls are reduced by 30%; in addition, the monthly rental fee is increased by 30%; plus the call fee beyond the basic number of calls; each time from 3 cents increased to 7 cents, the increase is 133%. Assuming a business telephone makes 300 calls per month, according to the old rules, in addition to the monthly rental of 10 yuan, the excess of 150 calls is charged at 3 cents per call, totaling 4 yuan and 5 cents. The total is 14 yuan and 5 cents. According to the new rules, the monthly rental is 10 yuan, with 100 calls, plus an additional fee of 30%, totaling 13 yuan, and the excess of 200 calls is charged at 7 cents per call, totaling 14 yuan, the total is 27 yuan. The average number of calls for business telephones exceeds the average, although no statistics are available, it is safe to say that it is more than 200 times; even according to 200 calls, the monthly increase in expenses for users has reached 86%. However, if the number of calls exceeds more, the increase rate is greater. In short, it is no exaggeration to say that today's telephone rate increase is more than 100% compared to the original. Those who oppose it say that the development of telephones in Shanghai is purely due to the increase in users in the concessions, and it is unwise to increase their burden now. Some also say that the large increase in the number, once implemented, will not only have a negative impact on industry and commerce, but most residents will be unable to bear the burden. Therefore, it is believed that although the municipal authorities of the two concessions have recently approved it, users generally hope that the authorities will seriously review the income and expenditure of the telephone company again; if the price increase is inevitable, the percentage of the price increase should also be reduced. This is the opinion of users reported in the newspapers, which is also the reaction caused by the temporary measures for the price increase.

I believe that public utilities are originally intended to facilitate public use, aiming to allow the public to obtain the greatest enjoyment at the lowest cost. Therefore, the municipal authorities treat public utilities with special preferential treatment, allowing them to operate monopolistically, so as to protect their due interests, and also to make them serve the public faithfully. Because of this, it is better for such undertakings to be run by the city. However, because the spirit of official management is often not as good as that of commercial management, there are many cases of public utilities returning to commercial management from municipal management. Having returned to commercial management, businessmen naturally treat them the same as general profit-making enterprises, calculating every ounce of profit from their capital; once the profits cannot meet their expectations, they will inevitably raise prices regardless of the burden, in order to compensate for what they want; thus, they are nominally public utilities but in reality no different from private enterprises, which is also an inevitable harm of commercial management, and the citizens suffer the consequences.

Electricity, heat, and power have increased in price; public buses and trams have increased in price; tap water and gas have also increased in price; even if the telephone company has no need to increase prices, can it not be moved and think of emulating it? Moreover, at a time when prices are high, there is no shortage of excuses to raise prices, so the telephone company's decision to increase prices cannot be solely blamed. Even if the municipal authorities have allowed various public utilities to increase prices first, it is not fair to deny the telephone company from following suit. Thus, since the price increase is a universal fact; the only thing in contention is the degree of the price increase. The telephone rate increase has been under consideration for several months, and the permission to increase it in this way must have its reasons for increasing it, and it is certainly not comparable to a rashly granted request. However, what should be noted is that public utilities should not increase the burden on the public because of the general increase in prices, thinking that the prices obtained by public utilities are too low; nor should they be greedy for the windfall profits of private businesses and be unwilling for public utilities to have a sigh of regret. All of this, I know, the municipal authorities will never have this idea: but can those who operate public utilities guarantee that they will not have this idea? The company relies on its documents for consideration, so the reasons for the application must be justified, and the proof provided must be thorough and without omissions. Moreover, under the management of foreign merchants, the concept of currency value is very important. In the case of undertakings invested and operated in China, they are still calculated in foreign exchange everywhere, so when foreign exchange is short, the price will increase accordingly. However, it is known that when foreign exchange increased greatly during the First European War, no public utility was heard of reducing prices at that time.

Today, the Municipal Council reviews the rate increase event of public utilities, which is closely related to the welfare of citizens. It must first consider the interests of citizens, and then consider the interests of the undertakings. However, public utilities want to increase the burden on the public, they should also let the public know the burden that should be increased, and the reason why the burden comes from the servants, but today, those who increase the burden on the public only know the consequences of this burden, but do not know the factual reasons for this burden. How can this make the public happy to bear the burden without complaint!

Some say that the facts of the price increase may involve secrets in its operation, so there is no reason to make it public, so are the reasons for the price increase all that cannot be told to people? This is how we know it is not, because the position of public utilities is different from that of general industries and businesses, so its actions should give the public the opportunity to see and hear them.

### Change of Command Flagship for US Asiatic Fleet; Another Batch of US Aircraft Transported to Philippine Islands to Increase Defense

Manila - The USS Houston today became the flagship of the US Asiatic Fleet, which is the second time in history. Rear Admiral Glassford, Commander-in-Chief of the US Asiatic Fleet, transferred from the USS Augusta to the USS Houston at 9:00 a.m. after a ceremony. The USS Augusta will soon sail back to the United States. Today's ceremony completed the [ship's] seven years of service in the Asiatic Fleet. It is said that the ship replaced the USS Houston as the flagship on November 14, 1933. (Associated Press, 22nd)

### US Far East Policy Strengthens; Matsuoka Diplomacy Fails; Nomura Delays Trip to Tokyo, US-Japan Talks Stalled; US Reporter Observes Japan Unable to Wage War in Pacific

Tokyo - When the Foreign Ministry entertained news reporters today, it was asked whether the government had received news from Washington indicating that the United States had changed its attitude towards the Far East, in particular towards Japan. The spokesman replied, "No." A US reporter said that US Ambassador Grew had held multiple talks with Japanese authorities some days ago, including two talks with Foreign Minister Matsuoka and one with the Vice-Minister. There has been no contact between the two sides since then. He asked what the nature of the multiple talks was and why there had been no contact in recent days. The spokesman declined to disclose the nature of the talks and said that the fact that the diplomatic representative had not visited the Foreign Minister of the host country was enough to indicate that there were no important questions pending discussion between the two countries. He was also asked why the formal announcement of Nomura's appointment as ambassador to the United States had been delayed. The spokesman replied that this was because the necessary formalities for the formal announcement had not yet been completed. (Reuters, 22nd)

Honolulu - Frederick Moore, the former owner of the Japan Advertiser, who passed through here on a Japanese ship yesterday en route to the United States, said that Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka would never start a war with the United States. Matsuoka had told him that the purpose of Japan's treaty with the Axis powers was to restrain the United States and prevent it from taking [militarily] aggressive action in the Pacific. Moore also said that he believed there would be no US-Japan war in the Pacific, but that this plan was unwelcome in the eyes of the big navy faction who advocated expanding the navy. If the United States gets involved in the European war, Japan will follow the Three-Power Pact and take action. People of normal psychology in both the United States and Japan do not want war. If the United States joins the war, it will be the end of world civilization. If the United States remains neutral, it can save world civilization. Japan's southern advance policy is only economic in nature and not military in nature. Japan only wants to gain economic control in the Dutch East Indies and does not want to use force. Japan has not yet planned to seize the Dutch East Indies with its navy. However, so far, Japan's economic wishes in the Dutch East Indies, such as gasoline, have not been markedly successful. Moore also said that although Nomura had not been formally appointed as ambassador to the United States, he himself was reluctant to accept the position. Moore also said that Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke is now continuing to urge Nomura to accept the position. (Associated Press, 22nd)

Tokyo - The Kokumin Shimbun today wrote an editorial urging Prime Minister Konoe to beware of pro-American and status quo factions within the country. The Kokumin Shimbun said that elements in Japan's political and economic circles are now in possession of powerful potential, advocating that the Japanese government maintain the status quo. The newspaper also said that Japan's international path, after the establishment of the Three-Power Alliance, has made friction with Britain and the United States unavoidable. The newspaper also said that the Konoe Cabinet should take on the arduous responsibility of leading Japan through the international crisis and establishing a "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." The newspaper pointed out that factions advocating maintaining the status quo are now regaining power in the political and economic spheres. The newspaper added, "Regarding this matter, the most unforgivable are the pro-American elements among them." (Associated Press, 22nd)

### Nazi Espionage in America: US Investigative Committee Releases Report, Important Documents Seized Exposing Secrets

WASHINGTON - The Congressional "Committee to Investigate Anti-American Activities," also known as the "Dies Committee," yesterday ordered the search of documents belonging to pro-Japanese, pro-Nazi, pro-Fascist, and pro-Communist groups in eight major cities. These eight cities are Baltimore, Buffalo, Boston, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, New Orleans, Milwaukee, and Denver. Simultaneously, the committee released a report, compiled based on documents seized from German commercial firms and the Transocean News Service in New York. One section specifically exposes the relationship between Japanese diplomats in the United States and the Transocean News Service. The original text states that the Transocean News Service not only offered advice to Japanese diplomats but also informed the German government on how to deal with American affairs. The committee claims to have documents proving that "The Transocean News Service is the main propaganda organ of the Nazi Party in Guatemala, Mexico, Cuba, Ecuador, Argentina, and Brazil. Materials sent from Germany to various countries in the Americas are vehemently anti-American, and the Transocean News Service distributes them to local newspapers without charge." The committee also obtained evidence that Chipura (president of the Transocean News Service in the United States) paid close attention to the United States' handling of diplomatic relations with Japan, sometimes offering suggestions not only to the Japanese ambassador but also reporting to his own government on what steps should be taken to be advantageous. One telegram to Berlin stated, "The strongest and only way to ensure America's neutrality is to cause complications in US-Japan diplomatic relations. This way, America will not be able to get involved in European affairs for a certain period of time in the present and future." Currently, the US State Department seems to be trying to clear up the Far East situation so that it can have more strength to focus on Europe. In recent weeks, both official and unofficial anti-German propaganda in the United States has increased. If this continues to increase, the impact on public psychology will be significant, creating a preliminary stage for the United States to abandon its formal neutrality." (22nd United Press dispatch)

NEW YORK - The American "Wireless Telegraph Communications Agency" declares that the white paper released by the Congressional Dies Committee after investigating anti-American activities mentions that a certain employee of the New York branch of the Transocean News Service is an employee of the "Wireless Telegraph Communications Agency," which is not true. Quisenberry (surname) Assel (given name) of the Transocean News Service is not related to Quisenberry (surname, different character) (given name) of the "Wireless Telegraph Communications Agency."

### Evacuated British Women Unlikely to Return to Hong Kong

HONG KONG - According to a public statement released here today, the Colonial Office believes that the situation in the Far East is unlikely to improve in the short term, making it impossible for the dependents of British expatriates who have already been evacuated to return to Hong Kong. The Hong Kong government recently received successive petitions from British women who had been evacuated and their husbands remaining in Hong Kong, requesting permission for those who had left Hong Kong to return. Therefore, it specifically sought instructions from the home government, and the reply was received by telegram and issued as a public statement. (22nd Reuters dispatch)

### American Missionary Arrested in Japan

HONOLULU - It was learned here yesterday that Ms. Lawrence, an American church missionary who had served in Seoul, Korea, for twenty years, was arrested by Japanese police in Yokohama yesterday while on a ship returning to the United States.

According to passengers on the ship, US Ambassador to Japan Grew was at the pier saying goodbye to friends when he heard the news and promised to do his best to help. There were 160 church members on board the ship returning to the United States, all of whom believe that Ms. Lawrence herself had no reason to warrant the arrest. It is believed that Ms. Lawrence's sudden arrest is the first time in years that an American church member has been detained in Japan. (22nd United Press dispatch)

### After Eleven Days of Fierce Fighting, Greek Troops Seize Korçë, Italian Side Admits Korçë Has Fallen, All Italian Troops Retreat Northwest

LONDON - Korçë, specially selected and meticulously arranged by the Italian side as a base for attacking Greece, has now fallen into the hands of the Greek army. According to recent reports, the elite Italian troops are now retreating in disarray before the pursuing Greek troops. Currently, the front lines in the Pindus region are all within Albanian territory. The resistance of the Italian troops in the coastal Epirus region seems to be collapsing continuously. Military figures here, while praising the glorious victory of the Greek army in defeating a larger force with a smaller one, believe it is a mistake to consider the current Italian defeat as a complete rout or to believe that a large number of Italian troops will be cut off. The Italian air force has been much less active in the past few days, possibly due to the unexpected resistance from the Greek and British air forces. Military supplies of all kinds, along with armaments and munitions seized by British forces from Italian bases in the Western Egyptian desert are being rushed into Greece and used by Greek forces to bombard Italian forces. (22nd Reuters dispatch)

Its vanguard has reached the eastern suburbs of Korçë, temporarily stopping to wait for the main force to descend directly from the eastern slope of the Morava Mountains to take the city together. The Greek army has cut off the road south of Korçë leading to Oskaca and is now sweeping the enemy in the rural areas west of Korçë. The Italian artillery is currently covering the Italian army's retreat along the road to Pogradec, while Korçë is still within range of Italian artillery fire. (22nd Reuters dispatch)

ATHENS - According to a communiqué from the General Headquarters here, the Greek army continued to achieve victories yesterday, capturing seven heavy artillery pieces, four anti-aircraft guns, dozens of machine guns, many mortars, and countless military supplies. In addition, they also occupied food and oil depots. Greek aircraft scouted and bombed the battlefield, with great success. (22nd Reuters dispatch)

ATHENS - It is reported that the Italian troops on the front line are in confusion and retreating along the entire front. According to the latest military intelligence, the Italian strongholds are in danger of being surrounded, not only Korçë, but also Argirokastro. If the Greek army succeeds in flanking east of Argirokastro, it can cut off the communication between this important Italian base and eastern Albania, putting the Italian positions along the coast of Epirus in a precarious situation. Threatened by this new encirclement, the Italian army is now retreating north. Greek observation posts overlooking Korçë see long columns of Italian troops moving out of the city and heading north along the road to Pogradec. This indicates a general retreat of the Italian troops from Korçë. The Greek troops are now advancing victoriously, pursuing the Italian troops who are retreating in disarray along the misty mountain ridges in Albania. The Greek side is now making every effort to completely collapse the Italian troops currently retreating. British and Greek aircraft are constantly patrolling and bombing Italian airfields in Albania on a large scale. At the same time, due to weather conditions, the Italian army seems to have lost its air support. Previously, Italian aircraft had indeed curbed the rapid advance of the Greek army.

SOUTHERN CAPITAL CITY - According to news from the Greek border town here, artillery battles between Italian and Greek forces continued incessantly for the past two days. The Greek air force bombed the Argirokastro Lot airfield, while the Italian air force also bombed western Macedonia. (22nd Transocean dispatch)

ROME - A large number of Italian aircraft are now continuously attacking the entire position of the Arria Sea-Flores. The transportation routes, artillery positions, and troop concentration points behind the Greek positions are also being bombed. The mountain passes and strategic roads in the Bolgrile region are also targets of Italian aircraft. (22nd Transocean dispatch)

ROME - According to the Italian newspaper, fifty Greek soldiers attempted to seize Gaidaro Island but were repelled by three Italian military police. The island is located near the Greek island of Samos and is defended by only a small Italian team of sailors and several military police. The Greek army launched a surprise attack at night, initially only three military police resisted, then sailors joined in and the Greek army began to retreat. (22nd Transocean News Service dispatch)

Greek Troops Enter the City of Korçë, Nationwide Celebration of Victory

ATHENS - According to sources here, a large unit of the Italian army and a large number of military supplies were captured in the battle near Korçë. The Greek army entered Korçë at noon and raised the Greek flag on the city hall. After the Italian army retreated, the municipal authorities formally invited the Greek army to take over. When the Greek army marched in, the masses broke through the cordon and cheered wildly. Currently, the news of the occupation of Korçë has spread loudly throughout every village and town in Greece. In taverns, drinkers are raising their glasses in celebration, and church bells are ringing throughout the country to celebrate. All flags are hanging in the air. The situation in Athens is particularly enthusiastic, with a large number of women kneeling and praying in churches, thanking God for the victory. Greek Prime Minister Metaxas stood on the stone steps of the Greek General Headquarters and announced the occupation of Korçë to the masses. (22nd Reuters dispatch)

Greek Troops Cross the Albanian Border, Cutting off Italian Supply Lines

ATHENS - According to reliable sources, Greek troops have crossed the Albanian border and are advancing rapidly, having cut off the main supply line of the Italian army in Quanta to Argirokastro (within Albania). Elsewhere, Greek troops are advancing towards Korçë in three routes. On the Argirokastro road, Greek troops are advancing in a large number of captured Italian tanks and motorcycles. Another unit of Spartan troops traveled day and night, crossing the Markellari Plateau and cutting off the road in the Korçë area, blocking Italian supplies. The Spartan troops have built positions there, so retreating Italian troops encountered fierce machine gun and mortar fire. An Italian prisoner of war said that when someone shouted "Our rear is cut off" in the army, the entire Italian army became greatly disturbed. The Spartans were a famous brave people of ancient Greece. The number of troops in this battle was far less than the number of Italian troops. Italian tanks and cavalry units flowed towards Korçë. The three miles of road near that place were filled with abandoned Italian trucks and two-wheeled motorcycles, and the escaping Italian troops were strafed or bombed by British and Greek aircraft. Although the Italian army set fire to the abandoned vehicles, it is reported that there were no less than two hundred complete trucks. The Greek commander used radio to solicit drivers and mechanics from all over the country to drive these spoils of war. (22nd United Press dispatch)

More Than Fifty Italian Generals Reportedly Dismissed by the Italian Government

NEW YORK - Columbia Wireless received a broadcast report from the British Broadcasting Corporation stating that after the Italian army's failed invasion of Greece in Albania, more than fifty generals of the army were dismissed by the Italian government. (22nd United Press dispatch)

ATHENS - According to unconfirmed reports from Belgrade, the Greek army occupied Bogradiec on the Urita River in a blitzkrieg. British and Greek aircraft dropped leaflets throughout Albania, urging the Albanians to unite with the victorious Greek army under the exiled Albanian King Zog II to resist Italy. According to reports, sixty senior Italian front-line generals have been dismissed by Mussolini. The rapidly advancing Greek troops are too far from their supply stations, so food is being dropped by British aircraft to supply them. A Greek spokesman in Athens said today that the current strategy of the Greek army is not only to occupy Albanian territory, but also to completely destroy the Italian army that invaded Greece. The spokesman also said, "Our army is advancing according to the planned full-army operational plan, with no retreat, but also not to be lured by the enemy to go deep into a certain place." According to the latest news received this afternoon, the Italian rearguard was in a state of chaos when it withdrew from Korçë. (22nd International dispatch)

British and Italian Air Forces Engage in a Major Battle Over Albania, British Side Achieves Important Victory

CAIRO - Last night, the British side stated that while several squadrons of British bombers were attacking the strategic land and sea military centers of the Italian army from the southern coast of the Red Sea to the interior of Albania, British and Italian air forces had an unprecedented large-scale group air battle in Africa. The British side achieved victory. According to a British official report here, a total of 75 aircraft participated in the air battle, with 15 British aircraft and 60 Italian fighters engaged in fierce fighting over Libya. As a result, 10 Italian aircraft were shot down. Although the number of Italian aircraft far exceeded that of British aircraft, all of the British aircraft that attacked the Italian aircraft and provoked the air battle returned safely to their bases without injury. The official report also stated that British aircraft had launched large-scale night attacks on Asab successively. The city has been engulfed by a large fire, and the flames and smoke can be seen from 80 miles away. (22nd International News Service dispatch)

### A Painful History of the European War (3): Three Protagonists in the French Tragedy (3): Laval's Inability to Cope

This describes the third protagonist in the French tragedy, Laval, who, along with Daladier and Gamelin, is currently being held in a prison near Vichy, awaiting the Supreme Court's verdict on whether they misled the country. The original article was written by the famous French journalist, Saint Jean. From 1935 to 1937, he served as the London bureau chief for the Paris Soir newspaper. As the European situation tightened, he returned to France to work, and after the outbreak of war, he joined the French government's intelligence department. The original article appeared in Harpet's Magazine in the United States, and is now translated below:

France's decisive defeat can be said to be rare in ancient and modern times. Within a very short period of time, military affairs influenced the political situation, and involved many countries. It is difficult to find a similar example in the history of the world. This tragedy will undoubtedly become an important subject of study for the world in the coming years.

Before the invasion of the Netherlands and Belgium, the Western Front was not tense. Therefore, the decisive period of this war can be said to have begun on May 10 and ended on June 13, lasting only thirty-four days. In fact, the decisive time for both sides may have been even shorter. The breakthrough of the French Corap army's line and the disintegration of the main force occurred on May 17. Therefore, no matter how brave the French army was, no matter how sufficient the French military equipment was, it had already been defeated within these seven days.

Given the short time of contact between the two armies, the great pain suffered by France, various bizarre rumors arose. Some said, "France's defeat was due to internal traitors who sold the country." Others said, "A former French prime minister secretly negotiated in Switzerland last winter and betrayed France to Hitler for a few bags of money." These kinds of rumors were, of course, enough to be shocking, but the reality was not like that. The reason for France's defeat was more due to political reasons than military ones.

France's military failure was due to the following reasons: the air force was backward for many years; there were many French pilots who could rival the world's best, but due to insufficient aircraft production, they were still waiting for "planes" to move in the spring of this year; there were very few tanks; the French armaments factories devoted most of their efforts to manufacturing heavy artillery throughout the winter, but did not pay attention to tanks. In fact, heavy artillery was hardly used in this blitzkrieg; and the delay in air defense equipment and the weakness of the intelligence agencies were fully exposed. More importantly, the military authorities stuck to conventions and did not know how to adapt to circumstances. If we say that France had prepared in advance for the European war of 1914, it was not accurate, but at least it was much better prepared than for the European war of 1939, which is undeniable. A group of veterans who had participated in the last European war had rich experience, but their knowledge was not broad enough, and they actually overwhelmed the young officers who were planning new tactics. The cry of "remember the past" was louder than "imagine the future." The Maginot Line was a great project based on the experience of the last trench warfare, using the old to resist the new, believing that it could not only destroy modern invaders, but also sweep away all new military doctrines.

All these shortcomings were seen by the many officials who led France's destiny until its surrender. Prime Minister Laval had been loudly criticizing and sharply pointing out the various sins of France for many years, which made him unpopular, but once he took charge of the government, he was at a loss and unable to save the country from disaster. This strange phenomenon is an important key to understanding the French tragedy, and it is not only related to this prime minister.

On the day of the French army's defeat, May 17, the morale of the nation did not decline. A small victory would have been enough to further inspire them. Laval's government consistently promoted the slogan of "intensifying the war" when he formed his cabinet, and worked hard to carry it out. However, on May 17, Daladier, though disagreeing with him, remained Minister of War, and Gamelin, though distrusted by him, remained in command. Whether the war could be intensified depended on the Minister of War and the Commander-in-Chief whom the Prime Minister wanted to remove, which was truly terrible. Laval gained power by opposing the policies of his predecessor, but he failed to thoroughly eliminate them, and the old forces could still influence the government. In short, Laval only held power for eighty-seven days, and his short-lived cabinet was tragically overthrown. However, during his tenure, he retained people whom he knew to be unreliable. As the ancients said, "If you hate evil, you cannot get rid of it." That was Laval.

Was it that Laval himself had no opinions, so he allowed them to continue to control the war policy? Absolutely not. This prime minister had always been unconventional in his views on national affairs. He had developed a sense of self-confidence before taking office. However, the people he recruited into his cabinet were all mediocre, so it is conceivable whether the opinions they expressed were brilliant.

On March 21, Laval's cabinet was formed. That night, Laval said to his confidants, "I formed the cabinet too early." Hearing this sentence today is strange, because everything has proven that even if he had taken power earlier, it would still have been "too late." In fact, Laval's words had a different meaning. On March 20, the parliament held a closed-door meeting, and many members abstained from voting, showing that they only wanted to "reprimand" Daladier for his mistakes, like a schoolchild, and were unwilling to "dismiss" him immediately. Laval believed that there should be an interim cabinet, and that he should wait a little longer before taking the stage. Unexpectedly, Daladier's influence declined so quickly that it was unexpected. He only received 239 votes of confidence in the National Assembly, and 300 abstained. Knowing that it was difficult to cling to his post, he decided to resign. That afternoon, the president summoned Laval to form a cabinet.

Laval's friends and relatives were all overjoyed when they heard the news. However, it was not only Laval's friends who were happy, but also his political enemies were secretly pleased. The people who were attached to Daladier thought that the new prime minister was only a temporary official, and that once he resigned, Daladier could make a comeback. The members who did not vote for Daladier's confidence that day came to apologize to him and ask for forgiveness. When Laval was looking for people to prepare to form a cabinet, Daladier's political power was gradually expanding again. When Laval heard the news, he had to change his policy. He knew that things would be difficult without Daladier. Because Daladier was the leader of the Radical Party and represented the general public in France. He looked cautious and willing, spoke with a southern accent, and was eloquent, making his words pleasing to the ear, so he was easily moved by soldiers, city dwellers, and rural people.

Laval was the opposite. He looked like a wealthy bourgeois, was short, had a stiff attitude, spoke with a nasal twang, and had a condescending manner when he spoke, making people shy away. When Daladier inspected the Maginot Line, he wore an old soft hat and a large vest, and his appearance was very casual. When Laval went, he was dressed in grand attire and had a dignified attitude. Therefore, Daladier was often popular, while Laval was never popular.

Therefore, on March 21, Laval had to pull his political enemy into the cabinet and reluctantly give him the post of Minister of War; he knew that without cooperating with this man in the soft hat, there would be no way to do anything.

It was not easy for the new prime minister to gain the support of the majority without the backing of a party. Daladier was the leader of the Radical Socialist Party, and had a great influence. Without his support in the cabinet, or in opposition to his party, it would be impossible to give orders. In short, the parliamentary system had long lost its function. Today, it overthrows a prime minister and welcomes the successor to start anew, but tomorrow it forces the successor to retain the predecessor's legacy. In this kind of inconsistent situation, France's true democracy had long existed in name only. (To be continued)

According to the newspapers, Foreign Minister Csáky will deliver a speech to the Foreign Affairs Committees of both houses of Parliament in the next few days on the Vienna agreement.

Hungary Strives to Maintain Friendly Relations with the Soviet Union

Budapest: Hungarian authorities today stated that the main purpose of Hungary's accession to the Tripartite Pact is to establish lasting peace in Europe. A semi-official report stated that Hungary's participation in the Tripartite Pact increases the country's prestige, but also increases Hungary's responsibilities. The purpose of the Tripartite Pact is to prevent the spread of war, and at the same time to build a new order in the three continents. Regarding Hungary's relations with the Soviet Union, the report stated that maintaining friendly relations with the Soviet Union is a key point of Hungarian foreign policy, and Hungary's accession to the Tripartite Pact will further consolidate this relationship. (Haitong Telegram, 22nd)

Roman Authorities Explain the Purpose of the Tripartite Pact

Rome: Local officials said that Hungary's accession to the Tripartite Pact is without reservation, so the full text of the pact does not need to be modified. Hungary is willing to give unlimited support to the three signatory countries of the pact in political and economic terms. Hungary's accession to the Tripartite Pact sets an example for other countries to participate in the construction of a new European order, which proves that the Tripartite Pact for reorganizing Europe is attractive. Local officials continued to explain the purpose of the Tripartite Pact as follows: (1) to limit the expansion of the war and encourage any country not to get involved in the war; (2) to ensure the victory of all countries related to the Tripartite Pact; (3) to encourage other countries to join the Tripartite Pact and work together to build a new order, so as to improve the living standards of all countries in the political and economic fields. Judging from the comments of British newspapers, Britain clearly realizes that it has suffered a new blow in prestige with Hungary's accession to the Tripartite Pact. (Haitong Telegram, 22nd)

Romania's Accession to the Alliance Has No Major Significance

London: A Reuters diplomatic correspondent said that if the news recently released from the German-controlled side is realized, then Romania will follow Hungary in joining the Axis. After Romania was forced to make major sacrifices, the so-called "new order" in Southeast Europe was established. Now the Axis powers have forced Romania to join the alliance and guarantee this "new order" with Hungary. This may be regarded as unreasonable. However, Romania's accession to the Axis may not be as sensational as Hungary's. The Axis powers now have no indication of taking action against Yugoslavia or Bulgaria, and Germany has no evidence of preparing to suddenly help Italy, which is in distress. The Italian campaign against Greece has now reached a critical point, and only strong intervention by Germany can save the situation, but Germany may not have this ability. However, it cannot be said that the Axis powers will disregard Yugoslavia or Bulgaria. If Germany sends troops to Bulgaria to attack Greece, Turkey will recognize that its vital interests are threatened, and will therefore be drawn into the war. As for Germany's propaganda that the Soviet Union will deal with Turkey, there is no basis in fact, and the Turkish President recently reaffirmed the friendly nature of Soviet-Turkish relations.

Still under consideration by the Soviet government. We have reason to believe that this proposal is acceptable to the Soviet Union and is awaiting its reply. We have also proposed a compromise solution to the various issues arising from the Soviet annexation of territory, and have also given appropriate consideration to the existing obligations of the British government. We have also put forward a number of broad proposals to enhance relations between the two countries and to dispel potential misunderstandings. The gist of these has been reported in the newspapers. All of these are intended to establish greater trust between the two governments in political terms. The above-mentioned proposals are still awaiting a reply, so I am unable to continue to comment on this matter at this time," said the British Foreign Secretary.

Speaking of the Vichy government, he said that Hitler is now using his old trick of enticement and intimidation against France. France is not occupied territory, and it is becoming more difficult because of the German deportation of the French from Lorraine. As far as we know, the French protests have had no effect. The British Foreign Secretary went on to say about Greece, that providing Greece with all possible assistance is in accordance with our responsibilities and obligations, and this is the established policy of Great Britain. The three weeks of the Greek-Italian war have proven that we had reason to admire Greece when it rejected the Italian ultimatum. The British Foreign Secretary went on to say that Mussolini claimed that the Greek-Italian war was entirely Greece's fault, but although Mussolini has been trying to tell the Italian people that things are going smoothly, the Italian people have already heard the news of the destruction of Italian warships in Taranto and have seen the shame of military failure brought about by the ambitions of their leaders. They are gradually becoming unmoved and feel that their leaders are merely parrot-like in their monotonous praise of the country. If there is a naked war of plunder in the world, it is this war waged against a weak nation. Now this small nation has shown the world its courage and spirit in defending freedom, which is more powerful than a large army, as its ancient history has already shown. In world history,

Greece's reputation is higher than ever today, and Italy's reputation has fallen lower than ever today. There are many absurdities and absurdities in Mussolini's words, especially the statement that the culprit of the war is Britain. His intention seems to be to say that the Italians' battle is caused by Britain. This statement must be refuted. Who should bear the responsibility for the Anglo-German war? The documents are available for review. Our conscience is clear. As for Italy, Britain or other countries have never given the Italian government the pretext that Italy will be attacked. It was Mussolini who led his people into the war a few days before the collapse of France, and it had nothing to do with others. Mussolini did this solely in the hope of a victory without labor and a quick settlement. This kind of stabbing in the back against France will forever be a pre-arranged

cold-blooded conspiracy. From Mussolini's argument, it can be seen that Mussolini is deeply resentful that Greece rejected his olive branch on October 28. His so-called Greek preparation to join forces with Britain to attack Italy is just a pretext. Mussolini claimed that he had obtained the consent of the German leader to directly participate in the attack on Britain. The British government must recognize that Italy's participation in the bombing of women and children is simply a show of brutality and has no reason at all, and should be given due attention. Britain is still waiting for the Italian army to attack from Libya. The number of British soldiers and weapons in Egypt has greatly increased. All important points in Egypt and Sudan are heavily guarded, so Egypt and the Near East are now increasingly confident. The British Foreign Secretary finally spoke of America's active assistance to Britain, saying that arms imports are constantly flowing in, and the American President recently stated that about 60% of the weapons made in America will be supplied to Britain. (Reuters Telegram, 22nd)

### Duisburg, a Major German Inland Port, Attacked from the Air; Transportation Network in Western Germany Heavily Damaged

London: On Wednesday night and Thursday morning, British bombers heavily bombed the inland port of Duisburg-Ruhrort in Germany, causing heavy damage. Duisburg-Ruhrort is the world's largest inland port, extremely important, and the main meeting point of railways, waterways, and bridges in the entire industrial area on the right bank of the Rhine in the Ruhr area. This time, the British Air Force carried out a violent attack on the port, lasting for several hours, dropping extremely heavy bombs, which must have destroyed its important raw materials. According to the pilots' reports, there were many anti-aircraft guns concentrated at the port. The American planes flew low under the range of the artillery fire, and overlooked the target, which was clearer. They then aimed and dropped heavy bombs. The target was hit and damaged and caught fire. At the same time, British coastal bombers attacked enemy air bases in Brittany, Normandy, and Picardy in France. A Blenheim-type British plane shot down a German bomber that was apparently taking off to attack Britain when it was preparing to bomb an airfield near Artos. The British plane saw this twin-engine bomber at an altitude of 5,000 feet, with its navigation lights not turned off, and launched a head-on attack. The front and rear turrets fired together, and the enemy plane was seen to fall straight down and crash next to the airfield where it had just taken off, and caught fire. A Hudson-type plane from the British Coastal Command also attacked an oil factory in Flushing, the Netherlands, causing heavy damage. (Reuters Telegram, 22nd)

### German Military Report

Berlin: German military experts issued a supplementary war report to Haitong News Agency, stating that according to the German military report yesterday, German torpedo boats sank a total of 11,000 tons of British warships, including six destroyers and two submarines. In addition, 212,000 tons of merchant ships were also sunk. The German Air Force has been attacking Britain for ten weeks. In the 75 days, German planes have continuously bombed various parts of Britain, destroying its various military targets. Harbors, airfields, and armaments factories have been bombed repeatedly and none have been spared. German planes have also been able to reach the Atlantic Ocean, strengthening the blockade of the British Isles. In addition to bombing the military industrial center of the Midlands on a large scale recently, German planes have also bombed harbor facilities and military targets in Weymouth, Northampton, and Bournemouth. British planes attacked western and northern France and western German cities on the night of the 20th, and the damage suffered was insignificant. (Haitong Telegram, 22nd)

### Yuan Ludeng Issues Statement Regarding the Orphanage

Yuan Ludeng, chairman and director of the Shanghai Orphanage, issued the following statement yesterday because a certain newspaper still had some misunderstandings about the truth: This orphanage and its colleagues have put in the utmost effort to educate and care for more than 600 orphans. Its financial difficulties have been alleviated by the continuous donations from kind people from all walks of life. Raising funds is a difficult task every day. All donations and accounts have been published in the Shen and Xin newspapers to show credibility. I and all the directors of the orphanage are fully responsible for the economic expenditures in the orphanage and can be audited at any time. As for the so-called "malfeasance" and "bribery," major newspapers are trying to cover it up, which is unfounded and unnecessary. The orphanage has its own strict position. As for the matter of rewarding reporter Jiang Shilin of the Shanghai United News Agency with 2,000 yuan, because the orphanage has held charity competitions in the past, Mr. Jiang has been running around planning, serving and promoting, and the news agency's finances have always been tight, as a demonstration of human mutual assistance, so there was the motivation to give this subsidy to help them succeed and reward their hard work. However, because the outside world has already misunderstood the orphanage, Mr. Jiang has returned the full amount to the orphanage, so it has nothing to do with the reporters of various newspapers at all. In order to prevent rumors from spreading and misunderstanding the truth, I solemnly declare again that if there are any more criticisms in the future, I am busy with affairs and it is difficult to have the time to answer them one by one.

Famous Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition Still Has Today and Tomorrow

The Jingwu Sports Association in the Cishu Building on Nanjing Road is holding an exhibition of calligraphy and paintings by more than 100 famous artists to raise funds for the Youyou Orphanage and Volunteer School. Since its opening, the number of buyers has been unprecedented. It was originally scheduled to end on the 20th, but due to the large number of exhibits and the limited space, all of them could not be displayed. The exhibition has been extended for four days. There are still today and tomorrow. Famous calligraphers and painters such as Wu Hufan, Ma Gongyu, Chen Xiaodie, Zheng Wuchang, Wang Yachen, etc., have new works added.

### Food: Over 20,000 More Bags of Foreign Rice Arrive, Japanese Merchants Hawk Annam Rice in the Market, Speculative Rice Merchants Are Greatly Discouraged

Foreign rice continues to arrive in Shanghai. Yesterday, the Jardine Matheson's Dingsheng Wheel arrived with 7,527 bags from Hong Kong and docked at the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. The French Company's Xijiang Wheel arrived directly from Saigon with 1,000 tons, totaling 18,100 bags. It also arrived at the port at around 5:00 pm yesterday and docked at buoys 11 and 12. Unloading and transshipment will begin today. Furthermore, the Taikoo Company's Jinan Wheel, which arrived with 7,153 bags from Hong Kong the day before, was reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the ship also had another 4,281 bags of foreign rice, totaling a huge 11,434 bags. This is a correction.

The arrival of foreign rice yesterday led to brisk sales and the market has already stabilized. However, market rumors are unfavorable to buyers, and the speculative rush business of "balloons" cannot be implemented due to the straight-line decline in market prices. However, some speculators have turned from being long to short, and are using their old trick of selling short and buying short. Although there is no continued selling by Chinese and foreign merchants in new transactions, Japanese merchants are leveraging their favorable position in Vietnam, the abundance of ship space, and the low cost of water and insurance. The night before and yesterday, they were canvassing for transactions in the market. Although there were no formal transactions in the market, it is heard that there have been telegrams and it is possible that there will be trial listings arriving in Shanghai in early November. As a result, people's hearts were immediately agitated, and the difference between forward and spot goods was small in the early morning. After noon, prices fell again. Although the late close was pulled up by shorts covering their positions, the result was that both forward and spot goods were more than one yuan lower than the night before. No. 2 West Buy spot goods were 82.78 yuan in the morning and 82 yuan in the afternoon, 1.78 yuan lower than 83.78 yuan the night before. November was 82.5 yuan in the morning and 81.8 yuan in the afternoon, 1.5 yuan lower. December was 80.08 yuan, 1 yuan lower. No. 1 December was from 84.5 yuan to 83.5 yuan, and there were still bids at 82.5 yuan. Xiaowen was 79.5 yuan in the morning and 79 yuan in the afternoon, also 1 yuan lower. The total amount returned to the market throughout the day was more than 700 tons, with 7,000 bags of spot rice.

The arrival of new japonica and wild rice tea seeds is not prosperous, but sales are also not smooth, so the supply and demand are balanced. If the original sentence is used, the new japonica still opens at 92 yuan and 90 yuan, the bucket sees 88 yuan to 86 yuan, the wild rice is 89 yuan, the Lvzong is 81 yuan, and the Duyang top is similar.

The market for glutinous rice is average, but because there is not much stock in the market, the price also lacks difference. Yili Baiyuan is 85 yuan and 83 yuan, Hong Kong Baiyuan is 78.5 yuan and 75 yuan.

### Discussions of Increasing Flour Mill Prices Again, Japanese Factories Ship Flour to the North

The flour market is clearly stable but secretly tight. Since the price of rice has been expensive, the current demand for flour in this street has increased frequently, and there are even inquiries from Hakka merchants. Although a small amount of foreign flour has arrived in Shanghai, it has not been able to supply a large amount, so the situation is gradually tightening in secret. It is heard that the factory plans to increase the factory price again because the raw materials are rising again and cannot be purchased. It is currently under discussion. As a result, old car shops and warehouses have greedy hoarders, and the price must be 19.45 yuan. Foreign flour is also strong at the same time. Shuangying brand is sold at 19 yuan. 250 bags were collected from this street. As for Huachang's wholesale of more than 8,000 bags of No. 2 flour, the price is still 17 yuan, and the price for Hakka merchants is still 18.5 yuan, but there is no formal supply.

As for flour being transported to Tianjin, foreign ships have been gone for a long time, but there are still quite a few Japanese ships transporting it. All the goods are exported by the Japanese Sanxing Factory. Yesterday, 6,000 bags of flour were transported to Weihaiwei, which was returned goods (i.e., exchanged for raw peanuts transported from Weihaiwei). Yesterday, the Jardine Matheson's Dingsheng Wheel transported 800 bags of foreign flour from Hong Kong.

The trend of wheat is also secretly strong. Because the arrival of goods has been rare for a long time, Huachang cannot buy goods, and the source of foreign wheat is also hindered. Therefore, the factory continues to release prices to attract distant goods. It is heard that the Japanese factory also plans to collect at a price of 28 yuan and order from merchants again.

Yesterday's exports included 4,000 bags of corn to Weihaiwei and 300 bags to Yantai.

### Finance: Foreign Exchange is Released into the Market, Increasing in Quantity

Yesterday's foreign exchange market: HSBC's listed price remained unchanged. The dark market for British and American exchange rates saw a slight softening today. Yesterday, the telegram said that the Japanese army would actively advance south and there was talk of landing in Thailand. More households released more, while the number of "eaters" among peeling households except for foreign banks was very small. In the afternoon, the amount of Hong Kong electricity was huge and was once priced at 5.96875 yuan for the US exchange rate. However, the result was still stable, 0.015625 and 0.03125 yuan lower than the previous day, totaling 3 shillings 765625 for British gold and 5.9375 yuan for US exchange. The forward US exchange rate was squared off, and the forward British gold was slightly pulled apart.

Foreign Banks Still Buying

In the early morning, London's large bars, both near and far term, fell by 0.0625. New York's silver price remained flat. London's raw gold remained stable. The exchange rates of British to US and Shanghai were flat, and the US to British and Shanghai were without a market. The Central's listed prices for various exchange rates remained the same. The bank's morning opening price for spot sales was 3 shillings 75 for British gold and 5.90625 yuan for US exchange, unchanged from the previous day's late close. After opening, Chinese merchants and speculators slightly squeezed out, and the market became firm, with November at 5.9375 yuan. At the same time, the banks also sold spot US exchange at a price of 5.9375 yuan. HSBC's listed price was announced and did not move. The silver balancing tax was announced to be 0.25% lower. After that, Hong Kong Electricity sold some US exchange, and the price for this month was still 5.90625 yuan. The above were all absorbed by foreign banks, and because their appetite was not weak, the potential was loose but still stable. Until noon, the rumors that the Japanese army was planning to land in Thailand did not affect people's hearts. At that time, a certain US bank went out to tell the US exchange rate for this month as 5.9375 yuan. The noon closing price was 3 shillings 765625 for British gold and 5.9375 yuan for US exchange, 0.025625 and 0.03125 yuan lower than the morning opening of each dread.

Hong Kong Fiercely Selling

In the late market, Hong Kong Electricity fiercely sold, and the US exchange rate once reached 5.96875 yuan. Objects Hong Kong Electricity sold the first order of the next month for 3 shillings 765625, and also sold the same month US exchange for 5.96875 yuan. Later, China Bank Jincheng came in with the same month US exchange, and the US Bank settled it at 5.9375 yuan. Speculators also sold to the benefit of both at 5.9375 yuan. The late close was 3 shillings 765625 for British gold spot and for this month, and 3 shillings 75 for December. The US exchange rate was consistently 5.9375 yuan, 0.015625 higher than the British's hard one. The forward was unchanged, and the forward US exchange rate was 0.03125 longer than the current.

Hong Kong US Exchange Rate Softened

Hong Kong, 22nd (Friday) Electric: This morning, the exchange market opened bullish and stable, and there were no changes in any exchange rates (the British exchange spot closed hard at 1 shilling and 3 pence yesterday, and the forward remained unchanged). At 11:30, it was announced that it was flat. The US exchange spot rate was hard at 0.0625, at 23 and 6875. The rest remained unchanged. The market opened steadily at 2:30 pm. The Shanghai exchange spot rate fell by 1.5 yuan to 396.5 yuan, and the rest remained unchanged.

Tianjin Federal Notes Plummet

Tianjin, 22nd (Friday) Electric: This morning, the exchange market opened and reported loose. The London telegraphic transfer was hard at 0.15625, at 4 pence 15625. The New York telegraphic transfer was 25 longer, at 6.0625 yuan. The Shanghai exchange rate fell sharply by 4 yuan to 88.5 yuan. The "Federal Notes" dark market was cheap at 4.25 yuan, at 92 yuan.

### Gold Market Plunges Near Noon

Yesterday, the cash gold market was initially stable, but a sudden drop occurred around noon. From 11:30 AM, rumors of Japan actively invading the south spread, and under the pressure of large-scale foreign exchange selling in Hong Kong, the market shifted from stable to loose. The sentiment of all parties became weary. Opening lower than the previous day's decline at 5,670 yuan, subsequent trading was mostly dominated by retail investors, with price fluctuations of only a few dozen yuan, once rising to 5,682 yuan. Unexpectedly, at noon, rumors of profit-taking sales suddenly emerged, and foreign exchange rates were reported to be strong, leading to a downward trend. Securities firms, banks, and foreign exchange merchants aggressively sold. In the afternoon, a certain money shop sold down to 5,622 yuan. However, foreign exchange was soon absorbed by HSBC and other British banks, abruptly halting the decline with a slight rebound. The price also increased due to aggressive buying from cash shops, ultimately closing at 5,635 yuan, a drop of 45 yuan. The total daily transaction volume was 3,670 taels. The cash price was 6-7 yuan lower than the forward price. No forward trading was reported. Jewelry gold and customs gold remained stable.

Gold Drops 45 Yuan

The market opened with slightly higher foreign exchange rates, leading to some fatigue in sentiment. At the opening, banks quoted 30 taels at 5,670 yuan, 10 yuan lower than the previous day's closing. Subsequently, due to selling pressure from securities firms, the price continued to fall by 10 yuan, with banks trading 20 taels, reaching 5,660 yuan. However, at this time, retail investors saw the low price and rushed to buy, causing the price to rebound. Banks bought 30 taels, reaching 5,682 yuan. But soon, securities firms resumed selling, causing the price to fall again. Gold shops sold 20 taels to banks at only 5,652 yuan. At noon closing, banks traded 10 taels at only 5,657 yuan. The afternoon situation was lackluster, with banks continuously selling. Initially, banks traded 20 taels at 5,625 yuan. Later, securities firms absorbed some, rising by 20 yuan. Securities firms bought 30 taels from banks at 5,645 yuan, while banks sold 20 taels to securities firms at only 5,620 yuan. Before the closing, gold shops bought in, potentially halting the decline. They bought 30 taels from banks at 5,640 yuan, and then 10 taels at 5,635 yuan, as the late closing price. After the closing, it was heard that trading occurred around 5,620 yuan, a drop of 45 yuan compared to the previous day. The daily fluctuation was 50 yuan. The selling price of cash shops' own brand gold was several dozen yuan higher than the spot price, while the buying price was 30 yuan lower. The spot price was 50-60 yuan lower than the listed price, with little trading.

Jewelry Gold Remains Unchanged

The selling price of jewelry gold in silver shops remained unchanged. Da Tong Heng quoted 580 yuan per tael, with Xin Tong Heng offering similar prices. The buying price was reduced by about 30 yuan.

US Dollar Continues to Deteriorate

In the foreign currency market, spot prices fluctuated downwards. British and American gold pounds also fell by one yuan each. British gold notes remained thinly traded, with prices remaining stable. US dollar notes continued to deteriorate, falling to 16 yuan 3 jiao 6 fen in the evening market, a decrease of 1 jiao 7 fen compared to the previous day's closing. Hong Kong dollar notes were firm, rising to 4 yuan in the evening market. Japanese gold notes and Korean notes had balanced supply and demand, with prices remaining stable. The former remained at 1 yuan 5 jiao 3 fen, while the latter remained at 1 yuan 1 jiao 5 fen.

### Yarn Market: Speculative Sentiment Weakens; Cotton Yarn Plummets, "Double Horse" Brand Falls Below 1,200 Yuan

The yarn market continued to decline, with a particularly strong downward trend. This was due to speculators anticipating a fall, leading to unanimous downward sentiment. At the same time, actual sales were relatively weak. Rumors of Western buying benefited short sellers, leading to extremely active selling and a surge in short positions. The market's holdings loosened, and the market gradually declined. The final price for 20-count "Double Horse" brand yarn broke below the 1,200 yuan mark. Major players and banks remained calm and unmoved. Today, 940 bales of yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.

Spot yarn trading was sluggish due to unfavorable conditions, with most people expecting a fall and leaning towards selling. The opening price for 20-count "Double Horse" brand yarn was 1,220 yuan, quickly falling to 1,217 yuan. News of stable foreign exchange rates then caused it to rise again to 1,213 yuan. However, as prices rose, short selling became even more active, and the market turned downward again to 1,212 yuan. The price fluctuated around 1,210 yuan for a long time. Later, various rumors circulated, and selling became more intense, breaking below the 1,200 yuan mark in an instant, closing at 1,198 yuan. According to half-day transaction statistics, 6,230 bales were traded. The price of 20-count "Double Horse" brand yarn fell by 30 yuan. The amount bought by each group is listed below:

Hong Kong: 6,125 bales
Same Trade: 150 bales

Total: 6,230 bales

### Cotton Prices Remain Difficult to Ease

The spot cotton situation is bleak, as the sluggish yarn market has discouraged manufacturers from buying. However, inventories are gradually decreasing, so sentiment remains strong, and prices are difficult to ease. The overall situation is one of advancing and retreating with difficulty.

In the foreign cotton market, the New York cotton market was closed yesterday for Thanksgiving, and the entire United States was closed. The Indian market was also closed, with forecasts predicting a drop of more than two rupees.

Trading in foreign cotton in Shanghai has been quiet lately, with factories showing less interest in purchasing. Traders are also unwilling to sell their goods cheaply, so trading on the market has been slow all day.

### Reasons for the Sharp Fall in Yarn Prices Said to Be Related to the Increase in "Unified Tax" on Cotton Cloth

Flowers do not always bloom, and the moon is not always full. The booming scene of cotton yarn is gradually fading as in the past. Consider that daily trading often involved 5,000-6,000 bales, but yesterday, only 3,675 bales of 20-count "Double Horse" brand yarn were traded, a decrease of about 2,000 bales compared to the previous day. The price rose slightly from the opening price of 1,239 yuan to 1,242 yuan in the mid-morning, but it was clearly weak and powerless. The closing price then fell back to 1,236 yuan. This was the market on the 21st. Today (the 22nd, as the author is writing), the opening price followed the influence of the previous afternoon's after-hours trading, opening at only 1,220 yuan. It briefly rose to 1,223 yuan in the middle of the day, but ultimately could not sustain the rise and gradually fell to 1,217 yuan, 1,211 yuan, and then to a low of 1,209 yuan. (Note: The final closing price was 1,198 yuan.)

Interviewing about the reasons for the sharp fall in yarn prices, the common observations are: (1) Actual sales are again stagnant; (2) Foreign cotton news is declining; (3) Cotton yarn stockpiles remain thick; (4) The transport of goods to the mainland via the Burma Road has not yet been realized; (5) Seasonal export orders are falling. The aforementioned five points are known to everyone who is involved in the cotton yarn market.

There is also a major reason for the "sharp fall in yarn prices," which is that the unified factory tax on cotton cloth will be increased starting next month (December 1st). Therefore, factories such as Shenxin and Xinyu have already published notices urging customers with cotton cloth factory warehouse receipts to clear their stocks before the end of this month, otherwise the change in the unified tax rate will be borne by the customers. This "death warrant" has had an impact on the cotton yarn market. Customers holding cotton yarn factory receipts, fearing that the cotton yarn tax rate will also change, are reluctant to ship goods and are trying to sell them. As the number of holdings increases, the sentiment of those who are long is shrinking. In addition, there are rumors in the market that Abe is going to Chongqing to seek peace, leading to a chorus of selling, and the yarn price immediately plunged. According to discussions among industry insiders, given the current situation and environment, the price of 20-count "Double Horse" brand yarn will likely not be able to hold at 1,200 yuan. Therefore, outside speculators are following the lead of industry insiders and going short. At the same time, scalpers are gradually giving up, and the volume of transactions is decreasing day by day, no longer as vibrant as it was in the middle of last month. In such an environment, artificial manipulation and the technique of feigning retreat are only fleeting. (Ju)

### Securities: Domestic Debt Soars, Many Bonds Reach New Peaks

In the after-hours securities market, yesterday's market continued to rise, with Classes A, B, C, and E all reaching new high prices. Class C once broke through 4 yuan, and Class E also reached as high as 4 yuan. However, due to the excessive rise, it triggered profit-taking by long positions and a surge in short selling, leading to a pullback of five or six jiao. However, it was still several jiao to one yuan higher than the previous day. The large increase followed by a small pullback was due to the floating long positions taking profits immediately. The large-scale absorption by overseas Chinese was partly due to the strong atmosphere of peace and partly due to the abundance of idle funds, making it easier to raise the market price. Yesterday morning, buyers such as Jiafu, Hengkang, Xinhua, and Defu were all buying on behalf of the financial sector or overseas Chinese. Companies such as Jiufeng, Changji, Hengfu, Zhenkang, Hongda, Datongkang, etc., were either covering shorts or had investment needs, and were also very excited. Companies such as Tongshun, Renchang, Shengda, Zhongfu, Datong, and Lianyi were either cutting long positions or going short, and mostly failed.

### Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Sentiment Weak, "Dragon Head" Fine Cloth Plummets

The factory cloth market was flat yesterday, which was due to the continuous depreciation of yarn prices and weak sentiment. However, Cantonese and Hong Kong merchants were actively selling spot goods, and Zhejiang merchants were also actively advancing goods, so demand was strong. As a result, the selling price fell only slightly. White goods, coarse and fine cloth, twill, and colored cloth fell by one jiao to two jiao and a half per piece. Yuchou, gongduan, and bleached cloth from factories such as Lunchang and Yihe were scarce, and each file was raised by two jiao and a half to five jiao per piece. Cantonese and Hong Kong merchants handled more than 500 pieces of poplin, bleached cloth, coarse cloth, colored cloth, etc., and Fujian and Zhejiang merchants handled more than 200 pieces of bleached cloth, colored cloth, colored twill, etc. About 600 pieces of various goods were traded on this street.

Mid-range fine cloth fell by six or seven jiao, and fine twill fell by only two jiao and a half. Serge fell by two fen, and Junzi Serge closed at one yuan and six fen. Because the industry insiders' sentiment remained firm, while outsiders were selling, "Dragon Head" fell the most.

Yesterday, the peanut oil market initially continued to flourish in the morning due to inquiries from Hong Kong merchants for spot goods, and sentiment continued to improve. The market price was half a yuan higher than the previous day. In the afternoon, however, large-scale stockpilers took advantage of the high prices to release forward contracts, and general scalpers switched direction at the sight of the wind. The market atmosphere suddenly became gloomy, and the market price gradually declined. As a result, the price of spot goods was maintained, while forward contracts fell by two yuan.

### North and South Goods: Preserved Mustard Greens Source at Risk of Interruption, Price High Due to Large External Fees

Sichuan preserved mustard greens have recently been transported directly from Hankou, but external fees are extremely large, so the number of arrivals is small. The market inventory is very thin, and the market price is quite high, selling for 280 yuan. If there are no further arrivals, there will inevitably be a shortage, and there is no hope of easing in the future market.

### Sugar Market: Taikoo White Sugar Softens Again; The Outlet of Domestic Sugar Is Controlled

### Beauty Wins Chinese Essay Award, Immediately Flies to Chongqing for Sightseeing; Chairman Chiang and Wife Will Host Her; Winners Awarded in New York; Essay Concerns "Our Stakes in China's Future"

Many prominent figures in American society, in order to promote public concern for China, recently held a Chinese essay contest titled "Our Stakes in China's Future." The winner of the first prize, Ms. Disin from New Jersey, received US$1,200 and a free trip to Chongqing, China, aboard a Clipper flying boat, where Chairman Chiang and Madame Chiang will host her. The second prize went to Mr. Cole from Ohio, who received US$750, and the third prize went to Ms. Alfred from California.

Grand Banquet Held in New York

This competition, sponsored by the Continental Corporation, recently held a banquet at the Ford Motor Exhibition Hall at the New York World's Fair to host the winners and present the awards. At the banquet, Admiral Yarnell, former commander of the US Navy's Asiatic Fleet, delivered a speech stating that the United States has a vital interest in the Far Eastern situation. Other guests who gave speeches included Pearl S. Buck, former president of Xiangya Medical College, Mr. Angel, and Mr. Pan Lai, president of Continental Corporation.

### US Restricts Citizens' Travel to the Far East

According to foreign sources yesterday, during the current period when the Far Eastern crisis has not been completely eliminated, the US government has strict restrictions on issuing passports to people requesting to travel to the Far East. It is said that many Americans want to travel to the Far East every day, but they are all denied the issuance of this certificate. To apply to the State Department for a passport, one must state the reason for travel. If the applicant is a businessman, there is still hope for approval. If the nature of the trip is tourism, it is generally prohibited. As for women and children, it is absolutely impossible to obtain this travel passport.

### Shanghai-Vietnam Navigation Maintained as Usual

Since Japanese troops attempted to land in Saigon, the situation in Vietnam has suddenly become tense. The Chinese government has ordered the blockade of traffic between Qiyue and has stopped issuing travel passports. All cargo and mail deliveries have been interrupted. However, according to the Daguan News Agency's investigation, shipping between Shanghai and Vietnam is currently still being maintained. The French Post Company's cargo ship, S.S. Kindia, arrived in Shanghai from Saigon with a large shipment of foreign rice the day before yesterday and has already completed unloading. It is scheduled to set sail from the Shun Tai Wharf in Hongkou on the 25th (Monday), directly heading to Saigon and Haiphong. The ship only carries more than 5,000 tons of cotton yarn and cloth and does not carry passengers. Also, the company's Xijiang ship arrived in Shanghai from Saigon yesterday evening, carrying more than 14,200 bags of foreign rice from Saigon, and is moored at the 11th and 12th floating pontoons. Whether subsequent voyages will continue depends on the development of the situation in Vietnam.

### Shanghai Branches of Four Banks (Central, China, Communications, and Agriculture) Do Not Reduce Interest Rates

Commercial banks in Shanghai, in view of the abundance of idle funds and the lack of proper investment channels, have implemented reductions in interest rates on demand deposits in order to avoid wasting interest. In addition to the Shanghai, Zhejiang Industrial, Jin Cheng, Continental, Salt Industry, Zhongnan, and Guohua banks, and the Four Banks Savings Association, which have already implemented this, the Zhejiang Xingye Bank has decided, due to market conditions, to change the interest rate on demand deposits to an annual rate of 2.5% starting on December 1. As for the Shanghai branches of the Central, China, Communications, and Agriculture banks, they are not taking any interest rate reduction actions. It is said that the deposits absorbed by these four banks have long been transferred to the interior. It is reported that the four banks have recently made significant investments in the interior, developing transportation and the economy in the southwest.

### Ningbo Plague Eradicated, Shanghai Not Affected

The Jianghai Customs' announcement of implementing plague inspection measures on ships sailing from Zhejiang to Shanghai was due to the outbreak of plague in Ningbo. Shanghai and Ningbo are only a night's journey away, and to prevent infection, a strict inspection system is being implemented on ships sailing from Zhejiang to Shanghai to ensure safety. Currently, there are no direct ships between Shanghai and Ningbo, and those who transfer to ships to Shanghai via other ports have to undergo a considerable journey within Zhejiang Province, which is very unsuitable for the bodies of plague patients. Due to these reasons, Shanghai is expected not to be affected. It is now known that the Ningbo plague has been eradicated, so it can be said that this port can rest assured. The Jianghai Customs' quarantine measures for Zhejiang ships have not actually been implemented.

### Travelers Passing Through Zha Pu Face Many Dangers

Since the Shanghai-Ningbo shipping line was blockaded, passengers returning to and from have been detouring through Zha Pu. According to people coming from Zha Pu who witnessed the scene, the Japanese army, under the pretext of preventing the plague and preventing other actions, acted in a very frightened manner. Therefore, within a few days, they blockaded the Qiantang River, prohibiting ships from traveling to and from eastern Zhejiang. Chinese people, unaware of the details, still sailed their ships over. When the Japanese army saw the ships approaching the shore, they immediately fired small steel cannons at them, sinking the ships. Many people were injured and drowned. However, those who were not injured tried to escape by swimming. As they approached the shore, the Japanese army drove them back into the water and strafed them with machine guns, causing them all to perish miserably. Therefore, travelers going to and from should not detour through Zha Pu again to avoid danger.

### Draft Regulations for Leases in the French Concession Drawn Up; Residents May Express Opinions, Which Will Be Submitted to the Consul-General for Review

Mr. Duc, chairman of the French Concession Housing Rent Research Committee, recently distributed the draft regulations on the leasing, subleasing, and transfer of real estate within the concession to the committee members for study. Residents of the French Concession who wish to express their opinions on the draft decree to Mr. Li Jia, secretary of the committee, at the Bureau of Public Works, 375 Avenue Joffre, are welcome to do so. All opinions from committee members and other residents should be submitted to the French Consul-General after December 17, 1940. The Consul-General will decide, within his authority, the most effective measures to reduce the housing rent burden on residents. The reasons for drafting these regulations are as follows:

Reasons

The French Consul-General in Shanghai, in accordance with Article 13 of the organizational charter of the Shanghai French Concession Bureau of Public Works promulgated by Decree No. 27 of January 15, 1927, promulgated the "Regulations on the Leasing, Subleasing, and Transfer of Real Estate within the Shanghai French Concession," along with the following reasons: Since the outbreak of the war, the crowding of the city and economic panic have led to speculation and abuse of rights. Authorities in various countries around the world have had to take special measures, and the provincial governments and special municipal governments of China have also invoked the provisions of Article 161 of the Land Law and various other articles, and have also restricted the principles of freedom of contract and private agreement in accordance with special measures to maintain public order. In order to maintain peace and tranquility in this concession, it is necessary to take emergency measures. Therefore, these regulations are specially formulated for the public to abide by.

### Command of the Volunteer Corps Will Be Taken Over by Mann; Colonel Henby Scheduled to Leave Shanghai

Colonel Henby, commander of the Shanghai Municipal Council Volunteer Corps, has resigned from his position as commander of the Volunteer Corps due to his impending return to his home country next spring. He is scheduled to leave Shanghai for England in early February next year. The vacant position of commander of the Volunteer Corps will be taken over by Major Mann. Originally, the headquarters of the Volunteer Corps had one commander and two deputy commanders. Major Mann was originally the deputy commander.

At that time, the commander of the Volunteer Corps will be Major Mann, and the deputy commander will be Major Badeley.

### Zhejiang Province Increases Bus Fares on All Highways

According to transportation sources, the Zhejiang Provincial Highway Transportation Company has recently increased bus fares to 1 jiao 4 fen per kilometer due to the limited supply and high prices of gasoline, as well as the continued rise in social prices, in order to maintain balance. This has been implemented since the middle of this month.

### Yesterday's Meeting of Various Charitable Organizations - Resolution on Winter Relief Policy - Increase Efforts to Raise Funds Due to High Prices - Establish Half-Shelters and Provide Rice and Clothing

Various charitable organizations in Shanghai, considering the arrival of winter and the high rice prices, which will inevitably increase the number of impoverished people suffering from cold and hunger, convened a joint meeting at the Gong De Lin in Baker Road at 6:00 PM yesterday to discuss expanding relief efforts. Attendees included representatives from over ten organizations, such as the Refugee Relief Association, the Shanghai Charity Relief Association, Renji Hall, the Chinese Red Cross, and the Red Swastika Society. They discussed issues such as expanding fundraising for winter relief, and the results were very satisfactory.

High Prices and Increased Poverty

A reporter from Da Zhong News Agency inquired yesterday with a certain Mr. of Shiji Hall about the arrangements for this year's winter relief. The reply was as follows: "This year's cost of living in Shanghai is almost double that of last year. Furthermore, due to the Japanese blockade and the inability to transport raw materials from the interior to Shanghai, many factories in Shanghai have been forced to lay off workers or reduce their workforce. Due to these two reasons, the number of impoverished people has greatly increased. The cost of winter relief has also increased due to high prices. For example, a set of cotton clothes that cost only about three yuan last year now costs no less than seven or eight yuan. Therefore, it is necessary to step up fundraising for winter relief. We hope that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will generously donate to support this charitable cause."

Five Aspects of Winter Relief Measures

The specific measures for this year's winter relief are divided into the following aspects: (1) Relief for the Hidden Poor; (2) Establishment of Shelters; (3) Distribution of Porridge and Rice; (4) Distribution of Steamed Buns; (5) Distribution of Clothing. Regarding the relief work for the hidden poor, we will conduct a thorough investigation to identify those who are in dire need of relief due to hunger and cold but find it difficult to openly beg. We will provide them with clothing and rice. Shelters are held every winter as a regular practice, but this year they will only accommodate the elderly, weak, and disabled. The distribution of steamed buns has been implemented on a trial basis since last year and has achieved good results. This year, we will continue to implement it.

Two Resolutions on Clothing Distribution Measures

Regarding the specific measures for clothing distribution, over ten charitable organizations in Shanghai had already agreed at a joint meeting held at Renji Hall the day before yesterday (the 21st). The measures are as follows: (1) To prevent the recipients from selling the distributed clothing, the clothing will be distributed by the charitable organizations and marked with a clear sign. (2) Private donations for clothing distribution must be given only to those who are confirmed to be poor. The estimated total number of clothing items to be distributed this winter is approximately five thousand, but it depends on the availability of funds. In short, let us not forget the impoverished people crying from hunger and cold and extend a helping hand. It is also an expression of human compassion.

### New Stamps - To Be Issued on New Year's Day

After the implementation of the increase in domestic postage rates, the printing of new stamps has been undertaken by the Hong Kong China Bookstore. The process is now mostly completed. It is reported that the printing plate is still the original plate kept by the former Beiping Printing Bureau. However, the colors have changed slightly. There are two denominations, four cents and eight cents. The issue date has been set for New Year's Day next year. At that time, the General Post Office will distribute them to post offices nationwide for public use. The old stamps can also be used in the same way.

### Hongkou Residents, Startled Birds, Experience Another Disturbance - Investigation Reveals Japanese Drunk Randomly Firing a Gun - Outside Rumors Already Exist - Investigation Confirms Inaccuracy

The Zi Lin Daily reported that at approximately 11:30 PM on the 19th of this month, two gunshots were suddenly heard near the Hongkou District Police Station. Shortly after, Japanese army and navy soldiers appeared on the streets to conduct an investigation. Residents in the area were unaware of the true situation, leading to another disturbance. This was because several Japanese military officers had been ambushed in Hongkou recently. Rumors spread quickly among Chinese residents, one saying that another Japanese military officer had been assassinated on a certain street in Wusong Road. This was later proven to be inaccurate. The gunshots were actually fired by a drunk Japanese man, who was apprehended by public concession police officers and taken to the Hongkou Police Station, before being handed over to the Japanese Consulate Police Department.

### Soochow University Faculty and Students - Commemorate Zhu Hua - To Be Held Today at the Tzu Shu Building - Faculty, Staff and Students Mourn This Person Together

Ever since Zhu Hua (also known as Zhu Hua), a third-year student in the Architecture Department of Soochow University, was shot and killed by the police after advising his younger brother not to get involved in a gang fight, there has been a public outcry. As Zhu Hua was an outstanding student during his time at the university and got along well with teachers and friends, the faculty and students of Soochow University were deeply saddened and indignant upon hearing the news of his death. They collectively voiced their disapproval. For the sake of commemoration, the Architecture Society of the university, with the approval of the university authorities, initiated a memorial service, which will be held today at 4:15 PM at Room 320, 3rd Floor, Tzu Shu Building, Nanjing Road.

At that time, many of Zhu Hua's posthumous works, various architectural design drawings, will also be exhibited for mourning. His younger brother plans to personally attend the meeting to report on his brother's innocent death and other circumstances. The Architecture Society, which is responsible for preparing the memorial service, has sent invitations to relevant schools to send representatives to attend. Students of the university who wish to attend the memorial service are eager to participate. It is estimated that no less than one hundred people will attend at that time.

President to Attend

Moreover, the faculty and staff of Soochow University are extremely grieved by the student's unfortunate passing. When the memorial service is held this afternoon, President Li Pei'en, Acting President Ming Side, Dean Tan Dakai, Director of Student Affairs Zhuo Riren, and many other department heads and professors from the Architecture Department all intend to participate in person to mourn this person together and deliver speeches to express their condolences.

### Chinese Women's Temperance Association - Holds Charity Bazaar

It has scheduled a charity sale on the 23rd and 24th of this month at its premises. In addition to handicrafts made by the Xinsheng refugees, ladies from all walks of life and major companies and businesses who enthusiastically support the refugee production and relief cause will generously donate items to participate in the bazaar and support the charitable cause together. The time is from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Most of the items on display are daily necessities, and the prices are not expensive.

### Autumn Colors of the Flower Show (Part 2)

— Ai Nong

On the two tables next to it were the works of another Chinese member, Mr. Kong Zhiqing. Mr. Kong won the first prize certificate, and his works have their own value. There were more than twenty potted landscapes participating, mostly water and stone landscapes, large and small, varied and different. Each pot has its own poetic sentiment, and each pot has its own artistic conception, as if seeing many masterpieces of landscape paintings by famous painters in a national art exhibition. All kinds of bonsai plants are also trimmed properly, excelling purely in technique. The most meaningful bonsai is the "Dawn" with the Great Wall of China as the background. In this small pot, you can see that China's beautiful rivers and mountains are still intact, which unconsciously arouses patriotism. There were many business cards on his table, and I learned that Mr. Kong uses this as a profession, establishing a new banner in the Baile Commercial Market, and his works are often on display. In the future, there will often be opportunities to visit. He gave me a pot of fertilizer powder from the "Immortal" brand, which is said to be the latest invention, specially for potted plants. Once applied, it can make the flowers and trees in the pot very bright in two weeks. I will take it back and try it.

There are also works by other Westerners, which are divided into categories and concentrated on a long table. On the table are chrysanthemums, equipped with various vases and flower baskets, dazzling and too late to appreciate one by one. There are also works by students from Western schools, colorful and well-arranged.

In a large hall on the left, large chrysanthemums are displayed, all in neat and regular styles, catering to Western tastes. And most of the various fruits and vegetables are also eaten by Westerners. However, whether it is a vegetable or a radish, they are all fresh and large, making anyone's appetite stimulated.

It took a full two hours to appreciate this fleeting glance. That night, I had a good dream full of flowers, as if I were in a country of fragrance, truly feeling like an immortal. (End)

If you can't see a movie, you have to enjoy the advertisement; it's nothing more than drawing cakes to satisfy your hunger and quenching your thirst with plums. Who is the great dictator?

"It's Chaplin." Before we burst into laughter, we felt that in the moment before laughing, there was really restraint and content!

We won't worry about how this film will make us laugh. But Chaplin said, "Laughter is always beneficial to health." Further, his father said, "Laughter can also make those who behave improperly in the world know how to love themselves." Therefore, the purpose of his producing this film, according to himself, is very simple.

The one on the right is indeed an advertisement, a movie advertisement from the New York Times, just like the advertisements published in our newspaper every day. I don't know how many movie fans will be coaxed to see the masterpiece of the world's only comedian.

Chaplin is the epitome of laughter, just like when we see in advertisements: "Lipton Meanstea" - leave secret tons of "tea" too - in general. As soon as you see his big name, there is no one who will not laugh. Therefore, having Chaplin star in "The Great Dictator" is nothing more than taking a joke and making a joke. But the things in the world, the simpler they are, the more unbreakable they feel. Seeing the three words Chaplin has already made people laugh, why Chaplin represents "dictator"!

On Monday, the fifteenth of last month, "The Great Dictator" made its first public appearance in New York. The Astor and Capitol theaters simultaneously premiered it, at 8:45 PM. The protagonist Chaplin quietly traveled from Hollywood to New York on a "American Airlines flight" on Saturday and Sunday, got off at LaGuardia Airport, and stayed at a friend's house in New York. On the night of the premiere, he and the main supporting actors in the film, his wife, Ms. Pauline Goddard, and Jack Wakai, who played Napollini (pay attention to the two words "lini" in Napollini) in the play, attended the premiere ceremony together. They were greeted by movie fans as if they were crazy. When Chaplin made this film, he shot a total of 500,000 feet of film, selected and cut twelve large volumes, which can be shown for one hour and forty minutes.

What exactly is the plot of "The Great Dictator", which has been so long-awaited, that it took Chaplin two years and a huge capital of more than 1.2 million US dollars to make it? In fact, although Chaplin performs brainless, neurotic, or foolishly funny actions in various films, as well as all kinds of expressions that make people laugh and cry ("suffering in the stomach, smiling on the face"), he himself is a hard-working, practical, and tough - (these three words do not seem to be funny) a businessman with organizational ability. If you compare the Chaplin you see on the screen, who has already transformed, with the Chaplin in his original appearance, and think that he is two in one, then you will lose by thousands of miles if you are only slightly off. And how can this ancestor of comedy always sit on the throne of the country of laughter, as stable as Mount Tai, without any signs of disturbance?

We must know that Chaplin's humor is a laugh from the heart. This kind of laugh is not bound by time and space, and does not distinguish between men, women, old and young. All "people" will laugh, because laughter is what makes a person. Conversely, if you can laugh at Chaplin's funny actions, then this person will also cry. Chaplin uses the philosophy of crying to cause laughter to occur. The deeper the degree of sadness, injustice, pain, and oppression, the thicker the content of laughter he performs. The reason why the plot of "The Great Dictator" is so happy and funny is really because there are too many places hidden with sadness and pain!

The plot of "The Great Dictator" is very simple. You will laugh when you see it once, and you will find it even funnier when you see it again. If you see it three or four...five...times, there is nothing but laughter. It turns out that the final ending of the story is that the dictator himself is a spring dream. The little Jewish barber, in absolutely "unintentionally", adds unexpected facts to the totalitarian country under the dictator's rule - launching a revolution, it's really a joke!

When Jin Shengtan was about to be executed, he said, "Killing is a painful thing, but I got it 'unintentionally'!" The unintentionalness in Chaplin's play is comparable to what Jin Shengtan said. Comedy is always comedy, just like the crows in the world are always black.

The story of "The Great Dictator", to put it simply, should be described as follows:

A little Jew named Hengel lives in the country of Tomannia. During the First World War, he served as a soldier on the front line. Due to the shock of the artillery fire and the panic of the plane explosion, he became a person with complete memory loss, unable to speak clearly, and half-crazy with heart disease. At that time, a dictator in his country, named Adenoid Hynkel (also played by Chaplin, with the same name as the barber), gradually gained power and seized all power. Hengel was fortunate to suffer from "mental loss", so he did not feel pain for all the facilities of the dictator. After returning home from the army, he worked as a barber. Because he offended the dictator's stormtroopers, he was arrested by the government. At this time, the dictator's favorite adjutant, Stilz, had been helped by Hengel in the war, and finally repaid his kindness with virtue and did not arrest him.

### Police Translator Zhao Anda Steals Head Constable's Gun - Recovered by Search Team on Chengdu Road

Martin, the Western head constable of the Jiaxing Road Police Station, hung his official handgun with its leather case in the police station office on the evening of the 18th of this month. Unexpectedly, the gun suddenly disappeared the next morning. At that time, the police station authorities believed that since outsiders could not freely enter and exit the office, it must have been done by someone in the police station. They arrested Wan Ruqin from Anhui and Fu Jiaxi from Nanjing, two coolies, on suspicion and sent them to the Special Court for interrogation and detention. It is now learned that the actual criminal in this case has been apprehended by the police station, and the handgun and six bullets have also been recovered. The criminal's name is Zhao Anda, only nineteen years old, registered in Nanjing, and works as a translator at the Jiaxing Road Police Station (his father is a police detective). He lives at No. 3, Lane 103, Guling Road. After stealing the gun and bullets, he planned to sell them. At 9:30 PM the night before, he took the gun to hand it over, but because the price was not right, he brought it back to his residence. Unexpectedly, while passing near No. 741, Chengdu Road, he was found by a police station search team and taken to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Fourth Criminal Division of the Special Court. Police station lawyer Peng Qiqi stated the case, saying that the two police station clerks, Zhao and Fu, who were previously arrested had no relationship to this case and requested that their detention be revoked. However, Fu Jiaxi had another incident of stealing a police officer's whistle award, which must be prosecuted separately. When Zhao Anda was questioned, he confessed to the charges. The court ruled that Zhao Yuqin would be released first, and Zhao Anda would be detained until the 27th to be tried together with Fu Jiaxi.

### Yesterday Morning's Constable Confrontation with Robbers on Route Ghisi - One Robber Dies from Serious Injuries - One Constable Injured in the Leg

At 7:45 AM yesterday morning, three robbers suddenly broke into the home of a Zhang family, a Ningbo cotton cloth merchant, at No. 10, Zhilan Lane, Route Ghisi, French Concession. Two of the robbers had handguns. They entered through the back door and robbed 2,000 yuan in cash and two gold rings before fleeing. At that time, a certain Mr. A, a tenant of the Zhang family, secretly followed behind. Seeing the three robbers fleeing eastward, he reported to Chinese Constable No. 154 at the intersection of Route Wagner and Rue Marcel. The constable then blew his whistle and chased after them. The two robbers knew that things were not going well, so they fled towards Rue Min Teni Yin and the Great World. At that time, Chinese Constable No. 283, a three-wheeled police officer from the French Police Station, was patrolling the area. Upon hearing the alarm, he got off his motorcycle and chased after the robbers. At that time, the traffic light in the middle of Avenue Edward VII was green, opening up north-south traffic, so the robbers were able to cross Avenue Edward VII. In an instant, two robbers disappeared. Only one robber, wearing a gray striped suit and with a short stature, fled eastward and turned around to shoot at the constable to resist arrest. The constables also returned fire, and a series of gunshots were fired, totaling more than ten shots. Pedestrians fled in panic. The robber then fled into the hot spring bathhouse at the corner of Avenue Edward VII and Yunnan Road. Chinese Constable No. 553 from the Public Concession, who was also there, also fired his gun to block his path. As a result, the robber was attacked from both sides and was shot three times in the chest, abdomen, and feet. Due to the critical injuries, he immediately fell to the ground and died. Chinese Constable No. 553 was also shot in the right foot by the robber's bullet. At that time, both the French and Public Concession police stations had received the news and sent police cars and detectives to the scene. The injured constable was sent to the police hospital, and the dead robber was sent to Renji Hospital. The Public Concession Police Station then transferred the dead robber and a six-inch Browning handgun seized from the dead robber to the French Police Station for handling.

### Extorting a Flour Shop Owner - Two Criminals Arrested

The Ruiji Flour Shop at No. 122 North Zhejiang Road was founded by Pan Ruijie, a native of Luodian. Between the 7th and 14th of this month, he suddenly received three threatening letters from a gang and a basket of apples containing a hand grenade. The second letter contained two bullets, demanding 50,000 yuan and urging payment by phone up to six times. Pan was disturbed by these people and secretly reported to the police. At about 4:00 PM on the 21st, Hua Detective Shang Wu and Detective Li Dacheng, who were handling the case, arrested Gu Xiaodi, a native of Pudong, and Yu Yutang, a native of Ningbo, near Yuyuan Road, Jing'an Temple Road, while they were telephoning the victim to go to a certain place to negotiate the payment. A piece of paper with the words "Received 1,300 yuan" was found on Gu's body. Both were taken to the Huisi Police Station for detention and escorted to the First Special Court yesterday morning. Police Station lawyer Zhang Tianyin explained the case and requested a postponement. Judge Huang Risheng questioned the two defendants and ordered them to be remanded in custody and rescheduled for further verification.

### Mahjong Shop Employee - Punished for Private Business

Miao Jinbao, a native of Anhui, was an employee of the Zhang Rongxing Mahjong Shop at No. 710 Guangdong Road. He was dismissed on September 1 of this year. On October 5, a customer surnamed Jie came to the shop to urge the delivery of a confirmed order, saying that he had paid a deposit of more than 1,500 yuan on August 28 and September 9, respectively, and had receipts, etc. The shop then discovered that the receipts were stamped with the shop's seal by Miao Jinbao while he was in office. He had secretly received the payments, continuously embezzled them, and failed to report them to the accounts, intending to engage in private business. The shop entrusted lawyer Huang Renda of Yide Heng Law Firm to file a complaint with the First Special Court, accusing Miao of stealing the seal and breach of trust, and requesting investigation and prosecution. The case was heard by the judge the other day. Defendant Miao Jinbao initially tried to deny it, but after witness Jie was summoned to court to testify, Miao finally admitted that he was engaging in private business. Judge Xiao then concluded the trial and sentenced Miao Jinbao to a fine of 120 yuan for breach of trust. If he could not pay, he would be sentenced to labor service, with two yuan equivalent to one day.

### Suspicious Man - Handgun and Bullets Seized

At 2:15 PM yesterday afternoon, officers from the Public Concession Police Department were inspecting pedestrians on Guangdong Road, Henan Road, when they saw a man passing by the entrance of Yongning Lane. He looked quite panicked. They immediately ordered him to stop and seized a handgun and five bullets from his body. He was taken to the police station for interrogation.

### Maid Abused - Fine Imposed

Li Shenshi, a native of Ningbo who previously worked as a hostess, lives at No. 407 Siwen Lane, Datong Road. In May, she spent 26 yuan to buy a nine-year-old girl, Xu Ayu, as her adopted daughter. However, she was quite violent by nature and made Xu work all day long. Whenever she was slightly dissatisfied, she would often beat her, causing her head and buttocks to be severely injured. Xia Li, the wife of the second landlord, witnessed this and could not bear it, so she reported it to the Xinzha Police Station. Detective Yuan Yao was dispatched to arrest Li Shenshi and bring her to the police station. Yesterday morning, she was escorted to the First Special Court. Police Station lawyer Li Zhishan filed a lawsuit according to law. After questioning by the judge, Li Shenshi was sentenced to a fine of 60 yuan, and the girl was sent to the Jiliang Institute for food and lodging.

### Incense Industry Labor-Management Dispute - Settlement Terms Agreed

### Ministry of Finance Issues Order Strictly Prohibiting - High-Interest Loans in Rural Areas

In view of the fact that usury has long been strictly prohibited, the Ministry of Finance has learned that there are now those who are taking advantage of the war to create ingenious names and exploit farmers again. In some cases, the interest within one year even exceeds the principal, and in others, the interest reaches more than 10%. Farmers are in urgent need of funds to purchase fertilizers and seeds, and are forced to drink poison to quench their thirst. There are also local bullies colluding with uncooperative Baojia chiefs, requiring that all borrowers must be introduced and certified by the Baojia chief, and the Baojia chief must take a commission from the borrowed funds as an introduction and certification fee. This kind of high-interest loan is illegal. In addition to consulting with the provincial governments to investigate and ban it, the Ministry of Finance also ordered the Central Trust of China, the Bank of Communications, the Agricultural Bank of China, and the Provincial Banks in the four provinces to expand agricultural loans as much as possible in accordance with the outline of agricultural loans, so as to protect the development of the rural economy. Debtors are allowed to accuse and punish unqualified Baojia chiefs who collude in exploitation or illegal detention according to law.

### Letter to the Editor

Dear Editor,
I recently read in the newspaper about a shooting at the Dasanxing Restaurant on Fuzhou Road during a wedding of someone surnamed Lu, stating that the Lu was the owner of Wanli Rice Company. We have checked and there is no such person in our company, nor any shareholder surnamed Lu. We fear this is misinformation. We are sending this letter in order to correct this news. Respectfully, to the Editor of Shen Bao. Wanli Rice Company

### The Success and Failure of Banquets

In social circles, holding banquets is a very common occurrence, whether at home or in restaurants. Indeed, banquets can allow us to make many friends and conduct social business.

Before holding a banquet, there are many things to do. First, we must decide on the location of the banquet. If our home is furnished quite cleanly, then we can hold it at home, which is not only cheaper, but also allows guests to have more fun. Otherwise, we can hold it in a restaurant.

Second, we must decide on the list of invitees and send out invitations within a few days. At the same time, we must also decide whether it will be a tea party, a luncheon, or a dinner party.

On the day of the banquet, it is best to notify each invitee so that they can all arrive. Then, various arrangements such as the dining table, furnishings, and the guests' entertainment problems must also be prepared.

If we are hosting, we must make every guest feel well taken care of, which requires sufficient and lively spirit.

During the meal, fluent and lively conversation can often make the banquet very colorful. We must be clear and careful, which requires a lot of energy.

After eating, we must provide each guest with a considerable amount of time, a table, or, or appreciate a few interesting books, start, or play.

In short, the success or failure of a banquet depends on the host's attentive hospitality and the guests' attitude.

If we suffer from headaches, toothaches, rheumatism, or menstrual pain, we cannot make the banquet a success.

### In My Position

— Zhi Yu

It seems that God is deliberately making things difficult for us. Today, we encountered the promotional work of the safety movement, but it unceremoniously started to drizzle.

It was half past seven, and I hurried to the school without an umbrella to collect the "Safety First" armband. I ran into the school office, but it was deserted, with not a single person there. Indeed, it was too early, not even eight o'clock yet! After a few minutes, students came in twos and threes. The office clock also chimed eight times, but the office staff had not yet arrived.

"It's eight o'clock, and it's time for us to go on duty. Why haven't the armbands been distributed yet!" a student asked impatiently.

"Mr. × is still asleep. How can he distribute them?" another student replied.

"Wait a minute! Don't grumble. Be careful when he comes," the class leader kindly advised.

After about ten minutes of such discussion, Mr. × came swaggering in, with a cigar in his mouth and a roll of red armbands in his hand. He also mumbled, "It doesn't matter. There won't be too many people in the morning. It doesn't matter if it's a few minutes late." Although, he clearly knew that he was not keeping to time.

Because it was already past the time to go on duty, we had to rush to our posts. The work began in this way.

Our post—Aiguo Road—was quite lively. At first, those sacred laborers came and went, including salt sellers carrying bags and vegetable girls carrying burdens. When they saw us, they thought we were "special patrolmen" and were afraid that we would take them to the "union." So, they ran away as if they were flying before we could open our mouths. They were extremely afraid of being "caught" by the patrolmen.

More and more pedestrians came. I handed out leaflets to them one by one.

Some people thought we were selling "elixirs." When they saw us approaching, they immediately said "no" and left. When we explained to them, they gave us a "white eye." Among them, most were neatly dressed "gentlemen."

When we handed out leaflets to fashionable ladies or young women, they often arrogantly ignored us and continued their "wonderful" pace. Perhaps they were unwilling to stretch out their jade hands from their coat pockets to accept this "worthless" piece of paper!

After running into forty or fifty "unlucky" encounters in a row, I was really angry. I stood there blankly, letting the rain wash away the gloom in my heart! Suddenly, a hand as black as lacquer stretched out in front of my eyes. I was startled by it, and when I raised my head to look, it turned out to be a worker of about twenty years old wearing dirty blue overalls, his face as black as the "Darkie Toothpaste" trademark, carrying quite heavy iron blocks on his back, asking me for a leaflet.

"Sir, excuse me, give me one."

"Walk...ing...must...be...sure...to...on the road...", I gave him one, and he stopped and read it word by word in a low voice.

"Are you not very literate?" I heard him read the word "along" as "lead," so I asked.

"Yes, I have never been to school, alas..."

"I'll read it to you," I volunteered to read all the words on the leaflet to him.

"Thank you, you are really...great, you are all young masters, and you are still serving the community on such a rainy day. It's a pity that I'm illiterate and can't...Hey! I should go. Can I take this paper to show my friends?" he said a lot in such a discontinuous manner with gratitude.

I was stunned again. It was not until Kun Jun called me that I realized this loyal friend had left.

Although it was only five or six minutes of conversation, I had already received great comfort from this friend. I knew that every word he said came from his pure heart. I was moved by him! The fire of just now had long subsided.

The time had come, and I reluctantly left the post—because it had given me great comfort there—and returned home in the drizzle.

Chapter Eleven Zhao Boxiong's Confession

I took the opportunity to express my opinion. "This old man looks very much like a moralist on the surface. I didn't expect him to use such a vicious method."

Hawthorn opened his eyes and looked at me, saying with emotion, "This is undoubtedly the magic of money that tempted him. However, he is just a hypocrite. His cultivation must not be sufficient. Otherwise, Mencius said, 'Wealth and rank cannot corrupt him.' These petty trinkets, rings, and earrings certainly cannot bewitch his mind. When I talked to him, I was also deceived by his mask, believing that he was an old-fashioned gentleman. Therefore, I even believed that the fake ivory cigarette holder he accidentally left on the desk when he committed the crime was something he left behind while reading the newspaper after dinner. Bao Lang, this is my mistake. I was deceived by him. In fact, from the cigarette holder, I measured his personality. Apart from the fact that smoking the cigarette to the end showed that he was excessively frugal, the intact preservation of the cigarette holder also showed that he was a careful and cautious person. However, when he deliberately forgot the cigarette holder when he walked out of the guest room at the end of the conversation, it also showed that he was a careless and forgetful person. This action was clearly completely contrary to my previous inference. I didn't even think of it immediately at the time, which shows that the sharpness of my mind is indeed gradually declining with age!" He sighed along with it.

I said, "It's no wonder you. His art of disguise is indeed very clever. As Jinmei said, he was the first to advocate reporting to the police station after the incident. He also seemed to indicate that Wang Lilan's life was somewhat self-inflicted. He seemed to be at a loss about her death, and he did not try to exculpate himself by pointing out other suspects. In short, his actions, attitude, and words were indeed not easy to make people suspicious."

Hawthorn shook his head and said, "No, in the conversation, he seemed to be very pure and dissatisfied with Lilan's behavior. In fact, after thinking about it carefully later, his purity also came from hypocrisy. You think, he came once in the autumn of the year before last. Since he was dissatisfied with Lilan's life and actions and believed that Shanghai was a dirty city, then why did he come again? And why did he still live in the house of his niece whom he was dissatisfied with?"

I nodded. "Then, what assumptions have you made about his actual assassination actions?"

Hawthorn said, "His steps of action, I think you can hear him say it himself in a while. There is no need for me to explain it indirectly, because I will be somewhat detached when I speak. However, the reason why my attention was focused on him and then determined that it was him, the key lies in that A print. I remembered that I had seen a pair of slippers left by Lu Jiansheng in the guest room, so I thought that perhaps there was also a pair of leather shoes left in the house for Li Zhifan to use. Just now, when I went to the police station alone, I asked you to go to Lilan's house to talk to Li Zhifan first. My purpose was to ask you to find a way to detain him downstairs so that I could quietly go to his room to search for Lu Jiansheng's pair of black leather shoes. Later, you also saw that I did find the pair of leather shoes in Lilan's room. You also told me about Li Shouqi's attempted rape, and my idea was completely confirmed. (174)

### The Great Me

— Zhu Xun

Like a stove in the field, I am a tiny seedling among countless wheat crops, but I must also grow well, sprout and thrive, carrying a full body of grains. Each grain contains sufficient nutrients.

Like a forest, I am a small tree in a long forest of ten thousand fruits, but I must also grow firmly, unafraid of wind and rain, fearless of cold and frost, with lush branches and leaves, creating a strong and beautiful quality, giving people a good shade for rest.

Like a flood sea, I am a drop in the middle of the great ocean. Although it is a very small drop, I also know the rise and fall of all the waves and the coming and going of the tides. I should also show the strength of my share everywhere to show the life of the world, the avenging and angry tide is rushing!

Like an ant, I am one of the small animal ant colony, but for freedom, for liberation, I want to climb over the Great Wall for thousands of miles, climb to the top of Changbai Mountain, to cut off the iron shackles of the slaves, and step on the path of blood to protect the rivers and mountains of the motherland!

### Film Queen — Bette Davis

— Qinghui

Bette Davis, who was elected as this year's film queen in Hollywood, is not an actor, a star, but a talented female artist. She exchanged her superb acting skills for this noble honor. No matter what kind of role she plays, she can perform it vividly and incisively. Moreover, she is as beautiful as a fish or a wild goose, and as shy as a flower behind the moon. When she smiles, she is like a hibiscus in the wind; when she cries, she is like a begonia in the rain. It is most appropriate to describe her with flowers. Let's stop the small talk and get back to the topic:

Work-Study

On April 5, 1908, her mother traveled to Lowell, and because of overwork, she gave birth to a girl who was less than ten months old. She was Bette. Not long after she was born, her parents announced their divorce, and Bette lived with her mother. Poor her, she was often sick in her childhood and spent her happy girlhood in misery. Later, because of the poverty of the family, she had to serve in the school to provide for her tuition. She studied day and night, and in this way, she completed her studies.

Won Awards Twice

Of course, she does not regard hard work as an exception, but she hopes to seek a way out on Broadway or Hollywood. Finally, after a year of hard work, she was arranged to play a supporting role in a film, but the result was a failure. This film almost closed her out of the film industry. However, she had great confidence. Finally, she played the main role in the film "Dangerous", and won the Academy Award in one fell swoop. In 1938, she won the award again for "Jezebel". The current public screening in Shanghai of "The Great Lie" is another success of hers. It seems that she, this film queen, is most likely to win this year's Academy Award.

Loves Poetry

In her private life, Bette has a very strong love for poetry. She not only likes to read, but also often picks up a pen to write. She not only writes, but also often publishes in magazines. "Arnoux Mace" is her pseudonym. Romance is the demeanor of a poet, but this female poet, on the contrary, she works very seriously, even more seriously than ordinary female workers. She arrives at the company at 8:00 in the morning and does not return home until 8:00 in the evening. Who can stay in the workplace for so long like her? Therefore, many people wonder why she has to work so hard. Sometimes she herself is surprised, but the habit remains unchanged. The least happy thing in her life is having nothing to do, a period of just looking for joy all day long.

Admires China

You may be surprised. Bette Davis is a female star who admires China. She once said this: "Since I was a child, I knew that there was such a powerful and invincible China in the Far East. It contains countless mineral raw materials, towering high mountains, and winding rivers. However, the people there do not rely on high mountains and deep rivers as natural barriers, and fertile lands as a source of life. They rely on the outstanding spirit of perseverance and endurance and are now fighting against the invaders in self-defense in order to seek permanent glorious peace. From this we can know how great and bright China is."

### Good News for Zhang Junqiu and Mao Shilai

— Magpie

Married one after another — ten days apart

In the capital's opera world, there have been two major events recently, that is, two of the four little famous dan — Zhang Junqiu and Mao Shilai, are both getting married! Zhang Junqiu is marrying Zhao Yankui's daughter, and the wedding is scheduled for today (the 23rd) at Fushoutang. Junqiu was recently invited by Tianjin China Grand Theater to perform, and only rushed back to Beiping five days before the wedding. Mao Shilai's fiancée is Liu Binsheng's adopted sister, also surnamed Liu, and the wedding is scheduled for December 3, at Cuihualou. After Zhang Junqiu returned to Ping from Tianjin, Mao Shilai went to Tianjin after Zhang Junqiu, also at the invitation of China Grand Theater, and also decided to rush back to Beiping five days before the wedding. This is already a coincidence, and the wedding locations of the two families: Fushoutang and Cuihualou, are also both in the East City, only dozens of steps apart. This is another coincidence. In addition, the wedding ceremonies of both families are using old-fashioned flag umbrellas and canopies, and the sedan chairs are contracted by Hengtai Wedding Sedan Shop. This is even more of a coincidence. (Posted from Beiping on November 18)

### Yan Qiu and Zhen Fei

— Meng Yu

Since Xue Yanqin and others left, Xin Yanqiu has become the leader of female performers, and many latecomers cannot match her. Xinling's learning process has a great resemblance to her. My late friend Bu Linyu had great expectations and once sent a poem to Xinling saying: "Although my darling is growing day by day, I always mention you in my mouth." Xinling is also Linyu's adopted daughter. This time in Shanghai, there will not be many performances. I also happened to be in another city, and after returning, I only got to watch her play Wang Baochuan. I could not enjoy her wonderful performance, but one glimpse is enough to get a general idea of the rest. Moreover, Xinling is graceful and has the demeanor of a great family. Her portrayal of Wang Baochuan makes her strengths even more evident. The cloth skirt and hairpin are purely natural, without any traces of artificiality. I cannot help but sigh at the perfection. This time, the most outstanding supporting actor is Yu Zhenfei. Zhenfei is also an old friend. More than ten years ago, Zhenfei often came to my residence on holidays. At that time, he was still a famous amateur with a heroic spirit, unparalleled for a time. This reminds me of my late friend and famous qin player Lu Jun. Zhenfei took care of me, and Lu often came with him. The other famous amateurs were also friendly with Lu. Every time they sang, it was even more wonderful with Lu playing the qin. Now the grass on the grave has grown, and looking back on the past, I am sad and shed tears. I believe Zhenfei must also have the same feeling!
