### The Chinese Army in Southern Guangxi Repeatedly Defeats the Japanese Offensive; The Japanese Army's Large-Scale Offensive Towards the Yonglong Road is Repelled; The Chinese Army in the Jin City and Gaoping Area Advances Rapidly

Liuzhou: The Guangxi Army has recently repeatedly defeated the Japanese offensive. A few days ago, the Japanese army launched a large-scale offensive towards Luotian on the Yonglong Road but was ambushed by the mobile Chinese army. By the 27th, they were unable to withstand and fled. (2nd Telegram)

Liuzhou: At dawn on the 29th, the Japanese army, advancing along the Yonglong Road towards Longnong Village, used four cannons and four tanks to cover their infantry in a fierce attack on the Chinese army. The Chinese army met them head-on with a heavy blow, and a fierce battle unfolded. From morning to noon, the sounds of artillery and machine guns shook the sky. The Japanese launched repeated assaults but ultimately failed. The two sides are still engaged in a bloody battle. (2nd Telegram)

Luoyang: More than a thousand Japanese troops with more than ten cannons stationed in the Ba Gongzhen and Gaodu area northeast of Jin City, simultaneously attacked the Fengtou Village south along the Jincheng-Lingchuan Avenue on the morning of the 27th. The Chinese army engaged them in separate counterattacks, resulting in fierce fighting. Another unit of the Chinese army happened to advance to the area between Gaoping and Jin City at this time, taking advantage of the enemy's weakness to launch a surprise attack from the rear. The advance was very rapid, and the encirclement was gradually tightening. (2nd Telegram)

### Jiang Tingfu Issues a Statement After Returning to Chongqing

Chongqing: Jiang Tingfu, Director of the Political Affairs Department of the Executive Yuan, recently led a political inspection group of five people to inspect the six provinces of Hunan, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Guangdong, and Guangxi. Having returned here, he recently issued a statement to the press, elaborating on his impressions of the trip. He said that he had contacted people from all walks of life in the six provinces and had informal conversations to understand the economic situation of the six southeastern provinces, which was very good. The prosperity of the rural areas in our interior allows trained and experienced talents to have development opportunities. For example, the slaughter tax collected by various provinces has increased sharply, indicating that farmers have sold agricultural products at high prices, resulting in higher incomes. The consumption of pork has also increased, which also reflects the prosperity of the interior. Secondly, the land tax revenue of various provinces has also increased. Although the land tax itself has not increased, because most farmers are wealthy, they can afford to pay off accumulated taxes. In addition, there is ample cash everywhere, and it is very common for debtors to redeem their mortgages. Furthermore, there is another phenomenon that is quite noteworthy: old-fashioned textile machines that have been idle for a long time have recently been put into use again. This is because the source of fabrics from outside has become less and less, and the trend of people in various places weaving and spinning their own cloth is becoming more common. This measure not only solves the problem of people's clothing but also prevents capital from flowing out. In addition, ordinary merchants have great foresight and have stockpiled a large amount of gasoline, various metal machines, and other commodities many years ago, which is also of great benefit to the country's welfare during the war of resistance. However, on the other hand, the greatest difficulty in the six southeastern provinces lies in the lack of technical talent. Even in terms of workers, there is a great shortage of workers due to the implementation of the compulsory military service system and the recruitment of workers to build roads or to serve in transportation. There are also not enough trained intellectuals to go to the interior to guide emerging businesses. Therefore, there are now a large number of important positions that require experienced talent. The county magistrates told me that the prosperity in the interior is unprecedented in the past twenty years. As for the finances of the various provinces, they are very sound. Tax revenues have increased significantly. In addition, the various economic and trade undertakings run by the provincial authorities have generated huge profits. Even land that was previously considered uncultivable is now being cultivated. In short, there is no shortage of food. The only problem is transportation. (1st Havas Telegram)

Chongqing: The National Government issued a decree on the 2nd, stating that Zhou Junyan, Director of the Quartermaster General Supervision Department of the Ministry of Military Affairs, was loyal and honest, and upheld integrity. He participated in the revolution in Guangdong, assisted the military, and transported supplies to aid the Northern Expedition five years ago. He made significant contributions. In recent years, he has served in the central government, presided over the affairs of the Military Affairs Department, planned meticulously, and left no stone unturned. He worked diligently from morning to night, and his loyalty and trustworthiness were widely recognized by officers and soldiers. During the three years of the War of Resistance, he provided supplies without delay, which greatly benefited the military. It was expected that he would contribute his wisdom and talents for a long time, but the news of his death from illness was sudden and deeply mourned.

### The National Government Reissues an Order to Rectify Official Conduct

Chongqing: The National Government issued an order on the 1st, stating that selecting virtuous and capable people is an essential task for the country. It is imperative to ensure that everyone is competent in their position, so that governance can be prosperous and enlightened. A clear order was issued in 1928 stating that senior officials should not recommend individuals to lower or parallel agencies in their personal capacity, in order to eliminate the malpractice of favoritism and prevent the pursuit of solicitation. The intention was far-reaching and does not need further explanation. Now, in this extraordinary period of the War of Resistance and national reconstruction, the responsibilities are extremely heavy, and it is even more necessary to promote true talent and prevent opportunism. However, the previous order has been in effect for a long time, and it is feared that there may be outward compliance but inward defiance. It is essential to reiterate the warning. All internal and external officials must strictly abide by it. In addition to recommending and employing subordinates in accordance with the law based on their authority, they must strictly avoid relying on personal relationships to solicit other lower or parallel agencies in order to eliminate redundancy and purify the officialdom. Those who are responsible for supervising personnel and administration should also pay close attention to this matter, correct any deviations in a timely manner, and set an example for colleagues. They should uphold the ideals of impartiality and loyalty and jointly establish good rules for selection. Great expectations are placed on them. This order (1st Telegram)

The gathering ended at 11:00 pm. (1st Telegram)

### The British Ship "Foshan" is Detained in Guangzhou

Guangzhou: The British ship "Foshan," which sails from Guangzhou to Hong Kong every Thursday, was unable to sail out yesterday morning after all the passengers had boarded because the manager of the ship, Taikoo Company, disagreed with the Japanese pilot. According to Dinstel, manager of Taikoo Company, the ship could not sail because there was no pilot. Although Taikoo Company was unwilling to explain the reason for the lack of a pilot, it was learned from reliable sources that this was due to disagreement over pilotage fees. The "Foshan" is now indefinitely detained here, pending the outcome of ongoing negotiations. (2nd Reuters Telegram)

### The Sichuan Opium Inspection Team Prepares to Depart

Chengdu: Jiang, the concurrent head of the Sichuan Opium Inspection Team, specially appointed Chu Fucheng, director of the Wanzhou Office of the Sichuan-Kang Construction Promotion Association, to come to the province to act as the head of the team in his place, in order to show seriousness, as the team's organization is ready and will depart soon. The Opium Suppression Supervision Office has urgently telegraphed Chu to come quickly. The team is divided into (16) groups, and the group leaders are appointed by the central government and various relevant agencies, the Sichuan provincial party and government, the military, and members of the Senate. If local officials are found to have violated laws or neglected their duties, the provincial government may be telegraphed to immediately remove and punish them. If an opium offender is truly unforgivable, the team leader may telegraph the case to Chairman Chiang for approval and execute them on the spot in order to show a stern warning and demonstrate the government's determination to eradicate opium.

Editorial

### The Problem of General Social Health

There are no accurate statistics on the mortality rate of Shanghai residents. What we see and hear is that there are dozens of deaths on the streets every day, and beggars suffering from illness are everywhere. There are countless people from poor families groaning in bed, dying without access to medicine, and in general, dying from quack doctors and fake medicines. Therefore, when we read the news from yesterday's newspaper about the thirtieth birthday of the "Iron Lung Man," can we not sigh? The American Mr. Snyder is known as the "Iron Lung Man." He traveled to China in March 1936 and suddenly contracted paralysis in Beiping. His breathing was near cessation, so he was kept in an iron lung and could not leave it for a moment. Yesterday's report said that this man was able to leave his iron lung and celebrate his thirtieth birthday, and his wife will give birth next month. To entrust one's life to an iron lung, with life and death hanging on breathing, and yet not die; not only not die, but gradually recover one's original functions and be able to bear children, is truly a miracle of medical progress.

Although medicine today is indeed advanced, its progress is revealed differently depending on the person. Without Mr. Snyder's wealth, one would be paralyzed and die tragically, with a tomb long built. Even if one is fortunate enough to live with the disease, the suffering one endures is no less than a living hell. Mr. Snyder not only returned to the United States from China, but also went to France from the United States, enjoying life freely. In New York, he visited the World's Fair, and in Germany, he watched tennis matches with a reflective mirror installed in his iron lung. Although his body was paralyzed, the medical treatment was certainly unimpeded, and his mind was at ease, so even a fatal illness could be overcome. If one cannot get the right doctor or medicine, or gets the doctor but not the medicine, or gets the medicine but not the doctor, or even has no medicine or doctor, then even a curable illness can lead to death. Therefore, whether a person lives or dies is not only determined by nature but also depends on human efforts to help.

Looking back at the patients in Shanghai society today, how can they be compared? They do not expect to have even a fraction of Mr. Snyder's treatment and care, but they struggle in their sickbeds and wander on the path of life and death. There are countless people who cannot get good doctors and medicine and eventually die; some are harmed by quack doctors and fake medicines and die; and some seek medical treatment and medicine but cannot find it and hasten their death. These people do not die from disease but from lack of money, doctors, and medicine. People who die from lack of money, doctors, and medicine can be said to have died an unnatural death or to be a symptom of a sick society.

Today, the only saviors for the poor and sick are the free clinics run by various charities. Speaking of free clinics, only six or seven have somewhat decent facilities. Among them, Renji Charity provides treatment to about seven or eight hundred people every day, charging a registration fee of two dimes and providing a dose of medicine. It is indeed providing great benefits to the poor and sick. This is a large number within the scope of one charity's free clinic, but compared to the vast sea of people suffering from illness, it is probably very small. From this, we can see that even the benefits of these free clinics are not universally available. Moreover, most free clinics run by charities are limited to traditional Chinese medicine, and Western medicine is rare. Therefore, those who seek Western medical treatment must go to hospitals with a more public nature, but they are crowded, rushed, and indifferent. If patients want an accurate diagnosis, they have to seek private doctors. Private doctors who claim to offer free treatment to the poor are as rare as morning stars, and even when they exist, there are many things that are not "free." Therefore, after seeking treatment once or twice, they have no ability to seek further medical care. They can only rely on their own strength to fight the disease. If they are lucky and win, they live; if they are unlucky and lose, they die. Such tragedies are commonly seen and heard by ordinary people, and they have no time to sigh.

Who is to blame for this, and it is indeed very difficult to remedy. We cannot say much about construction, but we can only hope to improve the situation. We know that for every undertaking to be successful, both talent and wealth are indispensable. If there is wealth but no talent, it is simply a waste and does not benefit the undertaking. If there is talent but no wealth, then one toils diligently but achieves little. Therefore, to solve the suffering of the poor and sick, first, we must still hope that the public will share compassion, with those who have the ability helping those who do not, and those who have money helping those who do not. Second, providing medical treatment and medicine is a noble cause. Do not be greedy for fame, but there should be reality. Medical treatment should be precise and thorough, and medicines should be genuine and authentic. To do a superficial job and use fake medicines is not to save people but to kill them. It is seeking life but getting death, and doing good turns into evil. Third, if you are willing to serve the poor and sick, you should be without complaint or anger, and be sincere and respectful. You should know that most patients are frustrated. A little sympathy will bring great comfort. To be rude will be a great stimulus. We must hope that doctors and nurses will show compassion.

However, this is only for the poor and sick. For salaried workers, in addition to the medical and pharmaceutical benefits provided by the organizations they serve, which are their rights as employees, they have permanent jobs and should not rely on charity. They should only take good care of themselves. However, salaries are limited, and serious illnesses are a cause for concern. Even if savings are not small, prolonged illness is also a cause for concern. To bear the heavy burden of a family with one person's strength, to face unexpected illness with a fixed income, the salaried class, even if they take great care of themselves, often cannot protect themselves completely. Then, what is to be done? To rely on individual efforts is bound to be insufficient. To pray to Buddha in an emergency will have no effect. The key is to use collective power to create a well-organized organization. You must first share the burden of medical facilities when you are healthy, and then you will not have to worry about treatment costs when you are sick. This is effective self-help, lasting cooperation, and a rational and cost-effective method. There is no better plan. Gathering many people makes the task easier. This is the main point. With this collective strength, hire doctors who are knowledgeable, enthusiastic, and ethical to create a "health association" with comprehensive planning. Health associations are modern social organizations and are by no means a way for city doctors to attract long-term customers, make money, and seek profit.

### Japan's Closeness to the Axis Powers Deepens the Rift with the United States; There is a Trend to Re-Fortify Guam; The United States Halts the Shipment of 350,000 Barrels of Gasoline to Japan

Washington: According to unofficial and political circles last night, the basic policies of the new Japanese cabinet announced in Tokyo yesterday are likely to increase the existing rift between the United States and Japan. Secretary of State Hull and his subordinates refused to comment, but most people in Washington believe that there is nothing particularly new in this statement regarding Japanese policy. Many believe that there has been a gradual change in Japan's recent domestic and foreign policies. Japan is now seen as having acknowledged the abandonment of a nominal parliamentary system in favor of an all-powerful political system. It is believed that Japan is now focusing on the "Greater East Asia" plan, including the South Sea Islands. These trends indicate that Japan will eliminate its friendship with democratic countries and move closer to the Axis powers. It is unclear whether US-Japan relations will immediately deteriorate as a result, and depends on how Japan implements its announced plans. Various countries here yesterday warmly welcomed the publication of Japan's statement, although there were no community reviews on the matter for the time being, but the titles used by various newspapers implied their reaction. The Times Herald published the statement on the front page with the headline "Japanese Declare Asia Belongs to Us" "Japan Warns the United States of 'Non-Friendly' Embargoes" The Washington Star added a huge headline across the entire page above the message, calling "Japan Actively Governs the Entire Asia," Daily News headline calls "Japan Announces Far East Rule Plans," (2nd United Press Telegram)

Washington: California Democratic Congressman Isaac told a United Press reporter last night that Japan's recent announcement of its foreign policy may stimulate the United States Congress to support the proposal to fortify Guam. Isaac is a staff member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and believes that Japan's renewed announcement of its domestic and foreign policies in Tokyo will make the US Congress and the people feel that "the policy of appeasement toward Japan is useless." He said that Congress should take a tougher stance toward Japan in the future, and Congress is likely to strengthen Guam's defenses this autumn or early next year. Isaac also said, "Whenever there are events in Europe, Japan begins to act in the East. Japan believes that once Britain fails, we will be forced to withdraw from the Pacific. However, I do not believe that we have this intention, at least for now." Republican Congressman Fish said that he believes that the Roosevelt administration's intervention in the Far East is the reason for forcing Japan to change its current policies. He said, "I have long believed that if the government continues to take an anti-Japanese stance everywhere, the result will be to drive Japan closer to Germany and Italy or even closer to the Soviet Union. The situation in the Far East today is very regrettable, but we should bear a part of the responsibility ourselves." (2nd United Press Telegram)

Washington: It was calculated here yesterday that President Roosevelt's ban on the export of aviation gasoline has stopped the shipment of 350,000 barrels of gasoline from various parts of the United States to Japan. (2nd United Press Telegram)

### Japanese Foreign Minister Elaborates on New Cabinet's Foreign Policy: Abandoning the "Appeasing All Sides" Policy, Preparing to Adopt an Offensive Diplomacy

Hong Kong, Tokyo Dispatch: Due to the abstract nature of Matsuoka's statements, which were difficult to understand, he held a press conference on the afternoon of the 1st to explain further. His main points were that Japan will adopt an offensive diplomacy, abandoning its "appeasing all sides" policy. The policy adopted by previous cabinets, cooperating with countries that are beneficial to resolving the "China Incident," and abandoning countries that obstruct Japan's actions in China, was originally reasonable. However, in the current environment, the new cabinet will first strive to find as many allies as possible to thoroughly implement Japan's foreign policy. Among the countries of the world, there are those who wish to cooperate with Japan, but there are also those who oppose it. Japan will not seek friendly relations with countries that refuse to cooperate with Japan, and will thoroughly liquidate the diplomacy of "appeasing all sides." The "non-intervention" policy, once decided, will be temporarily maintained. The establishment of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere will take Japan, "Manchukuo," and China as its axis. Handling the China Incident remains the most urgent task, with no change in history. It goes without saying that Greater East Asia will include Southeast Asia. The goal is to create a self-sufficient economic unit encompassing Japan, "Manchukuo," China, the Dutch East Indies, Vietnam, and others, to establish a stable factor in East Asia. In short, the time for further explanation of the new cabinet's foreign policy has not yet arrived, and a concrete announcement will be made when the time comes. Judging from his remarks, the so-called "non-intervention" policy is gradually changing, but this may inevitably contain the effect of threatening Britain and the United States. (2nd Dispatch)

London: Today's editorial in the Daily Telegraph stated that the policy statement issued by the new Japanese government and the remarks by Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka clarifying this policy were both sharply worded and unclear in meaning. The diplomatic policy now proclaimed by Japan is substantially the same as that announced by former Foreign Minister Arita. Matsuoka did not provide further explanation, except to say that French Vietnam and the Dutch East Indies are within the scope of Japan's objectives. What Matsuoka added was a provocative statement that Japan will not shake hands with any foreign country that refuses to cooperate with Japan's current plans. In the three years of Japan's war against China, the rapid turnover of cabinets has been bewildering, but their nature has been the same. Each new cabinet takes office with a program to end the war with more severe actions than the previous cabinet. Therefore, today both Matsuoka and Konoe have the complete resolution of the China situation as their primary goal. Although Japan will currently not interfere in European affairs, it will use the changes in the international situation to express hostile words towards Britain and the United States and focus on the Dutch East Indies to advance its objectives. It is regrettable that the Japanese government has been forced to expose this attitude. It is expected that the Japanese militarists will protest vehemently against the United States' refusal to supply them with scrap iron, oil, or aviation fuel, but they are in this difficulty through their own fault and cannot blame others. The ambitions of Japanese militarism, as applied to China's national interests and the general well-being of the world, have caused great harm. Apart from Britain, no country is more affected than the United States. Japanese politicians must understand that they cannot expect to rely on American resources to prolong the brutal acts in the war against China. The day of subjugating China is no closer than it was three years ago, which is a clear fact. Japan's military strength is being depleted in the provinces of China to a great extent, and its important war materials have now been completely deprived and cannot be obtained. Threats against the Dutch East Indies will not help the overall situation. The prosperity of East Asia is Japan's true interest, but to achieve this goal, only peaceful means can be taken.

### Outline of Japan's Basic National Policy

Hong Kong, Tokyo 1st Dispatch: After the establishment of the Konoe Cabinet, a four-minister conference was held on the 19th of last month to decide on the outline of national policies for building a new order in East Asia and dealing with the world situation. The cabinet officially decided on it today, and the government immediately announced its content at home and abroad. The outline is as follows: (1) (Fundamental Policy) Based on the spirit of the universal brotherhood of mankind, seek to establish world peace. The first step is to build a new order in Greater East Asia with Japan as its core and the strong combination of China, Japan, and Manchukuo as its foundation. Therefore, Japan itself will also quickly establish a national system adapted to the new situation and devote all its national strength to advancing. (2) (National Defense and Diplomacy) In view of the new situation at home and abroad, the national defense and national system that exert the overall strength of the country should be the foundation for strengthening military preparations. Current diplomacy is based on building a new order in Greater East Asia. First, place its focus on ending the China Incident, examine major international changes, and consider constructive and flexible strategies to advance the country's destiny. (3) (Reforms of the Domestic System) The urgent task of domestic politics is to reform various policies based on the true meaning of the national polity and establish the foundation of the national defense and national system. Because of the following points, it is necessary to realize them: (A) On the one hand, reform education to suit the true meaning of the national polity, and at the same time, reject the ideology of self-serving studies and establish a national morality that takes serving the country and the public as the primary principle. (B) Establish a strong new political system to achieve comprehensive unity of national politics. (2nd Dispatch)

### Japan Arrests Two More British Nationals; British Ambassador Conducts Negotiations; Spokesperson of the Japanese Foreign Ministry States that Any Protest from the British Side Will Be Rejected

London: According to official sources here today, two more British nationals have been arrested by the Japanese authorities in Korea. One is the Anglican minister Mr. Chatwin, and the other is Mr. Sanford. The British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, has made representations to the Japanese side regarding this matter. Nothing has been heard here regarding the crimes they are accused of. A total of nine British nationals are currently detained in Japan. (2nd Reuters Dispatch)

Tokyo: Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Mr. Hinuma Yoshiro recently stated that the Japanese government will reject any protests from the British side regarding the arrest of British individuals in Japan on suspicion of espionage. The spokesman pointed out that this case is entirely a domestic matter and does not fall within the scope of foreign protests. Suma made these remarks in response to inquiries from journalists, who asked whether the Japanese government would ignore any British protests regarding the Japanese arrest of British nationals. The spokesman continued, saying that the arrest of British nationals is necessary to maintain Japan's domestic peace and order and is carried out in accordance with Japanese law. Therefore, this case should be completely classified as a domestic matter. However, Suma acknowledged that this matter has some other aspects. He then admitted that this move is a result of Japan's changing foreign policy. The spokesman pointed out that, in essence, there has been no absolute change in Japan's national policy, but there may be some changes in foreign policy to adapt to the new international situation. (2nd Associated Press Dispatch)

London: Reliable sources here learned last night that Japan has released six arrested British nationals but charged them with attempted espionage, which is not satisfactory to the British government. Unless the Japanese military police quickly release the seven British nationals who are still detained, Britain may take special action. It is recalled here that the arrest of thirteen British nationals by Japan without warning has made a very deep impression on the British. Japan's retention of the documents of the six released individuals, indicating that Japan may still prosecute them, has further displeased the British. According to authoritative sources, the British Ambassador to Tokyo, Sir Robert Craigie, has protested to the Japanese government, demanding an explanation for the arrest incident. Recently, the intelligence department of the Japanese military clearly declared Britain to be a "hostile power." Responsible parties here believe that Japan is deliberately excluding British and other foreign interests in China. However, they express doubt about Japan's reconsideration of a large-scale war with Britain. Their meaning may be that Britain is also strongly aware that in the final stages of the development of the situation in the Far East, Japan may have demands for Hong Kong. General observers here believe that Hong Kong is not a place that can be defended for long, but they analyze that if Japan attacks the area, it will face military resistance. There is strong confidence here that any action by Japan against Singapore will recognize Britain's stronger position. (2nd Associated Press Dispatch)

### The Remains of Ma Junwu Were Placed in a Coffin Yesterday

Guilin: Since becoming the president of National Guangxi University, Ma Junwu has spared no effort in planning and managing the university, paying attention to both spiritual and material aspects, and the university's affairs have been thriving. However, due to his old age and weak health, he suffered a relapse of stomach disease on the night of the 28th of last month. On the morning of the 29th, he was treated by famous doctors, and both acupuncture and medicine were used. He improved slightly the next day. On the morning of the following day, his pulse suddenly rose to more than 130 beats per minute, and his heart weakened further. He passed away in his residence on campus at 6:00 PM on the 1st. His two sons, Baozhi and Hengzhi, were at his bedside. His remains were placed in a coffin on the 2nd. The university has sent telegrams to Chairman Chiang and the Ministry of Education to report the matter and has scheduled a meeting of the university affairs committee to discuss ways to maintain the university's affairs.

### The Joint Session of the Two Houses of the Soviet Union Unanimously Approves Foreign Policy: Maintaining Neutrality and Never Participating in War; Representatives of the Three Baltic States Attended

Moscow: The Federal Council and the National Council held a joint session today, and the situation was extremely enthusiastic. The speakers of the two houses were all present at 7:00 PM in the evening. In addition, the representatives of the Dahanov faction, workers from the Moscow factory, and Red Army personnel were present. There were no empty seats in the crowded venue. At exactly 7:00, Stalin, Molotov, Voroshilov, Kalinin, Kaganovich, Mikoyan, Zhetnov, Khrushchev, Beria, Malenkov, Timoshenko, and the speakers and deputy speakers of the two houses of the Supreme Soviet entered the venue. The guests all stood up and cheered for several minutes, congratulating Stalin and his comrades.

The Speaker of the Federal Council, Mr. Anduyev, announced the opening of the meeting and stated that the representatives of the Plenipotentiary Committees of Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia and the Baybu region were all present. At this time, the entire venue responded with warm cheers. Mr. An also congratulated the Plenipotentiary Representatives on behalf of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. The conference then began to discuss the first item on the agenda. Molotov immediately stood up to report, and the entire venue also stood up and cheered for the head of the Soviet government. Mr. Mo reported for an hour, and the audience paid attention to the content of the report every minute, expressing satisfaction with the victory of the Soviet Union's peaceful policies. When Mr. Mo announced the resolution of the Soviet-Romanian disputes for 22 years, the recovery of the Baybu region, and the establishment of Soviet power in the three Baltic countries, the crowd responded with cheers again. In conclusion, Molotov quoted Stalin as saying, "We should always be in a state of mobilization and be prepared to deal with any military attack so that all the enemy's tricks cannot be implemented." After Mr. Mo finished speaking, the crowd gave him even warmer cheers.

Then, Congressman Stibakov delivered a speech, pointing out the victories achieved by the Soviet Union's peaceful policies and saying that the Soviet people unanimously agreed with the government's policies and measures. Finally, on the motion of Mr. Shi, the conference decided not to debate the foreign policy report any further. So, amid cheers from the crowd, the conference passed the conference's foreign policy. (1st Tass Dispatch)

### Molotov's Foreign Policy Report

Moscow. Molotov, Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars and People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, reported on the government's foreign policy at a joint session of the Council of the Union and the Council of Nationalities. When Molotov rose to speak, all the deputies of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union stood up and paid tribute to Molotov and Stalin, the leader of all nationalities. The cheering shook the entire venue. The original text of Molotov's speech is as follows:

"Comrades and deputies, it has been four months since the last congress. During this period, extremely important events have occurred in Europe. German military operations have expanded from Norway, Denmark, Belgium, and the Netherlands to France, thus further escalating the European war. On June 10, Italy joined the German side and declared war on Britain and France. Thus, the fourth major European power was drawn into the war. Since the spring, the European war has continued to develop due to the events in Norway, Denmark, Belgium, and the Netherlands. I would particularly like to emphasize the speed of the French defeat. Within a month or six weeks, the German army not only broke through the French resistance but also forced France to sign an armistice agreement. According to this agreement, a large part of France (including Paris) is under German occupation.

France Has Not Yet Achieved Peace

Although France has now achieved an armistice, it has not yet achieved peace. The terms of peace have not yet been ascertained. The only Allied power left to confront Germany and Italy is Britain. The British authorities have decided to continue fighting with American aid. France has fully demonstrated its weakness in wartime. There is no need to elaborate on the reasons for France's defeat. In short, France's defeat was not only due to insufficient military preparation. An important reason was that the French ruling class excessively underestimated the power of the Soviet Union in European affairs. The facts of the past few months have proven the more important reason for the French defeat. The French authorities failed to connect with the people. They not only did not regard the people as the main force but also placed the freedom-loving French people in an unimportant position. This is the most serious factor in France's weakness. The French people now intend to compensate for the post-war trauma, but this task is by no means easy. After all, the restoration of the country cannot be achieved by old methods.

Germany Has Not Achieved Its Main Goal

Although Germany has achieved great success in the war, it has not yet achieved its main goal. In other words, to end the war on terms that Germany desires.

On July 19, the German leader made another peace proposal to Britain, but as far as we know, the British side has rejected the proposal. The British government also believes that the proposal is a demand for Britain to surrender and stated that it will not stop fighting unless it wins. At the same time, the British side also declared that it would sever relations with its former ally, France.

This indicates that Britain is unwilling to give up its colonies scattered around the world. Although Britain is now in a more unfavorable position due to the defeat of France and Italy's participation in the war, it will still fight for world hegemony.

The first year of the European war is coming to an end, but the end of the entire war is still far away. We are now on the eve of a fierce battle between Germany, Italy, Britain, and the United States. Although all these facts have not caused the Soviet Union to change its foreign policy, in order to comply with the policy of peace and neutrality, the Soviet Union will not join the war.

Absolutely Abide by the German-Soviet Agreement

German-Soviet relations have undergone an important transformation as a result of the agreement signed a year ago. The Soviet government absolutely abides by the agreement. When the Soviet Union implemented its policies in the West, no disputes occurred with Germany. This was achieved thanks to the conclusion of the German-Soviet agreement. At the same time, after the completion of the agreement, Germany no longer had to worry about the East. The recent changes in the European situation have not only not weakened the power of the German-Soviet non-aggression pact but have also proven the importance of the pact. Recently, foreign newspapers, especially British newspapers, have repeatedly speculated on the possibility of German-Soviet discord and threatened us with the expansion of German power. In fact, we and Germany have dismissed such rumors and threats with a smile. We would like to solemnly state that the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Germany are entirely based on the common interests of the two countries and are by no means an accidental transitional measure.

Relations with Italy Have Also Improved

Recently, our relations with Italy have also improved. As a result of our exchange of views with the Italian side, it has been proven that there is indeed the possibility of reaching an understanding on foreign policy. At the same time, we also expect that trade between the two countries will develop.

Soviet-British Relations Have Not Changed

As for Soviet-British relations, there have been no changes recently. We believe that as a result of Britain's repeated hostile actions towards us, the relations between the two countries have been unable to develop smoothly. Although Britain sent Cripps as its ambassador to the Soviet Union, it was indeed an attempt to improve relations with us.

The Soviet Union's Western Border Reaches the Danube

The victory of our foreign policy has further expanded our territory. On this point, I would now like to elaborate. The details of the merger of the Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina regions into the Soviet Union were published on June 28 and do not need to be repeated. The note I sent to the Romanian Minister included two suggestions: (1) Bessarabia should be returned to the Soviet Union; (2) Northern Bukovina should be transferred to the Soviet Union. As a result, the Romanian government accepted the suggestions, and thus the 22-year dispute was resolved. The majority of the residents of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina are Ukrainians and Moldavians. They have been liberated from the Romanian nobles, landlords, and capitalists and have begun to enjoy a new life. Their inner joy is self-evident. Bessarabia has an area of 44,500 square kilometers and a population of 3.2 million. Northern Bukovina has an area of 6,000 kilometers and a population of 500,000. Since the merger of these two regions into the Soviet Union, the territory of the Soviet Union has greatly increased. As a result, the Soviet border has extended to the west, reaching the Danube. The Danube is one of the largest and most important commercial waterways in Europe. The resolution of this incident is extremely popular among the Soviet people. At the same time, our relations with Romania should develop smoothly in the future.

The Baltic States Issue

I will now continue to elaborate on our relations with Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. Since our mutual assistance pact with these three countries has not been successful, important changes have recently taken place in the relations between the Soviet Union and the Baltic states. The above-mentioned pact has not brought the Soviet Union and these three countries closer together due to the opposition of the rulers.

After signing the mutual assistance pact, the Baltic states not only did not get closer to the Soviet Union but also secretly intensified their hostile activities against the Soviet Union, using the so-called Baltic Entente as a tool. The Baltic Entente originally only included Latvia and Estonia, but at the end of last year, Lithuania also joined the military alliance to confront the Soviet Union. This proves that the small capitalist rulers of the three countries have failed to faithfully abide by the mutual assistance pact. On the contrary, they have intensified their anti-Soviet work. The Soviet Union has obtained a great deal of evidence in this regard. Under the current international situation, such behavior is intolerable. Therefore, the Soviet government had no choice but to demand the reorganization of the governments of the three countries and send the Red Army to each of these countries. You are all aware of the results of the steps taken by our government.

After the establishment of pro-Soviet governments in the three countries, their most important task was the general election of the parliament. General elections were held in the Baltic states in July. The results proved that the small capitalist ruling class of the three countries only represented a minority of exploiters and did not represent the will of the people as a whole. The parliaments of the three countries, elected in accordance with direct and secret ballot laws, have expressed their opinions on general political issues. At the same time, the people of Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia have unanimously supported and assisted in the establishment of Soviet power and transformed the three countries into Soviet socialist republics. At this point, the relations between the Soviet Union and the three countries have been placed on a new foundation. After the merger of the three countries into the Soviet Union, their economy and culture can be developed, and their own strength and security can be consolidated. On the other hand, the power of the Soviet Union has also greatly increased due to the merger of the three countries.

After the Baltic states were merged into the Soviet Union, the population of the Soviet Union greatly increased, including 1.95 million people in Latvia, 1.12 million people in Estonia, and 2.88 million people in Lithuania. Adding the Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina regions, the population of the Soviet Union has increased by a total of 10 million people. If we add the 13 million people in Ukraine, the Soviet Union has increased its population by 23 million people in the past year. This part of the population originally belonged to the Soviet Union in 1920 but was forcibly taken away by the Western imperialist powers using the weak military power of the Soviet Union. This part of the population has now been returned to the Soviet Union. At this point, the total population of the Soviet Union has reached 193 million, not including the increase in 1939 and 1940.

The Soviet Union Gains Ice-Free Ports

On the other hand, the Soviet border has extended to the Baltic coast, which is extremely important. At the same time, we have now obtained the ice-free ports that we urgently need. What is more important is that the Soviet Union achieved its goals through peaceful means. The resolution of disputes between the Soviet Union and the Baltic states and its Bessarabia region was entirely due to the support of the people of these countries. The Soviet government should be responsible for the various economic and political construction works in the new republics.

The Soviet-Finnish Peace Treaty Is Smoothly Implemented

At the last congress, I reported on the Soviet-Finnish Peace Treaty. Since the signing of the treaty, more than four months have passed, and the treaty has been smoothly implemented. In addition, the two countries have also concluded a trade agreement, and the development of future economic relations is immeasurable. The Soviet Union's proposal to disarm the Åland Islands has also been accepted by the Finnish side. The Soviet Union is now setting up a consulate there.

Whether future Soviet-Finnish relations can be further improved depends entirely on the efforts of the Finnish side itself. If some elements of the Finnish ruling class do not stop their illegal activities that harm pro-Soviet personnel, Soviet-Finnish relations will be hit.

Develop Economic Relations with Sweden

Our relations with the Scandinavian countries (Norway and Sweden) are entirely dependent on the current situation in the region. Norway's current status is special, and it is impossible to draw a conclusion rashly. As for Sweden, one point is worth noting: both sides are willing to develop trade and economic relations. The two sides are currently conducting negotiations on this point. I sincerely hope that the negotiations will result in an agreement that will benefit both sides.

Diplomacy in the Balkans

Regarding the Balkans, we have established diplomatic relations with Yugoslavia. The failure to establish diplomatic relations between the two countries in the past was not the fault of the Soviet Union. However, the establishment of this relationship was proposed by Yugoslavia and accepted by the Soviet Union. I sincerely hope that Soviet-Yugoslav relations can also gradually improve. Our relations with Bulgaria have returned to normal. There are no obstacles to the further improvement of Soviet-Bulgarian relations.

Relations with Turkey Have Not Changed

Our relations with Turkey have not changed. As a result of the recent publication of the German White Paper, certain unpleasant activities on the Turkish side have been discovered. Although the French ambassador to Turkey has provided explanations, he has still failed to change the contents of the document. In early April, the Soviet government notified the Turkish side that the Soviet authorities could not tolerate the following fact: in early April, a Turkish aircraft flew over the Baku area, which is full of oil refineries. Initially, the Turkish side completely denied that the aircraft came from Turkish territory. However, in the end, the Turkish side agreed to take steps to prevent similar incidents from happening. After the publication of the German documents, it goes without saying which side the aircraft belonged to. The protests made by the people to the Turkish government are also reasonable.

Strengthen Surveillance of Iran's Attitude

As for Iran, no major events have occurred, but there are also intolerable facts. At the end of March, two aircraft from Iran arrived in the Baku area. Although the Iranian government has denied this, the German White Paper contains a full explanation. We believe that this kind of aircraft activity will inevitably make our relations with the neighboring country more complicated. As a result of this aircraft activity, we will strengthen our surveillance on the southern border in the future.

Relations with Japan May Improve

Recent relations with Japan have begun to take on a normal character. On June 9, an agreement was reached on the exact demarcation of the area of conflict that occurred in the Khalkhin Gol last year. This is extremely important because the delay in resolving this matter has hindered the adjustment of Soviet-Japanese and Mongolian-Manchukuo relations. In a few days, the joint demarcation committee composed of both sides will begin its work. In general, the Japanese side seems to have a tendency to improve relations. If both sides can recognize the need to remove obstacles, then the improvement of Soviet-Japanese relations is not impossible. Although the so-called "new political structure" plan of the new Japanese government is not very clear, the slogan of the Japanese government's southward advance has attracted the attention of the main aspects of Japan, because this aspect is extremely interested in the changes in Europe. Although, in many aspects, their political ambitions are not yet clear. The same is true of Soviet-Japanese relations.

Unwilling to Comment on Soviet-American Relations

Regarding Soviet-American relations, we are unwilling to comment because the situation between the two countries is still lackluster. It is said that some aspects of the United States have expressed dissatisfaction with the Soviet Union's diplomatic victory in the Baltic states. In fact, we do not care about this because we do not need the cooperation of these gentlemen to carry out our work. Although, recently, our National Bank purchased cash from the Baltic states, the US authorities illegally prohibited exports. We must lodge a serious protest against this. Regarding this matter, we can only mention to the British and American governments the great responsibility for their illegal acts. As for our relations with great China, since the signing of the non-aggression pact between the two countries, everything has been extremely friendly. China is now fighting for survival.

The Colonial Issue Is Sharpened

I do not wish to elaborate on our relations with other countries. I will only make a brief statement on international changes. Since the German army won the victory, the European situation has changed, but the time to quickly end the war has not yet arrived. Since Germany won the victory, its national strength has greatly increased. On the other hand, Britain is feeling difficult to continue the war. As for France, since being defeated, it is still encountering a serious crisis. This shift in the strength of power has not only had a major reaction in Europe, but other parts of the world will also be affected.

In addition to France, the defeated countries also include the Netherlands and Belgium. The Netherlands has huge colonies, but its strength is not enough to defend its colonies. Therefore, the issue of redistributing colonies has become more acute.

The desire for imperialism is possessed not only by Japan but also by the United States. In the United States, some people use "concern" as a smokescreen for their imperialist plans. They intend to claim "the entire Western Hemisphere" as their own. As for the colonies of various countries near the American continent, the United States also intends to seize them. All of this is enough to expand the war and make it an imperialist world war.

Strengthen National Power to Prepare for Contingencies

Under these circumstances, the Soviet Union has no choice but to consolidate its internal and external position. We have now implemented an eight-hour day and a seven-day week system so that we can carry out the task of strengthening national power, rectifying discipline, and increasing production power.

Although we have achieved considerable success, we are not complacent about this. In order to achieve further victories, we should bear in mind Stalin's words: "We should always be in a state of mobilization and be prepared to deal with any military attack so that all the enemy's tricks cannot be implemented.

"If we bear this in mind, then we will never be taken advantage of by others and will win more glorious victories for the Soviet Union." (TASS dispatch on the 2nd)

### British and American Comments on Molotov's Speech

London. Responsible people here have criticized certain points in the speech made by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov at the opening of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, saying that if, as Molotov claimed, Sir Cripps' appointment as ambassador to the Soviet Union was prompted by a desire to improve British-Soviet relations, then when the Soviet Union expressed its willingness to hold trade negotiations, the British side appointed Cripps as ambassador to the Soviet Union, with full power to continue trade discussions, hoping to gain the cooperation of the Soviet Union. This discussion will produce results and prove to be an important factor in improving general relations. However, in view of Molotov's statement that the British Empire is now preparing to continue the war to gain world hegemony, the British side must declare that the British Empire's continuation of the war is necessary to resist world hegemony. (Reuters dispatch on the 2nd)

Washington. After the speech of Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov was first transmitted to the United States, an impression arose here that the statement that the Soviet border extended to the Danube was a challenging move against the ambitions of Germany and Italy in the Balkans. As for Molotov's mention of the United States, it is not surprising, but the public feels that it may not be conducive to the success of the talks being held in Washington. (Reuters dispatch on the 2nd)

### The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union Passes Six Items on the Agenda, Including the Merger of the Baltic States

Moscow. The seventh session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union opened today at the Kremlin Palace.

Andreyev, Chairman of the Council of the Union, immediately announced the opening of the meeting and invited Shcherbakov, Chairman of the Secretariat of the Soviet Union, to report on the results of the examination of the election documents of Gubiyev, the representative of the Karelo-Finnish Federal Republic. (Gubiyev is the Deputy of the Council of the Union elected from the Vyborg District.) Finally, it was unanimously recognized that Gubiyev's credentials were mostly authentic. At this point, the Chairman announced the agenda of the Congress as follows:

(2) Report on the Government's Foreign Policy,

(2) The issue of merging the Guta, Anke, and Ismail districts of Northern Bukovina and Bessarabia into the Ukrainian Republic and the establishment of the Moldavian Soviet Republic,

### German Aircraft Bombard London, Drop Bombs in Norwich, and Scatter "Peace" Leaflets Everywhere. British Aircraft Groups Constantly Fly to Bomb Germany

London. Just after receiving news last night that German aircraft had come from the southeast and southwest of Britain and the northeast of Scotland, groups of German aircraft were seen hovering over various areas of Britain, launching deadly attacks on towns across the country. When attacking the densely populated town of Norwich, German aircraft suddenly descended and strafed residents on the streets with machine guns, killing five and injuring countless others. Afterwards, a German aircraft dropped several incendiary bombs on Norwich, causing several fires. It is generally believed that the city's property losses were enormous. Other air raids were scattered throughout, with minor damage. (International News Agency dispatch on the 2nd)

London. Yesterday afternoon, a German aircraft suddenly emerged from the clouds over the town of Norwich (114 miles northwest of London), descended rapidly to about 400 feet, and dropped bombs, killing five people and injuring several others. One bomb destroyed part of a warehouse, and another bomb hit another house. A bomb hit a restaurant, and the roof was blown off. According to the Ministry of Internal Security, an enemy aircraft flew very high over the east coast in the afternoon. Enemy aircraft activity elsewhere was limited to flying over the English Channel from time to time. Two enemy aircraft were shot down over the English Channel last night, and a British fighter plane that flew out on patrol did not return. (Reuters dispatch on the 2nd)

London. A German aircraft flew to a town in southeastern England yesterday afternoon, bombing and strafing it, causing the windows of shops and houses to be shattered. A fire broke out at one location, with minor casualties. British aircraft took off to pursue. (Reuters dispatch on the 2nd)

London. Last night and this morning, German aircraft launched fierce attacks in the southern and southwestern regions of Britain, dropping bombs and scattering leaflets with "The Last Chance for the British." The content was still the words of Hitler's speech on July 19, namely, "Do you want peace or destruction?" The title of the leaflet was "Hitler's Last Appeal to Reason." While German aircraft were scattering these leaflets, it was also reported from Grenoble that German troops from the Spanish border to the Belgian border had begun to move to the coastal ports of northern France. These leaflets were dropped from aircraft flying at extremely high altitudes. The aircraft were obviously avoiding contact with anti-aircraft balloons and avoiding the illumination of searchlights in order to be able to fly back and forth in the sky during air raid alerts to scatter leaflets. When residents left the air raid shelters and returned home after the alerts were lifted, they saw the roads full of these leaflets. This morning, three or four thousand incendiary bombs were dropped by German aircraft on northern Britain, but no casualties were reported. The Ministry of Aviation also announced that Wales and eastern England had also been attacked, with minor losses and casualties. (United Press dispatch on the 2nd)

London. The Ministry of Aviation announced that British Air Force bombers attacked German military targets and ships off the Dutch and German coasts on Wednesday. Enemy fighters intercepted them and shot down two of them. A British bomber was lost. That night, British aircraft flew to Merschburg, Osnabrück, and Brook to attack oil refineries and storage depots. Ships in the Suda Sea and enemy airfields in the Netherlands and Germany were also bombed. Two British aircraft were lost. Also on Wednesday, an Australian Air Force Sunderland seaplane escorting a convoy repelled several attacks three times. A Coast Command aircraft flying to Norway for reconnaissance did not return.

### The German Blitzkrieg Has Not Yet Begun, Showing a Lack of Confidence in Victory

Cairo. The Cairo-based non-partisan daily "Al-Mokattam" discussed today the delay in Germany's offensive against the British Isles, saying that Hitler had indeed lost the opportunity to achieve a lightning victory over Britain. The date of the German offensive has been changed repeatedly, and every day that is delayed reduces Hitler's chances of victory and increases Britain's chances of victory. (Reuters dispatch on the 1st)

Rome. Yesterday, when journalists were received here, someone asked why the various Italian newspapers had different opinions on the current strategy of attacking Britain. The spokesman replied that these were all assumptions of the newspapers themselves. Regarding the "Italian News" Wednesday's statement by Gaida that the attack on Britain would not be as fierce as the attack on France, the spokesman said that Gaida's words could not be regarded as the true strategy of attacking Britain. The attack on Britain is now underway, but do not regard what is published in the newspapers as the mouthpiece of the authorities. (Hai Tong dispatch on the 2nd)

### Activities of Libyan Italian Troops Taking on an Offensive Appearance, Italian Ammunition Depot at Bardia Bombed, Flames Rise 500 Feet into the Air

London - Authoritative sources recently stated that a large number of Italian troops have concentrated on the northern front in Libya, which may be a sign that the Italian troops are taking large-scale offensives. Our troops have gradually advanced towards the Egyptian border and are said to be taking extremely cautious steps to deal with British tanks. (2nd United Press)

Cairo - This morning, the British Air Force here issued a communique saying that British bombers yesterday raided a large ammunition depot near Bardia with great effect. The intensity of the explosion was felt even at altitudes above 2,000 feet. The flames rose as high as 500 feet, and black smoke rose to approximately 7,000 inches. When the British planes flew back, they could still see several plumes of rising black smoke from a distance of forty miles. The British planes suffered no casualties. Italian bombers raided Port Sudan without success. British fighter planes encountered an Italian Caproni bomber over the Abyssinian border. After a short engagement, the Italian plane was shot down. (2nd Reuters)

Cairo - The British Air Force here issued a communique stating that a small squadron of British bombers attacked an oil refinery near Massawa. The bombs scored direct hits, and gasoline caught fire and burned. Black smoke could be seen from fifty miles away. The airfield and hangars at Asmara were also attacked by another squadron of British bombers and suffered heavy damage. All British planes returned safely to their defenses. British planes also raided Golan. Although the cloud cover was very low, hindering accurate bombing, they were still able to hit several targets, causing several fires. To the south of Moyale, the South African Air Force bombed troop concentrations with great effect. (2nd Reuters)

Rome - According to the Italian military headquarters, the British fleet sailing out of Gibraltar, including two battleships, two aircraft carriers per ship, and other warships, although equipped with anti-aircraft guns, were still heavily bombed by the Italian Air Force near the Balearic Islands, hitting one battleship and several other warships. The battleship has already caught fire. One Italian plane did not return. The Italian destroyer "Vivaldi" sank a British submarine last night in the Ionian Sea with depth charges. The submarine was equipped with 30mm caliber gun emplacements and eight torpedo tubes. Of the 55 officers and men on board, 53 were rescued by the Italian ship. In East Africa, Italian aircraft bombed various locations in Sudan. Italian troops in the Kassala area destroyed eight British tanks. Italian troops have occupied Dube, 45 kilometers south of Moyale. Enemy counterattacks have been repelled. British aircraft bombed Dire Dawa without results. British planes attacked Asmara and Massawa, killing one Italian and injuring several others. Two British planes were lost. (2nd Haitong Telegraph)

Berlin - A senior German military officer stated today when issuing a military report that the poor weather in western Germany and Britain continued to hinder the Air Force's actions yesterday, but over the English Channel, above the port of Dover, the German Messerschmitt fighter planes still defeated the British Spitfire fighter planes. Five British planes were shot down, while the German side suffered no losses. Not long ago, Britain claimed that its Spitfires were superior to German planes in terms of speed and combat, but yesterday's air battle proved that its claims were inaccurate. The German planes' actions were concentrated attacks on military targets. The British planes that attacked Hanover last night dropped bombs in the clouds. House number 25 on Schiller Street in the city was destroyed, three were heavily damaged, two people were killed, three were seriously injured, and four were slightly injured. It was investigated that there were no military targets in the vicinity of that street. (2nd Haitong Telegraph)

### Spies Arrested in the Panama Canal Zone, Totaling Eighty-One, Nationalities Not Announced

Washington - Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson told reporters here yesterday that the United States has detained eighty-one foreign nationals in Panama, "to deport them or subject them to other punishments." He said that these detainees are currently concentrated at immigration stations, but he did not disclose the nationalities of these individuals. Secretary Stimson also said, "No foreign nationals other than Panamanians are employed in the Canal Zone or in advertising. Foreigners previously employed have now been dismissed." Stimson declined to elaborate on the detention of these eighty-one foreign nationals and did not specify whether they were captured by the military or federal commissioners. Stimson stated that the situation in Panama is considered more dangerous by the War Department than anyone else observes. Although authorities in Balboa told the Associated Press that they were unaware of the arrest, it is reported that German, Austrian, and Jewish refugees have been detained at the Balboa Quarantine Station, pending verification of whether they can enter the United States or other Latin American countries. Currently, the only foreign national detained in Balboa is Dr. Waldorf, who was traveling to Santiago, Chile. He was detained on June 2nd for carrying secret codes from the German Consulate in San Francisco into the Panama Canal Zone and was arrested for questioning. Balboa officials said that it is inaccurate to say that only Americans and Panamanians work in the Panama Canal Zone, as there are still 15,000 Black Britons working in the zone. However, the Panama Canal Zone authorities have clearly excluded German, Austrian, and Italian personnel. (2nd United Press)

It slightly leaned to the left as it passed through the bay and entered the dry dock. According to responsible sources, the Brazilian government has allowed the "Alcantara" to remain docked until repairs are completed, as the engine room was damaged and cannot sail out without repairs. Details of the battle are not yet known.

The German official news agency stated that the German auxiliary cruiser that encountered the "Alcantara" has resumed its merchant ship raiding activities. (3rd Reuters)

Guinello Port - After the British giant auxiliary cruiser "Alcantara" was damaged in a naval battle with a German ship in the South Atlantic and sailed into this port yesterday morning, the Brazilian authorities have now allowed it to remain in the port for 24 hours. According to the neutral country government's previous permission for warships of belligerent countries to stay in port for 24 hours, the British ambassador to Brazil has requested the Brazilian authorities to extend the stay due to the heavy damage to the "Alcantara" and the impossibility of completing the repairs in a short time. The ship is now guarded by foreign police in the port, and no one other than official representatives is allowed to board or disembark. It is understood that two British soldiers were killed and seven were seriously injured and have left the ship. The remaining twenty-three slightly injured remain on board. (2nd Haitong Agency)

London - The German "Popular Newspaper" of July 17th published an article stating that the penetrating power of British incendiary bombs is stronger than usually estimated, and the range and penetrating power of explosive bomb fragments are also not as low as estimated. The destructive power of the fragments that cause death and destruction is truly unbelievable. We have seen fragments as large as fists penetrate an oak door and two layers of thick iron on a safe. Even thick walls cannot withstand them. The nightly air raids by British planes cause unbearable nervous tension. The newspaper published an article on July 14th, titled "The Bombing of Hamburg," stating briefly that it has become a habit to take refuge in air raid shelters every night. People are surprised if there are no British air raids and speculate about the reason for the peaceful night. Another newspaper on July 17th stated that there is hardly a night without enemy planes flying high and dropping bombs on Germany. (2nd Reuters)

### The World's Most Luxurious Pawnshop

Foreigners who have resided in the capital of Argentina for a short time invariably ask Argentinians, "What is that place called 'Casa De Ventas'? Is it a department store?"

Argentinians find it hard to answer this question enough. It turns out that the magnificent Casa De Ventas is a municipal pawnshop, but on the surface, it looks like a department store. In fact, it is a novel form of commerce. Its headquarters and six branches employ over 1,100 people, and its business aims to benefit the people. Among the pawned items it lends against, there are as many as 10,000 sewing machines and 2,500 pianos, which shows the scale of its operations. It also lends to various cities to help them build roads and repay debts. In 1934, it lent 21 million pesos to the city government of the Argentine capital, equivalent to about US$4,830,000.

Ordinary pawnshops in foreign countries are usually located in narrow alleys, nothing more than a dirty little house, with old watches and other sundries piled up in the display window. People would never want to step into a pawnshop unless they were at their wit's end.

But it is not so in the capital of Argentina. The pawnshop there is managed by the municipal government. Citizens enter and leave the pawnshop as if they were entering a bank, dignified and without shame. It does its best to serve the poor citizens.

This pawnshop is located in the city center, in a refined five-story new building. Unredeemed pawned items are displayed publicly for several days before the auction. There are several display windows, arranged in a semi-circle, with neat and elegant decorations, comparable to a department store.

For example, one display window is decorated as a dining room, displaying beautiful tables and chairs, bowls and plates, paintings, and electric clocks, with small labels attached, indicating the number and minimum bid price. Other display windows display various radios, leather goods, typewriters, and musical instruments, all arranged spaciously and pleasingly, in an orderly manner.

The most interesting figure in the auction room is a type of agent. If you cannot go to the venue to shop in person, you only need to pay a five-cent handling fee and a 20% deposit. An agent will bid on your behalf during the auction, up to the price you have secretly pre-determined. The deal may be closed even if it does not reach the price you specified.

There is another convenience for customers who buy goods. If you want to buy a certain item but do not see it on display, you only need to leave your name and phone number, and you will be notified when the item is available for sale. This kind of service is truly a win-win for both the pawner and the buyer. Buyers can buy what they want at will, without inconvenience or wasting time. The pawnshop sells the pawned items, deducts the interest due from the profits, and returns the remaining funds to the original owner of the pawned item.

The Bustling Pawnshop in the Capital of Argentina

At the corner of this pawnshop, facing a small square, is an appraisal room, with a constant stream of people entering and leaving. It is common for citizens of the capital of Argentina to pawn items. It can be said that they live by borrowing money. Whether purchasing clothing, shoes, or even cars, they all pay in installments. They are fond of spending lavishly, so they have to turn to this municipal pawnshop for help.

Ordinary citizens enter the appraisal room calmly, just like entering other public places. The appraisal room is also as polite to the pawners as ordinary shops are to customers, asking them to wait in a small room, while the staff takes the items to be pawned to the appraiser. The original owner of the pawned item and the appraiser never meet, to prevent collusion. Once the appraisal is completed, the pawner leaves with the money, never arguing about the amount, knowing that the pawn money obtained will definitely be more than at other private pawnshops.

This pawnshop accepts any kind of pawned item, and there is no limit to the loan amount. It once accepted a diamond, with a pawn of as much as 120,000 pesos (equivalent to US$27,600). It also once accepted an airplane, which it later had to sell for about ten yuan. Many wedding dresses are pawned, but wedding rings are not easily pawned unless one is completely impoverished. Many sewing machines are also pawned. To save storage space and for the convenience of the original owner, this pawnshop often allows the original owner to keep the sewing machine for use.

This pawnshop is often called the cloakroom of the capital of Argentina, because some people pawn clothes simply to store them.

Some people have been paying interest on pawned items for more than ten years. Once, a woman pawned a piano, which had been there for 25 years. The pawnshop management decided to return it to the original owner. No small number of telescopes are pawned. It turns out that some people lose at horse racing, pawn their telescopes on Sunday, get their weekly salary on Saturday, and then redeem them to watch the races as usual. However, not everyone who is addicted to horse racing can redeem their pawned items. For example, a certain laundress pawned a shirt entrusted to her by a customer, lost a lot of money betting on horses, and when the customer asked for the shirt, she actually gave the pawn ticket to the customer to redeem it themselves.

However, all employees of this pawnshop are not allowed to enter the racetrack. They receive generous salaries and various benefits for a stable and happy life. For example, if the monthly salary is not 104 yuan, they receive a subsidy of 100 pesos (equivalent to US$23) for each child born, and are also given a baby carriage and clothing.

Since its establishment in 1878, this pawnshop has faithfully fulfilled its mission of serving the public. Now it is actively engaged in charitable work, drawing lots each year to return winter clothes and blankets pawned by the poor. In 1938, it funded the construction of tuberculosis sanatoriums and outpatient clinics for hospitals to benefit the poor and sick. People in South America call it a pawnshop with a conscience, which it truly deserves.

### Abundant Water in Northern Jiangsu and the Lower Reaches of Rivers; Xingdong Ferry Resumes Service; Rice Prices Also Decline

Taixian Correspondent: Due to the previous drought and lack of rain in various counties of Northern Jiangsu, the rivers in the lower reaches dried up, making it impossible to irrigate farmland and draw water. It was decided to open the Baojia Dam to divert water from the Yangtze River into the lower reaches. Recently, with continuous heavy rain, the farmland has been sufficiently watered, and the water volume in the lower reaches has increased. On the 25th, the township chiefs of Taixian County led civilians to block the dam. Also, because the water levels in the upper and lower reaches of the Taixian River were low, transportation was inconvenient. As a result, the ferry services on various lines were forced to stop. Recently, with continuous heavy rain and a sudden rise in the Huai River, the water levels in the upper and lower reaches have increased. To facilitate transportation, various ferry companies have begun to resume services. In addition to the Xing (Hua) Tai (Xian) ferry, which was the first to resume service on the 24th, the Tai (Xian) Dong (Tai) ferry continued to resume service on the 26th. The ferries to Haian, Taixing, and other places will also resume service within the next few days.

Another report: After continuous rain in Taixian County, the source of rice in the lower reaches has been abundant. On the 24th, the price of rice was 26 yuan, which was two or three yuan lower than before. On the 25th, due to the entry of new rice into the market, the number of old rice sold was also greater than in the past. As a result, the price of rice fell sharply. The current price of high-quality rice is 25 yuan per stone, medium-quality rice is 24 yuan, and low-quality rice is 23 yuan. The output of new rice is still good, with a market price of 20 yuan per stone. According to people in the land and grain industry, if various grains are no longer smuggled out of the country, there is still a possibility of a large drop in prices.

### Guangxi Provincial Government Formulates Measures for Middle School Students' Service; Graduation Certificates Will Only Be Issued to Those Who Pass; Service for Two Years Guarantees Admission to Senior High School or Normal School

(Guilin Telegram) Guangxi Province is implementing universal national education, which requires a large number of teachers. To remedy the shortage of teachers and to supervise students who have completed the early stage of their studies in public and private junior middle schools to serve in national primary schools to meet the urgent needs of universal national education and to increase their social service experience, the Provincial Government has specially formulated the "Implementation Measures for Students Who Have Completed the Early Stage of Studies in Junior Middle Schools and National Middle Schools in Guangxi Province to Serve in National Education." It stipulates that all public and private junior middle schools in the province must set up teacher training courses in the third academic year in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Education, and national middle schools must strengthen teacher training and education services in the second academic year. After passing the graduation examination, all students who do not take the senior high school entrance exam must serve in a designated county's national primary school for one semester in the next academic year. Students of county-run schools should serve in their home county or the county where the middle school is located. Students of provincial schools should serve in the counties in the district where they are located. Students assigned to serve should not request changes without compelling reasons and must report to the school for work before the start of the school year. The students serving this time will be assigned to serve as substitute teachers in national primary schools at all levels, and full-time positions will be the principle. Living expenses will be determined by each county in accordance with the salary standards of teachers in the county. Travel expenses for arrival and departure will be issued by the province. Each middle school should form a service student guidance committee to guide and assess students. After the service period expires, the county government will conduct a thorough examination of the service. Those who pass will be given a service certificate, and those who fail will have their service extended for one semester until they pass. Graduation certificates will only be issued by the original school in accordance with regulations after passing the service performance. Those who have not yet received a certificate and wish to continue their studies may take the exam with a service certificate. Those who wish to continue serving may directly report to the county government where they serve or the county government of their origin to request priority employment. Those who serve for more than two years with excellent results may be guaranteed admission to the senior high school normal school without examination for further study and may participate in the elementary school teacher examination and certification.

### News from the Department of Education of Zhejiang University

(Zunyi Correspondent) The Department of Education of National Zhejiang University was established quite early, at the beginning of the establishment of the University in the 17th year of the Republic of China. It was initially affiliated with the College of Arts and Sciences. Because there were not many students, it was combined with the Department of Chinese and the Department of English into the first group. The following year, Zheng Zonghai, Meng Xiancheng, and Yu Ziyi were hired to teach at the school. Zheng also served as the head of the department. After the 19th year, two doctors, Huang Yi and Shen Yougan, arrived successively. All courses such as education and psychology were gradually opened and a large number of psychological instruments, charts, and testing materials were purchased, and a psychological laboratory was established. In the 22nd year, Professor Meng resigned, and Dr. Zhuang Zexuan, director of the Institute of Education of Sun Yat-sen University, was hired to take office. Since then, domestic and foreign educational and psychological books and newspapers have been collected, and a library has been opened for students to read and refer to freely. A training institute was also established to test the process of children's behavioral development and the methods of guidance and treatment. From the 23rd year, the department was divided into education and psychology groups, allowing students to choose to study according to their inclinations. In the autumn of the 25th year, Zhu Kezhen was appointed president of Zhejiang University, and Zheng Xiaocang was appointed provost. The head of the department was changed to Zhuang Zexuan concurrently. Later, the War of Resistance began, and the school moved west, going through three or four places before it was slightly settled. Many professors also moved elsewhere. Director Zhuang Zexuan went to Hong Kong to lecture, and Professor Meng was appointed to succeed him. Soon Meng left, and Professor Huang acted as the director again. Lei Peihong, Zhang Gunian, and Jiang Zhenjun once served as professors in the department. In the autumn of the 28th year, President Zhu successively hired Chen Li, Hu Jiajian (concurrently director of the Experimental Middle School), Li Xiangxu (concurrently director of the Normal College), Jiang Qi (concurrently director of University Training), Chen Jianxiao (concurrently director of University Training), and Peng Baichuan (concurrently director of the first grade) from Chongqing, Shanghai, Kunming, Guilin, and other places to be professors. Because Huang Yi resigned from his concurrent position as acting head of the department, Chen Jianxiao was appointed to succeed him. At this time, the department began to restore its former scale and was moving towards normal education and academic research, in order to create good teachers for secondary schools, local educational administrative cadres, and a small number of people who continued to study educational psychology. Fortunately, the original instruments, charts, books, and magazines from England, America, and Germany are still abundant, and there was not much loss after they were taken out. They are still being supplemented. In Zunyi, where the school is located, houses have been rented as laboratories, and professors guide students to conduct research on school systems, training, statistics, testing, teaching materials and methods for primary and secondary schools, and to conduct experiments on child psychology, learning processes, and emotional development. All of the above have been arranged, and the work has made considerable progress. Although the equipment has not been improved due to wartime funding and time constraints, the department is striving to adapt to the environment with its inherent good foundation and the efforts of current teachers and students. Currently, the department has seven professors, one lecturer, three teaching assistants, and fifty-seven students. About seventy graduates have worked in various educational institutions in Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Hong Kong, and Chongqing with remarkable results. Four students will graduate this summer and have been introduced to work. However, in the autumn of the 27th year, the school was ordered by the Ministry of Education to add a Normal College. From that year, the students recruited by the department were assigned to the Normal College, and those recruited in the past were still assigned to the College of Arts. The department is affiliated with the two colleges and complements each other. In the future, the department will be responsible for providing educational subjects to the Chinese, English, history, geography, mathematics, physics, and chemistry departments of the Normal College, and for guiding primary and secondary education in Guizhou and Guangxi. Dean Mei Guangdi of the College of Arts and Dean Wang of the Normal College both have rich knowledge and experience in education, and Director Chen is also an expert in education. There is no doubt that they will be able to work together to develop the department.

### Finance　The Statutory Exchange Rate for the Pound Sterling Remains Unchanged, Commercial Exchange Rate Slightly Adjusted, Changed from the Original Seven Pence to Four and a Half Pence

Yesterday's foreign exchange market conditions: HSBC's exchange rates remained unchanged. The black market rates for the British and American currencies turned tighter and softer again. Due to a telegram from Chongqing, the Ministry of Finance revised the commercial exchange rate to four and a half pence, leading to a misunderstanding that the legal tender's exchange rate against foreign currencies had decreased. In reality, the Central Bank's listed rates remained unchanged. What has been adjusted this time is the commercial exchange rate of the Bank of Communications of China, which is used for the settlement of exchange for fourteen categories of export goods. Since the government's control of foreign exchange, the export of local goods has always been stipulated to be settled at seven pence with the Bank of Communications of China, while the actual black market exchange rate often fluctuates between three and a half pence and four pence, with an excessively large difference. Those who suffer losses naturally belong to the export merchants. Now, in order to take care of the exporters, the government ordered the Bank of Communications of China to reduce the commercial exchange rate to four and a half pence, only changing the unit of calculation for settlement of exchange. Not only can it encourage exports, but it can also restrict the import of non-essential goods. As for the original value of the legal tender, it has not changed. This can be seen from the fact that the Central Bank's foreign exchange rates have not changed at all yesterday. Moreover, the cash reserve for the amount of legal tender issued still maintains the original statutory ratio. In addition, Jones of the US Reconstruction Bank formally announced that China still has US$22 million in credit loans. It can be seen that the foundation of the legal tender is more solid than imagined. Therefore, although speculators were active everywhere yesterday, pouring out nearly one million US dollars, all banks, including the Central Bank, British Bank, and American Bank, sold them, and the price once softened to US$5.8125 and the British pound softened to 3 pence 8125. Soon, news came from Hong Kong, and foreign banks were willing to supply, and it rebounded slightly, eventually softening again. The closing price was 3 pence 8125 for spot British pounds, US$5.84375, British tight .0625, US tight .125. Futures were only slightly tighter. Swaps have been squared off, and trading was quite active.

Exchange Rates Once Sharply Tightened

In the early morning, the London big strip fell .0625, the forward price remained unchanged, the New York silver price remained the same, and the London gold price was fixed. The exchange rate between the British pound and the US dollar did not change, the exchange rate against Shanghai was the same, and there was no market for the exchange rate against the French franc. The US dollar was up 5 points against the British pound and 2 points against Shanghai, and there was no market for the exchange rate against the French franc. The central exchange rates remained the same. The opening selling prices of spot goods at the bank in the morning were 3 pence 859375 for the British gold and 5 yuan 96875 for the US dollar, which was tighter by .015625 for the British pound and unchanged for the US dollar compared with the evening closing price of the previous day. The speculators then came to tighten the market. It is estimated that the American Bank and Favored Bank sold the August US dollar to Chinese merchants and speculators at 5 yuan 9375 to 875. The exchange rate of HSBC was announced without any change. The silver balance tax was announced to be reduced by 0.25%. After that, the Chinese Bank and the Japanese Bank suddenly came to sell, and although the speculators continued to eat fiercely, the chips were still abundant at that time, and the price rebounded. It is estimated that speculators entered the Chinese Bank, the Mainland Bank, and the Japanese Bank for the August US dollar at 5 yuan 90625 and 9375, but the sellers stopped filling at noon, and the Chinese Bank also had the intention to enter, but the speculators spared no effort to bail out, causing the price to soften again. It is estimated that the American Bank and other banks sold the August US dollar to Chinese banks and speculators at 5 yuan 90625 and 875. In the afternoon, the British gold was 3 pence 84375, and the US dollar was 5 yuan 875, which was .015625 tighter than the British pound opened in the morning, and the US dollar was sharply tighter by .09375.

Hong Kong Telegrams Have Something to Sell

In the afternoon, speculators continued to absorb fiercely, and the August US dollar was entered at 5 yuan 84375. It was also heard that the Netherlands and Favored Bank were doing the August US dollar tightly to 5 yuan 8125. Later, the Hong Kong telegram slightly exited and the market was set, so speculators entered the August US dollar of the American Bank and other banks still at 5 yuan 84375. Later, a few speculators saw the price and sold it. It is estimated that the August US dollar sold to the Chinese Bank returned to 5 yuan 875. The closing price of British gold in the evening was 3 pence 8125, and the US dollar was 5 yuan 84375, which was the same as the spot price this month. The British gold for September was 3 pence 78125, and the US dollar was 5 yuan 78125, which was .0625 tighter than the British gold futures and spot prices of the previous day, and the US dollar futures and spot prices were softer by .125 and .0615.

Hong Kong US Dollar Tightened

Hong Kong, 2nd (Friday) telegram: The exchange market opened flat this morning. The British and Japanese exchange rates did not change. The spot US dollar tightened by .0625 to 23 yuan 125.

The Shanghai exchange rate continued to rise by two yuan for spot goods to 392 yuan.

Tianjin British Tight and American Flat

The spot US dollar did not move and still stood at 5 and a half yuan. The Shanghai exchange rate rose by 25 cents to 107 yuan and 25 cents. The black market for "joint banknotes" did not move and still stood at 94 yuan and 75 cents.

### US Dollar Notes Soared

Yesterday's foreign currency market conditions: Because the new commercial exchange rate between the legal tender and the British pound has been announced, the price of silver ingots soared, and the prices of British and American gold pounds also rose by 3 yuan each. The demand for British gold notes was not bad, and the price rose by 1 yuan. The US dollar once reached 17 yuan and 40 cents, but it soon fell back, once falling back to 16 yuan and 82 cents. In the afternoon, it rose again to 17 yuan and 5 cents, which was 38 cents higher than the closing price of the previous day. The demand for Hong Kong notes was still strong, and the price rose by 1 cent. The prices of Canadian notes and Philippine notes also tended to rise. The price of Japanese gold notes also tended to rise, and the evening market was as high as 1 yuan and 27 cents. The potential trend of Korean notes was very good, and the evening market was as high as 1 yuan and 9 and a half cents.

### In Order to Reset the Commercial Exchange Rate, the Gold Market Rise Re-emerges

Yesterday, the black market for cash silver ingots in this city rose again. In the chaos, the price has exceeded the 5,500 yuan mark. The reason is that the Chongqing telegram reported that the Central Ministry of Finance reset the commercial exchange rate of the Central Bank and the Bank of Communications to 4 and a half pence for the legal tender against the British pound. The people of this city were temporarily stimulated, and foreign exchange suddenly tightened, so the buying trend that had just subsided was reignited. The opening price in the morning rose to 5,480 yuan. When foreign exchange stopped tightening and rebounded, small private banks and gold shops poured out, and then fell, seeing a low price of 5,430 yuan. Soon foreign exchange tightened again, and the buying trend became fierce again. Gold shops, small private banks, retail investors, etc. re-entered, and the price exceeded 5,500 yuan outside the noon moment. A certain jewelry store also entered the market in the afternoon, and the price rose to a high of 5,575 yuan. Unexpectedly, the foreign exchange heard that the Hong Kong telegram supplied it, and it suddenly stopped tightening. Many parties poured out, and it once fell sharply by 90 yuan, entering within 5,500 yuan. It finally rose again with foreign exchange, and the closing price was 5,525 yuan, which was 120 yuan higher. The total transaction volume for the whole day was more than 4,000 taels. The price of jewelry gold rose by 10 yuan to 570 yuan. The customs gold and other items were all flat.

Silver Ingots Rose by One Hundred Nian Yuan

Since the beginning of the morning, each bar (ten taels) was initially due to the report that Chongqing reduced the commercial exchange rate, so although the exchange rate between the US dollar and the British pound reported a increase of 5 points, the people's hearts were quite firm. The opening price actually jumped 75 yuan, and money exchange businesses entered the silver shop with ten taels at 5,480 yuan. Because the exchange market tightened and then suddenly loosened, money exchange businesses and silver shops immediately competed to sell, and soon fell back 50 yuan. Silver shops sold gold shops ten taels, less than 5,430 yuan. Then the selling trend was slightly frustrated, and gold shops suddenly came to absorb, and suddenly increased by 30 yuan. Gold shops entered silver shops with fifty taels at 5,460 yuan. However, after that, a certain gold shop suddenly came to sell fiercely, the amount was not small, and it was repressed to 5,440 yuan. However, soon a certain money exchange business suddenly came to absorb, and at that time, the sellers decreased, and retail investors followed suit, and in a moment, it rushed out of the 5,500 yuan mark. Silver shops made ten taels each, rising to 5,515 yuan. Later, the surplus was profitable and spit out, once returning to the edge of the 5,500 yuan mark. However, in the end, because a certain gold shop needed to cover the short very much, the high price of 5,530 yuan was seen again, and the closing price was 5,520 yuan. The opening conditions in the afternoon were quite good, jumping 20 yuan, and the gold shop entered the silver shop with twenty taels at 5,540 yuan. Following the progress of gold shops and silver shops, it continued to rise by 35 yuan, and the gold shop entered the silver shop with ten taels, which was 5,575 yuan. Then, a certain silver shop suddenly suppressed the price and sold it forcefully, and gold shops and securities gangs scrambled to sell it. In addition, a certain money exchange business had a large number of bulls come out soon after, and it once forced into the 5,500 yuan mark. Gold shops sold the securities gang ten taels, and the waves were 5,485 yuan. Later, because the people's hearts were still firm, there were many buyers at low prices, and relying on a certain gold shop to transfer the sale into a purchase, and then rose to 5,525 yuan at the closing price. As a result, it rose by 120 yuan compared with the previous day. The whole day was up and down by 145 yuan. The selling price of the current gold of the cash shop was more than ten yuan higher than the silver ingot, and the intake was reduced by 30 yuan. The current standard gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and it was rarely opened.

Jewelry Gold Listed at Ten Yuan

The exchange of jewelry gold per tael in jewelry stores: Initially, Datonghang still suspended 560 yuan. It was not until 11:30 that it was suspended at 10 yuan higher. After that, there was no change. It is estimated that Datonghang changed to suspend 570 yuan. The new line was the same as the above price, and the revenue was reduced by about 30 yuan.

### Silk and Tea　Export Stagnation　Shanghai Silk Market Rises

Recently, the overseas silk market can be described as extremely dull. The spot price in Yokohama is 1,350 yuan, which has remained unchanged for ten days. The forward price has risen slightly, 11 yuan higher than the previous day. The market atmosphere in New York is the same. In the past few days, the daily turnover of the New York Stock Exchange has only been 40% to 50%. In terms of market prices, it showed an increase yesterday. It is estimated that the near-term rose by 3 and a half points, and the far-term rose by 4 and a half points. The foreign firms in Shanghai, the British and French firms, were as silent as ever. A certain foreign firm continued to absorb and purchase. The 6th grade of Qili was sold at 2,525 yuan, which was 50 yuan higher than before. The transaction volume reached nearly 100 dans.

### Grain　Nearly 30,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Newly Arrived　Rice Prices Once Rose and Then Fell Back

A large amount of foreign rice arrived in Shanghai again yesterday. It is estimated that the British ship St. Vincent Depul, managed by the Central Transportation Company, transported 16,251 bags from Saigon. It arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning and docked at Pier 15, Bund, Beijing Road for unloading. It is scheduled to be completed last night. In addition, the Jardine Matheson & Co.'s Laisheng ship transported 6,092 bags from Haiphong and 617 bags from Hong Kong. The Yusheng ship also transported 1,907 bags from Hong Kong. The two ships arrived at the port one after another yesterday morning and docked at the Roosevelt Pier for unloading. The Taikoo & Co.'s Chengdu also arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon and transported 5,018 bags from Hong Kong, docking at the company's pier in the French Concession for unloading. It is estimated that the four ships loaded rice to Shanghai, totaling 29,885 bags. (Zu)

The current foreign rice market seems to have turned to a hovering path. After rising and falling once in the past two days, the rising trend was re-enacted yesterday. Although the buying and selling in the early market still inherited the fatigue of the previous day, the local gangs suddenly took action to select cheap lower-grade goods because of the passport relationship. Once this was active, the sellers immediately followed the wind and turned the rudder. In an instant, the situation became tighter, attracting the general sales who were watching and successively advancing, and thinking about transactions and changing with the opportunity. The wind assisted the waves, and it was actively allowed. Therefore, in the state of constant promotion and agitation by all parties in the market, it felt more concentrated, and the prices of various goods increased in each section in the shouting. As a result, the closing price had risen by 1 to 2 yuan compared with the previous market. It is estimated that the No. 1 Chen Saigon has reached 56 yuan and a half, and the new pointed rice is 55 yuan. However, even so, the actual sales were not greedy, and the local customers did not have a smooth transformation. In addition, the inventory was congested, and the late arrivals were endless, and they did not dare to buy to their heart's content. The market fell by 40 to 50 cents again, and finally it was only half a yuan to one yuan better. At the time when the current rice rose in the early market, the No. 2 Saigon was opened to 59 yuan and a half, but the number of incoming households was not strong, and there were people taking advantage of the high prices to spit it out. The closing price also fell slightly by 20 cents from 59 yuan 34 cents to 59 yuan. The opening price of Siam Siam No. 2 was also 59 yuan and a half, and the closing price also fell back slightly by 20 cents to 59 yuan 30 cents. In short, the market inventory is substantial, there are not many actual sales, and the market will eventually be difficult to recover too much. 200 tons of returned original bags have been opened, and 7,000 bags of current rice have been opened.

The national glutinous rice has been out of stock for a long time, and the inventory is declining, but because foreign glutinous rice has been squeezed out, the foot is relatively soft. Now, after foreign glutinous rice has been sold out repeatedly, the base cargo has also become scarce, and the sales have increased sharply, resulting in an uneven supply and demand situation. Rare things are expensive, so it is extremely tight and valuable, and the price is about 2 yuan higher. Kaijin Litie is 59 yuan, Changdanbai is 567 yuan, Hong Kong is 58 yuan and a half, and Juezhi is 567 yuan.

Although the arrival of thick and thin japonica and other national rice is not always constant, the plate is expensive, and the distance from foreign rice is far away, so it is rumored that there are only some scattered appetites in the off-market transactions, and the selling price is difficult to be as good as foreign rice, which can be called a fixed situation. It is said that everything is similar to the previous plate.

### Japanese Flour Shouts High, Wheat Prices Also Rise

Flour: The factory plate still maintained the original price of 15 yuan yesterday. Local customers had scattered embellishments. The market foot has gradually stabilized. It is found that Japanese factory flour has been devalued repeatedly, which has aroused the attention of the general poor. The price of wheat has been slightly higher in recent days, and the sales have moved slightly. The cargo side shouted up immediately. The August Phoenix brand initially opened at 14 yuan, and then rose to 14 yuan and 20 cents. September has reached 14 yuan and 50 cents, with a transaction of about 3,000 bags. The rising trend in the market is quite strong, and the local flour is also firm with the market. It is heard that the Double Lion brand is also sold for 14 yuan and 50 cents, but there is no formal transaction.

Wheat: Because the production prices in the inland areas of Su and Xi have risen yesterday, the Japanese factory's appetite seems to have become more active, and the cargo side's thinking has become more firm, and it is holding on tightly. The transaction was very rare yesterday, and the market price has risen by 50 to 60 cents. The Chinese factory's price is collected secretly, and 2,000 to 3,000 bags are collected every day. The purchase price is also about half a yuan higher than before.

### Securities　National Debt Sees Both Rise and Fall

The securities noon plate: The market turned slightly weak again yesterday, and trading decreased accordingly. The people's hearts in the market are still very firm, and many parties continue to buy, and have not stopped. For example, No. 20 has always been buying Grade E yesterday, and the demand for Grade A is more common. It has been stipulated that the tenth lottery will be held on the 10th of this month. This lottery is for 28 branches, which is 2 branches more than the last time. The chance of winning the lottery is easier. Although the cost is higher, the rights are naturally more. For example, Songmao, Yongkang, Hengfu, and the general retail investors are particularly interested in Grade A. Those who bought large amounts before have never been seen to sell them. There may be an abnormal development in the future. The sellers in the market include Xinchang, Hongda, Lianyi, Tongkang, and Zhongxin, who have all sold out. However, the buyers are not weak, so as a result, Grade B is still 5 points better, and the rest are consistently reduced by 5 points, 10 cents to 25 cents. The total transaction volume was more than 800,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.

Stock trading: 100 shares of Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company were traded at a price of 11 yuan and 30 cents.

Although the trading volume of the Public Chamber of Commerce this week is small, the surplus settlement in the last five minutes is still unavoidable. However, the absorption power of many parties is very strong, and the market conditions at the closing price are extremely strong. Rubber stocks are the most prominent. Yingzhahua and Langgezhi have made progress. The closing price of the former is 35 yuan 25, and the latter is 25 yuan 25. The Yihua stock has been in good demand all day, and the transaction volume of the British Associated stock is also huge.

London, 1st (Thursday) telegram: Today's board of foreign debt and Far East British companies' stocks are listed. Bank stocks are tending to fall. It is estimated that the stock of McCallum Bank has fallen back by 1 shilling and 3 pence, and the price is 6 pounds 18 shillings and 9 pence. The stocks of HSBC have fallen by 2 pounds each. The stock registered in London is 63 pounds, and the stock registered in Hong Kong is 66 pounds. The stock of Gulake Linbang Rubber is the only one that has risen by 1 shilling and 3 pence, and the price is 15 shillings. The rest are unchanged.

### Yarn and Cotton　Double Horse Yarn Once Breaks the Thousand Yuan Mark

The yarn market is tending to be firm, and the rising trend has risen slightly. This is because the Ministry of Finance announced the new exchange rate of legal tender against the British pound to be 4 and a half pence. The people's hearts were temporarily agitated, and the buying sentiment was strong. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn rose above the 1,000 yuan mark. Unexpectedly, the actual transaction was still bleak and lifeless. At the same time, a certain long side suddenly came out in secret when the rising trend was on. As a result, the table was relaxed, and the market fell back again.

The spot yarn opened in the morning, and the investment and buying sentiment was active due to the tightening of the market and the high price of gold. The opening price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 1,000 yuan, an increase of 20 yuan. The atmosphere was enthusiastic for a while, and the shouting was as chaotic as hemp, making it to 1,008 yuan. Unexpectedly, the long side of the big account came out in large quantities. At the same time, the bill of exchange was slightly weak. At this point, the chips fell off, and the market price fell back to 990 yuan quickly. The closing price rebounded slightly. According to the half-day transaction statistics, 1,800 packages were traded. The market price of 20-count Double Horse yarn increased by 14 yuan. Today, 1,835 pieces of cotton yarn were transported to Hong Kong. The amount of purchases by each gang is listed below:

Colleagues 1,435 Hong Kong 265

Tianjin 1001 Statistics 1800

### Cotton Mills Need to Be Continuous

Although there are no wholesale developments in the spot cotton trade, the mills still need to be continuous in small amounts. In addition, the foreign exchange has been reduced, which has improved the people's hearts, so the market is firmer. The transaction situation of spot cotton is listed on the left:

Dazhonghua 207.00 Hongzhang entered 133 pieces

Brazilian cotton 226.00 Shener Mill entered 300 pieces

Huocaobao 151.00 Xieshen entered 155 packages

Dazhongji 202.00 Chengde entered 133 packages

Another news about the market price of foreign cotton: the market situation in the New York cotton market is extremely dull, and all parties are holding a wait-and-see attitude. Wall Street is also very quiet. As a result, the closing price fell by 23 pounds compared with the previous day. The Indian cotton market was closed yesterday, and the forecast was unchanged.

Although the foreign exchange tightened yesterday, the trade of foreign cotton in Shanghai did not stimulate the people's hearts. The cotton yarn was stagnant due to the actual sales, so there was no trade in cotton. The stock in the market is becoming less and less, especially the long fiber is the most. Therefore, the public opinion is that the cotton market will have a turnaround.

### Oil Cake　Soybean Cake Falls Back Slightly

Oil cake has not been much changed this week due to the lack of new stimulus. However, soybean cake was once strong, but the road to go was not wide, so the potential is still less amazing, and the market has been slightly reduced yesterday, only 700 pieces of Shenji cake were opened, the price was 11 yuan 10 cents, and one car of Yuanlong cake, the price was 10 yuan 70 cents. The price of raw soybean oil rose and fell each other, and the range was also ordinary, so the overall situation was no different from lingering.

### Piece Goods　Cloth Mills Prepare to Resume Work

Recently, the cloth market has been dominated by customer sales and activity of hoarders. Due to the general shutdown and reduction of work in cloth mills, the mill's inventory is gradually thinning. Many mills are actively preparing to resume work. The cost of new goods will increase due to the rise in the price of raw yarn, so the market is showing a turnaround. Yesterday's white goods selling plate increased by 25 cents to 50 cents per piece, and the bleached and dyed cloths also increased by about 50 cents. The local printing and dyeing factory has a sharp increase in the need for various grey cloths. The wholesale number slightly handled about 600 pieces of coarse cloth and bleached and dyed cloth. The Fujian gang handled more than 300 pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, and thread flannel. The Guangdong and Hong Kong gangs handled 200 pieces of twill and colored cloth.

The closing price of 12-pound Longtou fine cloth is 30 yuan 07 and a half cents, and the closing price of Four Gentlemen serge is 91 cents per yard. The Tianjin gang purchased more than 300 pieces of fine cloth, and the local industry is very firm and the amount of advance is very large.

### Autumn and Winter Woolen Fabrics Are Still Firm

The market conditions of woolen fabrics are still weak. The trend of various goods for autumn and winter sales, such as horse riding breeches, Tosca velvet, single-sided floral velvet, pullover floral velvet, Melton, plain thick velvet, shoe velvet, Zhan velvet, wide and tight camel velvet, long-haired velvet, short-haired velvet, Harris, men's and women's colored coats, etc., is stable, but the transaction is far less than the first half of the month. This is because the selling price is high, and the prices of various goods continue to decline.

### Sugar Market　Ersi Coarse White　Guangdong Gang Continues to Advance More Than 1,000 Packages

Yesterday's sugar market: Because the new exchange rate was announced, the British and American exchange rates were reduced, and the people's hearts turned better.

### Seafood　Squid Rises Step by Step

Since the coastal areas of Zhejiang and Fujian were blockaded by a certain party, the source of squid and jellyfish produced in Ningbo has been cut off, so the market price has been rising continuously. For example, jellyfish skin has risen to 60 yuan, and the stock is about to be sold out. The price of jellyfish head is 50 yuan, and the price of Ningbo squid is 80 yuan. The market goods have been collected. The price of local goods has risen by 20 to 30 yards and has been sold for more than 145 yuan. It was quoted at 150 yuan yesterday.

### Coal　Tongdeli Lump Soars

Tongdeli white coal had been falling step by step in the black market last week due to the large number of sales by owners. Recently, the sales in this street have gradually shown a turnaround. Street customers intend to collect them, and the cargo owners refuse to sell them, temporarily watching and waiting. The spot goods in the market suddenly feel scarce, and the market plate immediately soars. It is estimated that the Tongdeli screened lump is 180 yuan per ton, and the unified coal is 170 yuan, delivered to the customer's home, including the handling.

### Medicinal Materials　Coix Seed Has Lively Demand

Coix seed has a sweet taste and is a product for removing dampness in summer, so the sales at this time are quite lively, and it is best to have a white color and no moths. It is found that there are mostly middle and secondary grades in the market. At present, the upper and middle grades are sold for 70 yuan, and the decision is 65 yuan 60 yuan.

### Three Cases of Violence Occurred at the Same Time Yesterday Morning: White Russian Leader Metzler Was Brutally Murdered; Shen Jinzhou, Manager of Yitaixing, Was Kidnapped; Failed Kidnapping on Huanlong Road, Patrol Was Shot

Cases of kidnapping and assassination in this city have emerged one after another. Yesterday, the consular corps was holding a meeting to curb political violence. Unexpectedly, at 8:20 yesterday morning, a case of a gangster shooting and killing Mr. Charles Metzler, chairman of the White Russian community in Shanghai and a famous White Russian leader in the Far East, occurred at 208 Fuyang Road. He was injured and died in the car. At around 8:50 AM on the same morning, a kidnapping case occurred at the corner of Avenyi Road and Wenzhou Road. The kidnapped person was Shen Jinzhou, manager of Yitaixing Coal Ball Shop. In addition, at around 8:00 AM yesterday morning, a resident on Huanlong Road was about to board a car to go out to do errands. He was threatened by gangsters waiting there. Fortunately, he escaped by being alert, but the guard at the post was shot and injured. It is found that the above three cases almost occurred at the same time. The details of each case are described as follows:

### Bloodshed on Nanyang Road: White Russian Leader Assassinated

Charles Metzler, Chairman of the White Russian Emigrant Committee in Shanghai and a prominent White Russian leader in the Far East, was shot dead yesterday morning at 8:20 AM. He was leaving his private residence at 208 Nanyang Road, Apartment 17 on the second floor of the Avenue Apartments. As he stepped outside and entered his private car (license plate number 4811), driven by Zhou Zhengui (from Shaoxing), his chauffeur of 16 years, who was just about to start the engine:

Entering the Car, He Was Immediately Attacked

Suddenly, a Xiang Sheng taxi (license plate number 17972) pulled up in front. A thug dressed in white silk clothing jumped out of the taxi, pulled out a pistol, and fired two shots directly at Metzler in the car. The chauffeur, Zhou Zhengui, panicked and fled the scene. Returning shortly thereafter, he saw the assailant jump back into the taxi, which was about to drive away. Zhou immediately followed in his car, chasing it to the intersection of Xiaoshadu Road. Suddenly, several more thugs appeared on the side of the road, threatening Zhou Zhengui with pistols and forcing him to drive back to the original location.

A Likeness of Mr. Metzler

Two Bullets to the Chest, Instant Death

The assailant fired two more shots at Metzler, then they all fled. As a result, Metzler took two bullets to the left chest, bleeding profusely and barely breathing. A foreign national who witnessed the horrific event at the scene immediately urged the chauffeur to drive his master to Hong En Hospital on Avenue Haig for treatment. However, Metzler died en route. His body has been moved to the International Funeral Parlor. According to a foreign national who lived in the same apartment building as Metzler, there appeared to be four thugs in the Xiang Sheng taxi, but only one directly committed the act.

The Local Russian Community Deeply Shocked and Angered

After the assassination, the entire Russian community in Shanghai was deeply shocked and angered, as Metzler had contributed significantly to the welfare of the Russian community during his lifetime. Before his death, Metzler had maintained close contact with Japanese consular officials and was known to be pro-Japanese. Two weeks prior, he had visited Japanese Consul-General Miura Yoshiaki to discuss the status of the Russian community in Shanghai. The Consul-General reportedly promised to support Metzler's re-election as Chairman of the Russian Emigrant Committee. One month ago, the puppet mayor, Chuan Xiaoan, had also given Metzler the same assurance. It is believed that after this tragic incident, the Russian community in Shanghai will show even greater indifference towards the new Russian organizations sponsored by the Japanese.

Telegram Urges Metzler's Wife to Return to Shanghai for Funeral

Reporters visited Metzler's private residence, which was richly furnished. Metzler's sister-in-law and several servants remained in the house. They revealed that Metzler's wife had gone to Japan four days earlier to escape the summer heat and recuperate from an illness. She has been notified by telegram and urged to return to Shanghai by plane to arrange her husband's funeral. Metzler was 52 years old and had lived in Shanghai for nearly 25 years. He majored in law at the University of Saint Petersburg and later studied at the Imperial Russian Oriental Languages Institute. In 1908, he was appointed Deputy Consul of the Imperial Russian Consulate in Mongolia. In 1912, he was promoted to Secretary of the Imperial Russian Embassy in Beijing, and soon after, he was assigned to Shanghai as a Consul. After the closure of the Imperial Russian Consulate in Shanghai in 1923, Metzler worked at the Danish Insurance Company for eight years. He then became a senior executive at the American Manufacturers Foreign Credit Insurance Association.

### Manager of Yi Tai Xing Coal Company, Shen Jinzhou, Kidnapped

A kidnapping occurred yesterday morning around 8:50 AM at the corner of Rue A.M. Dollfus and Wenzhou Road. The victim was Shen Jinzhou, a native of Yuyao and the manager of the major coal company Yi Tai Xing Coal Company in Shanghai. Four bandits jumped into Shen's private car, number 5186, and sped westwards. Around 11:00 AM, the company's car was found at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Rue Chu Pao San. Details of the incident are as follows:

Traveling by Car

Shen Jinzhou, 53, from Yuyao, Zhejiang Province, resides alone at No. 3, Lane 239, Pinghe Lane, Avenue A.M. Dollfus. Shen is a shareholder and manager of Yi Tai Xing Coal Company at 184 Xinzha Road and also serves as an executive director of the Zhonghua Coal Ball Company. He owns a Ford car, number 5186, for transportation and employs Gu Amao, a 34-year-old chauffeur from Nantong, who has been working for him for more than a year.

Suddenly Kidnapped

Yesterday morning at 8:50 AM, Shen, as usual, got into his car to go to the Yi Tai Xing Coal Company at 184 Xinzha Road and then to inspect the factory at 352 McTaggart Road. However, as the car turned east from Pinghe Lane onto the corner of Avenue A.M. Dollfus and Wenzhou Road, four bandits, who were lying in wait, blocked the car. Two of them, one wearing a white Zhongshan suit and the other a paletot, each pulled out a pistol and stopped the car from moving forward, threatening and intimidating the occupants. They opened the car door, and the bandits swarmed in. Two bandits entered the passenger compartment, holding the victim hostage with guns in hand, preventing him from moving. The other two bandits stepped into the front, guarding the chauffeur Gu Amao.

Car Found

They ordered him to drive south, heading west on Jing'an Temple Road until the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Chengdu Road, where they forced Amao out of the car. One of the bandits then drove the car further west, disappearing without a trace. Afterwards, Amao returned to his residence to report the kidnapping to the family and reported the incident to the Xinzha police station for rescue and investigation. Upon receiving the report, the police dispatched detectives to investigate the scene and brought the chauffeur Gu Amao to the police station to interrogate him about the kidnapping. They also searched for the kidnappers to bring them to justice. Around 1:00 PM in the afternoon, Shen's car was found at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Rue Chu Pao San and was taken back to the police station, ordering the Shen family to take the car. When Shen was kidnapped yesterday morning, he was wearing a white silk long gown and silk trousers, a straw hat, and cloth-soled satin shoes.

### Attempted Kidnapping on Route Cardinal Mercier

Yesterday morning around 8:00 AM, a resident of a house on Route Cardinal Mercier had just left his doorway and was about to step into his private car when four thugs suddenly threatened him, intending to kidnap him. Upon seeing this, the servants rushed forward to stop them. One of the thugs tried to pull out a gun and fire, but the gun jammed and failed to discharge. The resident, upon seeing this, became overly frightened and fainted to the ground. At that time, other pedestrians passed by and ran to inform Hua Bu No. 1057, stationed at the intersection of Route Cardinal Mercier and Route Hua Long. The policeman hesitated and retorted to the pedestrian, "How do you know they have guns?" Before he finished speaking, the thugs heard the commotion and fired at the policeman with a pistol, hitting him in the back. The thugs then fled in a panic, leaving behind a pistol. The injured policeman was immediately taken to the French police hospital. His condition is stable. The French police are continuing to investigate the case. Whether the incident is politically motivated remains to be determined.

### British Ambassador Cables Safe Arrival in Weihaiwei

Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the British Ambassador, quietly left Shanghai on the Tai Koo Shipping Company's Hunan on the 30th of last month. A cable received yesterday announced his safe arrival in Weihaiwei, where he met with the Ambassador's wife. Ambassador Kerr's trip is a one-week vacation. His stay there is purely a private trip and does not involve any official business.

### Consular Body Held Meeting Yesterday, Issued Important Resolutions, Sent Letter to Shanghai Municipal Council with Several Suggestions, Urging Close Cooperation Among Foreign Defense Forces

Due to the rampant terrorist activities in the International Settlement, Mr. Stirling Fessenden, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, made an earnest appeal to the Consular Body on the 22nd of last month, requesting cooperation to curb these activities. Subsequently, Mr. Herbert Phillips, the Doyen of the Consular Body, convened a meeting of the Consular Body to discuss the matter. However, due to the Japanese Consul-General Miura's shifting of the blame to the Chinese government, the meeting did not reach a definitive decision. It was decided to reconvene the Consular Body meeting yesterday to continue the discussion.

Strict Security

Yesterday afternoon at 3:30 PM, the meeting was held in the Shanghai Municipal Council's conference room. Due to the importance of the meeting, security was tight, and reporters were denied access. Only consuls from various countries were allowed to attend. The meeting was held in secret for two and a half hours, and the contents remained confidential.

Resolutions Issued

However, after the discussion, the following resolutions were issued: "The Shanghai Consular Body considers all acts of terrorism to be contrary to the principles of humanity and civilization. In view of the tragic impact of such acts in Shanghai, this body strongly condemns terrorism in any form or by anyone. Given the actual situation in Shanghai, the body urges the Shanghai Municipal Council to fully consider the situation here and to make every effort to suppress and prevent all acts of terrorism in order to maintain peace and order."

Preparing a Reply

According to the Doyen of the Consular Body, Mr. Herbert Phillips, the Consular Body has already sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council with several suggestions, urging the Shanghai Municipal Police and the foreign defense forces stationed in Shanghai to cooperate. However, before the meeting, when reporters interviewed Japanese Consul-General Miura, Miura maintained his view that the terrorist incidents in the International Settlement were entirely caused by so-called Chongqing elements. Miura used this excuse to pressure the Consular Body meeting.

### Shanghai Postmaster Jappelyn Returned to Shanghai Yesterday Morning, Discussed with Japanese Officials Regarding Mail Inspection in the French Concession

Mr. Jappelyn, the French postmaster of the Shanghai Postal Administration, left Shanghai on the 16th of last month, traveling via Hong Kong to Yunnan. Because Mr. Guo Xinsong, the Director-General of the Postal Administration, was in Chongqing on official business, Jappelyn then traveled from Yunnan to Chongqing to report on the situation of the four postal districts of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi. He also provided detailed information on the general postal affairs in Shanghai. Due to the urgent need to handle official duties in Shanghai, he traveled via the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, arriving in Hong Kong and taking the Jardine Matheson & Co.'s Yuesheng to Shanghai. Mr. Jappelyn arrived in Shanghai at 7:13 AM yesterday morning and returned to his residence to rest. After 2:00 PM, he returned to the Postal Administration for an informal meeting with Mr. Kanaji Kin-ichiro to discuss concrete measures for inspecting mail in the French Concession.

Mail Inspection Situation

Reporters from the Xin Sheng News Agency learned from the Post Office on Route Masnan that the branch office had already prepared the record book for recording suspicious mail to be detained by Japanese inspectors. It was reported that formal inspection had indeed begun, but no mail had been detained yet. All preparatory procedures had been completed. Mr. Huang Kuanhua, head of the administration section of the branch, also reported this. The branch office also frankly admitted that gradual inspection would likely begin in the future. Yesterday, the inspectors did not go to the Post Office on Route Masnan due to a temporary notice from Director Kanaji, reportedly due to the arrival of Postmaster Jappelyn in Shanghai.

### Iron Gates of Nanshi Fully Opened, Rumors Swirl Again, Claiming Shanghai West End Gambling Dens and Brothels Moving to Nanshi Simultaneously

Yesterday, rumors spread that the iron gates adjacent to Nanshi, which have been closed for a long time, would be fully opened on the 6th of this month. There were also rumors that, due to the above reasons, gambling dens and brothels on the Shanghai West End and in Caojiadu would simultaneously move to Nanshi to operate. They allegedly have obtained joint permission from the puppet detective team, the "self-defense force," the "police bureau," and the Japanese military police and special forces. This is because the International Settlement authorities have tightened security in the West End, causing business in the gambling dens to decline, so they have long sought other locations. However, there have been many obstacles in Nanshi, so it has not yet been realized. Reporters from the Dagang News Agency inquired about this matter from various parties yesterday but could not confirm it. However, the houses in Yanhai Lane and other places have been completely rented out, reportedly for use as gambling dens and brothels. This, combined with the proliferation of open-air gambling dens in the alleys of Nanshi, makes the rumor of gambling dens moving to Nanshi difficult to dismiss.

### Ni Lanshen Kidnapped Last Night

Ni Lanshen, an editor at the Xinwen Daily, was kidnapped last night at 11 PM. As he entered Shenyu Lane on Route Hua Cheng in the French Concession, where he lived, two men in Western suits suddenly rushed out from behind, grabbed Mr. Ni on both sides, and dragged him out of the lane, forcing him into a black-plated car with license plate number 3459, which was parked at the entrance of the lane. The car sped away. At the time, Mrs. Ni was preparing medicine because Mr. Ni had been feeling slightly unwell. It was only when onlookers in the lane reported what they had witnessed that she realized what had happened. She immediately reported the incident to the police station and requested an investigation.

### Yixing Association Raising Funds for Drought Relief

Yixing is located at the junction of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces. Mountains account for most of its area. It is prone to disasters when it encounters drought. Since the beginning of summer this year, there has been little rain, and the fields in various villages cannot be planted with rice. The drought is severe, and coupled with the ongoing war, the disaster victims are displaced, and starvation is rampant. The Yixing Association in Shanghai, recognizing the many difficulties in its hometown, convened the 7th Joint Meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees the day before yesterday to discuss drought relief matters. In addition to requesting emergency relief from charitable organizations, it plans to allocate a large sum of money to relieve the disaster victims in its county.

### Ministry of Finance Revised Commercial Exchange Rate, British Exchange at Four and a Half Pence, Supported by Both Chinese and Foreign Parties

After the Ministry of Finance strengthened foreign exchange management, it allowed exporters of foreign exchange settlement goods to receive foreign exchange differences and supplied as much foreign exchange as possible for the import of essential goods. Now, in order to encourage the export of domestic goods and restrict the import of non-essential goods, it ordered that the "commercial exchange rate" of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications be adjusted from the old rate of seven pence to four and a half pence. In addition to notifying the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Trade Commission, it also telegraphed the silver and money industry associations to comply. The legal exchange rate of the fiat currency against the British exchange rate remains unchanged at one shilling and two and a half pence. Outsiders, unaware of this, thought that the fiat currency had depreciated, which is a misunderstanding of the central government's intention to support exporters and restrict the import of non-essential goods.

Beneficial to Both Importers and Exporters

The Bank of China and the Bank of Communications' commercial exchange rate has been adjusted to four and a half pence per British exchange rate since August 1st. Reporters from the Xin Sheng News Agency learned from banking circles yesterday that (1) for the export of domestic goods, for tung oil, bristles, tea, and minerals that are purchased, transported, and sold under the overall planning of the government, as well as for egg products, feathers, casings, leather, seeds, tobacco, wood, ramie, furs, kudzu, medicinal materials, oil wax, and cotton products that are settled in foreign exchange, exporters can receive the difference between the legal price and the price listed by the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications upon presentation of settlement documents after the actual settlement of the foreign exchange amount. The intention is to allow exporters to receive this foreign exchange difference to subsidize transportation losses, thereby encouraging their exports, and to obtain benefits equivalent to the black market fiat exchange rate. In this way, foreign exchange evasion can be reduced, and the effect of collecting Chinese and foreign exchange can be achieved.

Applying for Fiat Exchange Requires Payment of Balancing Fee

(2) For the import of foreign goods, if the imported goods of the importer are not subject to import bans and are necessary for the country, they may apply to the Foreign Exchange Examination Committee for the purchase of foreign exchange. However, the applicant must pay a balancing fee based on the difference between the legal price and the price listed by the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications. The significance is as follows: Since the import of non-essential and luxury goods has already been prohibited, the import of essential goods should be supplied as much as possible to reduce the burden on the people caused by the shrinking foreign exchange market and the increase in prices. In the past, all imported goods, whether essential, non-essential, or luxury goods, were given foreign exchange based on the ability to show standard verification, which led to competition for foreign exchange in the black market, causing the black market exchange rate to become increasingly scarce. Now that essential goods are supplied with foreign exchange, and non-essential and luxury goods are prohibited from import, it is hoped that the black market exchange rate will be more stable.

Legal Exchange Rate Remains Unchanged

Regarding the legal foreign exchange rate, it has remained unchanged since the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Management Committee made every effort to stabilize it. The Central Bank's legal foreign exchange listing price is one shilling and two and a half pence for British exchange and thirty yuan for US exchange. The expenses for banks to handle foreign exchange settlement have now been changed to be borne by the government. The original regulations that merchants should pay a handling fee within the limit of 3% of the difference between the legal foreign exchange price and the bank's listed price when applying for the legal foreign exchange price from the bank have been waived. In the past, when merchants settled foreign exchange with banks, they settled at 90% of the actual sales amount filled in the actual sales price certificate, but now it has been changed to 80%. For goods transferred from the southwestern provinces that require a lot of foreign currency expenses through foreign ports, it can be reduced to 70% to allow exporters to export large quantities of goods, thereby increasing foreign exchange income and balancing international payments.

Making It Almost the Same as the Black Market

Reporters from the Xin Sheng News Agency further learned from foreign banks yesterday that Shanghai's black market foreign exchange rates were previously caused by the Chinese government's restriction on the supply of legal foreign exchange, so that those who could not apply for legal foreign exchange had to purchase foreign exchange in the black market. At the same time, speculators deliberately manipulated the market, causing the black market exchange rate to fluctuate sharply, and legitimate merchants suffered greatly. The "commercial exchange rate" of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications listed at seven pence for British exchange and thirteen yuan and six hundred and twenty-five yuan for US exchange. The Central Bank's legal exchange rate listed at one shilling and two pence and a half for British exchange and thirty yuan for US exchange, but the difference from the Shanghai black market exchange rate was still large, so it was actually necessary to lower the "commercial exchange rate" so that the black market could be stable for a long time. Now that the Chinese government has suppressed the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications' listing to be almost the same as the black market, the black market will not have any drastic changes in the future.

Financial Markets Unanimously Support It

Foreign businessmen have expressed support for the government's measures. The source of foreign exchange for the fiat currency will increase as exporters will receive more income after the exchange rate is revised. They will voluntarily sell their foreign exchange bills to the government, and the entire source of foreign exchange will naturally become more abundant. The news of this revised exchange rate was already known to well-informed parties in Shanghai. However, because it was understood that this change was purely a technical effect of adjusting the foreign exchange market, the entire foreign exchange market was not affected in any way. After the news was announced yesterday, the market briefly reacted. The US exchange rate briefly shrank to five yuan and eight hundred and twelve yuan, and gold rose to five thousand five hundred yuan. However, the overall situation was very stable. As for the stock market, it went through a very calm period.

### Dutch Royal Ships Suspended, Hong Kong and Burma Flying Started, Provisionally Scheduled to Fly Once Every Saturday, Haiphong Freight Transport Stalled

Since the outbreak of the Second World War in Europe, the Mediterranean has been closed, which has not only caused major obstacles to European shipping but has also changed the routes and kept the schedules secret for the ships traveling on the Europe-Asia route. Therefore, Chinese newspapers in this city have rarely disclosed the schedules of ships with the nationality of the belligerent countries. As for French and Italian commercial ships, they have been suspended. The Italian ship Conte Verde is still anchored at buoys 16 and 17 in the Huangpu River, and there is no schedule to resume sailing. The Java route from Shanghai to Batavia, Macassar, Samarang, and Surabaya in the Dutch East Indies is exclusively operated by the Java Mail Ship Company in this city, with more than ten ships with the "Zhi" character. The Netherlands has also been thrown into the vortex of the European war, and the schedules of the company's ships are also kept secret.

Dutch Royal Ships

Suddenly Announced Suspension

In addition, the Dutch Royal Company, which operates in East Africa, has three ships, such as the Boisgevain, the Ruys, and the Tegclberg, all of which are equal in size, about 15,000 tons. Originally, they sailed to various ports in Hong Kong, the South Seas Islands, and East Africa. Later, from 1938, they began to come to Shanghai and Taiwan, managed by the Java Mail Ship Company. Since these three ships have been operating in Shanghai, the company has recently heard that due to the current situation, it will temporarily suspend the three ships. Since then, there will be no direct shipping lines from this city to East Africa.

Haiphong Freight Transport

Completely Stalled

As for the port of Haiphong in Vietnam, since the fall of Guangzhou in South China, the port has suddenly become a passage connecting the interior, and commerce has gradually prospered. Unexpectedly, it has recently been oppressed by the Japanese, and transportation has been invisibly stalled. Although the British companies Taikoo and Jardine Matheson in this city continue to maintain the Shanghai-Fangcheng line, the outgoing goods have disappeared, and only foreign rice is arriving.

Hong Kong and Burma Aviation

Trial Flight Good

It is also heard that the Hong Kong-Hanoi air route operated by the French airline Air France has been flying once a week from Hong Kong to Hanoi every Thursday. Recently, due to certain reasons, it has suddenly been suspended. It is difficult to predict when it will resume. In addition, the Hong Kong-Rangoon (Burma) air route trial-operated by the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) was trial-flown on the 20th of last month with excellent results. It is heard that there will be a stopover in Kunming or Chongqing. The location must be temporarily determined. The flight schedule is tentatively set for once every Saturday. The fare is 654 rupees per person in Burmese currency. This makes it much more convenient between Hong Kong and Burma.

### Japanese Warship Sailed to Zhenhai Yesterday; Three Gunboats Fully Loaded with Munitions and Provisions; Japanese Warships Indiscriminately Opened Fire on Zhenhai Waters

Three Japanese gunboats, fully loaded with munitions and provisions from the Japanese military supply depot in Wusong, set sail from Wusong around 3 p.m. yesterday, heading to Zhenhai for combat. Each ship also carried marines and rubber dinghies, suggesting an intention to land.

Zhenhai War Report

The Ningbo sojourner groups in Shanghai continued to receive telegrams from Ningbo yesterday, stating that around 5 a.m. on the 31st, two Japanese warships of various sizes were spotted patrolling the waters off Yushan, outside Zhenhai. Ten minutes later, one of the Japanese warships suddenly opened fire on our fortress, firing over thirty shots before ceasing. An hour later, the two Japanese warships sailed north. At 8:40 a.m., clear cannon fire was heard in Ningbo, seemingly coming from Zhenhai. The source of the fire has not yet been officially announced. Furthermore, at 8:31 a.m. on the same day, heavy engine sounds were heard northeast of Longshan for about twenty minutes before gradually subsiding. Two Japanese warships in the Qijiao waters of Xiangshan Port sailed towards Tingshuimen around 6 a.m. yesterday. Additionally, one Japanese warship each was anchored off Huangniu Reef and Wushi Mountain. They sailed to the Qijiao waters yesterday and suddenly fired over thirty shots at the coast of Dsong area in eastern Yindong. The shells landed in the mud, causing no damage. The two Japanese warships previously anchored off Zhenhai sailed towards the Qili Ji waters around 9 a.m. on the 1st without any unusual movements. Yesterday, one Japanese warship anchored upstream in the Qiancang waters suddenly opened fire indiscriminately at the coast of Xiangshan Port, firing four or five shots.

Shanghai-Ningbo Transportation

Since the interruption of shipping between Shanghai and Ningbo, travel for passengers has been difficult. Recently, a few passengers from Ningbo arrived in Shanghai by detour. Their routes were as follows: From Ningbo, cross the sea to Lichuang, Yuwang, to Chaiqiao in Zhenhai, cross the sea to Ligang, and take the Ban Hai Yi steamer to Shanghai. From Ningbo to Andong in Yuyao, cross the sea to Zhapu, and then travel to Shanghai. However, these routes are inconvenient and extremely dangerous, so they should not be taken lightly.

### New Gambling Den Opens Next to German School on Avenue Haig; Largest Scale Among Gambling Dens; Gambling Begins Without a License

The English-language *Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury* reported that a gambling den opened last night (the 1st) near the German school on Avenue Haig. Its grandeur and luxurious decoration are unmatched among Shanghai's gambling dens. According to a reporter from someone who visited the gambling den last night, the opening was extremely crowded, with no fewer than two or three thousand people. All kinds of gambling games, such as roulette, were available. It is said that the new gambling den is funded and operated by the owners of various gambling dens forced to close in the Badlands. It is located on Avenue Haig in the Public Concession, with the rear of the building next to the German school. It is reported that it began operating last night without obtaining a license. The various gambling dens in the Badlands are quite worried about the competition from this new gambling den, so the new gambling den may not be able to operate smoothly. According to another source, the gambling den is named "Six Nations Hotel," and the manager is surnamed Zhu.

### Handgun Robbery

At 6:30 a.m. yesterday morning, a case of bandits robbing a public service handgun from a Sikh watchman occurred at the entrance of the Foch Fang alley on Avenue Foch. According to a reporter from the Pingming News Agency, the Sikh watchman was named Chu Zhizhong, 45 years old, from Yancheng. Yesterday morning, while Chu was on duty, a small car suddenly drove from the east on Avenue Foch. Upon reaching the entrance, it stopped abruptly. Three passengers got out of the car and asked Chu for directions. Taking advantage of Chu's unpreparedness, they restrained him. One of the bandits, wearing a Western suit, pulled out a Mauser pistol and warned Chu not to make a sound. Another bandit, wearing Chinese clothing, robbed Chu's official handgun, No. 36688, and six bullets. They then sped away in the original car towards the west. Afterwards, the watchman reported to the police station for investigation.

Within two hours yesterday morning, two car robbery cases occurred in the Shanghai West Badlands. One involved a dispatch car from Yunfei Company (license No. 12339, driver Gui Linsheng, local). The car was summoned to Anhe Temple Road on Avenue de President Doumer at 5:45 a.m. yesterday morning. Unexpectedly, upon arriving at the location, two bandits jumped into the car, intending to seize it for their use. Shortly after, four more people arrived, one of whom was carrying a handgun. They forced the driver out of the car and drove the car away, destination unknown. However, half an hour later, the car was found again at the original location. Another car robbery case occurred at 7:25 a.m. yesterday morning. The car belonged to a certain Chinese merchant's dispatch car company.

### Younger Brother Urged Older Brother to Jump into the Huangpu River

Bai Jinjiang, 40 years old, from Ningbo, lived at a certain address on Kaifeng Road. He used to work as a comprador for the Sanbei Shipping Company and as a chief accountant for the Zhenbei Shipping Company. He became unemployed after the August 13th Incident and has been living idly for several years. He has been experiencing extreme financial difficulties. Recently, with the high cost of living, it has been difficult to support a family of several people. Yesterday morning, Bai went to the Bank of China on the Bund in the French Concession to borrow ten dollars from his younger brother, Bai Jiugao (currently the deputy director of the savings department of the bank). His request was rejected. In the end, he only wanted to borrow one dollar to take a taxi home. Bai Jiugao not only refused but also said to his older brother, "This place is very close to the Huangpu River. You might as well go jump in." Bai Jinjiang was extremely heartbroken upon hearing this. He turned around and went outside, to Pier No. 1 on the Bund, and jumped into the river to commit suicide. Fortunately, a Chinese police officer saw him and managed to pull him out. Because he had swallowed too much water, he was disoriented. An ambulance was called and he was sent to Tongren Hospital. After emergency treatment by the doctor, his life was no longer in danger.

### New Owner of Merchandise Building Forcing Tenants to Vacate; Seventy-Seven Tenants Hope for Protection

The Merchandise Building at No. 110 Avenue Edward VII, also known as the Merchandise Securities Exchange at No. 1 Sichuan Road, was used as a wounded soldier's hospital at the beginning of the August 13th Incident. Later, it became a refugee shelter. The owner, Dehe & Co., later sent staff because some of the refugees had also established transportation companies or factory offices in the building, etc.

Collecting Rent

Those living there paid rent and established an indefinite lease relationship with the owner. At the end of April this year, Dehe & Co. sold the property to Jardine Matheson & Co., a British company. The tenants negotiated their lease rights with Dehe & Co., and the company replied that they should negotiate with the new owner. Jardine Matheson & Co. then notified all tenants that they must

Vacate by the End of July

Currently, there are a total of seventy-seven families living there, with more than a thousand men, women, old and young. At a time when the cost of living is high and it is difficult to find housing, they have nowhere to move. They have repeatedly negotiated with the new owner to continue renting and living there, but to no avail. Around 9 a.m. yesterday morning, Jardine Matheson & Co. sent staff accompanied by several Chinese police officers to the location to force the tenants to move out by cutting off the water supply. The tenants protested

Nearly Resulting in a Conflict

The owner's reason for forcing the tenants to move out was that a portion of the building was burned down in a fire in February of this year, and the entire building needs to be renovated. However, the tenants unanimously believe that there is no need for renovation. During the dispute between the two sides, the police station sent a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives to the scene to mediate. As a result, the water supply was temporarily not cut off, and the burned part was demolished first. The remaining issues will be discussed further by both parties. The tenants' association has appointed lawyer Ge Cheng to advocate for legal protection on their behalf. There may be a satisfactory resolution to this landlord-tenant dispute in the future.

### Detailed Account of the Yu Yuan Road Robbery; Five Bandits Led by a Female Bandit

The *North-China Daily News* reported that the Jing'an Temple police station received a robbery alarm on Yu Yuan Road yesterday afternoon (the 1st) and immediately sent police officers to the scene. Unexpectedly, an incident occurred, and three Chinese police officers from the Public Concession were detained by the Japanese military police for three hours. They were released around 5 p.m. The details are as follows: At 12:20 p.m. yesterday,

Five Bandits

Two of whom were armed, broke into No. 41, Lane 608, Yu Yuan Road to commit robbery. Upon receiving the report, the Jing'an Temple police station immediately dispatched a team of patrol officers led by Chief Inspector Curtis, who sped to the scene. They arrived in just two minutes, surrounded the robbed house, and blocked the streets in front and behind. Then, they drew their guns and approached. They saw one of the robbers acting as a lookout at the back door and ordered him to stop. However, the robber was alert and scattered

Climbing on the Roof

And fled before the patrol officers entered the house. One of the robbers jumped over the back wall and escaped. To avoid misidentifying others, the patrol officers did not open fire but carefully observed. When the robbers re-entered various houses in the lane, they began searching house by house. The residents were obviously frightened and did not provide assistance. However, the patrol officers continued their search and finally found a person at No. 47 who claimed to be a cook. This aroused the suspicion of patrol officer Tagliaferro. Tagliaferro withdrew and

Informed the Patrol Chief

Wright, and after asking Wright to strengthen precautions, he re-entered No. 47. Then, one of the residents pointed to the washroom and whispered to Tagliaferro, "Robber." Tagliaferro entered the room and arrested the bandit posing as a cook. Just as he was about to interrogate him, around 1 p.m., some "municipal police" arrived at the scene. After learning the situation, they questioned him together with the Public Concession patrol officers. Tagliaferro handed over the arrested person to the "municipal police" and continued

To Carry Out the Search

At 1:30 p.m., suddenly a company of Japanese military police, led by Captain Shida, marched into the street in formation. Shida immediately asked Wright, "What authority do Public Concession patrol officers have to operate in the outer-road area?" Wright replied that the Jing'an Temple police station had dispatched patrol officers after receiving a report from a foreigner. However, the Japanese continued to object. Wright then handed over one of the arrested bandits and a large number of stolen goods to the Japanese military police. However, Shida's attitude

Remained Stubborn

And ordered the Japanese military police to arrest three Chinese patrol officers from the Jing'an Temple police station before allowing the remaining patrol officers to withdraw. Soon after, the Japanese military police and the "municipal police" conducted a perfunctory investigation and left the scene together. Although one of the bandits was arrested, the remaining four bandits were likely still hiding in the houses along the street. When the Public Concession patrol officers were at the scene, Chinese men were not allowed to enter or leave the houses in the lane. Among the stolen items recovered at the time, there was at least one discarded piece of clothing. The street is usually sparsely populated, and the robbery was

Carefully Planned

The Jing'an Temple police station received a report from a foreign employee of the *North-China Daily News* and quickly dispatched officers to surround and arrest them, which stopped the robbery. When the robbery occurred, it was led by a woman. The woman was familiar with the habits of the residents of No. 41 and the names of the maids. She led the bandits to call the maid to open the door, preventing her from making a sound, and then entered the house, driving the residents into a room. Then, they used a gun to force the homeowner's son to lead them to the room where a large amount of cash was stored. Just as the lookout saw the patrol officers arriving, he shouted a warning, and the bandits scattered and fled.

Learning Western Languages

The Zuo Zhuan says, "Enjoy local customs and do not forget the old." Although Chu was considered a Yi-Di (barbarian tribe) during the Spring and Autumn period, it was actually within the Huaxia (Chinese) civilization. Yet, even in interactions, not forgetting the local accent was praised as gentlemanly. Now, diligently learning the languages and writing of overseas countries, isn't this different from what Zhong Yi did? However, clinging to the past in the present is not the view of an enlightened person. Recently, with increasing trade between China and foreign countries, navigating the seas and climbing mountains, there is no place unreached. What used to be translated through multiple intermediaries is now as simple as asking someone at the door. If we cannot understand their languages and learn their writing, how can we connect the emotions of China and foreign countries and understand the nature of both Chinese and Westerners? This is why studying Western words and languages is something we dare not delay. Those with foresight fear that the teachings of one Qi person cannot match the clamor of a crowd of Chu people. They propose sending young children abroad to focus on learning, planning for their secure future, and also allowing them to become familiar with local customs to become useful talents and store them for future use. This method can be said to be thorough, and the intention can be said to be beautiful. However, Chinese people often spoil their children. Wealthy families are unwilling to let their children go abroad. Therefore, those sent are mostly sons or younger brothers from poor families. Once they go abroad, their horizons broaden. This is like living in a cave for a long time and suddenly arriving in the countryside, where the world seems different. Furthermore, being far from China, they may not understand the influence of etiquette and righteousness. Therefore, management and education must be handled with great care.

### Rooster – In Memory of Lu Xun's Sixtieth Birthday

— Xu Yi

Today is the sixtieth anniversary of Lu Xun's birth. As we gaze remotely at the tomb of the teacher, deeply embedded in a demonic atmosphere, do we weep? Do we sigh? Or do we raise high lanterns to celebrate the "posthumous birthday" of our giant?

Sixty years ago today, just as a wicked devil's hand was gripping our country, in a remote corner, a majestic "rooster" was born. That was our mentor, Lu Xun.

Lu Xun was a "rooster." He stood among hundreds of millions of "lazy pigs," awakening them from their slumber every morning. However, the "rooster" finally died from overwork. Will our "lazy pigs" fall into a deep sleep because they no longer hear the rooster's crow?

Ironclad facts tell us: The "lazy pigs," due to the "rooster's" decades of crowing and the lessons of reality, have become accustomed to knowing when to wake up and when to work! They no longer indulge in gluttony and laziness, nor do they fall into a deep sleep. They have transformed into a group of loyal oxen, no, they have transformed into a group of brave roaring lions!

But how should we commemorate this deceased "rooster"? We will never weep, never sigh, but we also know that this is not the time to celebrate with lanterns and decorations. What we must do is learn his spirit of hard work!

"We must dare to laugh, dare to cry, dare to be angry, dare to scold, dare to fight, and in this cursed place, repel that cursed era!"

Family

### The English Family

— Jiang Yi, sent from London

In an English family, it is common to find only a husband and wife or one or two children. The goal of the English is to enable everyone to build a family for themselves. According to English law, both men and women are considered adults at the age of twenty-one, free to leave their parents and be independent.

Many wealthy English people have at least two houses: one in the countryside and one in the city. But even middle-class families may have a country residence or a seaside cabin in addition to their original home, for weekend and holiday relaxation.

The English are very particular about the architecture of houses and interior decoration and furnishings. Some periodicals are devoted to discussing these issues. Many houses built several eras ago still exist. Their architectural style is based on the royal title of that era. For example, the Victorian era, the Georgian era, the Anne era, the Tudor era, and so on. These types of houses mostly belong to famous aristocratic families. They are very proud of preserving the old architecture and like to talk about the historical value of their houses, thus becoming common conversation topics at their tea parties and banquets.

The owners of such houses often hire a large number of servants. For example, managers, assistants, housekeepers, parlor maids, bedroom maids, cooks, and mansion maids. Although only a few masters live in that large house, all the servants are very busy. In order to preserve the house in its best form, the walls must have decorations from the same era as the house, and the furniture must be matched with the style of the same era. An English friend of mine has a Tudor-era house in the mountains of northern England. I am often invited to stay in that house for a week or two. There are many places there that I find very interesting. The stairs are made of stone. Because they are five or six hundred years old, they have become slippery. People going up and down always have to grab the thick rope hanging next to them. This friend is particularly fond of this mountain house. Although he also has an Anne-era house in London, he does not come to London often.

However, personal preferences are different. Many English people are very trendy. In recent years, many apartment buildings have been built in major cities in England. Almost as soon as each building is completed, many people rush to it. Some rooms have excellent furniture and are decorated in the most popular styles. Some walls are decorated with images of musical stars and Russian rural dolls. The newest style uses very modern square furniture, and the walls are hung with Impressionist, Cubist, or Surrealist paintings. As for the practical style, it uses furniture made of steel and glass. The arrangement is up to the individual. These are just a few examples.

War

### The Great War and Pigeons

— Hua Zhi

Modern military communications are constantly changing. In the 19th century, an army traveling twenty miles a day was considered a remarkable record. In the 20th century, an army traveling three hundred miles a day on modern highways is nothing special. As the pace of warfare advances, what used to be counted in weeks and months is now calculated in days and hours. Various tools for transmitting messages, such as wireless telegraphs, broadcasts, and telephones, emerge endlessly. However, wireless communications are often affected by the weather, and telephone lines are subject to damage. Therefore, the ancient means of transportation, military pigeons, have not only not been eliminated on the modern battlefield but have also increased in power.

In modern warfare, the first large-scale use of pigeons was during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870. At that time, Paris was besieged, and a large number of pigeons were used to transmit information, but there were only a few hundred. By the time of the last European war, the number of pigeons used by various countries had increased to more than three thousand. As for the beginning of the current war, the military pigeons on the western front were traveling frequently, totaling more than one hundred thousand, which is three times more than during the last European war. The effectiveness they demonstrated even exceeded what wireless communications and telephones could do.

### Opening a Store

— Ming Xun

If a person is like a store, then physical strength is the capital, knowledge is the partner, credibility is the brand, and conscience, of course, is the store's supervisor.

If there is no capital, the store cannot be opened. Without suitable partners, the store will not be successful. If the brand is not strong, business will never prosper. If the supervisor is too lenient and reverses right and wrong, then the store will become more and more chaotic. As a result, it will inevitably be eliminated and closed.

### Disappointment

Disappointment is the opposite of hope.

Those who truly understand will never be disappointed, because they can accurately grasp their hope.

The disappointment of most people is because their hopes are locked away.

Hawthorne's Detective Work

### The Prima Ballerina's Final Destination

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter Four: Several Speculations

Hawthorne suddenly added, "The reason you exclude Lu Jiansheng is because your study of the 'scapegoat psychology' is too thorough! You must know that although there are many scapegoats in the metropolis, they do not all come from the same type. And psychological states are ever-changing. Even the same scapegoat, under different circumstances and situations, will reflect completely different psychological states. You must know that once they 'enter,' they may not be willing to 'exit' at will."

The car stopped again because of the red light. For a moment, I didn't know how to respond to Hawthorne's empty theory. Hawthorne suddenly turned to me and smiled, "Why have you become silent?"

I replied, "I'm quietly listening to your high-minded arguments. Then, do you think Lu Jiansheng is really a suspect?"

As he continued to drive, he smiled again, "Bao Lang, I believe that there is indeed a chasm between a literary mind and a scientific mind. I'm telling you, right now in my mind, everyone is a suspect, and no one is a suspect… Sigh, Yadon is here."

We entered the hotel and first looked for room 774 on the hotel register. Below this number was marked "Jin Jun." I was a little disappointed, but Hawthorne showed no sign.

I whispered, "Could it be that Zhao Boxiong has already moved out?"

Hawthorne replied, "Let's go up and ask. He may be using an alias. Wait, let me make a phone call to Ni Jinshou first."

Hawthorne went to the telephone booth. I waited outside and saw that the number he dialed was the police headquarters. After a while, the line connected.

He said intermittently, "I am Hawthorne. Please connect me to Detective Ni... Not back yet?... Does he have a phone?... What do you mean?... He didn't go to class today... Hmm, hmm... Where did he go at this moment?... Okay." He put the phone down.

When he came back, I whispered to him, "So Yu Gantang didn't go to class today?"

Hawthorne nodded, "Yes, he's not even in the dormitory. Ni Jinshou has already asked several of Yu Gantang's classmates. It is said that he has been missing many classes these days, and his whereabouts are very erratic."

"From this perspective, this person's suspicion seems to have deepened. Is that right?" (64)

The World of Entertainment

### Zachary Scott's Rural Life

— New Shadow

Hometown Success

Zachary Scott's hometown is Hollywood, and movies are the work he has chosen. Therefore, Hollywood is where he became successful. In his early years, Zachary studied in middle school. Because he knew that the entrance to film companies was not easy to get into, he never thought that he would one day become a movie star. But he had always been fond of theater, especially possessing a talent for acting. He always played important male roles in school plays.

Great Opportunity

From middle school to university, during his four years of university, just like in middle school, he often performed in school plays. One time, the goddess of luck shone on him. In a school play, he played the male lead, opposite a female student, Jane Wyatt. The female lead's father was a film director. He came to the school to watch his daughter act and appreciated Zachary Scott's acting skills, encouraging him to join the film industry after graduation.

Success Story

The director's eye was ultimately correct. Zachary Scott listened to his advice and joined the film industry after leaving school. He rose from an extra to a very important star, progressing smoothly forward. He starred in many films at RKO, MGM, 20th Century Fox, etc., and his performance improved very quickly. He is a person who loves sports. Swimming is his favorite sport. He spends all of his time on the beach. He is also very proficient in tennis and horseback riding.

Rural Life

In recent years, Zachary Scott has been particularly fond of rural life. Near Hollywood, he has twenty acres of farmland, some of which is used as a pasture, and some of which is planted with crops. He does the planting himself. Now he is also teaching this work to his son. When he is not filming, he often stays there with his wife, Elaine Anderson Scott, and children, enjoying family happiness. According to him, his love of rural life is due to heredity; it was inherited from his grandfather.

### "Thinking"

Cao Yu's trilogy, Thunderstorm, Sunrise, Wilderness, are probably known to all theatergoers. Cao Yu is employed at the Chongqing National Drama College. As school affairs are complex, he has not published any new works for a long time. Recently, it was heard that he has completed two plays: one is "Metamorphosis," which has already been performed in Chongqing and caused a sensation, and the other is a one-act play called "Thinking," which has been sent to Shanghai for publication in the recently published combined issue of Theater Arts, issues 66 and 67. The content depicts a declining traveling troupe. Seeing that their business is bleak, they temporarily change their profession to perform spoken dramas, resulting in many jokes. The whole play is humorous and engaging, a standard excellent farce. Cao Yu's previous works were all serious in style, but this play is a comedy that the playwright considered the most difficult to write. Therefore, it is truly commendable. The play has been designated as the repertoire of the Shanghai Art Theater after their move to a new location in Shanghai. At that time, it will surely cause a sensation among Shanghai's theater fans.

### The Great and Sublime "Confucius"

— Editor

In the past six months, I have often received letters from readers and movie fans asking when "Confucius" will be released and what the plot of this film is like. I answered them, "Minhua's attitude towards the production of "Confucius" is extremely serious, and the director, Fei Mu, is not one to produce inferior works. Although it has taken more than a year, it is still impossible to predict when it will be released. As for the plot, I have not read the script or seen the test footage, so how can I say? But it is safe to say that the awareness is superb, the content is serious, and it is beneficial to the world and people's hearts…"

Recently, I received a micro-letter from Minhua about publishing a special issue for "Confucius," preparing to release it at the Grand Theater in mid-August. This is such a pleasant piece of good news! Ever since domestic films began to tend towards historical dramas, I have not watched them for a long time, to show my personal inclination. But we must make a clear distinction, "Confucius," although a historical drama, should be treated differently. I must sincerely support it. First, because I personally received the teachings of the Sage Teacher since childhood and deeply feel the greatness of Confucianism; second, this film is produced solemnly, breaking the unprecedented record of domestic films. I personally will take this film to see the progress of domestic films.

"Confucius" is the sublime work of domestic historical dramas, worthy of support. This is a common saying among people, not just a personal opinion. I respectfully wish Minhua film production success!

### Folk Films: Xia Xia Not Interested

— Hai Xing

In the nine folk tale films of the League of Nations, each actor played four or five roles at most, and one or two roles at least. However, Xia Xia missed out and did not have a role in any of them. It is said that this is Xia Xia's request. Because she is physically weak, she cannot endure the rush of filming. At the same time, she is not interested in folk tales. When she made this request to Zhang Shankun, Zhang said that he would never force her. Therefore, Xia Xia had no roles. It is rumored that Xia Xia is already tired of the film life because the roles she is assigned on the screen are often elderly women, such as Yue Mu in "Serving the Country Faithfully." She believes that these roles cannot allow her to fully express herself. In the future, Xia Xia will change her style and show off her skills on the stage.

### Idle Talk from Hut Qi

— Su Shaoqing

Watching Bai Yuyan Perform "Da Chu Shou"

"Da Chu Shou" (Fighting Hand-to-Hand) is the special skill of a Wudan (female martial role). After Jiu Zhenfeng, there was Zhu Guifang. Both of them exhausted the skills of "Da Chu Shou." Currently, those who are good at this skill include Yan Shishan and Song Dezhu. The above-mentioned people are all male actors who play Wudan. Except for Jiu Zhenfeng, there is quite a lot of strength, but not enough grace. The physical condition of men makes this unavoidable. The only woman who practices Wudan and can perform Da Chu Shou is Fen Juhua. Although Fen Juhua plays Wudan as a woman, she also feels that she has more strength than grace. It is known that the beauty of combining strength and gentleness is very difficult for anyone, male or female, to possess. But yesterday I happened to be summoned by Mei Jun to watch Kunling Bai Yuyan perform Jinshan Temple, actually performing Da Chu Shou, and performing it wonderfully. There is a move in which she sits diagonally on the ground and uses a fake small foot to bounce back the spear thrown by the lower court's door god, which can be named "Magpie Kicking a Branch." This "Magpie Kicking a Branch" has a handsome posture, accurate vision, and stable foot strength. It is truly a wonderful product. What is commendable is that it combines strength and grace and can be called a giant of the female Da Chu Shou. Her costume is very beautiful. Her face is long, her eyes are quite beautiful, her nose is good, and her teeth are also good. However, she needs to add more vitality to her expressions for her demeanor to become more vivid. She should study her pronunciation and enunciation more. The Kunqu melody and singing method are not suitable for women's high voices. It is not her fault that she does not sing loudly. Before that, there was also Tan Mu, where she played the princess. It is a pity that I did not get to listen to it. It must be better than the Zuihua Yin suite sung in Jinshan Temple, it can be asserted. The little Lianying who accompanied her as Qing'er is also a Kun female role. Her costume and movements are good. Her eyebrows move frequently, and her posture is flexible, similar to Zhang Wenyuan in her prime. She is also only seventeen or eighteen years old, so there is no fear that she will not become a good role in the future. There are many talented female actors, and they are even more prevalent in recent years. Within a month, I inadvertently saw two talented Kun female actors, so I am happy to record this. Kunqu opera performances burn incense and use water, mainly singing, with absolutely no "Da Chu Shou." When Ping opera troupes perform it, Wudan, who knows Da Chu Shou, is played, which adds this martial art. It is said that Jiu Zhenfeng started it, but this matter remains to be investigated.
