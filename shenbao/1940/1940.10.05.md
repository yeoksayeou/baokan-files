### Responding to the New Far East Environment: British Government Decides to Actively Assist China; Churchill Gives Assurance to Ambassador Quo Tai-chi; Burma Road Permitted to Reopen as Scheduled

London – Chinese Ambassador to Britain, Quo Tai-chi, was invited by Prime Minister Churchill to visit last night. It is reported that a full review of the Burma Road issue was conducted. It is widely expected that an official statement regarding the British decision will be issued soon. (Reuters, 4th)

London – Since the British government reorganized yesterday, Prime Minister Churchill's initial expression of his political stance was to meet with Chinese Ambassador Quo Tai-chi. It is widely believed that Mr. Churchill revealed to the ambassador that Britain is prepared to open the Yunnan-Burma Road after October 18. The Chinese Ambassador also inquired, "Britain will also provide China with expanded economic assistance," and criticized America's recent loans to China as an expression of that country's foreign policy, and that Britain might also follow suit so as not to be outdone by the United States. Authoritative sources within the government here believe that former Prime Minister Chamberlain's appeasement policy towards Germany and Italy has failed. If Japan is appeased again, the extent of the failure will be no less than that towards Germany and Italy. The government here believes that Japan's dispatch of troops to Annam and occupation of naval and air bases there, and the formation of an alliance with the Rome-Berlin Axis countries all indicate that a new policy must be adopted to cope with the new environment. (United Press, 4th)

Washington – US Secretary of State Hull solemnly declared yesterday that the United States opposes the closure of the Yunnan-Burma Road because it is an important international trade route. When asked to comment on reports that Britain is preparing to reopen the Yunnan-Burma Road when the Anglo-Japanese agreement expires on the 17th of this month, Hull made the above declaration. (United Press, 4th)

Chongqing – According to responsible sources, the British reopening of the Burma Road on October 17 is practically guaranteed at this point. Chinese transportation authorities are now stepping up preparations to cope with transportation issues once the road is open. The major problem that the authorities believe must be addressed is that Japanese aircraft will inevitably take off daily from their new bases in Vietnam to bomb and strafe the road. However, it is pointed out that this Japanese air raid will not seriously hinder traffic on the road. Even under heavy Japanese air raids, Chinese vehicles traveling along the Vietnam highway through Zhennanguan have continued to operate without interruption. Moreover, the situation of the Burma Road is different from that of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, which cannot be severely damaged by bombing. Since its completion, the Burma Road has not been widely used. Due to the shorter route and fuel savings, most Chinese transportation has taken the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway and Highway. Since the Japanese army occupied Vietnam, the Chinese side must now use the Burma Road as a main route for imports and exports. Chinese transportation authorities are currently busy mobilizing and organizing large convoys of trucks and livestock to cope with the heavy cargo traffic after the road reopens on October 17.

Maintaining Interests in the Far East: Talks Between the US and the Soviet Union

Washington – The attitude of the United States towards the Soviet Union's reaction to the pact of Germany, Italy, and Japan has attracted special and widespread attention here, because the Soviet Union and Japan are hereditary enemies in the Far East, and their interests currently coincide with those of the United States. US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Steinhardt, has held discussions with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. (Reuters, 4th)

Strengthening Defense to Cope with the Crisis: Hong Kong is Fully Prepared

Hong Kong – A telegram sent today by the British Minister of Aircraft Production, Beaverbrook, is highly valued here. Mr. Beaverbrook telegraphed, "The British people should repay those Englishmen in China who have done their best." Local circles believe that this telegram is completely consistent with the attitude taken by Prime Minister Churchill yesterday after the cabinet reshuffle when he met with Chinese Ambassador Quo Tai-chi. Judging from recent news from London, this situation clearly indicates that Britain no longer intends to continue its appeasement policy towards Japan. Currently, Hong Kong has increased its preparations, air-raid shelters have been built everywhere, and the Evacuation Committee has rejected many requests for exemption from departure. According to the authorities, "The possibility of increasing evacuation ships to Australia is currently being considered." (United Press, 4th)

Soviet Statement: Unwilling to Divide Spheres of Influence in China with Japan

Moscow – "The Soviet Union has never declared its willingness to conclude a non-aggression pact with Japan on the condition of dividing spheres of influence in China." This definitive statement was issued by Moscow in response to a question from a Reuters reporter, and stated that the Soviet Union maintains a good-neighborly policy. If Japan has good intentions, it is not impossible for the Soviet Union to approach Japan. This point has been explained by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov in August. (Reuters, 4th)

Japan Threatens War: Still Attempting to Adjust Relations with the US

Tokyo – Semi-official sources say Japanese Prime Minister Konoe recently announced that Japan is prepared to adjust its relations with the US and the Soviet Union. (United Press, 4th)

Tokyo – Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma recently said that the purpose of the German-Italian-Japanese alliance is to build a new order in Europe and Asia, not to promote victory in the war. Suma also pointed out the danger of the United States helping Britain participate in the war. If a third country outside the Allied countries participates in the war to help Britain, the Japanese navy in the West Pacific will assist the Axis powers in combat. (United Press, 4th)

Tokyo – Some Japanese newspapers today hinted that if the United States and Britain do not openly oppose Japan because of the Tripartite Pact, there is still hope for maintaining friendly relations between Japan and those two countries. However, the "Kokumin Shimbun" took the opposite stance, warning that Japan might participate in the European war. The primary pressure exerted by Britain and the United States on Japan is the reopening of the Yunnan-Burma Road. The newspaper said, "The United States is obviously the instigator behind this evil drama. Britain's anti-Japanese performance is due to its setbacks in Europe." The "Kokumin Shimbun" continued, "Although the withdrawal of Japanese residents from London does not mean that Japan will immediately join the European war, Britain should know that the reason for the Japanese withdrawal is not because of difficulties in living and conducting business there." However, the "Chugai Shimbun" stated that unless Britain and the United States openly express various suspicions about the Tripartite Pact or take unfavorable actions against Japan, Japan will continue to maintain friendly relations with them. The "Chugai Shimbun" also emphasized that Japan should closely monitor the future actions of Britain and the United States. (United Press, 4th)

British Press Comments on Japan's Policy: Moving Towards a Reckless and Destructive Path

London – An editorial in "The Times" discusses Japan's role in the German-Italian-Japanese alliance: The goals of Nazi diplomacy are very clear, but it is difficult to understand what Japan hopes to gain from the new alliance. Japanese politicians naturally argue that if Germany defeats Britain and uses the threat of interfering in American affairs to prevent the United States from mobilizing, Japan will be the undisputed master of the Pacific. Those who insist on their own views will inevitably believe that Germany's strength is sufficient to achieve this result. Let us assume that this belief is correct, but Japan has already obtained all the benefits it can from the European war. Germany has exhausted its greatest efforts to defeat Britain and soften the United States. In addition, Germany cannot do anything else to please Japan. The current tripartite alliance does not increase Germany's capabilities or strengthen its military efforts; it only causes Japan to pursue interests that even the most short-sighted know are empty, and invites incalculable future consequences. Japan's situation in Asia is similar to Germany's in Europe. If it had adopted a path of peaceful cooperation, it could have occupied a prominent and respected position in China's economic development. Instead, it imitated Germany, lacking the necessary self-confidence and self-control for this task, and fell into a reckless and destructive path. Britain and the United States have repeatedly tried to establish a sympathetic understanding of Japan's needs, but Japan regarded this as a sign of weakness and used their concessions as a starting point for continued aggression. Japan's actions over the past three years have often deliberately provoked Western countries. Now, by joining an alliance with the Axis powers, it must be recognized that this is the last step in Japan's advance. Japan's foreign policy has always been known for its prudence, but now it has abandoned it, which is truly regrettable. One country that expresses happiness upon hearing of this alliance is China, because its far-sighted rulers are confident that Japan's deliberate provocation of hostility from Britain and the United States is tantamount to selling its future and suffering the consequences of Germany's failure.

China Has Not Yet Taken Steps to Recall Ambassadors to Germany and France

Chongqing – Reuters learned from responsible sources that the National Government has not yet taken steps to recall the Chinese ambassadors to Germany and France, and the chargé d'affaires in Italy. However, there is much speculation about whether China will take any action after Britain reopens the Burma Road. (Reuters, 4th)

Editorial

### From Rice Prices to Rice Hoarding

Recently, the highest grade of white polished rice has sold for as high as 95 or 96 yuan, an unprecedented price. Although this is the price of a very small quantity of rice and cannot be considered a benchmark, other rice prices have been driven up as a result. This newspaper has long been aware of this and has consistently advocated that domestic and imported rice should be valued equally to avoid the situation where one rises in response to the other. Unfortunately, this evaluation work has not been able to proceed as usual, allowing rice market speculation to run rampant, with high prices emerging from under the table one after another, leading to today's extraordinary prices. Rice merchants and hoarders are, of course, complacent and satisfied, with huge profits in hand and smiles on their faces, not thinking about the countless people in the sea of humanity who are crying in ragged clothes, unable to even get a bowl of porridge. How many such people are there, one wonders. Some explain it away by saying that if domestic rice is expensive, one can eat imported rice; if imported rice is expensive, one can eat mung beans. But what if mung beans are also expensive? I have seen men, women, and children waiting for the government to sell rice at reduced prices, getting up before dawn and not being able to redeem their ration until midday. They can only buy enough rice for a day's hunger. Yet they stand shoulder to shoulder, like geese in formation, and are whipped if they are not careful. Why must they endure such misery and abuse? It is because what they earned in the past was more than enough to maintain their past lives, but what they earn today is not enough to maintain their current lives. All of this is due to the hoarders with resources and the rice merchants who manipulate the market. Without hoarders, rice prices would never rise without falling; without manipulation, rice, even if expensive, would not be so expensive. Moreover, hoarding rice today is not easy. A bag of imported rice costs over 90 yuan, and a bag of polished rice costs over 120 yuan. A hundred bags would cost more than ten thousand gold, let alone the thousands or tens of thousands of bags that are hoarded. Therefore, without hundreds of thousands or millions of yuan, one cannot even begin; without power, one would not dare to hoard. Hoarding and manipulating the people's food supply is not only severely punished by law but also cracked down on by municipal authorities. Yet, those who dare to commit this great wrong must have something to rely on, something to pretend to, something to collude with. There is something that neither the law can sanction nor public opinion can move. Only then do they dare to act boldly, dare to profit from the people's food, and dare to oppress the masses. As a result, there must be many hoarders, but who they are has not been revealed. It is not that there are no people [to investigate], but like city foxes and shrine rats, they have something to rely on; it is not that there is no punishment, but they are hesitant to strike, fearing repercussions. Thus, the momentum of rising rice prices is unmatched. This is not an empty statement to scare the world. Let's take second-grade white polished rice as an example. The average price in the 25th year of the Republic was 9.90 yuan, 11.90 yuan in the 26th year, and 12.10 yuan in the 27th year. Even during the three years of war, rice prices were still relatively stable. In the 28th year, speculation in all goods yielded huge profits, so speculators returned to the rice market. In that year, from January to July, the rice price rose from 11.50 yuan to 19.30 yuan, which was still not considered high. After August, prices rose monthly, reaching 38.80 yuan. By this year, from a rice price of just over 38 yuan, it has risen to over 90 yuan in October, nine times the rice price in the year the Shanghai War broke out. Even converted to British pounds, the value in the 25th year was 145 pence, but now, even using the lowest estimate of 1.5 pence (in reality, it is more), it is 315 pence, more than double the value. Therefore, the rise in rice prices has occurred in the past year. How could rice prices have suddenly risen so high in this one year? Apart from hoarding and speculation, there is no other explanation. At the beginning of the lunar year, there were many rumors in the rice market that rice prices would reach at least 100 yuan, so the rice price rose directly. Afterwards, there were some curves and twists, but the price of 100 yuan is now imminent. It cannot be said that this is not a premeditated action by rice merchants to create this high price. Even if they offer a hundred excuses, what can they say? I recall that in the 18th year of the Republic, the highest unofficial rice price reached 23 yuan. At that time, public opinion was very critical, but compared to today, it is like a minor wizard in the presence of a major wizard! Hoarding cannot be eliminated completely. Hoarding can also be a way to store food for the people, so saying that all hoarding should be punished is not a balanced or fair argument. However, hoarding that only aims to make a profit is, after all, the nature of a for-profit business and is not enough to be considered a hoarding disease. After all, seeking profit from capital and accumulating wealth is the norm and a reasonable plan. However, hoarding that endangers the people's food supply and disregards the public's livelihood, only caring about the enrichment of private interests, is punishable and unforgivable! It is well known that today's unscrupulous merchants dare to commit wrongdoing because they have many escape routes. If they are unsuccessful here, they can be successful elsewhere! However, unscrupulous merchants are still human beings. People know that it is pitiful to mistreat animals and want to treat them with humanity. But do they not think about treating people with humanity? If one can treat people with humanity, then unscrupulous merchants will also know that they cannot go beyond human reason and law, and will eventually know what to fear and what not to dare to do. However, if they are stubborn and unyielding, where is their conscience? Then, only by giving them a profound lesson can their stubborn minds be awakened. Therefore, the measures that should be taken against hoarders in the future are a crucial plan for stabilizing the Shanghai people's food supply today.

As for how to continue the evaluation work and how to devise ways to adjust the people's food supply in the future, I believe that what is urgent today is to take practical action, not to issue official statements. Use one point of energy to achieve one point of success. If one is truly concerned about the people's suffering and feels their pain in one's embrace, and deeply understands that the security of the Shanghai concession is closely linked to the safety of the people's food supply, how can one not act quickly and decisively and seek only to solve the people's food problem?

The general situation in Lang Son, which was occupied after a fierce Japanese attack, has greatly stabilized because it is believed that the Japanese army has quickly reached an agreement with the French authorities. The French side said that 2,100 French and Annamese soldiers previously captured by the Japanese may arrive here today. Several fortresses near Haiphong have been returned to the French by the Japanese army, so the French flag has been raised again in their vicinity, and French sentries have also taken over. The Japanese baggage train left Haiphong yesterday, and the troops stationed there will number 900, of which 700 will be used to maintain transportation. (United Press, 4th)

### Japanese Aircraft Bomb Chengdu: Heavy Damage to Tombs and Forests; Air Raid Alert in Chongqing as Well

Chongqing – Today, Japanese aircraft bombed Chengdu, causing only heavy damage to tombs and forests. A large fire was still burning four hours after the bombing. At the same time, there was an air raid alert in Chongqing, but the Japanese aircraft did not arrive. The entire city's residents took shelter underground, lasting for four hours and a half, only coming out at 2 pm. According to well-informed sources, the purpose of the Japanese air raid was to scout out newly added bases of the Chinese Air Force, hoping to cause damage, but this time it clearly failed to achieve its goal. Also, Shantay (transliteration), 80 miles northeast of Chengdu, and Liangshan (transliteration), 100 miles northeast of Chongqing, were also heavily bombed. (United Press, 4th)

Chongqing – Three batches of Japanese bombers, protected by several fighter planes, flew into Sichuan Province this morning, dropping many bombs in the suburbs of Chengdu. The losses are unknown. An air raid alert was issued in Chongqing at 10 am and lifted around 2 pm. Only one reconnaissance plane flew over Chongqing without any bombers appearing. (Havas News Agency, 4th)

Chongqing – A spokesman for the Military Commission recently told reporters that the Japanese army near the border of Kowloon, Hong Kong, has recently been transferred to the Vietnamese border to reinforce, resulting in a depleted force. The Chinese army has taken the opportunity to attack. In addition, all fronts are extremely quiet. The Japanese army is still on the defensive, and the Chinese army has not yet begun a large-scale offensive. It has been learned that the Japanese army in the Vietnamese border area includes the 5th and 28th Divisions, which were transferred from Guangxi Province. At the same time, the 110th Division was transferred from Shanxi Province to Guangxi for defense. The Japanese army launched two attacks in Conghua and Huaxian in Guangdong Province, but were repelled. In addition, the Japanese army is concentrating in Central China, so a large-scale counterattack by the Chinese army near Yichang is quite possible. (Havas News Agency, 3rd)

### Brenner Pass: Meeting of German and Italian Leaders, Foreign Ministers of Both Countries Also Participate in Talks, African Military Affairs at the Center of Discussion

Brenner, today at 11:00 AM, Hitler arrived by special train at Brenner Town, the Italian border. The station was adorned with German and Italian flags. As Hitler's train entered the station, an Italian military band played the national anthems of both countries. Mussolini was already waiting on the platform. They shook hands and exchanged greetings, then together reviewed the Italian Alpine troops and Fascist Party soldiers. Afterward, they proceeded to Mussolini's dining car on the platform and began their meeting. The foreign ministers of both Germany and Italy participated in the discussions. Those accompanying Hitler included General Keitel and Information Minister Dietrich. Accompanying Mussolini were Cabinet Secretary-General Sebastiani and Foreign Ministry Secretary-General Anfuso. The German Ambassador to Italy, Mackensen, and the Italian Ambassador to Germany, Alfieri, were also in Brenner. (Haitong Telegraph, 4th)

Rome: Officials here are maintaining strict secrecy regarding the content of the meeting between German Führer Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini at the Brenner Pass. (Haitong Telegraph, 4th)

Berlin: German officials recently gave a statement to foreign journalists here, explaining the recent meeting (the sixth) between the German Führer and the Italian Prime Minister, saying, "The Führer must have had a reason to meet with the Italian Prime Minister, and it always produces results. Although the results may not be immediately recognized, they will soon be recognized by all." When Hitler and Mussolini met in July, some countries were already showing signs of wavering. Regarding the journalists' inquiry as to whether the Brenner meeting would establish an agreement, the spokesperson only said that the results of the Brenner meeting were not convenient to announce at this time. As for whether Italian Interior Minister Sunar's continued stay in Rome was related to the Brenner meeting, the spokesperson said he did not know. (Haitong News Agency, 4th)

Brenner: The secret meeting between Hitler and Mussolini in Mussolini's dining car lasted three hours before concluding. Mussolini accompanied Hitler to his special train and bid him farewell with great warmth. Hitler's special train departed from the Brenner station at half past noon. (Haitong News Agency, 4th)

Rome: Today, the two dictators of Germany and Italy continued their discussions on the Axis powers' plans (the discussion began at 11:00 AM). Above the Brenner Pass, several fighter planes circled and patrolled. It is said that the atmosphere during the meeting between the two leaders at the station was extremely harmonious. The station was filled with German and Italian flags and decorated with flowers. The meeting ended at 1:50 PM. A communiqué was issued as follows: "Within the scope of a routine exchange of views, the Italian Prime Minister and the German Führer met at the Brenner Pass in the spirit of the Axis powers and had cordial talks. The two leaders, in the presence of their foreign ministers, jointly studied various issues related to the two countries for three hours. General Keitel also attended the second half of the talks." Before Hitler and Mussolini shook hands and bid farewell, they reviewed a detachment of Italian troops. At 2:40 PM, they boarded their trains and left the Brenner Pass. The Italian Prime Minister and Ciano also boarded their trains and departed five minutes later. (Reuters, 4th)

New York: According to news received here, Hitler and Mussolini will hold an important meeting today. It is reported that the leaders of the two Axis powers are already en route to the meeting location. This news has sparked various speculations, including the possibility that they are considering the issue of joint military operations in Africa this winter. A diplomatic correspondent for Reuters in London commented that recent political and diplomatic developments have shifted attention to the military situation in the Middle East, as it appears that the Middle East situation will soon become a decisive factor in the war. General Graziani, commander-in-chief of the Italian forces in North Africa, is aware of the great risks Italy is taking, so he is advancing slowly, cautiously, and in an orderly manner. The task he undertakes is extremely difficult because he must not only deal with the problem of transporting troops, food, water, and weapons across the desert, but his lines of communication with Italy are also constantly threatened by the British fleet. The terrain of North Africa makes large-scale deployment of Italian forces impossible. Its rear lines of communication are very long and vulnerable to attacks from the air and sea. Although Germany may not be able to assist with a large number of dive bombers, the supply problem will still arise, and British Spitfire and Hurricane fighters cannot be underestimated. British aircraft have already effectively dealt with the threat of dive bombers in the Battle of Dunkirk. The deeper the Italian forces advance, the greater the difficulties they will encounter, while the strength of the British forces will continue to increase. This is another advantage for the British side. General Graziani's reluctance to advance lightly is well-founded. A rash advance is prone to failure, and failure would be fatal, because it would not only lead to the collapse of Abyssinia, which has been cut off from foreign aid, nor would it only ease the situation in Tunis, but it would also cause the Italian people, who were already unwilling to go to war and whose lives were becoming increasingly difficult, to be unable to bear this setback. Because the military issue in North Africa is so important, there are rumors that the Axis powers will temporarily hold back in Libya while seeking opportunities in the Balkans and Syria. However, there are many difficulties with this plan as well. If the Italian forces cannot achieve their ambitions in Libya, then unfavorable repercussions for the Axis powers will inevitably occur in the Balkans and the Far North. (Reuters, 4th)

Berlin: German Führer Hitler, who rushed to the Brenner Pass, is expected to meet with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini this afternoon. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop also traveled on the second train. Both trains passed through Munich at midnight. Italian Foreign Minister Ciano will also participate in the Brenner Pass meeting. According to reliable sources, the focus of the meeting between the two leaders of Germany and Italy may be on Spain's signing of the Axis pact and the future reconciliation between Japan and the Soviet Union. The general public also believes that the rulers of these countries will discuss new military plans to coordinate German and Italian offensive operations in the African region, the Mediterranean region, and around the British Isles. (International Telegram, 4th)

Rome: According to unconfirmed reports last night, Prime Minister Mussolini has already left for the Brenner Pass to hold important talks with Führer Hitler. It is reported that during the meeting between the leaders of Germany and Italy, Article 5 of the Tripartite Pact will also be discussed, as that article had left room for determining the relationship between the Soviet Union and the Axis powers. It was suggested last night that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov be invited to attend the Brenner Pass meeting. (United Press, 4th)

Berlin: Führer Hitler suddenly left Berlin last night. It is rumored that Hitler plans to go to the Brenner Pass today to hold an important Axis powers meeting with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini or Italian Foreign Minister Ciano. It is reported that the main issues to be discussed by the two dictators are the relationship between the Soviet Union and Japan and Spain's formal participation in the totalitarian alliance. Ciano left Rome at 8:00 PM last night, but his destination was not disclosed. (International Telegram, 4th)

A photo shows Hitler and Mussolini meeting for the first time at the Brenner Pass on March 19 of this year.

### Åland Islands Demilitarization, Soviet-Finnish Agreement Signed

Helsinki: The Soviet Union and Finland have signed an agreement on the demilitarization and neutralization of the Åland Islands, following the 1921 treaty line. Negotiations on the islands concluded several days ago. (Reuters, 4th)

### British Warships Sink Italian Ship

London: The Admiralty announced today that an Italian "Cortellazzo" class destroyer was sunk in the Adriatic Sea on September 22 by the British submarine HMS "Tetrarch" (1475 tons). This is the second victory for this submarine. On September 9, the submarine sank a 3,000-ton Italian supply ship in the Mediterranean Sea. (Reuters, 4th)

London: The Admiralty communiqué stated that in the past few weeks, British naval and air forces have destroyed seven German and two Italian submarines. Recent attacks by enemy submarines on merchant ships have been more successful than in the early stages of the war. This is not surprising as a result of Germany's occupation of French Atlantic ports after the collapse of France. Because German submarines can use the aforementioned ports as bases, they can operate at sea for a longer period of time than those departing from German ports. (Reuters, 4th)

### Italian-Spanish Negotiations Have Ended, Axis Powers' Goal is Military and Political Cooperation

Rome: Yesterday, the main topics discussed during the press briefing here were the close cooperation between Spain and the Axis powers, Chamberlain's resignation, the political unrest in Britain, and the new Axis powers meeting predicted by Italian newspaper "Gazzetta del Popolo". According to officials, Spanish Interior Minister Serrano Súñer's long stay here was entirely Súñer's own idea. Yesterday, Súñer dined with Foreign Minister Ciano at the golf club. Súñer's formal negotiations in Rome have ended. According to political circles here, future political developments will take a different path. "Gazzetta del Popolo" stated in its editorial that the current goal of the Axis powers is cooperation in military and political plans. Germany and Italy are not in a hurry to end the war, but are determined to achieve final victory to reorganize Europe and Africa. Therefore, the meeting between the leaders of the two countries must be to discuss this issue. The actions of the Axis powers are often unexpected by Britain, such as Italy's attacks on Somaliland and Barani. Britain's cabinet changes are due to the increasing internal difficulties in Britain.

### After Chamberlain's Retirement, the Appeasement Policy Ended, Two Representatives of the Working Class Joined the New Cabinet, Halifax to Become Leader of the Government Party in the House of Lords

New York: Munich and all its sobering dreams and disappointing meanings have disappeared in the British government, and some new figures have joined the British government. The second major cabinet reshuffle in the British cabinet in the thirteen months since the outbreak of war between Britain and Germany has removed the last vestiges of the appeasement policy from the wartime cabinet led by Churchill. Chamberlain, who is thin and has gout, once believed that the agreement he signed with Hitler could ensure peace for Britain "in our time". Today, his political career and everything else has come to an end. The policy he advocated has now been formally rejected. But equally important as Chamberlain's departure is the promotion of two commoners to high positions. These two are representatives of the lower classes in London and have been on the front lines since the German army launched its blitzkrieg. One is Morrison, the current Minister of Home Security, and the other is Bevin, the Minister of Labour. No one is closer to the British government and the working class than these two. Bevin's joining the wartime cabinet will make the connection between Britain's production and combat closer. As far as Bevin is concerned, Britain can be very gratified to have this talent. As for the leaders of the combat part of the British cabinet, there have been no changes, which proves that Britain supports the continuation of the war and its current measures.

London: Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax will become the Leader of the Government Party in the House of Lords, replacing Lord Caldecote, who has been transferred to Lord Chancellor. Downing Street announced that Labour Party Lord Snell will continue to serve as the Deputy Leader of the Government Party in the House of Lords to assist Lord Halifax. (Reuters, 4th)

London: It is reported that Sir Anderson has been appointed Privy Councilor to replace Chamberlain, and will take over all of Chamberlain's responsibilities, the most important of which is the guidance of the Main Committee, which is to publish various matters on the agenda of the War Cabinet according to their order of importance. (Reuters, 4th)

London: The cabinet personnel changes announced on Thursday have been unanimously welcomed by London newspapers, which say that Churchill's first government was hastily formed in special circumstances and should continue to be reorganized. (Reuters, 4th)

London: Newspapers here unanimously expressed a warm welcome to the cabinet changes announced on Thursday, but all newspapers also have a tendency to believe that Churchill's first government was formed hastily under the pressure of special circumstances, and then it is necessary to continue to suggest reorganization. Among the criticisms from London on this matter, there are two prominent characteristics: praise for Chamberlain and general satisfaction with Lord Cranborne's appointment as Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs. The "Daily Herald" commented that although public trust in the main institutions of the government has never wavered, the time for change has indeed matured. In addition to urging further changes in government personnel, the newspaper also questioned why Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax had not been changed. Halifax's concessions to Japan have resulted in destruction, and his courtesy to Spain has only strengthened General Franco's respect for the Axis powers. Romania has now left us, and the Soviet Union has shown nothing but hostility to Halifax's requests. Anderson's transfer from the Interior is due to his inability to cope, but he has obtained a more responsible position (Lord President of the Council) as compensation. (Reuters, 4th)

### Wells Criticizes British Foreign Secretary

New York: British writer H.G. Wells yesterday harshly criticized British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax, saying that Halifax cannot represent the British people, holds anti-Soviet prejudices, and is not suitable for seeking peace. Wells said that Halifax is someone that all patriotic British people should avoid, and said that Halifax holds anti-Soviet religious prejudices and can never seek peace. To resolve the war, the Soviet Union is indispensable, because the Soviet Union loves peace and does not want to spend its resources on war.

### US President Schedules Speech, Involves US Defense Issues

Washington: The White House announced yesterday that President Roosevelt will deliver a "non-political" speech in Dayton, Ohio, on the 12th of this month, which will only involve the topic of US defense and review the entire defense plan of Latin American countries. (Haitong News Agency, 4th)

### Pacific Joint Defense, Britain and the United States Have Agreed on Principles, Totalitarian Countries Trying to Manipulate World Trade, US Experts are Studying Countermeasures

A correspondent for the "Daily Mail" in London telegraphed the newspaper from Washington today, stating that representatives from Britain, the United States, and Australia have agreed on an agreement for joint action in the Pacific Ocean. When this action is implemented, there will not be much delay. It is said that the basic principles of the agreement are roughly that the US fleet will be responsible for the defense of the Pacific Ocean, while the British fleet will guard the Atlantic Ocean. The following four factors are very important: (1) If Britain cannot continue to effectively blockade the Atlantic Ocean and continue to control the Mediterranean Sea, then 400 million people in Europe will be ruled by Germany. (2) Japan may control 300 million people. (3) The Soviet Union will rule 200 million people. (4) The people of the German, Soviet, and Japanese political and business alliance reach 1 billion, while the United States and Canada have only 150 million.

Experts are now studying how to adjust US trade under the new threat of totalitarian countries. It is obvious that the United States' trade in Europe will decrease in the future. German and Italian machinery manufacturers in South America are now competing with countries in the Western Hemisphere. After the end of the European war, the supply of goods from Europe will be much cheaper than that from the United States. It is said that Germany will exchange its machinery for Brazilian coffee, Uruguayan meat, and Argentine wheat. Officials believe that if the United States wants to continue to dominate the Western Hemisphere, this issue must be resolved. (International News Agency, 4th)

### Japan and the Dutch East Indies are Negotiating, Now in a Delicate Stage, Horiuchi's Return to His Country is Postponed

Tokyo: When Foreign Ministry spokesperson Suma met with news reporters today, he was asked if the talks with the Dutch East Indies had reached a delicate stage and if the Japanese representatives were now planning to break off the talks. When asked if this news was accurate, the spokesperson replied that the meeting was still in progress, but although the chief Japanese representative, Kobayashi, had spoken with the Dutch Governor-General when he arrived in Batavia, he has not yet participated in the meeting. When asked when the outgoing Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Horiuchi, would depart from Washington to return to his country, the spokesperson replied that the date has not been determined. Horiuchi was originally scheduled to depart from San Francisco at the end of September, but his wife suddenly suffered from appendicitis and had to be hospitalized for surgery, so his departure has been postponed.

### Air Defense Drills Held in Tokyo

Tokyo: Today, air defense exercises entered an expanded phase. These exercises are different from ordinary ones and are obviously intended to impress the people with the fact that Japan is vulnerable to air raids. Because most Japanese houses are made of wood, special precautions should be taken. According to a communiqué issued by the Air Defense Exercise Headquarters, "Enemy air squadrons, each with eight or nine large bombers, flew south along the Pacific Ocean, then turned toward Japan and reached Tokyo, bombing fiercely for 30 minutes from 10:15 AM. Attention should be paid to railways, telegraphs, telephones, transportation, and broadcasting stations. Ground losses were quite heavy. During the '30-minute air raid,' all transportation in the affected area was suspended." (Reuters, 4th)

### Marriage Knowledge

— Authored by American Medical Doctor Yao Chongpei and Venereal Disease Specialist Zhan Nianceng

Male sexual health is the driving force of love... It is also the factor that beautifies life, the engine that creates the world...

Humans are emotional animals; humans are not unfeeling. Because of the function of emotion, families can prosper, societies can be formed, life can be beautified, and the world can be full of vitality, light, and continuous progress. If humans were without emotion, then there would be no family, friends, relatives... or other human relationships. Social organizations would crumble, and the world would be a cold and desolate place. Not only that, but people eating would be like taking medicine, men and women marrying would be like doing hard labor, and the human world would face the danger of extinction! Therefore, emotion is an indispensable thing for each of us.

Emotion is the expression of sex; sex is the foundation of emotion. The occurrence of emotion is entirely based on sex. Let's take love as an example. If a man has strong sexual function and marries a beautiful and graceful woman, the love between them will surely be passionate and abundant. It is truly a case of spiritual and physical harmony. They love each other, share meals, and spend their days in joy and happiness. In this situation, their spirits and bodies are completely integrated. What's yours is mine, and what's mine is yours. There is truly no distinction between us. When I comfort you, I comfort myself at the same time. Their love is so strong! At the same time, their children, the crystallization of their love, will surely be intelligent and clever. The families they form will surely be happy and sweet. Their lives will be so beautiful and joyful! If a man, due to early self-abuse and nocturnal emissions, or post-marital debauchery and overwork, suffers from spermatorrhea, seminal leakage, dissipated energy, neurasthenia, incomplete development, thin sperm, infertility, etc., then even if he has beautiful wives and concubines, he will be defeated in every sexual encounter. This will be a wake-up call to the man, and all will be lost. But for the partner who is full of passion and eager for comfort, how heartbroken she will be. As a result, love breaks down, and all kinds of tragedies are played out in families! On the man's side, it may even lead to premature aging and early death! Wise husbands who want to seek remedy, according to world-renowned doctors and my own experience, all agree that taking the gonadotropic hormone preparation "Reproduction Hormone" is the most effective treatment. This preparation is extracted from the gonads of strong animals such as apes and gorillas and reproduced using scientific methods. After taking it, it can produce sperm, nourish the kidneys, strengthen the brain, activate blood circulation, and nourish the nerves within a day and night. If you continue to take it, you will surely be able to completely cure the above symptoms in a short period of time, and it can also have the effect of prolonging life and rejuvenating youth. However, those with spermatorrhea must also take "Hemet's Sperm-Locking Pills" to strengthen the seminal gate and stop spermatorrhea, so that both the root and the symptoms are treated, and the effect is even faster!

### Breasts are the Messengers of Female Happiness

— American Medical Doctor Yao Chongpei

If unfortunately shriveled, seek scientific remedy quickly. The mystery and ingenuity of the Creator is beyond words. Look: If a young woman has a slender waist and plump buttocks but does not have a pair of high, soaring breasts in front, then the most beautiful curves of the female form cannot be created. How can she be mysteriously sensual and respected and admired everywhere? Therefore, world-renowned beauty experts and physiologists such as Kang Delin and gynecologist Tang Posheng have said this: If a woman's breasts are higher and more elastic, not only in terms of beauty can they form the most mysterious curves with the waist, making every man feel good, but also because of the health of their ovaries, the vigor of their metabolism, their temperaments are always open-minded and gentle, their muscles are always crystal clear and white, and their thoughts are always sharp and thorough. Even when faced with difficult problems, they can handle them analytically, without feeling overwhelmed. In addition, because of the smooth blood circulation, a peach blossom-like smile appears on their faces. Even without makeup, they are extremely beautiful. Although age increases, youth remains. Their sexual life is even more infinitely sweet, forming a happy and fulfilling family, and giving birth to healthy and lively children. Such women are truly happy and lovely! But in the past, due to self-abuse, breast binding, irregular menstruation, vaginal discharge and other symptoms, resulting in weakened ovarian function and affecting breast development, the only remedy is to take the ovarian preparation "Reproduction Hormone" for women as soon as possible. This can nourish ovarian function, invigorate metabolism, regulate menstruation, and

### The Latest Treatment for Spermatorrhea

— Venereal Disease Specialist Zhan Nianceng

One wrong step leads to eternal regret! This is a warning to young people during the onset of spring fever not to go astray due to weakness of will. Indeed, the youth stage of life is the period for laying the foundation for a bright and happy future. At this time, one should exercise the body and study academics to be able to shoulder important responsibilities in the future. However, although a few of today's young people are soberly striving, most are living in a drunken dream, passing their days in a muddle, controlled by the environment, unable to restrain their own sexual stimulation, and committing masturbation everywhere. Not knowing is not a crime, and we do not deeply hate them for this. The worst thing is that they do not realize their mistakes after masturbating, which deepens their bad habits and causes spermatorrhea. Because once there is spermatorrhea, not only cannot the semen in the body be stored, but there is also a danger of it being depleted! If the semen dries up, the brain, spinal cord, and sex nerves will all be severely affected. Symptoms such as weakened brainpower, headaches, forgetfulness, insomnia, back pain, seminal leakage, premature ejaculation, and impotence will follow. In addition, because developmental function is hindered, the sexual organs become small like a child's, the production of semen is insufficient, and sperm is lacking, resulting in thin sperm and infertility. Such young people will not only be unable to work hard in academics and careers, and their future will be bleak! Even in the marital life of procreation, they will often be unable to fulfill their duties completely, causing pain and regret for their wives, and creating family tragedies! Or they will have difficulty having children, leaving a lifelong regret! Wise young people who want to seek remedy should take "Hemet's Sperm-Locking Pills" as soon as possible to strengthen the seminal gate, calm the nerves, and reduce dreams, so that spermatorrhea can be cured. If the above symptoms have already been caused by spermatorrhea, then the gonadotropic hormone preparation "Reproduction Hormone" must also be taken to nourish the brain and kidneys, increase sperm and blood, and nourish the nerves, so that the above symptoms can be cured in a short period of time, and the body can become healthier. If patients can come to our clinic in person for diagnosis by expert physicians and receive the latest treatments such as electrotherapy, injections, and surgery, a cure can be guaranteed.

### London Weather Turns Bad, German Air Fleets Continue Raids, Random Bombing in the Thames Region, British Aircraft and Anti-Aircraft Teams Resist Fiercely

London yesterday was the first overcast day since the beginning of autumn in Britain. German air forces continued to raid the British Isles, dropping bombs on cities such as London, with no specific targets. The bombing area was quite wide, including areas such as the Thames River basin in London, Canterbury, and Cornwall. However, material damage and casualties were minimal. The German side constantly sends single aircraft to raid, so the defenses in southeastern England and the counties near London are constantly on alert. However, most German aircraft are hidden above the dark clouds. The anti-aircraft teams are quite active, especially in eastern London. It is said that German aircraft fly over every few minutes and then leave after a while. However, the intensity of the anti-aircraft fire is no less than during a night raid. Just after noon, a train coming from Euston was strafed by German aircraft while passing through a small town in the Midlands, and three people were slightly injured. The train continued for a few miles before stopping. Seeing that the injured were not seriously injured, it drove to a large city, where the injured were taken to a hospital for treatment. The train's dining car was damaged by machine gun bullets. London issued three air raid warnings yesterday. The third one was issued in the afternoon and lasted the longest. (Reuters, 4th)

London. After experiencing several days of fierce bombing from the sky, London City once again exhausted its resistance last night, engaging with the raiding German aircraft. Yesterday's longest daylight air raid in London lasted four hours. Bombings spread across nine major districts in the British capital. Low-flying German aircraft attempted to repeat their past success, but were repeatedly repelled by the British side. German aircraft invading in the evening were finally driven back across the English Channel. German aircraft returned to Britain at night and bombed London and western England to some extent. (UPI)

London. The Air Ministry announced that the number of houses destroyed in the city of London was still being finalized, and casualties were not high. Elsewhere, bombs fell in the Thames River basin, Windsor. It, and Cornwall, but there was no major damage or casualties. A city and a small town in the Midlands were attacked, with slight casualties. Other than some destroyed houses, other damage was minor. One enemy aircraft was shot down near a town near London. Some residents of the town died or were seriously injured due to bombs and machine guns. (Reuters, 4th)

Berlin. According to our sources, more than 100 German aircraft flew to London yesterday and dropped 150,000 kilograms of bombs. When the last team flew over the central capital, nine fires were seen. Several other groups of German aircraft bombed military targets near London. The air raid was still in progress until 8 p.m. last night. Air raid alarms were constantly issued in London from morning to night yesterday. (Haitong, 4th)

London. Today, German long-range guns on the French coast opened fire on a British convoy in the Strait of Dover. It is estimated that the guns from the Cape Gris-Nez fired two volleys of three shells each. However, the convoy continued to sail around the coast. Residents along the coast were awakened from their sleep, houses shook, and the sea surged high. (Reuters, 4th)

### German War Report

Berlin. This afternoon's German war report stated that although the weather was bad yesterday, the German Air Force was still able to retaliate against British aircraft bombing German cities, heading to London and southern and central England to attack military targets. A gas company in northwestern London was hit and exploded, with black smoke billowing. German aircraft bravely attacked two major munitions factories near Coventry and Chester. Several halls and factory buildings were destroyed. Airfields near London and Cornwall were bombed by German aircraft. Aircraft parked underground were destroyed. German aircraft attacked trains and motor trucks north of London, achieving similar results. Compared with the actions of German aircraft, the actions of enemy aircraft were not only dwarfed during the day, but also invisible at night. Only one British aircraft attacked the industrial construction in western Germany, and only a few attacked the Norwegian coast. In total, the enemy lost three aircraft yesterday, and four German aircraft went missing. (Haitong, 4th)

Berlin. According to military experts, a supplementary German war report stated that German aircraft have been bombing Britain for 25 consecutive days. London and southern and central England have been bombed. Fires broke out at London stations, the Thames River's seaports, and docks. Airfields throughout the area were also bombed by German aircraft. British destroyers did not resist much. German aircraft easily flew to the western and southern coasts of Britain. German aircraft low-altitude bombed an airfield, hitting a hangar. At that time, the German aircraft were only 100 meters high. German aircraft attacked the ports of Cowes, Weymouth, and Newhaven, with great success. Cowes Harbour is on the north shore of Cowes Bay in the Bristol Channel and has steel factories and oil refineries, which were hit by German aircraft, causing fires. At the ports of Newhaven and Weymouth in southern England, there were oil and gasoline depots that were bombed, causing explosions and bright lights. Weymouth is very close to Portland and is also a naval base. A German bomber hit a British cargo ship near the southwest coast of Ireland. The engine room was destroyed, and the cargo caught fire. The ship was almost sunk. German Navy Captain Jeni's submarines recently sank eight armed merchant ships, totaling 42,644 tons. The British ship "Highland Patriot" (14,000 tons) has also been sunk. On the evening of the 2nd, Britain attacked northern and southwestern Germany and the occupied areas, only destroying a factory that had been shut down for many months. Several British aircraft attempted to attack Berlin but were repelled by anti-aircraft teams. One of them was shot down north of Berlin, catching fire and being destroyed. German aircraft attacked various parts of Britain, and British aircraft did not engage much. Only six were lost the day before. The fighter squadron led by German Air Force Major Petersen has sunk 90,000 tons of enemy ships and destroyed 40,000 tons in the past six weeks. (Haitong, 5th)

### British Air Force Fiercely Attacks Hamburg Oil Factory, Dropping Bombs and Causing Large Fires

London. In the past 24 hours, the British Air Force has engaged in extensive activities, attacking airfields and bases in Germany, Holland, Belgium, and France. Their special target was Hamburg. The large oil factories and storage depots there were fiercely bombed by batches of British heavy bombers for two hours. The first batch of British aircraft arrived in Hamburg at 10 p.m. and hit the targets, with four fires breaking out. The fires then spread and merged into one. The British aircraft that arrived later found the targets by the light of the fire and dropped high-explosive bombs on them. Soon another fire broke out. According to the Air Ministry's intelligence office, when the last British aircraft left the area to return to defense, it saw two places still ablaze, with thick smoke billowing and permeating the sky over the Elbe River. (Reuters, 4th)

London. The Air Ministry announced that during the day yesterday, the British Air Force bombed German bases that invaded Britain. Due to the bad weather, the action was quite limited, but the scheduled night bombing was cancelled due to the bad weather. British aircraft bombed ships near Dunkirk, a concentration of ships at the port of Rotterdam, and a factory near Chanze. British aircraft also attacked the Cherbourg railway line and oil depot. All British aircraft returned safely. After dark, the weather became increasingly bad. This morning, a German bomber was shot down by British fighter aircraft in the sea off the east coast.

### Greece Mobilizes Troops to Strengthen Border Defenses

Athens. Last night, after receiving reports that a large Italian army had concentrated on the Greek border, Greece immediately increased its troop deployment along the Greek-Albanian border to prepare for any eventuality. The situation here is now extremely tense, as there is deep fear that Italy will soon invade Greece. Italy had previously made territorial demands to the Athens government. If they were not granted, an act of aggression was inevitable. (Associated Press, 4th)

### Random Talks on the European War (18): A True Account of the British Air Raid on the Ruhr

This article is a true account of a night raid on the Ruhr by a 27-year-old airman (the author's name is withheld for military reasons) and three companions in a twin-engine Hampden bomber in mid-July of this year. By July 11 of this year, the author had flown more than 30 bombing missions over Germany, not counting the number of times he flew over Germany to drop leaflets at the beginning of the war. The original article appeared in the American magazine Life, and is translated as follows:

At 6:00 p.m., I was summoned to headquarters to receive instructions for bombing a target in the Ruhr area of Germany. I had been to the Ruhr area many times before, and I could fly there with my eyes closed. Over the Hamm railway marshalling yard, my two brothers and I bombed a train full of ammunition heading from Hamburg to Essen. Cargo barges in the Ems Canal near Dortmund were also bombed by us. In addition, we bombed a factory in Duisburg.

Our targets were scattered everywhere. When we took off, it was already dusk. We made a final check of the loaded Hampden. Then we took off immediately. The night was as cool as water and crystal clear. I knew that the entire flight would be pleasant. Flying east, I gradually raised the fuselage to 15,000 feet. It was 11:00 p.m.

As usual, the machine gunners were talking on the "intercom." They were in the upper and lower gun rooms, Mike above and Bert below. During this long night flight, they talked about their football experiences for an hour. My bombardier, Taffy, was always muttering and complaining about the night sky. No matter how good the night sky was, he always had to complain. I shouted to him once on the intercom, and all I heard back were those indistinct sounds. I guessed that he must be eating his chocolate and oranges again, as was his custom during air raids.

We flew close to Holland and saw only a patch of black. The shallow sandy beaches merged with the sea. To the north, I could tell at a glance that it was the Heligoland Bight and the anti-aircraft fire and searchlights over "Wind Corner," which lit up the sky. Other British planes had already had fun at Kiel. We passed through Holland and headed straight for Duisburg.

A pile of clouds rose below 6,000 feet. The light of the searchlights shone through in front, a sea of bright and beautiful clouds. I was thinking that we would be safe above this cloud layer, when I suddenly heard Bert say to Mike from the lower gun room, "There are six fighters below... I think they are German Messerschmitts... they are rising quickly... hurry up." He could clearly see their black shadows from the bright clouds. Of course, the Germans could see us too. I tilted the fuselage so that Mike in the upper gun room could see where the enemy planes were and aim his machine gun.

English planes in the English Channel

Bert grumbled, "They're not flying over, the shameful things..." Mike got excited, as if the Germans could hear him: "Fly up, fly up, let's have a duel." But the German planes didn't fly over. They hid far away and disappeared.

At this time, many things came to my mind. We had flown to the Rhine River, and the fuselage was gradually descending like a light feather, passing through the clouds. The faint moonlight below highlighted our ground targets. I tilted the fuselage in vain and pulled the control stick back, and the fuselage rose again.

In a moment, I told my companions on the intercom that we were about to prepare for battle. I held back the control stick and pointed the nose straight down. After Taffy found the target, he told me to hold tight. We plunged straight down through the anti-aircraft fire. The altimeter was spinning like a top, 6,000 feet, 5,000 feet, 4,000 feet. The sound of the wind and the sharp sound of the engine echoed each other. Soon we were in the middle of the artillery fire. The roaring sound was frightening. The searchlight searching for the target shone directly outside the aircraft window, and anti-aircraft shells shot up like a string of beads. Short-range anti-aircraft shells passed through another target. Even without these signs, we could have reached our destination. As before, the Germans lit up the target we wanted. The whole of Duisburg was as bright as day with searchlights and flares. There was also a kind of luminous thing, shining brightly, floating in the air, like tinsel hanging on a Christmas tree, both extremely beautiful and extremely frightening. When we rose, we watched these luminous things for a while, soaring and spinning outside the circle of searchlights and the range of anti-aircraft fire.

The sky above and in front of the fuselage was filled with anti-aircraft fire. The sound of shells and bombs exploding was louder than the roar of our plane's engine. I understood why. Other British planes had already gone to drop bombs in the low place in front. Part of the factory building had been hit and was on fire. The German artillery and anti-aircraft guns were obviously busy dealing with other planes and had no time to pay attention to us. We circled outside the artillery fire and searchlights, waiting for the sound of the bombs to stop.

The explosions below our fuselage caused the fuselage to sway. Taffy always told me to hold the direction. "A little to the right... don't move. A little to the left... don't move." I followed what he said to keep the fuselage in balance. When I relaxed the control stick to the back, I dragged out the bomb selection lever, ready for Taffy to press the button.

In that instant, the searchlights on the ground were searching for us. I just focused my eyes on the instrument panel. Looking down through the small hole in the grille, I caught a glimpse of the silhouette of Taffy's head and back facing the bomb sight, which was made even clearer by the firelight shooting up from below. The fuselage suddenly floated up and vibrated, and I knew that the first batch of bombs had been dropped. At the same time, a cluster of anti-aircraft shells exploded below, almost hitting our backs. When the shells exploded, the fuselage swayed greatly, as if a person's head had been hit. I didn't know if the fuselage had been hit, I just put the fuselage back in a balanced position. The pointers and other instruments on the instrument panel were still jumping around, but the roar of the engine was still normal.

The machine gunners stared straight at the ground to see how our bombs were detonating. Although only one or two seconds passed, it seemed like minutes. Bert shouted from the intercom, "To the right." Taffy always felt that he couldn't aim perfectly - and he was afraid of being hit by anti-aircraft shells when he released the bombs. I slid through the anti-aircraft fire to avoid severe shocks, but the searchlight was always firmly fixed on us. Fortunately, we weren't hit by gunfire, and in a moment the searchlight lost its position.

After turning a corner, I started flying over the target again, trying to get an extra accurate position. After Taffy aimed, we were back in the center of the anti-aircraft fire. Flares rose to the left and right of the fuselage, and the green flames illuminated the cockpit brightly. There was an explosion on the port side, and the intercom to the bombardier was blown up. I could only keep the fuselage balanced and motionless according to the last aimed position. This time we could clearly see the target on the ground. I even saw the flames in the factory building coming out from between the rafters.

When the second batch of bombs was dropped, the fuselage vibrated and floated upward again. I tilted the fuselage and looked down. At this time, the searchlights either couldn't shine on us or had been extinguished. I could hear Bert and Mike chattering away on the intercom. This time the bombs that were dropped were not in vain. I saw everything in chaos for a few seconds, and I didn't know how I flew later. I didn't understand if there were any other actions. I notified the rest of the crew on the intercom and asked them to prepare to escape by parachute, but my throat was hot and my lips were dry, so I could only say a few words softly. They didn't hear me - in fact, they couldn't have survived if they jumped down in such a high altitude.

Gradually everything returned to normal. Taffy was able to speak on the intercom. He was surrounded by gunfire and injured. When the fuselage turned, there was almost a big mess. The two machine gunners were fine, but they had a bump on their foreheads. The Hampden bomber is not as agile and can turn around as freely as a fighter. Taffy was still very calm, and in a moment he was mumbling again, asking if I was going to fly to the Essen area to find the target of the marshalling yard. I told Taffy to come up first and fix the lights on the instrument panel, because I couldn't grope around in the dark while sitting in the driver's seat. After the lights were restored, we set off for the railway station.

It was now 1:00 a.m. We had only stayed over Duisburg for about an hour, but it felt like a year had passed. The engine was smoothly encouraging us to fly over the Essen area. The searchlights shot up again, sometimes shining on us, sometimes not. On the way to Hamm and Dortmund, the anti-aircraft fire on the Ems Canal was very fierce. We crossed the fire net and moved forward. Mike and Bert talked all the way, talking about their salmon fishing in Scotland.

In a moment, the railway station was in front of us. I looked down and saw many trains full of goods gathered at an intersection. Looking down from 4,000 feet, everything was clear at a glance. The anti-aircraft guns were booming upwards again, and I couldn't care about anything at this time. I plunged straight down through the fire net. I dragged the bomb selection lever over again, ready to drop the last batch of bombs. After Taffy aimed, the last batch of bombs was dropped in a moment. They hit the target, exploding at the railway intersection and on top of a train.

Our plane descended straight down, turning around, until it was 300 feet off the ground, carefully looking at the damage on the ground. The small house at the railway station was on fire, the rails were cracked, and when we flew over, some of the rails had flown into the air, and anti-aircraft shells flew towards us again. I pulled the control stick hard, but this time it was not as dangerous as it was over Duisburg. After we bombed Duisburg twice to get an accurate target, we had no more bombs to drop in the Dortmund area, so we opened up the speed and flew back to our country. (End)

### The Yunnan-Burma Road Will Be Opened Soon; Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union Actively Assist China; the Cooperation is Further Facilitated by the Alliance of Three Nations; the United States Continues to Lend China Huge Sums to Support the War of Resistance

Two Authoritative Foreigners Analyze the Latest International Situation

A reporter from New Voice News Agency visited a certain foreign observer at his residence on Connaught Road yesterday to discuss the situation in Europe and Asia. When he talked about the alliance of three nations, he smiled and said to the reporter that the alliance of three nations has no other effect except to give Japan a heavy responsibility. Judging from its motives, it seems to be intimidating Britain and the United States, but Britain and the United States will cooperate more as a result, and the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union will also tend to improve. Germany had previously threatened to cross the English Channel and attack Britain directly, but due to its naval inferiority, it could not move forward. Then it used a large-scale air raid strategy to try to destroy Britain's strength, but the British Royal Air Force does not seem to be Germany's enemy, and the result of the air raid is not only insufficient to weaken Britain's fighting power and will, but also strengthens Britain's internal unity, as well as America's sympathy and assistance to Britain.

The Far East is Favorable to China. This time, the alliance of Germany, Italy, and Japan has aroused strong resentment from Britain and the United States, and further obtained sincere cooperation in various aspects. Germany's move will prove to be very unwise. Even in the Far East, it will only create a favorable situation for China. Without the constraints of the alliance of three nations, the Soviet Union seems to be able to provide more concrete assistance to China. The United States wants to maintain its Far East interests, and lending is an inevitable result, and Britain's consideration of opening the Yunnan-Burma Road is also not the end.

Opening the Yunnan-Burma Road is Not a Problem

The reporter also asked whether opening the Yunnan-Burma Road would be possible. According to the observer, opening the Yunnan-Burma Road seems to be no longer a problem. At that time, Britain, in addition to establishing an adversarial relationship with Germany and Italy in Europe, made considerable compromises and mediation with other countries in the world to the extent possible. Blocking the Yunnan-Burma Road was an attempt to compromise and mediate with Japan. However, the British people did not agree with this move. Now that the opening date is not far away, the British government has been urged to open it. At this time, the alliance of three nations occurred, then Japan has clearly become an enemy of Britain as well. Britain has no need or possibility to compromise again, so reopening after the three-month period expires seems to be no longer a problem.

The United States Continues to Lend China Huge Sums

The United States is actively assisting China. In addition to lending US$250 million, it has also lent US$130 million to China. A reporter from the Pyeongmin News Agency yesterday made a special inquiry to a certain foreign financial authority in this city. According to reports, the United States continues to lend huge sums to China. The number of Shanghai has not been able to obtain confirmed news, but it is known that the central government representative Song Ziwen is continuing to make huge loans in the United States, which is quite smooth, and it is also very possible. However, based on common sense, the United States will continue to support China economically in the future. This loan amount, in terms of quantity, is not large, but in terms of its nature, it is not a purely loan, it is just an advance payment and collects China's metal mines.

Supporting China is also Self-Defense

The result of China's three-year war of resistance has created a force in the Far East that cannot be easily intimidated. China's need for economic assistance from friendly countries is like the need for China to weaken the forces of the aggressors by friendly countries in the Pacific. The United States has long recognized this point clearly, so supporting China's war of resistance is to consolidate its periphery. The reason why the United States has to help China is here.

The United States Does Not Change its Traditional Policy

From the perspective of the United States' traditional policy, the United States' policy towards China, as we all know, is the so-called open door policy. We must know that this policy is based on the so-called balance of power in the Pacific. However, the establishment of this balance of power cannot be achieved by the strength of the United States alone, so it must be supported by Britain to be able to do it. At the Washington Conference, Britain did not continue the Anglo-Japanese alliance, but fully supported the United States, and as a result, the Washington Treaty was established. This situation came to an end in 1931 on September 18. The reason why this happened is that the British at that time did not cooperate with the United States to jointly sanction the aggressors, resulting in an unmanageable situation in the Pacific.

British-American Cooperation is Inevitable

However, this situation, with the expansion of the war in Western Europe and the rapid turn of events in the Pacific, the relative decline of Britain's position, and the relative increase of the United States' position, the United States' position has a pivotal trend, and Britain, in order to obtain American assistance, cannot but follow the lead of the United States in the Pacific and the Atlantic, so British-American cooperation in the world is an inevitable trend. For its own interests and to obtain American assistance, Britain has abandoned its imagined appeasement policy and given China active assistance. Opening the Yunnan-Burma Road and lending large sums of money to China is its due.

The Situation in Shanghai Can Be Temporarily Assured

The reporter also raised the question of the status of Shanghai under the Southern Advance Policy. According to the opinion of a certain financier, the status of Shanghai is also a part of the Far East situation, and it is determined by the international situation. However, it can be asserted that in the current situation, the attitude of Britain and the United States has turned tough. Although Japan has joined the alliance of Germany and Italy, it is involved in the China Incident and does not have the strength to engage in war against third countries, so in the short term, it can still maintain considerable stability.

### The French Business Water and Electricity Strike is About to be Resolved; Negotiations Continue Today

The strike of the French Concession Water and Electricity Company's tram, bus, and engine room, which has been delayed for ten days, has shown signs of breaking the deadlock since the labor representatives requested the French Police Department's Political Affairs Department to mediate. The labor and management have also been in contact twice in the past two days. It is reported that the labor will once again appeal to people from all walks of life for assistance. The details obtained yesterday are recorded as follows:

Company's Reply

Striking Workers Quickly Seek to Resolve the Strike. On the afternoon of the 2nd, six representatives were elected to go to the Political Affairs Department of the French Police Department to request mediation. At 7:00 p.m., French Political Affairs Minister Mallet. French Water and Electricity Company General Manager Favre. Transportation Manager Michel. And six labor representatives, with mutual concessions and understanding between labor and management, began preliminary negotiations. General Manager Favre immediately stated (1) Regarding the increase in rice subsidies, the company can allow the same treatment for the transportation department as for the engine room, (2) The arrested workers can be released, (3) The wages during the strike period can also be paid. The labor representatives must convey the conditions replied by the General Manager to all the workers before they can make a decision. It was immediately scheduled for today (5th) at 11:00 a.m. to negotiate again.

The English Great American newspaper reported this morning (4th) that according to a certain member of the French Tram Company, the tram and bus business in the French Concession is expected to return to normal tomorrow (5th). Labor-management talks are progressing smoothly.

Three People Were Kidnapped

At around 1:00 a.m. yesterday, three more people were kidnapped. Xu No. 26, No. 28, two ticket inspectors, and No. 10, a ticket writer. Although the relevant parties have tried their best to search for where these three people were taken, no clues have been obtained. The French Police Department and the company are very concerned about the continued occurrence of such incidents. According to a reporter from the News Agency, at noon yesterday, the French Police Department sent many Chinese and Western officers to arrest six tram company ticket sellers near Xiafei Road and Villermont Road. It is heard that they are related to the kidnapping case.

### It is Reported That American Banks Will Soon Refuse to Sell Foreign Exchange; The Purpose is Aimed at Japanese Businesses; American Goods Transported to the Mainland Have Been Completely Controlled

The Shanghai Times reported that the Allied News Agency said last night (3rd) that American banks in this city will refuse to sell foreign exchange in the future. Although it is not specifically stipulated that foreign exchange will only be refused to Japanese businesses, financial observers believe that this move by American banks is actually aimed at Japanese businesses, because it follows Japan's conclusion of an alliance with Germany and Italy, and takes this step. Some say that this move by American banks is not an economic retaliation for Japan's joining the Axis powers, but also admit that this is a preventive measure by American banks, fearing that American-Japanese relations will continue to deteriorate.

Coastal Blockade Prevents American Goods

According to another opinion, Japan is strictly blockading the Chinese coast, and the transport of American goods into the Chinese mainland has therefore decreased, and most of the banking business related to exports in the occupied areas is handled by Japanese businesses. The American banks' business of issuing export orders has been cut off, and the American banks' business has suffered losses, so they have refused to sell foreign exchange, which in turn has hit Japanese businesses.

Japanese Businesses are Uneasy and Seek Other Solutions

Some observers believe that the Chinese have gradually lost confidence in the pound, and now they are speculating in US dollars. American businesses have refused to sell foreign exchange in order to reduce this kind of speculative activity. As for the Japanese banking industry, it had originally expected a reaction in the Shanghai financial market after the conclusion of the pact in Berlin, and is now planning to convene a meeting in the short term to discuss countermeasures. It is heard that Japanese banks will conduct US dollar futures transactions through French and Belgian banks.

Cotton Spinning Mills are Most Affected

At the same time, the Japanese cotton spinning mills, which are most affected by this move by American banks, said that the result of American banks' refusal to sell foreign exchange will continue to reduce American cotton exports, and cotton spinners have already purchased foreign exchange and will not be affected by it for the time being. Other Japanese business leaders will also not be able to import new goods, but can purchase the goods they need from Chinese and foreign importers in this city.

### French Ambassador Cosme Left Shanghai for Chongqing Yesterday Morning; He Will Visit the Central Authorities to Discuss the Situation; He Will Meet Lieutenant General Degoutte in Vietnam on the Way

French Ambassador to China Cosme, arrived in Shanghai on April 28 this year from Chongqing via Hong Kong on the French postal ship Rossel. The ambassador originally came to Shanghai to go to Beidaihe for summer vacation, but later, due to

Tightening of the European War

The French and German sides have engaged in direct warfare. The affairs of this consulate have also become complicated as a result. Cosme was not in a position to leave immediately. It was not until the conclusion of the Franco-German agreement that the consulate and diplomatic affairs would be presided over by the ambassador himself. Therefore, the trip to the north was abandoned repeatedly. Now it is learned that the ambassador has no need to go north because the height of summer has passed. Therefore, he left Shanghai on the Yihuo Shipping Company's Mingsheng ship at 5:00 a.m. yesterday, first going to Hong Kong, and then waiting for the ship to go to Vietnam. The ambassador believes that although the situation in Vietnam has yielded to Japan,

The Situation is Chaotic

It has not yet been clarified, and Thailand is fueling the flames and demanding land from Vietnam. To what extent will the changes be in the future? The ambassador needs to understand clearly. On the way to Chongqing, he will first meet Lieutenant General Degoutte, the Governor of Vietnam, and stay in French Indochina for a while, and then take a plane to Chongqing to visit the central authorities and discuss the situation. While the ambassador was in Shanghai, he also had some

Leisurely Interests

The city has been experiencing heavy rains for days, and the roads have been flooded into rivers. The ambassador went to the China Building (commonly known as the Thirteenth Floor Building) from the French Association on Pushi Road the day before yesterday and specially ordered his attendants to row the No. 524 sampan to cross the boat. Observers stood around and watched. According to a reporter from the New Voice News Agency, the ambassador's wife did not travel with him this time and is currently residing in Dongjiaomin Lane, Beiping. It is heard that when the weather turns cold, she will come to Shanghai for the winter.

### Case of Japanese and European Soldiers Insulting American Soldiers Not Yet Resolved; America Awaits Reply

### Eight-Fen Stamps Not Yet Fully Printed; Temporary Combination Use Still Employed; Zhu Lieshi Commemorative Stamps Mixed for Sale by Post Office

Since the implementation of postage rate increases in the country, the Directorate General of Posts is currently designing and printing new 4-fen and 8-fen stamps for use. At present, the Shanghai Post Office, in order to facilitate public use, has already issued all 8-fen Zhu Zhixin Martyr Commemorative Stamps and the Peiping version of Sun Yat-sen 4-fen stamps. However, after they are sold out, spare postage stamps will be temporarily used in combination to make up the amount. The new stamps will not be printed in Hong Kong, shipped to Shanghai, and sold until next year. It is heard that some people mistakenly believe that the currently issued Zhu Zhixin Martyr Commemorative Stamps are the new stamps that have arrived in Shanghai, but this is not the case. According to inquiries by the *Datong* reporter, these 8-fen stamps were originally prepared for registered mail and the number prepared was not large, with only a small amount issued at ordinary times. Now that the postage for ordinary letters has increased to 8 fen, the need for these stamps has suddenly increased. Therefore, the post office is specially selling them mixed with other denominations to meet the demand.

### Notice of Temporary Suspension of Parcel Post

Parcel post notice from the Postal Administration: All merchandise parcels sent to various locations along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway should continue to be temporarily suspended from acceptance. All parcels sent to Qingdao and other locations via Qingdao should be temporarily suspended from acceptance.

### Shanghai Stock Breeding Company Director Ma Shao Cong Reportedly Kidnapped; Company Denies the Incident, Claims He Has Taken His Family by Ship to Hong Kong

Ma Shao Cong, the owner of the Shanghai Stock Breeding Company on Dunxin Road, a road built across the border in western Shanghai, a native of Guangdong, in his thirties, took a streetcar to the company office on the morning of four days ago. Unexpectedly, just as he arrived at the gate, several kidnappers, who had been lying in wait there, swarmed up as soon as they saw him, brandishing pistols and threatening him. As a result, they dragged him into a car and sped away. The matter has not yet been reported to the police. The *Pingming News* reporter inquired with the company, which initially gave evasive answers, but later admitted the incident and said that Ma had taken his family by ship to Hong Kong last month. Afterwards, the reporter inquired in the vicinity of the scene of the incident, and everyone claimed that the incident did indeed occur.

Another report states that it is rumored that Mr. Ma, the boss of a certain stock breeding company on Dunxin Road in western Shanghai, was kidnapped at his residence several days ago and has not been heard from since.

### A Teenager Forced by Poverty to Help a Korean Traffic Drugs

Zhu Chunhe, a 17-year-old youth from Yuyao, received elementary education. Due to the outbreak of the Shanghai war, he fled and became separated from his parents, leaving him destitute. He risked helping Koreans transport drugs for a living, earning a monthly salary of 15 yuan. A bicycle was provided by the Koreans. Every day, he transported 200-300 packages of morphine from Hongkou to the overpass building in the Huabao Fang on Huanghe Road, where he handed them over to the Koreans for sale. This had been going on for two years. Yesterday, the French Police Bureau learned of this and sent detectives to wait in Huabao Fang, where they apprehended Zhu and seized 180 packages of morphine, along with a bicycle. He was taken to the police station and escorted to the First Criminal Division of the Second Special Court yesterday afternoon and prosecuted according to law.

### Maid Servants Theft; Reeducation Implemented

Chunxiang, a 14-year-old maid servant in the home of lawyer Xu Zifeng at 269 Wuding Road, secretly stole 648 yuan in legal tender from Xu's desk drawer between October of the 27th year and August of this year. Xu did not suspect Chunxiang, until recently, when Xu's wife, Wu, noticed Chunxiang's poor behavior and planned to send her back to her native Danyang. Chunxiang, upon hearing this, demanded the return of borrowed money from the cook, Ms. Wang of Yangzhou, 275 yuan; the chauffeur, Zhang Yongguan of Yangzhou, 113 yuan; and Wang Yu, a female helper from Anhui, 50 yuan, but they did not repay it, leading to mutual quarrels. Mrs. Xu Wu learned of this, and the theft of legal tender from three years ago was revealed. She reported the situation to the Gordon Road Police Station, which dispatched detectives to the address and took Chunxiang and others to the First Special Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin requested punishment according to law.

### Song Chunyu Dies by Poison; Court Calls for Claim of Belongings

Song Chunyu, a native of Huzhou, 28 years old, resided in his native place and was engaged in shipping business.

In a moment of resentment, he locked himself in a room at the Yu Qiaqing Road Far Eastern Hotel and committed suicide by taking poison. He died from the severity of the poison. The First Special District Court dispatched a prosecutor to examine the body. Because he had no family members, the body was handed over to the Pushan Villa for coffin burial and temporary placement. To this day, his family members are still unaware. The Prosecutor's Office of the First Special Court issued a notice stating that if anyone knows the whereabouts of Song's family members, please inform them immediately.

### Hong Kong Education and Cultural Circles Launch Model Airplane Movement; Scheduled to be Held on the 27th of this Month; Plan to Establish Rotating Awards and Research Grants

(Hong Kong Correspondence) Hong Kong education and cultural circles are recently vigorously promoting the "Model Airplane Movement" in order to promote aviation knowledge among young students. This movement is of great help in increasing the foundation of aviation knowledge for young people. Advanced aviation countries, such as the United States, Germany, and Japan, have spared no effort in promoting the production and demonstration of model airplanes in recent years. This movement is quite common in the United States. The widespread development of the aviation industry in the United States and the enthusiastic participation of young people across the country in the aviation industry are all due to this movement. It instills basic aviation knowledge from childhood and enhances their enthusiasm and interest in the aviation industry. It is learned that several groups, such as the Hong Kong University Alumni Association, the Teachers' Federation, the Student Relief Association, and the *Ta Kung Pao*, have specifically scheduled a Hong Kong-wide open model airplane competition on October 27th in order to increase the understanding and interest of social figures and young students in model airplanes. The competition matters are now being actively prepared by the above-mentioned groups. It is said that this competition will be divided into three categories: outdoor frame airplanes, outdoor gliding airplanes, and outdoor gasoline-powered frame airplanes. As for the prizes, it is planned to establish permanent awards such as the "Hong Kong Open Model Airplane Competition Cup," similar to the Davis Cup in the tennis world, and "Aircraft Model Research" grants, to be awarded to the winners of each competition. The proposed competition rules are transcribed as follows:

Competition Rules

First Item: Outdoor Frame Airplane Competition (Hand-Launched Flight Method) This competition plane must have a skeleton structure and landing wheels. The wing area must be no less than 50 square inches. The maximum cross-sectional area of the fuselage must also be no less than the square inches obtained by the formula L2/100 (L is equal to the length of the fuselage, excluding the propeller). The weight of each 50 square inches of wing area must not be less than one ounce. Regardless of the form of the fuselage, the fuselage must be tightly covered, or no less than 90 percent. The current model airplane construction is still in its primary stage, so it is permissible for the cross-sectional area of its fuselage to be no less than 90 percent of the formula. All other forms and frames, or those not in accordance with the formula, may not participate. Second Item: Outdoor Gliding Airplane Competition (Hand-Launched Flight)

This competition plane must not be attached with rubber bands, and its wing area must not be less than 40 square inches. The wings, fuselage, and tail rudder can be constructed from aircraft wood or other (materials). However, it must be hand-launched and must not fly by relying on other thrusts.

Third Item: Outdoor Gasoline-Powered Frame Airplane Competition (Ground-Launched Flight) This competition must rely on internal combustion engine-powered flight, that is, the gasoline motor wing area must not be less than 200 square inches, and must be pushed by a skeleton-constructed motor for a limit of 30 seconds. The most important thing is that the competitor of this competition must calibrate the timer to 30 seconds. The plane takes off from the ground, but can be pushed by hand. The maximum cross-sectional area of the fuselage must also be no less than the square inches obtained by the formula L2/100 (L is equal to the length of the fuselage, excluding the propeller). Regardless of the form of the fuselage, the fuselage must be tightly covered, or no less than 90 percent. The internal combustion displacement of the gasoline motor is calculated at every cubic inch, and the total weight of the plane must not be less than 60 ounces.

Competition Regulations

The model airplanes participating in the competition must be constructed by the competitors themselves, but wheels, propellers, and other small parts can be purchased. Those that are entirely purchased cannot be selected. The model style can be adopted at will.

Each competitor will be given a participation certificate as proof that the registration fee has been paid. The certificate must be used to bring a friend into the competition arena. The number in the upper left corner of the certificate must be painted or glued onto the top of the wing, no less than half an inch to two inches high. Each plane uses only one number and cannot be changed.

Time Regulations for Each Item

First Item: Each competitor can get two formal flights, calculated by the average of the total number. If each flight is less than 15 minutes, it will be counted as one delayed flight. Three delayed flights will be counted as one formal flight. Each competitor can use three model airplanes, but must use one number to participate. They may use one or three planes at will as a formal flight, but cannot lend it to others or alter the number.

Second Item: Each competitor can get four formal flights, but only the highest record is calculated.

Third Item: Each competitor can get three formal flights, with the highest record calculated. If each flight is less than 15 minutes, it will be counted as one delayed flight. Three delayed flights will be counted as one formal flight. Each competition is only allowed to register two names.

### Gu Ziren Returns Home; Attended the World Youth Student Federation Congress in the United States

(Hong Kong Correspondence) Gu Ziren, the representative who attended the World Youth Student Federation Congress, arrived in Hong Kong by ship from the United States on September 27th. The reporter interviewed him the next day and discussed his impressions. He stated, "I received orders to go abroad last year and arrived in the United States in January of this year. After staying for three months, I went to Canada and only set off for Hong Kong last month. Over the past few months, I have been promoting the motherland and religion everywhere. The youth of America express great sympathy for our resistance, but the emotion is more than action. Because most of them advocate, they are trying their best to avoid war, and they will never take action beyond verbally sympathizing with the invaded. Moreover, in fact, the United States is not clear about all international trends until the election is over." Gu is scheduled to go to India next week and will be able to return home in the spring of next year.

### Silver Money Cup Ping Pong Match; China Middle School Defeats HSBC; China Storage Seven Wins Out of Seven Defeats Zhonghe

In the Silver Money Cup Ping Pong Match the other night, China Middle School vs. HSBC match came to be one-sided. After both sides chose their grounds, the match began. China Middle School used the chopping players Liang Wenyan and Wang Shaozeng to open the first two battles, and they won as expected. Then, Chen Chengqing, a player skilled in drawing, easily took the third game, and the fourth and fifth games were also not particularly competitive. China Middle School won five consecutive games, and the overall situation was set. Although HSBC wanted to chase hard after this, it was too late, resulting in a defeat of 13 to 0.

### Finance: Foreign Exchange Market Activity

In today's foreign exchange market, HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged. In the unofficial British and American exchange markets, the trend was slightly weaker. Speculators were selling US dollars all day long, while the price of shillings simultaneously increased. In the afternoon, news of a French-Japanese conflict further dampened sentiment. As a result, dealers continued to sell off, causing prices to decline. US dollars for this month were traded at $5.5625 in numerous transactions. However, trading activity thinned out before the close, and the underlying trend showed a slight rebound. Ultimately, British pounds closed at 0.46875, or 3 shillings 5.5625 pence.

Soon after, Chinese speculators entered the market to sell. US dollars for this month were traded at $5.53125 and $5.5625. HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged. The announcement of the silver equalization tax remained at 2.25%. Subsequently, due to significant demand from Hong Kong Electric, the underlying trend stabilized. Hong Kong Electric reportedly bought US dollars for this month at $5.53125. Later, Chinese banks also followed suit, causing a temporary tightening. Chinese banks bought US dollars for this month from US banks at half a cent. However, speculators suddenly sold off at noon, and prices declined again.

The afternoon closing prices were 3 shillings 5.53125 pence for British gold and $5.53125 for US dollars, both higher by 0.015625 and 0.0315 respectively from the morning opening prices.

Increased Selling Pressure in the Afternoon

### Gold Market Declines Again

Yesterday's unofficial market for spot gold continued to decline, influenced by the stronger foreign exchange rates and negative news. This created uncertainty, leading to increased selling. Although the market rebounded slightly in the afternoon due to short covering, it eventually lost momentum and closed at $5,812, down $41 from the previous day. The total trading volume was approximately $3,000. The price of gold jewelry remained unchanged, as did the prices for Customs Gold Units.

Spot Gold Declined by Almost Forty Yuan

Initially, market sentiment remained firm. Despite stronger foreign exchange rates, there were very few sellers. Gold dealers opened at $5,880 for twenty taels. Soon after, gold dealers aggressively bought, driving the price up to $5,908. However, as foreign exchange rates weakened and currency exchange houses heavily sold gold, the price declined. Securities firms sold twenty taels of gold at $5,860. Later, currency exchange houses covered their short positions, causing the price to rise again. Gold dealers bought thirty taels from securities firms at $5,880. Unexpectedly, gold and silver shops sold heavily near noon, making it difficult to maintain prices, which fell as low as $5,850. Ultimately, gold dealers traded ten taels at $5,858 at the noon close. The market showed further signs of weakness in the afternoon due to widespread negative rumors and continued weakening of foreign exchange rates. Gold dealers sold twenty taels to gold shops at $5,830 as the opening price. Subsequently, gold dealers bought ten taels from securities firms at $5,840. At that time, gold and silver shops were selling, pushing the price below $5,800. Securities firms bought ten taels from gold dealers at $5,790.

### Starting from the Purchase and Sale of Trademarks

— Cai Jiedong

A trademark is nominally a symbol of a commodity. In reality, it represents the entire commodity. The term "old brand" means that the significance of a trademark exceeds the commodity itself. The trademark itself has an intangible value, and when there are changes in the commodity itself or when a trademark is transferred, the trademark's inherent value becomes even more apparent. A trademark, as a commodity symbol, also becomes a commodity itself.

Although this situation is not common, it has been observed recently. Furthermore, it is no longer a simple transfer but rather a wholesale and retail sale, much like a wholesale distributor. The trademark's meaning as a commodity is even more evident. This phenomenon arises under current special circumstances.

In order to counter the "economic blockade," all imported goods must be reviewed. To make it easier for merchants to comply, certain types of products are approved for import, while others are not. However, if the trademark approved for import is exchanged with another factory, one party can freely import goods by falsely using that trademark. Therefore, they are willing to pay a considerable price, while the other party enjoys the benefit of selling, disregarding both reason and justice, and nullifying the good intention of allowing the import of goods with that trademark. The merchant women do not know the hatred of a conquered nation, still singing the backyard flower across the river. Today's treacherous merchants are even worse than this.

### Foreign Currencies Decline Across the Board

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw spot gold transition from a firm to a declining trend. British and American gold pounds also initially strengthened before weakening, ultimately falling by five corners. The supply and demand for British gold notes were balanced, and the market price remained stable. American gold notes showed a weakening trend, with the market price ultimately falling by twelve cents. Hong Kong notes saw a slight increase in supply, and the market price softened slightly by one cent. The supply and demand for Japanese gold notes remained balanced, and the market remained unchanged at $1.46 in the evening. Korean notes saw considerable demand, with the evening price falling to $1.15.

### Grains: New Indica Rice Recovers Slightly, Thick and Thin Japonica Rice Remain Scarce, Foreign Rice Prices Fluctuate

After a period of decline in the foreign rice market, prices opened higher yesterday due to three or four telegrams from various foreign firms placing orders. General speculators rushed to sell. Subsequently, actual sales slowed, causing prices to decline. In the central market, prices plummeted by more than 1.5 yuan. However, because the foreign prices were still difficult to lower, telegrams from Saigon and other places stated that the situation was similar to the previous market. Therefore, general merchants and large dealers were unwilling to sell lightly. The branches of the British-Chinese Bank in Saigon were still quoting $82 for grade 2 Saigon rice, while foreign firms quoted $80. The upper period for October was $79.60, all the same as the previous day's selling prices. By the afternoon, some took profits, and international rumors were unfavorable to buyers, causing the afternoon rebound to reverse again. The current price of foreign rice has fallen by about 2 yuan. British-Chinese original packaged grade 2 Saigon rice has fallen to about $78.50. Original packaged grade 2 Siamese rice is only about $77. Total transactions for original packaged rice were 400-500 tons, while transactions for spot rice were 4,500-5,600 bags. Grade 2 Saigon rice was priced at $68.30 or $68, grade 2 Siamese rice at $66.50 or $66, small-grain rice at $65.50, and rice tea at $68 or $67.

Thick and Thin Japonica Rice. As the decline in foreign rice prices intensified, the market supply disappeared. Although prices rebounded later, no one wanted to sell, resulting in no transactions for the entire day. The market for glutinous rice was originally slow. As a result of this influence, it became even harder to support, and prices fell by one yuan. Jinli special-grade rice opened at $73, Changdan rice at $71.2, and Hong Kong glutinous rice was the same. There were no transactions for glutinous green rice.

New Indica Rice. Recent arrivals from downriver have been quite strong, no less than 1,300-1,400 piculs. However, due to its soft texture and lack of durability, the owners all sought to sell quickly. As sales were poor, the price of new Indica rice plummeted by a huge 4-5 yuan. Yangdu and other fine Indica varieties also fell by 3-4 yuan. Zhuanqiao new Indica rice was priced at $82, Taicang Yangjian rice at $70 or $69, and Qingjiao Dujian rice at $72.

### Customer Sales Increase, Market Steps Become Tight

Flour. Yesterday's flour market trended secretly tight. While the price of flour from the number two flour factory was $16.50, the supply from various factories gradually decreased. As there was a customer demand movement, the current flour supply was insufficient. Additionally, rising rice prices further strengthened positive market sentiment. Therefore, speculative hoarders were again buying warehouse receipts. Old warehouse receipts have tightened to $18.10-18.20, and there is little available for sale. Due to insufficient supplies, foreign flour prices were the same as the factory's customer prices at $18.50-18.60. It is heard that Northern and Southern merchants added orders for nearly 10,000 bags, and wholesale prices in the street may increase.

Wheat. Yesterday's trading continued to be quiet, and arrivals remained scarce. It was even more difficult to transport wheat into the concessions. Therefore, buying and selling were difficult to start. It is heard that the price for scattered deliveries to Japanese factories was limited to $21.00. The purchase price for Chinese factories remained at $24.65. However, with the flour market tightening, sellers had the intention to raise prices, making transactions even more quiet.

### Domestic Debt Excited, New High Prices Seen Again

The unofficial securities market saw a slight change in trend yesterday. The market initially showed some weakness in the morning, but was pulled higher near the close, leaving the morning closing flat. In the afternoon, a Japanese telegram outage caused market misunderstanding. After the opening, buyers were extremely enthusiastic. Class C shares broke through $59, reaching a new high price of $59.50. Unfortunately, it failed to hold. The prospect may see a slight pullback due to excessive floating positions. Yesterday morning, buyers aggressively purchased shares of number 6, 16 and 41, although less than the previous day. Lianhe, Xieda, and Xinfu all had demand. Tongkang, Lianyi, Hongda, and Yichang were all sellers. The buying expanded sharply in the afternoon, with Xinfu, Lianhe and number 6 continuing to buy. Xin Chang, Jiufeng, Shuntai, Tongji and a large number of retail investors also bought shares. Tongkang, Lianyi and Hongji continued to sell off. Hengkang also sold some shares. The market price jumped half a yuan at the opening, and classes A, B, C, D, and E all saw high prices, adding frosting to the cake. However, it was heard after the close that the Japanese telegraph line had been repaired, clarifying the misunderstanding. As a result, the market price continued to increase by $0.10 to $0.50. The total transaction volume was approximately $1.7 million. A simplified table is listed below.

Stock Trading: Fifty shares of Xinya Pharmaceutical were traded at a price of $24.75.

Yesterday's stock market saw large volumes, with excessive floating positions settled and prices unsupported. Buyer appetite was strong during price declines, and transactions were extremely large.

London, 3rd (Thursday) Telegram: Today's London listed prices for Chinese foreign debt and Far East British merchant company stocks remain flat. Only bank stocks showed slight fluctuations. The price of the McCallum Bank stock increased by 2 shillings and 6 pence to £6.17.6. The price of the London-registered stock of HSBC Bank fell by £1.5 to £64. The price of the Hong Kong-registered stock was unchanged. The price of the Youli Bank stock fell by 5 shillings to £10.0.15. The rest were unchanged.

### Yarn and Cotton: Speculation Concentrated, Cloth Prices Soar, Double Horse Jumps Up $57.50

The yarn market is strengthening and the rising trend is particularly strong. This is because the local merchants have an urgent need for ten-count coarse yarn, which makes people feel confident. At the same time, the Japanese yarn market is soaring, which is intensifying the mood. Speculators are also becoming more active after a long period of inactivity, and the rising trend is strong. Merchants from Tianjin, as well as related and unrelated businesses, are all participating. As a result, the rising trend has turned around, and the market has gone straight up. Today, 410 pieces of yarn were exported to Hong Kong.

At the opening of the spot yarn market, there were many rumors circulating after midday the previous day, saying that the market price on the exchange had improved. There were few sellers and many buyers in the market. The first-round price was $1,125, up $10, and hovered around $1,130 for a long time. Later, it was heard that Guangzhou merchants still wanted coarse yarn. At the same time, it was said that the price of a certain yarn had soared, and the mood suddenly became heated. Buyers flocked in, and the market rose higher and higher, reaching $1,157. After the close, it rose another $10. According to the half-day transaction statistics, 4,270 bales were traded. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn rose by $57. The amount of yarn purchased by each merchant is listed on the left:

Merchants 2,970, Hong Kong 1,300, Total 4,270.

### Spot Cotton Up $10, Most Transactions are in Foreign Cotton

Spot cotton transactions have developed greatly, because the soaring price of cloth has caused the price of raw cotton, which are closely related, to rise as well. Therefore, factory activity is concentrated, and merchant buying is strong. The price of cotton has risen by $10. Most of the transactions are in foreign cotton.

Another message: In the foreign cotton market, the New York cotton market was quiet. Later, because the need for spot goods increased, and some short positions were covered, the closing price was higher than the previous day by 2-3 British units. The forecast for Indian quick cotton is an increase of one and a half rupees.

The trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai has been quite active recently. The inventory of the merchants is in danger of being bought up. The factories also know the difficulty of transporting foreign cotton to Shanghai. In addition, the price of yarn is soaring, and the factory's desire to buy is strong. According to this situation, the price of cotton will rise without limit.

### Piece Goods: Cloth Prices Follow Yarn, Step by Step

Domestic Cloth. Yesterday, the rising momentum of cloth followed yarn was very sharp. The buying interest was becoming increasingly strong. The strongest appetite was from local merchants, dyeing factories, and hoarders. The selling price at the beginning of the day rose by 1.5 corners per piece. Afterwards, it increased step by step. As a result, fine cloth and fine twill colored cloth rose by 7.5 corners to 1 yuan per piece compared to the previous day. Coarse cloth, coarse twill, and bleached cloth rose by 5 corners to 7.5 corners. However, Yihua coarse cloth only rose by 1.5 corners for 16 pounds. The rest were flat. 2,000 pieces were traded in the street. Customers from Hong Kong bought more than 500 pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, and coarse twill. Merchants from Zhejiang and Fujian bought more than 200 pieces of Yihua coarse cloth, and more than 100 pieces of colored cloth and colored twill. Merchants from Yantai in the north bought more than 100 pieces of coarse cloth and other goods.

Eastern Cloth. Yesterday, with the soaring price of yarn and cotton, the rising trend was very strong. The price of white cloth, fine cloth, and fine twill jumped by more than 2 yuan per piece. The highest closing price for fine Longtou cloth was $36.40. The price of fine twill was $30.025. The price of Sijunzi serge was $1.0875 per yard. Merchants inside and outside the street had good ideas and were buying a lot.

Exports. Today, 220 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong, 105 pieces were shipped to Singapore, 60 pieces were shipped to Weihaiwei, and 640 pieces were shipped to Yantai.

### Oil Cakes: Oil Prices Only Increase

Yesterday, the oil market only increased, with no decline. Although there are ups and downs in the current raw bean oil, the form of squeezing the short positions has gradually become apparent. There is no small pullback to be seen in the future. The results yesterday show that bean oil increased by another two yuan, and raw oil continued to rise by another three yuan. Transactions were 300 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil, priced at $76 to $76.50. 500 pieces for delivery in the first ten days of October, priced at $76.60 to $76.75. 2,200 to 2,300 pieces for delivery in the last ten days of October, priced from $78 to $78.25, back to $77.50, and then re-stacked to $79 at the close. 100 barrels of Qingdao raw oil, priced at $106.07. 300 barrels for delivery in the last ten days of October, priced at $107.50 to $108.50. 200 barrels for delivery in November, priced at $109.50 to $110. 500 tins of Yanhao listened to raw oil, priced at $100. 60 pieces of Jiaozhou bean oil, priced at $82.50. 50 pieces of Yanqi bean oil, priced at $84. 20 pieces of Qingqi bean oil, priced at $83. 250 dan of bulk Dalian oil, priced at $92. 500 dan of Dayou factory bean oil, priced at $92.50, $93.50.

Also, miscellaneous grains were exported today. 790 bags of sesame seeds were shipped to Hong Kong, and 100 bags were shipped to Singapore. 200 bags of corn were shipped to Weihaiwei. 220 bags of beans were shipped to Hong Kong, and 775 bags of beans and 2,110 pieces of bean cakes were shipped to Singapore.

### Silk and Tea: Silk's Path Out Relies Only on American Sales

Yesterday's overseas silk market was firm and stable. New York showed no major fluctuations. Yokohama spot goods were down 15 yuan, and forward goods were down 2 yuan. However, it is still 35 yuan higher than the support line, so it is not a cause for concern. In the local silk market, transactions were heard for grade 7 and 8 white silk, priced at $5,225. The sales path to the United States is still grand, but there are only scattered transactions of manual goods.

### North and South Goods: Dried Longan Sees New High Price

Hainan dried longan: Because the source is temporarily blocked, the market is very interested in purchasing. The quoted price has risen rapidly, initially from 190 yuan to 195 yuan, and then broke the 200 yuan mark, reaching a new high price of 205 yuan. As a result, the market price has also tracked and reached 200 yuan.

### Marine Products: Dried Mussels from Ningbo Have a Continuous Source

Since the blockade of Shanghai and Ningbo, navigation has not yet recovered. The marine products from Ningbo only rely on civilian ships for transportation. Therefore, the source of dried mussels from Ningbo has not been cut off. According to the latest information, the quoted price of the original dried mussels is 345 yuan. Dutch cotton white BS mark is 75 yuan, Dutch red is 59.6 yuan, Taikoo car white B mark is 75.6 yuan, DY mark is 73.4 yuan, HX Ka is 73.15 yuan, small 2 yuan to a corner and a half, HM mark is 67 yuan, smaller than before (2nd) small corners. This factory's ice grade 1 is 98.5 yuan, and Jingming ice is 100 yuan, both down 1.5 yuan.

### Hardware: Black Iron Billets Exit the Thousand Yuan Mark, Wire Rods Surge

Yesterday, black iron billets were searched by Tianjin merchants, reaching hundreds of bundles. The local iron printing factories, canning factories, mirror factories, machinery factories, etc. also purchased them, so the market atmosphere was temporarily impacted, and people were in high spirits. Those holding goods thought about reigniting, and the standard soared straight up, re-entering the thousand-yuan mark, more than a hundred yuan higher than before. The quoted price for 30 to 34 thin goods is still around 1,200 yuan.

In recent days, the new wire rod has exceeded the price of Yuan Ding nails and has soared. Currently, Yuan Ding is only shouting 56-57 yuan, while the market price of wire rod has soared to 61-62 yuan. The reason for this is not only that the local nail factories are eagerly searching for construction, but also that the sales path to foreign merchants has also been opened, so there is such a strong phenomenon.

### Notice

Dear Contributors, the remuneration for January has been calculated. Please come to the office in person after 8:00 PM today to pick up the receipts. We will no longer send them. This will allow you to take the receipts to the payment office of the business department from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 7th to collect the payment.

Sincerely, Editorial Department of Commercial News. The price of Danzi is 345 yuan, but the price of big 3-4 gong is still as closed. There is also a lack of inventory.

### Miscellaneous Items: New Prices for Cigarettes

Due to the issue of increased taxes, the price of cigarettes on the unofficial market has been soaring. Yesterday, the new prices were announced. The new price of the Great British brand, managed by Wing Tai Wo Company, is 1,300 yuan. Fifty-stick packs are 1,370 yuan. Old Knife brand is 900 yuan, Pinhai brand is 850 yuan, Guanglu brand is 650 yuan, Hade Men is 650 yuan, Golden is 650 yuan, Wuhua brand is 650 yuan, Little Fairy brand is 650 yuan, Red Seal brand is 650 yuan, and Datai Bridge brand is 830 yuan. There is a shortage of inventory on the market, and the price is expected to rise.

### Coal: Charcoal Prices Soar

Since the Shanghai-Wenzhou line was cut off, no Wenzhou charcoal has arrived. Even those coming from Shenjiamen in the occupied area are also facing obstacles. As a result, the city is running low. The market price is soaring. The high price for Wenzhou grade A charcoal is 15 yuan per dan, but there is no market, and there is no spot. Huangyan charcoal is 12.6 yuan, and small Jiping hat charcoal is 11.2 yuan. The retail price in the local door shop is 2.5 corners per pound.

### Sugar Market: All Sugar Prices Return to Lower Levels

Yesterday, the sugar market trend remained soft. Coarse white sugar was stable, but second-grade and lower grades of white sugar continued to ease. The association's price quotation for existing stock was 24 yuan for coarse white sugar, 78.5 yuan at our own warehouse, 78 yuan for new stock at other warehouses, 76 yuan for old stock from May, and 61 yuan for transshipment goods.

### Blood Transfusion King

— Mo Ming

On July 4, 1935, in Philadelphia, USA, a three-year-old girl named Rosemary was injured in the back by a firecracker set off by a naughty boy. Rosemary's loving aunt, Mrs. McMnllin, immediately rushed her to the hospital. There, her wounds were carefully cleaned, medicated, and injected with a tetanus vaccine. The protection could be said to be comprehensive, but she was still infected by bacteria. Her body temperature soared, eventually rising to 107 degrees; her abdomen swelled up, and her legs swelled like sausages. Doctors discovered that her blood was full of terrible "suppurative Staphylococcus aureus," a bacterium that could not be controlled by any medicine. The doctors shook their heads and told Mrs. McMullin that the child had no hope unless she could find a blood donor who had previously suffered from the same disease.

Mrs. McMullin ran off to pray in disappointment. During her silent prayer, she had a sudden inspiration and came up with an extraordinary idea. She told the doctor, who initially refused this appalling request, but eventually agreed. So, Rosemary's poisoned blood was drawn out, made into a vaccine, and then injected into Mrs. McMullin's blood. She immediately developed the same disease, and at the same time, a large number of sterilized antitoxins were produced in her blood. This blood could be lent to her niece to destroy the bacteria. Within a few days, she gave a total of 29 doses of blood to Rosemary, and this little life was finally snatched back from the clutches of death.

Mrs. McMullin had previously suffered from diphtheria, scarlet fever, rheumatic fever, addiction, streptococcal therapy, and now, with the addition of staphylococcal blood disease, her blood has become a major camp for various antitoxins. In 1937, she heard that a child in Delaware was suffering from severe blood poisoning and was on the verge of death. She immediately rushed there and saved him with one dose of blood transfusion. Later, she was asked to go overnight from her summer travel camp and saved another child. On one occasion, she responded to an emergency call from a dental surgeon and braved a blizzard to fly from Akron to Chicago. On another occasion, she transfused blood to a woman in New York who was suffering from streptococcal endocarditis, and both mother and child were safe.

Her reputation grew larger and larger, and patients hoped that this life-saving Bodhisattva would descend from the sky when the doctors were helpless. She also generously flew around, distributing her precious blood. Sometimes, she was even rushed to two places at the same time, making it difficult for her to cope.

Mrs. McMullin is now calling herself the "Blood Transfusion King." She has donated a total of 200 doses of blood in three years. The loss of such a large amount of blood has not hindered her health in any way. After each blood transfusion, she never felt uncomfortable or had a headache. She does not have strict living and eating conditions, but her weight has increased by 15 pounds in the past three years. She is quite plump and looks very healthy. Only her cheeks are slightly pale, but she can cover it up with rouge.

Her husband, the late William McMullin, enthusiastically supports her life of saving people. He often proudly and incessantly tells people about his wife's story. He is a car salesman who can earn 40 to 50 yuan a week. Therefore, their blood transfusion purpose is not to make money. Mrs. McMullin claims that in the 200 blood transfusions, she has never received a penny of direct remuneration other than the necessary travel expenses. She once said generously: "It is extremely wrong to earn people's money." This noble sacrifice of compassion and selflessness is truly worthy of being written in large characters and praised.

### The Barrier of Life

— Yu Fei

People start living from the moment they come out of their mother's womb. Although some people are saying with their eyes closed that there is no class distinction in this country, there are, after all, differences between rich and poor, noble and humble. Therefore, newborn babies either lie in the white cradles of high-end maternity hospitals, or they sleep in small, simple thatched sheds. The milk they suck, the air they breathe - the beginning of a person's life already has differences in quality.

The life of the rich is about eating well and dressing well. Beyond being well-fed and warm lies lust. Because there is "lust," there are prostitutes, guides, female dancers, female singers, male prostitutes, etc. To intensify the stimulation, there is jazz music, roulette, jai alai, horse racing, dog racing, nude performances, and "folk films"... As prices rise, the "life" of the rich aims at unrestrained consumption, so it seems even more lavish; and their money, although not brought from the umbilical cord, still comes from other places in a steady stream.

The life of the poor is about working from morning till night, from the beginning to the end of the year; the money workers earn every day is only enough to eat large pancakes, not enough to buy rice; farmers still have to rent rice to pay off grain taxes, leaving only a hungry belly. The children they give birth to are only sent to foundling hospitals or abandoned on the side of the road. If they get sick, they cannot afford to see a doctor or take medicine. If someone dies, they can only sleep in a white-board coffin provided by charity. Labor, hunger, poverty, disease, death... All the unfortunate names permeate their lives.

These two completely different kinds of lives are separated by the barrier of the social system. At the same time, the two kinds of lives are linked by relying on this social system. However, people ultimately have a desire to improve their lives; therefore, the rich want to maintain a wealthy life, and the poor want to break through their impoverished lives. When transformed into phenomena, they inevitably take on various forms: the rich say, "A person's poverty or wealth depends on fate." The poor believe this and begin to hate fate. The rich also say, "If you work hard and make progress, when good luck comes, the poor can also become rich!" The poor then believe in fate and work hard to "climb up"; but in fact, they have been greatly fooled, and they are destined to be slaves. They climb, climb, climb, hit a nail, and fall down. Touching the bump on their forehead, they can only lament fate again. After falling a few times, they may gradually understand: if the barrier of the social system is not removed, they will never be able to climb over it.

Our barrier is also intertwined with imperialism and feudal forces. To remove it, we must fight against these two forces.

### Easy Things to Do

— Translated by Wu Jiqi

A young man wrote to me, asking me to find him an easy job. So, I replied, "You cannot be an editor; do not practice law; do not think of being a high official; do not go into business; you should also dislike political science; do not be a doctor; do not be a farmer, soldier, or sailor; and do not read; and do not think. Child, you have already stepped into this difficult reality, and nothing is easy. I know that there is only one place in the world that is incomparably comfortable, and that is the grave." (H.W. Beecher's Response)

Hawthorne's Case

### The Homecoming of the Dancing Queen

— By Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter 8: Two People Caught

Hawthorne leaned back in his chair, clasping his right shin with both hands, his gaze fixed as if in deep thought, and replied, "Still difficult, but maybe there's something. Because this Li Shouqi recently came to Shanghai again and had a chat with Lilan. Are you aware of this?"

Anna shook her head and said, "I don't know. When did he come?"

"He arrived around lunchtime on the seventeenth of the month, stayed at Lilan's house overnight, and supposedly returned to Suzhou early in the morning of the eighteenth."

"Is that so? Why didn't Lilan tell me?"

Hawthorne then asked, "When was the last time you saw Lilan?"

Anna immediately replied, "Yesterday afternoon—around two o'clock. I went to her house to invite her to see the celebrity photo exhibition, but she declined. She didn't mention this matter at that time."

"Did she say anything to you, or did she show any unusual behavior?"

"I felt like she had something on her mind. She was lying on the sofa smoking a cigarette, told me she had a headache, and didn't say much. I asked her about it, but she didn't say anything. So, I didn't sit down for long and came back."

Hawthorne nodded, put down his right leg, and stood up, saying, "Miss Jiang, this matter is very complicated. There are many suspects in the case, and I haven't decided who it is yet. I will do my best. If I can solve it, I will notify you immediately."

Jiang Anna also understood that Hawthorne meant to see her out, so she picked up the blue leather folder on her lap and stood up gracefully. "Alright, thank you, Mr. Hawthorne."

She nodded to us again and was about to turn and walk out the door when Hawthorne called her back.

He said, "Miss Jiang, one more thing. Do you know where Lilan's money comes from?"

Jiang Anna stopped and paused for a moment. "Source of money? Naturally, it's Manager Lu. I know Little Yu doesn't spend money, and Lilan often makes clothes for him instead. That Mr. Zhao doesn't seem to have money either."

Hawthorne nodded. "Alright, I understand. Goodbye."

The sound of Jiang Anna's high heels had just faded out the door when, before I could even open my mouth to discuss this new development in the case with Hawthorne, Shi Gui suddenly ushered in two more people. One was Xu San, Ni Jinshou's assistant, and behind him was Yu Gantang. (127)

### ### Shirley Temple's Whereabouts After Leaving the Film World

— By Qinghui

Shirley Temple, who had dominated the film world for many years, has finally bid us farewell. Many people are nostalgic and eager to know about her life after leaving the film world. Now, according to foreign newspapers and magazines, a brief introduction is as follows:

Lovable

In appearance, Shirley hasn't changed much. She still has those curly hairs, but they are combed more neatly. Those two bright, black eyes, deep dimples, and a face as round and delicate as an apple, she is still a lovable child, kind and interesting, revealing childlike innocence and liveliness. At school, Shirley has a small difficulty, which is that her wealth invisibly isolates her from other children. She learned their ways, wore the same clothes as them, and was able to play with them, but she was still often unconsciously discovered to be different from them in terms of class status. Shirley was very troubled by this. She is quite interested in various outdoor sports, especially volleyball; her traces are often found in the library, and her favorite readings are biographies and anecdotes of celebrities; she studies diligently in the whole class, and although her grades are not amazing, her French and history are both excellent. She is also an experienced speaker, and in just a few months, she has won two speech competition awards.

King of Treats

Shirley is very generous. When she plays with her classmates, she is always the host, so she has the reputation of being the "King of Treats" among her companions. She often invites a few classmates to her home for a small tea party, sometimes studying loudly or playing volleyball, and when it's hot, going swimming.

She is, after all, a remarkable child prodigy. When she is in class, she listens attentively to the teacher's explanations; but after class, she squats next to the teacher, sits quietly for hours, without a word, or sometimes takes a walk to the open space, building a small bridge over a small ditch, or doing some childish things, even hitting the teacher a few times, but the teacher does not feel disgusted.

She often crosses her legs, chewing on pastries, and telling her classmates about her travels. Her experience is richer than that of an average adult. The most amazing thing is that everything seems ordinary to her. She believes that home is the most precious place in the world. Walking and chatting side by side with the country is not as fun as playing with naughty children. After Shirley left the film world, many people wanted to take the opportunity to seize her position, but like Valentino, her type cannot be filled by anyone else. Although she has left the film world, the letters sent from all over the world have not decreased. It is enough to show the audience's passionate love for her.

### ### Bai Yang Stars in "Youth of China"

— By Haixing

The youth of the isolated island fought on the front lines, in the rear, and in the heart of the motherland for three years! This should be a passionate heroic song. Playwright Yang Hansheng hopes to reflect this fact with a film and has written the screenplay for the film "Youth of China," which is now being directed by Su Yi of the China Film Studio, starring Bai Yang, Wei Heling, and Tao Yu. Yang Weiyun, the cinematographer from the Grand Hall of the Isolated Island, is in charge of filming.

Bai Yang was originally playing the lead role in the "Central One's" "Long Sky Miles," but because "Long Sky Miles" borrowed an outdoor photography studio from a "Chinese" suburb for filming, and the interior scenes were still being rushed to build, Bai Yang's outdoor work in "Youth of China" has already begun, and it is expected to be completed in four months.

"Youth of China" is a heroic song, an epic, and even more a mirror for young people! Telling you; the truth of the saying "China is the China of the Youth"!

### ### Qilin Tong Still Needs Rest

— By Yixing

Carlton Invites Shang Heyu

Qilin Shi, the president of the Yifeng Society, followed doctor's orders and decided to continue resting, so the day of Carlton's reopening is still far away. In order to maintain the livelihood of the backstage team, Carlton's management once considered inviting Huang Guiqiu or Zhang Yipeng to temporarily fill the gap, but both failed for various reasons. It is now learned that someone has been entrusted to invite Shang Heyu to the south for a short-term performance. Shang is an old performer of Peking opera, specializing in martial roles and excelling in short plays. He and the late Yang Xiaolou were known as the best. Although he is old, his waist and legs are still strong. In recent years, he often reappeared on stage with Shi Huibao, Xiao Changhua, Cheng Jixian, and others under the banner of the "Five Elders Association," and still gained praise. It is said that Shang Heyu is asking for eight thousand yuan, which is currently being negotiated. If it is successful, he will bring one sheng (male lead) and one dan (female lead). The painted-face role may be Guan Shaohua. As for Gao Baisui and Wang Xichun of the Yifeng Society, they will take a temporary break during this short period.

### Little Sheng

Among the little sheng roles, Xu Xiaoxiang and below, Wang Guiguan, Lu Huaying, Zhu Suyun, De Junru, Cheng Lianxi, Jiang Miaoxiang, Jin Zhongren, Wang Youquan, Yu Zhenfei, etc., each got two level tones. The rising stars Ye Sheng'lan and Jiang Shiyu each got one level tone. Only Gao Weilian, with three characters and three level tones, has a very good voice and a tall stature. Please wait and see his future achievements to prove my point?

Among the martial sheng roles, the Yang father and son (Yuelou, Xiaolou, Jucheng, Zhenting) each got two level tones. Shang Heyu only has one level tone in the character "He." His art is comparable to Xiaolou, but his fate is not as good. The rising stars Gao (Shenglin), Wu (Yanheng), Yang (Shengchun), and Sun (Yukun) each got two level tones, so their art is equal and their names are equally known. There is even one Liu Zongyang with all three characters being level tones, but he is weak and lacks ambition. He is stuck in the yin level tone of the character "Zong." Compared to a fortune-telling sign, it is a medium sign. If he is willing to work hard in time, he can be successful in the future. (The three characters of Liu Zongyang have the same pattern as the three characters of Tan Xinpei, all being yang-yin-yang. This pattern is rare. The old Tan was not successful until he was in his thirties or forties, and he was extremely good in his old age.) There are very few old dan roles, such as Gong Yunfu, Wen Liangchen, and Li Duokui, all with two level tones. Wo Yun Jushi has two level tones in the four characters. The female old dan Zhang Shaoquan also has two level tones. Also, stage names like Yuanyuanhong (the original name of the bangzi old sheng Guo Baozhen, there is also a Little Yuanyuanhong) and Qilin Tong (Zhou Xinfang's original name) all have three yang level tones, so they can become famous in the opera world and establish their own style. I have verified this with many realities. The stage name with the most level tones is bound to have good luck. It is not a false statement. Only those with two yang and one yin in the middle, like Tan Xinpei, are the first class. Those with two yang on top and one yin below, like Mei Lanfang and Wang Yaoqing, are the second class. Those with three level tones all being yang, like Wang Quankui, Wang Changlin, and Wang Helin, are the third class. Those with one yin on top and two yang below, like Xiao Changhua and Gao Weilian, are another category. Names with only two level tones have the two ends being yang as the highest class, like Yu Shuyan, Yan Jupeng, and Wang Youchen. The next class has yang first and yin below, like Tan Fuyang, Yang Shisen, and Wu Suqiu. The next class has yin first and yang below, like Gao Qingkui and Wang Xiaonong. Those with both ends being yin are the next best, like Jin Shaoshan, Zhou Xiaotian, and Xin Yanqiu. Even my name, if I were to go into opera, I would have to change one or two characters, because the characters "Su" and "Qing," which are at both ends, are both yin level tones. This kind of pattern, even if you don't run errands, you will do the work. If compared to the official rank of the late Qing Dynasty, it would be in the unranked ninth rank. The salary received would be no more than five dou of rice, and the official name would be a kowtowing insect! If I change the middle oblique tone character "Shao" to the yang level tone character "Shao" (the character "Shao" has both level and falling tones), and change it to three level tones, I can be promoted several ranks. (A fortune teller named Yuan also looks at people's names to determine their fate. He doesn't talk about level tones, but looks at the shape of the characters. He roughly says that characters like "Xiao" (small) mean a small head and a small face, which is not generous. The character "Shao" (less) is even worse than the character "Xiao," because the character "Xiao" still stands there properly, while the character "Shao" is the character "Xiao" kicking its feet.) So, my character "Shao" must be changed. I will choose an auspicious day to change it. (The End)
