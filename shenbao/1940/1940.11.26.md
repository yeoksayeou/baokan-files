### The Situation Between Thailand and Vietnam Is Gradually Becoming Tense: Rumor That Thai Troops Tried to Invade Cambodia and Were Repelled by French Troops; Bangkok Police Department Forbids the Publication of Military Activity News

Bangkok: This police department, in view of the increasingly tense recent crisis, has issued an order forbidding the publication of news regarding Thai military activities. The ban on news of Thai troops' activities on the border is strictly enforced. The French Embassy Counselor here, Garreau, is currently in Vietnam in discussions with the Governor of Vietnam. He is expected to return to Bangkok on Wednesday. (Reuters, 25th)

Hanoi: A team of Thai soldiers attempted to cross the river at Lower Yabe last night to enter the territory of the French protectorate Kingdom of Cambodia but were repelled by the defense forces. Both sides exchanged gunfire at that time. The authorities have already launched an investigation into the matter. (Havas, 24th)

Hanoi: The French authorities have recently begun to investigate the border incidents of Saturday night and Sunday, when French troops forced back Thai troops attempting to cross the river. The Vietnamese government stated that Thai troops had entered Cambodia, and there was fighting between the two sides before the Thai troops withdrew. (Reuters, 25th)

### Japan's Demands to Vietnam: Control of Saigon Customs; American Cargo Ship Sets Sail from Haiphong; Cargo Confiscated After Being Detained by Vietnam

Chongqing: The Central Daily News reported today that the main new demands made by Japan to the Vietnamese government are as follows: (1) Japan will purchase all of Vietnam's rubber production from December onwards; (2) Japan has the exclusive right to develop Vietnam's natural resources; (3) Japan will control Vietnam's customs. The third demand was subsequently withdrawn by the Japanese side, and now it is advocating control of Saigon's customs. It is reported that the issue of controlling Vietnam's customs has led to disputes over the transfer of two patrol ships carrying American goods left in Vietnam. These two ships are the "Torbay" and the "West River." It is said that the oil stored in Vietnam by American and Texaco companies is worth as much as US$1 million. The authorities have permitted the "Torbay" to load 2,300 barrels of oil and depart from Vietnam for Hong Kong. The cargo stored in Haiphong by the Far East Trading Company will be transferred by the "West River." As the two American ships were preparing to set sail from Haiphong, Japanese officials forced the Vietnamese authorities to detain them, unload the cargo, and then found gas masks in the ship. Japan claimed that the contents of the ship were automotive supplies and confiscated everything. It is also said that there is a strong movement in southern Vietnam supporting Tagore, but it lacks leadership. The Japanese side may use this movement as an excuse to occupy Saigon. Vietnamese armed forces currently stationed in Saigon account for 80% of the total. It is also heard that the Vietnamese authorities are busily deploying land and air defenses near Zhennanguan to guard against unforeseen events. (Reuters, 25th)

Hanoi: An official announcement stated that police stations in the northern and western suburbs of Saigon, Wanggelintai, Niu, and Ganggelong, along with several local government offices, were suddenly attacked by armed bandits on the night of the 22nd of this month, resulting in several indigenous policemen being killed or injured. After receiving the alert, the military and political authorities immediately dispatched troops to suppress the situation, quickly restoring order and capturing several bandits. It is rumored that these bandits were instigated by communists. No incidents occurred in Saigon City and the nearby city of Di'an. It is only heard that a French person was attacked by bandits while driving, and details are pending investigation. (Havas, 24th)

Tokyo: According to Japanese sources in Hanoi, on the night of November 25th, armed Annamese people rioted near Saigon and surrounded several Vietnamese garrison teams, but they have been captured. According to an official statement, this riot was instigated by Communist elements. (Reuters, 25th)

Hong Kong: Today, news from Japanese sources in Hanoi was received here stating that on the 22nd of this month, armed Annamese people surrounded the Vietnamese garrison in Saigon and threatened to riot. It is rumored that these armed Annamese people have been arrested by the Vietnamese garrison. The news stated that the Vietnamese government issued a statement blaming the actions of these armed Annamese people on the recent instigation by "Communist secret agents." (Reuters, 25th)

Hong Kong: In order to cut off China's supplies obtained via the Burma Road, Japan seems to have signs of plotting against Burma. Although this move has not yet been confirmed, judging from the concentration of Japanese troops in Vietnam and Hainan Island, it seems to be the trend. According to reliable Chinese sources, in addition to the 5th and 28th Divisions, there is another division of Japanese troops in Vietnam, the details of which are unknown. The former two divisions were transferred from Guangxi and are rumored to be the elite of the Japanese army. The guards dispatched from Tokyo to Guangxi a year ago have been transferred to Hainan Island. The army is also known as the Konoe Division and is said to be famous for its strict discipline and bravery. French sources say that Vietnam has 600 Japanese aircraft, ready to continue bombing Kunming and the Burma Road. Japan claims that French people in Saigon are anti-Japanese and pro-British, which shows that Japan intends to land troops in Saigon. Saigon is very close to Thailand and Burma. Foreign activists in Singapore and Saigon are closely watching the development of the situation. In any case, the concentration of Japanese troops in Vietnam and Hainan Island is intended to take action overseas in the future. According to knowledgeable sources, the Japanese army withdrew from Guangxi and southwestern Guangdong for this reason. Hanoi news said that the French are quite resentful of the Japanese army's entry into Vietnam and are friendly with Chongqing. (International Telegram, 25th)

Manila: According to Japanese sources in Hanoi, the Japanese military authorities will protest to the American consulate in Hanoi tomorrow regarding the actions of Reuters reporter Jackobey and U.S. Vice Consul Linton in taking photos of the Japanese military depot. It is also said that the Vietnamese government has decided to order the expulsion of Jackobey. The Japanese authorities have also issued a statement in Hanoi today, claiming that the actions of the American reporter are espionage. (Reuters, 25th)

Tokyo: The "Nichi Nichi Shimbun" published a report from Hanoi stating that Vietnamese Governor-General Decoux issued an order yesterday to arrest three senior officials because they were suspected of sympathizing with General de Gaulle, who opposed the Petain government. Several other officials whose attitude towards the Vichy government is ambiguous may also be arrested. (Haitong, 25th)

Tokyo: When the Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman met with reporters today, he was asked about the detention of U.S. Vice Consul Linton and American journalist Jacobey in Haiphong by Japanese officials on November 21. The spokesman replied that the two were arrested because Jacobey photographed the Japanese military camp and were then handed over to French officials. When asked whether the two were still in custody, the spokesman replied that according to the latest news, the two were still in custody. When asked if the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo had taken any action regarding this matter, the spokesman replied that he did not think there would be any action and said that the case was very simple and hoped that it could be resolved locally.

### Rumor That the Japanese Side Intends to Launch a Large-Scale Attack on Chongqing

Lashio: A well-informed European authority recently told a Reuters reporter on a Douglas aircraft that the Japanese are currently concentrating their troops and military supplies and are extremely busy preparing to launch a large-scale offensive in an attempt to attack Chongqing in one fell swoop. The Japanese have now concentrated a large number of troops in Hankou. Judging from the situation, it seems that Hankou is the main base for the general westward offensive. The Japanese troops currently concentrated in Hankou, in addition to a large number of infantry divisions, also have mechanized units and chemical units. In addition, the Japanese army has also transported a large number of heavy bombers from Hanoi to Hankou, and the various divisions of the Japanese army that recently withdrew from Nanning have also been sent to Hankou to prepare to participate in the future general offensive against Chongqing.

### Central Joint Memorial Week: Sun Ke Speaks on Economic Policy: Implementing the Revolutionary Economic Policy of the Premier Can Solve Financial, Food and Other Problems

Chongqing: At 8:00 a.m. on the 25th, the Central Joint Memorial Week was held in the National Government. More than 300 members of the Central Committee and staff from political and military agencies attended. Chairman Lin led the ceremony, and President Sun delivered a speech, stating that in 1935, the National Government decided to implement the legal tender policy, which was the realization of the Premier's legacy (the currency revolution). Without the implementation of the legal tender policy, there would have been no way to support this great war from 1937 to the present. It can be seen that only by following the Premier's legacy can the current financial and economic problems be solved. However, it must be known that the Premier's economic policy is a whole, and it must be implemented step by step in order to promote smooth progress, and the national economy and people's livelihood will benefit from it. I would like to select several major instructions from the Premier's legacy regarding economic policy: (1) Monetary policy, which is the legal tender policy that we have implemented in recent years, can be said to have been completely successful. The economic strength of the past 40 months of strong combat has depended on this. (2) Food policy, which advocates that food must be thoroughly managed by the government and that public sales should be implemented because food is not comparable to ordinary commodities and cannot be allowed to freely increase prices in the market, hindering people's livelihood. This food policy, in light of the current irrational rise in food prices, shows that it has reached the time for concrete implementation and cannot be hesitated any longer. (3) Land policy, which advocates equal land rights, and the method of its implementation is to start with preliminary land reports, then implement land value tax and purchase at the assessed price, and then implement nationalization of land. Our country is a country that is established on agriculture. If we want to thoroughly solve the financial and economic problems in the future, we must pay full attention to the land issue and implement the Premier's land policy. In short, if we want to stabilize the prices of food and general goods, and if we want to balance the state's financial revenue and expenditure, we must go beyond the legal tender policy and further engage in large-scale source opening. The method of opening sources is to thoroughly and universally manage food, or even implement public sales of food, and thoroughly implement the policy of equal land rights. Then the income from land will be the income of the state, and food will no longer be a commodity that can be manipulated and profited from by private individuals. On the one hand, public sales can be used to stabilize food prices. On the one hand, the income from public sales can also be the largest source of income for all state undertakings. The Soviet Union was originally an agricultural country. After the revolution, it stipulated the nationalization of land and implemented the New Economic Policy, and has now become a first-class power. Not only has agriculture progressed, but it has also become an industrial country. This is a significant result. However, this kind of finance is revolutionary finance, and this kind of economic policy is revolutionary economic policy. Without revolutionary spirit, it cannot be implemented. We should deeply understand the Premier's greatness and the foresight of his revelations. Based on the legacy, implement revolutionary economic policies, then not only the current food problem can be thoroughly solved, but the state's financial problems in the future can also be smoothly solved from this point on. (Telegram, 25th)

Chongqing: President of the Legislative Yuan Sun Ke recently spoke at the Central Party Department's Memorial Week, saying that government control of rice and public sales of rice are methods to solve the recent food panic and are also elements to solve future economic problems. The government is now working hard to solve the rice problem, deciding to maintain a rice price of 60 yuan per dan (the market price is 180 yuan per dan), and should implement the control policy without hesitation, and said that this policy is in line with the principles of Sun Yat-sen's economic policy.

### Abbreviated Names Not Allowed for Agencies

Chongqing: The Supreme National Defense Council believes that the names of various agencies, as well as people's names and place names, are often misused, affecting administrative efficiency. It has been decided that in the future, when agencies issue documents, the names of agencies at all levels, as well as people's names and place names, must be recorded in full and abbreviated names should not be used, so as to avoid confusion. The National Government has issued an order to all agencies nationwide to comply with this requirement. (Telegram, 25th)

### Japan's Price Control Policy Fails: Prices of Agricultural Products Soar

Tokyo: According to a report published by the Imperial Agricultural Association in the "Asahi Shimbun", the Japanese government's policy of suppressing prices has failed to prevent the price increase of various agricultural products and household goods. Therefore, this policy cannot but be regarded as a failure. The Imperial Agricultural Association Dongzhuan Committee is currently trying to balance the prices of agricultural products with the daily necessities of farmers and has investigated prices in 45 cities and villages across the country to understand that all agricultural products, except rice, have increased in price, and the various items needed by farmers are extremely expensive. There is a world of difference in the price of rice, which is the basis of farmers' livelihoods. In August of this year, only chemical fertilizers were cheaper than rice, while other agricultural products were not balanced. Taking the average price of daily necessities in 1937 as a standard, all prices have increased, and the defect is deepening day by day. The reason for this is the failure of the government's policy of suppressing prices. (Havas, 24th)

Editorial

### Japan's Transformation

Yesterday's news: Japan's so-called elite Konoe Division was recently transferred to Hainan Island in China, and more than two divisions of troops and 600 aircraft were concentrated in French Indochina. According to one source, in order to cut off China's supplies obtained through Burma, Japan will send troops to land in Saigon and launch an attack on British Burma. To the general public, these are no longer regarded as unusual news. For weeks, it has been rumored that (1) Thailand is strongly demanding French Indochina to cede territory and does not hesitate to resolve the issue by force; (2) armed conflicts have occurred between Thailand and Vietnam; (3) pro-British elements are active in Saigon, brewing a revolution against Vietnamese Governor-General Decoux; (4) Decoux is uneasy in his position and has resigned; (5) many Japanese warships and transports are anchored outside Saigon. The sources of these rumors are mostly Tokyo, and Japanese newspapers and news agencies have tried their best to promote and publish these kinds of rumors. Therefore, there is no need to question the existence of facts or the authenticity of the rumors, but they are enough to highlight Japan's intentions in that regard.

"No one can speculate on events that may occur in the Far East a few hours in advance," this was U.S. President Roosevelt's response yesterday to inquiries from reporters. He avoided making any clear indications, only hinting at the seriousness and tension in the Far East. Because he is the head of the United States, shouldering the heavy responsibilities of the present, even if he has accurate information, he cannot divulge it rashly, let alone make any speculations. However, those who are concerned about the evolution of the Far East can easily study the future trends based on the situation in all parties. It should be known that Japan has suffered a complete diplomatic failure, and diplomacy is ultimately only a link in the overall politics. This newspaper's editorial has already explained this in detail yesterday. Although it once regarded the so-called "resolution of the China Incident" as the main national policy for a time, its ambition for southward expansion could not be restrained due to the encouragement of the European war. Although it has consumed most of its national power in the consuming strategy in China, it still boasts its largely undamaged navy as a powerful capital for international speculation. Therefore, its "main national policy for a time" has now gradually transformed and is only a part of its national policy. In other words, it initially hoped for an immediate resolution of the so-called China Incident, but now that it knows that coercion and inducement are ineffective and a resolution is difficult to achieve, it has placed southward expansion in the first place in its future actions. The conceivable motives for this transformation: First, southward expansion wants to take advantage of people's danger, and believes that the present is a good opportunity for southward expansion. Fearing that the good opportunity is difficult to obtain and will pass quickly, it believes that if it does not act now, when will it? Second, after fighting with China for 40 months, it temporarily abandoned the idea of further confronting the Soviet Union in light of its own land and air strength, and changed its plan to make southward expansion the basis for seeking a compromise with the Soviet Union, so as to reduce its defense expenditure on the Soviet Union. Third, if southward expansion is successful, it will isolate China from Europe and the United States, forming a large encirclement of China. Although the so-called China Incident cannot be resolved urgently at present, the success of southward expansion will lay the foundation for a better situation for cleaning up China. Fourth, the harvest of southward expansion is that not only is the cultural level of the natives of Southeast Asia far inferior to that of China, so it is not difficult to conquer Southeast Asia and use it for its own purposes as long as the European and American forces are expelled. Moreover, the natural environment of Southeast Asia is more suitable for Japanese colonization, and the material resources of Southeast Asia are better resources for competing with Europe and the United States. Driven by these four motives, in terms of military action, the military force used in China will be moved southwards. In terms of politics, it will take measures that are unable to resolve the Sino-Japanese War but only seek to protect its military occupation areas in China. In terms of diplomacy, because southward expansion will inevitably conflict with Britain and the United States, it will disregard Britain and the United States and directly ally with Germany and Italy and curry favor with the Soviet Union. Among them, it must be especially pointed out and emphasized that Japan currently places southward expansion in the first place in its national policy. The significance of this is by no means to relax on China. On the contrary, it should be known that this is to tighten the encirclement of China from the outside. Among them, it must be especially pointed out that what remains for all parties to realize is that the Japanese Foreign Minister's revelation to the U.S. Ambassador a week ago about seeking peace directly with the Chinese National Government was, in addition to testing China and deceiving the United States, intimidating Nanjing politically. And the "signing in Nanjing on the 30th of this month", which was rumored yesterday, is the end of the test and deception proving to be ineffective. There is no need to take this too seriously as Japan's further political offensive. On the contrary, it should be known that this is a temporary end to the political offensive and a shift to a defensive position.

Japan's southward expansion, which is currently in the first place in its national policy, is arranging its first post for southward expansion in Vietnam. It will inevitably take some action in Saigon, the source of France's control of Vietnam. What is unknown is how to make excuses for the action and what form it will take. We still remember that when it—on the pretext of passing through Vietnam to attack China, coerced and induced the French to sign an agreement, we once revealed that it actually had three goals: one was against China, the other was to seize Vietnam itself, and the third was to demonstrate and coerce Britain. Subsequent facts, up to the current situation, not only prove that what we revealed was true, but also explain that the rumored "sending a motorcade to land in Saigon" or the original intention of other actions in Saigon. It will further expand its goals to British Burma with the same meaning, the same methods, and the same ways. This is the explanation of the rumored "in order to cut off China's supplies obtained through Burma, plotting to attack Burma." In short, it has already embarked on the road of southward expansion in the mist.

### Reportedly, the U.S. Will Invite the United Kingdom to Participate in American Economic Cooperation; Roosevelt Will Focus Efforts on Expanding Aid to Britain; The U.S. Temporarily Abandons Freezing Credit Loans to Belligerent Nations

Washington: President Roosevelt has recently returned from Hyde Park. It is expected that the President will spend most of this week focusing on two issues: increasing aid to Britain and the economic relationship between the United States and Argentina. The British Ambassador to the United States, Lord Lothian, may meet with the President this week. (United Press dispatch, 25th)

Washington: Reliable sources stated yesterday that the U.S. may invite the United Kingdom to participate in American economic defense cooperation. It is expected that the Pan-American Economic Committee may invite the United Kingdom to join the cocoa agreement. The Pan-American countries will conclude a cocoa agreement to maintain cocoa prices. Currently, various countries are also attempting to conclude a similar agreement for coffee. (United Press dispatch, 25th)

New York: Granting loans to Britain has become a subject of discussion in various circles in the United States. The "New York Telegram" reported from Washington that Senator King stated that he would ask the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to approve his proposed amendment to the Johnson Act and to pass measures to fund the procurement of American agricultural products by Britain, so that loans could be provided to the United Kingdom. The new chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, George, said that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee might not be able to handle it this way, because during this congressional term, it may not be easy for Congress to obtain a statutory majority for any issue that may cause controversy. However, if the international situation becomes more serious, he can find a way to get Congress to act quickly. Chairman Bloom of the House Foreign Affairs Committee suggested that the most practical and satisfactory way for all parties would be for the British to submit a loan request, with a clear statement of its intended use. The remarks made by the British Ambassador to the United States, Lord Lothian, have led to further discussion about the centralized management of various American securities reported by Americans, so as to maintain market prices and prevent price reductions. He believes that the United States may receive these securities as collateral for government loans. The "New York Telegram" also stated that British Ambassador Lord Lothian is scheduled to meet with President Roosevelt today. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)

Washington: Regarding the Treasury Department's plan, ordered by the White House, to consider freezing credit loans to belligerent nations, informed sources now say that it has been temporarily abandoned. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 25th)

Washington: Reliable sources stated yesterday that the United States is currently considering not only freezing the deposits of Germany and Italy but also freezing all deposits of the United Kingdom that are detrimental to relevant people. It is also said that the move to freeze American deposits is currently in the discussion stage. In the past, the freezing of deposits was only applied to countries occupied by Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union. Now the United States plans to place the deposits of the major belligerent nations, totaling US$3.5 billion, under the strict supervision of the Treasury Department, and control the movement of these deposits based on a licensing system. This restriction may be applied to Britain, Germany, and Italy to show that there is no discrimination. However, the purchase of British military equipment will not be hindered. The Treasury Department will promptly respond to Britain's applications for licenses. It is reported that the proposal to freeze British deposits has the approval of Roosevelt, and this idea has arisen from the general expectation that the Johnson Act may be amended. The Johnson Act stipulates that countries that have not repaid war debts owed to the United States from the previous European war will not be granted loans again. Chairman Bloom of the House Foreign Affairs Committee said that we should know that Britain does not need money, but only wants to purchase military supplies on credit. We should find out what Britain needs so that we can increase appropriate credit sales. If Britain needs airplanes worth 100 million yuan, then Britain's acquisition of these airplanes must be through a form of credit rather than a monetary loan. Granting Britain credit for this does not conflict with the Johnson Act. (United Press dispatch, 25th)

Washington: News today indicates that the United States will allow Britain to receive the new PBY-5 long-range patrol bombers manufactured by the Consolidated Aircraft Corporation in the first batch of deliveries. These aircraft are currently being manufactured. The aircraft factory has now built 400 of these aircraft, with half going to the U.S. and half going to Britain, Australia, and Canada. However, this move by the United States is a separate matter from the recent discussion between Britain and the U.S. Army about transporting "Flying Fortresses" to Britain. (United Press dispatch, 25th)

Tokyo: This morning's "China and Foreign Commercial News" reported that Britain and the United States are preparing to take action in the Pacific region. Although there is no reliable information revealing the truth, the Japanese authorities should be vigilant and closely monitor the activities of Britain and the United States in the South China Sea so that they can be prepared. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 25th)

New York: The "New York Tribune" published a report from London stating that Britain is considering exchanging British territories in the West Indies for American munitions and military supplies. The newspaper's editorial advised the United States to provide financial assistance to Britain so that it can continue to resist the war. To aid Britain, this is the only way; otherwise, aid will not be effective. The "New York Times" has a similar viewpoint, stating that Britain is in dire need of financial assistance, which private individuals cannot handle. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 25th)

### The Possibility of an Alliance Between Britain and the United States Exists; U.S. Senator King Proposes Lending to Britain and Greece

Tokyo: Rear Admiral Soza wrote an article in a Japanese magazine stating that the U.S. preparations for war "are quite serious because they conflict with Japan's plan to establish a new order in Greater Asia." Rear Admiral Soza also strongly stated that there is a possibility of an alliance between Britain and the United States. It is said that the military alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan "may cause the United States to reconsider its attitude towards the current war." Rear Admiral Soza also criticized Britain and the United States, saying that Britain and the United States' aid to China and the application of economic pressure on Japan are aimed at strengthening the anti-totalitarian camp. (International News Service dispatch, 25th)

Washington: U.S. Democratic Senator William King of Utah expressed his support in the Senate yesterday for lending to Britain and Greece because those two countries are fighting for the interests of the United States. King proposed amending the Johnson Act and the Neutrality Act, which prohibit lending to countries that have not cleared their previous debts. According to responsible authorities, it is not known whether the Senate will adopt this proposal, as it will depend on whether President Roosevelt supports it. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 25th)

### U.S. Ambassador to Germany, Wilson, Will Retire

Washington: Wilson, who was appointed as the U.S. Ambassador to Germany in January 1938, will retire at the end of the year. He was recalled by the government for consultation in November 1938 and has not returned to his post since then. He announced his resignation in October of the following year.

### U.S. Navy Secretary Strongly Advocates Establishing Two-Ocean Fleet; U.S. Adoption of Naval Aviation Strategy Has Proven Effective in War

Washington: U.S. Navy Secretary Knox stated in his military report to President Roosevelt that the American people may have complete trust in their fleet, but it is dangerous if there is no two-ocean navy. It would be wrong not to prepare a two-ocean navy when we have the manpower and resources to do so. Knox also mentioned the European war, saying that many of the main principles of the U.S.'s long-adopted naval aviation strategy have now proven effective in overseas wars. Knox reported on the progress of the construction of new naval aviation bases in Alaska, the central Pacific, and the continental United States. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)

### National Funeral Next Month After Saionji's Death; Chongqing Public Opinion Generally Praises His Achievements

Chongqing: After the death of Japan's last surviving elder, Saionji, public opinion here generally praised his achievements and expressed condolences for his death. It was also pointed out that several policies advocated by Saionji were beneficial to China. The "Ta Kung Pao" stated that when the Republic of China was first established, radical Japanese military personnel attempted to support Puyi and intervene, but this was not successful due to Saionji's opposition. This action was thus delayed for more than a decade. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 25th)

### Bulgaria Will Also Join the Axis Pact; Bulgarian Delegation Departs for Berlin

Berlin: It is reported that a Bulgarian delegation departed for Berlin yesterday, with the task of potentially following in the footsteps of Hungary, Romania and Slovakia to join the Axis Alliance. If this were to materialize, Germany would gain a direct route to the Turkish border, only a hundred miles away from the Dardanelles Strait. Furthermore, all countries in Southeast Europe, except for war-torn Greece, would then be dominated by the Axis powers, even Yugoslavia would be surrounded. (United Press dispatch, 25th)

Berlin: German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop hosted a banquet at the Hotel Adlon at 2 p.m. yesterday to welcome Slovak Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Professor Tuka.

Turkey's Intensified Vigilance Sufficient to Discourage Germany and Italy

Ankara: While Hitler's recent diplomatic maneuvers have allowed Germany and Italy to control various European countries unable to make their own decisions, Turkey remains unmoved. Bulgaria's attitude remains unclear. However, according to indirect news, King Boris of Bulgaria did not make any binding promises during his conversation with Hitler at Berchtesgaden at the end of last week. It is said that Hitler pointed out the value of allying with Germany under the current circumstances and the opportunity for Bulgaria to claim Greek territory. However, Boris replied that small countries like Bulgaria are unable to participate in wars between major powers. According to the general opinion in Ankara, Yugoslavia will also resist the pressure from the Axis powers. However, the development of the international situation is difficult to predict, so Turkey is determined not to take unprepared risks. In addition to martial law in the Straits area, it will take other military measures aimed at continuously strengthening its preparations. Furthermore, it has mobilized a large army, the numbers of which are increasing rapidly. People here hope that Turkey's vigilance will discourage the Axis powers from presenting a short-term ultimatum and will allow Bulgaria to maintain its sanity. Whether this hope is realized or not, the Axis powers have no doubt about Turkey's determination to deal with contingencies. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)

Southern Country Makes Efforts to Resist Pressure from Axis Powers

London: A Reuters diplomatic correspondent reports that there are rumors that Bulgarian Prime Minister Filov and Foreign Minister Popov will be going to Berlin soon. The Axis powers are spreading rumors that Bulgaria will join their alliance. The Italian newspaper "Il Popolo d'Italia" claims that Bulgaria has already positioned itself on the side of the Axis powers, not as a neutral country, but as a non-belligerent country. This statement is probably premature, because even if Bulgaria is forced to join the "New Order" due to threats, it does not necessarily mean that Germany can immediately use Bulgaria as a corridor to send troops to aid Italy. Turkey has already made its attitude clear regarding the passage of German troops through Bulgaria. The precautionary measures taken by Turkey recently indicate that it is fully prepared to defend its vital interests. The signing of the Tripartite Pact by Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia has not created significant military changes in the situation. The various intentions and hopes that the Nazis had after Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's visit to Germany have not achieved much diplomatic success. The only countries currently inclined towards the Axis powers are three small countries that are already under the complete control of Nazi power or Nazi troops. At the same time, Yugoslavia, seeing the defeat of Italian troops in Greece, is now resisting the pressure from the Axis powers with increased vigor. If Italy invades, Yugoslavia will inevitably engage in war. If Germany helps Italy to coerce Yugoslavia, Yugoslavia will certainly regard it as serious, but it will not necessarily bow down and accept the constraints of the Axis powers. The attitude of the Soviet Union remains ambiguous. Moscow is also maintaining a deliberate silence regarding the change of its ambassador to Berlin. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)

### Bulgaria Demands Return of Southern Serbian Region from Yugoslavia; Situation in the Balkans Worsens

Belgrade, Yugoslavia: Bulgarian National Party member Dumanov recently delivered a speech in the Bulgarian National Assembly, involving the issue of Bulgaria demanding the return of the southern Serbian region from Yugoslavia. Yugoslav public opinion and the press were extremely indignant upon hearing the news, and the situation in the Balkans is becoming increasingly tense. Many newspapers here are using headlines such as "Dumanov's provocation" or "Where is Bulgaria going?" Among them, the "Times" is refuting Dumanov's remarks with the title "Macedonia is not comparable to Dobruja," and strongly stating that the people of Yugoslavia are determined to defend the integrity of their territory and are willing to make any major sacrifice. The semi-official "Political Daily" reported that Bulgarian newspapers have recently published articles with a warlike tone, even accusing Yugoslavia of being "an enemy of Germany and Italy." Bulgaria and Yugoslavia signed the Briand-Kellogg Pact in 1930 and a treaty of friendship in 1937, repeatedly declaring the need to maintain peace in the Balkan Peninsula. Bulgaria's actions are in conflict with the aforementioned two treaties. (Havas dispatch, 24th)

### Greek Forces Penetrate Albanian Territory, Continue to Occupy the Important Town of Pogradec; Italian Division Annihilated; New Zealand Troops Arrive in Greece

Athens: The victorious Greek forces, undeterred by the numerical superiority of the Italian army, completed their third day of general offensive yesterday, penetrating deep into Albanian territory and capturing several important cities at both ends of the 120-mile front. After occupying Konitsa in the south, the Greek forces advanced towards Argyrokastro and Santi Quaranta. According to unconfirmed reports, Greek forces have reached the outskirts of Argyrokastro and are engaged in close combat with the Italian army. Greek wireless messages claim that Greek forces in the north have occupied Moscopole, 15 miles northwest of Korçë, bringing the advancing Greek forces within 20 miles of Pogradec, an important central area of the front and a major Italian base. Pogradec appears to be the second target of the Greek offensive. Greek sources from the front claim that the Italian army has abandoned Pogradec, allowing Greek forces to enter the city, but this news has yet to be confirmed. (International Telegram, 25th)

Athens: According to reliable sources here last night, powerful Greek forces entered Pogradec yesterday and continued to advance into Albanian territory. The report states that this advance threatens the strongholds of the retreating Italian forces, as the Italian army prepares to build new defensive lines at each point to resist the Greek forces. Greek cavalry entered Moscopole, ten miles west of Korçë, yesterday morning and continued to advance towards the Trevri River stronghold. The message further stated that the town of Gorisobo Li, on the Galamas River in the southern sector of the front, was occupied by Greek forces yesterday. According to an Athens dispatch from the London "Exchange Telegraph," the airfield at Argyrokastro was threatened by Greek forces yesterday. Greek and British aircraft bombed Italian air force bases in Tirana and Vlorë. Italian troops are currently attempting to reform their lines at a certain stronghold deep in Albanian territory. The Italian rearguard is making every effort to resist in the areas of Klisala, Fursari, and Tsira, in order to allow its main force to build new positions. (United Press Telegram, 25th)

Athens: The Greek High Command announced this morning that after the fall of Korçë, Greek forces advanced rapidly northwards, inflicting another fierce blow on the Italian army last night, occupying the strategically important city of Pogradec and almost completely annihilating an Italian division. In addition, they routed other Italian units totaling two thousand two hundred. The loss of the Italian position at Pogradec has been fully confirmed by neutral sources. All Italian electric wires in the eastern wing are in immediate danger of being destroyed as a result. On the southern front, Greek forces have occupied the high ground around Argyrokastro. Unconfirmed reports today say that Greek forces have entered the city. At the same time, New Zealand troops arrived in Greece, and the people of Athens cheered enthusiastically to welcome them today. Greek forces passing through Pogradec are pressing the Italian army along the Korçë-to-Elbasan highway without mercy. Hundreds of Italian soldiers struggling on the muddy roads were killed by Greek longsword cavalry. It is said that when Greek forces entered Pogradec, they captured one hundred transport vehicles and twelve field guns. Military observers believe that the occupation of Pogradec has eliminated the possibility of the Italian army flanking the Greek northern wing, unless the Italian army passes through a southern country. It was also learned today that two Italian divisions, totaling 30,000 men, have surrendered near Argyrokastro. It is reported that Albanian villagers are resisting the retreating Italian army because they are trying to destroy food supplies and storage items, thus hindering the Greek advance.

Albanian Transportation Hub Attacked by British Air Force

Cairo: British Air Force bombers attacked Elbasan, a transportation hub 20 miles southeast of Tirana, the Albanian capital, on Saturday and Sunday in adverse weather conditions. Bombs fell in the target area, but the results could not be estimated. Aelatun, Kalatz, Monastir, and Gambot in the eastern desert area were all attacked by aircraft. The buildings at Aelatun Airfield were bombed and set on fire. Three fires broke out in Kalatz. The airfields at Monastir and Gambot were heavily bombed. British aircraft attacked the Italian East African Agordat railway line, the Gola storage depot, and the Gasala battery. Malta was attacked twice by enemy aircraft, with minor casualties. One enemy fighter was shot down, and two other enemy aircraft were also damaged and crashed. British aircraft also repeatedly flew reconnaissance missions over enemy areas along various lines and have all returned safely. (Reuters Telegram, 25th)

British Army Arrives in Greece to Assist Greek Forces in Combat

London: A Reuters correspondent in Athens reports that several famous British warships, fully loaded with British and New Zealand troops, quietly sailed into a certain Greek port a few days ago in the bright sunlight. Anti-aircraft gunners on each ship were prepared on the deck to prevent attacks by Italian aircraft. Military trucks were transported ashore from the ships after the warships docked. The troops disembarked one after another amidst applause and cheers, vying to be the first to set foot on land, with remarkable speed and order. In less than five minutes, the first batch of trucks drove towards the city amidst the cheers of the crowds lining the streets. The troops were eager to know the achievements of the Greek army. Hearing the victorious news from the front, everyone was very excited. The soldiers and war materials carried by each British warship were successively unloaded. The soldiers they carried were necessary for the defense and maintenance of British airbases. Among them were the British Army engineering corps and air force ground personnel, as well as hundreds of New Zealand engineers. They were full of energy and high spirits upon arrival. They never saw an enemy plane or an enemy ship during their voyage. The Greek people gathered at the harbor, and seeing the endless stream of military trucks on the road, they took off their hats and shouted excitedly. (Reuters Telegram, 25th)

Italian Military Communiqué Declares They Are Launching a Vigorous Counteroffensive

Rome: This afternoon's Italian military communiqué stated that the Italian army is now launching a vigorous counteroffensive against Greek positions. Italian aircraft are assisting in the battle, bombing enemy positions, especially along the coast of Epirus. Enemy aircraft attacked Durazzo, injuring several civilians and causing minimal damage. One enemy aircraft was shot down by us. Our aircraft attacked a group of British aircraft on land at Micaba, three of which were hit and caught fire on the spot.

A long line of trucks is carrying Italian reinforcements to Pogradec on the road from Elbasan to Pogradec. Greek long-range artillery bombarded Pogradec at 6:00 PM last night, resulting in a fierce artillery battle. According to newspaper reports, news from the Albanian and Yugoslavian border near Lake Ohrid indicates that it rained and snowed heavily yesterday, and there was heavy fog, which greatly affected the fighting. Greek aircraft bombed the Elbasan-to-Pogradec highway yesterday morning. Twenty bombs landed in Yugoslavian territorial waters of Lake Ohrid, approaching the town of Ohrid, but there was no damage.

### Northern Ireland Prime Minister Craigavon Dies; Former British Postmaster General Tryon Also Dies Suddenly

London: Lord Craigavon, the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, passed away yesterday at the age of sixty-nine.

### British Aircraft Conducted Batch Attacks on French Coastal Ports; German Aircraft Bombarded British Military Industrial Areas

London: After dusk last night, British Air Force bombers conducted large-scale batch attacks on German-occupied ports and long-range artillery positions along the French coast. Soon, white light flashed along a 20-mile stretch of the French coast, illuminating the sky in all directions, as if all areas were simultaneously attacked by British aircraft using large bombs. Yesterday, several German aircraft squadrons attempted to attack London but were scattered by British fighters over the English Channel. One of the bombers was shot down by British aircraft. According to the Air Ministry, a few bombs fell in several areas of Kent, with minimal casualties and material damage. An air battle also occurred near Cheltenham yesterday, and a Junkers Ju 88 German aircraft was also shot down. In addition, on Saturday night, the center of a fierce attack by German bombers was a certain city on the southeast coast of England. German aircraft flew along the coast in batches and dropped incendiary bombs. The city was subjected to the most violent attack since the start of the war. High-explosive bombs damaged many churches, cinemas, sanatoriums, banks, hotels, shops, and residential buildings. Several places caught fire. Enemy aircraft attempted to drop bombs to spread the fire, but they were repelled by accurate anti-aircraft fire. (Reuters Telegram, 25th)

Berlin: According to German military sources, the German Air Force's attacks on British military industrial centers began with Coventry, followed by Birmingham, which has now been bombed for three consecutive nights. A total of hundreds of bombers participated in the attacks, dropping 300 tons of bombs. Most German aircraft carried out low-altitude bombing, so the extent of the damage was clearly visible. German aircraft came in batches from all directions, continuously and throughout the night. The British air defenses were overwhelmed by the concentrated bombing by large German formations, and they were largely at a loss. The Grantham armaments factory near Nottingham was also heavily damaged and suffered a major fire. Military targets in London's Midlands and southern England were also attacked. The German Air Force is becoming increasingly powerful, while the British Air Force is the opposite. Most of its attacks on Germany occur at night. Today, the military communiqué announced that a German submarine sank six British armed merchant ships, totaling 29,100 tons. (Haitong Telegram, 25th)

Berlin: Reliable sources here said this morning that German aircraft dropped hundreds of tons of bombs and thousands of incendiary bombs on Bristol last night. Hundreds of German bombers circled over the city for several hours. A gasoline depot was hit and caught fire, and other industrial facilities were also hit and caught fire. (Haitong Telegram, 25th)

London: Last night, German aircraft conducted a night raid on London, but they were repelled after a brief period of bombing. They then turned west and concentrated their attacks on an unnamed town in western England. This unnamed western town was heavily bombed by German aircraft for several hours. It is believed that the casualties must be very high, and it is believed that various buildings, including hospitals and churches, have suffered heavy damage. Nazi aircraft first dropped a large number of flares to identify the targets, and then dropped countless high-explosive bombs and incendiary bombs on the city. In addition to the western part of England being heavily attacked by German aircraft, German air activity last night was greatly reduced due to the rain and weather covering the entire English Channel. Several German aircraft were shot down by artillery in the English Channel area. One German aircraft was directly hit by artillery fire over Cornwall and exploded on the spot. The general public believes that this unnamed western city is Southampton. (International Telegram, 25th)

### German Military Communiqué

Important military installations on the southern and western coasts of England were hit by bombs. Last night, British aircraft dropped bombs in northern Germany, with no major losses. The British Ministry of Information claimed that British aircraft bombed the Berlin railway station the night before last, which is not true. No enemy aircraft were seen over Berlin the night before last. As a result of yesterday's air battles, one British aircraft was shot down, and two German aircraft were missing.

### Operational Achievements of Polish Air Squadrons; Over 200 German Aircraft Destroyed

London: Polish Prime Minister and Commander-in-Chief Sikorski announced that, to date, Polish air squadrons have destroyed over 200 German aircraft in the British theater of war. The Polish Air Force, with the help of Britain, has been greatly strengthened and expanded compared to before the war. Not all Polish Air Force personnel are currently participating in combat. Several reserve teams have been formed to meet future Polish needs. The British are fully aware of this situation, so they do not make excessive demands on our resources. However, the Polish Air Force will soon be able to participate in long-range flights to Polish territory, bombing German industries and German aviation training schools relocated to Polish territory. Subsequently, we will occupy more nearby bases in order to bomb the aggressors. Sikorski also said that the Polish Navy has greatly increased, and all previous losses have been replenished. The Polish Army in the UK are stationed in important defensive areas of Britain and are well received by the local people. (Reuters Telegram, 25th)

### British Daily War Expenditure Reaches £9.1 Million; Speech by Chancellor of the Exchequer Wood

London: Chancellor of the Exchequer Wood gave a speech in Glasgow today, saying that the enormous cost of the current war is unprecedented in the world. All weapons are becoming increasingly complex and expensive. To conquer the air, it is necessary to continue to use new and expensive weapons. The cost of aircraft today is seven times higher than during the last World War. Inferior aircraft, such as those found by Italy, are a waste of large sums of money. Britain supplies its troops with the best weapons. In the first 77 days of the second year of the war, Britain's daily war expenditure was £9.1 million. Wood continued, taxes have already reached a very large proportion, and no matter what progressive measures may need to be taken in the future, they will still be insufficient to pay for the entire war expenditure. It is very clear that there is currently a shortfall between income and expenditure, which must be made up by means other than taxes. In other words, this shortfall must be made up by the British people's savings and by lending the money they can save. In the first year of the war, the savings campaign raised a total of £475,000,000 from small savings. In addition, Britain has issued £300,000,000 of 3% War Bonds, £344,000,000 of 2.5% National War Bonds, and £23,000,000 of interest-free bonds. Therefore, in the past twelve months, a total of £1,140,000,000 has been raised. However, although this result is good, there will be even greater needs in the future. If all the people of the country do their duty, then Britain's ability to cope will not be difficult at all. (Reuters Telegram, 25th)

### France Protests to Britain Over Bombing of Marseille; Demands Apology and Compensation

In addition, many anti-Italian propaganda items were found. After studying the unexploded bombs, the authorities learned that they were made by British aircraft. The government immediately protested to the British government, demanding an apology and compensation for the losses. (Havas Telegram, 24th)

### British Newspapers Discuss the European War Situation

London: Editorials and articles by military experts continue to speculate on whether Hitler will assist Mussolini in Southeastern Europe and whether he will resist when Yugoslavia is invaded. The Times newspaper wrote in its editorial that Hitler, seeing that Mussolini has been well taught and making it clear that he is isolated without German assistance, may not necessarily regret it, but he may not allow his Axis partner to be humiliated too much. If Germany wants to intervene, it can only invade Yugoslavia or induce Bulgaria to allow it to pass through and attack Greece and Yugoslavia itself. A military offensive against Yugoslavia is not easy to undertake, but a joint offensive by Germany from Hungary and Bulgaria from the east would repeat the method by which Serbia was broken in the previous Great War. However, the current season is not very suitable. If the Italian needs are not very urgent, Hitler is willing to wait until next spring. Major General Gwyne, a military expert for the Daily Telegraph, stated that the Greek victory has a significant impact on Yugoslavia's military position. A month ago, the Southern country might not have dared to slightly violate the wishes of the Southern dictator. The current situation has changed greatly. The Italian army can no longer pose a threat, as the Greek army has cut off the road from Monastir to Western Macedonia, greatly reducing the opportunity for Yugoslavia to have its communication with Thessaloniki cut off or its rear attacked. Germany will certainly be prompted by the idea of ​​helping its allies and will use force against the South. From a military point of view, I do not think so. If the South resists, then Germany will lose the benefits it has gained from the South maintaining neutrality. Moreover, fighting in the mountainous terrain with Europe's best fighting race in the dead of winter will have even greater food difficulties. Even with mechanized units, the future does not seem optimistic. (Reuters Telegram, 25th)

### Papal Broadcast Speech Urges World Peace, Fasting for a Week in Prayer for Peace

Rome - Rome Radio reported that the Pope will fast for a week to ask God for peace. (Reuters, 25th)

Rome - Pope Pius XII, yesterday, delivered a one hour and twenty-one-minute speech via radio in front of the altar of St. Peter's Basilica. His calls for peace were the strongest since the outbreak of the European war. However, the Pope does not seem to hold out hope for peace in the near future. Pius called on Christians worldwide to pray to God, hoping that God would aid in the face of the calamities of war, especially the pain of aerial bombings. High-ranking officials in the Vatican believe that this decree may be the Pope's last call for peace, as he has asked God to intervene, implicitly acknowledging that the disaster of war is beyond human redemption. The Pope is scheduled to hold a week of prayer for peace, starting at 6:00 AM this Sunday, with rituals including fasting, prayer, and meditation, ending at 9:00 AM the following Sunday. The Pope spoke with a voice choked with emotion, expressing sorrow for the war and all the destruction. Whenever the Pope mentioned the war, his voice trembled and tears welled up in his eyes. He called out, hoping that after the war ends, a just and lasting peace can be achieved. He said, "The world does not seem to be able to accommodate the desires of mankind. War not only fails to stop destruction but is sufficient to increase it. We are now crying out in pain. We urge every believer to pray together to God, so that He may grant us peace. May the fair truth of Christianity balance the victors and the vanquished." Numerous high-ranking clergy from churches across Italy, Roman nobles, and diplomatic corps attended the penitential mass held by the Pope to listen to the speech. (Central News Agency, 25th)

The Tragic History of the European War (III)

### Three Protagonists in the French Tragedy (III) - Reynaud, Exhausted in Responding

If there is a shortage of manpower, it can certainly be compensated by mass production of tanks and airplanes, and by forming large-scale technical corps or professional corps. However, in France, some people believe that the importance of tanks has been exaggerated too much, and thus they are opposed. Moreover, forming independent units in the army is another astonishing innovation. They only know how to stick to the rules and cling to the past. The strategy advocated by French military personnel is not to indulge in fantasy!

On the political front, there is also a lack of decisiveness, resulting in a double dilemma. The Prime Minister only knows how to use gentle words and pleasant expressions to appease the voters and relies on the support of the military, thinking that there is nothing to worry about and can rest easy. At that time, a politician was considered a "good Minister of the Army" as long as he obeyed the officers; otherwise, he would not be able to stay in his position.

If France had not followed its diplomatic policies only on paper and had instead diligently assumed the role of police officer for the League of Nations, things might have been fine. When an accident occurs anywhere in Europe, is it better for the police to rush to maintain order or to stay in the guardhouse in front of their own door because they are not prepared to leave? In 1935, French Minister of the Army General Maurin was a soldier with a straightforward personality, unlike politicians who are good at empty rhetoric. On June 3 of that year, he honestly told the Chamber of Deputies: "We have spent countless amounts of money building defenses. Does anyone still believe that we will take the offensive? Wouldn't it be foolish for us to run outside these defenses and take unnecessary risks?" In mid-March of the following year, German troops reoccupied the Rhineland. In October, the King of Belgium also rescinded Belgium's obligations to Britain and France under the Locarno Treaty, leaving France isolated.

When German troops reoccupied the Rhineland, the French government consulted with the military. It was said that nothing could be done without large-scale mobilization. At that time, there were only six weeks left until the general election for the Chamber of Deputies, so the French government took no action other than protesting. If France had had the professional army that had been repeatedly requested but to no avail, it could have dealt with the situation with force without the need for national mobilization.

In 1934, France discovered a pamphlet titled "Professional Army," but the public did not pay attention to it. The book stated: "If Germany is determined to use the simplest method to strike at our heart, couldn't it attack from our weakest point, the river Vasle? France's most dangerous defense depends on Belgium. This country of Belgium is our vanguard, but can we guarantee that it will not suddenly turn against us when fighting with all its might alone?" The author accurately predicted the value of the Maginot Line when it was tested. He said, "We cannot overestimate the resistance of permanent fortifications. The organization of these fortifications only has a certain depth. The entire northern territory is completely empty. And how can we predict the effectiveness of modern offensive weapons such as airplanes and tanks against fortifications?" On another page, the author described the war of 1940 in detail six years in advance. "On a thirty-mile-long front, two thousand tanks surge forward like a raging tide. ... At this time, there is no such thing as a continuously connected front, no time for leisurely deployment, and no possibility of achieving local victories." The author also predicted that the air force would use lightning speed to give the enemy the most violent blow. He advocated taking the initiative, believing that this was the most effective way to deal with the German army. Germany's military operations have always been prepared with the utmost precision, and only by being unexpected can they be thrown into disarray. The victories of Vermeille, Aina, and the Marne River in the last European war were all due to this strategy. The author of this pamphlet was named Charles de Gaulle, an unknown person who was able to publish the bold theories that the younger generation had never had before. In fact, this officer under General Pétain had been planning this since 1920. Reynaud and the German military took great interest in his works.

In 1935, the French government submitted to Congress a plan to form a large number of mechanized divisions. Although Reynaud tried his best to defend it, it was ultimately rejected. The opposition either believed that it was difficult to implement or used economic reasons to dismiss it. In fact, the true intention of their opposition was to prefer the old national conscription system to the formation of an independent professional army, fearing that it would become a private army in politics? A general wrote in the following year: "France, which is peaceful and defensive, has to oppose mechanization."

In 1936, Reynaud said: "Our northeast defense is very strong, but we must not mistakenly believe that it is indestructible." He also said: "The German army, led by powerful tank forces, may cross the Netherlands and Belgium, where the Albert Canal is located. We hope to have fully consolidated defenses; otherwise, the German army will invade our 350-kilometer northern border." At the time, the public paid no attention to this warning.

Although France also had the organization of armored divisions, the delay was very long, and the quantity was also insufficient. In other words, it was too wasteful. Reynaud once declared in Congress: "We must deal with military problems with a great spirit. In war, only great power can win." However, France failed to decide to cultivate sufficient strength to deal with the situation once something happened in Europe, and at the same time, it was unwilling to abandon its mutual assistance policy.

"There is still plenty of time" and "Everything will go smoothly" are France's two fatal flaws. Reynaud privately expressed deep concern to the general public before the war and often said: "How rash we are in politics! A pretense of calmness and a mistaken sense of common sense make the people of Paris and other places not take Hitler very seriously. Therefore, they can be leisurely and do not need to catch up quickly." Even during the war, they acted as if there was plenty of time in the future. For example, the unhurried procurement of military supplies in the United States was obvious. Were the machines they ordered not prepared to be installed in factories that had not yet been completed, and would they not manufacture airplanes until 1942? There was also a strange phenomenon: the French army had repeatedly been ordered to be prudent. Unexpectedly, at the critical moment on September 1, 1939, it carelessly indicated that France could be victorious, which not only surprised the then Minister of Foreign Affairs Bonnet but also shocked the then Prime Minister Daladier. Optimism increased with danger. However, on the side of the people, from the time the mobilization order was issued, they completely changed their accumulated habits and were able to replace the previous laziness and neglect with the inherent virtues of the French nation. The US Ambassador to France, William Bullitt, said that the French soldiers of 1940, like those of 1914, were willing to sacrifice everything at any cost. As for the subsequent collapse of the entire army, it was because they had not been trained in new tactics and had not learned how to resist new techniques. They were attacked unexpectedly, resulting in panic and loss of control.

There was no shortage of thoughtful people in the French military and Congress. They repeatedly shouted the slogan "Reform or perish" and pointed out various dangers facing France over the years, such as the decline in productivity, the decline in national prestige, the shrinking of large-scale facilities, the misunderstanding of individualism, and other evils that were eroding democracy, until it existed in name only. How earnest were the words, but how indifferent were the listeners. Finally, they were taught with reality. However, this lesson was too painful. (The End)

Correction: In the second line of the first paragraph of yesterday's article, i.e., "government authorities or the commanders of the three armed forces. They," should be placed before the illustration, i.e., after the line "France's fate is no longer dependent on." This correction is hereby made.

### Madame Chiang's Speech in America Gains Widespread Sympathy, Recounting China's Fight for Freedom and Justice, Appealing to America for Encouragement and Assistance, America Raises $1 Million in Donations

The United American Relief for China, initiated in America this month, the 14th, a campaign to raise $1 million. Madame Chiang, Chairperson of the Committee, traveled to Hong Kong to broadcast to America, appealing for aid to China's sick and wounded. The United American Relief for China is a recently organized initiative by Mrs. Pearl Buck, with Mrs. Roosevelt, President of the U.S. as the chair, to continue the excellent work of the "Book of Hope" donation drive. Madame Chiang's speech was broadcast by various stations of the American Broadcasting Company for four minutes. The company temporarily suspended its music programs to solemnly announce Madame Chiang's broadcast speech at 7:45 PM. Madame Chiang's speech was touching and appealed to American friends for aid to China's sick, wounded, and displaced people. Her conclusion stated: "The Chinese people are determined to continue fighting for the principles of humanity, freedom, justice, and equality. There is only one way to realize these principles, that is, we are willing to manage, work tirelessly, endure suffering without complaint, and fight bravely to achieve them." According to a telegram received from Pearl Buck, the response to Madame Chiang's broadcast was overwhelmingly enthusiastic throughout the United States. The next morning, the United American Relief for China received a package of donation checks of various amounts and dozens of congratulatory telegrams. The full text of Madame Chiang's broadcast speech is as follows:

Meaningful Sympathetic Aid

American friends, I must first thank you today for your generous efforts, which have enabled Mrs. Pearl Buck and others to establish what is called the "Committee for Contributions to China," and I also express my gratitude for the good intentions contained in the "Book of Hope" movement. You are giving us assistance and encouragement, and what is more, you have faith in our goals and understand the issues involved in our struggle and how important they are to the whole world. China needs sympathetic aid, and this aid is not a passive good deed but an action of constructive hope that is welcomed by China.

Achievements in Relief for Child Refugees

Now, in response to the invitation to talk about China's needs for relief funds, I would like to describe how our people are trying to cope with this need, not just to talk about the need itself. First, let me briefly mention the issue of child refugees, which Chinese women are extremely concerned about. Chinese wartime orphanages have achieved success, which can be called unparalleled in children's education. At a time when living expenses are soaring, these innocent little citizens, in addition to being cared for by the government, need more external assistance than in the past. Having experienced pain, they know how to unite as one, just like the whole of China.

Suffering from Lack of Medicine

Next, regarding general refugees, the National Relief Commission, chaired by Finance Minister Kong, aims to enable displaced people to earn a living on their own. Therefore, it has cultivated land to resettle 630,000 refugees and established refugee factories and subsidized various industries to accommodate refugees. I often visit military hospitals and hospitals for civilians injured in air raids, and I deeply know that the issue of medical relief is extremely important. The temporary closure of the Burma Road has deprived us of access to medicines, so that even when performing surgery, there is no anesthetic available. Men, women, old and young, suffer this pain, which cannot be alleviated. This situation is something that even the people of Europe who have encountered war have not seen. I hope that the people of Europe will never see this tragic scene. Now that the Burma Road has reopened, it is gratifying. It is hoped that with the help of friends, we will be able to obtain the necessary medicines.

Women Donate Over 50 Million

Although my compatriots at home and abroad have suffered reduced incomes due to the war for three years and four months, they are still donating generously. For example, the National Women's Relief Association of China has donated more than 50 million yuan in property since the outbreak of the war, which is just one example. However, the need for relief is enormous, and this amount is like a drop in the bucket. We are resisting Japanese aggression and are now entering our fourth winter, which is extremely difficult. But the Chinese people are determined to continue fighting for the basic principles of humanity, freedom, justice, and equality that Americans cherish. There is only one way to realize these principles, that is, we are willing to manage, work tirelessly, endure suffering without complaint, and fight bravely to achieve them. We sincerely thank our American friends for their help in rescuing the sick and wounded. Goodbye.

### Forensic Doctor Jiang Zhengxuan Maintains Integrity

Jiang Xuan, a forensic doctor at the Second Special District Local Court Procuratorate, has served since the beginning of the office. When the court was forcefully taken over this time, Jiang planned to resign. However, due to being surrounded by the successor "President" Sun Shaokang, he was unable to leave. Now, it is learned that Mr. Jiang has resolutely resigned and retired to seek other avenues in order to maintain his integrity.

### Negotiations on Unresolved Conditions Between Labor and Management of the French Tram Company Today

More than a thousand workers in the mechanical department of the French Tram Company previously requested that the management provide double pay and bonuses according to the workers in the car department who did not participate in the previous general strike. After failing to receive a satisfactory response from the management, they launched a slowdown strike at around 1:00 PM on the 24th. That night, the labor side held a meeting to discuss. In order to take the overall situation into account, they resumed work the next day and continued to demand from the management. The management responded to this yesterday and held direct negotiations. The labor side then appointed six representatives to participate in the labor-management negotiations at 5:30 PM yesterday. The reporter from this news agency learned that yesterday's labor-management meeting did not take place at that time because the company's general manager, Fafoley (transliteration), had other important matters at that time and could not attend the meeting. The management temporarily notified the labor side to reschedule. It is learned that the company has scheduled today (the 26th) at 5:30 PM to formally hold direct negotiations with the labor side.

### British Team of the Merchant Corps Supplemented by Czechs

Czech expatriates in this city unanimously express pro-British sentiment. According to authoritative sources among foreign expatriates in this city, with the European war in full swing, Czech nationals who had been living in Shanghai and were from the first country to fall to Germany, all now unanimously express pro-British sentiment. It is also learned that thirty Czech youths have recently joined the services of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps. They joined the British "A" Company, as there has never been a Czech unit in the Shanghai Volunteer Corps. This is the first time. Currently, the number of members in the British "A" Company is quite lacking. With the addition of these Czech youths, the strength is sufficient. At the same time, it also demonstrates the close cooperation between the expatriates of Britain and the Czech Republic.

### China's New Loan from the US to be Fully Repaid Next Year; New Loan Secured by Tung Oil Sales, Estimated to be US$20 Million This Year

The English-language Financial and Commercial News reports that the US$25 million credit loan from the United States to China is secured by Chinese tung oil. Recently, the Sichuan Trading Company has been actively handling the transportation of tung oil to ensure the repayment of the US debt. It is estimated that the value of tung oil exports in 1940 will be no less than US$20 million. The US credit loan will be fully repaid in the next fiscal year.

The selling price of tung oil in the United States is currently US$550 per ton, and the market price is expected to rise further. According to news from Chongqing, Sichuan will expand the tung oil industry and has drafted a five-year tung oil planting plan. During this period, 18 million tung trees will be planted, bringing the total number of tung trees in the province to 56 million, which can produce 1 million dan of tung oil annually. According to the report of the Sichuan Trading Company, currently 100 tons of tung oil are shipped to Rangoon every day. From June to October of this year, approximately 12,000 tons of tung oil were shipped. It is estimated that 6,000 tons of tung oil can be shipped out in the two months of November and December. The disturbances caused by the bombing of the Burma Road were temporary.

It never took more than a few hours to transport tung oil from China to Lashio, which proves that Japan's plan to obstruct China's tung oil exports is insignificant. Very little tung oil shipped to Britain and the United States via the seven seas fell into the hands of the Japanese. According to official statistics, Japan only obtained 746 tons of tung oil in 1937 and only 28 tons last year. Although tung oil exported through Hankou is not included in the statistics, the trade there is not large. According to the news from the US Consulate General in Hankou, there is also not much tung oil exported there. Most of the tung oil in the occupied areas is smuggled from the free zone.

### Chinese Merchants with Goods Detained in Japan Must Submit Supporting Documents and Powers of Attorney to Apply for Return; Saigon Chinese Chamber of Commerce Telegraphed Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, Instructing Shippers to Comply Promptly

Regarding the detained passengers and goods of the Shanghai, Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou joint transport in Vietnam, after the Vietnamese Governor canceled the order allowing return, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has made representations to France, and the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce has made efforts to argue the case. The chamber has recently received a telegram from the Saigon Chinese Chamber of Commerce stating that for goods detained by Chinese merchants in Saigon, the shippers must submit supporting documents and powers of attorney in order to negotiate with the Vietnamese Governor. It is learned that the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce has instructed the shippers to comply promptly. It is said that once the goods detained in Vietnam are approved, they will be returned to Hong Kong and Shanghai, then re-loaded onto ships and transported to Rangoon, and then transferred to various inland areas in the Southwest.

### US Relief Rice and Wheat Arriving in Shanghai; Discussion Today on Distribution; Shanghai Branch of the American Red Cross to Handle Everything; Second Batch of Medicines Transported to the Interior

The second batch of 20,000 bags of rice and wheat for the American Red Cross's relief efforts for Chinese refugees, loaded on the American mail ship SS Coolidge, arrived in Shanghai. The ship docked at the Hongkou Gonghexiang Wharf, and the rice and wheat were unloaded yesterday. The reporter from the Pingming News Agency visited the Sino-Foreign Famine Relief Committee yesterday to learn about the situation.

Relief Organizations to Distribute Jointly

According to Mr. Zhou of the committee, this rice and wheat is specifically for the relief of refugees in Shanghai and the occupied areas. The distribution method will be discussed and decided jointly by the Shanghai Branch of the American Red Cross, the Sino-Foreign Famine Relief Committee, and various relief organizations at a meeting today. As for the second batch of relief supplies from the American Red Cross, they are all medicines and have already departed for China. They are en route to Rangoon and will be transported to the Chinese interior via the Burma Road.

Baker Leaves Chongqing, Passes Through Hong Kong, Returns to Shanghai

These rice, wheat, and medicines were all raised by the committee's general secretary, Dr. Baker, during his return to the United States last November. The first batch arrived in China with Baker when he returned to China in September of this year and was transported to the interior. Yesterday, the Sino-Foreign Famine Relief Committee received a letter from Baker from Rangoon stating that his mission to Chongqing had been completed. He arrived in Rangoon at the beginning of the month and stayed for two weeks. He is scheduled to return to Hong Kong on the first of next month, stay for a few days, and then come to Shanghai.

American Red Cross Branch Recently Established

The Shanghai Branch of the American Red Cross, formerly known as the Shanghai International Red Cross, was recently renamed the American Red Cross, with Dr. Baker as the general secretary and Mr. Qiu De, the former general secretary of the Navy YMCA, as the deputy general secretary. The location has been decided to be in the American Union Building on Fuzhou Road. In the future, all relief supplies shipped to China from the United States will be handled by the branch. The branch has also established offices in Hong Kong and Rangoon. It was once reported that Father Rao, the general secretary of the Sino-Foreign Famine Relief Committee, would fly to America from Hong Kong. It is now learned that Rao went to Vietnam and then to the Philippines in September, but he did not make the trip to America and has now returned to Hong Kong. There is no news of him coming to Shanghai yet.

### Representatives of Jews from Various Regions to Convene in Dalian

Representatives of Jewish expatriates from all over China will gather in Dalian on December 9 to hold the Far East Jewish Representatives Conference. These representatives will discuss refugee issues, elect new committee members, and review various reports in Dalian. The mission of these representatives is to seek rights for more than 10,000 Jewish expatriates in the Far East. The meeting will last for four days and is expected to complete various procedures on December 12. This organization is a non-political entity that pays great attention to religious issues and the happiness of Jewish expatriates in the Far East.

### War Risk Insurance Flourishes; Central Trust Bureau Underwrites; Exceeding 80 Million Yuan

Since the Central Trust Bureau was ordered to implement war risk insurance in October of the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937), it has achieved considerable results. The war disaster insurance policies issued have reached 86.5 million yuan, with transport insurance accounting for 60 million yuan and the rest being bombing insurance, etc. Among the cities where war risk insurance is handled, Chongqing is the most important, with its insurance amount accounting for one-third of the country. The premiums collected are lower than any war risk insurance from foreign countries.

### The Price Surge of Rice, Coal, and Flour: Middle Class Struggles to Survive; Authorities Urged to Stabilize Prices

The price of rice is excessively high, coal briquettes are soaring, and even subsidized flour is increasing in price. Ordinary citizens will be forced to cut their wages and run out of food. If this continues, the livelihoods of the common people will be unsustainable. The only solution lies in opening up domestic and foreign supply channels, increasing reserves, and at the same time, the authorities of the two concessions must take responsibility for strictly cracking down on illegal transactions in the market, punishing unscrupulous merchants. It is essential that the market prices of necessities can turn toward stability, and save the common people from their dire straits. This concerns the entire social order and is no small matter.

Rumors Rampant in the Rice Market

Yesterday morning, rumors resurfaced in the rice market. The price of foreign rice continued to be pushed higher for several days. However, yesterday, the French postal ship "Songtai" arrived in port with 20,000 bags of rice. At the same time, more than 2,500 bags of domestic rice were also transported. It was also learned that the Pudong Association held its 101st board of directors meeting the day before yesterday afternoon to discuss concerns about the scarcity of domestic rice sources and the future of people's food supply. They proposed organizing a group purchase of foreign rice by fellow villagers to make adjustments. The proposal has been approved, and Xing Zhigang and Wang Qinbo, two directors, have been elected to be responsible for organizing a special committee, and reliable banks and rice warehouses for handling receipts have been contacted and agreed upon. A simple charter has been drafted, and fellow villagers who wish to order foreign rice are invited to go to the association's office on Avenue Edward VII to register as soon as possible. The quantity of foreign rice shipped to Shanghai from abroad in October has been statistically completed, with a total of 277,011 quintals arriving, valued at 1,708,52 gold units, equivalent to 4,624,966 yuan in national currency. Domestic rice shipments to Shanghai last month are estimated to have reached more than 250,000 dan.

Prospects for the Coal Market

Coal reserves are very substantial. According to estimates from the coal industry, there are more than 300,000 tons, which is enough to meet the city's needs for more than three months. In recent days, the spot market for coal has seen a sharp increase in supply, and market conditions are gradually stabilizing. The Jianghai Customs Tax Department released yesterday that the quantity of coal shipped to Shanghai from abroad in October of the 29th year has been statistically completed, totaling 126,449 tons, valued at 845,470 gold units, equivalent to 2,288,687 yuan in national currency. However, it is understood that the sudden outbreak of the Vietnam incident last month prevented British merchant ships from traveling between Shanghai and Vietnam, resulting in the inability to transport the smoke-white coal produced in Annam to Shanghai. Recently, the number of flights between Shanghai and Vietnam has gradually increased, and French shipping companies have increased the number of ships traveling between Shanghai and Vietnam, so the shipment of smoke-white coal produced in Annam to Shanghai has returned to its original state.

Manipulating Flour

The flour needed by the common people has been purchased and adjusted in large quantities from the United States and Australia by the two major flour mills, Fuxin and Fufeng, since the war, so the market price is still relatively stable, and the market situation is also quite stable. However, due to the changing international situation, the source is not without difficulties. Speculators take advantage of the opportunity to manipulate the flour market. Spot goods are becoming scarce, people are anxious, and the market price has been continuously pushed higher. Now each bag has reached 15 to 16 yuan. Under the pretext that the price of flour has risen slightly, the price of subsidized flour has also been increased by one yuan per bag since yesterday. However, ordinary citizens have already suffered a lot. According to news revealed by relevant parties yesterday, the total amount of wheat shipped to Shanghai from abroad last month was 164,612 quintals, valued at 821,546 gold units, equivalent to 2,223,925 yuan in national currency, all shipped from Australia. Wheat flour totaled 2,468 quintals, valued at 16,848 gold units, equivalent to 45,608 yuan in national currency.

### Ten British Nationals Voluntarily Enlist; All Ten Enjoy Reputation in Shanghai; Eight American Nationals from Tianjin Join

Ten more British nationals in Shanghai will leave Shanghai tonight or tomorrow (the 27th) to voluntarily enlist. These ten people are all well-known in Shanghai's business, sports, and social circles. Six of them will join the British Air Force, and the remaining four will go to India to join the Army. So far, since the outbreak of the European War in October, a total of 132 British nationals in Shanghai have joined the military. Eight British nationals from Tianjin have been in Shanghai for several days and will set sail on the same ship with the ten British nationals in Shanghai to join the military. British military officers in this city said that these volunteers would not be sent to Malaysia for training, but refused to disclose on what ship they would travel or where those who joined the Air Force would be trained.

### French Concession Enacts Lease Regulations; Concerns About Sovereignty; Careful Study Needed to Determine if Chinese Sovereignty is Infringed

Residents within the French Concession are currently very concerned about the draft housing rent issue announced by Mr. Duke. Chinese and foreign nationals are preparing to submit their private opinions on the draft to various groups for research. Because the draft relates to the housing problem of the people within the French Concession, and once the amendments become regulations, they will be effective single laws with the same nature as laws, whether they conflict with Chinese civil and criminal law, and whether they infringe Chinese sovereignty, are also important issues and must be carefully studied. The French Consul General, Mr. Magre, is currently studying the report submitted by the French Concession Housing Rent Investigation Committee. It is reported that Mr. Magre may accept the recommendations in the report. Mr. He Qi (transliteration), legal advisor to the French Municipal Council and chairman of the Housing Rent Investigation Committee, both advocate abolishing petty rents, prohibiting high-price transfers, high-price subletting, and monopolizing rent practices.

### Wenzhou Appeals for Famine Relief

The Shanghai Association of Wenzhou Received telegrams from various counties in Wenzhou stated that since September of the old calendar this year, due to the lack of rice and soaring prices, the price of rice has risen from 1.1 yuan per 12 jin to 1 yuan per 2 jin, breaking all previous records. In Yongjia, Ruian and other places, misery is widespread, and starving people are everywhere. The severity has reached its peak. A huge bloody incident occurred in Yongjia City a month ago due to disaster victims抢 rice. It was quelled by the authorities, resulting in the death of six civilians and the injury of more than ten people. In order to relieve the disaster, the Yongjia County Government recently telegraphed the Shanghai Association of Fellow Villagers, requesting to raise funds to purchase rice and transport it to Wenzhou for relief, requiring a sum of one million yuan. After receiving the telegram, the Wenzhou Association of Fellow Villagers decided to raise funds first to relieve the immediate crisis. Xu Jiqing and others have initiated the organization of the Yongjia Rice Famine Relief Committee, planning to raise 300,000 yuan from fellow villagers in Shanghai first and remit it to Wenzhou for relief. It is expected that those who are enthusiastic about their hometown will be able to raise enough money in a short period of time.

### Westerners' Paper Chase Race Obstructed by Farmers; Fortunately, Situation Not Serious and Resolved; Participants Agree to Compensate Farmers' Losses

The "North-China Daily News" reported that the Shanghai Westerners' Paper Chase Racing Association held its first paper chase race of the season in the countryside of Hongqiao and Robison Road (the 4th). Participants wanted to ride their horses across farmers' land, but were strongly opposed by the farmers, resulting in a series of unpleasant incidents. The race was obstructed. At that time, the villagers were in a fierce mood, but fortunately, each incident was not serious in nature, and the matter was finally resolved satisfactorily.

A Native European Injured

The only person injured was a native European servant employed by the Association to scatter shredded paper along the way by horseback (the participants follow the path of this shredded paper to the finish line). He was closest to the angry villagers and was beaten with sticks. If not for intervention, he would have been seriously injured. When Mr. Little arrived at the finish line of the race and talked with the villagers for a while, a settlement was reached. It was learned that the servant's injuries were not serious.

Obstacles Along the Way Forced Detours

Before this incident, the participants encountered another group of farmers blocking the way. The farmers held sticks, stones, and bamboo poles, and took a threatening attitude. Two Chinese members who participated in the race tried to persuade the farmers to make way, but to no avail, so they led their horses back and detoured. It was also heard that there were farmers blocking the road with obstacles only a mile away from the finish line. Some participants followed the shredded paper to that place and could not move forward.

Forced Entry into Farmhouse to Reach Finish Line

A moment later, the leader of the participants also arrived in front of the obstacles. Seeing the flags planted at the finish line in the distance, he looked around for a passage but could not find one, so he rode his horse into a farmhouse and went out the back door to the finish line. The others followed, passing through the farmhouse. The farmers were furious and summoned many villagers to negotiate. It was heard that two of the farmers drew guns in anger. After a moment of negotiation, the participants agreed to compensate for the losses, and the matter subsided.

### Restrictions on Passengers Traveling to Hong Kong; Notice Received; New Regulations Implemented on the 18th of Next Month; American Liner Cancels Hong Kong Sailing

The British authorities in Hong Kong have issued new regulations to prevent undesirable elements from entering the country and have decided to implement them on the 18th of next month. The Taikoo and Jardine companies in this city and the travel agencies in this city have received official notices. Passengers on all shipping lines that arrive in Hong Kong after the 17th of next month must comply with the new regulations. Otherwise, the two companies will refuse to issue tickets.

American Liner Cancels Hong Kong Sailing

The "President Coolidge" of the American President Lines is currently sailing from San Francisco to Shanghai. The ship was originally scheduled to arrive in port via Japan on the 17th of next month and was scheduled to sail from this port to Hong Kong on the 18th. However, the American President Lines authorities suddenly announced yesterday that the ship's sailing to Hong Kong on the 18th of this month would be cancelled. The reason for this was not explained by the company authorities, but it is generally believed that because the liner must arrive in Hong Kong after the 18th, all passengers on board must go through new procedures. In order to avoid trouble for the time being, the sailing to Hong Kong has been cancelled.

Empress of Asia Rushes to Sail to Hong Kong

In addition, there is a huge liner, the "Empress of Asia", owned by the Changxing Company. According to the company's scheduled sailing schedule, it was originally scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Hong Kong on the 16th of next month. However, in addition to passengers from Shanghai, there are also passengers from Japan traveling to Hong Kong. The passengers will not be able to complete the new procedures in time, so the Changxing Shipping Company authorities have ordered the liner to shorten the scheduled departure date and must arrive in Shanghai before the 13th of next month, deciding to sail from Shanghai to Hong Kong on the 13th of next month, in order to avoid the restrictions of the new regulations.

### Major Theft at Clock and Watch Store; Zhongmei Company Loses More Than 1,700 Watches; Seventeen Store Employees Detained for Investigation

The Zhongmei Clock and Watch Company at 467 Nanjing Road has a business practice of moving all valuable clocks and watches into the safe every night after closing. On the night of the 23rd of this month, the company followed the previous practice. However, when opening the safe for business the next morning, it was discovered that all the valuable clocks and watches placed in the safe were missing. After checking, it was found that about 1,700 watches were lost, with a purchase value of 100,000 yuan. If calculated at the retail price, it would be more than 400,000 yuan. The company reported this to the Laozha Police Station, and Chinese detective Zhang Xingyan went to investigate. Since the safe was not damaged, it was clear that someone had obtained the key and opened it. However, there were as many as seventeen employees and apprentices living in the store, so it must be an inside job. The employees living in the store were suspected, so Ye Jinkui, Hu Shixing, Yan Dade, Wu Shan, Hu Liangrui, Yan Rengen, Ling Zhongxin, Jin Baozong, Sun Bingwen, Hou Shifu, Wang Zhizhao, Mu Wenhui, Jiang Yuankang, Gu Changxiang, Dong Xiaolan, Dong Fucang, Dong Ziqi and other seventeen people were taken back to the police station for investigation. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Special District. The police lawyer, Ru Baoqi, stated that the case was serious and the investigation would take time, so he requested permission to temporarily detain the suspects. If it was found that they were not involved, he would immediately request their release to avoid innocent people being implicated. After questioning by Judge Feng Shide, he ordered that all of them be temporarily detained and that the hearing be rescheduled.

Draft Lease Regulations for Real Estate Prepared by the French Concession Rent Research Association (Continued)

(Article 18) Subletting or transfer, whether or not the landlord's consent has been obtained, the tenant's profit shall not exceed 10% of the original rent.

### Real Estate Developer Illicitly Occupies Two Younger Sisters-in-Law; Wife Demands Living Expenses; Court Rejects Part of the Claim; Savings Account of 1,400 Yuan Awarded to Plaintiff

Fan Wenyuan, a 35-year-old native of Ningbo, is engaged in the real estate business. In the eleventh year of the Republic of China, he married Ying Xiu'e, a woman from his hometown, through a matchmaker. Ying was 19 years old at the time. The couple lived together at No. 30, Lane 640, Liaoyang Road, Pudong, and were very affectionate. They had four children: a son named Guorui, who is 18 years old this year; a second son named Guozhang, who is 16 years old; a third son named Guohan, who is 15 years old; and a young daughter named Zizhen, who is 12 years old. Who would have known that good times would not last?

Ying had two younger sisters, Xiao'e and Xiang'e, who often visited their older sister, so they became acquainted with their brother-in-law. Because the two younger sisters-in-law were young and beautiful and both unmarried, Fan seduced them in every possible way. In the winter of the 25th year of the Republic of China, he had physical relations with Xiao'e and Xiang'e one after another. Xiao'e and Xiang'e, because they were deeply in love with their brother-in-law, fled together. Fan also disappeared. After this incident, Ying and her mother's family suspected that Fan had improper behavior with Xiao'e and Xiang'e, so

they searched everywhere. On June 9 of the following year, they discovered that Fan was cohabiting with the two younger sisters-in-law at No. 73, Shanghai Li, Avenue Edward VII. Ying came forward and reported this to the Huishi Police Station in charge, ordering detectives to go to the address to catch them in the act of adultery. Fan and the two younger sisters-in-law were found sleeping in the same bed and were arrested together and brought to the First Criminal Court of the Special District, where they were prosecuted for adultery. Fan, Xiao'e, and Xiang'e all confessed to cohabitation without denying it. Later, Ying, at the urging of relatives and friends,

withdrew the charges. After Fan and the two younger sisters-in-law regained their freedom, he gave her a bank savings account of 2,400 yuan. Later, he sent a letter to the bank to stop payment. Ying recently stated that her children are growing up and need money everywhere, so she hired lawyer Huang Jiyuan to file a complaint in the Civil Court of the First Special District, requesting confirmation that the savings account of 2,400 yuan belonged to the plaintiff and requesting that the defendant Fan Wenyuan be ordered to pay the plaintiff and her children 300 yuan per month for living expenses starting from September of this year. Judge Xu was in charge of the case. The defendant Fan Wenyuan hired a lawyer to appear in court, stating that the plaintiff Ying Xiu'e took advantage of the defendant's weakness in committing adultery with the two younger sisters-in-law

and had already seized most of his assets. He claimed that the plaintiff had considerable wealth and requested that the plaintiff's lawsuit be dismissed. After Judge Xu summoned both parties for detailed questioning, he rendered a judgment the other day: regarding the part about living expenses, the plaintiff's lawsuit was dismissed; regarding the savings account of 2,400 yuan, it was confirmed to belong to Ying Xiu'e.

A Debauched Son Neglects His Duties; His Mother Leads a Crowd to Strangle Him; Afterward, Falsely Reported as Murder; Investigation Reveals the Truth

### A Debauched Son Neglects His Duties; His Mother Leads a Crowd to Strangle Him; Afterward, Falsely Reported as Murder; Investigation Reveals the Truth

On the 23rd of this month, at 4:30 AM, a case of a mother strangling her own son occurred at the intersection of Tengyue Road and Haizhou Road, Yangshupu. The circumstances are recorded below. Zhu Zhu, a woman from Jiangbei, is 67 years old this year. She lives in a bungalow in Wu's Residence, Haizhou Road, and makes a living by

farming. The open space in front of her house is used as a garden. She has two sons and a daughter. The eldest son, Zhu Yongcheng, is 42 years old. The second daughter is married to Dong Yuanfa, a man from the same village (who is 61 years old). The youngest son, Zhu Yongxiang (the deceased, 26 years old), does not engage in proper work and is devoted to wandering. Recently, he became addicted to drugs and repeatedly demanded money from his family. His mother hated him

like a thorn in her side and wanted to remove this thorn in her eye. She discussed this with her son-in-law, Dong Yuanfa, and decided to kill him to prevent future troubles. So, at 4:30 AM on the 23rd, Zhu, accompanied by her son-in-law, went to the garden shed 100 yards from their home with a hemp rope from a vegetable basket (because Yongxiang usually lived there). Taking advantage of Yongxiang's sound sleep, Zhu Zhu took the first step, sitting on Yongxiang's body and holding down his head. Yongcheng used the hemp rope to loop around his neck and

pulled it hard. Within a few minutes, he died. Then, they moved the body to the garden, covered it with grass, and wanted to bury it. However, Yongxiang's death was very tragic, with blood flowing from all seven orifices. Fearing neighborhood criticism, they decided to falsely report it to the police station. So, at 10:30 AM that morning, Dong Yuanfa and Zhu Zhu went to the Yangshupu Police Station to report that Yongxiang had been murdered and requested justice. Chinese detective Su Yinggen went to investigate and found that

the matter was bizarre and contained inaccuracies. He took Zhu Yongcheng to the police station. Under strict questioning, he finally confessed the truth. All three were taken into custody. A hemp rope was found next to the body. The body was first sent to the police hospital to verify that it was strangled to death before death, and then sent to the coroner's office to wait for verification. Yesterday morning, the police station escorted Dong Yuanfa, Zhu Zhu, and Zhu Yongcheng to the Third Criminal Court of the First District. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated the above situation and requested detention. Questioned about Zhu Yongcheng, he confessed that because he

did not engage in proper work, specialized in stealing items, and was addicted to heroin, he repeatedly demanded money from his family. It was really hopeless, so he plotted to kill him. Judge Huang Risheng verified the confession and ordered the three defendants to be returned to custody separately, pending verification of the body. The hearing was rescheduled for December 2.

### Grain - Speculative Market Rice Market - Rumors Abound - Foreign Rice Still Arrives in Shanghai in Large Quantities

Yesterday, foreign rice continued its meteoric rise, with both spot and futures prices rising across the board. The morning saw strong actual sales due to Monday's business, and in the afternoon, speculators spread rumors that Saigon had restrictions and required registration for rice exports. This was the usual tactic of selling short. As a result, spot prices rose by 30 to 40 cents in the morning, and futures rose by one dollar. In the afternoon, spot prices once rose by nearly one dollar, and original package futures rose by one to one and a half dollars. The December 1st futures opened at 82.8 dollars in the morning, then added 20 cents, reaching a maximum of 84.8 dollars in the afternoon. The No. 2 futures reached 13.5 dollars in the afternoon. The December futures opened at only 79.5 dollars in the morning, rising to 80.08 dollars at noon, and 81.5 dollars in the afternoon. The Xiaowen December futures reached 80.34 dollars in the afternoon, and the land cargo was 81.5 to 82.2 dollars. However, before the evening close, large players took advantage of the high prices to exit the market, taking profits and causing the market price to fall by half a dollar. Nevertheless, compared to Saturday, futures were still up by 1.5 to 2 dollars, and spot prices were up by nearly one dollar. The breakdown of prices is as follows: No. 1 Saigon 73.5 to 73 dollars, No. 2 Saigon 69.8 to 68.5 dollars, Huojiao 71.3 dollars, down to 69.5 dollars, No. 2 Siam 67 to 66.5 dollars, Xiaojiao 67 to 66.5 dollars, Tokyo Special Point 63.5 dollars, Rice Zhongguan 58.5 to 58 dollars, Special Grade 61.5 to 61 dollars, Broken Special Grade 58 to 56.5 dollars, Wuhu Special Point 66.5 to 66.7 dollars. The total daily trading volume was over 10,000 bags of spot goods and nearly 1,000 tons of land cargo futures.

In other news, foreign rice continues to arrive in a steady stream. Yesterday, the Taikoo Company's Ganzhou vessel arrived with 11,398 bags from Hong Kong. Also, Jardine Matheson's Mingsheng vessel arrived from Hong Kong with 16,223 bags. Both arrived yesterday morning and docked at the Taikoo Wharf on the Bund in the French Concession and the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. It is said that a large amount of foreign rice will continue to arrive in Shanghai in the future. Currently, it is known that the French vessel Pangu and the French vessel Albert Sarraut, managed by Wah Lun Foreign Firm, as well as Jardine Matheson's Risheng and Yusheng vessels, are carrying large quantities of foreign rice from Hong Kong and are expected to arrive in port within days. (Zu)

A total of 1,000 to 2,000 shi of new japonica and tea varieties have arrived, mostly Zhongguan goods. Sales in this market are still sluggish, causing the price of Zhongguan goods to continue to depreciate by about one dollar. However, particularly high-quality goods are holding firm due to scarcity. The breakdown of prices is as follows: Original package new japonica 92 to 91.5 dollars, measured Zhongguan 85.7 to 84.7 dollars, tea variety measured 80 to 79.5 dollars, wild rice is out of stock, Dujian measured 77 dollars, foreign japonica has no market.

Regardless of whether it is domestic or foreign, glutinous rice has not arrived recently. Inventory is not abundant, causing sellers to be quite firm in their prices. Therefore, although the outflow is not smooth, the market is very strong, with Yiao White still priced at 85 to 83.4 dollars, and Hong Kong White at 77 to 74.5 dollars.

Flour Mills Increase Prices - Actually Implemented - Up One Dollar From Before - Foreign Flour Also Affected

The flour mill price has been changed to 18 dollars, an increase of one dollar from before. This has been brewing for several days since it was first discussed last week. The mills, citing a shortage of raw materials and high costs, obtained the consent of the concession authorities and decided to implement the increase from yesterday. At the same time, Fu Feng Factory is reducing flour production by half due to insufficient raw materials, supplying about 2,500 bags per day. Fuxin Factory has a newly arrived ship of foreign wheat, which can temporarily meet demand and sell about 5,500 bags per day. Altogether, this amounts to about 8,000 bags to meet daily needs. After the market experienced price increases, foreign flour was also immediately affected. Because orders must be placed a month in advance, and with the help of brokers, Shuangting brand is priced at 19.5 dollars and Huashen brand at 19.6 dollars, a sharp increase of 50 to 60 cents compared to last week, with over 3,000 bags traded. Returned flour from the factory, such as Laochezhan, was rumored to reach a high of 20 dollars, but because hoarders were not greedy, it was reported that Tianzhu brand was priced at 19 dollars and 200 to 300 bags were purchased in this market.

The wheat market is also becoming tight. Since the supply from inland areas has been scarce, those holding goods have long been reluctant to sell. In addition, with the flour price increase, sellers have become even more bullish. It is reported that yesterday, Chinese factories have raised prices to 28 dollars, but there have been no significant sales. Except for one or two batches that have been negotiated and priced, the rest have not been officially traded. Japanese factories are currently collecting Huai goods for shipment, and merchants are not selling off. The market is unusually quiet and firm.

Oil Cake - Edible Oil Still Under Manipulation

Yesterday's oil market was still under the control of manipulation. Spot oil prices remained stable, while futures prices fluctuated significantly throughout the day due to differing views among buyers and sellers. The market opened weak in the morning, tightened up later, and then retreated in the middle of the day, eventually closing higher. A total of 30 barrels of Dalian soybean oil were traded at 105 dollars, 100 barrels of Dayou Factory soybean oil at 81.5 dollars, 150 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil at 73.75 dollars, 500 cans of Yantai raw oil at 106.5 dollars, and 50 barrels of Qingdao raw oil at 102 dollars. Over 1,300 barrels were traded for December delivery, with prices ranging from 102.5 to 103.25 dollars, then falling back to -102 dollars, and then rising again to 103.75 dollars.

Also, 800 bags of corn were shipped to Tianjin today.

### Finance - Foreign Exchange Inflows Surge - US Dollar Approaches 6 Yuan

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no change in HSBC's listed rates. The black market for British and American exchanges saw a sudden shift in sentiment, with strong buying interest. Foreign banks such as Arbuthnot Latham were particularly active, so even though some Chinese merchants took profits and sold, the market remained tight. The afternoon was even more bullish, with crowded trading and foreign firms settling accounts. US dollar transactions reached around 2 million. As a result, the British gold closed at 3 shillings 75 pence, and the US dollar closed at 5.9375 yuan, up 0.046875 and 0.0625 respectively from the previous Saturday's close. US dollar futures were even weaker.

Chinese banks were quite receptive after the opening, and the market continued to weaken. Foreign banks entered this month's US dollar at 5.96875 yuan. HSBC announced no change in its listed rates, and the silver equalization tax also remained flat. Suddenly, Chinese speculators came in to buy, but because Chinese banks had ample supply, the trend remained flat. The December trade was at 5.96875 yuan. Subsequently, importing foreign firms demanded, and speculators also settled their positions simultaneously, and the near- and far-term US dollar prices became bullish again. Foreign banks and speculators entered the near-term US dollar at 5.96875 yuan, and the next month fell back to 5.9375 yuan.

### Economic Discussions - Feng Liutang

Copper Yuan as Steel Plate

To discuss why copper yuan are called "copper plates," one must first talk about copper cash.

China has traditionally used copper cash, so cash was a currency that existed from the Zhou Dynasty until very recently when it began to disappear. Originally, cash had a certain weight and fineness, but due to various reasons, it gradually deteriorated to the small cash that we saw later. However, looking at the cash minted during the Shunzhi, Kangxi, and Yongzheng reigns, they were truly worthy of the name. But cash also declined like a family's fortunes. By the Guangxu reign, cash weighing 1.2 fen, or even 0.9 fen, was considered to be of superior quality, and cash weighing around 0.5 fen circulated in the market. The poorer the quality of the cash, the higher the price of goods. Therefore, in June of the 12th year of Guangxu, it was proposed to standardize the form and weight of the cash, hoping to restore the old system within three years. At that time, it was proposed to mint cash by machine, but it was feared that the cost would be too high and that machine minting in Beijing would cause misunderstandings abroad, so it was not done. It was not until the 13th year of Guangxu that an edict was issued to Li Hongzhang, the governor-general of Zhili, to purchase a machine and rush to mint cash at the Tianjin Machine Bureau for use in Beijing. Li Hongzhang further said: "The foreign machine minting method is slightly different from the Chinese mold casting method. From melting copper and rolling it into sheets to making blanks, punching holes, printing characters, and polishing the blanks, everything is done quickly in sequence, and many more factories would have to be built." Therefore, Chinese cash was sent to the Greenwood Iron Factory in England to build machines in the same way, with each cash weighing one qian as the standard. In the third month of the 14th year of Guangxu, the purchased cash minting machine arrived in Tianjin. The cash molds and shipping and insurance fees from abroad to Shanghai totaled £6,212, 10 shillings, and 8 pence, plus the shipping fee from Shanghai to Tianjin, totaling 20,078 taels and 725.2 cents of silver, marking the beginning of China's machine-minted cash.

However, machine-minted cash ultimately could not compete with the old forces, and mold casting remained in other provinces. As for what machine-minted cash was like, we can see from Wen Guang, the governor of Sichuan, in his report on the Sichuan province cash minting method in the 24th year of Guangxu: "Minting relies solely on manual labor, which is different from other provinces that use machines to press cash. The skill and ease of labor are different." This shows that machine-minted cash was superior to manual labor.

In the 26th and 28th years of Guangxu, Guangdong province used machines to mint copper yuan. Thus, China's currency gradually became mechanized. In the 27th year of Guangxu, the provinces were ordered to imitate minting, and the minting quota increased. They only sought to mint cash for use in handling new policies, so they minted more and more, and the quality became worse and worse. At the beginning of minting, one silver dollar could only be exchanged for 80 or 90 copper yuan. In the 28th and 29th years of Guangxu, it could be exchanged for more than 120 copper yuan, and in the interior, it was used at an 80% discount, which was actually the same principle.

When copper yuan first entered the market, they were called "copper jiaozis" in the interior, because they resembled silver jiaozis in style. Later, they were all called "copper plates." As for why they are called "copper plates," this again comes from copper cash.

To discuss "plates," one must go back to before the Qing Dynasty. According to Dong Qiao, a salt merchant in the Ming Dynasty, in his Miscellaneous Records:

"In our hometown, from the beginning of the dynasty (i.e., the beginning of the Ming Dynasty) to the Hongzhi reign, all good cash was used. Every fen of silver was worth seven fen of copper cash (according to the usage in our hometown, wedding and funeral expenses were still calculated at seven wen of cash per fen of silver a few years ago, commonly called "seven shen silver," which shows that this has been a long-standing custom), and there was no difference. However, there was too much picking and choosing, and the best cash was the green cash (the best cash was called green cash). In the Dingchou year of the Zhengde reign, I first traveled to the capital. When I first arrived, I saw that traders all called cash "ban'er," which I found strange and asked about! It turned out that they were using low-quality cash, taking only half the value, but taking the number as it was, without looking at whether it was good or bad, which everyone thought was very convenient. After I returned south, "ban'er" was used in our hometown, and good cash was no longer used. I don't know why there was such a magical connection. After several years, the "ban'er" was picked and chosen again, forgetting the reason for the doubling of value, and still demanding the original number. From then on, silver became expensive and cash became cheap, and the cause started in the capital."

From this, we can see that the reason why copper yuan are called copper plates is probably because of "ban'er." In novels, the author of Dream of the Red Chamber is good at using people's names to satirize the world. He wrote that Granny Liu's son-in-law's nickname was Gou'er. Because he had no relatives who did not collect taxes and no friends who were officials, he had no way to get money, so he called his daughter Qing'er and his son Ban'er. Qing'er means green cash, and Ban'er means inferior cash. This shows that Gou'er only saw money in his eyes. Some say that Sima Xiangru was also named Quanzi, but why is it not so? This is because "parents love him and do not want to rebuke him, so they give him this name." How can this be compared to Gou'er, who is a worldly person?

Now, copper plates are as rare as copper cash, and both have disappeared from the market.

Yesterday's spot gold's black market went upstream, and sentiment strengthened due to the softening of the exchange market. It once reached a high of 5,675 yuan, and the fluctuations were slightly larger. However, trading was very lively, with both large players entering and exiting, so prices fluctuated from time to time. The evening closing price was 5,668 yuan, up 66 yuan from last Saturday's close. Approximately 4,000 taels were traded. The swap buyer silver shop posted 250 taels to the money shop at a price of 6 yuan. The spot price was 5 to 6 yuan lower than the futures price. Jewelry gold in silver shops ultimately did not move, and customs duties were flat.

Spot Gold Up 66 Yuan

In the early morning, the opening foreign exchange announcement was weak, and the price rose. The gold shop first entered the money exchange industry with 30 taels at an opening price of 5,630 yuan. The silver shop then entered the money exchange industry with 20 taels, which was 5 yuan higher, at 5,635 yuan. However, the exchange market was still stable, and silver shops and others sold slightly at this time, stopping the rise and falling back. The silver shop sold 30 taels to the gold shop at 5,615 yuan. Subsequently, due to the purchase by gold shops and others, the market became firm, and the securities brokers entered 20 taels to the gold shop, pushing it up to 5,645 yuan. However, soon after, the money exchange industry sold 30 taels to the securities brokers, pushing it down by more than 20 yuan to 5,620 yuan. In the end, it relied on retail investors to absorb it, reaching 5,650 yuan. The gold shop entered 10 taels to the silver shop. The afternoon situation was wandering. At the opening, the silver shop sold 20 taels to the securities brokers at 5,645 yuan. Later, due to the slight selling of the money exchange industry and others, it fell to 5,630 yuan. However, the foreign exchange trend was weak and bullish, and a buying surge occurred, rising twice to 5,675 yuan, with a large number of transactions in between, and the situation was hot. As a result, the gold shop entered 30 taels to the silver shop at 5,668 yuan, which was the evening closing price for the day, up 66 yuan compared to last Saturday's closing. The overall fluctuation was 60 yuan. The selling price of the spot shop's standard gold was more than 10 yuan higher than that of spot gold, and the purchase price was 30 yuan lower. The current standard gold was 5 to 60 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there was little trading.

Jewelry Gold Still Unchanged

The selling price of jewelry gold per tael in silver shops remained unchanged. Datonghang still listed 580 yuan, and Xintonghang's price was similar to the above price, with the purchase price about 30 yuan lower.

Most Foreign Currencies Rose - Only Japanese Notes Weakened. Yesterday's foreign currency market saw spot gold prices quickly rebound. British and American gold pounds also rose by 1.5 yuan each. British gold notes were slightly in demand, and the market price suddenly rose by 1 yuan. US gold notes rose from 16.27 yuan to 16.6 yuan, up 30 cents compared to last Saturday's closing. Hong Kong notes were in considerable demand, and the market price was strong. Japanese gold notes and Korean notes were weak and trending weaker, with the former at 1.528 yuan and the latter at 1.5 yuan.

Discount Rates Lowered Again - Interbank Lending Rate Rises

Yesterday's discount rate for foreign exchange drafts and notes fell again, with 2.75 yuan per thousand yuan for entering and 3.75 yuan for exiting, down 25 cents from last Saturday. The interbank lending rate of the Money Industry Association rose by 1 point, with both the morning and afternoon markets listing 7 points.

### Securities Speculation, Bullish Rumors, Domestic Debt Reaches New Highs, '96 Bonds Also Soar by 1.7 Yuan

In the informal securities market yesterday, the atmosphere of peace was quite strong, and various rumors were frequently heard, although none have yet been confirmed. However, the market has already been stimulated by them. All five types of Unified Public Bonds have reached new high prices. Despite the continuous release of floating shares, the bullish momentum remains strong, and the absorption by various syndicates is no less than before. In yesterday's market conditions, in the morning, Hongda, Lemao, Lianyi, Tongkang, Yitai, and the 14th bond continued to show appetite, and market prices rose again. Renchang, Hefeng, and Dingkang, along with general retail investors, were actively selling, but this was insufficient to meet the absorption by the bullish parties. The Type B bond also reached a new high price, with '96 bonds rising to 5.5 yuan. In the afternoon, the trend became even more tense, with the atmosphere of peace appearing even stronger. Lemao and Hongda continued to search for shares. Xinfu and Xinhua also came to increase their positions, and others such as the 11th, 25th, and 38th bonds were also bought. Shengda and Tongshun also made purchases. Lianhe, Jufeng, Tongkang, Yichang, and Yitai actively released shares, but all attempts failed. Various public bonds again reached new high prices, with the Type B bond breaking through 8 yuan. As a result, all bonds rose again by 5 or 6 jiao to about 1 yuan, and '96 bonds rose sharply by 1.7 yuan. The total trading volume was approximately 3.6 to 3.7 million yuan. A concise table is listed below:

Stock Trading: 100 shares of Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company were traded at a price of 16.25 yuan per share.

Furthermore, the stock market at the Public Industry Association yesterday showed a stable trend with limited trading. Most operators adopted a wait-and-see attitude, and rubber stocks appeared somewhat lackluster.

### Yarn and Cotton Speculation, Short Covering Rises, Yarn Prices Advance, "Double Horse" Re-enters the 200 Yuan Range

The yarn market continued to rise, and the bullish trend was also strong. This was because those who had previously sold short, in light of the improving environment, and also due to excellent sales of 32-count and 42-count fine yarn thread in Hong Kong, engaged in short-covering activities. As a result, the market gradually advanced, and 20-count "Double Horse" yarn re-entered the 1,200 yuan range. Currently, the lively trading in the market is mainly driven by buying and selling entrusted by small banks, which are devoted to speculative practices, selling on every dip and buying on every rise, thus often creating trends of frantic rises and excessive falls. Today, 230 bales of cotton yarn are being shipped to Hong Kong.

The spot yarn market opened this morning in a seemingly sluggish state because the market conditions had returned to a flat and weak state at the end of last week. The opening price for 20-count "Double Horse" yarn was 1,195 yuan. Once this price opened, there were many sellers, and it fell slightly to 1,189 yuan. After hovering slightly, news of stable foreign exchange and active demand from the Guangdong syndicate caused a sudden surge in buying, and short-sellers returned to cover their positions. As a result, the market price rose step by step to 1,217 yuan. Later, after a certain company released some shares, it fell to 1,205 yuan. However, with the return of the Jinzi syndicate to push up prices, it rose again to close at 1,220 yuan. It is noted that the total trading volume for half a day was 7,105 bales, and the price of 20-count "Double Horse" yarn rose by 20 yuan. The amount bought by each syndicate is listed as follows: Fellow traders: 6,350 bales; Hong Kong: 755 bales. Total: 7,105 bales.

Cotton Prices Slightly Firmer

The current cotton situation is firmer than at the end of last week. This is because the yarn market has risen slightly, bringing a supportive atmosphere to the cotton market. However, apart from Hongzhang, which has some demand, other mills remain mediocre, so the market price has only slightly increased.

The overseas cotton market in New York was very quiet. Later, due to purchases by overseas merchants, the closing price rose by three to four points compared to the previous day. In India, yesterday's price fell by one rupee.

The trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai has been very quiet recently. All parties are adopting a wait-and-see attitude. Mills have little intention of buying, and traders are temporarily unwilling to sell, so trading has been sluggish throughout the day.

### Piece Goods, Factory Cloth Exports Particularly Strong, Selling Prices Rise Again

Yesterday, the factory cloth market turned firmer and more expensive because daily declines had gradually reduced floating shares, factory supplies remained tight, actual demand was continuous, and foreign exchange rates softened. Market sentiment recovered immediately, and traders and customers made some purchases to cover their positions. The selling prices of all cloths were firm. White goods, coarse and fine cloths, and twills each rose by 1 to 2.5 jiao per piece. Dyed cloths rose by 1.5 to 5 jiao. The street traded over 1,200 pieces of various cloths. The Guangdong and Hong Kong brokers purchased 400 pieces of color cloth, fǔchóu, and bleached cloth on credit. The Fujian and Zhejiang brokers purchased 200 pieces of line呢,嗶嘰, bleached cloth, and colored cloth. The Yantai brokers purchased over 100 pieces of bleached and dyed cloths and coarse cloth. Orders for colored and bleached cloth from Siam and other foreign countries amounted to over 3,000 bolts.

Eastern Cloth: Due to the rebound in yarn prices, market sentiment was high. Fine cloth rose sharply by 7 to 8 jiao per piece, and 嗶嘰 rose by a little over 1 fen per piece. Longtou fine cloth closed at 35.1 yuan in the morning and 35.3 yuan in the afternoon. 四君子 嗶嘰 was priced at 1.08375 yuan. There were especially many transactions in mid-range fine cloth on the street, and the trend was even firmer.

Exports: Today, 510 pieces of cotton cloth were shipped to Hong Kong.

Sugar Market: Dutch Sugar Falls by 8 to 9 Jiao

Yesterday's sugar market saw tighter supplies of coarse white sugar, while Dutch red sugar and refined white sugar both continued to ease. The public association's board quoted 24 coarse white sugar at 72.6 yuan for local warehouses and 71 yuan for external delivery. Dutch red sugar was quoted at 55.1 to 55.2 yuan, down 8 to 9 jiao from the previous day (November 22). Taikoo refined white sugar B mark was quoted at 74.4 yuan for Western warehouses, down 1 jiao. DY mark Eastern warehouses were quoted at 67.9 yuan, HX mark at 67.7 yuan, down 4 to 5 jiao, Western warehouses at 68.1 yuan, and HM mark Western warehouses at 66 yuan. Brokers telegraphed to Hong Kong Taikoo to purchase DY mark at HK$13.15 and XH mark at HK$13.05, C.I.F., which requires confirmation upon receipt of a reply today.

Seafood: Domestic Fragrant Mushrooms Firm

Domestic fragrant mushrooms, such as those produced in Fujian, Jiangxi, and Tunxi, usually see new harvests in the late winter. However, recently, transportation to various ports has been obstructed, resulting in extremely scarce supplies. It is observed that existing inventories of aged goods here remain firm. Currently, plain-packaged goods are selling for 510 to 520 yuan, high-packaged goods for around 600 yuan, thick mushrooms for 650 yuan, and winter mushrooms for 700 yuan.

Arrowroot Flour Continues to Rise

With limited supplies of arrowroot flour and brisk sales, its price continues to rise. It is observed that there is a severe shortage of high-quality goods on the market. For example, the Flying Unicorn brand was sold yesterday for 77 yuan, up another 3 yuan from before. Iron Anchor brand was at 65 yuan, Green Double T at 60 yuan, and Double T at 58 yuan.

Fennel Declines

Fennel prices had previously risen continuously in the Shanghai market due to scarce supplies and rising prices at the source, reaching a peak selling price of 310 yuan. However, with declining prices quoted from Hong Kong and the possibility of direct shipments from the production area to Shanghai, the Shanghai market has gradually eased, with prices falling by more than 30 yuan, showing no signs of stabilization.

Coal: Hebei White Coal Opens, Coal Quality Poor, Few Transactions

Hebei white coal, since 7,000 tons of new goods arrived a month ago, had not been traded due to dealers waiting and watching. Yesterday, traders opened the market, quoting Hebei white coal screened lumps at 205 yuan per ton and run-of-mine coal at 175 yuan per ton, ex-warehouse in Pudong, with additional lighterage fees. However, because the coal contains a lot of stony clods and is not easy to burn quickly, transactions were extremely scarce.

Hardware: New Round Iron Higher, Local Nails Still Weak

Although recent transactions in new round iron have not been very brisk, due to soaring overseas prices and high freight costs, traders' costs are high. The asking price after arrival is bound to increase, so yesterday's market prices were slightly higher, quoted at 58 yuan per dan. However, compared to the overseas delivered price of 60 yuan or more, the difference is still quite large. It is observed that only about 200 dan or so were traded yesterday.

The local nail market remains stagnant, with routes to both the north and south cut off. Business on the street is also sparse, with the number of transactions throughout the day being minimal. As a result, those in this business remain pessimistic, and asking prices are also weak, at 95 yuan per barrel.

Flat Galvanized Iron: Today, 3,000 pieces were shipped to Tianjin.

### The Nanjing Municipal School for the Blind and Deaf After Moving to Sichuan

(Jiangjin Correspondence) The Nanjing Municipal School for the Blind and Deaf, which moved to Sichuan, is now located in Jiangjin. The Ministry of Education, in view of the urgent need to provide relief to blind and deaf youth and to promote special education, recently issued a clear order to the school to expand enrollment and add school buildings in the 30th academic year, and to accommodate as many displaced blind and deaf youth from the war zones coming to Sichuan and local areas as possible. This summer vacation, for the sake of cultivating blind and deaf talent, all students with advanced studies will be recommended for further education. Luo Fuxin, a graduate of the blind department's high school normal department, has been approved by the Ministry of Education to be admitted to the Central University. Hu Jiadai, a graduate of the deaf department's vocational class, was recommended to the Wuchang Art College High School to specialize in drawing and engineering. In the future, the educational level of blind and deaf people will gradually improve and obtain equal educational opportunities. The graduates of the deaf department's vocational class this summer vacation have all served society. The cartoon group of the China Film Studio and the Yuxin Steel Factory have all hired graduates of the school. Because of their deafness and focused minds, they are well-suited for diligent work and have achieved excellent service results. In order to produce for national salvation and provide outlets for the blind and deaf, the school has also been allocated a small amount of funding by the Second Social Education Work Group of the Ministry of Education to run production enterprises.

### Guoqiang Middle School Advocates Impromptu Speech Contests

Recently, the private Guoqiang Middle School in this city held an impromptu Mandarin speech contest. Speakers were not allowed to prepare in advance. The topic was only drawn and conceived within five minutes before the competition. The first place student, Gu Borong, drew the topic "The Second Landlord," and when he described the oppression of the tenant class in detail, he vividly portrayed it, winning a lot of applause. As a result, the performance was extremely satisfactory. It is found that this competition method is quite suitable for colleges and universities. In the future, many schools will imitate it.

### Second Baolian Cup Basketball Tournament: Sihai Wins Championship; Overcomes Mixed Team by One Point

The second Baolian Cup basketball league, organized by the Sports Department of the Shanghai Insurance Industry Amateur Association, concluded on the evening of the 23rd of this month at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA after two months of competition. Before the game, Huxing vs. Guanghua and Chengyou vs. Laoyi played exhibition games. Then, Lu Mingjing, the head of the sports department of the association, gave an opening speech, and Sun Guangzhi, the chairman of the association, performed the opening ball. The two sides began to make contact. Feng Baoquan of Sihai made a penalty to open the record. Kong Mingde of the Mixed Team went straight to the basket, creating a two-and-one. In the first half, the two sides tied seven to seven. After the break, the Mixed Team had better coordination and took a four-point lead. Sihai tried hard to catch up. In the last two minutes, center Zhao Liang was fouled for the fourth time and was sent off. Cao Muhong entered the game. Xihai immediately improved and chased to twelve to thirteen. At the end of the game with thirty seconds left, Cao Muhong got the ball from Baoquan again and made another contribution, thus reversing the defeat into victory. When time ran out, Sihai finally won the championship by one point. After the game, Mrs. Yao Yuesun presented the awards.

### Yinqian Cup Table Tennis Tournament: Zhongchu Obtains Final Qualification; Citibank Suffers Crushing Defeat

In the Yinqian Cup table tennis tournament, the perennial champion Zhongchu played against Citibank yesterday at the Zhongchu gymnasium. Citibank, the runner-up of the previous tournament, has been strengthened by the addition of the famous short-stop player Guan Jinbiao. His voice for this year’s championship is quite high. Unexpectedly, because of underestimating the enemy before, he was poisoned by China Central and North America and lost his qualification to win the championship. Yesterday’s battle with Zhongchu was listless. Zhongchu's momentum seemed unstoppable. As a result, Zhongchu won a major victory over Citibank with a score of 13 to 1 and obtained the final qualification. There is still one game left between Citibank and Zhejiang Xing. If Citibank loses to Zhejiang Xing, then this year’s champion will be decided by Zhongchu and Zhejiang Xing. In view of discussing all precedent cases, the competition committee will convene the entire competition committee at the Yinqian Industry Association at 7:00 this morning. I also hope that each team will submit the results of the completed games as soon as possible so that the scores can be calculated and announced.

### I Have Two Widowed Sisters-in-Law

— Yuelian

This is an extremely unfortunate thing. In my family, there are actually two young widows!

They are both my sisters-in-law. My eldest sister-in-law is 26 years old this year. She once studied at a university. She married my elder brother when she was 22 years old. Seven months after the marriage, my elder brother suddenly suffered from neurasthenia and could not be cured for a while, so he stayed in the hospital. But his illness was very serious, and he passed away in the first month of last year.

After my elder brother died, my eldest sister-in-law cried until she fainted. Over the past year, she has always been depressed all day long. As a result, her body has become increasingly haggard. On her desperate, pale face, there are often tears hanging. I have also seen her sobbing into her pillow in the middle of the night.

My third sister-in-law is only 23 years old this year. She was a classmate of my third brother in the same grade. They got married the year before last and were still studying together. Their life after marriage was the envy of everyone.

But good times don't last long, and a painful thing finally happened in the autumn of last year. One day, my third brother came back from school and felt a severe stomach pain. He immediately called a doctor, and after the doctor's diagnosis, it was determined that he had acute appendicitis and had to undergo surgery in the hospital to be saved. So, my father and third sister-in-law accompanied him there. After completing the signing procedures, the hospital performed the surgery. It is said that the situation was very good at the time, and we all thought that there would be no danger.

Who knew that the next morning, we suddenly received a phone call from the hospital saying that my third brother's condition had worsened and his condition was very serious, and that my family should go there quickly. So, we immediately rushed there, but when we arrived at the hospital, my third brother was already lying in the morgue covered with a white sheet.

My third brother died again. A heavy atmosphere of sadness enveloped the family. My mother's sighs and my third sister-in-law's sobs made my heart break even more! The experiences of the two sisters-in-law were really too tragic. They are both women with advanced knowledge, but now they are both buried in the corner of the kitchen, letting painful depression wear away their youth.

"...I really want to die, I'm not afraid, I have nothing to miss." I once saw such words in a book that my third sister-in-law often read. I was slightly shocked and felt that the future of the two sisters-in-law might also be terrible.

I have thought this way, can I help the two sisters-in-law to leave this feudal family and let them get rid of their current pain and do some work for society. I cannot watch the tragedy of the two sisters-in-law happen, so I must use my strength to save them.

But when I thought about the fact that today's society has not completely given women a chance to intervene, I felt that my wishful thinking would not come true. What if my two sisters-in-law have already left the family, but society does not need them, then what can their future life be imagined?

My heart began to be confused. I want to help the two sisters-in-law break the chastity system of this feudal era. I also want to get rid of this courage, because I am afraid that if I fail, I will be cursed by others.

I am wandering between these two thoughts, not knowing which path to take!

Editor's Note: The two sisters-in-law of Ms. (or Mr.) Yuelian are still so young, but they have become widows, which is really an unfortunate thing in the world. But we must know that in today's society, the feudal widowhood system is no longer a glorious emblem. We are using the sharp knowledge knife of the new era to eradicate this inhumane weed. We must seek a kind of life that is the most reasonable and the most beneficial to the social group.

Ms. Yuelian can (and should) use her position in the family to help these two sisters-in-law embark on the path of light. The first step, of course, is to promote the sobriety and awareness of the two sisters-in-law, to let them know the futility and meaninglessness of widowhood, and to let them know that they are still young and should not bury themselves in the feudal widowhood life. Most importantly, they must continue to grow in thought, knowledge, and spirit, and must not become a pool of stagnant water. If possible, they can continue their studies or try to learn a skill and find a place to live, so as not to be parasites of the family forever; within the possible scope, they should remarry when they have the opportunity.

Regarding their future, the most important thing is probably the parents. Ms. Yuelian can gradually explain to the family in a gentle manner and try to convince them. Regarding careers, they can register at the Vocational Women's Department of the YWCA at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Muer Ming Road and ask them to help. Before economic independence, it is best not to leave the family late, so as not to lose the guarantee of life.

Hawthorne replied, "Okay, let's go. I'll accompany you to the police station. Yu Gantang has been detained for more than ten hours, which is enough to give him a considerable stimulus. Now I should release him."

When we came out of the ward and went down the stairs, Ni Jinshou told Hawthorne that He Sheng had also returned to the police station to report. He saw Zhao Boxiong coming out of the Fengtai tobacco and paper shop, and followed him. Unexpectedly, after walking a long way, he finally escaped. He Sheng had no choice but to return to the office in disappointment.

### The Whereabouts of the Dance Queen

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Hawthorne smiled and replied, "He Sheng failed this time. The one he followed out of the tobacco and paper shop was a fake Zhao Boxiong, but the real Zhao Boxiong had become an old man with a white beard and white hair.

Ni Jinshou said in surprise, "An old man with a white beard and white hair? Kang Nian, whom I later sent to Huanghe Road, just came back to report that he followed such an old man to your residence. Could it be Zhao Boxiong in disguise?"

Hawthorne said, "That's him. I've talked to him once, and now I've released him."

Ni Jinshou made another surprised sound and said, "What? Released him? Does he really have nothing to do with it?"

At this time, we had left the gate of the hospital and walked to the car parked there. Ni Jinshou had his own car, and I was still in the same car with Hawthorne. This explanatory conversation could not continue. Although Ni Jinshou was full of doubts, he had to be patient for a while. But as soon as the car arrived at the police station, after Ni Yushou led us into the office, he first drafted a telegram and asked his men to send it to Suzhou immediately. Then he asked Hawthorne to explain his various doubts.

After Hawthorne lit a cigarette, he gave a summary of everything that had just happened in concise terms. Ni Jinshou naturally expressed surprise when he heard this explanation. After Hawthorne finished telling everything he and I had discussed in his residence earlier, he expressed his conclusion of half admiration and half surprise. (177)

### The Struggle of Life

— Yan Zhen

The sky is drizzling, wetting the half-bald plane trees, stretching out their lonely branches. They are even more gloomy, quietly silent. The cold wind blows. Only occasionally does it swing its own trunk, letting the cold wind sweep away the fallen leaves, one by one, flying from its head, some spinning in a vortex, drifting away.

Following the seasons, the autumn colors in our home are also fading! Including this year, Dad has been sick for a full three years. Relying entirely on salary to maintain our lives, Dad's illness has given us such great pressure! Shadows have devoured us. The hearts of young people have grown old! And at this time, how come our relatives and our friends have suddenly disappeared?

The market is sluggish, and under the blazing flames of speculators rushing straight up, they only covet personal interests to fill their private desires. Who has ever cared about the victims under the whip of life?

Indeed, but we have to find a way to live on! Struggle, hard work, the hand-to-hand combat of life has tempered us to be strong! Dad is immersed in the physical and mental pain of change, and three years of suffering can only add some shining white hair to his head. On the contrary, it becomes more resolute and decisive! Our Dad in our eyes is more amiable! But Dad is not a superman after all, and sometimes he cannot help but contain resentment, but only for a moment, his voice is in our ears again: "Young children, what is sadness to us? Life is originally full of twists and turns. If there is no darkness, how will we know the coming of light? With a calm mind, a tenacious spirit, go forward bravely! Then, one day, we will be liberated!" Finally, three years have passed in waves!

Now, Dad is not completely healed, but he can sit up in bed for a few minutes. The winter sun is about to shine on our roof. Although winter is cold, everyone knows that the time when autumn ends and winter ends is when spring comes!

We are chewing on flatbreads and holding oil sticks in our hands. Even the delicate girls have become rough! Today, we are strugglers among the hungry; tomorrow, we will shoulder guns and meet the gentlemen on the battlefield!

### Beiping Opera School Suddenly Closes

— Magpie

Main reason being the financial crisis unable to be maintained. The situation of some students who have nowhere to go is pitiful.

(Special Correspondent in Beiping) The Beiping Opera School, which has a long history of nine years, recently suddenly announced its dissolution. This is indeed unfortunate news in the theater industry.

The Beiping Opera School was established in the 20th year of the Republic of China. The first principal was Jiao Juyin. At the beginning of its establishment, Wang Yaoqing, Yu Shuyan, Mei Lanfang, Cheng Yanqiu, Xun Huisheng, Gong Yun, etc. were hired as members. All the actors came to the school to instruct the students in their acting skills and singing styles. Among them, Wang Yaoqing was particularly attentive. For a period of time, he spent a long time teaching Song Dezhu, Zhao Jinrong, Li Debin, and other students. It can be said that half of Song Zhao and others' fame can be attributed to the inducement of the old offering.

In the past nine years, the number of outstanding people produced by the opera school is not small. In addition to Song Dezhu, Zhao Jinrong (who is now married), and Li Debin mentioned above, there are also Wu Suqiu, Hou Yulan, Li Yuru, etc., who all came from the school. Suqiu and Yulan have gone south many times and performed in Gengxin and Golden, and they all went back to Beiping after singing. Song Dezhu, Zhao Jinrong, and Li Debin also returned to the north with praise to Shanghai. Only Li Yuru has not been to the south because he has not graduated yet, but he is already very popular in Beiping.

This opera school with good achievements was suddenly closed on the 17th of this month! The main reasons for the closure are the financial crisis and the inability to maintain it; secondly, the current principal of the school, Jin Zhongsun, has not been to the school for a long time due to illness, which has led to a situation where no one is responsible. Before the 17th, there were already rumors of dissolution, but the school authorities still had to perform dramas, and at the same time, they did not know what the principal meant, so they still denied the rumors of dissolution in order to reassure the students. On the 17th, they followed Principal Jin's instructions and officially announced the dissolution. On the one hand, they checked the accounts and carried out cleaning. It is said that after the settlement, they still owed 7,000 yuan to the outside world, which had to be taken care of!

After the dissolution of the opera school, the students' future became a major problem. The reporter visited the school yesterday. Generally, students who had homes to go to were either hiring cars or busy tidying up their luggage, and they were all preparing to go home and find other ways to make a living. Those who had no home to go to and whose parents had not yet finished their studies were temporarily staying in the school, waiting for a solution. A part of them individually entrusted various teachers to find a way to introduce them to a way out. Among them, there are many who have not been in school for a long time, such as the students in the Yongzi class. The drama has not yet been completed. Suddenly leaving the school, the troupe cannot be formed. If you continue to study drama, you have to find another teacher to hang out, and this is not a small matter. For the poor students, this is a difficult problem. Because of this, many of those who stayed behind were all frowning and didn't know what to do. The situation was really pitiful!

### Anecdotes from the Shou Chui Hu Studio

Watching Zhou Xinfang's Performance and Discussing the "Qi" School

Zhou Xinfang has long occupied the Jiangnan region, establishing a unique style. Some jokingly call him the "Southern Overlord," which is indeed apt. I would compare him to Qian Liu, who reigned in Zhejiang during the late Tang and Five Dynasties period, possessing a vast territory and a large population. He was isolated and with few to help, yet he endured for a long time. His only shortcoming was his failure to contend for the Central Plains and achieve legitimate dominance. The reason for this can be traced to his voice, which was somewhat hoarse and lacked the flexibility to freely change pitch, making singing difficult at times – this is one reason. Secondly, his pronunciation still retained much of the Southern accent. (For example, in words like "lai" from the "Huai Lai" rhyme, the initial sound is too open, and the added "yi" sound is excessive, resembling the pronunciation of Southern opera. Northerners find it jarring, calling it "piao" (撇雅切). Additionally, entering tones (入聲字) that have merged into the level, rising, and departing tones in the Central Plains dialect – such as the words "de," "bu," and "di" – Zhou Xinfang still pronounces them with the entering tone sound.)

However, in terms of acting and expression, looking at performers from both the North and South, none of his contemporaries can compare. Xinfang inherited several strengths from his father: first, he spared no effort, performing double-bill programs with unwavering dedication; second, he excelled at expressing sorrowful tones, his voice both skillful and poignant, bringing tears to the eyes of listeners. Many women in the audience would weep. If he could also sing in a high register, he would be like a tiger with wings, completely overwhelming everyone else, leaving them with nowhere to earn a living. However, because Xinfang's voice lost its smoothness early in his childhood, he devoted himself to studying scripts and practicing movements. Listening to his recent voice, it is better than it was when he played Han Xin. All of this comes from hard work. Furthermore, because he was born in the middle years of the Guangxu era and was already in his twenties by the early Republic, his foundation in acting was solid. At the time, there were also many excellent performers to serve as models for him. The old performers who sang in Shanghai for a long time, Lao San Mazi (Wang Hongshou), Xiao Liansheng, Pan Yueqiao, and Wang Yufang (a student of the old Peking opera performer Wang Jiuling, specializing in old male roles, with a vast repertoire, and also Xinfang's father's peer) – these were all emulated by Xinfang.

Today, among the younger performers in the Jiangnan region who study the "Qi" school, it is hard to count them all. Lacking Xinfang's foundation in childhood, and without so many good performers to observe, and lacking Xinfang's innate talent, they can only grasp the superficial aspects and fail to penetrate the essence of the art. Xinfang is also like Hu Shih, the creator of vernacular literature. Hu succeeded in creating vernacular literature because he had a foundation in classical literature. Many people under the banner of the "Qi" school lack a profound classical education, so it is no wonder that they can only produce crude vernacular. The result of this crudeness is an excessive freedom, which is unsuitable for both old and new plays. It can only entertain the slow-witted masses in the countryside and cannot be considered the highest form of theatrical art.

In summary, Xinfang's movements and acting can be learned, but his singing cannot. Learning what can be learned, even if one cannot reach his level, can cure the disease of insensitivity. Learning what cannot be learned, even if one achieves a high degree of similarity, will inevitably lead to crudeness and a lack of refinement. Let me make another comparison to eating crabs. The crab meat is indeed exquisite, but the shell, bones, and mud in the stomach must be discarded. If one does not choose carefully and swallows it whole, how much of the delicious flavor will be left? Xinfang is truly a Yangcheng Lake crab. After watching him act and sing, listening to others feels bland. He can be called a supremely beautiful phenomenon!

### The Shanghai Drama School Will Perform "The Monkey King"

— Yun

The Shanghai Drama School has been established for less than a year, but its performances are quite remarkable. This week, at the Sasoon Theater, they will present "Full House of Happiness" and "The Monkey King." "Full House of Happiness" is also known as "A Bed Full of Tablets," also named "The Complete Tale of Beating the Golden Bough," is an auspicious play. It is performed in a lighthearted and lively manner. The play begins with the Prince of Fenyang celebrating his birthday and his seven sons and eight sons-in-law visiting the Guo residence to offer congratulations. It then goes through the events of "Drunkenly Beating the Golden Bough," "Crying in the Golden Palace," "Tying the Son to the Palace," "Pardoning and Bestowing the Sword," and "The Princess Begging for Forgiveness," up to "Husband and Wife Reconciling." The entire play lasts eight quarters of an hour. As for "The Complete Tale of the Monkey King," the stage is filled with little monkeys, all played by lively and innocent elementary school students, jumping and dancing, which is captivating. The play includes scenes such as "Stealing Immortal Peaches," "Stealing Wine from the Jade Pond," "Drunkenly Storming the Heavenly Palace," "Stealing the Elixir," "Heavenly Kings and Generals Teasing the Monkey King," "The Twenty-Eight Constellations," "Gods Trapping the Monkey with a Heavenly Net," "Continuous Battles," and "Erlang and the Celestial Hound Capturing the Monkey to Report Back." The scenes are lively and filled with exciting highlights.

Game No. 227: All-Around Street Fighting, Devised by Chuan Rongnian, with a Subtle Solution: Red Moves First to Win

We welcome responses to this game, with a deadline of ten days. Those who provide the correct solution will receive a small reward. Please affix sufficient new postage to your submissions and send them directly to Chuan Rongnian at No. 81, Lane 1027, East Broadway Road. The explanation of the opening method for Game 72 is as follows:

When Black moves the Elephant Path Pawn first, the chess world calls it "Immortal Path." Its significance lies in observing the opponent's response. If Red uses the Central Cannon and Black is skilled at using the Screen Horse defense, it will inevitably become an easy attack for Red. Therefore, Red should move the Cannon to the seventh file. Black's move of Elephant 3 advancing to 5 is a steady move. Among the variations, only Pawn 7 advancing 1 and Soldier 7 advancing 1 are somewhat unexpected, but if both sides respond appropriately, the game will be evenly matched.
