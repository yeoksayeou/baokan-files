Military Spokesman Refutes Propaganda

Chongqing: A Central News Agency reporter, hearing that the Japanese military reporting department had a broadcast on the night of the 18th regarding the Chinese army's propaganda minister, specifically asked the Chinese Military Affairs Commission spokesperson for their opinion. The response was as follows: Although the Japanese military's propaganda clearly stated that it was aimed at the Chinese side, they have been unable to strongly defend the points where the Chinese side pointed out the contradictions in the Japanese military's false propaganda, and instead fabricated rumors, claiming that the Chinese side had spread the news that Nanning had been recaptured. We can know the Japanese military's intention, which is nothing more than to use this propaganda to counter-stimulate their scattered morale and appease the resentment of the people. However, regarding the recapture of Nanning, the Chinese side has not yet made an announcement. The Japanese making this propaganda is tantamount to shooting at nothing. Moreover, the Chinese army (has not yet begun the attack on Nanning) had already publicly announced this to Chinese and foreign journalists on December 27 of last year. Since the Japanese are inwardly panicked, they should defend themselves properly. Why fabricate rumors? What is even more strange is that the Japanese, invading from north of Yong, have been struggling within the Chinese interior line from beginning to end. They are constantly being surrounded and attacked by the Chinese army from all sides. Yet, they still claim to be carrying out a main force encirclement and annihilation battle. But facts speak louder than words. Because the result of the Japanese so-called encirclement and annihilation battle has enabled the Chinese army on the Yongbin Road to advance from Jiutang to Sitang, while at the same time forcing the Japanese army to retreat from Batang to Santang. Leaving aside everything else, just taking this one place, the Chinese army has gained Batang, Qitang, Liutang, Wutang, and Sitang. Can this still be called "寸土 (every inch of soil)"? Moreover, Batang, Qitang, Liutang, Wutang, and Sitang are all key points. We have not heard the Japanese publicly announce their withdrawal to this day. Can this still be called "自動放棄 (automatic abandonment)"? If the Japanese army can stage such an encirclement and annihilation battle again, China would certainly welcome it. The Japanese invasion this time has been acting within the Chinese pre-planned strategy from the beginning. The Japanese realized this early and implemented their so-called brave retreat very quickly. It is truly as the Chinese and Guinan soldiers and civilians stated in their telegram on the 11th, only achieving one or two tenths of the Chinese anticipated war results. We have long known that the Japanese invasion this time is clearly fighting against two enemies: one is the Chinese army, and the other is the Japanese people at home who are tired of war. They must try their best to achieve something to intimidate their people, and there is a very urgent need. This battle concerns their life and death. How can there be anything called "(automatic abandonment)"? (20th Dispatch)

### Food Panic Occurs in Tianjin; Crowds Demonstrate in the Italian Concession

Tianjin: Yesterday, a demonstration took place in the Italian Concession, with no fewer than a thousand participants, all shouting "We want big cakes to eat" and "We want flour to use." Later, the demonstrators were dispersed by the Italian Concession police with fire hoses. According to the Yong Bao, due to a flour-snatching trend in the Chinese area, most of the flour shops have closed. On one occasion, a mule cart carrying 40 bags of flour was seen by a group of residents, who demanded that the owner sell them at a price of ten yuan per bag. The owner refused, so the crowd looted all the flour. Currently, flour has risen to twenty yuan per bag in the concessions here, and white sugar is nineteen yuan and fifty cents per ten pounds. Many people here believe that the current soaring food prices are due to bulk purchases and speculation. At the same time, the anticipated depreciation of bank notes here is making people feel particularly distressed. (20th United Press Dispatch)

Tianjin: Because the price of flour has risen to more than twenty yuan per bag, and other foodstuffs have also risen sharply, impoverished Chinese people launched food riots in the Chinese area this morning. The details are still unclear. It is reported that yesterday, a truck full of flour was attacked by a violent crowd in the Italian Concession. Later, the police and fire brigade arrived to disperse the crowd. The food situation is rapidly deteriorating, especially for flour, rice, and sugar, all of which have seen soaring prices. Since the Chinese people mainly eat rice and flour, they are suffering the most. (20th Reuters Dispatch)

Tianjin: In order to curb the rising price of flour, the French Concession authorities are now selling it at a flat price of fifteen yuan per bag, which is three yuan and fifty cents less than the market price this morning. (20th Havas News Agency Dispatch)

Beiping: There is a shortage of rice, flour, and meat here, and a serious situation has developed regarding people's food. The price of rice rose to an unprecedented figure yesterday, reaching one hundred yuan per bag. The shortage of meat is due to the fact that butchers made very little profit during the Lunar New Year and are unwilling to resume slaughtering pigs and sheep. Today, restaurants and taverns are only getting limited amounts of meat, and meat vendors have no meat to get. It is reported that many butchers have been fined for selling meat at prices higher than the official fixed price. According to a Chinese newspaper, the authorities are now making every effort to find new supplies to alleviate the people's difficulties. A large batch of Japanese military flour has already arrived in Tanggu and is expected to arrive in Beiping within days. Nearly 20,000 bags of flour have already arrived in Beiping and will be distributed to various food merchants so that those who hold "flour coupons" can purchase them with the coupons. There is also a shortage of coal in Beiping. To ease the situation, coal merchants are now selling briquettes and other types of coal at cost. (20th Reuters Dispatch)

Tianjin: Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the price of flour in the city has risen about sevenfold, and the general poor people are suffering unspeakably. This morning, flour-snatching incidents occurred in the Chinese area, with as many as six flour stores being looted. Yesterday, several trucks, full of flour, were almost intercepted and looted by thugs while passing through the Italian Concession on their way to the Chinese area. Fortunately, a team of Italian soldiers arrived to suppress them, and firefighters used water hoses to disperse the thugs. The reason for the rising flour prices is the depreciation of currency, and the depreciation of currency is due to the acute shortage of flour on the market, with merchants rushing to buy from other ports. This is a vicious cycle, and the rising tide of flour prices has become uncontrollable. (20th Havas News Agency Dispatch)

Editorial

### Germany and the Far East

In the past two or three days, international telegrams have repeatedly involved Germany and the Far East. Like a lone footstep in an empty valley, the feeling it gives us is extraordinarily profound. We would like to take this up and elaborate on it.

Germany and China have always had harmonious state relations, and the friendship between the people is particularly strong. Germany and Japan once became close through the Anti-Comintern Pact. But in reality, the footholds that Germany cultivated in the Far East, and its vested interests with the Far East, were fundamentally destroyed by Japan's declaration of war on Germany twenty-five years ago. What remains is the continuous cultural communication between China and Germany; the normal trade between China and Germany three years ago, which flourished and made rapid progress; and the loyal service of German experts in China over the years, which has established an unshakeable mutual trust between the two peoples. When Germany engaged in war in Europe, although it once diligently showed favor to Japan due to the brewing of the horizontal and vertical alliances of Eurasian countries, it ultimately became almost alienated from the Far Eastern issue due to the contradictions and constraints. But at this moment, it has been reported that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop has dispatched Herr Schiefferlich as a special envoy, traveling all the way to Tokyo to study the current situation and future of German-Japanese relations. This is because he sees Japan's tendency to sacrifice Germany and observe England, and is trying to salvage the situation; he is also observing the rise and fall of pro-German and pro-British forces in Japan, and seeking the truth about the possibility of Japan's assistance to Germany and the Soviet Union; if he truly gains nothing from Japan, he will parallel the Soviet Union and restore its aid-China policy. (The full text of the telegram was published in the news column of this newspaper on the 19th.) It was also reported that a newspaper in Stuttgart, Germany, wrote about the Sino-Japanese War, which was quite insightful, saying that "unless Japan decides to reach an understanding with Chinese Chairman Jiang, the Chinese issue will be almost impossible to resolve;" "In short, 1940 will be a critical juncture for Japan." In addition, there were rumors with some discussions. (The full text of the telegram was published in the news column of this newspaper today.) These two pieces of news are not enough to diagnose Germany's definitive intentions towards the Far East in the future, but it can be generally seen that the German government and public have never neglected the Far East during their busy military affairs.

Germany considers the European issue to be the focus of its national policy, so it regards everything outside of Europe as a foil, treating it like a straw dog. Especially half a year ago, when the international situation was chaotic, Germany's aspirations were far-reaching and its ambitions were grand. As a result, its measures concerning the Far Eastern issue could not be impartial, and it often swayed back and forth between them. Unfortunately for China, it was directly and indirectly affected by its negative impact, which is what Chinese people are extremely heartbroken about. But because they are familiar with Germany's national policy, they have always been tolerant and forgiving, so that they can still maintain the friendship between the two peoples without spoiling it. This is what Chinese people are confident that they have not let Germany down. Now, as the European war is about to enter its sixth month, the division of friends and enemies among European countries, apart from the belligerents, is still in extreme ambiguity. However, the international situation is clearly very different from half a year ago. There are too many things to describe, but the more important ones related to the Far East are: China has the instinct and determination to resist Japan, so its continued resistance will not be slightly hampered by the European war. The important significance of this lies in the fact that no country can obstruct China's war of resistance for independence and self-preservation, which also means that no country can protect Japan to stop China's war of resistance. All those who plan for themselves, or for Japan, and attempt to stop China's war of resistance, will inevitably fail. This is the international reality today, and it also determines the important factors of the international situation in the future. This is the first point. Japan has lost most of its strength by invading China, and the European war has not given Japan a better situation and opportunity that is unfavorable to China. That is, after Japan is "stuck" by China, it loses its strength and qualifications to participate in other international issues. Therefore, even if any party in the European belligerent groups colludes with Japan, it will be a completely meaningless move for the future of the European war. This is the second point. If the European disputes stop at a posture of flexing muscles and not at a real war with real swords, then Japan will use Germany to threaten England in order to obtain better conditions in the Far East. If the relationship between Germany and the Soviet Union is still in a state of opposition, then Japan will use anti-communism to make friends with Germany in order to cover up its arguments for invading China. The reason for Japan's seemingly close relationship with Germany in the past lies entirely in this. When the relationship between Germany and the Soviet Union changed and the European war broke out, although Japan's pro-Germanists occasionally published intermittent pro-German rhetoric to cover up their original faces and to attack England's weaknesses, in reality, they absolutely no longer attempt to strengthen German-Japanese relations, bringing trouble upon themselves. What they seek is that if they can get England and the United States to compromise and fulfill their ambitions to invade China, they will not hesitate to strike Germany as a condition. This can be clearly proven everywhere in their political changes and diplomatic words and deeds. This is the third point. Japan has not declared neutrality in the European war, intending to wait for a good price to sell itself. China has not declared neutrality in the European war either, because it recognizes only one antagonistic relationship, and does not ask about others and treats them equally. In other words, Japan is sinking and watching for changes, and if there is any possible opportunity, it will only prepare to throw stones down the well, just like it did twenty-five years ago. China is simultaneously working hard on resisting Japan and building the country, and is happy to accept the sympathy and assistance of friendly countries, or any mutually beneficial ways, regardless of size. It also deeply believes that the struggle in the European war is in Europe, and that China's future relationship with any country in Europe will not be affected by the victory or defeat of that country in the European war, and there will be no favoritism or discrimination. This is because, during the war of resistance, although it expects many friendly countries, the nation-building enterprise requires even more friendly countries. This, in Japan, is determined to swallow alone, and under the exclusive possession, the "排他 (exclusive)" principle applies to any country. This is the fourth point.

The above four points have been clearly demonstrated through the test of the European war over the past six months. The German government and public, in the midst of their busy military affairs, pay attention to the Far East. Are they using these four points as a reference? Then, whether they can actually provide any assistance to China's war of resistance is another question. However, what they have aspired to from Japan in the past six months should now be abandoned and they should know where to return to.

### Learning Starts Anew After the Winter Vacation: Chairman Chiang Sends Telegram Urging the Nation's School Principals and Faculty to Take Responsibility for Moulding Youth Nationwide So They Can Shoulder the Responsibility of Post-War Reconstruction

Guiding Student Thought, Moulding Student Character, Managing Student Life, Forging Student Physical Strength, Developing Student Personality, Promoting National Morality

Chongqing – As the winter vacation comes to an end and the new term begins, Chairman Chiang sent a telegram to principals of major and minor schools nationwide, reiterating the gist of his speech at the Education Conference in early March last year, urging principals and faculty at all levels to take responsibility for guiding students' thoughts and character, enhancing their physical and mental strength, in order to create youth with ambition and ability, and to pioneer a new destiny for the nation. The telegram stated briefly: The future of the nation and the people hinges on the quality of the citizens, and the cultivation of healthy citizens depends solely on the principals and faculty of schools at all levels. At the Third National Education Conference last year, I earnestly expounded this principle, hoping that all colleagues in the education sector would embrace the Three Principles of the People, promote our nation's inherent morality, respect the teacher's role, emphasize moral education, strengthen the nation's will to resist aggression, establish a spirit of active national reconstruction, and enrich the nation's long and rich vitality. In particular, I stressed that cultivating national character is the fundamental task of the education sector. Before and after the conference, I further stipulated the four cardinal principles of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame as common school mottos, announced the Twelve Articles of Conduct for Party Members as the code of conduct for youth, and convened a meeting of principals and moral education personnel from secondary and higher schools in Sichuan Province to encourage them to establish a revolutionary outlook on life and inspire national patriotism. Time flies, and now it has been a year. As the winter vacation comes to an end and the new term begins, it is time for schools at all levels to review past work and determine future plans. I would like to elaborate further on the responsibility of educators in guiding students' thoughts and character and enhancing their physical and mental strength. Our resistance war today is the most intense struggle for survival in the history of the Chinese nation and the only pivot upon which the rise and fall of our nation depends. The significance of this war lies, on the one hand, in seeking the survival of our nation, and on the other hand, in creating the Republic of China as a modern nation full of vitality and promise in the midst of the hardships and difficulties of wartime. Only then can we fulfill our responsibility. Therefore, in my speech to the National Education Conference last year, I stated that our focus in education should not only be on wartime but also on the post-war period. In terms of the current environment, today, with our will concentrated and our spirits high, is the best opportunity to mold national character and lead the nation forward. In terms of the nation's future, only by seizing this opportunity, unifying the goals of the nation, and improving the thinking of the people can the youth across the nation have the ability to pioneer the future destiny of the nation and shoulder the responsibility of post-war reconstruction. Only then, on the day of victory in the resistance war, can China smoothly complete the construction of a new nation based on the Three Principles of the People, and lay the foundation for lasting peace and stability. In terms of the nation's actual needs, not to mention the recovery of our lost territories, which depends on countless capable, determined, and courageous compatriots rising up to fight, even after the end of the victorious resistance war, domestic public and private construction will be severely damaged, and the economy and industry will be devastated. It will require the people of the whole country to endure hardship and labor, to be accustomed to an austere life, and to be courageous in overcoming difficulties to be able to shoulder the great task of building the nation in extraordinary times. In short, only with a healthy and courageous citizenry can we achieve the great feat of revival and national reconstruction. Only with dedicated and diligent compatriots can we accomplish the great cause of revolution. All these efforts to nurture new citizens require all of you who are in charge of education to exert your perseverance, unleash your enthusiasm, and work tirelessly. Since the start of the resistance war, I have seen the progress made by our young citizens in various aspects, and I have also seen the shortcomings of the lack of center and essence in our country's education ten or twenty years ago. I cannot but earnestly hope that the principals and faculty of schools at all levels will seize this opportunity and assume the responsibility of carrying on the past and opening up the future for our nation, which has a glorious history of five thousand years and an infinitely rich future. I believe that hardship during wartime is a matter of course. If there are shortcomings in our material resources, financial resources, or even politics and society, they can be remedied. However, the cultivation of national character, which is fundamental to the security and survival of the nation, is of paramount importance. If educators can make every effort in this regard, their achievements will be far greater than anything else. Looking back on the past two years of the resistance war, those on the front lines who risk their lives in the face of danger and are willing to die in the line of duty, creating extraordinary achievements in battle, and those in the rear who undertake various practical tasks with composure and diligence, fulfilling their responsibilities and making great contributions to the resistance war, when asked about their lives, have all benefited from the edification and cultivation of good teachers during their school days. Because they have a solid foundation in their character, even if their academic skills are not particularly profound, they can still display the spirit of learning diligently through hardship and achieving a hundredfold with one's own efforts. Therefore, educators should know what to choose between the fundamentals and the secondary. Recently, the enemy's power has been exhausted and its quagmire has deepened, and our final victory is approaching day by day. It is urgently necessary to think about the long-term future of the nation for the next hundred years. I earnestly hope that the principals and faculty of schools at all levels, from elementary to university, will resolutely shoulder the responsibility of guiding students' thoughts, cultivating students' character, managing students' lives, exercising students' physical strength, and developing students' personality. It must be known that the transmission of knowledge and skills only occupies a part of the function of education. If it is not instilled with the spirit of loving the country, loving the nation, and loving compatriots, and tasked with the responsibility of bearing the rise and fall of the nation and completing the national revolution, taught to recognize the times, recognize the country, face the world squarely, and envision the meaning of the future, given a copper-skinned, iron-boned physique capable of enduring all kinds of hardships and difficulties, and inspired with the ambition to persevere, then the acquisition of skills will only drift with the environment or waste away in vain, and will not benefit the nation. I have devoted myself to the revolution and spent half my life in the military, but since establishing the Whampoa Military Academy, I have never abandoned my career as an educator. I know the joys and hardships of this very well. I believe that today, schools at all levels must take responsibility for leading students in terms of thought, striving to avoid empty dreams that are divorced from reality, and striving to avoid the illusion of success by chance, so that they all recognize the national revolutionary cause as the expression of the Chinese nation's will to survive for thousands of years, and thereby establish an unwavering belief in the Three Principles of the People as the principles of national construction. In terms of character cultivation, they must rely on common school mottos and the youth code of conduct to create a common habit of being polite, righteous, honest, responsible, and disciplined, and to promote the inherent morality of our nation, teaching them to sacrifice themselves to benefit the group as the primary duty of life, and to dominate the universe and create the future as the highest meaning of life, and especially to carry forward the history of the Chinese nation as the common ambition of the Chinese people. In terms of life guidance, they must be taught to be frugal, to endure hardship, to exercise their bodies, to be persevering and strive, to be meticulous and disciplined, to be quick and efficient, and to strictly observe regulations and obey laws, so that they are worthy of being members of modern citizens. In addition, the guidance and supervision of extracurricular reading and extracurricular activities, the emphasis on public morality and public welfare, and the cultivation of habits of mutual assistance and cooperation must be carried out at all times and in all places with the same diligence as parents teaching their children, and further to provide close and thoughtful supervision. Students and principals and teachers are in contact with each other from morning to night, living together, and there is no one who is not gradually influenced and transformed. In short, the loose, arrogant, selfish, and self-serving habits left over from education in the past ten or twenty years should be absolutely despised by young students and regarded as the dregs of the outdated era. If there is one student in our schools at all levels who does not love the country, does not obey discipline, cannot respect teachers, or cannot love classmates, then our principals and faculty responsible for supervision should regard it as a shame that is deeply etched in their bones. On the one hand, I also hope that the principals and faculty will accept my consistent views on national education, set an example, and respect teachers, so that students can learn from each other and achieve practical results. Although education in China is not universal, the total number of students in large, medium, and small schools across the country should be no less than 20 million. If they lead the nation and continue to provide the nation with the backbone for resisting aggression and building the nation, then there will be a bright future for China, and after the success of the national revolution, the Chinese nation will greatly contribute to the promotion of world peace and human well-being. Then, you will not let down the country or the students, and you yourselves will become the mainstay in creating the nation's destiny and transforming the world's fortunes, and will receive the endless respect of future generations. Your careers may be extremely arduous, but your achievements are limitless. I earnestly hope that the principals and faculty of schools at all levels will accept my humble words and put them into practice. The country will be fortunate, and the nation will be fortunate.

### The United States Does Not Want to Initiate a Leading Role: Resolving the US-Japan Dispute; Hull's Statement to Newspaper Reporters; US Newspapers Strongly Advocate Economic Sanctions Against Japan

Washington – US Secretary of State Hull told newspaper reporters yesterday that the US government does not plan to take the lead in resolving US-Japan disputes. Hull's comments were in response to news from Tokyo that officials from the Japanese Foreign Ministry suggested that the US should take the lead in improving US-Japan relations. Hull stated that there are currently no new developments in US diplomacy toward Japan. (20th dispatch from the Taiwan Public News Agency)

New York – The "New York Daily News" published an article yesterday stating, "Now is the time to put pressure on Japan." The newspaper further advocated implementing a ban on arms exports to Japan. The newspaper declared, "The golden opportunity has arrived to adopt the most likely insurance policy to oppose the Japanese warlords who are ambitious to conquer the world. We must impose an embargo on Japan until Japan agrees to withdraw its troops from China and proves to us that they can keep their promises." (20th dispatch from the United Press)

Washington – The newly appointed member of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Mr. Nee, issued a warning yesterday that the United States will be drawn into the vortex of war, and the administration has not tried to prevent it. Only an early end to the European war can prevent the United States from being drawn into the vortex of war. He viewed the suggestion to impose an embargo on Japan as a "direct incitement to war." He firmly believed that repealing the Neutrality Act on arms embargoes would remove the obstacles to the United States being drawn into the vortex of war. He predicted that the current export of arms and war materials to Europe will be a precursor to the United States becoming involved with the belligerent countries, and will eventually lead to being drawn into the vortex of war. Mr. Nee said, "We are following the same path as in 1915. The similarity between the policies of the past and the present is very mysterious." Mr. Nee also said that Welles' mission to Europe was similar to the mission of the House of Representatives expeditionary force during the Wilson administration. Mr. Nee pointed out that the embargo proposal would inevitably lead to retaliation. He said, "If an embargo can prevent Japan from invading China, why don't we use the Neutrality Act in the Far East and implement an embargo by maintaining neutrality? This embargo would not harm China, because we can't assist China in any way. However, an embargo would be harmful to Japan. Now we have failed to do so. On the contrary, we are now demanding a unilateral embargo on Japan. If the American people knew that imposing an embargo on Japan would lead to war, I don't believe the American people would want to impose an embargo on Japan. The fact is that we have learned nothing from the lessons of the last war. Re-implementing the arms embargo clause in the Neutrality Act is the safest way for us to pursue peace."

### Roosevelt on a Ship Inspecting Defense, with Special Emphasis on the Canal Zone

New York – After President Roosevelt left the United States on the cruiser "Houston" for vacation, he hosted newspaper reporters for the first time on the US destroyer "Lang." President Roosevelt had a lengthy discussion on defense issues, but requested that the reporters keep it a secret. It is said that he believes that the entire defense policy of the Western Hemisphere has the same impact on every independent American republic as it does on the United States. When a reporter asked whether this sea cruise would involve meetings with European politicians, President Roosevelt smiled and said he had no comment. He then said that for the sake of public interest, it seemed best not to announce the specific locations he would visit. He will visit the coast of Costa Rica on Sunday, February 2nd. President Roosevelt also said that since his visit to Panama in 1924, he has doubted the effectiveness of the canal's defenses. He believes that a third set of locks is extremely necessary and hopes that this session of Congress will allocate $150 million to build these locks. President Roosevelt concluded by saying that he will inspect the canal's defenses on the Pacific side on his return trip and will meet with canal officials and the President of Panama.

### The Future of Chinese Industry is Limitless: US Commissioner to the Philippines' Wife Advocates Lending to Cooperatives

Manila – The wife of the US High Commissioner to the Philippines, Mrs. Sayre, gave a speech here today on the issue of Chinese industrial cooperatives, to support the work of the Philippine Association for Chinese Industrial Cooperation. According to Mrs. Sayre, US$5.70 invested in a Chinese industrial cooperative can enable a Chinese worker to maintain a livelihood. Funds invested in Chinese industrial cooperatives can earn interest of 6% to 8%. The International Committee in Hong Kong is in charge of this, and after the loan is repaid, this money can be used for construction projects. Furthermore, the future of the Chinese industrial movement is truly limitless. Mrs. Sayre continued to talk about the development of Chinese cooperation, saying that there are currently 1,300 Chinese industrial cooperatives, but the goal is 30,000. We hope that China's economy will change in the future and that the living standards of countless people will be raised. However, what is most urgently needed is capital. As for raw materials and skilled workers, there are many, and the market is also very strong. For any commodity, those who can truly exert their strength in an instant, according to estimates from some sources, if one US dollar is used for industrial cooperation, it can be transformed into a rate of one million dollars later.

### Hawaiian Naval Commander, Admiral Marvin, Retiring: to be Succeeded by Admiral Bloch

Washington – The Navy announced yesterday that Rear Admiral Bloch, former commander of the main battle fleet of the US Fleet, has succeeded Rear Admiral Marvin as commander of the 14th Naval District at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Rear Admiral Marvin will retire on May 1st. He reached the retirement age of 64 on April 13th. (20th dispatch from the United Press)

### The Eastern News Publishes an Article Criticizing the Nine-Power Treaty

Tokyo – The "Nichi Nichi Shimbun" carried an article today rejecting the Nine-Power Treaty, which guarantees the territorial and administrative integrity of China, saying that the existence of this treaty only serves to prevent Japan's advance in China. This treaty also restricts China's freedom and treats China as a country that cannot enjoy full citizenship among the countries of the world. It also said that the real effect of this treaty is only to exert pressure on Japan. Japan's abolition of the Nine-Power Treaty can give China greater sovereignty and independence than it can obtain under this treaty. (20th dispatch from Reuters)

### Japan's Ambitions are Endless: Pursuing a Southern Advance Policy; Formulating Plans for Developing Aviation and Maritime Transport; Attempting to Extend Economic Influence to Southeast Asia

Tokyo – A certain newspaper here published a brief message on the 18th of last month stating that General Koiso had gone to inspect the Japanese-mandated islands in the Pacific. When he departed, he had not yet taken office as Minister of Colonial Affairs. People generally believed that this trip had an unofficial mission to conduct an on-the-ground investigation to finalize the government's planned activities in the Southern Pacific, in preparation for their implementation. In reality, the Japanese government does indeed intend to expand its economic influence in the South Pacific. It has been decided to add a Colonial Affairs Bureau within the Ministry of Colonial Affairs, with two sections: South America and Southeast Asia. The ministry's research department has also decided to expand its scope to study plans for Japanese migration to South America and Southeast Asia. The Ministry of Finance has, in principle, accepted all the necessary expenses for this. In addition, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will expand the section of the Eurasian Bureau that handles South Pacific affairs into a Southeast Asia Bureau, with one director, two section chiefs, four secretaries, and ten administrative officials, with an estimated budget of 200,000 yen, which should be unanimously approved by the House of Representatives. The bureau's two sections will be responsible for the affairs of Thailand (i.e., Siam), French Indochina, and the Dutch East Indies, and the other will be responsible for the two dominions of Australia and New Zealand and other areas of the South Pacific. In addition, the Ministry of Communications is conducting a thorough study of the plan proposed by the Aviation Bureau, and it is expected that the expenses will be approved by the House of Representatives, so that the air route from Yokohama to Palau Island (southeast of the Philippine Islands) can be extended from July 1st. One line will extend west from Palau Island, passing through Yap Island, Truk Island, Ponape Island, and Kosrae Island (all in the Caroline Islands) to Jaluit Island (in the Marshall Islands), a total of 2,600 miles. Another line will extend north from Truk Island to Saipan Island (in the Mariana Islands), a distance of 744 miles. These routes will be served by Japanese-made Archie aircraft, each capable of carrying 20 passengers. The route from Palau Island to Jaluit Island will take about 20 hours, while the route from Truk Island to Saipan Island will take only about six hours. It is also learned that the Ministry of Communications has now made the following decisions: (1) To build ships with a displacement of 5,000 tons to sail between Japan and New Caledonia Island (in Oceania, belonging to France). (2) All companies building these ships and operating the routes will be subsidized by the government. (3) To open two maritime schools to train sailors specifically to sail in the islands of the South Pacific. (4) The existing sailor training class on this route will also be expanded to double its size. All of the above plans are scheduled to be implemented by the Japanese government in conjunction with the Taiwan Governor-General's Office and the South Seas Agency successively in this fiscal year. The intention is to use Taiwan Island and the Japanese-mandated islands in the Pacific as bases and to extend the "New Order in East Asia" to the South Pacific. (19th dispatch from the Havas News Agency)

### Minister of Colonial Affairs Koiso Explains the Plan

Tokyo – At the meeting of the First Subcommittee of the House of Representatives Budget Committee on the 20th, the following questions and answers were exchanged regarding the Southern policy, cotton countermeasures, and others:

Shigeru Ishizaka (Current Affairs Comrades Association) asked, "What are the specific policies of the Minister of Colonial Affairs regarding the Southern policy?" Minister of Colonial Affairs Koiso replied, "We intend to base on Taiwan and the South Seas mandated territory and develop peaceful and economic strategies for South China, Thailand, the Straits Settlements, and the Dutch East Indies. Therefore, we first expect the establishment of a large investigation agency and the revitalization of economic agencies. Furthermore, we will strive to guide and cultivate the necessary human element to develop the South."

Fusa Miyoshi (Seiyukai Kuhara Faction) asked, "How will the Ministry of Colonial Affairs handle the cotton and wool countermeasures?" Minister of Colonial Affairs Koiso replied, "This is being guided by the Japan Cotton Cultivation Association and the East Asia Wool Association. We have previously established the North China Cotton Improvement Association and the Central China Cotton Improvement Association in North China and Central China, and we are planning to raise 2 million sheep in Mongolia and 1 million in Manchuria." The director of the Plantation Bureau replied, "The Japanese government is investigating the actual situation in various aspects and plans to secure 1 billion catties of cotton wool in the Japanese economic sphere."

Haruji Tahara (Social Mass Party) asked, "How about merging the current Ministry of Colonial Affairs, the Asia Development Board, and the Manchurian Affairs Bureau to establish a new East Asia Ministry in order to build a new order in East Asia?" The Minister of Colonial Affairs replied, "This is also a method, but it requires careful consideration for concretization. However, we are convinced that the Manchurian Affairs Bureau will be able to merge with the colonial administration in the near future. Also, the Asia Development Board may be reorganized after the end of the Incident." (20th dispatch from the Domei News Agency)

Tokyo – Minister of Colonial Affairs Koiso Kuniaki recently stated in the House of Representatives in response to a question from Park Chun-geum, the only Korean member of parliament, that Koreans may soon have the possibility of obtaining the right to vote. Japan should consider the issue of suffrage for its colonies. Although this opportunity is not yet ripe, election laws will be enacted in Korea sooner or later. When asked about Japan implementing compulsory basic education since 1872 and whether it will follow the same policy in Korea, the Minister of Colonial Affairs said that this was not a matter for the Ministry of Colonial Affairs, so he could not answer. However, he did not say that it would not be possible to implement compulsory education in Korea and Taiwan in the future. (20th dispatch from Reuters)

### Commentary from a German Newspaper on the Sino-Japanese Situation: Military and Diplomatic Deadlock, Japan Faces a Critical Juncture

Swiss Capital – A recent article published by the German "Stuttgarter Neues Tagblatt" commented on the war between China and Japan and the relations between Japan and the United States, stating: "Unless Japan decides to directly establish an understanding with General Chiang Kai-shek of China, it will be nearly impossible to resolve the China Incident. Although Japanese public opinion is weary of war, any solution that amounts to abandoning the 'New Order in East Asia' policy is difficult to accept. If Japan were to do so, it would be tantamount to defeat, and the bloodshed, injuries, and even loss of life of hundreds of thousands of people would be in vain, which the people of that country would not be happy to hear. As for the 'new government' to be organized by Wang Jingwei, it is merely a temporary measure, akin to the establishment of the Yonai cabinet as a transitional phenomenon. For the time being, it seems that Wang Jingwei and Yonai are not yet at the end of their roles, but sooner or later a new solution must be found. At that time, it will likely be the opportunity for a national revolutionary movement led by young Japanese. Moreover, the China Incident has had a significant impact on the relations between Japan and the United Kingdom and the United States. The United States, in practice, is virtually working for England. It is reported that the conditions proposed by the United States for renewing the US-Japan trade treaty not only require the unconditional withdrawal of Japanese troops from China but also the return of the four northeastern provinces to China. According to sources in Tokyo, the United States may even demand that Japan provide guarantees, specifically stating that it will not reach an understanding with the Soviet Union. If so, not only will Japan's prestige in the world be completely lost, but even its independence will be threatened. The Japanese government is well aware of this situation but still 'hopes' that American public opinion will change one day or 'hopes' for a miracle to reverse the situation. In summary, 1940 will be a critical juncture for Japan, and all decisions made by the country will have significant consequences." (Havas dispatch, 19th)

### Opening of the Yangtze River: Not Yet Certain, Statement by the Japanese Foreign and Army Ministers

Tokyo – Army Minister Shunroku Hata, in response to inquiries before the House of Representatives Budget Committee yesterday, stated that the date for the reopening of the Yangtze River would be determined after careful consideration of factors related to maintaining peace and order from a strategic point of view. Shunroku Hata denied reports that the local Japanese army and navy authorities had announced the opening of the Yangtze River on December 18th of last year, stating that the Yangtze would be reopened within three months. It is said that he intends to reopen the Yangtze to keep his promise, but the date must be decided by Japan based on local conditions. Foreign Minister Arita told the same committee that he wanted to firmly state that Japan was using the reopening of the Yangtze River as a bargaining chip with the United States. Unless there are foreseeable obstacles in the future, the Yangtze River will be reopened in accordance with the policy of the army and navy authorities, but the date cannot be specified. Arita denied newspaper reports that the Yangtze River would be opened within two months after the Japanese government's announcement. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)

### Japanese Bombing of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway: France Protests Again

Tokyo – French Ambassador to Japan, Henri, visited Vice Foreign Minister Kanya today. His mission seemed to be to protest to Japan regarding the bombing of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. (Associated Press dispatch, 20th)

Washington – Regarding the Japanese aircraft bombing of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, the US government has made representations to Japan. Secretary of State Hull said when meeting with reporters that the Japanese government has not yet responded. A reporter then asked what the State Department thought of the Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement that the country was waiting for the United States to make a compromise. Secretary of State Hull avoided a direct answer, saying only that the situation remained the same and there were no changes. (Havas dispatch, 19th)

### Japanese Army General Suzuki Passes Away

Tokyo – Suzuki Soroku, a Privy Councilor and General of the Army, had been resting at his residence in Ushigome, Tokyo, due to illness since the beginning of the year. He suddenly passed away due to heart failure at 1:30 PM on the 20th, at the age of seventy-six. General Suzuki was born in Niigata Prefecture, graduated from the first class of the Cavalry Department of the Military Academy, and served as a member of the General Staff Headquarters, instructor at the Army University, commander of the 3rd Cavalry Brigade, director of cavalry, commander of the Taiwan Army, commander of the Korean Army, Chief of the General Staff, and member of the Privy Council. He was promoted to General in the 13th year of the Taisho era, placed on the reserve list in the 5th year of the Showa era, and appointed Privy Councilor in the 7th year of the Showa era. During this time, he was also elected chairman of the Veterans Association. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 20th)

### Norwegian Foreign Minister Delivers Speech: Accuses British Warships of Violating Neutrality, Arguing that Warships Do Not Need to Be Inspected Under International Law, Altemark Case Should Be Submitted to Arbitration

Norwegian Capital – Foreign Minister Koht recently delivered a speech in the House of Representatives, explaining the circumstances of the "Altmark" case, stating: "British warships have greatly violated our country's neutrality. The 'Altmark' is a German 'public vessel' and, according to international law, should be regarded as a warship of that country. When the ship entered our territorial waters of the Trondheim Fjord on the 14th of this month, the commander of our torpedo boat requested an inspection, which the captain of the 'Altmark' agreed to. However, warships of all countries have no obligation to allow foreign inspections, so our commander only had the right to verify whether the ship was indeed the 'Altmark.' After the German captain presented various documents proving it to be so, he also informed our commander that the ship was equipped with anti-aircraft guns. Later, the commander of the Bergen Fortress, because he had not obtained sufficient information, sent another torpedo boat to a location one hundred miles north of the port on the second day and encountered the 'Altmark.' He immediately requested another inspection, but the captain of the ship refused. Since he had the right to do so, we could do nothing about it. Then, it was suddenly discovered that the ship was sending wireless signals within our territorial waters, and a protest was immediately lodged. Later, the German captain apologized. When the ship arrived in our Jøssingfjord, several British aircraft were seen flying nearby. It could not be determined whether these aircraft had intruded into our airspace. There is no doubt that the British Navy knew very well what the 'Altmark' had done in the past. Later, British warships entered our territorial waters, our authorities protested, and clashes occurred between British and German sailors. These details have been described in the government's public statement and do not need to be repeated. What can be said now is that the British government's handling of this case seems to assume that it has the right to disregard international law and that small countries seeking to maintain neutrality need not be taken into account. Although our country does not have sufficient military strength, we can still protest, even appeal to the League of Nations, and make the truth known to the world. In essence, we can appeal to public opinion. The arguments put forward by the British authorities are that the British destroyer 'Cossack' had the right to rescue British prisoners. However, according to international law, there is no provision prohibiting warships of belligerent countries from transporting enemy prisoners through the territorial waters of neutral countries, as long as the procedures are legal." After the Foreign Minister finished speaking, Conservative Party leader Hambro rose to speak, stating that the government's protest to the United Kingdom was supported by the entire nation. (Havas dispatch, 19th)

Norwegian Capital – The House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee held a meeting this afternoon, attended by cabinet members and many international law experts, likely to discuss the "Altmark" case. (Havas dispatch, 19th)

### Norway Asks England to Return British Prisoners, Rejected by the British Government

London – Officials recently stated that the British and Norwegian governments are closely studying the situation arising from the "Altmark" case. Notes are being reviewed by both sides. As for Norway's request for the return of British prisoners, it has been immediately rejected by the United Kingdom. (Havas dispatch, 19th)

### Altmark Case: German Investigation Nears Completion, "Important Decision" To Be Announced Soon, More Political than Military

Danish Capital – The "Berliner Tageblatt" recently published a dispatch from its correspondent in Germany, stating that the German authorities' investigation into the "Altmark" case is nearing completion and that an "important decision" will be announced soon, which is said to be more political than military in nature. (Havas dispatch, 19th)

Berlin – A spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry stated yesterday that the question of why two Norwegian warships allowed a British destroyer to pass them and attack the German ship "Altmark" is still being clarified. It is not yet known whether the German government will ask the Norwegian government to explain. However, the British destroyer's attempt to capture the German ship was very obvious, as the Norwegian captain had informed the captain of the "Altmark." Therefore, Norway had an obligation to protect its neutrality when it was harmed by the United Kingdom. The Norwegian warship's inaction seemed to indicate an abandonment of the obligation to protect neutrality. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 20th)

Berlin – The German "Völkischer Beobachter" commented on the "Altmark" incident, listing three key points: (1) The British government ordered the massacre of the crew of the "Altmark." (2) The British government rewarded the soldiers who massacred the German crew. (3) The British government ordered the navy to violate Norwegian neutrality. The "Berliner Börsen-Zeitung" also appealed to neutral countries, stating that the "Cossack" incident showed that Britain hoped neutral countries would be absolutely obedient. The maintenance of neutrality requires not only verbal declarations but also appropriate actions. (Haitong dispatch, 20th)

### Germany Does Not Intend to Cause Disputes with Norway, Expanding the War Scope Would Only Benefit England and France

Stockholm – Although the "Altmark" incident is still being widely discussed in Berlin, there are no signs of direct disputes between Germany and Norway. The German press is now continuing to attack the United Kingdom while trying to avoid criticizing Norway. A German spokesman does not deny that the "Altmark" was an escort ship for the pocket battleship "Admiral Spee" and that it entered Norwegian territorial waters with British prisoners on board, flying the German flag, stating that this was an absolutely fair and permissible action. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)

The Hague – According to observers from neutral countries in Berlin, Germany may not take any serious action against Norway and Sweden at this time. Its threats are only aimed at trying to obtain various benefits without using force. The Germans know that if the current scope of the war were to expand to the Scandinavian Peninsula, it would only benefit England and France. Therefore, the country believes that the "Altmark" case is a provocative act by the United Kingdom, intended to induce Germany to expand the scope of the war. The German authorities have already seen through this strategy and will not fall into its trap. The German view is that the country has no real ability to resist the "Altmark" case. Although it is threatening to step up submarine warfare, it is just empty talk. As of the end of the month, the country's submarines only know how to attack ships of neutral countries. In short, after the "Altmark" case occurred, the German authorities felt quite棘手, but only knew how to take the opportunity to intimidate neutral countries. This situation is enough to prove that it is unable to break through the blockade of the Central Powers. (Havas dispatch, 19th)

### Norwegian Newspaper Details the Truth of the Incident

Norwegian Capital – Newspapers here published a special dispatch from Narvik, detailing the "Altmark" incident. It is reported that the German ship is still aground in the bay, protected by two Norwegian warships at the entrance to the Ofotfjord. The ice in the bay is two inches thick, as no ships have sailed there in the past two weeks. However, the "Altmark" had no difficulty breaking through the ice. The ship was anchored inside the Ofotfjord, and the British destroyer followed the route cleared by the German ship into the bay. Residents of Narvik Harstad could see the "Altmark" being attacked and British sailors boarding the ship in the bright light of searchlights. The German crew could not resist and jumped off the ship. The "Altmark" launched a lifeboat, which also capsized. German crew members swam to the shore amidst the hail of bullets from the British ship or fled across the ice to nearby houses for shelter. Injured crew members were rescued by Norwegian fishermen. (Haitong dispatch, 20th)

### Swedish Newspaper Advocates Nordic Monroe Doctrine to Avoid Being Drawn into the Whirlpool of War, Three Foreign Ministers to Meet

Swedish Capital – The "Dagens Nyheter" today commented on the "Altmark" incident, believing that if the Nordic countries adopted a Nordic Monroe Doctrine, this unfortunate incident would not have occurred. Judging from this incident, the major powers clearly want to extend the flames of war to the neutral small countries. At the same time, it shows us that the only way to prevent the war from extending to us is to firmly grasp all our power. The Nordic region is currently in the midst of a struggle between the two sides, and its future is being tested. At this time, what our neutral countries should pay attention to is to adopt a firm attitude, reiterate that we do not want to interfere in other people's affairs, and hope that others will not involve us in their whirlpool. If we want to protect our national destiny, we can only adopt an attitude that can be respected. (Associated Press dispatch, 20th)

Paris – The foreign ministers of the Scandinavian countries are scheduled to hold a meeting in the capital of Denmark on the 24th. Only the foreign ministers of Norway, Sweden, and Denmark will attend, and the Finnish government will not be represented. Political figures here attach great importance to this meeting, saying that since the last meeting of these countries in the capital of Sweden, the Finnish-Soviet war has become increasingly close. Norway and Sweden must carefully plan ways to deal with it. Although the governments and people of both countries unanimously desire peace, there is a clear difference between the policies pursued by the government and the views of the people. The authorities in these countries have always believed that their only crisis lies in the Soviet Union and that Germany's desire to maintain its outpost in the Baltic Sea and prevent the Soviet Union from extending its influence to the Atlantic Ocean can serve as a shield for the security of these countries. However, the alliance between Germany and the Soviet Union has overturned this traditional guarantee, and the position of these countries is in danger. However, the authorities still want to rely on Germany to resist the Soviet Union, and they are willing to be manipulated by Germany, thereby affecting their neutral status. This is not a blessing for these countries. The recent refusal of the Swedish government to provide military assistance to Finland was clearly due to German threats, and the Norwegian authorities' permission for Germany to import various goods through its territorial waters and for the German ship "Altmark" to illegally use its territorial waters are even clearer evidence of the country's support for Germany. On the other hand, this attitude of Sweden and Norway is due to their fear of Germany. However, the great victory of the Finnish army yesterday shows that the country has obtained substantial assistance from the United Kingdom and France. At the same time, the United Kingdom has also resolved not to allow incidents similar to the "Altmark" case to happen again. This situation may have a decisive impact on the current policies of Sweden and Norway. (Havas dispatch, 19th)

### Norway Clearly Adopts Passive Neutrality, Submits to German Pressure, Observations from Paris

Paris – People here unanimously approve of the spirit and form of the British protest to Norway over the "Altmark" incident. According to informed observers, Norway, like Sweden, seems to adopt an attitude of "passive neutrality." However, neutrality contains responsibility, while passivity is not neutrality. Norway's attitude towards the "Altmark" case is similar to Sweden's refusal to grant military assistance to Finland. What is called passivity is in practice no different from submitting to the pressure exerted by Germany without resistance. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)

### Funeral Held for Deceased German Crew Members, Hitler Sends Wreaths

Oslo – Six crew members of the German ship "Altmark" who died resisting British sailors in Jøssingfjord were buried yesterday in the nearby village of Sokndal. The German ambassador to Norway and other German officials and many crew members of the "Altmark" stood at attention to pay their respects as the coffins were taken ashore. Some troops from a Norwegian warship lined up on the shore. A total of more than seventy vehicles followed the coffins to Sokndal. The funeral was presided over by a pastor from the German church in Oslo. The German ambassador, the captain of the "Altmark," and a captain from the Norwegian navy each gave a brief eulogy. A Norwegian captain also placed a wreath on the grave. Hitler and the German Navy each sent wreaths. The captain of the "Altmark" today denied that the British prisoners on board had been mistreated, saying that many of the British prisoners thanked him for the good treatment when they left the ship. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)

### Norwegian Newspaper Proposes Arbitration, President of the United States to Serve as Chairman, Hull Says Still Under Study

Norwegian Capital – The Norwegian newspaper Dagbladet yesterday asked the government to suggest that President Roosevelt be the chairman of the arbitration court for the "Altmark" case. The court will have neutral experts determine the rights of the "Altmark." The Norwegian newspaper said, "If British Foreign Secretary Halifax believes that the United Kingdom is justified in this case, he cannot oppose the convening of an arbitration court. The same goes for German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop." Refusing to participate in the arbitration court is an admission of error. They predicted that President Roosevelt would accept this proposal. (Associated Press dispatch, 20th)

Washington – Government officials yesterday adopted an extremely cautious attitude in criticizing the Norwegian suggestion that President Roosevelt be the chairman of the arbitration court for the "Altmark" case to determine which country was at fault. Secretary of State Hull declared that he had never heard of this proposal. This proposal is full of international disputes and must be carefully studied before a decision is made. (Associated Press dispatch, 20th)

### Finnish Spokesman in London Continues to Appeal for Foreign Aid, England and France Will Intensify Military Assistance, US Willing to Continue Granting Finland Credit Loans, Swedish King Admired the Finnish People's Struggle

London – The Finnish spokesman in London again issued an appeal last night for manpower and military equipment to aid Finland. The spokesman acknowledged that the Soviet invasion of Finland was deeper than before, but said that although the situation was serious, the key to determining victory or defeat had not yet been reached. Two points of the Finnish first defense line had been breached, but it was too early to say that this success of the Soviet army had any impact. In addition to natural barriers, the Finnish positions still have other defenses, which are still intact. The overall situation is by no means extremely dangerous. If countries want to save Finland, it is time to turn their words of sympathy and friendship into action. What Finland needs is manpower, aircraft, artillery, and military supplies to make up for the shortages on the front lines. No British volunteers have yet set off for Finland, but two ambulance teams are on their way. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)

Swedish Capital – According to "Aftonbladet," Lieutenant Colonel Garnival, representing General Gamelin, the commander-in-chief of the Anglo-French forces, arrived in Helsinki yesterday as a guest of Finnish General Commander Mannerheim. According to the newspaper, Garnier's mission is to examine the Finnish war situation in order to determine the issue of Allied assistance to Finland. (Haitong dispatch, 20th)

Brussels – According to a "Belgian News Agency" correspondent in London, the Allies will intensify their military assistance to Finland due to the tense situation in Finland, and will give priority to transporting artillery and volunteers. Anglo-French aircraft will no longer be transported by ship, but will fly directly to Finland. (Haitong dispatch, 20th)

Washington – Federal Loan Administrator Jones told the House Banking Committee yesterday that if the Soviet Union declares war on Finland or President Roosevelt determines that a state of war exists between the Soviet Union and Finland, the Neutrality Act would prohibit the Export-Import Bank from lending to Finland. The United States is now willing to continue granting Finland credit loans while Finland still has a chance to fight and win. The Senate last week approved a bill to increase the Export-Import Bank's lending capacity by 100 million yuan so that the bank could continue to grant loans to Finland and China. Although the bill did not specifically name countries, the proposers of the bill have clarified that they hope the Export-Import Bank will provide loans to Finland and China, but these loans are not to be used to purchase military equipment, arms, and war materials. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)

New York – The Aid Finland Committee, led by former US President Hoover, previously only raised relief funds for Finnish civilians, but has now expanded its scope of activities to raise military supplies for the Finnish army. Hoover explained the action by saying that 120,000 Americans have already donated 1.9 million yuan, of which 1.2 million yuan has already been sent to Finland. (Haitong dispatch, 20th)

Swedish Capital – Swedish King Gustav recently issued a statement approving of the Swedish government's refusal to provide military assistance to Finland, saying that the struggle of the Finnish compatriots is admirable. The Swedish people have striven to help them in various ways, but Finland cannot expect military assistance. This has been clear from the beginning of the war. With great sorrow, after reviewing this issue, I have decided that we must maintain this attitude. Otherwise, Sweden will be in great danger of being at war not only with the Soviet Union but also with other major powers. If this were to happen, Sweden would not be able to continue providing the assistance it is currently giving to Finland. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)

Rome – An observer newspaper yesterday predicted that Finland would ultimately be defeated due to the large number of Soviet troops. The newspaper published a commentary on the Soviet-Finnish war on the cover commentary page. The newspaper praised the bravery of the Finnish army but predicted that the Finnish army would be defeated and that neutral countries would not dare to assist Finland for fear of Soviet reprisals.

### Soviet Troops Advance Again; Finland Claims New Positions; Northeast Line of Lake Ladoga; Finland Claims Destruction of Soviet Division

Helsinki, Today, three air raid alarms were issued here, but no Soviet aircraft appeared. On the Karelian front, the Red Army launched another offensive against new Finnish positions yesterday. In addition, between Lake Vuoksi and the Gulf of Finland, the Red Army's offensive has slightly weakened and is currently focusing its efforts on attacking along the Taipale River. (Havas News Agency dispatch on the 20th)

Stockholm, According to reliable sources in Helsinki, General Mannerheim's forces are currently inflicting heavy blows on Soviet troops on the Lake Ladoga front. Communication between a Soviet division northeast of Lake Ladoga and its base has been severed. (Reuters dispatch on the 20th)

Moscow, According to a communiqué from the Leningrad Military District Headquarters, the Soviet offensive in the Karelian region on the 19th progressed very smoothly. Soviet troops continued to clear out the enemy in the "Jokikylä" fortified area and occupied Riensalmi (one kilometer from Jännisjärvi), Riihisaari Island (five kilometers southwest of Jännisjärvi), and the Ratimäki-Humaljoki East Station on the coastal railway. In other areas, there were no major developments. The Soviet Air Force bombed enemy troops and military targets, and shot down 14 enemy aircraft in aerial combat. (TASS dispatch on the 20th)

Helsinki, A Finnish communiqué recently stated that the Soviet 18th Division, which was trapped on the northeast front of Lake Ladoga several weeks ago and cut off from the main Soviet forces, has now been completely destroyed. A total of 18,000 Soviet soldiers were killed or captured. Finland was subjected to a large-scale air raid on Sunday. It is believed that the number of Soviet aircraft over Finland reached a record high that day. Finland claims to have shot down at least ten Soviet aircraft. Neutral newspaper reporters reviewing the war situation in Karelia stated that the Finnish forces in that area, which had been under great pressure, are now getting the much-needed rest due to the cessation of the Soviet offensive. The Soviet advance towards Vyborg, that is, the Finnish right flank, has been forced to retreat, but the Soviet left flank's offensive northeast of Lake Ladoga has not been victorious; otherwise, the Finnish strategic position would be extremely dangerous. The Soviet 54th Division and the Siberian Ski Battalion, which attempted to salvage the declining situation in that area, suffered extremely heavy losses and cannot coordinate with other parts of the front line. Therefore, the Soviet movements behind this "waist" are not to be feared. The Finnish weakness now lies in the defensive line on the right flank of Vyborg. The Soviet troops must carry out many preliminary works before starting the second phase of the offensive, and in the first phase of the offensive, they will inevitably be repeatedly hindered by the Finnish Air Force, which is now stronger than at the start of the war. According to a Finnish communiqué, the Soviet offensive between the Gulf of Finland and Vuoksi has been defeated by the Finnish forces. Finnish troops seized twenty cannons southeast of Sämenkiitä and twenty tanks, thirty-six heavy guns, and seventeen large trucks northeast of Lake Ladoga. Soviet troops are currently attacking in the Taipale area and are engaged in combat. On Sunday, the Finnish Air Force conducted reconnaissance and bombing flights in the Soviet rear. As a result of repeated air battles, Finnish aircraft were victorious. Soviet aircraft were very active in the war zone and inland, dropping bombs on many cities and towns, destroying civilian homes and killing and injuring many civilians. It has now been confirmed that a total of twenty Soviet aircraft were shot down, and four others have landed. Soviet aircraft used machine guns to strafe civilians during the air raids. (Reuters dispatch on the 20th)

Helsinki, Eight air raid alarms were issued in the port of Åbo yesterday. Although Soviet aircraft groups bombed, the damage was minimal. (Havas dispatch on the 20th)

### German Submarine Activity; Ship Sinking Statistics in Various Countries; 26 Ships Sunk in the Last Ten Days, Totaling Over 100,400 Tons

London, Officials recently announced that from the 12th to midnight on the 18th of this month, the enemy sank a total of five British ships, totaling 39,276 tons, and fifteen neutral ships, totaling 46,801 tons. The three British ships sunk by the enemy today, totaling 7,562 tons, and the three neutral ships, totaling 6,830 tons, are not yet included. Since the outbreak of the war, British, French, and neutral ships sunk by Germany total 1,059,766 tons. This figure is less than in the last European war. In 1917, in the month of April alone, Allied and neutral ships sunk totaled 869,000 tons. In addition, from the beginning of the war to the 14th of this month, a total of 8,969 British, French, and neutral ships were escorted by British warships, of which only nineteen were sunk. In other words, one ship was sunk out of every 472 ships. The effectiveness of the escort measures can be seen from this. (Havas dispatch on the 20th)

London, Two neutral ships were lost off the coast of Spain yesterday, with more than twenty-two lives lost. One was the Spanish ship "Pinduras" (2,000 tons), which sank after an explosion six miles off Cape Villano. The other was the Greek ship "Elly" (1,000 tons), carrying coal from Cardiff to Greece, which was hit by a German submarine torpedo sixty miles off Cape Finisterre. Twenty-two of the twenty-nine crew members of the "Pinduras" were lost, while the "Elly" was luckier, with all twenty-six crew members escaping in lifeboats and being rescued by a fishing boat, but they have all been sent to the hospital for treatment. It is reported that after the crew left the ship, the German submarine fired a second torpedo, completely destroying the "Elly." In addition, the Norwegian shipping company of the Norwegian ship "Yika" (1,503 tons) today received a message relayed by the Norwegian Foreign Ministry stating that the ship was hit by a torpedo on [date omitted] 29th without warning.

### Japanese Economy on the Brink of Exhaustion; U.S. Pressure Could Cause Collapse Within a Year

Washington, According to reliable sources today, the U.S. State Department received a report from Tokyo stating that the result of Japan's war in China will bring its economy to the brink of exhaustion. Due to poor harvests in Korea, food supplies have been sharply reduced, coupled with a shortage of coal and oil, forcing Japanese factories to close. If the United States stops supplying raw materials such as oil, pig iron, and cotton, Japan will collapse within a year. Such action by the United States will pressure Japan to abandon its plan to develop Manchurian industries. Due to Japan's repeated exports of gold, the gold reserves of the Bank of Japan have been reduced to $95 million. In 1939, Japan sold gold to the United States worth a total of $166 million, but the total gold production of Japan and Manchuria in 1939 was only $30 million. Therefore, Japan has to take further action using its dwindling gold reserves to make up for the difference. Japan anticipates the possibility of the United States imposing an embargo, so in mid-January of this year, it exported 380 million yen in gold to the United States, immediately exchanging it for U.S. dollars in order to purchase raw materials such as oil, pig iron, copper, and cotton to increase its domestic reserves. However, according to officials in the State Department, the various raw materials purchased by Japan in the last quarter of 1939 indicate that Japan's economic capacity can only support itself for at most one more year after the United States imposes an embargo.

### Japan Drives All Able-Bodied Men to the Battlefield; Severe Shortage of Labor in the Country; Forces Young Men and Women to Engage in Wartime Industries; Numerous Cases of Merchants Violating Control Regulations

Tokyo, Due to the shortage of labor in Japan, the government has decided to implement a new regulation next month to remedy the situation, requiring all young male workers in the country to work for wartime industries. The general regulations stipulate that factories manufacturing non-essential goods should reduce their workforce by 30%, and are not allowed to hire male workers aged 12 to 30 before the reduction. At the same time, factories and shops not engaged in wartime industries should gradually reduce the number of male employees they hire, but university graduates are not included. Conversely, the 116 types of wartime industries designated by law are free to hire male workers over the age of 12. This new regulation also applies to female workers aged 12 to [age omitted]. As a result, theaters, restaurants, wine shops, cafes, tea rooms, billiard rooms, and other similar places throughout the country will suffer a major blow, and even geishas will be affected, because geisha houses will no longer be allowed to hire young girls aged thirteen or fourteen for training. (Havas dispatch on the 19th)

Tokyo, According to official reports, in the past seven months, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department alone has discovered more than 200,000 cases of violating government regulations on price controls, rent, wages, and the use and sale of materials and goods. However, only 2,129 cases resulted in penalties or punishment, and the rest were only reprimanded. Illegal transactions last year increased sevenfold compared to the total in 1938. On September 18 last year, the government issued an order stipulating controlled prices, and in August 1938, it issued various control regulations, limiting the prices and transactions of goods such as leather, rubber, cotton, woolen goods, copper, iron, gasoline, and wood. In the last five months of 1938, only 18,000 cases of violations were uncovered, but in the same period last year, the number reached 148,000. In October alone, there were 68,900 cases of violating price regulations, nearly two and a half times the number in the last five months of 1938. In addition to prices, the most frequent violations were illegal trading, with fuel being the most common, followed by the secret trading of iron and non-ferrous metals.

### Ministry of Education Promotes Vocational Supplementary Education; Recruits Students from War Zones to Train Various Skills

(Chongqing Airmail) The Ministry of Education's promotion of vocational supplementary education over the past two and a half years is as follows: (1) In 1937 and 1938, the Central, Dagong, China, and Chongqing Industrial Vocational Schools were designated to run mechanical, civil engineering, telecommunications, and automobile driving training classes for a period of one year. Funding was allocated by the Ministry, and approximately 170 students were recruited from war zones. The graduates have excellent career prospects, with monthly salaries ranging from 50-60 yuan to over 100 yuan. (2) In the 1939 academic year, various industrial vocational schools, as well as the Nanchong Sericulture Vocational School, the Central Midwifery School, the Jiangsu Medical College National Pharmaceutical School, were designated, and in cooperation with the Ministry of Health, 35 training classes were run, recruiting 1,450 students from war zones. Further efforts are planned to continue running these classes. (3) Recently, discussions have been held with the Ministry of Economic Affairs and other relevant agencies to conduct vocational supplementary education in public and private factories and farms, with the intention of promoting it widely. (4) Recently, given the large number of factories of all sizes and various skilled workers near a certain location, certain vocational schools are planning to conduct vocational supplementary education for the workers nearby.

### Sichuan Education Department Discusses with Bookstores to Reduce Textbook Prices

Measures Have Been Decided

(Chengdu Airmail) Regarding the textbook issue, in August of last year, the Sichuan Education Department, following an order from the Ministry, instructed schools to mimeograph lecture notes for distribution and application, and to subsidize impoverished students for the price increase portion. Subsequently, due to the excessive cost of mimeographing and the tight office expenses of schools, there were no funds for subsidies. Therefore, the Chief Secretary of the Education Department and the heads of various departments negotiated with the managers of major bookstores in Chengdu, resulting in a discounted sale for one month (10% off for middle schools, 15% off for primary schools). The Education Department also submitted a request to the Ministry, which was forwarded to the Ministry of Finance, to reduce remittance rates to alleviate textbook prices, but this was not approved by the Ministry of Finance. In December of last year, another method was devised. In addition to submitting a request to the Ministry to allow major bookstores to reprint textbooks with their own machines, letters were also sent to bookstores in Sichuan, requesting them to reduce prices while also requesting the General Bureau to allow printing in Sichuan Province. Subsequently, an order was received from the Ministry instructing them to comply with the previous order, and reprinting was not approved. The bookstores also found it difficult to reduce prices due to the high cost of transportation and remittances, and the high cost of materials. It was necessary for the General Bureau to coordinate and handle the matter. On the 31st of last month, the Education Department convened a meeting of middle school principals to discuss the issue of reducing textbook prices. On the day before yesterday, the managers of major bookstores in the provincial capital were convened to discuss this issue, and the following solutions were decided: (A) Fundamental Solution: Raise tens of thousands of yuan of government and commercial capital (the Education and Construction Departments and various bookstores must subscribe to shares), adopt a government-supervised commercial method to establish a factory locally to manufacture printing machinery, paper, and printed books, and first organize a preparatory committee to hire experts to begin planning everything. (B) Temporary Solution: In addition to the Zhengzhong Bookstore and Kaiming Bookstore reprinting textbooks in Sichuan using local paper and selling them at a 5% increase as a discount, the textbooks of the Commercial Press, China Bookstore, and World Bookstore originally had a 23.5% increase in price to account for costs, transportation, remittances, etc. Now, in the spirit of serving culture, each bookstore will select two types of textbooks each for senior high school, junior high school, and one type of Chinese textbook for junior primary school, and one type each of Chinese and arithmetic textbooks for senior primary school, and sell them at a 70% reduction from the original increase in price (i.e., 13.5% of the list price). The bookstores will first submit the names and quantities of textbooks they have in stock to the Education Department for designation. In the future, students purchasing designated discounted books from various schools must have a certificate from the school principal to enjoy the discount. It is reported that the responsible persons of the Commercial Press, China Bookstore, and World Bookstore have formally expressed their support for this method to the Education Department.

### Ministry of Education Commends the First Drama Troupe

(Chongqing Airmail) The First Touring Drama Education Troupe performed military morale boosting performances in Changsha last month with the plays "The First Volunteer" and "Beacon Fire," and then went to Gaotao Shangjie in northern Hunan for three days of performances, and three performances in Jinjing Nanyangmiao. At the same time, they went to Shitang, ten miles away, to perform four performances for the XX Division, and also went to Zhengjiaxia to perform two performances for the XX Division. At the same time, while staying in Changsha, they held a series of drama lectures for the Jingzhong Service Corps, covering "Basics of Performance," "Stage Management," Drama "Criticism," "Makeup Methods," and Theater Group "Organization," five topics in total, and directed the play "Human Traffickers." They lectured for the Anti-Enemy Work Corps of Yuying Children on "Confucius and Mencius" and "Recent International Overview," rehearsed the plays "Children Under Fire," "The Last Lesson," and "Go to the Guerrilla," and provided singing guidance to Nancheng Elementary School, among other guidance work. Other propaganda work was also actively participated in, such as popular lectures, covering "The Victory in Northern Hunan and the Situation Ahead," "Recent Developments in the Soviet Union and the United States," "China and Japan," and "The Military Situation in the Two Years Since the Start of the War," four topics in total. The entire troupe also went to the wounded soldiers' hospital to comfort the wounded soldiers, singing for them and delivering a message of consolation on behalf of the citizens of Changsha. They also held a symposium for elementary school teachers at the Gaotao Fourth People's Education Center, lecturing on "The International Situation and Our Country's War of Resistance" and "Wartime Singing Teaching Issues." After receiving the report, the Ministry of Education, noting that the troupe rushed to the front after the victory of the National Army in northern Hunan, making timely and on-the-spot performances to comfort the military and civilians, and to promote the War of Resistance, commended the troupe leader and the accompanying members for their tireless efforts and dedication to their work, and ordered that a list of the personnel participating in this work be reported to the Ministry for performance evaluation.

### Applying for Studying in the U.S. Must Be Done Early

The Global Student Association Declares

The American academic system recruits students in two semesters each year, one in spring and one in fall. The spring semester starts in early February, so students going to the U.S. mostly sail in January. The fall semester starts in mid-September, so students going to the U.S. mostly depart in August. According to the Global Chinese Student Association, the procedures to be completed before going to the U.S. to study include requesting an admission certificate from an American university, a study abroad certificate from the Ministry of Education, a passport from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and booking a ship berth. These must be prepared early, and the certificate from the American university must be obtained before proceeding with the passport application and other procedures. Because it takes time to process this certificate, it is especially necessary to start requesting it three or four months before sailing. Therefore, students who aspire to study in the U.S. are encouraged to complete the procedures as soon as possible. It is said that inquiries can be made by writing to or visiting the Association for a satisfactory answer.

### Rice Merchants Exceeding Price Limits; Police Requesting Strict Punishment to Deter Others; Rice Market Committee Members Receive Warning Letters

Qu Baizhen, manager of Fongsheng Rice Store at 467 Fujian Road, and Du Hongshou, a rice broker, were arrested and detained for fifteen days each by the police after violating the Public Works Department's order by exceeding the price limit when selling粳米 at the Shanghai Special District Court. Recently, one Ren Yuanlai went to Shenyuan Rice Store at 81 North Haikou Road to purchase five斗 of white rice. The store demanded 51 yuan. Ren paid 25.5 yuan and obtained a receipt. Ren reported the matter to the Zhabei Police Station, which sent detectives who arrested Chen Weiqin (61 years old, from Jiading), the manager of the store. An examination of the store's books revealed that from the 17th to the 19th, the rice store had conducted seventeen transactions, with rice prices ranging from 51 yuan to 54 yuan, all exceeding the price limit by more than 10 yuan. He was sent to the Ninth Court of the Shanghai Special District Court yesterday morning. The police lawyer, Li Zhishan, presented the case, prosecuting him under Article 33 of the Public Security Punishment Regulations, requesting the court to impose the maximum penalty according to the law. After Ren Yuanlai reported the case, Chen Weiqin was questioned. Chen denied being the manager of the rice store, claiming to have come to Shanghai from his hometown to escape the disaster and was simply staying at the store. Judge Huang reviewed the confession and sentenced Chen Weiqin to fifteen days of detention as a warning. It is reported that yesterday, Gongmi (tribute rice) fell by three yuan. The fair price policy will be implemented from the 23rd, and the details will be announced immediately.

Notification for Group Purchases by Various Industries

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce issued a notice to various industry guilds, stating that it had received a letter from the Municipal Food Adjustment Association. Considering that various industries and groups have not been very enthusiastic about entrusting the association to purchase rice on their behalf, the association has compiled and printed a document for wide distribution, requesting the Chamber to forward it to various trade associations for promotion. The Chamber believes that ordering foreign rice is the only way to stabilize rice prices at present. If various guilds and major companies can widely promote and join group purchases, the panic over food shortages in the city can be alleviated, and the livelihood concerns of employees can also be partially resolved. This will also benefit business stability. Benefiting others is benefiting oneself. Therefore, the Chamber is sending the aforementioned printed materials together with the letter and hopes that it will be handled accordingly.

Warning to the Rice Industry to Voluntarily Reduce Prices

The Bean, Rice, and Tea Exchange issued Public Notice No. 120 yesterday, stating that according to reports from various committee members, recent letters from enthusiastic individuals have stated that rice prices have exceeded the limit and continue to rise sharply. The livelihood of over three million ordinary citizens in the city is in a serious and desperate situation, and social order is about to become unmanageable. According to accurate investigations, the amount of rice stored in Shanghai is quite large, and the supply of rice from various places is also very abundant, with no shortage at all. At the same time, it is well known that all rice merchants, large and small, are making huge profits. This clearly shows that rice merchants only care about their own personal interests and are deliberately raising rice prices. As one of the responsible persons in the rice market, you are engaging in hoarding and speculation, allowing manipulation, disrupting social order, and harming people's livelihoods. Your intentions are reprehensible and unforgivable. We hereby issue a solemn warning, hoping that you will quickly realize your errors and voluntarily lower rice prices immediately, and warn your rice industry colleagues not to exceed the previously set price limit. If you continue to ignore our sincere advice, and act senselessly and recklessly, we will take strict measures to deal with you. Do not say that we did not warn you in advance. The enthusiastic individuals are acting out of zeal and a sense of justice, and are speaking on behalf of the city's citizens. The various committees of the rice market have held meetings and expressed their deep sympathy and have already taken this into account. For example, the rice market has strictly enforced the rules for buying and selling, buying and selling in order, and trading based on actual demand every day to prevent speculative hoarding. Repeated public notices have been issued, hoping that colleagues in the industry will strictly abide by these rules and not engage in illegal transactions. This is also the basis for stabilizing rice prices. The colleagues in our rice market are only buying and selling on behalf of customers and have no inventory. Therefore, the daily market price on the market is based on the sellers' willingness to sell. However, in every transaction, we have been diligently persuading sellers to lower prices to achieve the committee's initial intention of stabilizing prices. We will continue to work hard in the future to implement the various rules previously established by the rice market separately. If there are those who engage in hoarding, we will investigate and punish them without leniency and advise cargo owners and merchants to sell at fair prices in order to lower market prices. If there are any violations, we will report the firms, merchants, and warehouse receipts that are raising market prices and transacting at high prices to society for adjudication. This is hereby recorded and announced. It is hoped that everyone will abide by this. This announcement is made.

### Salvation Army Donations Must Clarify the Truth

Funds for the First Refugee Shelter are Provided by the Relief Association

The First Refugee Shelter, which is run by the Refugee Relief Association and located on Dunxin Road, has been managed by the Salvation Army's Ma Ruishan and Du Baotian since July 1 last year. The food and expenses are still provided by the association as usual, and all major affairs are also managed by the association. Recently, the Salvation Army claimed that there were over 70,000 refugees and included the Dunxin Road shelter among them, distributing printed materials and soliciting donations from the outside world. This led to inquiries from the association's donors. Yesterday afternoon at 2 o'clock, the association's chairman, Yu Qiaqing, and others convened a meeting with the Salvation Army's Ma Ruishan and Du Baotian to discuss how to make a public statement so that donors could understand the truth. As a result, it was agreed that the Salvation Army should make a statement itself. Otherwise, the association would announce the truth and asked the Salvation Army to reply by the afternoon of the next day for further action.

### Implementation of Fair-Priced Coal Briquettes; Coal Briquette Stores Still Hoarding and Refusing to Sell; Coal Industry Hoarding a Large Amount of Raw Materials; Fair-Price Sales as a Solution Need Improvement

After the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Machine-Made Coal Briquette Industry Association announced four measures to implement fair-priced coal briquettes at 110 yuan per ton and 5.8 yuan per dan, it was implemented yesterday morning. Arbitrary price increases are strictly prohibited. As for the holders of coal briquette warehouse receipts, they are required to pay the warehouse rent and deliver the briquettes within ten days from today. Failure to do so will result in the suspension of delivery and the recovery of the receipts. Citizens who wish to purchase fair-priced coal briquettes can purchase them from the members of the industry association: Yitai, Nanyang, Guohua, Dongfang, Jinghua, Yuedong, Beiyang, Hulicheng, Nanhua, Xinpinganji, Huacheng, Gongping, Yanyan, Heji, Gongyong, Wufu, Nanfang, and Huachengcui Ji, a total of eighteen factories. The hours are from 7:00 AM to 7:00 PM. During the fair-price sales period, deliveries are temporarily suspended. It has also been found that a large coal company on Jiangxi Road, the Pudong Xigu Warehouse, has 5,000 to 6,000 tons of coal briquette raw material Gubaxie (coal dust) in stock, and a large coal store in the Wuzhou Building, the Peidong Warehouse, has thousands of tons of coal briquette raw materials in stock, but they are not selling them, intentionally hoarding and speculating. It is reported that Mr. Yu Qiaqing has been asked to sell them at a low price.

Fair Sales Method Needs Improvement

After the Coal Briquette Industry Association agreed on a fair sales method, its eighteen member companies began selling at the same time yesterday. However, most citizens do not know the addresses of the coal briquette factories and do not know where to buy them. They went to the nearby coal stores to buy, but the manufacturers had not sent any coal there. Due to the purchase price, the coal stores refused to sell at the fair price, resulting in arguments and disputes. The fair-price selling factories also claimed that the method was not good and said that the goods were sold out or that they needed to hand in the warehouse receipts and did not provide enough coal briquettes. Therefore, although each factory produces more than 1,000 tons per day, yesterday's fair-price sales accounted for less than one-tenth due to the above reasons. Therefore, people from all walks of life hope that the relevant authorities will improve the method and make the fair-price sales a reality.

Boiled Water Industry Allowed to Obtain Permits to Purchase Coal

The Shanghai Coal Industry Association held a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees at the Shishi Restaurant on Tianjin Road at 2:00 PM yesterday. The chairman, Wei Zhida, first reported the purpose of the meeting. Then, the following resolutions were made: (1) Investigate coal stocks and market prices. The resolution was passed. (2) The Municipal Chamber of Commerce requested that the industry association notify the industry to unify the market price of coal briquettes. The resolution was to notify members and write to the Coal Briquette Industry Association to inform its members to provide as much coal as possible, and to reply to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. (3) The boiled water industry association requested information on fair-priced coal purchases and its method. The resolution was to notify the industry immediately. The notification stated, "The application forms previously issued by this association can be used to obtain permits to purchase coal in person at the association from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM every day from February 24th to March 4th, but only until the applied amount is sold out. Also, boiled water shops that have temporarily closed and have not been given application forms should submit a letter stating the reasons and bring their seals to the association to apply. Please do not delay." The remaining cases were briefly discussed. The meeting adjourned at 6:30 PM. It was also heard that the association has decided to notify its members and colleagues in the industry to continue donating to refugees for one year.

Manufacturers Determined to Punish Hoarding

Yitaixing and seven other coal briquette factories have customers with more than 20,000 tons of coal briquettes stored in their warehouses, which is clearly hoarding and speculation for profit. The First Special District Municipal Federation had previously sent letters to these factories, urging them to take strict measures against these stored goods to prevent hoarding. The Federation received a reply from Yitaixing Coal Company yesterday, stating, "We have received your letter dated February 17, and we understand your intentions. Since our factory has issued a public notice, we must strictly implement it to live up to your praise for our concern for the people's livelihood. In this extraordinary time, people's hearts are uncertain. We are doing our best to maintain market order and alleviate the people's difficulties. With your letter, we will be even more encouraged to be in the forefront of serving the public. This is our reply, and we hope for your understanding."

Citizens Suggest Group Coal Purchases

The First Special District Municipal Federation of the Seven Seas received a letter from committee members Gu Yucang and Wu Peng yesterday, stating that prices in Shanghai are soaring and there is no appropriate solution for fuel. There are many factories in Shanghai, and hundreds of thousands of people depend on them for their livelihoods, both directly and indirectly. If fuel is manipulated by speculators, creating new prices or even becoming available but not for sale, then factories will be forced to shut down, and these tens of thousands of people will have nowhere to go. This is not only a matter of security in Shanghai but also a major loss to the nation, the people, and the future of commerce. Therefore, we suggest that your Federation immediately implement group coal purchases, just as it implemented group grain purchases, so that the coal shortage can be effectively resolved, benefiting not only industry and commerce.

Related Industries Have All Raised Prices

Due to the impact of rising coal prices, various industries in the city have seen an increase in expenses. The hotel, bathhouse, and hot water industry associations have been most affected by the soaring coal prices and have separately convened committee meetings to increase prices. (1) The hotel industry association decided that hotels with water heating systems would increase prices by 20% of the original price. Those without water heating systems, which are not affected by the high coal prices, are not allowed to raise prices. (2) The bathhouse industry association issued a notice: "Coal prices are rising, and it is difficult to maintain operations. The industry association has decided to raise prices. The minimum price for a bath is set at 20 cents, and the business hours are set to start at 1:00 PM. Children who occupy seats will be charged the full bath price. This is a last resort, and we ask for your understanding." (3) The hot water industry's request for low-priced and sufficient coal supplies has not yet been fully resolved. In order to quickly resolve the coal shortage, it has been decided to convene a temporary industry representative conference on the afternoon of the 25th of this month to discuss the steps to be taken.

Letter from a Reader

Yesterday, a reader sent a letter, stating, "Editor, hasn't the fair price for coal briquettes already been implemented? It is said that the factory price is 110 yuan per ton and the retail price is 5.8 yuan per dan. But I ran around all day yesterday and couldn't buy half a coal briquette at that price. At first, I thought there were many people buying at the retail market price, or that I was a step late and they were already sold out. So I reluctantly raised 110 yuan and asked a friend to introduce me to a large coal briquette factory to buy them. Unexpectedly, I could only sigh at the coal briquettes and still couldn't buy them. When asked why, they said, 'The fair price is indeed 110 yuan, but there are no goods. If you are willing to pay 130 yuan, maybe there will be goods.' This is not just this factory; other factories are like this as well. "I ask the editor, is this considered implementing fair prices? If there are really no goods on the market, fair prices are like trying to satisfy hunger with pictures of cakes or quenching thirst with plums. If there are goods but they are unwilling to implement fair prices and deliberately deceive the public, then such hoarding and speculation is even more despicable.

### Special Police Team to Discuss Organization Today; Rumors Say Xiao'an Called a Tea Party to Convene; Japanese Side Says Many Issues Remain Unresolved

After the signing of the temporary agreement on policing the Shanghai West Extra-Settlement Roads, regarding the organization of the Zhejiang Police Team in that area, it is now rumored that Xiao'an is taking further steps to achieve the organizational goal and is putting it into action. It is heard that he will convene a meeting with the Shanghai Municipal Police today or tomorrow in order to decide everything.

Tea Party Today for Initial Contact

The Continental Times reported yesterday (19th) that "Shanghai Mayor" rumored Xiao'an will begin organizing the "Special Police Team" in the Extra-Settlement Roads area at the end of this week. It is rumored that a tea party will be held tomorrow (21st) or the 22nd to allow the Shanghai Municipal Police to make initial contact with the "Municipal Police Bureau." Major Bowan, head of the Shanghai Municipal Police; Akagi Chikashi, Special Deputy Head of the Shanghai Municipal Police; "Municipal Police Bureau Chief" Lu Yang; and his consultant, Colonel Igarashi, will attend to discuss the details of the temporary agreement signed between the Shanghai Municipal Police and the "Municipal Government."

Police Salaries Borne by the Puppet Government

The North-China Daily News reported that a Japanese embassy spokesman claimed yesterday while hosting news reporters that the salaries of police officers recommended by the Shanghai Municipal Police and assigned to the soon-to-be-organized new police force in the Western District will be paid by the "Shanghai Special Municipal Government" and will serve "Mayor" Chuan Xiao'an. The terms of the agreement between the Shanghai Municipal Police and the "Municipal Government" also include the Japanese-occupied areas west of the railway. As for the issues of pursuing criminals from settlement roads into the areas on Biyun Road and collecting donations, these have not been decided.

### Sixty Jewish People Enlist in the French Army

Prefer to Sacrifice Their Lives to Abolish National Socialism

The Continental Times reported that after the outbreak of the European War on September 3, 1939, the French Consulate General in Shanghai announced that it would accept foreign volunteers to enlist in the French army. Many German Jewish refugees who had fled to Shanghai registered, expressing their willingness to serve France and fight against Hitlerism. Up to now, more than 60 people have registered. Last week, they received a notice from the French Consulate General, and they all reported to the headquarters of the French army stationed in Shanghai on the morning of Saturday. It is still unknown whether they have received definite orders. Officials are keeping silent about this, but informed sources claim that German Jewish refugees would rather sacrifice their lives to abolish National Socialism in Germany. However, they have not yet been regarded as regular reservists and have only received notification to prepare for mobilization at any time.

### American Refugee Hospital Medical Report

Over 9,000 People Treated Free of Charge in Just Twenty-Six Months

According to a report released by the American Refugee Hospital, which is located in the Tongren Hospital on Bailinan Road, since its establishment twenty-six months ago, it has treated a total of 9,947 patients, of which 9,987 were free of charge. In January of this year, the hospital treated a total of 728 patients, of which 711 were free of charge. Since the establishment of the hospital, patients have been hospitalized for a total of 204,330 days, of which 201,678 days were free of charge. In January, patients were hospitalized for a total of 8,609 days, of which 8,460 days were free of charge. The hospital has a total of 280 beds. Since January 15, two more beds have been added. More than 10,000 people have also been vaccinated and injected with preventive vaccines.

### A Chinese National Anthem Inspires Patriotic Emotions; U.S. Marines Salute the Chinese National Anthem; Chinese People on the Street All Stand Respectfully; The People's Hearts Are Not Dead; The Chinese Nation Will Live Forever

The North-China Daily News published a letter from a reader named "PAY", stating that radical individuals believe that most Chinese people are living comfortably and indifferently, not paying attention to major events, except for those who are fighting and dying at the front lines. They should witness the scene at the U.S. Marine Corps service at the Grand Theater on Sunday (the 18th). At the end of the service, the

Chinese National Anthem

was played. Not only did the Chinese people in the theater stand respectfully to pay tribute to their country, but even those in the theater lobby and on the street who heard the national anthem stood respectfully. This situation was unprecedented. In the past, the Chinese people did not pay much attention to the meaning of the national anthem, but today, they understand that their national anthem contains the

Highest Principles of the Nation

Therefore, although I am not very familiar with the lyrics of the Chinese national anthem, I know that countless Chinese people respect the national anthem, and the national anthem is uniting the Chinese people, who used to fight among themselves, more and more closely to resist the invasion. As I write this, I would like to pay tribute to the Chinese national anthem and to China.

### After the Closure of Noodle Shops, They Petitioned the Chamber of Commerce Yesterday for Relief; Order Flour Mills to Directly Supply Flour; If Approved, They Will Definitely Sell at Fair Prices

The Shanghai Machine-Made Noodle Industry Association decided to temporarily suspend business. More than 200 noodle shops in the two concessions have stopped operating since the day before yesterday. The association sent representatives Wang Jinwen, Wu Jinyi, Wang Fuxin, Wang Haochun, and Li Bangkun to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday to petition for relief. The following is the text of their petition: Regarding the Request for Flour Mills

Direct Purchase of Goods for Use by Noodle Shops: We, the association, are deeply grateful after receiving letter No. 9775 from your chamber. In addition to stating that the Public Works Department has agreed to provide assistance, the members of our association have registered with the association. There are over 200 noodle shops in the two concessions, requiring

More than 3,000 Bags of Flour: Our association has notified them not to falsely report or over-register. Given this situation, it is mostly accurate. Although there is fair-priced flour for sale, there is too little flour to go around, and the noodle industry cannot buy it, so they cannot open for business immediately. Therefore, we beg the manufacturers to agree to supply group purchases, so that they can

Immediately Resume Business: Our association plans to handle distribution in four districts: the British Concession District, the French Concession District, the Suzhou Creek North District, and the Caojiadu District, with member stores responsible for distribution and use. We are submitting the registration lists of each store to your chamber for inspection. If our association receives fair-priced flour, each store will definitely

Sell at Fair Prices: The noodle business is mostly run by small vendors and peddlers, who make a living along the streets. If the period is extended, the small vendors will lose their livelihoods. Out of desperation, we request your chamber to find a way to provide relief so as to benefit the business and difficulties. We beg you to provide assistance and allow them to succeed in opening for business immediately and making a living. We hereby respectfully request that your chamber quickly negotiate with the manufacturers to directly supply flour so as to benefit the business. We are immensely grateful.

### Road Construction Workers Cannot Make Ends Meet

Limited Wages Threaten Starvation; Demand Moderate Wage Increase and Rice Subsidy

The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation recently received a joint request from the road workers of the Public Works Department, stating that "Due to the rising prices and the difficulty of life, we request a moderate wage increase and rice subsidy." The road workers have repeatedly requested the Public Works Department to moderately increase wages and provide rice subsidies, but we have been waiting expectantly without any response. The daily wage of 75 cents is not enough for one person to eat. Generally, the wages of other industries have increased automatically. For example, the power company has increased wages by 10 yuan per month and provided a rice subsidy of 8 yuan. The streetcar company has increased wages by 10 yuan and provided a rice subsidy of 15 yuan. The telephone company has increased wages by 10 yuan and provided a rice subsidy of 9 yuan. The water company originally paid 69 cents per day, but now it has increased it by 11 cents to 1 yuan, plus a rice subsidy of 45 cents. The French Public Works Department has increased wages by 40% or more. All of these situations occurred last year. Only our road workers have made repeated requests without success, which is very unfortunate. Now, rice has exceeded the price limit, and other prices are also rising. One day of hard work is hardly enough to provide a single meal. If this continues, we will starve to death. Even ants cherish their lives, let alone humans. Therefore, we are forced to make this final, mournful plea. We beg your Federation to have mercy on the laborers and uphold justice, conveying our request to the Public Works Department to moderately increase wages and provide a rice subsidy, so that we can simply survive. We have no unreasonable desires. We respectfully await your orders.

### Four Bicycles Circumnavigate Five Continents; An Indian Travels the World for Nine Years; Recently Passed Through Shanghai, Vividly Describing Interesting Experiences

The North-China Daily News reported that an Indian, Biqi Huashi, who loves to travel, circumnavigated the world by bicycle, traveling through five continents, which took nine years to complete. He recently passed through Shanghai on his way back to his hometown in Singapore. Bi traveled over tens of thousands of miles since he left Singapore on July 7, 1931. He used four bicycles. In 1932, Bi departed

from Guangzhou, traveling by bicycle, horseback, sampan, and train to Harbin. In Shenyang, his bicycle was stolen, so he bought another one to continue his journey, passing through Japan, the Philippines, and the East Indies to India. Bi stayed in India for about two years, during which he used two more bicycles. One was destroyed by a car in Xilong.

Bi also broke a leg and was hospitalized for three months before recovering. After recovering, Bi purchased his fourth bicycle and entered Afghanistan through the Khyber Pass. Bi said that the roads in the pass were "better than Nanjing Road." He then traveled to Europe via Baghdad and Damascus. In 19359, Bi encountered some difficulties while traveling in Czechoslovakia in the

Sudetenland. When Bi arrived in Czechoslovakia, he prepared Czech business cards. As soon as he entered the Sudetenland, he visited an official and showed him the business card. Unexpectedly, the official turned pale with anger, tore the business card to pieces, and threw it in Bi's face. Later, he was advised to prepare German business cards for use in the Sudetenland. Later, Bi traveled to Germany with twenty foreign students. One student

photographed a bridge, which led to his arrest. Otherwise, the Germans treated them quite kindly. After Bi arrived in the United States, he did not often travel by bicycle and instead traveled by car. It is said that the roads in the United States are the best in the world. In total, Bi has traveled to Malaysia, Siam, Vietnam, China, Korea, Japan, Java,

Hindustan, Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Syria, Turkey, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Hungary, Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, the United Kingdom, the United States, and East Africa, Central Africa, and South Africa.

### Japanese Coffee Shop Incident; Japanese Consulate Protests

The North-China Daily News reported that a Japanese embassy spokesman claimed yesterday (19th) while hosting news reporters that on the 13th of this month, three British soldiers vandalized windows, tables, and chairs in a Japanese coffee shop on Maithurst Road without cause, attempted to attack waitresses, and stole five bottles of wine. Regarding this matter, the Japanese Consul General in Shanghai has protested to the British Consul General, stating that the Japanese Consul General is responsible for protecting the Japanese and cannot ignore this matter. He demanded that the British officials responsible apologize and discipline the three British soldiers. The Japanese Consul General reserves the right to demand compensation.

### Japanese Ships Aggressively Occupy Ferry Landing Across the River - Commotion Erupts on the Huangpu River - Rowing Boat Gang Confronts Japanese Ferry Over Fish Market Pier, Crowd Roars

Starting at 5:00 AM yesterday, the Pudong Lujiazui ferry terminal announced its opening.  The "Huaguang Ferry Company," organized with Japanese investment, began operating tugboats on the route between the terminal and the French Concession fish market pier, aiming to profit from passenger transport. Japanese authorities had previously contacted the French Concession authorities and obtained permission to dock ferries at the fish market pier.  Today was the first day of operation, with round-trip passage offered completely free for the day.  At 5:00 AM, a small tugboat, making its maiden voyage, towed

From Lujiazui Wharf

Two ferries, carrying a hundred and several dozen passengers, towards the French Concession pier.  Unexpectedly, the original civilian ferries operating between Pudong's Dongchang Road and the Sixteen Pups area, fearing a major blow to their business after the ferries began operating and at a time of high living costs, several thousand ferrymen, inevitably unable to maintain their livelihoods, gathered over a hundred rowing boats, blocking the river surface near the fish market pier, preventing the tugboats from docking. A collective voice of resistance arose, making it impossible for the ferry to dock.  The ferry was then towed to the northern end of Roosevelt

Jiangtian Pier

To disembark passengers. In the rush, it was unable to take on passengers in the French Concession and towed back to Lujiazui empty. A second trip, also towing two ferries carrying over a hundred passengers, again attempted to dock at the French Concession fish market pier, but the rowing boats continued to gather, reaching about two hundred.  They brandished bamboo poles and oars, preparing to use force against the ferry, creating an intimidating atmosphere, as if facing a formidable enemy.  Tension suddenly rose on the river.  After more than ten minutes of confrontation, the ferry crew relented, agreeing to let the second batch of passengers disembark

Stop the Ferries

The rowing boat gang then cleared a path for the ferry, which remained docked at Jiangtian Pier.  After the passengers disembarked, it returned to Pudong and ceased operations. Therefore, the free passenger service this morning was interrupted in less than an hour. It is now heard that the impoverished ferrymen, driven by the need to survive, are still planning to find ways to demand the "ferry" cease operation.

### Ning Shao Insurance Company - Deputy Manager Weng Guangtian Accuses Staff of Defamation - Employees, Unable to Endure, File Complaint with Board of Directors - Weng Reports Three Police Officers Accused

Weng Guangtian, a Ningbo native residing at No. 18, Lane 232, Avenue Albert, has been the Deputy Manager of the Ning Shao Fire and Water Insurance Company at No. 86 Ningbo Road for three years. His relationship with the staff under him has been poor.  On January 17th of this year, the employees, feeling

Unable to Endure,

Sent a joint letter to the Board of Directors, not only launching a scathing and insulting attack on Weng Guangtian but also requesting increased subsidies.  Failing to obtain satisfaction, a work slowdown ensued on the 18th.  Slogans were plastered throughout the company, and leaflets were widely distributed, listing Weng Guangtian's six major offenses.  Weng, seeing the urgency of the situation, reported it to the General Police Station, which dispatched detectives Wu Chunrong and Cermit

To Investigate.

Afterward, Li Yanling from Shaoxing, acting accounting director, Yu Nanyang from Ningbo, head of outport fire insurance, and Zhang Yingquan from Ningbo were suspected and prosecuted according to the law. A request for a summons was issued to the First Special Court, and yesterday morning, Judge Zhong Qing presided over the Fourth Criminal Court for questioning. Weng Guangtian engaged lawyer Qian Zheng to appear in court and filed a civil suit, requesting that, in addition to being punished according to the law, the defendants also be ordered to publish an apology in the newspaper to restore his reputation.  According to Police Station lawyer Zhang Shizhu's

Statement of the Case,

A defamation charge was filed and leaflets were presented to the court.  When questioned, the three defendants denied distributing the leaflets, stating only that Weng's daily oppression of the company's junior staff was so severe and painful that it led to this reaction and that the claims in the leaflets were all true.  They also engaged lawyer Sun Zuji to defend them. Judge Zhong concluded the debate and set the verdict for the 23rd.

### Confirmation of Hidden Shareholder Rights - Plaintiff Wins

Xu Huijun, previously hiring a lawyer representing the Second Special Court Civil Division, sued Sun, wife of the late shareholder and manager Lu Tingjian, and his son Yongnian of Lao Zheng He Dyeing Factory (now renamed Mao Ji), to confirm hidden partnership equity.  The gist was that the plaintiff was employed at the Lao Zheng He Dyeing Factory. In 1916, the former owner intended to cease operations. Lu Tingjian, Wu Zhihua, and Wu Rongquan partnered to take over the original brand and rename it Mao Ji, continuing business operations, with Lu appointed as manager. At that time, the capital was one thousand yuan each. However, Lu, due to insufficient funds, only contributed three hundred yuan, so he invited the plaintiff, Xu Baochun, and Jiang Shangxian to partner, with Xu contributing three hundred yuan and the plaintiff and Jiang contributing two hundred yuan each, all under Lu's name, as hidden partners.  In 1931, the store's capital was expanded to one ten thousand yuan, and the plaintiff's two hundred yuan equity increased to two thousand yuan. However, the plaintiff and Lu had been friends for many years, so no agreement was signed. Lu had always been honest, and for twenty years, the dividends and bonuses to the plaintiff's shares were paid annually. Unexpectedly, Lu fell ill and died in Shanghai during the Mid-Autumn Festival last year. The defendants, with bad conscience, denied the plaintiff's hidden shareholder rights. Negotiations were ineffective, so they specifically sued for a judgment confirming that the plaintiff had two-tenths of the hidden shares under Lu's name. The court, based on the complaint, had Judge Chen Can hear the case. The lawyer commissioned by the defendant requested that the trial judge recuse himself. After a ruling, Judge Ma Yishu was replaced to hear the case. Yesterday's judgment stated that the plaintiff was confirmed to have a two-tenths hidden share in the defendant's shares of Lao Zheng He Mao Ji, the former Fa Ji Dyeing Factory. The litigation costs are borne by the defendant.

### Owner of Yi Da Paper Shop - Accused of Abandonment

Daughter-in-Law Sues for Support

Cao Zhao Sizhen (31 years old), a Ningbo woman, married Cao Sizhong, the son of Cao Weiheng, a Huizhou native and owner of Yi Da Paper Shop at No. 4 Lao Yong'an Street in the French Concession, through a matchmaker in 1932. They had a son named Haixiang (7 years old this year). Since the winter of 1935, Sizhong went to his ancestral home in Huizhou due to some matter, his attitude suddenly changed, and he fell in love with someone else, abandoning Zhao and her son and neglecting their livelihood. All household expenses were borne by Haixiang's grandfather, Cao Weiheng. Unexpectedly, Cao Weiheng has also recently refused to pay, leaving Zhao and her son in dire straits. Unable to cope, Zhao, along with her son Haixiang, commissioned lawyer Zhu Hefu to file a complaint with the Second Special Court Civil Division, accusing Cao Weiheng and his son, requesting a judgment for living expenses of 20,000 yuan and education expenses for Haixiang of 10,000 yuan. The court approved the complaint, and yesterday, Judge Li opened the Seventh Civil Court for hearing. The defendant refused to accept the summons and did not appear. The court hearing was adjourned and the plaintiff ordered to serve the defendant and re-examine the case.

### Overseas Chinese Returning from France with Silver - Confiscated by French Authorities

Marseilles Customs Only Permits Carrying 500 Francs According to Prohibition

Thousands of overseas Chinese in Europe have lost their jobs due to the impact of the European war and are returning to China. On the 15th of this month, the French postal ship Dartagnan arrived in Shanghai from Europe, carrying fifty or so overseas Chinese merchants and students residing in France and the Netherlands. Except for a portion of overseas Chinese merchants and students who disembarked in Hong Kong and Haiphong and transferred to the mainland, the remaining thirty-five overseas Chinese from Zhejiang, including Xia Xinying, all arrived in Shanghai on the same ship. According to Xin Sheng News Agency reporters, when the returning overseas Chinese boarded the ship in Marseilles, the local customs office, under orders, inspected departing passengers, examining the luggage of foreigners in detail. The returning overseas Chinese, having been engaged in business overseas for many years, had accumulated some savings. After deducting the ship fare, each person had approximately several tens to several hundreds of francs remaining. When carrying the remaining funds back to China to make a living, the French customs, citing the French government's restriction on carrying silver out of the country during wartime, only allowed each person to carry 500 francs and confiscated all the excess, totaling 6,000 francs, equivalent to nearly 2,000 yuan in Chinese currency. The returning overseas Chinese believe that these remaining funds are the result of hard work. Fortunately, the customs authorities issued receipts, and they plan to send a telegram to overseas Chinese in France, negotiating with French customs to recover the funds.

### Pawn Industry Discusses - Banning Gold Pledges

Currently Difficult to Implement, Business Not Highly Profitable

The Shanghai Pawn Industry Association, originally divided into new and old factions, traditionally held a general meeting of new and old members once a year on the 13th day of the first lunar month. This year, due to government orders, no general meeting or re-election could be held during the war. Instead, yesterday afternoon at around 2:00 PM, a New Year greeting meeting was held at the association's location on Baker Road. More than fifty member pawnshops and representatives attended, presided over by Wu Qiutao. General opinions on business operations were exchanged, and important agreements were reached. It was heard that the Ministry of Finance's order prohibiting gold pledges was discussed. However, it is understood that due to business difficulties, it is currently difficult to implement. According to the chairman of the association, Wu Qiutao, speaking to Da Guang News Agency, last year the industry restored the two-percent monthly interest rate, which caused much public grumbling. Also, due to the high price of overdue clothing packages, the outside world, unaware of the reality, also believes that the pawn industry is highly profitable. In fact, the pawn industry still has an eighteen-month term, with only a two-percent weekly interest rate. Pawned goods, due to the rise of those buying pawn tickets, the common people turned the pawn tickets into cash, and overdue pawned goods are less than two-tenths of the previous years. In particular, gold and silver jewelry, due to rising prices, have been completely redeemed. Although each pawnshop had a slight profit last year, the amount was small and only enough to offset its large expenses. The future business prospects of the remaining fifty or so members who are still operating cannot be overly optimistic.

### Yang Ge Suffers Hardships in Prison - Provoking Outrage from American Community - Sleeping on Cement Floor Causes Illness - Not Questioned Since Arrest

According to the English "Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury," information received from Shanghai today (20th) states that Yang Ge, an American international communication Tokyo interviewer, was arrested and imprisoned for disseminating information that was disliked by the Japanese side. After nearly a month, he became ill due to the unbearable prison conditions. Yang Ge suffers from an ear infection and severe joint pain, caused by being forced to sleep on a cement floor without blankets for warmth. The Japanese authorities did not allow Yang Ge to shower. After the US Embassy in Tokyo strongly protested, Yang was allowed to change clean shirts weekly. Although some people believe that Yang will be tried by a military court, he has not been summoned to any court for questioning since his arrest on January 21st. The laws imposed on Yang Ge by the Japanese side have caused great outrage among the American community in Shanghai and in American public opinion. It is reported that Yang Ge was arrested because the Japanese authorities were dissatisfied with his statements and information based on his observations and thoughts in Shanghai and Tokyo.

### Chamber of Commerce Again Requests Release - Hengfeng Dyeing Factory's Fabric Detained

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce reiterated to the Yongkang inspection agency yesterday that the Hengfeng Textile New Bureau, which was banned by the Ministry of Economics, had no relation to Hengfeng Printing and Dyeing Factory: "The name Hengfeng is used by factories, so whether a factory is designated to be banned by the Ministry of Economics should be determined based on whether its full name matches. These two names are: Hengfeng Textile New Bureau and Hengfeng Printing and Dyeing Factory. One has six characters and the other has seven, with only Hengfeng being identical. Regarding their business, one is spinning and weaving, and the other is printing and dyeing. Regarding their history, one was opened in 1890 on Huasheng Road, Yangshupu, Shanghai, and the other was established in Shanghai as a branch factory of the Ningbo Main Factory. Regarding their location, one is in the Japanese-controlled area and the other is in the French Concession neutral zone. Regarding the founders, one is operated by Nie Qijie of Hengshan County, Hunan Province, and the other is jointly operated by Wang Jiarui, Wang Hanzhi, and Hong Yongqiao. Based on the above circumstances, it can be shown that they are completely unrelated and are two separate factories. We hereby certify sincerely, hoping that the detained goods will be released quickly, for the sake of public enterprise."

### Xu Zhifei's Unit Revolts

Xu Zhifei's unit of the armed police team, formed last year in Gaojiahang Nanxing Town, Pudong, was a team under the former guerrilla captain Zhang Huifang. The team nominally obeyed the command of the Japanese instructor Hattori Ichiue due to circumstances, secretly maintaining contact with Zhang Chunfang's guerrillas in the South Chuan coastal area and providing Japanese intelligence to Zhang's unit. As a result, the Japanese troops in the South Chuan area were ambushed by Zhang's unit from time to time, suffering heavy losses. Unexpectedly, this secret was discovered by the Japanese army. At 2:00 PM the day before yesterday, more than two hundred naval infantrymen were transferred from the Gaoqiao area to Gao Hang Nan Xing Town, intending to surround Xu's unit, disarm them, and wipe them out in one fell swoop. However, the secret was leaked and discovered by Xu's unit. They evacuated three hours before the arrival of the Japanese army, retreating to the area controlled by Zhang Huifang's unit at the Caijialukou east of the town. The Japanese army, finding nothing, retreated along the original route in frustration. After Xu's unit arrived in the safe zone, they immediately revolted. Overnight, under the instructions of Zhang Huifang, they sailed out to sea and headed to Qidong to be stationed, awaiting reorganization and conducting national salvation work.

### Dredging Bureau Decides to First - Sound the Huangpu River Channel

Dredging to Start in Early Next Month

Because only a small portion of the Dredging Bureau's dredgers have been returned by the Japanese side, the bureau has difficulty in restoring the dredging work in the Huangpu River. However, several surveying vessels have been returned, so the bureau decided to first sound the Huangpu River channel. Once surveyed, dredging will be carried out in sections at obstacle locations, so the official start date for dredging must be in early next month. Also, there will be high tides in the Huangpu River again from tomorrow, all exceeding ten feet.

### New Drug Trademark - Revocation and Re-Evaluation

Yesterday, the National New Pharmaceutical Industry Federation received a decision from the Ministry of Economic Affairs stating that the appellant, the National United Association of New Pharmaceutical Industries, filed an appeal against the Trademark Bureau's assessment and re-evaluation of a trademark dispute case. The decision of the Ministry is as follows: The Trademark Bureau's No. 225 assessment and No. 92 re-evaluation are both revoked. Facts: The German Dade Paint Factory previously registered six trademarks for Western medicine products: "Aspirin" blue, "Color Spleen," "Bayer Pharmaceutical Cross Style," "Bayer Cross," "Aspirin Aspirin," and "Bayer Cross." The trademarks were approved and registered for renewal by the Trademark Bureau and listed as Nos. 780, 917, 918, 16302, 1630, and 17924. The appellant subsequently filed a request for evaluation on the grounds that the scope of exclusive use of the trademark was unclear or that it was a product name and could not be exclusively used according to law. The Trademark Bureau ruled that "the appellant's request is unfounded" and issued assessment No. 225. The appellant, dissatisfied, requested a re-evaluation on the grounds that the "Aspirin" and Chinese "Aspirin" trademarks had become generic terms, violating Articles 1, paragraph 2, Article 14, and Article 1, paragraph 5 of the Trademark Law. The bureau re-evaluated the matter and found that the grounds were still lacking and upheld the original assessment. The re-evaluation No. 92 was then distributed. The appellant remains dissatisfied and appealed to the Ministry.

Xue Guanming and Zhou Bin were sentenced to 13 years imprisonment for jointly kidnapping for ransom, and Wu Peng was sentenced to 8 years imprisonment.

Unexpectedly, when passing near the intersection of Daxilu and Zhongshan Road, six bandits suddenly rushed out, each wielding a pistol, preventing her from crying out. They searched her person but found nothing. They dragged her into a Jiangbei shed in the area, where the bandits raped her in turns. By noon, they drove her out. She suffered severe injuries to her lower body and walked with difficulty, collapsing at the Daxilu intersection. She was then sent to the hospital for treatment.

### The Gold Market, Newly Quelled - Surges Again Yesterday - 100 Yuan Up - Sycee Silver Exchanges at Four and a Half Yuan

The cash red-red black market situation yesterday rose again, especially in the afternoon. It returned to the 4,800 yuan range. It was a sudden tightening of foreign exchange, coupled with the Jinbang from time to time to continue to frantically buying, resulting in people again tending to be firm and expensive. The result was a sharp rise of more than 100 yuan. The morning was quite lack of vitality, opening at a low price of 4,700 yuan, down 28 yuan, because the exchange market was loose and the gold houses were sold. Then the securities gangs bought in, and foreign exchange at that time turned steady, rising 40 yuan. But the gold houses were still full of supply, and it dropped to 4,715 yuan again. Later, the exchange market returned to normal, and it was heard that HSBC was very good at eating stomach, and people were shocked, and the buying wind rose. A securities gang increased its absorption, and a money exchange also tracked and searched for Hong Kong gang. At the same time, retail investors also bought in, so at noon, the market rose to 4,785 yuan. However, at the close, the silver building gang took profits and turned, so it slightly reduced by several yuan. In the afternoon, because the exchange market reported soft, and the Jinbang advanced sharply, the trend was more firm and delicate, and soon after opening, it rose to 4,845 yuan. After the entry, a gold house and silver building gang were still willing to sell at a high price, so the late close was 4,830 yuan, 102 yuan higher than the previous day. The whole day's transaction was still smooth, about 3,500 taels or more. Silver building gold hung up 5 yuan, and sycee silver also rose 5 jiao. Customs gold and other things are still flat. The gold for silver building jewelry was initially 480 yuan for Datonghang, but at 2:15 in the afternoon, it was increased by 5 yuan. As a result, Datonghang changed to 485 yuan. The new trade price is the same, reducing the intake by about 15 yuan. In addition, the exchange price of each tael of sycee silver was changed to 4 yuan 5 jiao by Datonghang, which is 5 jiao higher.

### Chinese Merchants Close Out - This Month's Foreign Exchange

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation, HSBC's listing, still has no ups and downs, the British and American Exchange's black market, the situation first loose and then step tight, the result slightly declared softened, because HSBC came to suck in again, too. To the day's passage, first, the overseas American and British exchange again reduced by six or one or five, so the opening showed the phenomenon of British peace and American tension, followed by the fact that Hong Kong electricity was congested first, and the Chinese merchants sold this month's share, so it was seen that the steps were hard, once the British rose to more than four pence two five, and the US Exchange seven yuan, but HSBC had quite an appetite for the above selling price, so the oil foreign firms came to buy and settle, and at that time a few Chinese merchants turned to the March futures long to increase their bets, so the market quickly returned to normal. Although the profits of this month's floating shares continued to close out, and the weight-shaped micro-hardness, but foreign firms such as Yale had a good stomach, so until the close, they were still four pence two one eight seven five and six yuan nine three seven five. In the afternoon, the initial opening was declared soft, and then HSBC continued to pick up and suck, and the Japanese yarn factory also came to settle in the April pre-order, so soon it tightened to four pence seven one eight seven five, and six yuan eight seven five. The tendency was slightly better, and until the late close, the US Exchange was still six yuan eight seven five, and British gold was four pence one eight seven five. The result was 〇3125 and 〇9375 tighter than the previous day. The potential of futures is the same as that of spot goods.

### Breaking the Silence - Rubber Stocks Suddenly Rise

The black market for securities, yesterday's market situation has slackened, and various rumors transmitted from the next day have not been confirmed, and the Nanjing rumors have intensified. The morning market closed only slightly better than the next day, but in the afternoon, there was little activity again. Public bonds cannot rise, and they are often attacked unintentionally. According to the current situation, the sudden entry and exit of floating accounts, and the scattered buying and selling of retail investors, have little to do with the debt market. There are very few multi-shorts of more than one million, and the environment cannot be significantly stimulated, and cannot arouse significant Poland. Yesterday's initial opening was in good shape, Lianyi Juxin and retail investors bought in quite a bit, and then the gold gradually returned to high, and people were empty again. Jiufeng continued to sell out, and Tongkang, Tongshun, Datong, and Xieda all supplied. The market price gradually went downstream, and the results continued to be slightly better by five points to three jiao, but in the afternoon, it still tended to be small, and the transaction was about four to fifty million yuan. The following is a brief table:

Category Highest Lowest Closing Previous Day

Stock Trading, 20 shares of Zhejiang Industrial Bank were traded, priced at 100 yuan.

Yesterday's stock market, opened firm and expensive, but the profit-taking trend was booming, the market situation was downstream, but not very drastic, as in the past, the shares that plummeted the most during the return were also the most vigorous during the rise, such as the public bus once saw 35 and a half yuan at the highest time, and closed at 33 yuan for the sale.

The exchange market returned to soft again, and the trend of rubber shares was firmer, it is worth noting that Ketaba Road rose to 9 and a half yuan, the Rubber Trust created a high price of 15 yuan, and Langezhi had a transaction at a high price of 39 yuan and 7 corners and a half.

According to market news, rubber stocks have been silent for a long time, because the current speculation is concentrated in traffic stocks and industrial stocks, and the rubber stocks are put on hold, which is not the time for active rise. Since this newspaper disclosed the letter from Mr. Xin'an yesterday, it has aroused general attention, and those who ask about it have suddenly flourished. It must be known that speculative business, no matter what kind of stock, has its chance to make profits, and has its dangers, this must not be careless.

The Shanghai Huachang Foreign Company's Shengjiala Rubber Tree Co., Ltd. is scheduled to pay a second interim dividend for the 1939 to 1940 financial year on March 4th, at a price of two corners of national currency per share.

### Raw Cotton Unloose, Yarn Prices Rise Again

The cotton yarn market, which had been declining sharply for days, stabilized yesterday. This was mainly because raw cotton prices remained unloose, even showing an upward trend, leading to increased production costs for factories. Manufacturers were reluctant to sell, and sentiment remained cautious. However, some, due to high prices, tended to offload their holdings, while sales to outside customers remained undeveloped, leaving the market in a state of uncertainty. Nevertheless, those absorbing the yarn with financial backing did not give up, and continued to buy on dips to increase their positions.

The morning opening of the yarn market was overshadowed by rumors from the afternoon of the previous day, with short sellers actively calling for selling. However, there was no shortage of buyers. 20-count Double Horse yarn opened at $823, and buyers crowded in. At the same time, reports of a slight tightening in foreign exchange rates led to a gradual rise in market prices to $837 or $838. However, trading in March yarn had already begun, with prices about $15 higher than for February yarn, mostly by arbitragers selling out. Midday trading volume was 1,705 bales, with 10-count Double Horse yarn rising by $4. In the afternoon, rumors of a reduction in foreign exchange and rising gold prices stirred the unofficial market, causing yarn prices to rise by more than $10. Today, 223 pieces of yarn were shipped to Hong Kong. The amounts bought by various groups are listed below:

Fellow traders: 1,485
Inland: 120

Hong Kong: 80
Amoy: 10

Fuzhou: 10
Total: 1,705

### Low Inventory, Cotton Merchants Await Good Sales

Cotton trading was similar to the previous day. Some market participants expected a slight pullback, but those holding cotton were firm in their resolve, refusing to sell unless at a good price. The morning market was relatively calm, but in the afternoon, news of tightening exchange rates led to higher asking prices, with some claiming they could not buy in. Tongzhou cotton traded at $205, mainly due to low inventory. There was no expectation of increased supply. 209 bales of Subei cotton arrived in Tongzhou. The current cotton situation is listed below:

### Abundant Rice Supply Expected, Foreign Rice Plummets, Wuxi Grain Reserves Sufficient, Rice Merchants Break Price Controls

The rice market had been declining, and the fall intensified yesterday. This was due to reports that certain parties were collecting rice from inland areas such as Kunshan, Xiqing, and Sisi, and transporting it to Shanghai to sell at good prices. In addition, large quantities, often 1,000 to 3,000 bags, had been transferred out of the Hongkou district recently. Market speculation led to panic. Merchants with large inventories were eager to sell, and hoarders also rushed to liquidate their holdings. At the same time, those buying from outside the city held the same view and were unwilling to buy more. As a result, sellers dumped their holdings indiscriminately, while buyers turned a blind eye, creating a situation where rice was being sold but not bought. Foreign rice prices plummeted by over $2 from morning to noon, with few sales. No. 1 Saigon rice was at $48, then $47.50; No. 2 was at $46, then $45.50; Fire-milled rice was at $46; Tokyo polished rice was at $43, then $41.50; Broken rice was at $35. In the afternoon, rumors spread in the market, and some small traders and hoarders absorbed some rice, causing the market to rebound by 60 to 80 cents. No. 1 rice recovered to $49; No. 2 to $47.70 or $47.80. Other prices followed suit. New transactions, due to high shipping costs, only amounted to 200 to 300 tons, while liquidations reached 2,000 tons. Small-milled rice initially fell to $55.50, then rose by 50 cents, finally reaching $56.50. No. 2 Saigon rice was at $55.60 in the afternoon, then $56.20. No. 2 Siam rice was at $55.85.

The market for white rice from other regions was also sluggish, with few transactions. Liyang special rice sold for only $45; Danyang white rice for $43, a drop of $1 or $2 from before. Even thick and thin japonica rice was difficult to manipulate. There were no unofficial market transactions reported.

In the Wuxi rice market, various businesses and factories held a tea party on the 18th to conduct business as usual. Initially, they adhered to the price limit of $27 per picul of white rice. However, samples of unpolished white rice, japonica rice, and indica rice were nowhere to be found, as a form of resistance. Rice merchants were unable to replenish their stocks, causing panic in the market. Some businesses shifted their attention to unrestricted glutinous rice, glutinous rice paddy, and other grains, causing glutinous rice paddy to jump by $2 per dan, and other grains to rise in price. The market situation became chaotic, leaving buyers helpless. Retail merchants were unable to maintain operations. Leaders of the Rice Milling Association, seeing this situation, immediately gathered all businesses and strongly urged them to gradually reduce the price limit of $27 per picul. Rice retailers were instructed to maintain the current situation for the time being and to determine implementation methods later. Currently, Wuxi's storage facilities hold approximately 550,000 piculs of japonica rice, 45,000 piculs of indica rice, 65,000 piculs of Yuan rice, 20,000 piculs of white japonica rice, 38,000 piculs of green and yellow soybeans, 13,000 piculs of mung beans, 6,000 bags of wheat, 700 piculs of barley, 2,000 piculs of corn, 3,000 piculs of sorghum, 400 piculs of broad beans, and 2,000 piculs of white sesame. Hoarders control 80% of these supplies. Rice merchants have stopped selling in bulk and are only selling small quantities. The Wuxi rice market remains extremely unstable. (Reported)

### Flour and Wheat Plunge After Flat-Pricing Implemented

Since the implementation of flat-pricing for factory flour, sentiment has softened. However, those holding warehouse receipts are still unwilling to sell in large quantities, especially for the Green Cannon brand destined for export, which is being quoted at the highest prices. It is rumored that the market has fallen by 40 cents due to unfavorable conditions. The warehouse receipts for the Red and Blue Car brands are closely related to the flat-priced flour and have been severely impacted by weak demand, causing them to plummet to $14.50. Transferred warehouse receipts were even lower by 20 cents. Phoenix brand was only at $14.60 or $14.70. Trading volume was estimated at 3,000 to 5,000 bags.

Wheat has also turned downward. Since the implementation of flat-pricing for flour, the market for returned goods has declined. At the same time, rice prices have also eased. Factories, expecting wheat arrivals, have loosened their buying interest. Foreign traders and exporters are also taking the opportunity to suppress prices, resulting in a price drop from $27.50 to $27. Ten cars of wheat from Suzhou, Changzhou, and Wuxi were reportedly traded at prices 50 cents lower than previous prices.

### Soybean Oil Falls then Rises

Yesterday's soybean oil market initially followed the weak trend of the previous day. The opening was unstable, and due to unfavorable conditions, Dalian crude oil fell by $3 from the previous day to $114. Later, sporadic buying interest from inland areas, coupled with the sharp drop in price, having fallen $9 from the highest price ($123 on the 23rd), triggered strong buying sentiment. Speculators took the opportunity to bid up prices, with transactions of five or ten barrels at a time. The closing price was up $1 from the previous day at $119. However, the trading volume was only 100 barrels. Other oil prices were also lifted. 50 cases of Jiaozhou oil were traded at $86; 40 barrels of Bengbu oil at $114 or $116; 20 barrels of Jiangbei oil at $117.50; 50 barrels of Hankou oil at $116 or $117; and 200 dan of Daya factory oil at $96.

Today, 2,380 bags of soybeans and 500 tins of sesame oil will be shipped to Hong Kong.

### Concern that Flat-Priced Coal Briquettes Fail to Become Widespread

After repeated consultations between various public groups and the Machine-Made Coal Briquette Industry Association, the factory price of coal briquettes was lowered and flat-price sales began yesterday. However, according to reporter investigations, each factory is shipping only a small amount of goods due to settling old orders, so flat-priced goods have not become widespread. As a result, various firewood and charcoal stores in the market have failed to sell according to regulations, and the market price is chaotic, ranging from $6.80 to $6.20 per dan, or even $5.80, but restrictions are quite strict.

### Flat-Priced Flour Should Not Be Sold by the Bag

— Xin Meng

Ordinary People Still Cannot Afford Flat-Priced Flour, Beneficiaries Are Noodle Shops and Flatbread Stalls

Due to the repeated rise in flour prices, the concessions started selling flour at a flat price from the 19th. The market price is over $15 per bag, but the flat-priced flour is only $10.30, a difference of $4 or $5 per bag. This news was naturally sensational. On the first day of flat-price sales, the writer went to several flour mills to observe, and as a result, I wanted to express some opinions on the flat-price sales of flour:

The flat-price sale of flour is different from the flat-price sale of rice, because this time the flat-price sale is in units of one bag, and it is really a difficult problem for those poor households to come up with the whole number of $10.30. So on the first day of flat-price sales, I found that those who bought flour were all apprentices, proprietresses, and even the entire staff of noodle shops or fried dough stick and flatbread stalls. They all set off together, so they could buy more bags of flour. At the same time, in order to buy tickets first and then collect flour, some people bought two or three bags, while others could not buy even one bag.

Since those who bought flat-priced flour are stores that sell flour products, all flour products, whether noodles, fried dough sticks, flatbreads, or steamed buns, have recently increased in price. If those noodle shops and fried dough stick and flatbread stalls buy flat-priced flour and do not reduce the price of the noodles they sell, then the result of the flat-price sale of flour is that the noodle shops and fried dough stick and flatbread stalls are the beneficiaries, and ordinary people still do not benefit.

The flat-price sale of flour must continue, and we hope that the flat-price sale method can be improved immediately, such as using one yuan as the unit, just like the flat-price sale of rice, and increasing the quantity of flour; only in this way can it be popularized to the general public, and it is also a way to limit the owners of noodle shops and flatbread stalls from taking advantage of the cheap goods.

### Broaden the "No-Perm Movement"

— Ruo Wu

Love of beauty is human nature, especially for women, and even more so for women in the city. They are researching and developing their beauty from neck to foot. For example, what kind of cosmetics should be used for facial makeup; how can the style, color, and lines of clothes be coordinated with coats and leather shoes; and other things such as curling and perming hair and dyeing fingernails with rouge. In fact, beauty is not just about external appearance. The lack of exercise among urban women and living in an environment that harms their health has already neglected the most important conditions for beauty. The results of external decoration may not be able to remedy the main defects.

Today, I saw in the newspaper that the Women's Federation received a proposal from Ms. Qin Shuluan to promote a no-perm movement for women. From the perspective of beauty, perms are not necessarily beautiful; from the perspective of economy, it is really a waste. Furthermore, the efforts of general prostitutes and dancers to decorate themselves externally are to please the paying party. Various strange costumes and enchanting decorations are mostly created by them. Regarding their depravity and using their appearance to please people, we, as fellow women, should pity them, sympathize with them, and even rescue them. Then why should we follow in their footsteps and be like them?

Therefore, I very much agree with Ms. Qin's proposal, but it should be extended further, from no perms to no rouge, no high heels, no strangely shaped clothes, etc.

Spend the time and money saved doing some meaningful work.

### Pay Attention When Buying Rice: Be Sure to Watch the Weighing Lever

— Cheng

The day before yesterday, I bought a dan of rice at a well-established rice store. When it was delivered, I borrowed a scale from the oil store and asked the delivery guy to help weigh it. Each nine dou weighed a very high eighty catties. A friend who lived with me saw that the weight was good and also wanted a dan. After a while, another delivery guy came, and he also helped weigh it, again at a very high eighty catties. But when weighing that bag again, I suddenly noticed that the delivery guy was pressing the weighing lever with his right elbow, and the weight was tilted up. I was very suspicious and told my friend to have someone else weigh it. The weight immediately dropped, missing five catties. When the weighed bag was re-weighed, it was also missing five catties. My friend asked him to take it back, make it up, and deliver it again, and he took it away without hesitation. As a result, my dan of rice was also missing ten catties. Because I didn't check it at the time, when I went to talk to him afterwards, he certainly wouldn't admit it. A dan is $50, and ten catties is worth more than $2. In this period of extremely expensive food, they are still so black-hearted! I don't know if it is the store owner deceiving customers and teaching the delivery guys tricks; or if the delivery guys are cheating. I don't know if other rice stores are the same. Not every buyer has a market scale at home, or can borrow one from outside; even if they have a scale, they can be deceived if they are not careful. Please allow me to use a corner of the "Essays" section to expose this ghostly trick.

### After the Rain, the Sky Clears

Chapter 20: World Transportation, Shared Language, Children's Education, Cherishing Talent

Ye Songfen said, "Jiang Jingrong, I know your heart. But I will never allow my good friend to drop out of school. I must find a way. Although selling newspapers is also self-reliance, it is too hard. Can you really be a newspaper seller for the rest of your life?" They had been talking in the alley for more than ten minutes. Old Zhang Ma was calling her young master to eat porridge and snacks. Jiang Jingrong said, "I have to deliver newspapers. If I delay, people will be dissatisfied. Let's talk about it later." In the evening, Ye Songfen discussed it with his father. His father said, "Such a virtuous and filial child will definitely be successful in the future. We are naturally willing to help him. But this is not only about helping him get into school, but also about taking care of his family. Didn't he say that his selling newspapers helps his mother? The income from selling newspapers every day can subsidize the family or help his younger sister go to school. Now we subsidize his tuition and let him go to middle school, but he doesn't have the income from selling newspapers, so he still can't help his mother. So you tell him not to sell newspapers, but he is a little unwilling. Alas! This child is too good." Ye Songfen said, "Father, you keep saying that the child is too good and has a future. Why don't you think about how to help him? Let's bring his mother and two younger sisters to our house altogether. His mother doesn't have to work anymore, and we can help his sisters go to school. Wouldn't that be the end of it?" His father said, "Bah! You're just talking nonsense. No one has ever helped people like that. And you need to know that the more ambitious people are, the less willing they are to lightly accept favors. Do you think that helping others means that I can do whatever I want with them? I have a plan. Our silk weaving factory is now recruiting some apprentices. Originally, we were preparing to recruit junior high school graduates, but I think his level may be enough. If there is anything lacking, he can make it up. Originally, there were specialized textile schools in foreign countries, but unfortunately our country doesn't have that kind of school, so we have to practice in the factory. Chinese textiles have always adhered to old methods and have not been improved. It has only been in recent years that wooden looms have been changed to iron looms. However, the engineers in our factory have all returned from foreign countries after learning specialized techniques, and they are willing to teach people wholeheartedly. I intend to teach the boy named Jiang to become an apprentice in our factory. He is really what is called an artisan. We don't want his tuition, and we can give him some subsidies. I think he only earns ten or so yuan a month selling newspapers. Wouldn't it be great if we gave him ten or so yuan a month in subsidies?" It is precisely:

There are many orphans who can be motivated to endure, how can we bear to teach children not to be famous?

Shanghai Call for Papers

### Where Is the Light?

— He Jiaju

London in the fog has fallen into the war god's net, prosperous Paris is on guard against air raids, and our first metropolis in the East is getting darker day by day.

The newspapers are filled with grandiose advertisements, "Elegant Music Halls," "Resort Destinations," which are really tempting; but in a small corner, "Unable to Make a Living, Suicide by Poison." It is really the most tragic thing in the world, but few people pay attention.

The all-powerful rice merchants hoard white rice, causing the price of food to skyrocket, "Rice price $50," "Flatbreads one-third of a cent each," starving the bellies of the poor. But these bloated merchants earn enough money to "throw away thousands of dollars" in the dance halls and "bet everything" in the gambling dens. What a contradictory thing this is!

There are even those people who, for the sake of "enjoyment," disregard "conscience" and "reputation," forget their motherland, forget their nation, and forget their own future.

In this city, what is exposed before people's eyes is debauchery, shamelessness, fraud... We can only see sneers, we can only hear weeping.

Fortunately, in the midst of suffering, there are still countless people pursuing the light!

Where is the light? It is up to us to find it!

### Miscellaneous Comments on Jing Opera Actors from the North Coming South During the New Year

— Bi

Since the Lunar New Year, many famous Jing Opera actors from Beijing have been performing at the Golden and Updated theaters. The reporter has watched them in turn, and now briefly describes the actors' skills as follows:

Xi Xiaobo: He has indeed improved a lot compared to when he followed Mei Lanfang. This gentleman's art was originally based on Yan Ju, but now it is completely similar to Wen Ru. However, there are still many Yan tastes in the singing (this is due to Yan Ju), and the movements are very good (this is due to learning from Ma Lianliang). However, his short stature and poor stage presence are his shortcomings. His voice is thin and narrow, but high and bright, which is suitable for Shanghai people's tastes, so Xiaobo can become popular this time.

Hou Fulan: She is one of the best female actors to emerge later. The reporter recently listened to her twice, and her voice was not as enjoyable as the last time she came with Yan Ju. However, her movements, stage steps, and water sleeves are all excellent, and she is completely in the Cheng Yanqiu style.

Li Yanxiu: Her singing is extremely moving and she is good at using tunes. She has made quite an achievement in learning from Xiao Yun, and she can act. She is very lively on stage. Although she is a bit fat, she has not lost her beauty. She is a talent that can be cultivated with more effort. Her performance at the Updated theater this time has a drawing power no less than that of Xin Yanqiu, which is not due to luck.

Gao Shenglin: He has excellent personal relationships offstage and seems to be more popular than Wu Yanheng.

Ru Fu Hui Jiu: He is a famous clown from the North. Shanghai people have not forgotten him, and the audience always applauds him when he appears on stage. He is a noteworthy supporting actor who came with Xi Xiaobo.

Chen Shengtai: This is his first time in Shanghai, and the audience praises him as the second Jiang Shifu, a rare rising star. Shengtai's appearance, movements, and singing are all good, but his voice is similar to that of a female actor, so his singing is not very moving, but he is very popular with the audience.

Zhao Qixia: She is a famous female actor who is known for her martial and flower roles, but her voice is not good, so she has not become popular. She came with Li Yanxiu this time and has not been able to show her talents, which is a pity.

Wang Shaoting: He is an old male actor brought by Xi Xiaobo. Shaoting's voice is the same as Xiaobo's, so they match each other perfectly.

Li Debin: He is a young male actor brought by Li Yanxiu. He used to come to Shanghai with Song Dezhu. Although his skills are commendable, unfortunately, the Updated theater already has Yu Zhenfei and Zhu Fushou, so Debin has no use for his talents.

In addition, the Updated theater has many other Jing Opera actors who are not here for the New Year, so they are not listed.

### A Generation of Popular Actors, Demise of Fragrant Jade (Part 2) All Aspects of Zhang Wenyan

— Sick Dove

My friend at the time wrote a poem to praise her, saying: "Her new voice is as crisp as an oriole, enjoying the amorous glances from her horizontal eyes, most touching is her affectionate performance, this darling has been clever since she was little." He also attached a preface: "She has the charm of Madame Mei, the glance of Madame Lai; the wildness of Zhuo Wenjun, and the charming cuteness of Yuan Bao'er; her singing voice is like the new chirping of an oriole, and her talent is also superior to her peers. Her performance in flower-shirt operas is famous for a time, especially her rendition of Rouge Tiger Spinning Cotton, which is hailed as an absolute masterpiece. However, when she plays Qingyi, she often loses her licentiousness." The commentary is appropriate, and is a true record. In fact, Wenyan does not have many plays that she is good at. Except for the Xiaohua Dan opera, which is still worth watching, the rest, such as "Mei Long Zhen" and "Chunxiang Making Trouble in School," are not qualified. The key to acting is understanding. Unbridled licentiousness only makes the audience happy for a while, and is not the right path. Moreover, her voice is soft and charming, which is not suitable for Qingyi opera. I have seen her perform "Bao Lian Deng," and the stiffness of her movements, water sleeves, and steps is completely different from her performance in Flower-date operas. Her talent is only one strength, and she is not an all-rounder.

Anecdotes about Wenyan

Wenyan performed with the longest-lasting class at the Gongwu Stage (formerly the Bulinli site) in the French Concession. At that time, there were many people who coveted her beauty and wanted to seduce her. There was a certain Mr. A who was over forty years old and was deeply fascinated by Wenyan. He went to watch her every night. One day, after Wenyan finished performing, she saw Mr. A following her on her way home, following her step by step, murmuring words in his mouth. Wenyan noticed and scolded him, but he ignored her and continued to follow her. When she was about to reach her residence, Mr. A suddenly became bold and rushed forward to hug her, wanting to kiss her forcibly. He was only chased away after the police were called. This is also an interesting story. Wenyan was highly praised, and those who did not receive her favor were jealous of her, so slanderous words arose like bees. Some said that Wenyan had a strong desire and many ugly deeds, and some said that Wenyan had a price for her nightly voyages and was openly a prostitute. This was obviously jealousy and slander, and not worth laughing at. Although Wenyan is not as solitary and inviolable as her sister, she knows how to restrain her behavior and is still a good woman.

### "The Wedding Night"

— Si Ying

Premiering Tomorrow

Mr. Xia Yan's "The Wedding Night" is a very successful play in terms of writing skills, style creation, and subject matter selection. It gives a powerful blow to pessimists who believe in failure, and it also comforts and encourages many people who are hesitant about the development of reality. Naturally, the performance of "The Wedding Night" at this time and place is a very meaningful thing. The Great Bell Drama Club will perform it for four consecutive days starting on the 22nd at the Russian Art Institute at No. 1051 Foch Road. The director is Xu Xingzhi, and the cast is also very strong, including Hu Daozhou, Lü Jiweila, and others, who are all the best artists of the moment. This play had a preview performance yesterday afternoon. I was invited by my brother Xingzhi to watch it and found it very satisfying. Mr. Xia Yan is able to infuse unusual passion and excitement into his light writing, and he is especially able to suit the tastes of the general public, which is commendable and admirable. Performing this play at this time and place is like hearing the midnight bell awakening people! (Pleasant)

Movie Story

### The Adventures of Pinocchio

— Yi Fan, Translated

Pinocchio's Awakening

After swimming across the wide sea, climbing over mountains and valleys, and walking a long distance, he finally arrived home. It was already a snowy winter. The home, the dilapidated home, the furniture inside was covered with dust. Pinocchio called out, "Father! Father, I'm back!" But there was no response, only the angry northwest wind was roaring loudly outside the window.

Old Gepetto was gone. Pinocchio had lost his loving father. He was disappointed and sad, and tears kept falling like beads. A gust of wind rose, and suddenly a letter blew in. Pinocchio hurriedly wanted to read it, but because he was illiterate, he could only stare blankly. Jiminy Cricket read it and learned that the old carpenter had gone to save Pinocchio, but had been on a boat in the Terror Strait and all the people on the boat (including his kitten and goldfish) had fallen into the mouth of the "Sea Demon King" whale.

Pinocchio woke up and suddenly became very brave. He was no longer the selfish, weak, and confused little puppet he used to be. He decided to go to the bottom of the sea to save his father, no matter how dangerous it was. But the sea was far away, how could he get there?

Just when he was in trouble, a beautiful white dove flew from the sky. It wore a golden crown and stood in the snow, saying, "Pinocchio, I'm here to take you to the sea."

This dove was the Blue Fairy. She had found the letter in a wine bottle on the sea surface and sent it over, but Pinocchio didn't know anything about it. He and Jiminy rode on the dove, spread their wings and flew away. Gradually, the village below became very small, disappearing into a cloud of white. (Eight)

Special Yunhu Qu Tale

### Reflections After Watching a Qilin School Performance (Part Two)

— Su Shaoqing

Following this, there were two more scenes where his performance was entirely perfect. There are few actors in the entire country whose performances can reach such a beautiful level. Not only beautiful, but also with inner acting, which comes from diligent study and contemplation. Besides Xin Fang, many people learn from him, but they always have a bookish air about them. It’s like old porcelain, with all the fiery qualities gone, and a unique appearance. The color has a jewel-like light, which is far inferior in imitations. Now I have a feeling that the founder of the Qilin School, Zhou Xinfang, can perform in big cities and leave his style as a model for those who have not studied it to imitate and refer to. As for those who have not fully learned the Qilin School style and whose fiery qualities have not dissipated, they can go to the countryside to perform. Their extra effort is enough to stimulate the minds of the rural masses (because asking present-day gentle actors with soft singing voices to perform would only result in being booed off stage). Now, the countryside is in need of drama, and the new Qilin School is perfectly suited for it.

The齋主 said, Zhou Xinfang is a born genius. If he were born in the north and possessed a fine voice, he would be able to conquer the north and south and be on par with the great king of the acting world, Tan Xinpei. Now, he is only known for dominating the south with his acting. What a pity! Those who study him cannot reach his level of refinement in acting, and only imitate his hoarse voice in singing. It is like buying the box and returning the pearl, abandoning the spirit and taking the appearance. They are truly confused.
