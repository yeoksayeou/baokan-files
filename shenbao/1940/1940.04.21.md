### Foreigners' Views on the Reopening of Navigation on the Pearl River

Guangzhou. Regarding the reopening of navigation on the Pearl River today, the Guangzhou Foreign Chamber of Commerce recently issued a statement saying that this move seems to be a step in the right direction. However, after studying the detailed procedures for ship movement and cargo entry and exit, as well as the list of prohibited items, an accurate decision can be made on the value of this step. If these regulations and restrictions hinder the free movement of goods that could be obtained under the customs administration, the reopening of the Pearl River will be of little value to trade and navigation. It is incomprehensible why merchants must first apply to the Customs Supervisor for a permit before applying to the Customs Commissioner. This approach contradicts the established procedures for applying to transport goods and cannot be taken lightly. Furthermore, this move will increase unnecessary procedures and costs for merchants, causing frustrating delays. It should be understood that Guangzhou is a distribution center for goods entering and exiting, and the surrounding areas are mostly production and consumption areas. If the free movement of goods in the surrounding areas is restricted, there is no hope of restoring trade. The return of Whampoa and other ports in the Pearl River Delta to customs administration is also absolutely necessary for the normal operation of trade. (20th Reuters Dispatch)

Tokyo. The Pearl River was opened today, allowing foreign general trade to pass through, as announced in the joint communiqué issued by the Japanese naval and land forces in Southern China on the 12th of this month. According to the communiqué, "The Japanese land forces in Southern China will, from April 20th, allow general trade to pass through to Guangzhou within the scope that does not hinder military operations."

Editorial

### The Focus of the Pacific Problem

In the past week, those who have paid attention to the Pacific problem have placed their emphasis on the crisis in the Dutch East Indies. On the 15th of this month, Japanese Foreign Minister Arita declared after a special cabinet meeting that he expressed concern about any situation that could change the status of the Dutch East Indies. There are only two things in his heart; One is to comfort the depressed morale of the people in the country, showing that Japan still has the ambition and spare power to actively develop abroad; The second is to use this to measure the repercussions abroad - especially to spy on the reaction of the United States as a reference for promoting the Southern Advance strategy. US Secretary of State Hull adopted a solemn attitude and issued a lion's roar, issuing a statement on the 17th, saying: Any change in the status quo of the Dutch East Indies will damage the peace and security of the Pacific, which is not allowed by the treaty and is not allowed by the United States. With the strong national power of the United States as the backing of Mr. Hull's statement, Japan will inevitably have to retreat temporarily. Judging from the surface, the crisis in the Dutch East Indies will come to an end for the time being. However, the international situation is urgent, and Japan's desire for aggression is endless. If we say that the Pacific has been turned into a safe haven because of Mr. Hull's words, the problem is not so simple, and the situation is not so optimistic.

Japan today has not yet shown weakness in the international community and has not yet reduced its aggressive arrogance. What it relies on is nothing more than the navy. According to the latest survey, the comparison of the strength of the three major naval powers, Britain, the United States, and Japan, is as follows: The British fleet has a total of more than 2,050,000 tons of ships of all classes, of which those under construction account for slightly less than 720,000 tons; The US fleet has a total of about 1,750,000 tons, of which those under construction account for more than 470,000 tons; The Japanese fleet has a total of more than 1,007,000 tons, of which those under construction account for more than 260,000 tons. The British Navy is now concentrating all its efforts to cope with the European war, and the only ones competing in the Pacific are the United States and Japan. From a numerical point of view, the total tonnage of the US and Japanese navies is in a ratio of five to three; However, in terms of strength, although the United States has ten main battle ships, most of Japan's warships of all classes are new types, which is inevitable; Therefore, the strength of the five-to-three ratio is doubtful, but it cannot be concluded that Japan's navy is enough to overwhelm the United States in the Western Pacific, or that the US navy is no match for Japan. Modern warfare is a war of comprehensive national strength. The outcome depends not only on the level of military power, but also on the strength of the entire national strength, especially economic strength. Since Japan launched a full-scale war of aggression against China, it has been thirty-four months. The consumption of its military expenditure should not be less than 1.5 million yuan, and the casualties of its troops should not be less than one million people; And China's heroic resistance is now actively expanding. The so-called "China Incident" is a chronic disease in Japan. Is there any spare power to cope with the US-Japanese war? The United States, on the other hand, has the world's leading economic strength; Recently, the 963,000,000 USD Vincent supplementary shipbuilding bill has also been approved by the House of Representatives, and it is certain that it will be passed by the Senate; The plan to defend Guam has also been re-submitted to Congress by Chief of Naval Operations Stark. All of this is what Japan is jealous of and afraid of, but it has nothing to complain about. Limited by objective conditions, it is not able to win. Moreover, more than half of Japan's military supplies and resources depend on the United States; According to a survey by US Secretary of Commerce Hopkins, the United States supplies Japan with 56% of its heavy industry necessities, 40% of raw cotton, 40% of metals, 50% of machinery, and 65% of oil. Therefore, the implementation of economic sanctions by the United States is enough to control Japan's fate, and it can be seen that Japan's outward strength is empty.

Japan's national strength is so weak, but its ambition for aggression is endless. What we can say for sure is that as long as the aggressive ambition of the Japanese warlords exists, there will be no peace in the Pacific, and the history of the Far East for the past fifty years, which is full of blood and tears, is clear evidence of this. Japan's aggressive goals are to the north, from Korea to Manchuria, from Manchuria to Mongolia, and from Mongolia to all of China; To the south, from Ryukyu to Taiwan, from Taiwan to Hainan Island, and now it will go further and covet the Dutch East Indies. On February 11th last year, the day after the Japanese army invaded Hainan Island, President Chiang Kai-shek issued a speech, saying: "There are three most important strategic bases in the Pacific, Sakhalin Island in the north, Hainan Island in the west, and Guam in the east. … And it has been painstakingly trying to create a communication line between these three bases for more than 30 years." Then, Japan's coveting of the Dutch East Indies cannot be interpreted as an attempt to cut off the British-American connection, prepare to further seize Guam and the Philippines, take the lead, and control the United States; This is indeed the focus of the entire Pacific problem. The Japanese are taciturn, greedy, and resentful. They will not turn back until they are in a desperate situation, and the gradual decline of their national strength is enough to make their desire for progress and urgency even more acute. Haven't you heard what is said by the authoritative magazine "Diplomatic Times" and other magazines and newspapers? Their arrangements in Nanjing and the visit of the Abe mission to China are to control China and exclude Britain and the United States. In short, they can symbolize the Japanese warlords' continued aggressive invasion of the mainland. And what Foreign Minister Arita declared can be regarded as a sign that the Japanese warlords will launch a fierce offensive against the Pacific. It is unwise to raise a tiger and cause trouble. Judging from the recent expressions of the US authorities, their strength and perseverance have exceeded the norm, and they seem to have realized that it is not advisable to be lenient; However, if we say that this expression alone, without taking concrete actions, can stop the aggressor's ambition and eliminate the major problems in the Pacific, then the Japanese are not like that.

### Edison Declares that the US Navy is Prepared to Cope with Any War; Hawaii Becomes a Strong Outpost; A Decision to Curb Attempts to Disrupt the South Seas

Nashville Ship. US Secretary of the Navy Edison declared last night that the US fleet is now prepared to act in any part of the world. Mr. Edison arrived at Maar Island after inspecting the Pacific naval exercises in Hawaii last week. When it comes to the Dutch East Indies issue, he said, "With the current strength of our navy, we are prepared to operate in any location in accordance with our national policy." He built a "very strong outpost" with the command and authority given by the Navy Department. He will ask Congress to increase the budget for kerosene and munitions to expand the scope of the current Pacific exercises. (20th United Press Dispatch)

Washington. US Navy Chief of Construction Robinson asked the Senate Naval Committee today to allow the Navy Department to sign contracts to build warships before Congress approves the appropriations bill, and to increase funding to increase the tonnage of the US Navy by 11%. (20th Huitong News Agency Dispatch)

Washington. The "New York Daily News" stated yesterday that the government's policy toward the Far East, especially the Dutch East Indies issue, will "include the seeds of a possible US-Japanese war." The newspaper intervened in the US government's policy of maintaining the status quo in the South Seas, saying, "If this is the State Department's policy on the East Indies, and Congress supports it, then we have no reason to object. Regardless of whether our country is right or wrong in war or possible war, this policy undoubtedly includes the seeds of a possible US-Japanese war. Once the Netherlands is invaded, Japan will definitely prepare to quickly seize the East Indies with its navy, and the United States will then feel the threat of war everywhere, and the fire may also involve the Philippines." Recently, it is believed in Congress that the US-Japanese commercial relationship and the long-pending embargo plan will be the weapons of the United States to respond to Japan's invasion of the Dutch East Indies. People in the State Department believe that these measures by the United States are enough to curb any attempt to disrupt the status quo in the South Seas. (20th United Press Dispatch)

Rome. The "Italian People's Daily" implied yesterday that the US fleet's exercises in the Pacific were for the US fleet to seize the Dutch East Indies in the event that the Netherlands was drawn into the vortex of the European war. When commenting on Japanese Foreign Minister Hachiro Arita's statement that Japan would not allow other countries to occupy the East Indies, the newspaper claimed that the Hague government hurriedly assured Japan that this assumption was impossible. But how can the Dutch government know the future, and the US main battle ships are currently sailing to the Pacific. (20th United Press Dispatch)

London. According to special news from here, the US Baltimore Sun discussed the Dutch East Indies issue, stating the importance of its exports such as rubber, tin, and oil, saying that the United States, in view of the needs of national defense, will definitely recognize any change in the current situation in the Dutch East Indies as a major event that is closely related to the United States. (20th Reuters Dispatch)

### US Aircraft Production Increases to 25,000 per Year

Washington. US Navy Bureau of Aeronautics Director Rear Admiral Towers told the Senate Naval Committee yesterday that since the outbreak of the European War, foreign countries, especially Britain and France, have ordered 7,000 aircraft from the United States, of which 3,000 have already been exported to foreign countries. By the end of this year, the number of aircraft produced in the United States will increase to 25,000 per year. He predicted that the final production speed of aircraft is 750 per hour. (20th United Press Dispatch)

Washington. The amount of war materials exported by the United States to Britain and France in March fell sharply, probably because Britain and France temporarily stopped purchasing to wait for the United States to approve their purchase of new types of aircraft. According to statistics released today, the value of war material export licenses obtained by France in March was only 500,000 yuan. However, the amount obtained by the British Autonomous Territory was very large, especially in Canada, valued at 15,750,000 yuan, almost all of which were aircraft. Australia purchased 1,600,000 yuan, and New Zealand approximately 2,000,000 yuan. The war materials actually exported by the United States in March totaled 17,500,000 yuan, of which those exported to Norway were valued at 1,000,000 yuan, mostly aircraft. In total, in the first three months of this year, the United States exported war materials worth 61,000,000 yuan. (20th Reuters Dispatch)

### Philippine Immigration Law is Inevitable; Congressmen Reject Japanese Protest

Manila. Members of the Philippine Congress today rejected Japan's protest against the immigration bill to be adopted in the Philippines. The bill restricts the immigration of China and Japan to the Philippines to 500 people per year. A spokesman for the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said yesterday that this bill is a discriminatory expression against Japan. Congressman Esgairel said, "This bill is inevitable. Japan seems to have a tendency to interfere in the interests of the Philippines." After passing three readings and being approved by President Quezon and President Roosevelt, this immigration bill can become law. Political circles say that approval is not a problem. Japanese immigration to the Philippines will be reduced by about 70% per year. (20th United Press Dispatch)

### Japanese Prime Minister Yonai Admits Difficulties in Handling China; Disbelieves Allied Powers Will Rashly Enter War; U.S. Naval Maneuvers are Routine

Tokyo - Japanese Prime Minister Yonai, in a review of the global situation to Japanese journalists, stated that in the past few days, there has been talk of Italy joining the European war. However, the relationship between Germany, the Soviet Union, and Italy is very complex and subtle, and he does not believe Italy will act rashly. The United States is paying close attention to the gains and losses of U.S. involvement in the war. However, we should not make a rash judgment as to whether the United States will enter the war. Foreign Minister Arita's remarks regarding the Dutch East Indies are merely an expression of Japan's concerns. Japan has a mission to prevent the spread of the European war to the East. Ethically speaking, it is right and honorable for us to express this attitude. The U.S. Navy customarily holds exercises around April each year, and this year it will proceed as usual. There is nothing more to it. We do not need to believe the large-scale U.S. naval maneuvers have any connection to the establishment of the "new Chinese regime." The United States may intend to use this exercise for political purposes, but even so, the Japanese Navy does not feel threatened. Japan's position is one of non-threat and non-aggression. The war Japan is currently engaged in is no less than the war between England and Germany. However, the Japanese people still seem to lack the necessary spirit to cope with various hardships. The Japanese people have never had the experience of a long-term war, nor have they undergone the severe hardships experienced by European countries. Therefore, there is a phenomenon of difficulty in coping with the war situation. However, observing the current European war, the international situation is constantly changing. Therefore, in today's urgent situation, the Japanese people must have the determination and preparation to cope with any hardship. For this reason, the government must strengthen its policies, and all political parties should be especially serious in persuading the people to participate in the movement to shoulder the needs of the situation. Japan's current focus is the China Incident. The "new Chinese regime" has just been established and has not yet achieved any notable results. Japan should assist in creating this "new regime" in accordance with its predetermined policy. Chongqing is now making propaganda for a summer offensive. However, the Chinese coast is completely blockaded, and the Chongqing government lacks funds and raw materials. Therefore, there will eventually be a day when it cannot resist the "new regime." We must wait patiently. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)

### Supplementary Report of Chairman Chiang's Closing Remarks at the Fifth Session of the People's Political Council: Developing the Economy and Implementing Constitutional Government are Both Important Measures for Saving the Country

Chongqing - At the closing of the Fifth Session of the People's Political Council, Chairman Chiang personally delivered a closing speech. The main points of its contents were published in various newspapers on April 11th, but they were only outlines. The official record of this closing speech has now been finalized, and a supplementary report is provided below. Vice-Chairman Zhang, fellow councilors, this session of the council is concluding today. This session lasted for ten days. Our councilors have worked diligently day and night. The government has submitted reports to this council, speaking without reservation. Fellow councilors have reviewed the government's implementation of contributions and offered opinions, speaking without reserve. We have been in harmony and cooperation, selfless and impartial. It can be said that this session was more substantial in spirit and more complete in results than the previous four sessions. Moreover, all the proposals of the session were directed at practical matters, with not a single one being empty and difficult to implement. This is the greatest progress of this council, giving great comfort to our fellow countrymen and greatly inspiring the soldiers and civilians of the country. This council is composed of the wise and talented people of the country. It can be said that it represents the public opinion of our national people. The more successful the session is, the stronger our army becomes. The government will fully accept and earnestly implement the review reports and proposals of the session. It is hoped that everyone will urge the people to work together to implement them. Looking back on the establishment of this council, nearly two years have passed. Our contribution to the country is indeed very great. The most important of these is the realization of spiritual unity. Since the establishment of this council, the whole country, from top to bottom, has been able to unite sincerely and truly concentrate will, unify actions, share life and death, and share weal and woe. The opinions of the government and the people have been closely connected. All the wise and talented people of the country can work together with one heart and one mind to fight the war and build the country. Second, the war policy has been implemented. At each session of the council, there has been a solemn expression of support for the major war policy, so that the people of the country have a unified goal, and all countries of the world have a clear understanding. In the past two years, no matter how difficult the war environment has been, the war policy has always been firm and unwavering. The consistent support of this council has had a great force. Third, a model of civil governance has been established. This is the hope that this chair offered at the first session, and we have fully achieved it in the past two years. We have completely abandoned all the shortcomings of past parliaments. Everything is open and public, and there is absolutely no acting emotionally. In China, from the Han and Tang Dynasties to the Song and Ming Dynasties, the biggest bad habit of the scholars and officials was to act on their own emotions, sacrificing the interests of the country and the nation. The Niu-Li faction in the Tang Dynasty, the Luo-Shu faction in the Song Dynasty, and the Donglin Society and Fushe Society in the Ming Dynasty all despised and excluded each other, stubbornly adhered to their prejudices, and disregarded the interests of the country and the nation. As a result, the will and strength could not be concentrated, and the country and the nation were in turmoil and danger. However, our current situation is completely different. As long as we mention the country, the nation, and the war, all individual or minority opinions can be completely resolved, and we can understand each other and seek reasonable solutions. This fully proves that the Chinese nation has become a modern and progressive nation. Moreover, I believe that China's progress has been as rapid as in recent years, and its future position in the world will surely surpass others. Today, as chairman, I review our past achievements, and I feel infinite glory. I am also convinced that this is a symbol of the bright future of our nation. Comprehensively observing, many cases were resolved in this session, and the entire focus was concentrated on three major points: first, to condemn the Japanese puppets; second, to develop the economy; and third, to implement constitutional government. These are all important measures for us at present, and they are also issues of concern to the people of the country. Now, this chair will describe and explain them one by one. First, condemn the Japanese puppets. On the second day of this session, the entire audience unanimously passed and issued a telegram denouncing the puppet organization. This is the most solemn expression of the public opinion of our entire nation. This clearly declares the firm determination of all Chinese people with blood and intelligence. This point is extremely important to the future of our war. Looking at the history of China in the past, whenever the country encountered foreign aggression and was in great difficulty, the most important thing was to make clear right and wrong and to distinguish between evil and righteousness. We are not afraid of the weakness of the country, nor are we afraid of the seriousness of foreign troubles. We are only afraid of the confusion of evil and righteousness and the obscurity of right and wrong. The dynasties that fell were not only because the scholars and officials competed for emotions and harmed the public for private interests, or lost all sense of shame and did not value integrity, but also because the general society was also confused about evil and righteousness, and did not distinguish between black and white, so that people's minds were numb and unknowingly fell into destruction. Everyone can read the History of the Song Dynasty. When the Jin soldiers crossed the Yellow River and invaded the south, they once said (there is really no one in the Southern Dynasty). We still feel pain, anger, and shame when we read this sentence today. At that time, the population of the Southern Song Dynasty after the southward crossing, although there are no accurate statistics now, was at least over 100 million people. The reason why the Jin people said that there was no one in the Southern Dynasty was because the national integrity was declining and the sense of shame was lost. Traitors such as Zhang Bangchang and Qin Hui only knew how to surrender to the enemy to seek peace, and did not know how to resist the war to seek survival. Therefore, people did not become people, and the country did not become a country. Therefore, even the very small Jin people dared to invade our dignified China, and even be defeated by him. From this, we can know that the most important thing in our current war is to promote national integrity, clarify the meaning of spring and autumn, and strictly distinguish between Yi and Xia. Now, the puppet organization vainly tries to reverse black and white and confuse people's minds. At this critical juncture, the entire council unanimously denounced it, which is to fulfill the responsibility of clarifying right and wrong and distinguishing between evil and righteousness. This force of righteousness makes the people of the country recognize the significance of loyalty and treachery not being compatible, and the enemy and us not coexisting. Strengthening our determination to resist Japan and eliminate traitors is more powerful than the force of one million troops. As long as the people of the country know that traitors and bandits must be punished, and the dignity of China must be protected, so that righteousness will always exist and justice will be manifested, any violent enemy will never be able to destroy China. Therefore, this solemn denunciation of the council is enough to make the Japanese lose their courage and the traitors lose their souls. But on the Japanese side, the Japanese warlords will never recognize the great spiritual power of the Chinese people today. The Japanese warlords have never recognized the times, nor have they recognized China. They are not only scheming, but also deaf and blind, and only vainly try to destroy China. They only know the history of the late Song and Ming Dynasties of China. They have studied in detail the methods by which the Yuan and Qing Dynasties destroyed the Song and Ming Dynasties, but they have not studied the history of the establishment of the Republic of China before and after. He does not even know how the Qing Dynasty was overthrown, how the Republic of China was established, and how the National Revolutionary Army carried out the Northern Expedition and the War of Resistance. The Japanese warlords have completely ignored and do not understand this most important history. Moreover, he would not think of the Three Principles of the People, the highest principle of China's nation-building, and the great power of the National Revolution for thirty years. Everyone has recently read the newspaper, didn't Japan loudly clamor to send Abe Nobuyuki to be a disguised Governor-General of Korea? Why do they have to put on such an act and make such a fuss? It is because they themselves know that this is completely an act of (covering their ears to steal the bell). Therefore, he especially wants to embellish the show, thinking that it is a plan to deceive himself, but he does not know that he has caused such invasion and humiliation to China, which only intensifies the national consciousness of the Chinese compatriots, enhances the spirit of resistance, and deepens the irreconcilable hatred between China and Japan for generations. China today is not only like the Southern Song Dynasty, which was despised by the enemy as having no one. China is now concentrating the wise and talented people of the country, actively responsible, and unanimously resisting the war. Just talking about the spirit of the councilors today, who are united against the enemy, is enough to show that China not only has people, but also 50 million compatriots, who are all educated by national consciousness. The Three Principles of the People are all the incarnations of Xu Xilin, Wen Shengcai, Li Peiji, and Peng Jiazhen, the martyrs who revived the nation. Whoever wants to destroy China will be destroyed by China first. I can boldly say that China is now completely a believer in the Three Principles of the People, with principles, determination, and plans. China is really not afraid of not having people. Looking back at the situation in Japan today, some people have tasted and said "Japan really has no one". This sentence is not only often said by foreigners, but also by the Japanese themselves who have publicly and unscrupulously said "Japan is really unmanned". But in my opinion, it can only be said that his current politicians have no backbone and no vision. His soldiers have no martial virtue. Just look at him since (September 18), the statement of Konoe Fumimaro (New Order in East Asia) before the year, and even the secret agreement (New Sino-Japanese Relations) signed by Kagesa Sadaki and Wang Jingwei at the end of last year. Until this spring, Abe Nobuyuki was sent to China, vainly trying to relive his old dream of destroying Korea, we can know that Japanese politicians and soldiers are really greedy, cruel, and arrogant, deceiving themselves. They have no brains and no backbone. People without this kind of backbone are in charge of everything, which is tantamount to no one. Everyone, look at Abe's fate, what will be the result in the future? His visit to China this time not only proves that Japan (unmanned), but also fundamentally the entire Japanese country, has completely failed. Therefore, it can be proved that China has completely laid the foundation for its revival through this war of resistance, and the guarantee for the entire liberation of the East Asian nation lies entirely in this.

### Li Hanhun Inspects Eastern Guangdong

Xingning - Guangdong Chairman Li Hanhun, due to the serious rice shortage in Chaozhou and Meizhou, went east on the morning of the 17th with Lu Yougang, a member of the military discipline inspection team, and Huang Yuming, a participant from the provincial government, and a party of more than ten people to inspect the area. That evening, they arrived at Zhongxin Township in Lianping County, where they summoned the local district chief and the director of the tax bureau to inquire in detail.

### Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union Plan to Divide Spheres of Influence in the Balkans; Soviet Ambassador to Germany Returns with a Plan; Frequent Telephone Contacts Between Berlin and Rome

The "Electric News" in The Hague recently reported that Soviet Ambassador to Germany, Shkvartsev, has returned to his post in Berlin after a three-week vacation in his home country. According to well-informed sources, Ambassador Shkvartsev brought with him a note from Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov to German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, explaining the Soviet view on the solution of various issues in the Balkans. Judging from various signs, the three countries of Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union all want to eliminate the influence of Britain and France in the Balkans and divide the spheres of influence there. Generally, Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary are included in the space vital to Germany's survival, Yugoslavia and Greece are controlled by Italy, and Turkey is controlled by the Soviet Union. At this time, the German authorities are optimistic that Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union can reach a concrete agreement, and telephone contacts between Berlin and Rome are becoming more frequent. The contents of the meeting between German Head of State Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini at the Brenner Pass will be revealed soon. (Havas dispatch, 20th)

Rome - Although satisfaction has been expressed here with British Prime Minister Chamberlain's statement on Thursday that Britain wants to maintain peace in the Balkans, responsible political figures have expressed great skepticism about the meeting of British ambassadors to the Balkan countries in London. It is claimed that Italy has prevented the spread of war to the Mediterranean and the Balkans through diplomatic action. Therefore, this part of Europe is not threatened by Germany and Italy. Then, what kind of danger does Britain want to use the plans already studied in the London Church meeting to deal with? It is really incomprehensible. Italy has already explained its position on the Balkans, the Danube River, and the Mediterranean region, and will now decide to defend it against any sudden attack. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)

### Italy Faces a Critical Moment of Decision Between Peace and War; Freedom of Sea Routes Must Be Guaranteed; Unwilling to Be Dominated by Others for Long

Rome - A machine newspaper of Prime Minister Mussolini is titled, "Critical Moment of Decision," advocating that "the Italian people must take action." "The Italian People's News" recently published an article stating, "The Italian nation is now at a historical crossroads, and its position is in the center of the war zone. It cannot stand by and watch for long, so as to be caught between two enemies in the future. In other words, a great nation like ours cannot allow others to supervise or control its internal activities. For example, if we want to go from the port of Trieste in our country to the port of Massawa in East Africa, that is, from Italy to Italy, we must be blocked, questioned, checked, and even ordered to stop, which not only violates the dignity of an independent country, but also hinders the transportation of all easily corrosive goods. Ordinary criminal law prohibits arbitrarily checking others in broad daylight. To this day, our country has been deprived of the protection of this ordinary criminal law by others. Under this violent measure, our country may be strangled to death. On the other hand, a great position requires space. All great nations in the world have direct access to the ocean, but only our Italy does not. From this point of view, the freedom enjoyed by our country is not even as good as Portugal. How can it be said to be fair? Prime Minister Mussolini once said that in order to eliminate the fate of our nation as a prisoner of the Mediterranean, we will not hesitate to make special sacrifices. How wonderful is this statement. We deeply know that the bayonet is more important than gold, and we know even more that anyone who is unwilling to take risks or despise life cannot maintain his position. Therefore, we should not resent the iron and blood mission given to us by fate, because there is no construction without destruction." (Havas dispatch, 19th)

Italian Naval and Air Force Power Should Not Be Underestimated

Rome - Military figures here recently said that the air force is in an important position in the Norwegian war. Italy's air force is comparable to the most powerful countries and is not inferior at all. "The Italian People's News," a machine newspaper of Prime Minister Mussolini, also stated that the war situation in the North Sea is of great significance to Italy. From this, it can be seen that the naval power of a country is not based on the total tonnage of the fleet, but should take into account the entire naval and air force and its bases. For this reason, the so-called naval country has ceased to exist and has become a naval and air force country. Italy in the Mediterranean is like a huge aircraft carrier and is a strong naval and air force country. (Havas dispatch, 19th)

Rome - British Minister of Economic Warfare Cross spoke on Wednesday, saying that if Italy wants other countries to treat it as a neutral country, its actions must be within the scope of a neutral country. Gedda, the mouthpiece of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, wrote an article today in response, saying that although Cross's words were declared by the British semi-official spokesperson that there was no reason to attach excessive importance to them, some newspapers in London published this article under intolerable and bizarre titles, stating that Italy does not need to be taught by others how to rectify its behavior, nor can it accept warnings from others. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)

Rome - Italian newspapers continued to criticize Britain and France today. "Fascist System News" stated, "British and French newspapers have been commenting on Italy's attitude for days. In short, what they want is for us to transform the resentment we had when the League of Nations imposed sanctions on our country into love. In other words, they hope that we will love the people who wanted to starve our nation. How is this possible? Forgiveness without knowing the way can easily be mistaken for cowardice or weakness. This is something that will never be done in Fascist Italy. Even from the perspective of national interests, our country does not need to fight alongside the jailers of our enemies. Wouldn't it be better if the French newspapers praised the victory of the Anglo-French Allied Forces? In fact, Germany has achieved absolute success so far, and Italy and Germany have concluded an alliance treaty, which Britain and France must not forget." (Havas dispatch, 19th)

### Hitler's Birthday: German Party, Government, and Military Express Loyalty to the Leader; Key Figures Deliver Radio Speeches Encouraging National Unity to Achieve Victory

Berlin - The official news agency announced that Hitler peacefully spent his 51st birthday with his military and political advisers in the Prime Minister's Office today. No formal celebrations or receptions were held. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)

Switzerland - Today is the 51st birthday of German Head of State Hitler. General Walter von Brauchitsch, Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Admiral Raeder, Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, and General Goering, Minister of Aviation, respectively issued statements declaring that the national army, navy, and air force are loyal to the leader and trust the leader. General Goering also said, "The best gift our air force can present to the leader is to devote all our strength to realizing our goals, even if we go through fire and water, we will not hesitate. This is the case now, and it will be the case in the future." Minister Hess then delivered a speech to the National Socialist Youth League, saying, "Germany can obtain colonies at the end of the war. You, at this moment, cannot fight with weapons due to age, then you can only work for the colonies at that time to develop your talents. In short, the path opened up by Leader Hitler is a brave path. It must be known that Germany is not limited to the space occupied by the current Greater German Reich, but should include all Germans throughout the world." (Havas dispatch, 20th)

Berlin - Today is Hitler's 51st birthday. Minister of Aviation General Goering issued a statement to the people, first mentioning the national contribution of metal objects, and then said that this war will be very difficult, but we will support the leader more because the leader is the first soldier and the first person to serve the country, and he is the model for all of us. We support him and follow him, knowing that Hitler will lead us to victory. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)

Berlin - German Propaganda Minister Goebbels broadcast a speech last night on the eve of Hitler's 51st birthday, saying that the German people may have different opinions on some events, but their respect, love, obedience, and trust in Hitler are unanimous and without the slightest difference. This is the strongest armed force to protect the country in the current war on which Germany's survival depends. We are now facing difficult trials. The new type of war does not rely solely on weapons, but also relies on the economic front and, more importantly, on the front of striving for the national soul. The propaganda of plutocratic Britain against the German people is completely ineffective. The German people will never accept orders, advice, or encouragement from Britain. Now the whole country has gathered its entire strength, and the front line and the domestic front line have been united. No one utters a complaint, and no one utters a doubt. Although we all have our own things to do, our wishes are the same, that is, to wish Hitler a long life and lead us to achieve a glorious German victory. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)

### Prime Minister Reynaud's Report on the Current Situation; House Passes Vote of Confidence

Paris - Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Reynaud attended the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee this morning, immediately answering inquiries from most committee members. He addressed and explained each point regarding (1) Franco-Italian relations, (2) the situation in the Balkan Peninsula and the Near East, (3) the situation in the Far East, (4) France's policy in Northern Europe, (5) France's relations with the Soviet Union, and (6) security guarantees after victory. The committee members listened attentively and expressed satisfaction, with Chairman Bérenger thanking Prime Minister Reynaud on their behalf. (Havas News Agency, 20th)

Paris - The House of Representatives last night unanimously passed a vote of confidence in the government with 504 votes to zero. This motion gives unconditional support to the government and declares that the House approves the government's declaration, trusting the government to continue pursuing its war policy, which the Parliament has consistently supported, until victory. It is noted that the initial vote of approval for the Reynaud government in the House was only one vote more than the opposition, but now it has gained unanimous support from the entire House, so political figures believe that the current government's strength has greatly increased. (Reuters, 20th) Prime Minister Reynaud is scheduled to deliver a speech to the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee today, reporting on the latest developments in the international situation.

### Anglo-Turkish Talks: Exchange of Views on the Balkan Situation

London - The British Foreign Secretary met with the Turkish Ambassador Aras yesterday afternoon. It is widely believed that they exchanged views regarding intelligence on Italy's attitude towards Britain and France. Both British and Turkish officials have remained silent on this discussion, but diplomatic circles consider it particularly important, believing that this discussion may lead Turkey to immediately state its position should Italy take any action in Yugoslavia or the Eastern Mediterranean. Well-informed sources in the Balkans believe that Greece would welcome a strong Turkish army entering Greece to resist any invader of the Balkans. British figures now believe that Italy may not risk launching a major war at this time. It is reported that Britain and Turkey have already planned thoroughly for any possible situation. Knowledgeable Balkan diplomats believe that if Italy attacks Dalmatia, Bulgaria will assist Yugoslavia, and neutral observers also state that if Italy invades Yugoslavia, Turkey will also provide assistance. (United Press, 20th)

London - Political figures here recently stated that German leader Hitler is currently pursuing a policy of expanding the war. Because the group lacks material resources and cannot conduct a long-term war, it intends to invade many parts of Europe in order to plunder various resources. Under these circumstances, Germany may deploy troops to "protect" neighboring countries already in the "most dangerous situation," as it did with Denmark and Norway. Therefore, all small countries are uneasy. As for the Netherlands, taking Norway as a lesson, in addition to strengthening its national defense, it has also taken various preventive measures to cope with the domestic crisis. As for the countries of Southeastern Europe, according to reliable sources, Germany has recently deployed several more divisions near the Hungarian border. There are rumors that the country has also been mobilizing troops on the Yugoslav border, but this is not reliable. Political figures say that if Germany takes any action towards Hungary, Italy will definitely follow, seeking a new sphere of influence. The Italian government seems to be creating public opinion in preparation for abandoning its non-intervention policy in the future. Although the British government recently inquired about Italy's true intentions through diplomatic channels, the results were still difficult to reassure people. Therefore, the British Ambassador to Italy, Loraine, may soon ask the Italian government to clearly state its attitude, and also inform it that if it takes interventionist action against its neighbors, it will cause severe consequences. According to well-informed sources, the greatest threat is currently to Yugoslavia. As for Turkey, regardless of what happens in the Mediterranean, the country will absolutely adhere to the mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and Turkey. In short, Britain continues to implement the same policy towards all threatened small countries, that is, if these countries request protection from Britain and France, it will immediately provide it, but will never force these countries to accept protection.

### Anglo-Soviet Trade Negotiations to Reopen; Britain Must Obtain Soviet Guarantee Not to Export Raw Materials to Germany as a Condition

London - Official sources recently stated that Foreign Secretary Halifax met with Soviet Ambassador Maisky yesterday and immediately informed him that the British government is willing to accept the Soviet proposal and prepare to negotiate the basis for bilateral trade talks. According to well-informed sources, what Britain and the Soviet Union should negotiate is a "wartime trade agreement," the content of which takes into account wartime needs and is generally the same as those concluded by Britain with various neutral countries. (Havas News Agency, 20th)

London - Authoritative sources here last night reported that the British government notified the Soviet Union yesterday that it had, in principle, accepted the Soviet Union's recent request to start Anglo-Soviet trade negotiations. Soviet Ambassador Maisky was invited to visit Foreign Secretary Halifax yesterday, and the Foreign Secretary clearly stated that he must obtain a firm guarantee from the Soviet side regarding trade with Germany, especially regarding Soviet exports to Germany. Informed circles say that Britain is clearly going to discuss with the Soviet Union the transport of important raw materials to the Soviet Union and British-made machinery to the Soviet Union, but the Soviet Union must guarantee that these raw materials are not re-exported to Germany. Neutral parties believe that this move by Britain may loosen the economic bloc between Germany and the Soviet Union. (United Press, 20th)

### U.S. Military Attachés in Europe Hold Meeting; Myers Returns Home After Business

Genoa, Italy - Major General Myers, the new head of the U.S. Army Intelligence Department in Genoa, Italy, held a meeting here today with the military attachés of the U.S. embassies in Italy, Britain, Turkey, Yugoslavia, Romania, and Hungary.

### Former Prime Minister of Yugoslavia Suddenly Arrested; Known for Being Pro-German

Belgrade, Yugoslavia - Former Yugoslav Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Stojadinović was arrested today and will be imprisoned in Rutnik Castle. It is noted that former Prime Minister Stojadinović is a well-known pro-German figure and has always opposed the Soviet Union. This matter may be related to the government's intention to approach the Soviet Union. In addition, the government also searched the residences of most of former Prime Minister Stojadinović's political friends, immediately finding various propaganda materials attacking the current government's internal affairs. (Havas News Agency, 19th)

According to reports, Mr. Stojadinović is known throughout Yugoslavia as the "savior of the Dinar" because when he was Minister of Finance from 1922 to 1926, he not only curbed the decline of the Dinar but also increased its exchange rate against the Swiss Franc, and also stabilized the Dinar during the unprecedented and rapid fluctuations in the currencies of major European countries. (Reuters, 20th)

### British and German Forces Come into Contact Near Trondheim, Norway; German Forces in Northern Norway Cut Off from Rear; Canadian Troops Land Southeast of Hamar

Stockholm, Sweden - British expeditionary forces have made first contact with German troops in the town of Grong, near Trondheim, Norway. In addition, a food panic has broken out in Oslo, which is quite serious, especially with meat being the most scarce. (Havas News Agency, 19th)

Stockholm, Sweden - Military experts here recently stated that British troops landed yesterday at Namsos, north of Trondheim, Norway. This move has a great impact on the war situation, because (1) the German forces in northern Norway have been completely cut off from their rear bases, making development very difficult, and (2) after landing, the British forces should rapidly attack the weaker areas of German defenses. Both of these points are unfavorable to the German forces. (Havas News Agency, 20th)

Berlin - According to news from the border, German forces have occupied Hamar, 99 miles from Oslo, and have reached a point 40 miles north of Kongsvinger. (Reuters, 20th)

London - There is news that Canadian expeditionary forces have landed in Langste Bay, Norway. Informed sources have commented that if this news is proven to be true, then a major battle will occur 160 miles southeast of Hamar. As for the critical situation in western Norway, Allied forces are now in contact with the advance troops of the German forces led by Colonel Weiss (who came to guard Trondheim) in Namsos and Steinkjer. Generally, a major battle will occur in the vicinity of Steinkjer. (Havas News Agency, 20th)

Stockholm, Sweden - According to indirect news here, the situation in the Trondheim area seems to be developing into a battle. The Norwegians in the area have been fully mobilized and armed, and are now concentrated in Steinkjer, 60 miles north of Trondheim, and have made contact with the Allied forces landing in Namsos, Molde, and Rauma (75 miles into the Sogneg Inlet). The Norwegian forces south of Trondheim have also made contact with the Allied forces. German forces are currently setting up defenses around Trondheim, and it is expected that battles will also occur 20 miles south of the city, between Okdal and Kvaal. According to a Reuters military correspondent, Elverum is an important junction for northern transportation. Since the fall of Kongsvinger, German forces have been meeting resistance from Norwegian rear guards who are destroying bridges and laying mines along the way with every inch of advance. When German forces tried to cross the Glomma River, Norwegian guerrillas destroyed the gates upstream, flooding the German forces. 120 German soldiers were lost. If the report that Canadian troops landed at the mouth of Langste Bay, 160 miles southeast of Hamar, is confirmed, then a fierce battle is expected to occur rapidly in that area. The strength of the Allied forces in Norway has not yet been confirmed. One report says that there are about 50,000 troops in total, including two British divisions and one French division. The first German troops to land in the Trondheim area numbered 1,200, and later about 2,000 more arrived by plane. However, their numbers are relatively weak, and they are expected to fight a defensive battle. It is heard that German troops along the railway have been recalled, and it is also expected that German forces will send small teams to launch surprise attacks to prevent Allied forces from advancing south from Namsos. It is heard that 400 German soldiers who landed on thick ice six miles east of Namsos have already engaged in combat with the Allied forces, and fresh troops have arrived. Refugees fleeing from Narvik often arrive here exhausted after traveling on snowshoes. According to them, men and women leaving Narvik are prohibited. Occasionally, fishing boats sail to the Ofotfjord and there is artillery fire, but coastal residents there have not seen it. (Reuters, 20th)

### German Planes Attack British Convoy Off Norwegian Coast; Three Ships Hit and Heavily Damaged; London Gazette Says Not True

Berlin - According to official announcements, German air forces attacked a British convoy yesterday off the west coast of Norway, hitting two transport ships and one cruiser. The transport ship sailors jumped into the sea, swam several kilometers to the coast, and then boarded lifeboats. The cruiser was heavily damaged and emitted thick smoke. There was gasoline floating on the nearby sea surface, but the anti-aircraft fire was very heavy, and German planes could not confirm whether the ships had sunk. (Haitong News Agency, 20th)

London - A joint announcement by the Navy and Army stated that the German claim that a British transport ship was sunk by bombs off the coast of Norway yesterday is purely fabricated. (Reuters, 10th)

Amsterdam - According to an official announcement by the British Admiralty, the destroyer "Hunter" sank when Britain participated in the first Battle of Narvik.

### Yugoslav Delegation to Go to Moscow Today; To Promote Trade Relations Between the Two Countries; This Trip Is Not Political in Nature

Belgrade, Yugoslavia - A Yugoslav economic delegation, led by former Minister of Finance Djordjević, is scheduled to depart tomorrow night via Bucharest, Romania, for Moscow to conduct trade talks with Soviet authorities. It is heard that its mission is limited to discussing the general principles of promoting trade between the two countries. (Havas News Agency, 20th)

Moscow - At the end of March 1940, the Yugoslav government suggested to the Soviet government establishing economic relations between the two countries and starting negotiations on the following issues: (1) concluding a trade agreement, (2) clearing accounts, and (3) establishing trade agencies in the capitals of both countries. The Soviet government has accepted the suggestion and authorized the Chairman of the People's Commissariat for Foreign Trade to handle the issue. The Yugoslav economic delegation will arrive here within days to conduct negotiations with the Soviet side. It is heard that the head of the delegation is Djordjević, president of the Belgrade Bank, and the deputy head is Obradović, director of trade. (TASS, 20th)

Moscow - Recent foreign newspapers have rumored that the Soviet government will conduct political negotiations with the Yugoslav delegation in order to strengthen its neighborly relations.

### Netherlands and Belgium Are Strictly Prepared; Clamp Down on Activities of Foreign Residents; Control of Domestic Front

The Hague - The Netherlands National Socialist "Comrades of Duty" Association originally planned to hold 59 public rallies throughout the Netherlands this month, but has now been canceled due to the government's declaration of a state of national emergency. It is heard that the Dutch government's recent actions have severely cracked down on the conspiracies of National Socialists. The military authorities are now implementing measures they deem appropriate for foreigners. It is expected that the authorities will not ban the party unless they discover harmful activities by the National Socialist Party. Signs of the Dutch authorities strengthening control of the domestic front have become increasingly apparent this week. They have banned two speeches by the leader of the Dutch National Socialist Party within three days, but the second ban was slightly relaxed. Police searched the castle of Count Pugh, a National Socialist member of the Lower House, for three hours yesterday. The police will likely continue to search other houses in the future. Border checks of foreign identity documents have not been relaxed, and those with slightly suspicious appearances are not allowed to enter the country. (Reuters, 20th)

Troops have also been dispatched to defend key locations. Pierlot also reiterated the recent statement by Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak that Belgium will definitely defend itself if attacked.

### Details of German Invasion of Norway; Senior Norwegian Official Arrives in Britain to Talk

London - A senior official of the Norwegian government arrived here this month after many transfers to reveal the details of the country's invasion by Germany and the current situation of resistance. (The details discussed should be included in the Norwegian government's White Paper.) It shows that Germany had carefully prepared for a long time before carrying out the invasion. It is said that he witnessed the German fleet forcing Norwegian fishing boats and cargo ships to lead the way into Trondheim Harbor. The Norwegian batteries were unable to fire because they feared injuring the innocent, and because it was dawn and the line of sight was not clear, it was difficult to aim. Some parties accused several officers of the batteries of treason, but in fact, it is difficult to judge before the country is completely liberated and thoroughly investigated. At this moment, the legitimate government has moved to a safe location and completely controls the free zone. Mobilization in the free zone is proceeding as usual. King Haakon VII was repeatedly attacked by German planes in Hamar, Elverum, and Nybergsund, and he also witnessed it. Now the king has moved to a safe location, the specific name of which cannot be disclosed. As for the former puppet government of Quisling and the newly established administrative committee in the occupied area, they are all nominal. The chairman of the committee, Christianson, and the members initially refused to organize a puppet regime under German supervision, and two members of the Quisling government mistakenly believed it to be the legitimate government, so they cooperated with Quisling. They immediately resigned upon learning the truth. (Havas News Agency, 20th)

London - According to an announcement from the Ministry of Supply, an explosion occurred at a munitions factory in northern London today, killing five people and seriously injuring several others.

Ambulances quickly arrived at the factory to rescue the injured and dead, and relatives of people in the factory gathered outside the factory to inquire. According to someone working near the explosion site, "I saw a large cluster of gray smoke that looked like a balloon, gradually descending and shrinking, covering the factory grounds. The tremor of the explosion was quite terrifying." (Reuters, 20th)

### Soviet-Japanese Trade Talks Reopen; Japanese Newspaper Says Soviet Union Willing to Compromise; TASS Instructed to Deny

### Trend of Roosevelt's Re-election as US President

The two major parties in the United States, the Democratic and Republican parties, have been actively holding primaries in various states to select candidates for the next presidential election. Within the Democratic Party, there seems to be a tendency to nominate Roosevelt for a third term. This movement can only be stopped if President Roosevelt himself says "no." However, Democratic Party officials believe that President Roosevelt will not express his approval or disapproval for several weeks and will not suppress this movement at this time. Therefore, the party has already drafted an election campaign plan and intends to request Roosevelt's consent when the party's national committee meets on July 15th.

The first step is to hold a presidential primary in New Hampshire on March 12th to generate a delegation that supports Roosevelt and to promote the campaign. Then, on April 2nd, a presidential primary will be held in Wisconsin to obtain the support of the Progressive Party, which supports Roosevelt, and defeat Vice President Garner, who has joined the race. A week later, the Democratic Party in Illinois will hold a primary. Because the powerful groups led by Kelley and Nash, as well as Governor Horner, are enthusiastically supporting Roosevelt's re-election for a third term. After the results of the Wisconsin and Illinois primaries are revealed, Vice President Garner will know when to withdraw. Primaries in Oregon and California are scheduled for May. Party officials in both states also support Roosevelt's re-election for a third term. After the results of the primaries in these states are revealed, those who want to promote Senator Wheeler as a candidate in the western states can abandon all intentions of campaigning in the West.

The officials who support Roosevelt's re-election for a third term also plan to unite many delegations appointed by the Democratic Party conventions and Democratic Party executive committees in various states to strengthen their momentum. They believe this will be easy to accomplish because most of the officials in various states are already in the third-term movement camp. No one doubts this prediction. With the election campaign in this situation, only Roosevelt's definite statement that he does not want to run again can stop this movement. However, even so, the so-called third-term movement faction can still carry out its planned activities or overcome this difficulty.

Roosevelt is not expected to comment on the election issue for the time being, and there are several events that support this belief. The most important of these is that Roosevelt has remained silent about the primary situation in Illinois. His name has been used as a candidate in the state's primary list. He has neither publicly approved it nor asked for it to be removed. Why Roosevelt allows his name to remain on the ballot is intriguing. Some say that Roosevelt himself is actively campaigning in secret, or that Roosevelt is consolidating his power and, when the time is right, will recommend someone as a presidential candidate to concentrate his power and promote their election.

Another theory is that Roosevelt's dispatch of Secretary of State Welles to Europe is to reserve room for maneuver. He will only be able to express his real opinion on the question of whether he is willing to run for a third term after reviewing Welles' report. The issue of war and peace in Europe is inextricably linked to American politics. President Wilson knew this when he ran in 1916, and President Roosevelt is no outsider. He once revealed in a casual conversation at the White House that although he does not seek to cling to power for four more years, if the European war intensifies, he has an undeniable responsibility to continue in office to keep the United States from being drawn into the whirlpool. Lindley also quoted Roosevelt's remarks in his biography of Roosevelt, saying, "I am a little tired and don't want to run again. It is time for someone else to take over. But if the German army defeats Britain and threatens the United States with the momentum of victory, I cannot promise to leave office." From this, one can think about who the next president of the United States will be. (Translated from New York Times, New York Herald Tribune)

Education News

### Fujian Province Mobilizes Intellectuals to Assist in Handling Public Education, Pilot Programs to be Conducted in Yong'an County

(Yong'an Correspondence) The Fujian Department of Education recently received an order from the Ministry of Education to implement temporary measures for mobilizing intellectuals nationwide to handle public education. Considering that the province has been lacking teachers to promote national education, it would be greatly beneficial to mobilize intellectuals to assist in handling it. After drafting six supplementary measures, they were approved by the Provincial Government Committee and decided to first conduct pilot programs in Yong'an County and other counties, and then promote them universally after achieving results. The measures are extracted below: (1) Each county district should have an overall plan for mobilizing intellectuals to handle public education, so that the result of the mobilization can compensate for the shortage of local teachers. (2) Before the mobilization, a survey of the intellectuals in each county district should be conducted and statistics compiled in preparation for conscription. (3) Intellectuals in each county district who are already serving in national schools and central schools are not subject to conscription. (4) All intellectuals who are to be conscripted should be assigned to adult classes or women's classes in nearby national schools and central schools to teach. (5) Counties and districts with a large number of national schools and sufficient teachers may allow a portion of the conscripted intellectuals (county government or district office staff) to serve as supervisors. (6) For the convenience of teaching and to supplement the current lack of investigation, the service time of the conscripted intellectuals (at least 156 hours per year) may be concentrated within six months, so that they can specialize in teaching one term at one school.

### Current Situation of Secondary Education in Sichuan Province Reported by Provincial Inspector Zhang Dengshou

(Chengdu Airmail) Provincial Inspector Zhang Dengshou reported on secondary education in Sichuan Province, as follows: (1) The secondary education in Sichuan is progressive in terms of quantity. The funding in 1939 increased by 48% compared to 1935, the number of classes increased by 100%, and the number of students increased by 211%. Currently, there is funding of 5,144,738 yuan, 309 schools, 1,874 classes, and 100,977 students. However, in terms of the distribution of quantity, the distribution of secondary, vocational, and normal schools is unbalanced, and the distribution is not very even. (2) The strengths of secondary schools are that teachers have a strong sense of respecting teachers and valuing education, and they can work hard despite meager treatment. Students are able to endure hardship and are extremely simple in nature. In terms of school administration, some schools have strict organization and planning. (3) The shortcomings of secondary schools are that some teachers have not yet been certified as qualified, and some lack a good service spirit. Some students have a poor foundation and have poor living habits. In terms of school administration, there are no proper methods for making finances public, and many new and old principals have failed to handle the handover seriously. In terms of education, the teaching progress has not been carried out according to standards, and there are many areas in teaching that need to be studied and improved. In terms of training, physical punishment has not been completely abolished, the tutor system has not been fully implemented, and students do not have a definite organization for self-government. (4) The urgent problems to be solved in secondary education in the future are to adjust distribution and allocation, increase funding, increase compensation, enrich equipment, cultivate teachers, carefully enroll students, improve teaching, and strictly train students. In the future, normal schools and vocational schools should be established as much as possible to shift the social trend of people favoring general secondary schools.

The seeded player in this group was Zhang Ying, the runner-up of the previous tournament. After Zhang improved his rubber racket, his chops became more powerful. He first defeated Liang Huacheng, then Chen Xuelin, showing his prowess. Zhou Weixin, a veteran nicknamed "Red Nose," was trapped in a fierce battle with the newcomer Li Zhen, who was good at chopping, in the semi-finals. The two fought fiercely for five rounds, and Zhou narrowly defeated Li Zhen 3-2 and reached the final with Zhang Ying. Zhou was very experienced, but before the battle, he had a fear of Zhang. He once took the lead with 11-1 in the first game, but could not get another point, losing the chance to win. His spirit was greatly frustrated. After a fierce battle with Li Zhen, he had no strength to pull the ball and was physically exhausted. Zhang defeated him with three straight sets.

### Weekend Floating Profits Dwindle, Gold Market Continues to Weaken, Falling Below the 5,800 Yuan Level

Yesterday's spot gold market was dull, with few bright spots. Prices were generally weak, and the instability of the trend made ordinary operators wary, making it difficult to determine direction. Both bulls and bears awaited a clearer market outlook, and dared not act rashly. The morning started high, with an opening price of 5,810 yuan, but due to the selling pressure from gold shops and a lack of buyers due to the weekend, the price quickly fell back after a brief hold. Later, currency exchange firms and securities houses bought in, pushing the price up again, but it only struggled around the 5,815 yuan level. Soon after, many floating longs, due to urgent silver needs, rushed to sell at limit prices. Securities houses attempted to absorb these sales, but ultimately found it unsustainable, and the price fell below the 5,800 yuan mark to 5,780 yuan. Later, currency exchange businesses and gold shops saw the low price and stepped in to buy, pushing the price back to the 5,800 yuan level. However, as the closing time approached, buyers disappeared, and currency exchange businesses suddenly resumed selling, resulting in a final price of 5,790 yuan, down 16 yuan from the previous evening's closing price. There was no trading in the afternoon due to the weekend, and little activity was heard of outside the market. The turnover for the day was meager, approximately 1,700 taels. Gold ornaments at silver shops remained unchanged, and customs gold remained stable.

Spot Gold Down 16 Yuan

From the morning, the initial opening price per bar (ten taels) was encouraging. One silver firm showed strong buying interest, pushing the opening price up slightly by 4 yuan. Silver firms, currency exchange businesses, and others bought several dozen taels at 5,810 yuan. Subsequently, gold shops, currency exchange businesses, and others sold off, and the silver firm stopped buying, causing the price to fall back 8 yuan. Gold shops sold ten taels to securities houses at 5,802 yuan. Later, securities houses bought vigorously, and a currency exchange business also competed to buy, creating a strong upward trend, with the price rising again by 13 yuan. Currency exchange businesses sold thirty taels to silver firms at 5,815 yuan. However, buyers gradually decreased, and floating longs saw an opportunity to sell, causing the price to fall again. Shortly after, silver firms, currency exchange businesses, and others competed to sell, causing the price to retreat below the 5,800 yuan mark. Silver firms sold twenty taels to securities houses, but only at 5,780 yuan. Afterward, both buying and selling decreased, and the market was relatively quiet for a time. Around 11 o'clock, buying picked up suddenly. Gold shops repeatedly bought, and currency exchange businesses followed suit, causing the situation to become tense. The price returned to the 5,800 yuan mark. Silver firms traded thirty taels with each other at 5,808 yuan. Unexpectedly, after 11:30, floating longs saw an opportunity to sell again, and currency exchange businesses also shifted to selling, causing the price to fall back below the 5,800 yuan mark again. Silver firms sold several dozen taels to gold shops at 5,790 yuan, as the closing price for the morning session. As a result, the price was down 16 yuan from the previous day. The price fluctuated by 35 yuan during the morning session. The selling price of spot gold by gold shops was several yuan higher than the spot price, while the buying price was 20 yuan lower. The current premium for gold certificates was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed price, and trading was minimal.

Price of Gold Ornaments Unchanged

The selling price of gold ornaments at silver shops remained unchanged. Da Tong Hang continued to offer the original price of 585 yuan per tael. The new firms had the same selling price, but the buying price was reduced by about 15 yuan.

### Foreign Currency Market Increasingly Quiet

Yesterday, the foreign currency market was even more quiet, mainly due to tight credit conditions and the weekend, leading to a wait-and-see attitude. The trend for British and American gold continued to be weak, with market prices falling by 5 jiao each. British gold notes fell back by 1 jiao, while American gold notes remained fluctuating within a narrow range, with the evening price still at 16.55 yuan. Hong Kong notes and French franc notes saw little change. Canadian notes showed a weak trend, with the price falling by 5 fen. Japanese gold notes fell and then recovered to their original level, with the evening price still at 1.305 yuan. Korean notes were in ample supply, and the market price continued to decline, with the evening price at 1.025 yuan. The rest remained unchanged.

The overnight lending rate of the Money Dealers Association remained at 2 jiao for both the morning and afternoon sessions, it was said.

### Securities Market Tight Credit, Domestic Bonds Sold Off

The securities gray market experienced a worsening decline yesterday, with various factions selling off. The underlying cause was the pressure from extraordinarily tight credit conditions. Many were forced to sell to raise cash for working capital, in order to maintain their operations, leading to a gradual decline in market prices. Moreover, due to the end of the quarter, financial institutions mostly only took money in and didn't lend it out. Therefore, it was difficult for the market to improve this month. The high interest rates and the flight of capital made it even harder for the financial sector to operate. Unfavorable rumors regarding Abe and others arriving in Shanghai further dampened sentiment. The eagerness of sellers was particularly evident with the Lianhe bonds, which were sold throughout the day. Others, such as Da Lian, Cheng Da, Tong De, Fu Shun, Yong Yuan, Lian Yi, Tian Feng, Tian Sheng, and Thirty-Eight, also liquidated their holdings along with the market. Hong Da bought in briefly, but quickly sold again. Run He and Ren Chang covered their short positions slightly. No. 20 had some strength to buy E bonds, but still broke the 50 yuan mark. A and C bonds also both broke the 9 yuan mark, falling another 4 to 5.5 jiao. There was no trading in D bonds in the afternoon, so there was no price movement. The total turnover was estimated at around 800,000 to 900,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:

Category High Low Closing Change from Previous Day

Unified A 59.40 58.95 58.90 Down 0.55

Unified B 51.00 50.55 50.50 Down 0.50

### Grains: 40,000 Bags of Changshu and Wuxi Japonica Rice Arrive in Shanghai, Glut of Glutinous Rice Due to Poor Sales Channels

Regarding domestic rice supplies, the Da Chang Company has procured 40,000 bags of japonica rice from Changzhou, Wuxi, and other areas in the interior, which have been arriving in Shanghai in succession, stored in warehouses one and two, and shipped in batches. It is reported that further procurement has not yet continued, but someone is still procuring in Wuxi. As for the thin rice from Qingpu, Sijing, and other areas, as well as the early and late rice from Nangang, 600 to 700 bags arrive daily, mostly transported by small riverboats, first reaching Hongkou, and then transferred to various storage facilities and banks such as Mao Tai. Glutinous rice, which is not subject to restrictions, continues to circulate as usual, so its arrivals are particularly large. However, the main destination in the past, the Shaoshi area of Zhejiang Province, where it was used in distilleries, is now hindered by transportation difficulties, making it difficult to transport and sell, causing glutinous rice to accumulate in Shanghai, creating an unusual glutinous rice glut. As a result, the price of glutinous rice has fallen repeatedly, becoming comparable to broken rice, and cheaper than high quality japonica rice. This is unprecedented. Yesterday, the price of glutinous rice in the market and gray market fell by about 0.50 yuan. Changshu and Wuxi japonica rice was around 46 yuan, Kunshan and Suzhou japonica rice was 45-46 yuan, Qingpu and Sijing extra thin rice was 45.50 yuan, medium quality was 44-45 yuan, and Nangang early and late rice was 42-43 yuan.

The early market for foreign rice continued the momentum from the previous day, wavering several times without changes. However, due to the persistence of traders, the cargo price was still sustainable, despite the sluggish sales market. Later, as the sales channel became more sluggish, most floating retailers realized that the overall situation was not good and sold off, leading to an oversupply and a gradual decline in prices. As a result, the closing price was about 0.50 yuan lower than the previous market, with No. 1 Saigon at 47 yuan.

The inventory of high-quality foreign rice was relatively small, so the selling price was still stable. The inventory of mid- to low-quality rice was abundant, and once floating retailers sought to sell, the market quietly softened. However, the forward trading continued to be brisk, as original merchants had a bullish view and were unwilling to sell, and about 4,500 to 4,600 tons of tradable chips in the market had been absorbed by the northern merchants and large households. Therefore, although the spot market showed a weakening trend, the asking price for No. 2 Saigon for April and May delivery was 54.50 yuan, and it once dropped lower in the afternoon, but the result was still at the original price. No. 1 road cargo was 55 yuan, and a total of more than 200 tons were offered, with about 7,000 bags of spot goods.

### Old Car Brand Flour Returns, Noticed by Speculators

The flour market trend is firm and quiet. The street's buying is not strong due to increased factory inventories. Only 5,000 to 6,000 bags are directly distributed by the factory. Sales are also slow due to the weekend, and new transactions are very quiet. However, customers still need a price of 15 yuan, so returning goods under old car brands are noticed by general speculators. Those who hold goods tend to hoard them, which is equal to the factory price, and supply is still lacking, leading to sustained support throughout the day. 1,000 bags of Yantai flour will be shipped on the 20th.

Trading in the wheat market has already started. Changshu and Wuxi wheat is priced at 21 yuan. Fuxin Factory purchased three cartloads, and Fufeng Factory is not purchasing for the time being. However, wholesale deliveries to the factory continue at 100 to 200 bags each, which have not yet been priced. The future of the wheat market is gradually stabilizing, it is said.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Soybeans Rise Sharply

Yesterday, the soybean market was strong. Firstly, the soybean cake market was extremely bullish, and oil mills were eager to buy. Secondly, although the export market had weakened, speculators were still absorbing supplies, so the market sentiment remained good, and prices rose repeatedly by 4-5 jiao. However, the overall trading was not as lively as yesterday. It is estimated that more than ten carloads of Bengbu soybeans were traded, priced at 24 yuan; more than 700 bags of Wuhu soybeans were traded, priced from 12.20 yuan to 23.70 yuan; 300 bags of Dingjia Zhou soybeans were traded, priced from 24.50 yuan to 25 yuan; 300 bags of Anqing soybeans were traded, priced from 23.16 yuan; 200 bags of Yangzhou soybeans were traded, priced at 19 yuan; 140 bags of Sangyuan soybeans were traded, priced at 20.70 yuan; and 50 bags of Taicang soybeans were traded, priced at 23.70 yuan.

### Yarn and Cotton: New Purchases Lacking, Yarn Market Softens

The yarn market is flat and weak, showing a slight downward trend. This is because actual sales are not as strong as in the past few days, which has softened sentiment. Many short-term speculators are liquidating their positions, causing the market to decline. Since cotton yarn exports are still large, there are still many people buying when the market falls. The situation is still fluctuating.

Spot yarn trading has slowed down. It is reported that Hong Kong merchants' actual demand is not smooth, and new purchases are not pouring in. The table is lax. The spot price for 20-count Double Horse yarn is 1,390 yuan, down 10 yuan, while the factory price is 1,370 yuan, down 14 yuan. It was then reported that foreign exchange rates were flat, and many retail investors sold off, causing prices to fall another 10 yuan or more. The lowest spot price was 1,370 yuan, and the factory price was 1,355 yuan. The market rallied again near the close. It is found that the half-day turnover was 2,000 bales. The spot price of 20-count Double Horse yarn fell by 19 yuan. The amount purchased by each faction is listed below:

Hong Kong 80 Wenzhou 50

Yunnan 170 Fellow traders 1,700

Total 2,000

### Indian Cotton Traders Compete to Buy, Local Cotton Trading Very Light, Yao Cotton Continues to Arrive in Shanghai

Local cotton trading is very light because factory demand is lacking, and the overseas Indian and American cotton markets are not very lively. Therefore, the cotton market situation is flat. However, fellow traders are actively buying and selling Indian cotton. Recently, incoming supplies have been arriving continuously. The Taikoo Company's Whangpoo steamer transported 1,130 bales of Yao cotton from Ningbo yesterday, berthing at the company's dock in the French Concession for unloading, so the cotton market is stable.

Foreign cotton market prices: the New York cotton market was quieter yesterday. Due to mass selling, the market weakened and the closing price was 200 points lower for near term and 7-8 points lower for distant future compared to the previous day. The Indian cotton market also fell with future forecasts due to a portion of the bulls losing interest and liquidating, down 5 rupees, and Egyptian rose 5-6 points.

Shanghai foreign cotton trading: According to reliable investigations, the market's raw cotton inventory is low. There will still be one or two ships arriving this month, but no ships will arrive from next month onwards, causing fellow traders to compete to buy spot goods. Cotton for spinning 20-count yarns is a popular item, and the spot price of Indian cotton is actually more than 20 yuan higher than the price quoted by foreign firms. Currently, only long staple cotton is available, and it can still be purchased for more than 10 yuan cheaper than the price quoted by foreign firms. Fellow traders are competing to purchase this raw cotton. Yesterday, 42 count American Mitterling raw cotton was traded at 297 yuan. The prices were converted into delivery-to-factory prices at an exchange rate of 6 yuan for USD, as listed on the left.

### Piece Goods: Piece Goods in Hand Sold Back at Low Prices, Fabric Mills Busy with Production

The futures market saw substantial turnover. Fabric mills are busy with production.

The piece goods market is gradually stabilizing. Retailers continue to sell factory goods, but the prices are difficult to match factory prices. There are many orders for 5-6 month delivery of gray fabrics, particularly autumn goods like wool serge and flannel. Finishing factories and plain street-dyed fabric shops are placing a lot of orders. Therefore, the factories do not have to worry about interrupted work recently. Most sellers did not change their prices yesterday. Hand-held goods were selling cheaply at 0.50 to 1 yuan per piece, and traders were buying them. The street traded nearly 100,000 pieces of coarse and fine cloth twill gray fabric. The Cantonese traders bought 10,000+ pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, and poplin. The Zhejiang and Jiangxi traders bought 100+ pieces of fine cloth, fine twill, and bleached cloth. 98 pieces of fabric will be transported to Yantai and 11 pieces to Tianjin on the 20th.

The morning market for Dong cloth was quite weak due to the drop in prices. Afterwards, Tianjin merchants bought in. Fellow traders in the street have always been optimistic, and they also started to raise prices. Although the turnover was not large, the fine cloth market gradually stabilized. The closing price for 12-pound "Dragon" cloth was 42.80 yuan, and the price for next month's order was 46 yuan. The current price for "Four Gentlemen" drill was 1.31 yuan per yard, and the price for next month rose to 1.42 yuan.

### Flannel is Selling Well

Recently, as the weather has gradually warmed, spring and summer wool fabrics have been selling briskly in a timely manner. Tailors have seen a sharp increase in clothing business, and sales of yard goods for Chinese clothing at retail shops have also increased. Flannel is selling particularly well, and sales are stable. Prices for most goods have already reached their peak and should reasonably drop a bit. Yesterday, domestic Tianjin-exported Ren Li and Tianma brand gray flannel was wholesaled for 16.75 yuan per yard, and the price for Gong Da Shen textiles was 15 yuan. Western goods from Hua Ji and Lao Gong Mao were 18 yuan, and number one British goods with a slanting flower pattern sold for 26-27 yuan, and number two board number four was 20 yuan.

### Rubberized Cloth Sales Are Even Stronger

Wool fabrics are in very tight supply, and sales are rising. Retail trade is very strong. Rubberized cloth sales are even more robust. Western goods are out of stock, and few domestic pure rubber products are available, so the market is extremely firm and rising. The material cost for imported goods made entirely of waxed thread has also risen dramatically due to the sharp increase in raw materials. Yesterday, the wholesale price for Shui Cheng rubberized cloth was 1.55 yuan per yard, Ren Tai was 1.65 yuan, Hong Sheng He genuine rubberized cloth sold for 4.25 yuan, Western goods Three Ports genuine rubberized cloth sold for 10.05 yuan, and yellow and white genuine pure rubberized cloth sold for 19 yuan.

### Coal: White Coal Rises Another 8 Yuan

Coal stacked up like mountains in warehouses, wholesale limited to two baskets

Although sales of various types of white coal have been very flat lately, owners have been hoarding it because of the expansion of the European war, and wholesale trade is limited to two baskets (1/8 of a ton). This has made people even more restless, and rumors are spreading, allowing the gray market to take the opportunity to manipulate prices. Yesterday, the Mallory vessel brought 2,500 tons of Hongji white coal, which was transferred at the pier and sold by Da Long Xing. Although there is plenty of coal stacked up in the warehouses, and there is no shortage, the listed price today has risen another 8 yuan, to 188 yuan per ton, it is said.

### Sugar Market: "Car White" Slackens

Yesterday, the sugar market trended weaker due to the release of 15,000 bags of "X" sugar from the previous day. The association's listed prices were 64.70 yuan for new 24 coarse white sugar from foreign warehouses and 64.50 yuan for old goods, unchanged. Taikoo "Car White" sugar showed some slackening, with "B Mark" sugar from Western warehouses at 71.42 yuan, down 0.02 yuan. Other "OW Mark" sugars were similarly reduced. Spot "Zero Red" sugar was 53.75 yuan, up 0.25 yuan. Domestic "Diao Qing" sugar continued to open at 50 bags, 51.50 yuan, up 0.50 yuan.

### Dried Goods: Miscellaneous Lichee Branches Weak

Recently, there have been some continued arrivals of miscellaneous lychee branches, but sales are still normal, so the market is gradually declining. The price of "Section Bamboo" branches has dropped by more than 10 yuan, and the current market price is less than 100 yuan. "Black Leaf" branches are even weaker, and high-quality goods are scarce. However, it is heard that the stock in the production areas is running out, so the prices are relatively firm, it is said.

### Cangzhou Jujubes Recover

Jujubes have fallen too much and are showing signs of recovery. Yesterday, 119 bags of Cangzhou jujubes were opened, with the wholesale price listed for North Specification at 30 yuan, up 5-6 yuan from before. At the same time, Tianjin goods are also showing a tight trend. Checks of the market show that the inventory is gradually decreasing. The inventory of genuine Tianjin goods is only a few hundred bags. The market price for Tianjin red jujube king is 60 yuan, jujube heads 50 yuan, first households 40 yuan, second households 30 yuan, and unified red jujubes 10 yuan. High quality Fujian jujubes are 22-23 yuan, ordinary ones are 18-20 yuan, and long red jujubes are 15-16 yuan.

### Yang Ge, Detained in Japan, Has Quietly Arrived in Shanghai, Bringing His Wife and Children to Reside at the Metropole Hotel for a Short Ten-Day Stay Before Returning to the United States

Yang Ge, the Far East General Manager of the American International News Service, formerly stationed in Tokyo, has arrived in Shanghai from Japan on the Yasukuni Maru with his wife and beloved child. He arrived at the port at 10 PM the night before last and is residing at the Metropole Hotel, where he will stay for a short ten days. Yang Ge was arrested in Tokyo on January 21 by the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department for allegedly disseminating "incorrect military information" and was detained for two months. Subsequently, the Tokyo Prosecutor's Office filed charges against him under Article 99 of the Army Criminal Code, and the Tokyo Court sentenced him on the morning of March 23 to six months of imprisonment with labor. However, because Yang Ge is an American citizen and, according to American law, citizens enjoy freedom of speech, and because he works in the press, the court decided to grant him a three-year suspended sentence. Yang Ge was released the next day. After Yang Ge's arrest, news of it caused widespread shock. It is understood that the reason for Yang Ge's arrest was that he published articles in Japanese newspapers about the situation in China, which the Japanese authorities considered to be shaking Japanese public opinion. Yang Ge had also held talks with Japanese and foreign friends at the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo, which was also resented by the Japanese authorities, leading to his arrest. However, because Yang Ge is an American citizen, they dared not make things too difficult for him, so they concluded the matter with a suspended sentence.

Will Return to the United States in a Short Period

After a short ten-day stay in Shanghai, Yang Ge will still go to Japan before taking the ashes of American journalist Harry Keys, who recently passed away in Beijing, back to the United States. Harry Keys died of a heart attack in front of Hibiya Park in Tokyo on April 10. His funeral was held two days later. The American Ambassador to Japan, Grew, and the Director of the Information Department of the Japanese Foreign Ministry, Su, representing Hirota, both attended the ceremony to pay their respects.

Japanese Domestic Turmoil and Unease

The English-American Great Evening Post published an article yesterday describing in detail the organization of terrorist groups in Japan and how they manipulate politics. The article begins by stating that Japan is now internationally isolated and is universally condemned as a threat to world peace and an aggressor. The reason for this is the active presence of terrorist groups in the country, who use

Coercive Means

to suppress all tendencies towards liberalism or to simultaneously plan conspiracies to expand the power of the Japanese Empire on the Asian continent. Japanese terrorist groups are roughly divided into two types: ronin and "warriors." Few of these Japanese terrorists are punished by the authorities. They are sometimes hired to

Hold Demonstrations

in front of foreign embassies, while the "warriors" are secret patriotic organizations that solicit donations from various shops. Those who refuse to donate are labeled as "unpatriotic." The ronin in China are all employed by Japanese reactionary societies. The most powerful of these societies is the Black Dragon Society, headed by Mitsuru Toyama. The society's activities are focused on opposing the Soviet Union, while other ronin suppress strikes and anti-dangerous elements. In Tokyo not long ago, a

Labor Party

leader named Oyama was severely beaten by them, and the police who witnessed the incident stood by and did nothing. The former Minister of Home Affairs, Suetsugu, was a member of the Kokuhonsha, and the former Prime Minister Hiranuma was the founder of the Kokuhonsha. General Masaki was also a member of the society. Since the "February 26" Incident, Hiranuma and his subordinates have gradually gained power. Therefore,

Japanese Politics

is entirely manipulated by these terrorists filled with fascist ideas, who act arbitrarily and attempt to conquer China by force. Once the war progresses to an unmanageable point, this reactionary ruling class will immediately collapse without a doubt.

### Farewell to the Five German Nationals; Statement from the French Consulate: These Five People Engaged in "Anti-French Activities," Hence a Friendly Advisory to Leave for Other Suitable Places

The French Consulate General in Shanghai announced on the 19th that five German nationals residing within the French Concession had been given a "friendly advisory" to leave the country by the end of this month. When the European War broke out, the French authorities notified the German nationals in the Concession that if they did not disturb the peace and if their actions did not violate the neutrality of the French Concession, they could continue to reside there without interference. However, these five German residents did not abide by this promise and have been ordered to move out by the end of the month. The French Consulate General has confirmed that they engaged in "anti-French activities." According to German sources, four other well-known German nationals have also been notified by the French Concession Police Department to leave. These four are believed to be representatives of the German official commercial news agency, Karl Molk, the scientific publicity section of the chemical company Haas, the representative of a German manufacturer, Xu Xin, and the German businessman, Hafmey. However, the French authorities have also admitted that another German national has also been ordered to leave, but they do not want to reveal his name.

### Three Clashes in Guerrilla Warfare West of Shanghai; Japanese Troops Suffer Heavy Losses; Several Thousand Japanese Troops Have Not Yet Withdrawn; Over Eight Hundred Elderly, Weak, Women, and Children Tragically Tortured

The mobile warfare west of Shanghai has been very active in recent days. The Japanese side is currently mobilizing heavy troops, about two or three thousand, along with about one thousand puppet troops, and deploying defenses along the Suzhou Creek and the Qinghu Highway. Since these Japanese troops were attacked by Chinese mobile units, they have been slaughtering innocent villagers for days. The tragedy that the Japanese army carried out when the Chinese army withdrew during the "August 13th" Shanghai battle is now being replayed in the area west of Hongqiao Airport, less than twenty kilometers from the Shanghai concessions. The following is a summary of the various situations recounted by villagers who came to Shanghai from the area yesterday afternoon:

Three Encounters

It is reported that the Chinese guerrillas near the Qinghu Highway have had three encounters with the Japanese army recently. The first was on the 12th of this month at Xiaolian Bridge, northwest of Hongqiao Airport along the Puhuitang, where fierce fighting lasted for five hours. The second was on the 15th of this month near the Xujing Zhaoxiang area at the junction of Qingpu and Shanghai, where fierce fighting lasted for seven hours. The third was near Dujiagang, west of Qibao Town in western Shanghai, where fierce fighting also lasted for three hours. Of these three battles, the battle of Zhaoxiang on the 15th of this month was the most damaging to the Japanese army, a rare occurrence in any mobile warfare in the suburbs of Shanghai.

Gu's Troops Break Through

After the Japanese army was first attacked by Chinese troops on the 12th of this month, they mobilized about three or four thousand Japanese and puppet troops, more than twenty tanks, and aircraft from the area west of Hongqiao Airport, east of Qingpu, north of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, and south of the Suzhou Creek to carry out a so-called "mopping-up" operation, hoping to wipe out the Chinese troops in one fell swoop. All the strongholds west of Shanghai, such as Hongqiao, Qibao, Panlong, Zhudi, Xinzhuang, Sijing, Qianjing, Huangbo, Nanxiang, Guanyintang, and other towns, have increased their heavy troops, forming an encirclement. As of yesterday afternoon, they had not yet withdrawn. However, it is said that Gu Fusheng's unit of the Third Detachment of the Chinese army broke through the heavy encirclement the day before and moved to a safe area for rest.

Village Calamities

However, after suffering losses, the Japanese army harbored resentment against the villagers for harboring Chinese troops, so they first set fire to peasant villages in Zhudi, Guanyintang, Dujiagang, and other places on a large scale. At least more than a thousand houses were destroyed, and villagers who encountered the Japanese army, regardless of age, were shot or stabbed to death with bayonets. In Guanyintang alone, about five hundred women, children, and elderly people were tragically tortured. Around Zhudi, about two hundred people were affected, and around Dujiagang, west of Qibao, about one hundred people were affected. As a result, those villagers in the area who had some wealth fled to Shanghai, and those who were poor and destitute fled to other places. Nearby towns have become nearly deserted. It is also reported that Gu's troops safely retreated from the Qinghu Road battle the night before last. The Japanese and puppet troops immediately advanced in two routes, one from Xujing north to Chongu Guanyintang, and the other from Xujing south to Dujiagang Xiaolian Bridge, searching house to house and shooting farmers indiscriminately. Many elderly, women, and children were humiliated.

Japanese Defense

Hongqiao Airport in western Shanghai had many buildings, all of which were destroyed during the Shanghai battle. The area is a key road west of Shanghai, and the Japanese side plans to station heavy troops there to prevent guerrilla attacks. Therefore, they have been building more than fifty barracks on the east side of the airport (i.e., at the intersection of Poasi Road) since the day before yesterday, all built with old bricks.

Attacks on Cars

According to transportation sources, a long-distance bus heading to Pinghu from Jiaxing the day before yesterday, full of passengers, was suddenly attacked near Jiuliting, resulting in the death of four passengers and the injury of more than ten others.

### Norwegian Ship Coming to Shanghai Forced to Sail to Hong Kong by a British Warship; All Danish and Norwegian Ships Sailing to Shanghai Will Be Restricted to Proceed Directly to Hong Kong to Await Orders

Danish and Norwegian merchant ships have recently been affected by the expansion of the European War. All Danish ships sailing in the Far East have been suspended, and Norwegian ships have also been ordered to concentrate in Hong Kong. Those in this city and Southeast Asia are continuing to sail to Hong Kong to await orders. The details have been reported in previous newspapers. It is now learned that the Danish ship Meizhongmei, which is berthed in Shanghai, also left Shanghai for Hong Kong on the morning of the day before yesterday (the 19th). The Meixi, which transported goods from Shanghai to Yantai at the beginning of this month, is still berthed in Yantai. Whether it will leave Yantai or go elsewhere is unknown. The Norwegian ship Wellford (managed by Jebsen & Co.), which was originally scheduled to load a large batch of corn, more than 6,000 bags, on the 12th of this month and transport it to Longkou, has unloaded the goods that had been loaded at the Longmao Wharf in Pudong. After completing the unloading on the 19th, it set sail for Hong Kong at about 8:00 AM yesterday morning (the 20th).

Norwegian Ship Rerouted

It is reported that the Norwegian ship Talismar, managed by the shipping department of the Tianxiang Company, was carrying goods from the United States via Little Luzon to Shanghai and was originally scheduled to arrive on the day before yesterday (the 19th). Unexpectedly, on the morning of the day before yesterday, it was stopped by a British warship while sailing in the waters of Daji. The ship has now sailed back to Hong Kong. The company also has two Norwegian ships, Titania and Tiranna, which are scheduled to arrive in Shanghai next Thursday (the 25th). According to the company, due to the above-mentioned situation, it is feared that they will not be able to come to Shanghai at that time. As for whether Norwegian ships can continue to sail in the Far East, although the manager of the China Shipping Company has been going to the consulate every day to discuss the matter for the past week, the results are still unknown. However, it is expected that an order will arrive in Shanghai within the next week with a definite solution.

Japanese Merchants Watching

The Continental Daily News reported that the Shanghai Japanese Navy spokesperson recently declared that "the Japanese military believes that the status of the charter ships has not changed because Denmark and Norway are neutral countries and have not declared war." Japanese merchants in the Far East, who have also chartered several Danish and Norwegian ships, are closely watching the development of the shipping situation, as the results of the development will have a significant impact on these ships.

### Abe Nobuyuki Arrives in Shanghai This Morning

Abe Nobuyuki, the special envoy sent by Japan to Nanjing, arrived in Shanghai on the Kashima Maru from Kobe on the 18th. According to shipping sources, the ship is scheduled to arrive at the Songkou port at 6:00 AM this morning and berth at the Huishan Wharf at 9:00 AM. It is said that the Japanese side has prepared to send a naval launch to Songkou to welcome Abe and escort him ashore to Shanghai. Abe will stay in Shanghai for a few days before going to Nanjing.

### Ms. Lin Xunxiu Dedicates Herself to the Nation

Since the beginning of the war of resistance, countless young men and women have gone deep into the interior, each contributing their talents to serve the country. It is now learned that Ms. Lin Xunxiu of Jinshan recently abandoned her comfortable life without informing her family and secretly left Shanghai. For three months, there was no news of her. Recently, a letter from Ms. Lin reported that she had safely arrived in Nancheng, Jiangxi, and was working at a service station under a group army. There are many female comrades there, and their morale is extremely high. It is learned that Ms. Lin graduated from McTyeire School several years ago and excelled in both academics and conduct. Later, she married into the Bohai family and was known for her ability to manage the household. Both the Lin and Bohai families are prominent in the region, so her life was comfortable. It is truly commendable that she has now resolutely gone deep into the interior to live her battlefield life.

### Relief for Zhongshan Refugees - Charity Broadcast Conference - Opened at the Xindu Radio Station Yesterday - Three-Day Conference Unprecedented in Scale

The Shanghai All Circles Relief for Zhongshan Refugees Charity Broadcast Conference, which had been in preparation for a long time, opened yesterday at the Xindu Hotel Glass Radio Station on Nanjing Road. At 11:30 a.m. yesterday, the chairman of the conference, Guo Shun, Feng Bingnan, Li Ze, and others led the opening ceremony with speeches. Prominent figures in the city, such as Yu Qiaqing, Lin Kanghou, and Yuan Ludeng, also enthusiastically participated. The conference will last for three days, from yesterday to the 22nd. Participants in the charity broadcast include famous musicians from Shanghai, high-ranking ladies, famous amateur opera singers, famous actors, famous courtesans, and all kinds of artists such as comedians and ballad singers who are enthusiastically participating. The scale is grand and the situation is unprecedented.

Yesterday's Results Exceeded Ten Thousand Yuan

The Xindu Hotel believes that the nature of this charity broadcast to aid the Zhongshan compatriots in distress is related to the belief and commemoration of the late Premier, so it voluntarily sacrificed three days of business and generously provided tea for the guests. The admission tickets are divided into two types: one yuan "Joyful Benevolence Ticket" and five yuan "Charity Ticket". Ladies from all walks of life actively participated. From 12:00 noon yesterday to 2:00 a.m. late at night, a total of more than ten thousand yuan was donated, which proves that the ladies of Shanghai, in addition to enjoying entertainment, are also extremely concerned about the compatriots in distress in the Premier's hometown.

Today and Tomorrow's Programs are Wonderful

Today's program includes various wonderful programs such as Chinese and Western music by Southern ladies, famous amateur opera singers, famous actors, comedians, and miscellaneous performances. It is hoped that benevolent ladies will gather their strength to assist.

Guo Shun's Speech

Guo Shun said in his speech, "Ladies and gentlemen, Zhongshan County has fallen once since October 7th last year. The countryside is devastated, and it is now the dead of winter. Residents are displaced and suffering from hunger and cold. The fellow villagers in Shanghai, following Hong Kong Zhongshan, established the Shanghai Relief Zhongshan Disaster Work on the fourth floor of Wing On Department Store on Nanjing Road on November 18th. The work is in progress. At the beginning of March of this year, it fell again. This disaster is more serious than last year. All the people in the county are displaced and wandering on the road. The tragic situation is unprecedented. Zhongshan County is the hometown of the late Premier and is concerned by China and foreign countries. Moreover, since the fall of Guangzhou, the area has become a transportation hub between Hong Kong and Macau, and a thoroughfare for people from the mainland. There are many people from other provinces who have taken refuge in the county. When the war comes, transportation is cut off first. The residents in the territory are waiting to die. The winter storage is empty, and spring farming is also affected. Therefore, the victims are from all provinces, not just the people of Zhongshan County. In order to step up fundraising, on the one hand, we have invited the Wing On Music Society to give a free Cantonese opera performance for six nights at the Lyceum Theatre from the 22nd of this month. On the other hand, from now on, for three consecutive days, we will invite famous musicians from this city to broadcast songs through this radio station. The songs requested and the income from the Xindu tea will be used to help the victims. I hope that all philanthropists will uphold the principle of not dividing regions in disaster relief, and generously donate to help the Zhongshan refugees get rid of their suffering. I am deeply grateful. Furthermore, this grand broadcast has been assisted by Mr. Yu Qiaqing and others. The vice chairman of this association, Mr. Li Ze, and the members Chen Qihao have been providing money and effort. All the musicians and famous amateur opera singers have been broadcasting voluntarily. All the benefactors have been donating enthusiastically. On behalf of the Zhongshan refugees, I would like to express my sincere gratitude."

Feng Bingnan's Speech

Mr. Feng Bingnan gave a speech at the opening ceremony of the charity broadcast of the Zhongshan Refugee Relief Association. Thank you to the association for not abandoning me. I should have come to the radio station in person to broadcast my opening speech, but I am not in good health, so I have been closing my doors to recuperate at home for more than two years. I have not been able to leave the house so far. According to the doctor's instructions, I am absolutely not allowed to go out, so it is not appropriate for me to give the opening speech. However, the gentlemen of the Zhongshan Refugee Relief Association have taken my situation into consideration and said that the Xindu Radio Station has installed a new rebroadcasting machine, and I can rebroadcast by phone at home. This shows that they have placed too much trust in me, so although I know that it is not appropriate for me to take on this task, I cannot strongly refuse. Today, I can only sit at home and speak, and I cannot come to the radio station in person. I am very sorry for this. I have always regarded serving the society as the highest vocation in life. As long as it is right and within my ability, I am happy to respond. Because I think that all things in the world are one, and all human beings are the same kind. If people of the same kind need my help, how can I not be happy to do my best? Since all mankind is like one whole body, if one part of the body is injured, the other parts must take care of it. If a place is unfortunately afflicted by disaster, places without disaster or with less disaster should help it. If some people are suffering, those without suffering or with less suffering should think of ways to help them. If one part of the body is injured and the other parts are unaware and do not care, then that person is numb. Zhongshan County has unfortunately been repeatedly afflicted by disaster, and the severity of the disaster can be imagined. Listeners, I think many of you have personally experienced a life of hardship. Now we are considered to be living in a relatively safe area, but don't forget the misery of our fellow human beings in the insecure areas. They are worried about planes and bombs day and night. The injured may not receive medical care. Many who are lucky enough not to be injured often endure unbearable hunger and thirst under the scorching sun. Not only is it difficult to eat a mouthful of rice, but they can't even drink a mouthful of water. They are exposed to the elements, wind and rain, and many of them are sick. The tragic scene cannot be described in words. They are waiting for death at all times, and they are also expecting fellow human beings to come and rescue them at all times. Now, the fellow villagers in Zhongshan County feel the extreme pain suffered by their hometown and have launched this association to seek relief. This is indeed a spirit of self-help. Those who can help themselves are qualified to ask for help from others. Therefore, the Zhongshan fellow villagers should enthusiastically support this initiative. Even those who are not from Zhongshan, or even people from any other place, have the obligation to help. Whether it is a person, a place, or a country, first of all, it must have a spirit of self-help, and give full play to its own abilities. When it is necessary, it can ask for help from others. When someone asks for your help, if the request is reasonable and you have the ability to do so, you should not hesitate to help them, because mutual assistance is the highest morality of mankind and the most important condition for human survival. Not only is it necessary to help each other in times of crisis, but also in ordinary times. No one can do without the help of others, and no one should not help others. The reason why human beings are different from animals, and the reason why human beings have been able to survive in the world for tens of millions of years, is because they have developed this virtue of mutual assistance, and they have been helping each other unconsciously. Only with mutual assistance can there be a society, and only with mutual assistance can there be a world. The current disaster is not only in Zhongshan, nor is it only in China. Three-quarters of the world are in a very chaotic situation. It is a time of upheaval. Even those who live in relatively peaceful Shanghai are inevitably affected by this disaster. Every day when we open the newspaper, almost four-fifths of it is reporting news of human beings suffering. Since human beings are in such a difficult situation, they should give full play to the spirit of mutual assistance in order to survive. We are all in the same boat. In calm seas, we still need to cooperate with each other. If the waves are dangerous, we need everyone to help each other to get through safely. Today I can help others, and others will help me in the future. A person needs help from others in many places, not necessarily referring to disasters. This time, the Shanghai Relief Zhongshan Refugee Association is holding a charity broadcast to raise funds for relief. Many actors and amateur artists are volunteering to sing. This is the powerful contributing their strength, and the listeners are donating to request songs. This is the rich contributing their money, which is very much in line with the purpose of mutual assistance. Not only should the Zhongshan Refugee Relief Association thank the enthusiastic people on both sides who contribute money and effort, but also those who are concerned about the welfare of mankind. I am also one of mankind, so I should also express my gratitude to the people who contribute money and effort, and to all the artists. The holding of this association has not only been supported by fellow villagers, but has also been sympathized by people from other provinces. I just heard that Mr. Yu Qiaqing, Mr. Jin Tingsun, Mr. Yuan Ludeng, and Mr. Lin Kanghou have sympathy for this association. They have invited artists from other provinces to help with a day's program. The originally planned two-day broadcast has now been extended to three days, which shows that everyone has the same heart of mutual assistance. The enthusiasm of Mr. Yu Qiaqing, Mr. Jin Tingsun, and the artists from other provinces is worthy of our deep gratitude. Some people may criticize the holding of broadcasting and performances, thinking that in this time of war and turmoil, how can we bear to hold entertainment? Didn't Ouyang Xiu say, "Worry and labor can rejuvenate a country, while pleasure and ease can destroy oneself"? I think there can be two views on entertainment. Everything has a limit. Everything that is within the limit is right. Anything that exceeds the limit is not good. Entertainment is also like this. Excessive entertainment can make people indulge in pleasure and lose their ambition, waste time and delay matters, and waste energy and money. Entertainment that is within the limit can regulate the spirit and increase work efficiency. Therefore, after a person is extremely tired and extremely nervous, being able to use entertainment as a relief can easily restore the spirit and prevent health from being damaged. Among the six arts in ancient China, music, archery, and horsemanship accounted for half of them. Music, archery, and riding are all things that belong to entertainment. Just like a person who is tired from work cannot but sleep, we cannot say that in times of crisis, we are not allowed to sleep. In times of crisis and survival, regulating the spirit and maintaining health is also an important thing. The more troubled and depressed you are, the more you need entertainment. Entertainment itself is not bad, it just depends on whether the nature of the entertainment is noble. Wise men in ancient times also used wine to relieve their sorrows, but excessive drinking may not be beneficial to health. However, we can already see that in times of tension and depression, everyone needs adjustment. I am saying these words not to defend the entertainment operators, but based on the facts. Moreover, I have no taste for other general entertainment except reading, and I have not participated in the entertainment business, so I am the most qualified to say this fair word. Finally, I hope that all listeners, regardless of provincial boundaries, county boundaries, and even national boundaries, all who have the sympathy of human mutual assistance, will enthusiastically support the relief work of the Zhongshan Refugee Relief Association this time. I have said a lot of words and wasted a lot of your time. Now, in the capacity of a member of mankind, I would like to express my gratitude to all the listeners and to the staff who have contributed their efforts."

(3) After the export commodities are settled in foreign exchange, the 3% handling fee charged by the bank when receiving the exchange rate difference shall be borne by the government, and the merchants shall be exempted from payment.

### After Commander Xie's Mother Died - Expresses His Feelings and Strives Hard - Grieved and Enduring, Diligently Learning and Practicing - Hoping Not to Betray the Expectations of Compatriots

Li Tai, the mother of Commander Xie Jinyuan of the Lone Army Camp, passed away due to illness on the 12th in her hometown of Jiaoling, Guangdong. Commander Xie was deeply saddened because he was stranded on a isolated island and unable to attend the funeral. All circles in Shanghai expressed their condolences to Xie for the tragic death of his mother, hoping that he would restrain his grief and cherish himself for the sake of the country. Xie specifically issued a statement yesterday to thank all circles for their condolence. The original text says, "At 6:00 p.m. on April 13th, I received a telegram from home and was shocked to learn that my old mother had passed away in the morning. The bad news came and I was heartbroken. Jinyuan is ungrateful, and was not able to serve her medicine when she was alive, and could not see her burial after her death. Encountering family difficulties, and causing further sorrow to my elderly father, I am confused and ashamed. The sin of unfilial piety will be regretted forever. Since my elder brother passed away in the 18th year of the Republic of China, leaving only one daughter, and Jinyuan has dedicated himself to the party and the country, and is busy with military affairs, I am alone. My mother had already mourned the sudden death of her son, and relied on her son to return. My mother's hair turned white, and the family was in decline. Sadness and grief caused her health to decline day by day, and she often fell ill. How could heaven not bless my mother's remaining years? Alas, it is painful! Jinyuan has been trembling and restless for ten days, sitting and lying uneasily. According to my fortune, this year is extremely difficult and dangerous. I am worried in my heart. On the 9th, I read my father's letter dated March 2nd, knowing that my mother was weak and thinking of her son eagerly, sobbing at midnight. After reading it, I shed tears. I sent a telegram, roughly saying, "I am in pain of losing my freedom, in case of death, this regret will be endless." According to the time, it should have arrived on the evening of the 10th or noon on the 11th, but my mother passed away on the morning of the 13th. As the saying goes, "A loving mother's love for her son is in her heart." My mother worked hard all her life, saved money, and raised Jinyuan to adulthood. Before her death, she only protected these few words of telegram, which increased Jinyuan's fear and panic. Since Jinyuan left home at the age of 18 to study in Guangzhou, and after four years, transferred to the Whampoa Military Academy, and graduated in the 15th year of the Republic of China, and followed the army on the Northern Expedition, only in the autumn of the 17th year of the Republic of China did I return home to visit my family for two weeks due to injury, and in the spring of the 25th year of the Republic of China, I sent my family back to my hometown twice. Unexpectedly, this farewell would be a final farewell. My family has a small amount of property, works diligently, and is frugal, and does not worry about freezing or starving. However, my family is in a "weak house" position, and is often bullied and insulted for no reason. My father and mother have endured hardships and swallowed their anger for decades. However, my brother and I are naturally foolish and wise. As children, we could not bear the oppression of the environment on my family, and we stood up and argued with reason. However, because our strength was not as good as others, we were often subjected to abuse and beatings by the strong. Thinking about it now, it is still vivid in my mind. My mother is kind, gentle, thrifty, hardworking, and cares for her children. She personally takes care of everything, food and clothing, and teaches them. She never slacks, but my family is in a difficult situation, so the constraints on the children are particularly strict. A meal and a porridge cannot be taken lightly. However, Jinyuan is particularly naughty by nature, which often makes my mother unable to laugh or cry. I especially remember when I was a child, whenever I saw my mother kill a chicken or duck, she would always mutter something. Jinyuan once asked, "What is my mother saying?" She said that you are young and ignorant, and you smile when you see animals being killed, but all things in the world have their own spirituality, and killing is a sin. My mother does not believe in religion, but the kindness and compassion of her are too numerous to write down. Thinking about the past and the present, I have mixed feelings. Jinyuan will from now on atone for his sins in the ranks, and will work harder and be more vigilant, and be loyal to repay the country. Therefore, in the past thirty months, the dangerous environment and the humiliation of the strong have increased with time. The decline of public reason and justice, and international law has become a tool used by a part of the people. The difficult years are not known to end. Only whether people are involved in the revolution, looking up to the country and the nation, and are determined to "endure pain and learn diligently" to pray that they will not betray the nurturing of heaven and earth, the cultivation of the party and the country, and the teachings of good teachers and the expectations of compatriots. Furthermore, we must closely follow the instructions of the leader to "be independent, self-reliant, and self-strengthening", work hard to encourage ourselves, and adhere to the principles of "not being discouraged, not yielding, and not being humiliated", so as to not disgrace this life, to redeem the deep grace of my virtuous mother in the days to come, and to comfort the hope of the nine springs."

### British Federation Shipyards All Struck - Shengjing Delayed from Docking

The four shipyards of the British Federation, the Yaisong and Ruiyong shipyards, have been on strike for a long time. Now it is known that the Xiang Sheng and Hefeng factories in Pudong have also been affected. The Taikoo Company's Beiyang liner Shengjing, which was undergoing annual repairs at the Hefeng factory shipyard, should have been completed last Friday according to regulations. Due to the impact of the strike, the unloaded propellers and anchors could not be installed and the ship could not leave the dock. In addition to negotiating with the factory, Taikoo Company hired Russian craftsmen to go to the factory to install the parts. It was scheduled to leave the dock yesterday and resume sailing today, but it could not be completed on time, so it failed to leave the dock yesterday. It is said that it will be able to leave the dock today and sail to the company's wharf in the French Concession, and resume sailing next Tuesday (23rd). However, the cargo of the Hakka people reported to be loaded on the ship has been piled up at the wharf.

### Many Robbers Arrested - Receiver of Stolen Goods Arrested - Confesses to Receiving - Case Still Under Investigation

The French Concession Police recently cracked the case of highway robbers Lu Jinrong, Zhang Jinsheng, Xu Abing, Zhang Xiaodi, Xia Shunsheng, Lu Jiasheng, Wu Jinsu, and eight others, and sent them to the Second Special Court for interrogation and investigation, and pursued the stolen goods for further investigation. During the investigation, it was found that Feng Xiaoyun (40 years old, local), the owner of the Dazhong Hotel on Zhengjia Bridge, Avenue Edward VII, had bought stolen goods, so Feng was arrested and sent to the Second Special Court for detention.

Combined Trial

The details have been recorded in this newspaper. Now, the Shanxi Road Police found that the Daike Goudang Department of Laotianshi Silver Shop on Avenue de France also received stolen goods, and arrested the store manager Wang Changchun. Yesterday morning, the police sent Lu and other robbers and Feng and Wang, who received the stolen goods, to the Criminal Division 1 of the Second Special Court, where Judge Miao Qingbang interrogated them. The police lawyer requested a postponement due to the unresolved investigation, and said that Lu Jinrong had confessed that he had robbed a Russian woman of

a pair of diamond earrings

worth 2,000 yuan at the entrance of No. 2831 Avenue de France at the end of September last year, and sold them to Laotianshi Silver Shop for 190 yuan. Xu Abing confessed that he had robbed a woman Chen Chen's handbag at the entrance of No. 168 Route Wagner on the 6th of this month, which contained a gold cigarette holder, a gold cigarette case, and a diamond-studded watch, worth a total of 2,300 yuan, and sold them to Feng Xiaoyun for 460 yuan, and so on. During the interrogation, the robbers confessed to committing robbery or participating in robbery, and Wang Changchun also

admitted to receiving stolen goods.

Feng Xiaoyun confessed that Yao Rongfu rented a corner of the Dazhong Hotel to set up a business for redeeming pawned goods, and Xu sold the stolen goods to Yao. They negotiated the price in an empty small room, which I saw and scolded Yao for not talking in the empty room and told them to go out. The stolen goods were bought by Yao, and I did not participate. He also hired lawyer Ai Zhenlin to defend him. After the court verified the confession, it ordered a postponement for further interrogation on the 25th, and the defendants were returned to custody.

### Police and Robbers Fight - Robber Arrested and Interrogated - Main Criminal Wang Ashe on the Run

Chen Xiaoming, a pediatrician from Danyang, at No. 54, Lane 177, Qipu Road, was suddenly invaded by five armed robbers at 11:15 a.m. on the 19th. They took out pistols, threatened them not to make a sound, robbed property worth 140 yuan, and swaggered away. The tea servant Wang Xihe followed them to the opposite side of the First Special District Court on North Zhejiang Road, and four robbers hired a car from Taitelai Motor Company, intending to rob somewhere else. The report was made to the patrol officers No. 565, Hua Sandao Tou, and No. 1443, No. 1667, No. 2202, and No. 355 and other four Chinese police officers, who surrounded the car. The robbers resisted arrest and opened fire. Both sides fought. As a result, one robber was shot dead and two were captured. Two pistols and seven bullets were seized. A stray bullet injured a 12-year-old boy, who died from his injuries after a while, and Lu Lianyuan, a native of Tongzhou, were treated in the hospital. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. Now it has been found that the dead robber's name is Qi Asheng, 20 years old (origin unknown). The two robbers who were arrested are Jin Honggen (27 years old) and Chen Zhenglin (33 years old), both from Jiangbei. Jin was also shot several times in the body and is being treated in the patrol hospital. The two bodies of the dead robber Qi Asheng and the 12-year-old boy were taken to the Jiaozhou Road Morgue for examination. Yesterday morning, the police sent the arrested robber Chen Zhenglin to the Criminal Division 3 of the First Special Court. The police lawyer Qian Xunjiu claimed that the leader of the robbers, Wang Afu, was on the run, and requested a postponement. Then, the doctor Chen Xiaoming and the tea servant Wang Xihe testified to the incident. When Chen was questioned, he confessed that he was invited by the fugitive Wang Afu to commit the robbery, and that the pistols and other items were all from him. The rest of the confession was vague. Judge Jiang Shuzi ordered him to be returned to custody and re-examined at a later date.

### Russians Carrying Handcuffs - Attempt to Rob Police Officer's Pistol

At about 9:00 p.m. on the night before (the 19th), two neatly dressed Russians, carrying a pair of handcuffs, suddenly arrived at the Zhongxi Sanatorium at No. 536 Rue Paul Beau. They were spotted by Ding, a Chinese guard from Anhui, No. 289 of the hospital, who thought they were Western police officers from the police station. He immediately stepped forward. Unexpectedly, the two Russians asked him where his pistol was. He replied that he was not wearing it and it was hidden in his room. Upon hearing this, the visitors took out handcuffs and handcuffed him, forcing him to ask where it was hidden. At this time, the hospital had received the news and knew that they were robbers, so they immediately called the police station. By the time the police officers arrived, the two Russian criminals had already escaped without a trace.

### Rogue Highway Robbers Arrested

Recently, a large number of young rogues have been robbing pedestrians of their property in the area of Avenue Edward VII and North Jiangxi Road. At about 10:00 a.m. the day before, Wang Bingrong, a native of Ningbo, was carrying a bag of tin foil ash worth 120 yuan when he passed by the area. The rogues saw him and thought that there was money or legal tender hidden in the bag, so they rushed forward and surrounded him, robbing him of the tin foil ash and fleeing in different directions. As a result, Shi Huanting, a Chinese detective from the Hongkou Police Station, arrested Yi Daqun, a native of Tongzhou, and took him to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Special Court, where the police lawyer Qian Xunjiu requested detention. The court ruled that the case would be re-examined at a later date.

### Summary of General Manager Fan Keling's Speech at the Annual Meeting (3)

As mentioned above, the ordinary reserve fund had been almost entirely depleted. Therefore, it was decided last year to increase the surtax rate to 18% starting from October 1st. At the same time, it was hoped that the exchange rate would not continue to decline and that income would remain normal, so that a balanced budget could be produced for 1940. The severe drop in the national currency around July of last year deeply affected the budget. In order to remedy this, a special sub-committee was formed to study the Bureau's economic situation. The committee formulated several recommendations, which were all adopted by the Bureau. Simultaneously, the Bureau managed to borrow a new loan of 10 million yuan to meet urgent needs.

The budget for each department for this fiscal year has already been published separately. The draft budget was carefully scrutinized, resulting in a total reduction of more than 2 million yuan. Unfortunately, the current skyrocketing food prices have led to an increase of approximately 1.5 million yuan, offsetting the budget reductions.

Regarding this year's recurrent income, including the proposed additional surcharge and excluding educational expenses and the previous year's deficit, it is estimated that the net income will be around 37,806,700. The budget for each item of income has been prepared based on various facts. If there are no significant changes during the year, it should be possible to achieve the goals. Due to the income from various public utilities and municipal services, an increase of 2,632,000 yuan is expected this year. The allocation for educational expenses is 2,711,440 yuan, corresponding to a surtax rate of 2%.

The total estimated recurrent expenditure is approximately 42,870,390 yuan, excluding educational expenses and the previous year's deficit. Last year's recurrent expenses totaled 28,232,460 yuan. The biggest reason for the increase is the depreciation of the national currency, which has led to a sharp increase in various expenses required for the Bureau to maintain good administrative efficiency. While the Bureau has made every effort to economize, it has also taken into account the need to maintain and develop key tasks, and cannot be negligent even in these uncertain times. Department heads have been able to understand the Bureau's intention to save, and each plan that requires large expenditures has been carefully considered before being approved. Most foreign staff members have temporarily suspended their furloughs this year, saving considerable expenses.

The Police Department's needs for this year are approximately 4,367,360 yuan more than last year. If we can understand the importance of maintaining law and order under the current circumstances, we will not consider the increased police expenses to be unreasonable.

Ordinary expenses are approximately 5,304,920 yuan more than last year. The biggest reason is that the amount of staff pensions and other retirement benefits that must be paid according to regulations has increased due to the tightening of the exchange rate. These expenses are bound by contracts, and it is impossible to reduce them for the time being unless the exchange situation improves. The guaranteed exchange rate for staff savings has been revised, reduced to eight pence from May 1st of this year. Furthermore, future employee compensation will be calculated in national currency as much as possible. Once these two measures are implemented, it is hoped that ordinary expenses can be gradually reduced.

As for the estimated deficit in the recurrent expenditure budget for this year, it is 5,572,280 yuan, of which 509,590 yuan is the shortfall in educational expenses. Educational expenses are not allowed to exceed the income from a surtax rate of 2%, but this year's educational expense budget must exceed this due to a sharp increase in various expenses. In the future, efforts should be made to reduce expenses and increase tuition fees in order to reduce the aforementioned budget deficit. Although the educational expense budget was approved, the additional allocation was not passed after discussion.

The estimated budget for various temporary expenses is around 1,859,6306 yuan, which does not include temporary educational expenses. The deficit carried over from the previous year is 2,970,530 yuan. This year's funds are intended to cover various major facilities, debt repayment, pension fund contributions, emergency measures, and to make up for the deficit in the recurrent expenditure budget, totaling 13,889,100 yuan. Among them, the expenses for land requisition, construction, and various other expenses have been reduced to a minimum. The temporary expenditure for education is a construction cost of 89,600 yuan.

Various temporary income, due to the sale of the Bureau's surplus land, can yield 950,000 yuan. Other miscellaneous income is estimated at 30,000 yuan. In order to cope with various expenditures in this year's temporary expense budget, it is planned to issue new public bonds or use other methods to raise 16 million yuan, the use of which is stated in the temporary expense budget.

All of this year's Bureau's various expense budgets, as well as the proposed surtax increase measures, together with the funds to be raised in the temporary expense budget, totaling no more than 16 million yuan or its equivalent, are hereby requested to be approved by the General Assembly for implementation.

### Drug Dealers and Extortionists Apprehended in Jiangsu Inn; Handcuffs and Five Ounces of Drugs Confiscated

Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the Anti-Narcotics Division of the Central Police Department received a tip-off and rushed to Room 122 of the Jiangsu Inn at No. 50, Lane 379, Guangdong Road. There, they apprehended Yuan Shuangxi, a Yangzhou native, for selling heroin, and confiscated five and a half ounces of heroin. In the same room, they also apprehended You Zhifang, Chen Wuzi, and Wang Hanzheng, all natives of Changzhou, on suspicion of impersonating public officials, illegally exercising authority, and extorting money. They confiscated a pair of handcuffs, a police whistle, a training rope, and an appointment license. This morning, they were all sent to the First Special Court to apply for a postponement of the hearing to investigate whether the defendants had already committed extortion cases within the concession. The judge of the First Criminal Court approved the detention for one week.

### Driver Causes Accident; Sentenced to One Year; Civil Suit to be Heard Separately

Zhou Esheng, a local resident living at No. 24, Xinmin Village, Malang Road, is currently the accounting director of the Jiangxi Dayu Resources Committee. He has only one son, Zhou Zuomin (12 years old this year, studying at Fuchun Primary School in Lane 157, Luban Road), who is also adopted by four families, so he loves him dearly. At 12:20 PM on the of this month, he was taking his son home from school when a private car, number 7200, owned by Mr. Perrier Yuan of the Lujiawan Bus Company, driven by Peng Chaohua (35 years old, from Yancheng), sped by. The car failed to brake in time and knocked Zhou’s son down, resulting in his death. The police sent Peng to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court, prosecuting him under Article 276, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. The deceased's mother, Zhou Shuying, appointed lawyer Dai Jien to file a civil suit, demanding compensation of 15,280 yuan. The case was concluded yesterday morning by Judge Miao, who ruled that Peng Chaohua was guilty of causing death due to negligence in his profession and sentenced him to one year of imprisonment. The civil suit was transferred to the Civil Court.

### Inspector of Rongsheng Gambling Den Impersonates Detective and Extorts Money; Sentenced to Ten Months

Gong Chengqi, a 21-year-old native of Nanjing, worked as an inspector at the Rongsheng gambling den in West Shanghai. Last month, he impersonated a detective from the French Concession Police Department, carried a pistol, and extorted 500 yuan in national currency from the Yongsheng Paper Shop at No. 55, Panxin Road. The shop owner, Yu Renxiang, reported the case to the police, who apprehended Gong and sent him to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court for prosecution on charges of extortion. The defendant vehemently denied the extortion. Yesterday morning, Judge Miao continued the hearing and sentenced Gong Chengqi to ten months of imprisonment, and confiscated the pistol.

### While Shop Owner Was Away, Accountant Steals Cash and Jewelry

Chen Yongdian, an accountant from Wenzhou at Yongfeng Timber Shop, No. 174, Annakin Road, in the French Concession, broke into the bedroom while the shop owner was away on the 14th of this month. He pried open the iron box and stole a gold pendant, a small gold scissors, a gold chain, and 45 yuan in cash. It was not until the day before yesterday that the shop owner, Lin Xilin, discovered the theft and handed Chen over to the police. After investigation, the facts were verified, and Chen was sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special Court yesterday for prosecution.

### Silk Mill Leaders Plan to Establish General Relief Hospital

Silk mill industry leaders in this city, Zhu Jing’an, Shen Huaichen, and Mr. Sheng, recently initiated the establishment of a General Relief Hospital. They have already purchased the original site of the secondary school affiliated with Jinan University at the intersection of Tao’erfeisi Road and Luban Road in the French Concession from the Trust Department of the Zhejiang Industrial Bank. The building is spacious inside, and preparations are underway to open it as soon as possible. In the future, silk mill workers who are ill only need to provide a certificate from the trade association, and all hospitalization and outpatient medical expenses will be waived. This is truly good news for silk mill workers.

### Carelessness at Eyeglass Factory on Columbia Road

A certain eyeglass factory at Nos. 8-10, Yunliang Fang, Fahua Bridge, Columbia Road, in West Shanghai, suddenly caught fire at 5:10 AM yesterday. The fire was very intense because the eyeglass materials inside were all made of tortoiseshell, celluloid, and other materials, which are difficult to extinguish once ignited. The fire quickly spread to the Meifeng Silk Weaving Factory at Nos. 11-12. The Central Fire Brigade rushed to the scene and extinguished the fire after about two hours. As a result, 96 bungalows were burned down. When the fire was at its height, two apprentices, Xu Fangshou (16 years old) and Shi Qingsheng (17 years old), jumped out of the windows, injuring their shoulders and arms. They were taken to the Refugee Hospital by ambulance for treatment.

### All Iron Gates in Nanshi Open; Vehicles Can Now Pass

Since the opening of the iron gates at Xinkaihe, Xinqiao Street, Nanyang Bridge, and Xie Bridge, which connect the French Concession to Nanshi, only Xinkaihe and Xinqiao Street have been open to vehicles. Recently, the central gate of Nanyang Bridge and other iron gates has also been opened, and ropes have been used as barriers, so cars and rickshaws can now pass through. However, the number of people entering and exiting these gates these days is sparse.

### Medical Association Requests Exemption from Occupational Tax

Since this year, the French Concession Public Works Bureau has been collecting a general occupational license tax, which includes doctors. The Municipal Medical Association believes that the nature of this tax seems redundant and has unanimously requested the authorities to exempt them. At the same time, it has notified its members within the concession to postpone payment until the negotiations are concluded.

### Employment Agency Seeks Talent

### Old News from the Past - Sixty-Seven Years Ago (361)

(From the Shen Bao of the Twelfth Year of Tongzhi of the Qing Dynasty)

**On Building in Yin**

Heaven opened in Zi, Earth established in Chou, and Humanity was born in Yin. These are the Three Powers and the Three Beginnings, and the three dynasties built their calendar years differently, passing on the legacy. Confucius told Yan Zi that it was necessary to “follow the calendar of the Xia dynasty.” Why? The calendar of the Zhou dynasty built from Zi. As a commoner, Confucius dared not defy the orthodox calendar that was intended by the imperial court, but he saw that building in Zi and Chou was not as good as building in Yin. Yao ordered Yi and He to “respectfully impart the seasons to the people.” If you interpret the meaning of this, you can see that the important thing about the seasons is humanity. Therefore, the Xia calendar built in Yin, and the four seasons did not lose their order. Building in Zi and Chou would change winter into spring. The Qin calendar built in Hai, making the tenth month of winter the first month, and thus completely changing winter, spring, summer, and autumn. With Confucius' teaching, kings can take example. From the Han Dynasty onward, all used the Xia calendar, so the beginning of the year had a fixed system, and the meaning of humanity being born in Yin became clear. Although the Zhou dynasty used Zi, Duke Zhou created the *Erya* , where the names of the years also began with Yin and ended with Chou. Those who used the Heavenly Beginning were simply following the idea that the Three Kings did not follow each other, in order to clarify what each dynasty esteemed. To build in Yin as the proper way, they also could not have been unaware of the meaning of it. Only the beginning of the year should use Yin. Therefore, Jiazi is used to record the years, months, days, and hours, and the hour is used to clarify Yin. Heaven's time and Earth's time are not mentioned, but only human time is mentioned, because its meaning is tied to humanity. The year is renewed in Yin, and one must rise early in Yin. If we talk about the beginning and end of a year or the beginning and end of a day, then Hai is the end and Zi is the beginning, and the meaning of humanity's time will not be clear in the beginning of the year's Zi month, or the Zi hour of the sky’s dawn. Now let us speak of it in terms of humanity. From the beginning of the year to the end of the year, there is not a single idle day. The things that one does must be summed up at the end of the year. If things go smoothly, and the profit of the year is great, one will surely double the efforts in the coming year. If one's luck is bad and things do not go as planned, one must calculate how much has been lost and say that next year will be dangerous. It is my wish that everyone knows the meaning of building in Yin at the beginning of the year is in humanity's time, and to quickly plan for self-preservation.

### Abolish a Few Bad Habits

— Yong

Little friends! Do you know that all kinds of prices on the isolated island are soaring like they're flying? I think all the smart little friends are figuring out how to save money. In short, at this time, you should no longer arbitrarily waste your parents' money. At the very least, from today onwards, you should eliminate the following bad habits if you have them, and encourage yourselves if you don't.

1.  Eating snacks: Eating snacks not only costs money but is also harmful to the body. You see, many little friends eat snacks all day long, leading to a sallow complexion and lack of nutrition. Proper and moderate eating is the only secret to obtaining health, please remember this sentence well.

2.  Reading comic strips: When little friends have free time, they often like to ask their parents for a few cents to rent some martial arts and supernatural comic strips from the small bookstalls on the streets; these kinds of books are absolutely useless to little friends, so they are also a waste of money. You may as well save the money you get and then go to the bookstore to pick out some practical and meaningful books, which will be beneficial.

3.  Scribbling on paper: Eight or nine out of ten little friends like to grab a piece of snow-white paper and scribble on it for a while, and then throw it away. Some even tear out pages from their exercise books without knowing how to cherish them: this bad habit is also not something that a good student should have. Wasting resources, this should be the biggest waste!

The above three points are almost the easiest to find among little friends. If one person doesn't have any of these three habits, then they are considerate enough of their parents. As for talking about how to reduce the burden on parents and increase the income of families, it is not something that you can do.

### Dangerous Magnetic Mines Are No Longer Dangerous

— Lu Anzhi

Little friends, if you have a good memory, you should remember that in the two or three months after the outbreak of the European War, newspapers often reported daily that British, French, or neutral ships had been tragically sunk after hitting mines. But the reason for hitting the mines was mostly due to encountering the magnetic mines recently invented by Germany, because these mines are equipped with extremely strong electromagnets and move freely on the sea surface. So when ships pass nearby, they can attract these mines, causing them to explode. To prevent the danger of these mines, scientists from various countries in Britain and France spent a lot of effort researching ways to avoid hitting the mines. Several months ago, they finally came up with a method to prevent these terrible mines. This defensive method is to avoid using steel-made machinery on merchant ships or warships, such as steam boilers, propulsion machines, engines, etc., and try to replace them with aluminum and other alloys. The key is to place two extremely strong anti-magnetic electromagnets at the bow and stern of the ship. Since similar magnetic forces repel each other, magnetic mines not only cannot approach the ship but instead move away. Now, large merchant ships in Britain and France are equipped with this device, so they can safely cross the dangerous Atlantic Ocean. As for why the machinery on ships cannot be made of steel, it is because these extremely strong anti-magnetic electric magnets can affect the rotation of steel machinery. It is said that German submarines have long been equipped with this kind of electromagnet, which also prevents the danger of their own mines. However, it was kept secret, and now Britain and France are also using this magnetic mine to step up the blockade of the German coastline, which can be said to be the retribution of warmongers.

### The Bending of Light

— Su Ming

When the clock struck seven, whether it was a weekday or a holiday, Yong-er had already gotten up, washed his face, brushed his teeth, and drank a cup of salt water. This had become his habit. If one day there was no boiling water to make salt water, he would feel very uncomfortable and would wait until he had drunk it, or else he would rather skip breakfast.

Today, he got up, washed his face, and brushed his teeth. Then, he poured water into the cup with salt, and stirred it with a chopstick to make the salt dissolve faster. Who knew that today he would unintentionally discover another miracle—often when he put a chopstick into the water, it seemed from outside the cup that the chopstick was bent, as if it was about to break. He quickly took the chopstick out of the water, but it was still as good as new. He put it back into the water, and it bent again. He became curious and went to ask his older brother—Zong-er: "Why does the chopstick seem to bend in the water?"

"This is a physics principle of optics. Light travels in a straight line in the air, so we call it a light ray. But when light travels from one environment to another, it will change its path. This is a very strange phenomenon in nature. The question you raised is this phenomenon, because light rays travel from air to water, and air and water are two different substances, so light rays will bend. Why does light, when entering the water, not maintain its original direction and bend? This seems to be a mysterious thing. If you observe and experiment carefully, you can get satisfactory results."

"Then how can I experiment to recognize the path that light rays take and the phenomenon of bending? And light rays are colorless, tasteless, and odorless, so it's really not easy to experiment or observe." After Xi-er finished speaking, he saw his brother take a piece of tablecloth and a threadless spool (the kind of spool used for sewing clothes that can roll). Zong-er first covered half of the table with the tablecloth, and then said, "Let's use this toy as an example of the bending of light rays." As he spoke, he tilted the table and rolled the spool down from a high place. The spool was slanted, and as it moved to the edge of the tablecloth, it bent and traveled over the tablecloth. Zong-er continued to say, "This is because there is a difference in speed at the boundary. It is clear that the speed of movement on the table is greater, and when it moves to the cloth-covered part, which has a slower speed, the spool bends. The spool represents the light ray. From this experiment, we can observe the phenomenon of light bending. We can also answer why bending occurs. In short, the speed of light in air and water is different, so bending occurs. If the difference in speed is greater, the bending will be greater. If the spool rolled straight to the edge of the tablecloth, it would not bend. This phenomenon can also be compared to an army marching. If a line of soldiers is proceeding from flat, hard ground to uneven ground, it will definitely reduce its speed, because it must bypass the difficult-to-walk roads and tend to the flat road. The path taken by light rays is exactly similar to the situation of marching."

### A Load of Cotton, A Load of Iron

— Bai Shui

One Saturday evening, father, mother, older brother, and younger brother were all gathered together in a room, urging their father to tell a story. However, their father thought and thought, but couldn't come up with one. Suddenly, the older brother exclaimed, "Father hasn't thought of a story yet, but I have a question. Whoever can answer it has the greatest ability." Upon hearing this, the younger brother eagerly asked what the question was. The older brother said, "Which is heavier, a load of cotton or a load of iron?" Without a moment's thought, the younger brother replied, "Iron is heavier."

The mother, who was listening nearby, smiled and said, "Silly child, you fell for your brother's trick! A load is one hundred catties, so whether it's iron or cotton, if they both weigh one hundred catties, how can one be heavier than the other?" The older brother clapped his hands and laughed, "I knew the younger brother would say iron is heavier. Today, our teacher told us that the most important thing for a scientist is to be meticulous. When faced with a problem, one shouldn't answer rashly. Our teacher said that young people tend to give quick answers to problems, but they don't consider whether they're correct or not, and that's not the attitude a scientist should have."

The younger brother, after being told this by his mother and older brother, blushed and was almost about to cry. So, the father came forward and said, "I won't tell a story. Instead, let's talk about this question! A load of cotton and a load of iron, although both are one hundred catties, do have different weights, so the younger brother's answer isn't entirely wrong. For example, it has been raining for the past few days, and the air is very humid. If you weigh one hundred catties of cotton and one hundred catties of iron, they would indeed weigh the same at that time. However, after several days of sunny weather, the previously weighed one hundred catties of cotton, after being exposed to the sun for a few days, would weigh less than one hundred catties when weighed again, while the iron would still weigh one hundred catties. Wouldn't that mean the iron is heavier than the cotton? Conversely, if you weighed one hundred catties of cotton and one hundred catties of iron on a clear day and transported them to a distant place by car, and the car encountered a rainstorm midway, the cotton would then weigh more than the iron when weighed again. Therefore, although iron and cotton both weigh one hundred catties, their weights are different due to different climates and environments. So, it wouldn't be quite right to say that the younger brother's answer is wrong."

### Black Brothers (10) (5)

— Yi Mu

At that moment, he saw all sorts of vibrant flowers blooming on the rocks. Their five different colors were dazzling, the fresh green moss accentuating the star-like pale red flowers. The gentle and lovely gentian flowers were more pleasing to the eye than the sky's azure blue, and there were white lilies, pure white as if they were transparent. Red and purple butterflies flitted about, full of life. Looking up, he also saw thousands of auspicious rays of light shooting down from the sky. Ge Le, being in such an environment, felt happier than he had ever been in his life.

However, after he climbed up the mountain for another hour, he was unbearably thirsty again. When he looked at his water bottle, there were only five or six drops of water left, and he dared not drink any more. Just as he was about to re-hang the bottle on his belt, he saw a small dog lying on a rock, panting incessantly—this dog was the very one Hans had encountered earlier when going up the mountain. Ge Le stopped in his tracks and looked at it, then glanced at the Golden River, which was less than five hundred yards away from his destination. He considered walking past the dog and continuing upward, but he heard the creature whimpering pathetically, so he stopped again. Ge Le felt immense sympathy for it and said to himself, "Poor creature, if I don't help it now, it will surely die when I come down later." As he looked at the dog more closely, he saw the extreme misery in its eyes, making it unbearable for him to look any further. He stomped his foot and exclaimed loudly, "Damn the king of the Golden River! I absolutely don't want his gold!" Then, he removed the bottle's stopper and poured the remaining holy water into the dog's mouth.

The dog jumped up and stood on its hind legs like a human. In an instant, its tail disappeared, its ears gradually grew longer, shimmering like silk or the glow of the Golden River, its nose turned bright red, and its eyes gleamed. In just a few seconds, the dog was gone, and standing before Ge Le was his old friend—the king of the Golden River.

The king said to Ge Le, "Thank you, but don't be alarmed by this. You did the right thing." Originally, Ge Le thought that his loud curses just now must have been heard by the king's family, so he couldn't help feeling somewhat apprehensive, which showed on his face. The king of the Golden River continued, "Why didn't you come sooner? You let those two detestable brothers of yours come, forcing me to put in extra effort to turn them into rocks. They have become very hard rocks."

### Interludes in "Liang Hongyu"

— Deng Erjing

The interludes in a drama must consider the effect of the drama; even a folk song should be inserted appropriately. Therefore, Gu Zhongyi carefully noted the intended purpose of each lyric in "Liang Hongyu." In terms of musical composition, one must also consider the performer's technique and various other difficulties. As a result, the interludes are attached to the play and cannot be appreciated purely from a musical standpoint.

The first song here is sung by prostitutes when their masters are drinking and making merry. Even "lascivious tunes" are acceptable, but due to the constraints of the lyrics and form, the music is written in the style of a folk song, with the task of enlivening the atmosphere left entirely to the singers and instrumentalists. It is not expected that the audience will imitate this way of singing.

The second song is sung by Liang Hongyu while dancing with a sword at the prince's command. The lyrics consist of three verses, with the meaning progressing from sorrowful to indignant, which moves Han Shizhong to draw his sword and dance and sing along.

A man should be determined to join the army, to kill all the barbarian bandits and protect our homeland!

The third song is sung by soldiers and civilians while building the city wall. The rhythm is distinct, like a march. It is sung in three verses. Although the melody is simple, the lyrics are enough to alert those who are still dreaming. Therefore, the lyrics are recorded at the end of this article.

"The wind blows, the rain falls, thunder and lightning bring forth sea dragons, breaking the walls, destroying the nests, houses shaking, shaking, unstable, afraid they will collapse, the whole family's lives are at stake! As long as the brothers are of one mind, we fear neither wind nor dragons, as long as we endure hardship and bear labor, we will protect our home with united hearts!

The wind blows, the rain falls, the cruel jackals attack the Song Dynasty, seizing our land, killing our compatriots, trampling on our China, Qin, Yan, Qi, Zhao, the country's fate is at stake. As long as the brothers are of one mind, we fear neither jackals nor leopards, as long as we are determined to fight to the end, we will protect our country with united hearts!

Horns blow, drums beat, the men of the whole country raise their arms and shout, we will not return to the court until we eliminate the barbarian bandits, we will recover our Central Plains and strike straight into the enemy's lair, we will cut the grass and eliminate the roots without mercy! The people of the whole country are of one mind, seeking life in death is true glory, knowing that when the country is broken, where can the home be safe, we will protect our country with united hearts!"

### Technique and Soul

— Ti Gong

The play "Wen Ruyu" was performed by the Yifeng Drama Society two years ago for forty-two consecutive days. I watched it no fewer than ten times. The audience's opinion was quite satisfactory. However, I felt a bit strange at the time. It was a great tragedy, yet I had watched it so many times without shedding a single tear. Although I had been moved when reading the script, Jin Zhong'er, who played the most important role at the climax of the play, had a technique that was quite skillful and rich, as if she had achieved everything we had hoped for.

During the Qingming Festival this year, the Yifeng Society performed "Wen Ruyu" once again during the daytime. After watching it, I suddenly couldn't restrain my emotions, so I wrote down some thoughts. The following week, the Yifeng Society posted the play again. I asked Xinfang why they were performing this play, which had been shelved for so long, twice in a row. Xinfang smiled and said that it was specially requested by Mr. Hu, probably because he had seen my article. However, the performance that day was indeed unprecedented since "Wen Ruyu" had been performed. During the climax of the scene between Jin Zhong'er and Ruyu in the courtyard, the handkerchiefs of the ladies in the audience fluttered like snowflakes, and even the gentlemen were busy secretly wiping away tears with their fingers behind their backs.

This comparison made me deeply realize that an actor cannot rely solely on their technique. They must understand the playwright's psychology. When performing, they must forget themselves, put the soul of the character created by the playwright in the script into their own body, and completely transform themselves into that particular character. Only then can they arouse empathy from the audience and be considered an artist. If they only have technique and no soul, they are, at best, an artisan. The success of this performance of "Wen Ruyu" was because Jin Zhong'er on stage had already put Jin Jie's soul into her own body.

If there are those who have watched "Wen Ruyu" but have not shed tears, they may wish to watch it again to witness the significant influence of technique and soul on the effect of the play.

### Wang Xichun

— Hai Sheng

Conversations after Returning to Shanghai

Wang Xichun, the "Little Island Wang Xichun," has been in Hong Kong for over a month. Yesterday, she and her mother returned to Shanghai on the Debao Steamer. Originally, the small steamer was supposed to dock at the new customs wharf at two o'clock, where her father, Wang Jinrong, Ms. Zheng, Gong Jichuan, Wu Shan, reporters, and her younger siblings were waiting to welcome them. However, the ship didn't dock until 3:15. She was wearing a green cheongsam and a gray short coat. Upon seeing us, she smiled and waved. She was still as charming and lively as ever, but perhaps due to the fatigue of the journey and the sea breeze, her face was dark and thin.

I asked her how the performances were going there. She said, "The first half of the month was very good, but the second half was worse. Even Cantonese opera there rarely lasts more than ten days, let alone a month." Her father asked, "After apprenticing with Mr. Mei, what plays did he tell you to rehearse?" She replied, "The teacher often came to watch the plays and gave instructions at any time, pointing out how certain parts should be sung or acted." As she said this, she showed me a plum blossom painting that Mei Lanfang had drawn and given to her, inscribed with the words, "Xichun asks for guidance from me, and as she is about to return north, I have painted this for her." Finally, she smiled and told me that she learned to paint every day in Hong Kong and had painted many plum blossoms to give away.

As an aside, the film tycoon Wu Xingzai returned to Shanghai yesterday on the Zhibade Steamer, arriving an hour earlier than Xichun, but he had left a day earlier.

### News from the Opera World

Mao Jianqiu, the Kunqu actress who performed with lavishness, has resigned due to pregnancy and cannot continue performing. It is rumored that Yu Sulian has been invited to fill the position, but according to reporters, the two sides are still in negotiations and no agreement has been reached. It is expected that a resolution will be reached in four or five days.

Yang Baotong, the veteran Wusheng (martial male role) of the Tianchan Stage, is scheduled to marry the elder sister of Wusheng Yu Zongying on the seventeenth day of the fourth lunar month. The wedding hall will be located at the Yuebao Restaurant. This year, the opera world in Shanghai is full of joy.

Twenty Kinds of Suzhou Ballads

### (5) Legend of the White Snake

— Written by Dongyun, Illustrated by Xiuyan

The Legend of the White Snake is the story of "The White Maiden Repaying Kindness," which is widely circulated among women. Some people thought that the title "Legend of the White Snake" was not suitable for the times, so they changed it to "The Grievances of Leifeng Pagoda"—the protagonist, Bai Suzhen, was imprisoned at the bottom of the Xiaofeng Pagoda for eighteen years because of "Flooding Jinshan Temple."

"Bai Suzhen is said to be a white snake that has attained enlightenment; the maid Xiaoqing is a green snake; Bai had received great kindness from Xu Xuan in a previous life, so she transformed into a woman and dedicated herself to Xu Xuan to repay his kindness." This story is quite absurd, but fortunately, we are just "speaking nonsense and listening to nonsense."

### Japan's Southward Advance Without a Clear Target

— Xin

Attacking the Dutch East Indies is a Diplomatic Probe, No Chance of Success under Anglo-American Surveillance, Southward Advance Dream

The slogan of Japan's southward advance policy has been shouted for many years, but it has no definite meaning and only represents a bizarre fantasy. Some believe that the origin of this fantasy is that the Japanese army wants to use it to raise its status, but this does not conflict with the fantasies of the Japanese army. The army's fantasies are already bizarre, crossing northern China to Persia, and crossing southern China to India, which have long been within their calculations. The former plan was somewhat restrained by international opposition, but this is a more distant and difficult road in the Great Asian Dream, and the hope of continuing to walk it is becoming less and less, so this part of the dream may no longer continue in reality. The latter plan, if it succeeds, will become a force driving the navy southward, and if it fails, it will still be a voice supporting the navy's southward advance. It seems that there are still opportunities to wait for, and during the waiting period, the navy's southward advance atmosphere should be released for testing.

Germany and Japan

The target of the probe is to resolve which side it should join in the European war. Superficially, Japan, which has always been regarded as a maritime power, should have a pivotal position between the two sides. It should be able to create opportunities, not just wait for them, but in fact, neither side gives it a chance to express its attitude, and it has almost been reduced to a non-essential position, so it can only wait in the end. The news that Germany will attack the Netherlands has made the Dutch East Indies a problem. It waits for the first opportunity, but the center of gravity is still on whether Germany will attack the Netherlands. On this point, Germany does not seem to feel the need to give Japan a hint, and on the contrary. Germany may also feel that if it attacks the Netherlands and the Dutch East Indies fall into the hands of Japan or Britain, it would be more unfavorable to itself than leaving them in the hands of a neutral Netherlands. The rumor that Germany will attack the Netherlands is already the third time, and the first two times were known to be propaganda from the British and French sides. This time it is still propaganda from the British and French sides, and it is also very likely. If so, the opportunity that Japan will use is just a strategy arranged by the British and French sides. Britain and France want to test the possibility of Japan joining the German side, and Japan has been tested and dare not clearly express this tendency. Although this is also leaving a way out, it is enough to show its lack of strength.

The Complex Relationship of the South Seas

Not only is it being tested whether Japan will truly advance southward, but it seems that tests are also being carried out to see if it can be forced to retreat further. This role is played by the United States. Japan must advance further south to conflict with Britain and France, but the current degree of southward advance has already surrounded the Philippines. Naturally, the goals of the United States are slightly different from those of Britain and France. Micronesia, which Japan administers on behalf of the United Nations, blocks the traffic between Honolulu and the Philippines. In particular, the important islands of Micronesia, Mariana and Palau, tightly control Guam and Yap Island, which the United States can never feel at ease about. In addition, on March 30 last year, Japan occupied the Tuan Sha Islands in the South China Sea, and on April 18, it extended to include the Xisha Islands. The significance of these islands lies purely in that they can be used as naval and air force bases. Although they are as close to Saigon and Sandakan as they are to Manila, the Philippines is close to Taiwan and sandwiched between Micronesia and the Tuan Sha Islands, which is more unfavorable than the British and French territories. Moreover, the defense of Britain and France can only be centered on Singapore. For the easternmost part of the Malay Archipelago, such as the Moluccas and New Guinea, they may not be able to take care of it all, while Japan has always paid attention to this direction and has repeatedly proposed buying Dutch New Guinea. If it cannot obtain it by trickery, it may eventually resort to forceful seizure, which will further create a situation of encircling the Philippines on all sides, which the United States naturally cannot help but curb.

Probing the United States

Although the west coast of Central China is a better target, the defense of the New Guinea area is obviously weaker, and looking at the map, this area is closer to Japan's administered territory and is directly south of Japan. The port of Darwin in Australia is on the same longitude as Nagasaki, and Port Moresby is on the same longitude as Tokyo. Japan is no farther from Australia than it is from Java. Japan may still turn to this side. Turning to this side and involving the United States will naturally encounter greater difficulties, but what great strength the United States declares it has prepared behind it is still something that Japan wants to test. But it does not conduct tests in this area, which further proves that it does not dare to advance southward on the Singapore side.

### The Future of the Dutch East Indies: A Treasure of the World, A Target of Attack, Where is the Dutch East Indies Going

The Netherlands and Portugal were both important colonial countries in the early modern period, and in modern times, they both have vast colonies with small homelands. In terms of homeland, Portugal is larger, and in terms of colonies, Portugal is also more extensive, but in terms of national strength, Portugal is far inferior to the Netherlands. The reason for this difference can be said to be entirely because the Netherlands possesses the world's richest East Indies archipelago.

The United States and the Dutch East Indies

The essence of the Dutch East Indies lies in Java (including Madura). Java's area accounts for only one-seventh of the total area of the Dutch East Indies, while its population accounts for seven-tenths of the total area of the Dutch East Indies, that is, an area of 50,752 square miles and a population of 41,719,000. Compared with Zhejiang Province in China, the area is slightly equal and the population is twice that of Zhejiang, compared with the two islands of England and Scotland, the population is slightly equal, and the area is only half of the two islands of England and Scotland. Cuba in North America is similar to it in terms of situation and shape, with an area of nine-tenths of it and a population of only one-tenth of it. Therefore, Cuba's import and export trade is similar to Java's, but in terms of production, it is not comparable to Java. Cuba is already the pearl of the Caribbean Sea, and the preciousness of Java is simply indescribable. Theodore Roosevelt did not hesitate to launch the Spanish-American War for Cuba. This historical fact may be stimulating Franklin Roosevelt's heart, so in the current situation where German-Dutch relations are becoming increasingly tense, the United States has already boasted about protecting the Dutch East Indies. The final outcome of this event is still far away, but if the United States protects Greenland, it would have used the same method to deal with the Dutch East Indies.

Britain and the Dutch East Indies

On the other hand, Britain is not willing to be left behind in expressing its sense of righteousness to protect it, and has also issued a declaration. The Dutch themselves have declared that the East Indies themselves have the strength to protect themselves. Historical relations make us often feel that the Dutch East Indies is closer to Europe, but in fact London is 8,000 miles away from Batavia, while Los Angeles is only 7,000 miles away from Batavia. Los Angeles is only 7,500 miles away from Sydney, Australia, while London is 12,500 miles away from Sydney. Naturally, in the phenomenon of actual competition, the difference in distance is irrelevant, but this is very much a reason for the United States to believe that it has a deep relationship with them.

Japan and the Dutch East Indies

Japan, under the slogan of "Asia for Asians," is naturally also interested, but how it will deal with this problem cannot be accurately estimated. Alone against the United States, it can take a posture of fighting for the right to protect, but for Britain, it also needs to consider whether it is more worthwhile to take the name of joint protection. Naturally, in fact, the opponents it can compete with are the opposite, but under the situation of testing, the methods used are quite different. On its side, Britain's fight for the right to protect can be interpreted as a rejection of the United States as an hint to court it, and if the United States does not react much to this, its fantasy can indeed continue for quite some time, until Britain cannot take care of the East.

### The Malay Peninsula as a British Imperial Defense Fortress

— Yu

The Malay Peninsula, located at the southernmost tip of Asia between China and India, extends 464 miles from the Siamese border in the north to Singapore in the south, and does not exceed 216 miles in width from the China Sea in the east to the Strait of Malacca in the west. Although its area is truly insignificant in the British Empire, it has three different statuses in its political organization. For example, Singapore, Penang, Malacca, and Labuan Island are directly administered colonies of the British Empire, collectively known as the Straits Settlements. Perak, Selangor, Negeri Sembilan, and Pahang form the Federated Malay States. Johor, Kedah, Kelantan, Terengganu, and Perlis are the Unfederated Malay States. These many places are all headed by the governor of the Straits Settlements.

British contact with the Malay Peninsula dates back to 1600. It gradually became a British colony after 1824, when Stamford Raffles of the East India Company made a treaty with the Kingdom of Johor. The Federation was established in 1895. Although the other five states did not join the Federation, they were also under British protection. After a century of operation, Singapore, which is located at the southernmost tip of the Malay Peninsula and is of extreme military importance, has become one of the world's twelve major ports. It is not only a fortress defending the Malay Peninsula, but also a breakwater for Australia, New Zealand, and the East Indies.

The political leaders of various places in the Malay Peninsula have also contributed greatly to the construction of the Singapore naval base. The Federated Malay States donated £2 million several years ago for the construction of a naval base. When former British King George V celebrated the twenty-fifth anniversary of his accession to the throne, the Sultan of Johor donated £500,000, and even the poorest Kelantan donated £20,000. The total amount reached £1.5 million. It can be seen that the natives of the Malay Peninsula have also contributed no small amount of effort.

### National Goods Forum: The Financial World and National Goods Industries

— Bai

The development of Shanghai's national goods industry is certainly due to the efforts of national entrepreneurs themselves, but the assistance of the financial world to national goods factories over the years is also an undeniable contribution. After all, any factory that relies solely on its limited funds for operation, without the assistance of the financial world, will often find its business development limited by capital and unable to cope. Therefore, the financial world is to the national goods industry as water is to fish and green leaves are to peonies. The survival and development of the national goods industry truly depends on it.

As world warfare intensifies and foreign goods become unavailable, the demand for national goods from domestic and foreign customers has also increased with the anti-Japanese sentiment. This is truly a golden opportunity for the development of national goods. However, with the Sino-Japanese War in full swing, transportation in the interior is difficult, the source of raw materials is cut off, and the difficulty of transportation and sales is increasing. Meanwhile, the domestic and foreign markets' demand for national goods has increased several times over. To achieve mass production, national goods factories must increase their strength to cope. This is why the government has issued orders to the four banks to implement industrial loans as much as possible. I, as a reporter, have previously suggested using surplus floating capital to invest in national goods factories. I believe that there is a great deal of floating capital accumulated in Shanghai banks, and the enthusiasm of Shanghai financiers for loving their country and safeguarding industry has always been praised by the nation. In this era of thriving national industry, they should spare no effort to promote industrial loans to support the government's intention to promote industry. Although there are many ways to use funds at present, for the sake of supporting the national policy of resistance and reconstruction, nothing is more important than assisting national goods factories to produce as much as possible to meet market demand. If national factories have complete equipment but lack sufficient working capital to cope with the current special situation and engage in mass production, or if they are industries with great promise but need to strengthen their foundation, the financial world may wish to provide assistance within its capacity. Safeguarding national enterprises is a concrete manifestation of the financial world's support for the national policy of resistance and reconstruction. I know that the Shanghai financial community, which has always been known for safeguarding national industry and supporting the national policy of resistance and reconstruction, understands the direction of future efforts without needing my repeated urging.

### Introduction to National Goods Factories: Daily Hygiene Necessities - The Manufacturing Process of "Double Ten" Brand Toothbrushes - "Not a Single Hair Pulled, Guarantee Replacement" - Outstanding Reputation

— Zhong Wangshu

Since the eastward spread of European trends, Chinese people have become accustomed to modern and rational daily hygiene practices, such as brushing teeth, which is now extremely common. Toothbrushes are the main tool for brushing teeth. China initially did not produce them, but as demand increased, imported products became very expensive. Seeing this, Liang Rixin and Liang Risheng, brothers from Foshan, Guangdong, raised capital to start a home-based handmade toothbrush factory in their hometown three years before the founding of the Republic of China. At that time, they only rented a small shop on Shengping Street in the town as a distribution point. Because their products had the advantage of "not a single hair pulled, guaranteed replacement," they were very popular among the public. After hard work, their business gradually prospered, and to this day, branch factories have been established all over the country and abroad, and their products are sold far and wide in Southeast Asia, Europe, and the United States, becoming a giant in the domestic toothbrush industry. The Liang brothers' spirit of hard work, perseverance, and courage is truly the key to their success. The factory's development from its humble beginnings to its current large scale is a valuable reference and model for those engaged in the daily necessities industry. Therefore, I am happy to introduce it in this publication.

Brief History

A handmade factory was established in Foshan three years before the founding of the Republic of China, with a small output. After the revolution, sales soared, so production was increased to meet the needs of the Chinese people. A branch was established in Hong Kong's Dog Lane to promote products overseas and find a way out for national goods. In March of the ninth year of the Republic of China, General Manager Liang Risheng and Manager Chen Bingxia arrived in Shanghai and established the Shanghai General Branch. At the same time, a toothbrush factory was established in Guangzhou to ensure a steady supply for the various branches in their sales efforts. In the fourteenth year of the Republic of China, a mechanized toothbrush factory was established on Doulou Road in Ximen, and since then, the product styles have been innovative and refined, surpassing imported products. As of August 13th, there were a total of four toothbrush factories and fifteen distribution points in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Foshan, Hankou, and Suzhou, providing livelihoods for more than 5,000 workers.

After August 13th, some factories moved to the interior. A new factory was established on Dazhi Road in Hankou. During the Battle of Wuhan, it moved westward to Chongqing and established the Sixth Branch on the banks of the Jialing River. As for the two toothbrush factories in Ximen and Kunming Road in Shanghai, they were all moved into the concessions under difficult circumstances. At the end of the twenty-sixth year, a new general factory was rebuilt at No. A97 Xujiahui Road, producing an average of more than 10,000 toothbrushes per day. Before August 13th, sales covered all provinces and ports across the country. After the war, focus shifted to Southeast Asia and the Americas, because overseas Chinese love to use national goods, and foreign exchange is tight, making it easier to promote to foreigners. Overseas orders already exceed supply. The turnover in the ninth year of the Republic of China was only more than 20,000 yuan, but now it has exceeded 2 million yuan. The degree of progress is evident from this.

Manufacturing

1. Raw Materials: The main raw materials for toothbrush manufacturing are cow bones and pig bristles. Cow bones are produced in Sichuan, Hubei, Jiangsu, Shandong, Guangdong, and other provinces in China, which normally meet the demand. After the war, due to transportation difficulties, raw materials suddenly became scarce. The cow bones currently used by various toothbrush factories include domestic products and some American products. Pig bristles are produced in Sichuan, Hubei, Hunan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangdong, and other provinces, with those from Sichuan being the best. Now, because the national government controls exports, the cost of raw materials has soared to more than seven times the original price, and the cost of toothbrush manufacturing has increased accordingly. Horse bristles are used to make toothbrushes only for the use of Muslim compatriots, while elephant bristles are rarely used due to their high price.

2. Procedures: The toothbrush manufacturing process is extremely complex, requiring more than eighteen steps: 1. Determining Length: Cutting cow bones of different lengths to the length required for the toothbrush handle. 2. Splitting Bone: Splitting the whole cow bone into several pieces. 3. Shaping Bone: Shaping the split cow bones. 4. Grinding Blank: Grinding the shaped cow bones into handle blanks. 5. Drilling Holes and Water Holes: Drilling holes for bristles and water drainage. 6. Aligning Holes: Aligning the drilled holes. 7. Grinding Head: Grinding the handle head into the desired shape. 8. Grinding Neck: Grinding the handle neck into the desired shape. 9. Opening Groove: Opening a water groove where the bristles are to be inserted. 10. Drilling Nail Holes: Drilling holes on the handle. 11. Bleaching and Disinfection: Bleaching and disinfecting the bone handle. 12. Polishing: Applying paint and polishing the bleached handle. 13. Inserting Bristles: Inserting the pig bristles. 14. Securing Head: Securing the inserted bristles. 15. Trimming: Trimming the lines of the inserted bristles. 16. Cutting Bristles: Trimming the inserted bristles to the desired height and angle. 17. Clamping: Clamping the bristles into sections. 18. Stamping: Stamping with a steel stamp mark. A complete toothbrush is thus completed. Steps 1 to 13 above are done by machine, while steps 14 to 18 are done by hand. Division of labor and cooperation make manufacturing very fast. If all the steps were done by machine, it would save even more time and labor. According to the person in charge of the factory, when orders are rushed, they manufacture day and night, and can produce more than 20,000 toothbrushes per day.

### National Goods News

In the past week, managers of national goods companies from various places have come to Shanghai to purchase various national goods. The demand for national goods in the interior has greatly increased, but unfortunately, transportation difficulties are a serious obstacle to the transportation and sale of national goods to the interior.

With the outbreak of the war, industries moved inland, and the construction of industries in the inland provinces is also progressing day by day. According to recent investigations, wool weaving, rubber, cotton spinning, chemical industry, and other factories have been successively established in the interior. "The war has destroyed industries in the coastal areas and promoted the construction of industries in the interior. It is difficult to say whether this war is a blessing or a curse for China."

Chinese industrialist Liu Hongsheng has opened a large-scale Chinese wool textile factory in Chongqing. It is said that the machinery has been purchased and will be put into operation this autumn.

The Chongqing branch of Tianyuan Electrochemical Plant was put into operation in Chongqing on the 10th of this month. From then on, the important industrial raw materials needed in the southwest regions can be supplied by the factory.

### New Clothes and Western Suits

— Junqing

"New clothes" are Western suits for women, and Western suits are "new clothes" for men. Both can be said to be the most fashionable and modern attire in this great era. Modern men and women, in this spring scenery like brocade, one with a handsome youthful appearance, and the other with a graceful demeanor, can indeed evoke a lot of envy.

The Dachangxiang Silk and Satin Store on Nanjing Road has a huge amount of wool fabrics and domestically produced textiles with novel patterns for new clothes. In terms of work, there is a self-established workshop for direct command and expert tailoring. Hundreds of new coats are produced every day. To expand the Western suit business, highly skilled technicians have been specially hired to be responsible for supervision. For Chinese-style clothes, a custom-made clothing department has already been established to supervise the production of men's and women's clothing on schedule. Recently, to meet the general urgent needs, they have pioneered express clothing, which can be delivered in three hours after being commissioned. This kind of trend-following action also shows Dachangxiang's serious service.

### Wancheng Industrial Company

Wancheng Industrial Company produces Meijiajing floor wax and stain remover. With excellent quality, the floors, bathrooms, kitchens, and furniture in modern homes will immediately become bright and new after using the company's products. They are sold in major stores.

### Automatic Toothpaste Tube Filling Machine - Only One in the Country - Also Rare in Europe and America

The Sanxing toothpaste produced by China Chemical Industry Company has a history of more than 20 years. With excellent quality and large sales volume, it can be called a giant in the domestic toothpaste industry. In recent years, production has increased sharply. The company is also striving for perfection in mechanical equipment. The automatic toothpaste tube filling machine (see picture) does not require manual labor and can automatically fill and seal tubes, meeting the requirements of cleanliness and hygiene. This machine is the most advanced manufactured in the United States and is worth more than 100,000 yuan. Not only is it the only one in the country, but it is also rare in Europe, truly a new and sharp tool for manufacturing toothpaste.

### China Underwear Company

Newly launched A·B·C·shirts and trousers, light and resilient material, comfortable and close-fitting, washable and durable, meeting economic conditions, in this time of rising living costs, it can help solve clothing problems.

### National Goods News: Ministry of Economic Affairs Revises Provisional Standards for National Goods

Regarding the standards for national goods, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce had detailed regulations before the war. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the Ministry of Economic Affairs was established, and the standards for national goods were revised, still divided into principles for national goods and standards for national goods.

1. Principles for National Goods

1.
