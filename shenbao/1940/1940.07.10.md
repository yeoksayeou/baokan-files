Editorial

### China's International Environment

In yesterday's newspaper commentary, we attempted the most objective analysis of the Monroe Doctrine articulated by the American authorities the day before. Without elaboration, we hoped that the analysis was not flawed. We regretted that the telecommunications provided were not sufficiently detailed or concrete, because we speculated that the American authorities' articulation was actively constructive in their subjective view, but its meaning could easily give one the impression that there were some ambiguities implied. Yesterday, we received another telegram from Washington in which Secretary of State Hull earnestly stated that American foreign policy remained unchanged, and indirectly criticized the so-called Monroe Doctrine in Europe and Asia as "a pretext for armed conquest". Thus, the ambiguities were clarified by this statement. This is the aspect of China's current international environment that we are pleased to highlight first today!

Originally, the sum of a country's own operations and efforts in various aspects can only determine a part of its destiny, and another part is affected and controlled by the international environment. From another point of view, a country's efforts can change its international environment; at the same time, the evolution of the international situation often expands or reduces its achievements due to the operations and efforts of a certain country. Under this major premise, a comprehensive view of China's current international environment is actually the total number produced by the mutual addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of the main internal and external factors over the past three years.

From comprehensive observation to analysis: the objective role of China's War of Resistance in the international situation should first be recognized. This has been clearly indicated in the recent message to friendly countries and the message to the people issued by China's Supreme Commander: that is, the success or failure of China's war actually affects the future welfare and lasting peace of all mankind. This is indeed an insightful view, a word to the point. We must also admit that the sympathy and assistance given to China by people all over the world since the War of Resistance have all been based on this fundamental understanding. The heroism of China's three-year War of Resistance has had a significant impact on the overall international situation. Roughly speaking, there are at least four points: (1) It has not gone beyond the core of Europe; (2) From three years ago to the present, although those who have been defeated have been defeated, the flame of just resistance has always been maintained; (3) It has eased or even eliminated the contradictions and struggles of a wider range and more destructive global ideologies; (4) It has curbed the attempts of those who yearn for Eastern dictatorship. No one can deny that these four points are the greatest contribution of China's War of Resistance to the international situation, and that it has indeed fulfilled its most sacred mission to human civilization. This is not an exaggeration of China's War of Resistance, but please imagine what serious encounters European and American countries, whether Britain and France, or Germany and Italy, or the United States and the Soviet Union, would now be facing in the Far East if China had not resisted until now?

Secondly, please examine all aspects of the impact of China's international environment: first, Sino-British relations. Before China's War of Resistance, Britain was the leader of imperialism, and China was a rich semi-colonial country. According to common sense and common sense, there must be serious contradictions between the two. What about now? China has created its new life and is no longer a semi-colonial country because it takes striving for international freedom and equality as the main reason for the War of Resistance; as for Britain, it is also engaged in a bloody battle for the existence of the British Empire itself. For the sake of the safety of its interests in the Far East during and after the war, Britain needs China's friendship and cooperation. In order to achieve the victory of the War of Resistance and the completion of national construction, China needs the help of various countries, and Britain is one of the important countries among them. Secondly, please talk about Sino-US relations. Since China's War of Resistance, especially since the outbreak of the European War last year, everyone has noticed two eye-catching phenomena in the United States' foreign policy and public opinion: although aid to Britain and France is many times greater than aid to China, generally speaking, the tendency of the US government to not hesitate to go to war is greater in the Far East than in Europe; Moreover, the general public opinion in the United States is quite divergent and contradictory on who is right and wrong on both sides of the European belligerents, but for the Far East, they unanimously sympathize with China and condemn Japan. There is also a special phenomenon on the Chinese side, that is, although the actual assistance given to China by the United States in the past three years is not the most compared with other friendly countries, the Chinese authorities and people have psychologically regarded the United States as the most reliable friend from beginning to end, and their eyes have always been looking across the Pacific. These special eye-catching phenomena are the result of the hard work of the authorities and social figures of China and the United States over the past few decades; therefore, in the psychology of the two nations, this deeply rooted, mutually close tendency has been cast. We firmly believe that there is a closer future for China and the United States, and we firmly believe that this closeness is the most rational and humane leaven in the international community. Thirdly, please talk about Sino-Soviet relations. The Soviet Union must be aware that the enemy chosen by Japan is either China or the Soviet Union; therefore, only China's War of Resistance will prevent Japan from starting a war with the Soviet Union again; therefore, among the countries affected by the Sino-Japanese War, the Soviet Union has the greatest direct interest. Indeed, the Soviet Union has provided the most actual assistance to China in the past three years; and the possibility for friendly countries to obtain real assistance to China is also the strongest in the Soviet Union. This is not a view of love or hate, but a comparison of facts. Fourthly, please talk about countries other than the United States, the Soviet Union, and Britain: China's attitude towards France; disappointed but sympathetic; France's attitude towards China, sympathetic but ashamed. China trusts that Germany has no political intentions in the Far East and expects Germany to develop its culture and commerce in a moderate manner; as for Germany's attitude towards China, the era of almost painfully sacrificing Sino-German friendship for the sake of the European situation and international politics has completely passed, but the act of actively promoting Sino-German friendship still awaits the arrival of the era.

In summary, China's international environment is indeed full of hope and optimism; this is the achievement of being able to resist for three years, and continuing the War of Resistance will surely reap its satisfactory results!

Chongqing: The Executive Yuan held its 472nd meeting on the afternoon of the 9th, at which it discussed the issue of grain supply in Chongqing and decided on several principles for the supply method. The remaining cases are selected as follows: (1) Vice President Kong proposed that Lebbeus Fonder be commended for his efforts in handling relief work, which resulted in his death due to overwork. Resolution: Request the National Government to issue a decree of commendation. (Original text of the proposal attached later) (2) The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs reviewed the report and drafted an adjustment plan for local trade agencies. Please indicate. Resolution: Revised and passed. (3) The Ministry of Education submitted a proposal to approve the establishment of a special department and rename the Central Industrial Vocational School, which was established by the league, as the National Central Industrial Specialized Vocational School. Please approve. Resolution: Passed. (4) The Ministry of Education submitted a proposal to commend Zhengzhong Bookstore for voluntarily contributing all the copyright of textbooks during the War of Resistance for the use of this edition, so that provinces and cities can imitate and print them. Resolution: Passed. (5) The Ministry of Health submitted a proposal to set up four mobile health teams in provinces such as Xikang and compile a plan. Please indicate. Resolution: Passed. Appointments and Removals: (1) The President proposed that Shi Zizhou, member of the Hubei Provincial Government and Director of the Education Department, should be relieved of his positions due to other appointments. Zhang Bojin was appointed to succeed him. Resolution: Passed. (2) The President proposed to appoint Liao Wanbang and Liu Xuchu as members of the Shandong Provincial Government. Resolution: Passed. (3) The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry requested the appointment of Zhang Yuanfeng as Director of the Department of Agricultural Affairs, Li Shunqing as Director of the Department of Forestry, Zhao Baoquan as Director of the Department of Rural Economy, Cheng Shaohui as Director of the Department of Fisheries, and Liu Yunchou as Counselor. Resolution: Passed. (Appendix to the original text of the proposal) It is found that Lebbeus Fonder was originally from Belgium and has been preaching in China for many years. Because he admired Chinese culture, he changed to Chinese nationality. He founded charitable undertakings in Tianjin and other places and established Chinese news agencies. His views were fair and impartial, and he has long been valued by Chinese society. During the current Anti-Japanese War, he organized relief teams, supervised the people in North China, and engaged in relief work, which achieved great results. Recently, he went deep into difficult areas and died due to overwork. Among the naturalized people, Lebbeus Fonder was loyal and diligent. It is really rare and valuable. It seems that he should be commended to show merit. This is what we should do. I request a public decision. (Dispatch of the 9th)

### After the British Reply Was Delivered to Japan, Japanese Newspapers Were Highly Critical; If Britain Does Not Reconsider the Reply, Japan Will Take More Drastic Measures

Tokyo: Yesterday, the Japanese government asked Britain to reconsider its reply to Japan's request to block the China-Burma Road and prevent the transportation of arms to Chongqing. Today, Japanese newspapers said that the reply delivered by Britain yesterday was "a flat refusal" of Japan's request and said that if Britain does not reconsider its attitude, the Japanese government will be forced to take "effective and appropriate measures". Japanese Foreign Minister Arita yesterday asked British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie to ask the British government to reconsider its reply. This request from Japan was launched a few hours after the long-awaited British reply was delivered by the British Ambassador to the Japanese Foreign Ministry. The Tokyo "Daily News" recently stated that if Britain refuses to reconsider its reply, Britain should be responsible for what happens afterwards. "Hochi News" also asked Britain to reflect and said that senior Japanese army, navy, and foreign officials were discussing the implementation of "appropriate measures", unless Britain reflects on its position, these measures will be adopted. "Asahi Shimbun" warned that if Britain's second reply is still no different from the first, Japan will take more drastic measures. The newspaper also advocated limiting the British reply to a "considerable period". "Kokumin Shimbun" advocated that the Japanese government should limit the British reply to arrive in Tokyo on a fixed date. The newspaper said that yesterday's British reply was a direct rejection of Japan's request, but it was outwardly adorned with beautiful diplomatic rhetoric. The newspaper also believed that Britain's note had an attitude hostile to Japan, which was a sign of arousing anti-British movements among the Japanese people again. The newspaper also said that the Japanese people may ask the Japanese Foreign Minister, who is trying to avoid friction with Britain and the United States, to revise his foreign policy to adapt to the new international situation. It should be known that Britain and the United States have gradually leaned towards the Soviet Union. "Miyako Shimbun" also predicted that the second anti-British movement of the Japanese people would occur, and asked the Japanese government to revise its foreign policy. (United Press dispatch, 9th)

London: London has confirmed that British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie met with Japanese Foreign Minister Arita yesterday afternoon and handed over the British reply to Japan's request to ban the shipment of arms to Chongqing via Burma and Hong Kong. London has not yet received Craigie's report, so it is unable to comment at this time. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)

Tokyo: Asahi Shimbun said that the reason for Britain's refusal to block the Burma Road is firstly to gain the favor of the United States, because Britain wants to act in concert with the United States in the Far East, and secondly to restore its external and internal dignity lost due to the European War. Japanese Foreign Minister Arita expects that Britain will continue to send a reply within an appropriate period of time. If the tone of yesterday's reply remains unchanged, the Japanese government will adopt the second stage of a firm policy. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)

### Statement to Youth by Chairman Chiang (Continued from Yesterday)

Today, the following two conditions are most likely to ruin the future of young people: First, neglecting their fundamental work and forgetting their responsibilities and obligations to the revolution and society, thereby abandoning the near for the far, being fickle, and even being dazzled by vanity, pursuing fame and fortune, harboring a dependent and opportunistic mentality, and hoping for advancement through luck. Second, lacking a genuine examination and understanding of the current environment, harboring only resentment and complaint, forming a kind of radical and rash prejudice, and easily being swayed by enticement and incitement, inevitably leading to wavering resolve, blind obedience, and loss of rational control. Although this is due to the failure of our country's education in the past to fully guide and cultivate a solid and noble character, it is also due to the youth's own

lack of self-cultivation. Since the nation and the people place such great and pressing hope on the youth, how can our young people not severely criticize themselves and undergo a fundamental transformation? The starting point for self-criticism and transformation should begin with self-reflection and self-control as the guiding principles for self-strengthening and self-reliance. Self-reflection and self-control are inherent in the excellent virtues of our ancestors. The saying, "If you do not succeed in your actions, reflect upon yourself," is most sufficient to explain the essentials of personal conduct. Moreover, in today's world of diverse opinions and complex society, opportunists are creating novelties and those who abuse public office for personal gain show no remorse, often disregarding the national situation and indulging in their own opinions, inciting and provoking to dazzle the youth. Our youth must engage in profound self-reflection,

overcome selfishness, and exercise self-control with a calm and meticulous mind to understand the present environment and cherish their own responsibilities, so as to avoid emotional impulses and acting impulsively, and to avoid failing in life and falling into depravity. With the vigorous and enterprising spirit of our youth, coupled with the cultivation of endurance and perseverance, not fearing difficulties when facing challenges, not evading danger when faced with adversity, taking labor and service as the object of life, and taking creation and self-strengthening as the foundation of life, striving forward with perseverance, nothing is impossible, and no difficulty cannot be overcome. The thorough completion of the Three Principles of the People and the independence and liberation of the nation and the people, all these great achievements, will surely belong to the youth of China today. Zhongzheng has been engaged in the revolution for more than thirty years. Looking back at my initial motivation for participating in the revolution and my half-life of

revolutionary experience, there are things I can tell our youth. Zhongzheng joined the Tongmenghui at the age of nineteen and engaged in revolutionary work. Comrades and compatriots across the country mostly know this. However, at that time, the Tongmenghui was still in the secret era. Everything I did was not only without seeking knowledge from society, but also without waiting for the supervision of others. At that time, I had absolutely no selfish vanity, and I didn't even know what rights were. I purely had the thought of automatic creation and fulfilling the obligations of a citizen to the people and the nation. I believed that obeying the party and being listed in the party membership of the Premier's revolutionary believers was the greatest blessing in life. I believed that helping the weak and relieving the distressed, sacrificing oneself to benefit others, was the greatest joy in life. Obligations were where they should be, not needing

others' supervision, especially not seeking others' praise. Therefore, since I joined the Tongmenghui at the age of nineteen and first spoke with the Premier individually, it was not until I was twenty-seven years old, that is, at the beginning of the campaign against Yuan in the second year of the Republic. Before that, the Premier had never summoned me alone to consult me, and I had never sought to see the Premier alone, only treating myself as an ordinary party member. This spirit, from my youth to the present, has been the same for thirty years. I have always regarded myself as a revolutionary party member, only exhorting myself to strictly observe discipline and obey orders to the party and the country, only worrying about not being able to fulfill my loyalty to the doctrine and failing in my duties. In my mind, there is only the responsibility of revolution and the obligation of a party member, and there is absolutely no consideration of personal gain or loss, honor or disgrace. Because I believe that the basic conditions of a revolutionary party member should be like this, and

the attitude of a self-respecting and self-loving life should also be like this. As for my social status at that time, among the youth of the same period, the honor, status, dignity, and wealth of those far surpassed mine, how can they be counted? Even among the youth from my hometown, classmates, and contemporaries, due to the legacy of their fathers and elder brothers, or the promotion of teachers and friends, those who had deep reliance and were able to show themselves at an early age were even more incomparable to me. But looking back today, among my contemporaries who have consistently made outstanding contributions to the country and the revolution, there are not many. It can be seen that

people value self-reliance and self-strengthening. The more fortunate the success of young people who rely on their fathers, teachers, and friends, the faster their failure will be. And when they fail, they begin to realize that their previous honor and status were precisely obstacles to their success and progress. From the above, it can be seen that if the youth of China today truly want to strive to be genuine believers of the Premier and sound revolutionary fighters, they must also bury themselves in new revolutionary grassroots work, be indifferent to the concept of status, and only seek to fulfill their obligations to the stomach and society. It must be known that the only meaning of our joining the party and the group and engaging in revolution is to sacrifice oneself and fight for the country and the doctrine. All revolutionary youth should regard everyone as

unsung heroes, and everything that our obligations require us to do, everything that our responsibilities require us to fulfill, regardless of whether others fulfill them or not, we must seek peace in our own hearts. If people know it, then so be it; if people do not know it, then so be it. If the party and the country use me in this way, then so be it; if they do not encounter me, then so be it. If young people can have this beautiful virtue of not thinking about or seeking self-strengthening and self-reliance, and this spirit of practical implementation and hard work, then they will not be ashamed to be the treasure of the modern country, and they will not be ashamed to be believers of the Three Principles of the People. Even if they themselves seek nothing from the party and the country, the party and the country will certainly not neglect them. The reason is that what our party needs is this kind of party member, what the youth league needs is this kind of youth, and what the country needs is this kind of citizen. Even if Zhongzheng cannot individually misuse their names, he must always be with them

spiritually connected, and their behavior and achievements must also be made all the more great because they possess the virtues of loyalty, sincerity, and a willingness to be obscure. Zhongzheng believes that the only urgent task for young people today is to recognize the basic work they should fulfill, to seek practicality in everything, to seek diligence in everything, to exert their enthusiasm, to practice tirelessly, to work hard, to carry through to the end, and to add constant review and reflection, in order to be renewed day by day and to be more and more refined. And our youth league members should always examine themselves whether they have faithfully followed the league charter, league discipline, and league member code, and whether they can fulfill the vows without violating their oaths in terms of fulfilling group meetings, obeying all resolutions, implementing superior orders, and paying league dues. The six items listed by Zhongzheng in the statement to youth in the previous year

Have all the special tasks been faithfully fulfilled and have actual results been achieved? In particular, have they actively participated in wartime mobilization and promoted labor service, and have they been able to be law-abiding, loyal to their duties, willing to endure hardship, and unremitting from beginning to end? Can they regard struggle as their vocation and sacrifice as their duty? All of these should be reflected upon with sincerity and seriousness and make continuous efforts, so as to be worthy of being youth league members and believers of the Three Principles of the People. Finally, one more word for the youth of the whole country: The path of the Chinese revolution today has no other way to follow except the National Revolution led by our party. Zhongzheng had already announced to the youth of the whole country two years ago today that "China today can only cultivate youth by showing them a country and a doctrine. Today, China's resistance war has entered the final stage of victory. At this time when success is getting closer, it depends on the united efforts of our entire country, and our revolutionary vanguard, the youth of the whole country, should especially seize the times, strengthen their faith, understand life, and rise up in unison. Under the leadership of our party and the youth league, with a spirit of love and absolute unity, sacrifice their personal freedom and equality, and strive for the revolution and the establishment of the country and the implementation of doctrine. Zhongzheng will always lead our youth to accomplish the historical mission we bear, and to live up to the country's expectations of us. (8th dispatch)

### The United States Will Never Recognize Territory Seized by Force
### The Monroe Doctrine Has Been Fully Explained
### Hull Declares No Change in Foreign Policy

Washington - Senior government officials here recently stated that they believe President Roosevelt's Monroe Doctrine statement, issued by his secretary, O'Leary, at Hyde Park last week, outlining the principle that the Americas are for Americans, Europe for Europeans, and Asia for Asians, has caused misunderstandings among foreign people, and stated that some countries apparently cannot distinguish between the United States' Monroe Doctrine and the "Monroe Doctrines" recently announced by other countries. It must be understood that the true Monroe Doctrine does not involve occupying the land of other countries by force. The true Euro-Asian Monroe Doctrine recognized by the United States does not involve the dominance of any country in the region or the right to seize the territory of other countries by force. US officials also emphasized that President Roosevelt's words explained that territorial issues in the Americas, Europe, and Asia should be discussed and resolved jointly by the countries within each continent. Therefore, when President Roosevelt discussed the issue of Indochina, he said that the fate of that French colony should be allowed to be resolved jointly by the countries of Asia, and by no means should any Asian power be allowed to resolve it by force based on unilateral will. Yesterday's news from Chongqing said that the Chinese government was extremely surprised by President Roosevelt's words. The military in Chongqing apparently misunderstood President Roosevelt's words as the United States recognizing Japan's superior position in Asia and recognizing that the United States approved of Japan resolving the fate of Indochina, or even invading Indochina. US Secretary of State Hull, commenting on the news from Chongqing, said that the true Monroe Doctrine is completely different from other "Monroe Doctrines." The former is that all countries within a specific region can participate in resolving changes in that region, while the latter is nothing more than an excuse for military occupation. President's Secretary O'Leary also told the press that foreign people apparently misunderstood President Roosevelt's words, all because they could not recognize the difference between the true Monroe Doctrine and other "Monroe Doctrines." (9th United Press dispatch)

Washington - Secretary of State Hull declared here yesterday that President Roosevelt's Secretary O'Leary's remarks at Hyde Park on Saturday elaborating on the Monroe Doctrine do not change US foreign policy. According to O'Leary, authorized by the President, he denied that the United States intended to interfere in territorial issues in Europe and Asia, and suggested that each region should have its own Monroe Doctrine to resolve issues within each region separately. Some diplomats here believe that O'Leary's words were issued in light of the domestic situation, indicating that the United States is currently concerned about issues in the Western Hemisphere and is unwilling to interfere in affairs elsewhere. Others believe that the US government hinted that China and Japan should negotiate peace, or that the Soviet Union should divide Vietnam and drive French and German forces out of the Far East.

The United States is Authorized to Adopt a Strong Attitude to Deal With the Far East Situation

Washington - Diplomatic circles here recently believe that Roosevelt must be planning a new naval tactic to deal with the Pacific and maintain the United States' strong attitude towards Asia. This belief in diplomatic circles stems from the sudden visit of Admiral Richardson, Commander of the US Fleet, to President Roosevelt yesterday, and it is particularly noteworthy that Admiral Richardson visited the President after (1) the United States approved the law prohibiting the export of military supplies, (2) US Secretary of State Hull stated that the United States continued not to recognize Japan's hegemony in Asia, and (3) the US Navy in Shanghai arrested sixteen Japanese military police officers. (9th United Press dispatch)

Washington - US Secretary of State Hull recently told the press that he recognized the negotiations on the disposition of the Pacific fleet by the United States and Britain reported in London. (9th United Press)

The US Fleet Remains Stationed in the Pacific
Hawaii is the Main Base

Washington - Admiral Richardson, Commander of the US Fleet, declared last night after meeting with President Roosevelt that the US Fleet will remain stationed in the Pacific and that Hawaii will be its main base. Admiral Richardson said, "There are currently no plans to move the fleet away from Hawaii." Admiral Lei's arrival in Washington this time caused quite a surprise to the great scholars here, because there was no prior announcement of his intention to come to the capital. The Navy Department said, "He was summoned to the capital for several meetings." After the meeting ends, he will return to Honolulu. The Navy Department also stated that Commander Lei was summoned to the capital for a routine meeting and there was no special significance. Unofficial people believe that Admiral Richardson reported to President Roosevelt and Navy Department leaders on the recent fleet exercise on the island of Hawaii. This report may include the results of the fleet secretly leaving Hawaii two weeks ago. At that time, people generally believed that the fleet was heading to the Panama Canal. Although senior naval circles in Washington once stated that the fleet was heading to Panama, Admiral Richardson announced after returning to Hawaii that the fleet was only conducting a rapid and secret navigation exercise. A subsequent report stated that the fleet was conducting a patrol exercise to the west, including around Johnston Island. (9th United Press dispatch)

### The Big Navy Bill Passed the Senate Naval Committee

Washington - The US Senate Naval Committee recently formally passed the US$4 billion naval expansion program. The bill has already been passed by the House of Representatives. According to the bill, the United States Navy will be larger than the combined naval power of all the world's great powers. (9th United Press dispatch)

### Japan and Germany Discuss Cooperation in the Far East
### Sato and Kurusu Visit the German Foreign Minister
### Japanese Diplomacy at a Crossroads

Berlin - German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop met with former Japanese Foreign Minister Sato and Japanese Ambassador to Germany Kurusu yesterday to hold talks. According to Sato, he is currently traveling in Germany. (9th Hai Tong dispatch)

Tokyo - The "Nichi Nichi Shimbun" in Berlin reported that the meeting between Japanese Economic Mission Chief and former Foreign Minister Sato Naotake and Japanese Ambassador to Germany Kurusu Saburo with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop yesterday afternoon has attracted general attention. It is reported that the important issues discussed were the impact of the new European situation on the Far East and future cooperation between Japan and Germany. (9th Reuters dispatch)

Tokyo - Moderate Japanese people are now advocating that the government should be cautious in dealing with Germany and Italy and avoid being drawn into the vortex of the European war. This attitude has been expressed in two articles published in the "Chugai Commercial" newspaper (an organ of business and banking circles). One was written by former Japanese diplomat Tadashi, which stated, "Japan should maintain a policy of not being involved in the vortex of the current European war at any cost. Because our country cannot share in the spoils of the European war, Germany's victory over France does not mean that Japan can enjoy any benefits. Although Italy has now joined the war, Japan has no reason to participate in the war because of this. Japan has its own mission, which must be completed independently of the great powers. In the course of carrying out its mission, it may not only conflict with the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, but also with Germany or Italy. Therefore, a policy of being an enemy or friend with a certain country is not advisable. There is reason to believe that the United States has already decided to coexist with the United Kingdom. German leader Hitler also knows that since the United Kingdom has the United States as its backing, it is difficult to make it kneel. After the signing of the armistice agreement between Germany and France, it is noteworthy that he prevented the German people from making grand celebrations. Some say that the British Empire has declined, but this remains to be proven. On the contrary, looking at various signs, it is credible that the British Empire will continue to exist." In addition, the "Chugai Commercial" newspaper also published an editorial with very clear wording, which stated, "The Anti-Comintern Pact" may be strengthened, but at a time when the power of Germany and Italy is increasingly expanding, Japan should devote itself to this, which is worth considering. Foreign policy should be flexible so that it can adapt to the times. In other words, changing policies to adapt to the environment is a matter of course, but at a time when the power of Germany and Italy is expanding, relying on Germany and Italy on a larger scale is not advisable. Japan should abandon the idea of relying on other countries. Therefore, our country should not value Germany and Italy more than the United Kingdom and the United States. To this question, we should answer "No." (8th Havas dispatch)

### Special Precautions for the Panama Canal
### Expanding the Area of Sea Mines

Cristobal - It is heard that the area of "live" sea mines laid by the United States at both ends of the Panama Canal has been expanded. Currently, the authorities in the Canal Zone are taking special precautions to ensure the safety of merchant ships passing through the Canal. (9th Reuters dispatch)

Washington - Today, the US Senate unanimously approved the appointment of Colonel Edgar Earlton as Governor of the Panama Canal Zone. (9th Hai Tong dispatch)

### Soviet Navy Exercises Outside Bulgarian Ports
### The Romanian-Hungarian Dispute Remains Unresolved
### Rumors that the Soviet Union Will Make Territorial Demands on Bulgaria

Bucharest - Last night, when three members of the Romanian Iron Guard resigned, there were new developments in the political situation. It is now believed that Hungary's demand for Outer Transylvania has become a dispute again and is the center of tension in the overall situation. Another factor that makes people uneasy is that, according to reliable sources, the Soviet Black Sea Fleet is currently exercising outside the Bulgarian port of Varna. It is believed that the Soviet Union may be preparing to demand that the Bulgarian government cede Dobruja. (9th Reuters dispatch)

### The Soviet Union Extends its Influence to the Black Sea and Prepares to Open Negotiations with Turkey

Istanbul - Authoritative sources recently predicted that the Soviet Union will make new demands on Turkey within the next few days. This demand will be stronger than the request to conclude a mutual assistance treaty last year. This request may include changes to the control of the Dardanelles Strait and reductions in Turkey's guarantees to the Allied forces, all of which are beneficial to the Soviet Union. It is also believed that the Soviet Union and Turkey will likely reopen negotiations. Turkey has repeatedly solemnly stated its desire to work with the Soviet Union for peace, but authoritative sources believe that since last year's negotiations failed, the future of the current negotiations is likely to be very dark. (9th United Press dispatch)

Budapest - Rumors that the Soviet Union would take action against Turkey or Iran raised a question among people here yesterday, whether the Soviet Union was changing its pace in resolving the Turkish issue and returning to focusing on the issue of Romania. People in the Near East were unable to confirm reports that the Soviet Union had concentrated a large army on the Iranian border, as Soviet troops had recently withdrawn from the Persian border and headed to Bessarabia. (9th United Press dispatch)

Istanbul - Soviet Ambassador to Turkey Terentiev met with German Ambassador Papen for more than an hour yesterday morning before departing from Istanbul for Moscow. Political figures attached great importance to this. Papen has shortened his summer vacation in the Bosphorus and returned to the Turkish capital last night. Some observers are quite concerned about the sudden visit of the Soviet ambassador to Moscow, fearing that the German White Paper, which stated that Turkey had acquiesced to the Allies' future attacks on the Soviet Transcaucasian oil fields, would damage Turkish-Soviet friendship. People here insisted that Turkey was cautious and would never participate in anti-Soviet actions. (9th Reuters dispatch)

### Leaders of the Romanian Iron Guard Resign from the Cabinet

Bucharest - After Romanian Minister of Education and leader of the Iron Guard, Sema, and other Iron Guard members of the Gigurtu cabinet submitted their resignations, they were approved by King Carol, and Budisteanu was appointed as Minister of Education last night. According to Budisteanu, he was also a former member of the Iron Guard and was sentenced to seven years in prison in the summer of 1938 for engaging in Iron Guard activities. (9th Hai Tong dispatch)

### French Assembly Passes Resolution: Authorizing Government to Amend Constitution ‚Äì First Step Towards Dictatorial Politics ‚Äì P√©tain Elected as First Head of State

London ‚Äì According to German official news agency reports, today the joint session of the French Senate and Chamber of Deputies passed a resolution to amend the constitution with an overwhelming majority of 393 votes to 3, marking the first step of France towards a dictatorial system. This proposal was submitted by Minister without Portfolio Laval after being approved by the P√©tain government at a meeting chaired by President Lebrun. General P√©tain has been elected as the first head of the almighty France. According to the Vichy ‚Äúpalace telegram‚Äù issued by the German news agency, the original text of the resolution is as follows: The joint session hereby authorizes the Republican government, with the signature and approval of General P√©tain, to draft the constitution of the French state, which will protect the rights of workers, families, and the fatherland, and must be approved by the joint session that created this constitution. (Reuters, 9th)

London ‚Äì According to French radio news, the P√©tain government has approved a plan to amend the French constitution. The meeting was chaired by President Lebrun. (Reuters, 9th)

New Constitutional Procedures Drafted

Vichy ‚Äì According to predictions from the French Parliament, the National Assembly to be held tomorrow will take about one hour and twenty minutes. At this time, the old Senate and Chamber of Deputies will be declared dissolved, and the newly organized Senate and Chamber of Deputies will be declared established. Sources say that Deputy Prime Minister Laval will address the National Assembly on behalf of the French government. The resolutions announced at the meeting must be accepted unconditionally by the members of both houses. The resolution will grant Marshal P√©tain and his colleagues the privilege to formulate a new constitution. It is said that the original text of the resolution is very short, and the acceptance of the resolution will be indicated by all members standing up from their seats. After the opening of the National Assembly, Laval will announce a list of a committee, whose members will come from all parties and will formulate a new constitution in the capacity of consultants. The new senators will not be produced by elections, but will be selected by the government from the domestic economic and intellectual classes. It is expected that the list will not include former senators. The new Chamber of Deputies is actually similar to the Italian corporatist parliament, and its main members will mostly be representatives of workers, veterans, farmers, and businessmen. Thus, one house will be composed of employers, and the other house will probably be composed of employees. The two houses will work towards common goals. This method will actually abolish all parties in the two houses, dissolve the old French trade unions, and make the two houses merely advisory bodies to the government. Their veto power will be ignored by the cabinet. The right-wing moderates in the parliament hope to abolish bureaucracy, disorder, political favoritism, and dismiss people who are deemed unable to adapt to the new situation. Under such circumstances, the two houses will stop handling the usual procedures of the parliament. In fact, neither house needs a quorum to vote, and neither house can vote unless it has more than half the number of votes. If the government and the two houses agree, the Senate and Chamber of Deputies may not insist on this procedure. The fifteen committees organized by the Chamber of Deputies will meet until July 16. This is an old custom. Each committee will review all the issues raised by the government, but the work of each committee is actually the same. Representatives of various parties working in each committee prove that their work is unnecessary. French parliamentarians can speak in committees because they must be silent in the National Assembly. (Haitong Telegraph, 9th)

French Chamber of Deputies Leaders Scattered

Vichy ‚Äì Although the French Chamber of Deputies is scheduled to meet here today, some party leaders are not here. Former Prime Minister Blum, the leader of the Socialist Party, is one of the absentees. It is widely believed that he may not dare to attend the National Assembly. Daladier, the former prime minister who declared war on Germany and leader of the Radical Socialist Party, has also disappeared, along with many of his party members, such as former Naval Minister Campinchi, Colonial Minister Mandel, Foreign Minister Tersbos, and Vice Chairman of the Chamber of Deputies Foreign Affairs Committee, Grumbach, have all fled to North Africa. It is uncertain whether they will return to participate. Others, such as former Foreign Minister Bonnet and Aviation Minister Laurent-Eynac, although they were cabinet members at the time of the declaration of war, have since opposed the Reynaud government, causing the Socialist Party to change its attitude and support General P√©tain's policies. As for former Prime Minister Flandin, although he is currently in the occupied area, he may not attend the Chamber of Deputies meeting. (Haitong Telegraph, 9th)

French Parliamentarians in Desperate Condition

Vichy ‚Äì Since the French military collapse, the major issues currently facing the French government and people are the convening of the Senate and Chamber of Deputies and the convocation of the National Assembly to decide on the dissolution and abolition of the old parliamentary system. Currently, one can encounter sorrowful parliamentarians everywhere in France, as they know that the main task of the representatives of the French people today is to liquidate their parliamentary activities. French journalists are now gathered here, but they no longer stand inside the parliament's rest area, publishing French foreign policy, government, and personal theories to reporters. They also no longer express arguments against Hitler and the destruction of National Socialism. In short, the glory and brilliance of the former French parliamentarians have now turned into a desperate situation, with unkempt appearances wandering the streets. The elderly white-haired General P√©tain no longer travels by car, but walks in the streets, his life situation is the same as when he was the ambassador to Spain in Madrid. When he walks out of the Parc Hotel, he often looks worried and tearful, making people sympathize with the difficult task he is carrying today. When Laval walks into the Parc Hotel, his expression is also as cold as ice, only nodding slightly to the parliamentarians, without shaking hands. His sincere attitude is no longer seen today. There are about four hundred and fifty senators currently in Vichy, and General P√©tain will make a speech to them, advising them to remain silent. According to a newspaper report, the new constitution drafted by Laval is seventy-two pages long. (Haitong Telegraph, 9th)

British Embassy in London Closed

London ‚Äì The French Charg√© d'Affaires yesterday visited the British Foreign Office and confirmed that the French Embassy in London is about to be closed. The British government will respond to this notification. The exact status of relations between the British and French governments cannot be clarified until the French government considers its reply. It is widely believed that for practical reasons, the French Embassy will not be closed immediately. The British responsible party expressed regret over the French government's decision that this measure was necessary. (Reuters, 9th)

London ‚Äì The French Embassy in London closed today. Authoritative sources say that France will imitate the German and Italian plans and organize a new government. This is the last step in France's surrender to the Axis powers. It is believed that President Lebrun will resign and be replaced by Marshal P√©tain. The head of the new government will be a triumvirate of Laval, Weygand, and former Minister of Labor, Macron. (International Telegraph, 9th)

London ‚Äì The French Charg√© d'Affaires, Castelran, recently visited the British Foreign Office and confirmed that the French government has decided to sever foreign relations with Britain and close the French Embassy. (Havas, 8th)

London ‚Äì It was announced last night that French nationals in Britain will be treated as non-enemy aliens, but French nationals who are willing to actively support the goals of the Allied powers and satisfy the authorities will be given special consideration by the authorities. Now, French nationals in Britain are subject to curfew restrictions and have not been granted permits for free service and motor vehicles. The police can certify that they must comply with the order that aliens without police permits are prohibited from entering or residing in protected areas. (Reuters, 9th)

### Hitler's Final Plan for France: To Return it into an Agricultural Country

London ‚Äì The Times reported that although very little information has been allowed to leak out about Hitler's final plan for France, one member of the P√©tain cabinet has inadvertently revealed it. Labor Minister Pomaret explained that the new France will abandon its overly exaggerated industrialism and return to being an agricultural country. This policy is what Germany has planned to implement in the Balkans for several years and is currently attempting to implement in Denmark and the Netherlands. According to the German interpretation of history, Britain's power is based on its position as the center of world industrial production in the nineteenth century, because it can use overseas non-industrial colonies and territories as markets, warehouses, and sources of all raw materials. Germany's dream is to counter Britain's achievements. Germany intends to become the great industrial and military authority in the center of the continent, with the rest of Europe as its colonies, supplying it with food and serving as a market for its manufactured goods. However, within this region, Germany will never allow its industries to compete with it. France will occupy an important part in this plan. France's great industry will either be suddenly destroyed or gradually decline. It is not surprising that some right-wing politicians in France support this policy, because the complex situation of various parties in the P√©tain government cannot conceal its main nature, which is a combination of extreme right-wing elements and a small number of Fascists. The gap between the urban proletariat and the rural peasants in France has never been completely filled. A part of the right-wing figures who were formerly orthodox and are still ardent Catholics, such as P√©tain and Weygand, often want to rely on the Catholic peasants to save France, so as to defeat the forces of practical industrial workers and freedom of thought. These loyal and enthusiastic elements do not hesitate to carry out a movement against French industrialism and the proletariat, and are willing to fall into Hitler's trap. This is ignorant of the times, because the agricultural France in the twentieth century is nothing more than a slave to industrial Germany. Today's newspaper comments involve several issues, including Germany's holding of France, Britain's air force strength, and the current implementation of tea rationing. (Reuters, 9th)

### Over a Hundred German Aircraft Launch Large-Scale Attack on Britain - British Ship "Whirlwind" Sunk by Torpedo - British Spitfire Aircraft Scatter German Aircraft Formation

Stockholm ‚Äì Britain encountered a large-scale air raid by German bombers on Sunday night, which can be described as the most fierce since the beginning of the war. According to a London dispatch received by the "Alehanda" newspaper here, a large number of bombers, escorted by high-speed Messerschmitt fighter planes, flew to Britain and dropped bombs on various commercial ports in the English Channel and other important military targets. The exact number of German aircraft participating in this air raid is still unknown, but it is at least over a hundred, because the area under attack at the same time is very wide. The British Broadcasting Corporation admitted yesterday that the scope of German air raids in the past twenty-four hours has been unusually large. (Haitong Telegraph, 9th) London ‚Äì Last night, officials announced that the British destroyer "Whirlwind" was sunk by a torpedo. Survivors were rescued by another British ship before the ship sank. The "Whirlwind" had a displacement of 1,100 tons and was equipped with four 4-inch guns. (Haitong Press, 9th)

London ‚Äì Yesterday afternoon, people on the southern coast of Britain witnessed German bombers attacking a convoy in the English Channel. The German aircraft dropped many bombs, but they all landed in the sea without any aim, causing waterspouts to rise. The ships' anti-aircraft guns fired fiercely, forcing the German aircraft to retreat. At least one German aircraft was seen falling into the sea, and the pilot parachuted out. Two other aircraft were shot down and caught fire. British Spitfire fighters quickly flew to attack the German fighters protecting the bombers and scattered the enemy aircraft formation. Machine gun bullets fell in a nearby town, and residents ran for shelter. (Reuters, 9th)

British Ship Sunk off the Coast of Ireland

London ‚Äì According to an announcement last night, the British ship "Arandora Star" was sunk by a torpedo off the west coast of Ireland on July 2, drowning 143 Germans and 470 Italians. The "Arandora Star" was carrying about 1,500 detained Germans and Italians to Canada when it was sunk by a torpedo. (Reuters, 9th)

British Bomber Squadron Night Raid on Key German Locations

London ‚Äì A statement from the Air Ministry said that on Sunday, British Air Force bombers launched a night raid on military targets in the German territories of Ruweihaven and Langkof, and railway side lines and loading yards in places such as Grangberg were bombed. The Wilhelmshaven naval barracks and the canal between Duisburg and Lunrot were also hit. Airfields in places such as Hait and flying ports in Rotterdam and Beijing were also attacked. Two British aircraft were missing. British Coastal Command aircraft attacked the port of Bologne on Sunday night, hitting an enemy supply ship. Early yesterday morning, British aircraft attacked the port of Ostend, hitting a large enemy supply ship and damaging the canal sluice. Several naval storage depots caught fire. All British aircraft returned safely. (Reuters, 9th)

British Aircraft Shoot Down Six Enemy Aircraft in One Day

London ‚Äì The Air Ministry issued a statement last night stating that British fighters shot down two enemy fighters near the southeastern coast yesterday afternoon. In the evening, a British fighter on patrol off the west coast shot down an enemy bomber. It is now known that a total of six enemy aircraft were shot down yesterday. (Reuters, 9th)

London ‚Äì A joint statement from the Air Ministry and the Ministry of Internal Security said that enemy aircraft flew over eastern and southern Britain and northeastern Scotland last night. Enemy aircraft dropped bombs in areas near the coast, causing slight damage to houses and very few casualties. This morning, another enemy aircraft flew over the southeastern coast, flying very high and dropping about twenty incendiary bombs. Several fires broke out in the suburbs and were quickly extinguished. There were no casualties among the residents. In one city on the southeastern coast, one person was killed and one injured in an air raid. In one city in Scotland, only two people were slightly injured in the bombing. One area in Wales was bombed by enemy aircraft, causing no damage. (Reuters, 9th)

London ‚Äì The Air Ministry confirmed that British aircraft shot down four more enemy aircraft yesterday, bringing the total to eight for the day. The British lost three fighter planes. (Reuters, 9th)

Germany Will Not Issue Air Raid Alerts for Single Enemy Aircraft

Berlin ‚Äì German Air Force Commander-in-Chief General G√∂ring announced yesterday that in the future, whether day or night, if it is clearly proven that only one enemy aircraft is attacking, no air raid alert will be issued to avoid unnecessary disturbances to the public and economic life. However, when a single enemy aircraft attacks and there is anti-aircraft fire, the public must immediately take shelter and not stay on the streets to avoid injury. (Haitong Telegraph, 9th)

Some German Aircraft Fly Without Sound

London ‚Äì German bombers and fighters circled over the English Channel all day, carrying out heavy bombing. Several aircraft glided down from high altitude without sound. This is different from the usual dive bombing, because when they fly towards the ground, they often emit a sharp echo, which frightens the eyewitnesses. (International Telegraph, 9th)

### German War Report

Berlin ‚Äì This afternoon's German war report stated that one German submarine sank 56,500 tons of British merchant ships, and another sank the British destroyer "Whirlwind" and armed cargo ships, including an oil tanker with a displacement of 11,660 tons. German speedboats launched an attack on the southern coast of Britain, and one British patrol boat was sunk. German fighters bombed British ports, armories, and ships, such as the dockyards in Devonport, Thames Port, the chemical industrial plants in Billingham, and the match factory in the Halvi area, which were all hit by bombs. A cruiser in the English Channel was damaged, and a destroyer in the North Sea was injured. Five merchant ships were damaged, and several aircraft were destroyed in the airfields.

### Britain Becomes a Large Military Camp ‚Äì Unprecedented Numbers of Troops Ready for Battle ‚Äì Nine Divisions of the Expeditionary Force Reorganized

London ‚Äì Military personnel here recently stated that the British Isles have now become a large military camp. In addition to the nine divisions of the Expeditionary Force previously sent to the mainland, there are also various local volunteer defense forces of the Home Forces, Expeditionary Forces from various autonomous territories, and troops from various Entente countries. The number of personnel is unprecedented, ready for battle, and prepared to resist the German invasion. (1) The Expeditionary Force, which retreated back to the country from Dunkirk in France, has been reorganized, and its military equipment is complete. It can fight anytime, anywhere. (2) The Home Forces have sufficient strength. In the past month and the first few days of this month, there have been as many as 7,000 recruits joining the army every day. (3) There are a total of one million strong volunteer defense forces throughout the country. Most of the tasks previously undertaken by the regular army have been replaced by the defense forces, so the dispatch of the regular army is more convenient. (4) Various autonomous territories such as the Commonwealth of Australia, the Commonwealth of Canada, and New Zealand have sent Expeditionary Forces to Britain. (5) Various Entente countries such as France, Czech Republic, Poland, the Netherlands, and Norway have troops stationed in Britain. In addition, the British government has also stepped up its efforts to strengthen national defense in transportation and industry, and has taken special measures to prevent Germany from blockading the British Isles, so as to ensure that various sources of supply are not interrupted. (Havas, 8th)

London ‚Äì Responsible parties in London stated that the nine divisions of the British army carried back from Dunkirk have now been reorganized to the point of full strength. The commissioned and non-commissioned officers are complete, and the equipment is complete. This division is under the control of the Commander-in-Chief and is preparing for war in the country. In addition, the various divisions of the Home Forces are also subject to the dispatch of the Commander-in-Chief. The total number of men called into service in June and July to strengthen the national defense has increased several times compared to May. It is said that the total number of guard troops has also increased. It is estimated that 7,000 men are joining the army every day, and this has been the case for several weeks. The number of local defense volunteers has exceeded one million. These people can be expected to prove their great value and replace some of the tasks of the battlefield army, which can increase the mobility of the battlefield army. (Reuters, 9th)

### British Navy Continues Military Actions Against Remaining French Fleet ‚Äì French Battleship "Richelieu" Attacked ‚Äì US Fleet Monitors Situation in French West Indies

London ‚Äì Navy Secretary Alexander declared in the House of Commons today when answering questions that the French new battleship "Richelieu" (35,000 tons), which is berthed in the port of Dakar in French West Africa, is the world's newest and most formidable battleship. Because the French naval commander of the port refused to comply with the British request, the British ship "Bristol" sailed into the port on July 8 and bravely approached the "Richelieu" and fired depth charges, damaging the ship. (Reuters, 9th)

London ‚Äì According to this news, the British Air Force continued its activities yesterday to prevent important warships of the French fleet from falling into enemy hands. British aircraft took action to deal with the French recently completed 35,000-ton battleship "Richelieu", and it was very effective. (Reuters, 5th)

Washington ‚Äì According to responsible parties here, six US destroyers and one heavy cruiser are currently docked near the French island of Martinique, "observing" the situation on the island. At the same time, the British Embassy has notified the US government that it has not blockaded the island. Currently, the French aircraft carrier "B√©arn" and the cruiser "Jeanne d'Arc" are anchored in the island's harbor. (Haitong Telegraph, 9th)

Berlin ‚Äì According to the German semi-official agency, the German news agency, a British aircraft carrier sent out several aircraft and launched an air raid on Volong. Its purpose was obviously to bomb the French ship that had been damaged in the Algerian campaign, so as to destroy it to the point where it could not be repaired. (International Telegraph, 9th)

Berlin ‚Äì According to the German official news agency's dispatch from Rome, Italian newspapers reported that several French ships have left Casablanca in French Morocco for Langa Port. (Reuters, 9th)

Geneva ‚Äì Diplomatic circles here received news today that a large-scale naval battle between the British and French navies has broken out off the coast of Martinique in the French West Indies. According to unconfirmed reports, a British destroyer team attacked the French ships there, similar to the Volong naval battle. It is heard that the British policy is that the 500 American-made aircraft and millions of American dollars owned by the French in Martinique must be seized in their entirety. This war has aroused many speculations, that is, what action will the United States take if the war affects American territorial waters? Well-informed circles in Switzerland all believe that Martinique is very close to the Panama Canal, so the United States may take severe actions. (International Telegraph, 9th)

Vichy ‚Äì The French government announced yesterday that the French aircraft carrier "Teste" is now safely anchored in a French port. The rumor that the ship has sunk is not true. (Haitong Telegraph, 9th)

French Fleet in Alexandria Disarmed

Alexandria ‚Äì The British naval authorities here today issued a statement detailing the quiet situation of the disarmament of the French fleet in this port, stating that Admiral Godfroy, the commander-in-chief of the French fleet, considering that sending the ships he commanded into the sea would inevitably endanger the lives of the officers and men on board, decided to disarm all of his ships. The general carefully considered the various proposals made by the British side (the same as those made to the commander of the French fleet in Volong Port), made his ships unable to sail in the sea, disarmed them, and reduced the number of officers and men. The agreed-upon measures at the time were as follows: (1) To ensure that the ships could not be sailed into the sea, this was accomplished by reducing the amount of oil in the ships to only be sufficient for sailing within the port. (2) To disarm the ships, this was accomplished by transporting some parts of the weapons ashore and handing them over to the French authorities on shore for safekeeping. (3) To reduce the number of officers and men on board the ships, only those sufficient for taking care of and maintaining the ships were left. This matter is currently being handled. The officers and men leaving the ships will first be sent to Syria, and then sent back to their country later. (Reuters, 9th)

### Gibraltar Continues to be Air Raided ‚Äì British Fleet Sails East in its Entirety

### General Tegart Speaks on the Oran Incident

London - General Tegart, the initiator of the French National Committee, delivered a radio address tonight, commenting on the clash between the British and French fleets at the French port of Oran in North Africa on the 3rd of this month. He stated, "This is indeed an exceptionally tragic event, and all French people are saddened and angered by it. However, we should be honest with each other about this matter. Therefore, I dare to say to the British people that the French fleet was in no position to fight at the time, and it should not be regarded as a great victory for the British Navy. At the same time, I also ask the French people to think of victory and liberation, because it is better to lose a few French warships than to have them fall into enemy hands and be used to attack French colonies and Britain."

### British Forces in Egypt Control Vast Desert Areas, Italian Defense Forces in Libya Dare Not Move, Twelve Italian Trucks Destroyed

London - A Reuters correspondent with the British forces sends news from the western Egyptian desert, stating that British forces have now controlled a vast area of about three thousand five hundred square miles in the Libyan desert. Although the Italian radio station tries to deny it, it cannot hide the truth. The reporter spent fourteen hours in the camp of a British advance patrol forty miles deep into Italian territory. The location is only a few miles away from the headquarters of the Italian army in the Libyan theater. Harassed by British forces, the Italian army is now unwilling to appear openly. In the past forty-eight hours, armored vehicle units from both sides clashed, causing heavy casualties to the Italian side. As a result, about one thousand Italian soldiers defending the Capuzzo battery were discouraged. Last night, twelve Italian trucks were destroyed, bringing the total to fifty Italian trucks destroyed in the past five days, along with two enemy warplanes. When enemy fighters swooped down on British fighters, they were shot down by the British planes within two minutes, caught fire, and crashed to the ground. The battle is ongoing, and in the still air eighty miles away, there is the sound of artillery fire and aerial bombing. The reporter was carefully escorted in an armored vehicle, sneaking through a gap in the Italian barbed wire "wall" and finally reaching within ten miles behind the Capuzzo battery. Standing on top of the armored vehicle, the reporter watched British shells fall on the Capuzzo battery. The journey only encountered the enemy once, when an enemy warplane circled down and strafed the armored vehicle, but the fire was inaccurate and all the bullets missed. (Reuters, 9th)

### British Cabinet Likely to Undergo Partial Reorganization, Lloyd George to Join Cabinet, Chamberlain May Resign

London - Well-informed members of Parliament recently stated that Lloyd George, the Prime Minister during the previous European War, may join the current war cabinet. They also stated that Prime Minister Churchill will soon invite this senior Liberal Party member to join the cabinet. They also believe that when Lloyd George joins the cabinet, the current Lord President of the Council and former Prime Minister Chamberlain may resign. Although Prime Minister Churchill has loyally defended Chamberlain, it is widely believed that Chamberlain cannot be indifferent to the growing public demand for his resignation. According to members of Parliament, all parties and the Conservative Party will force Lloyd George to accept Churchill's invitation. It is said that Chamberlain has offered to resign many times, but Churchill has refused. Even when public opinion attacked Chamberlain, Churchill defended him in many ways. The last blow Chamberlain received was the public opinion poll published in the "News Chronicle," in which 77% of voters demanded Chamberlain's resignation, 63% demanded Simon's resignation, 55% demanded Chancellor of the Exchequer Wood's resignation, and 57% demanded Foreign Secretary Halifax's resignation. These people were all members of Chamberlain's cabinet and supporters of his appeasement policy. (United Press, 9th)

Rome - This morning, the Italian newspaper "Messaggero" reported that London opposes Churchill's succession as Prime Minister, and that the Conservative Party, which has been in power for nine years, should step down and make way for more capable people. There are many supporters of Labor Party leader Bevan to become Prime Minister. (Haitong, 9th)

### Southern Ireland Firmly Declares Neutrality, North-South Ireland Joint Defense Negotiations Fail

London - Last night, the capital of Southern Ireland published Prime Minister de Valera's July 5th conversation with a New York Times reporter. De Valera firmly declared that Southern Ireland is determined to maintain neutrality. If Southern Ireland is invaded, whether Germany wants to use it as a starting point to attack Britain, or Britain wants to occupy Southern Ireland first to prevent a German attack, Southern Ireland will resist. De Valera also said that there is a need for the unification of Ireland, saying that the South maintains neutrality, while Northern Ireland is a belligerent country. From the standpoint of national defense, this is abnormal. In this emergency period, Ireland should be whole and not divided. Only in this way can a national defense plan based on neutrality be decided. The Southern Irish government wants the Northern Irish Parliament to obey the all-Irish Parliament rather than the British Parliament. If one country is allowed to intervene, it is tantamount to inviting another country to attack. Therefore, the only hope is to not allow any country to intervene. (Reuters, 9th)

Stockholm - According to a correspondent for the "Aftonbladet" in London, the British government invited de Valera to London to discuss British assistance to Ireland in strengthening its defenses. However, as of yesterday, Ireland has shown no willingness to cooperate with Britain. Ireland still refuses to allow British troops to be stationed in Irish territory. It is said that the Irish government believes that it does not need the assistance of any country, because Ireland has a force of 500,000, which is enough to undertake the defense of its homeland. (Haitong, 9th)

Stockholm - This morning, newspapers reported from London that negotiations for a joint defense between Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland have completely failed. (Haitong, 9th)

### German Foreign Ministry Publishes Sixth White Paper, French Requests for Reinforcements to Britain (Continued)

Berlin - The German Foreign Ministry yesterday continued to publish the sixth volume of the White Paper on the secret political files of the French General Staff, revealing that the French government repeatedly requested the British government to increase the strength of the expeditionary force in early May when German troops attacked the Western Front.

The tenth file is a telegram from General Gamelin to British Air Marshal Newall on May 15, the content of which is roughly as follows: "Marshal Newall, I am now supplementing my government's request. Your country should send ten squadrons of fighter planes to the Champagne base. One thing that must be noted is that if Italy participates in the war, France will have to move fighter squadrons to southeastern France and Tunisia. Our country will provide the necessary personnel on land. The detailed arrangements can be directly discussed by General Fleming and General Barratt, Gamelin (signed)." The eleventh file is a telegram from General Gamelin to British General Lillington on the following day (May 16 at 10:10 am), which reads roughly as follows: "General Lillington, the situation is extremely serious. Please forward to Churchill, according to the previously agreed arrangements, immediately dispatch ten squadrons of fighter planes. Our country will station them in the Lower Seine area, which can protect their safety and facilitate their recall by your country, Gamelin (signed)."

The twelfth file is another telegram from General Gamelin to General Lillington at 2:20 pm on May 16, reiterating the previous request, which reads roughly as follows: "General Lillington, dare to ask you to forward to Churchill again, the time is urgent. It is important for the British and French air forces to prevent the enemy from attacking, and there is no time to delay, Gamelin (signed)." The thirteenth file is a telegram from General Gamelin to British Prime Minister Churchill at 9:25 am on May 17, again repeating the previous request, which reads roughly as follows: "Prime Minister Churchill, since this morning, the troops commanded by General Girard have been fighting hard south of Maubeuge. The battle is very fierce. The results will not only have a serious impact on France, but also on Britain. The current battle situation seems to be threatening the communication links of your expeditionary force. Therefore, we urgently hope that your air force will set off to help in the battle as soon as possible. At the same time, if mines can be laid in the Meuse River, it will definitely disrupt the enemy's reinforcements and transportation, Gamelin (signed)."

The fourteenth file is the minutes of the Anglo-French Supreme Military Conference held at the headquarters of the new French Commander-in-Chief, General Weygand, on May 22, 1940, discussing the serious battle situation after the German army broke through Abbeville and surrounded the Allied forces in Flanders. General Weygand expressed the opinion that the Allied forces in Flanders' attempt to break through to the south would surely fail, but if British and French troops attacked Flanders on one side, and Belgian troops took on the task of cover on the east and north sides, there would be hope of retreating to the west. Churchill and Dill believed that protecting the ports of the Channel was the most important thing because the British army only had four days of food left. After agreeing on the battle strategy for the next few days, General Weygand, in a firm but courteous manner, asked Britain to send more air force to operate in the selected locations. British Air Vice-Marshal Bales then declared that it only took twenty minutes for British fighter planes to fly from England to the war zone. At the same time, Vice-Marshal Bales also agreed to send bomber groups to attack the rear of the German army. At the end of the meeting, Churchill declared that the most important thing at the moment was to hold each position. General Weygand replied, "What is needed now is action."

The fifteenth and sixteenth files are telegrams exchanged between Reynaud and Churchill on May 24. Churchill's telegram reads roughly as follows: "Premier Reynaud, your country's General Gort regrets that the British, French, and Belgian armies lack cooperation in the north, especially the Belgian headquarters' failure to issue instructions, which prevents military operations from proceeding. We also know nothing about your country's instructions and the detailed strategy for the northern battles. We hope to immediately inform our embassy in France so that it can be forwarded to the government." Reynaud's reply reads roughly as follows: "At the recent Anglo-French Supreme Military Conference, the plan proposed by General Weygand has been fully agreed to by your country's officers. However, Weygand is now horrified to discover that the British army has retreated from Arras, contrary to the plan. General Weygand has learned that British heavy ordnance units have boarded ships from Le Havre, causing unrest in the rear and causing chaos. Your country's military actions were not notified to our country in advance.

General Weygand and I are both horrified. It is important to know that at this time of success or failure, we should seek unified command and implement General Weygand's orders." (Haitong, 5th)

### Norwegian King Refuses to Abdicate, Upholds the National Constitution, Continues to Perform His Duties

London - The Presidium of the Norwegian Parliament, instigated by the Germans, asked King Haakon to abdicate. The King refused, saying that the freedom and independence of the Norwegian people are the primary purpose of the Norwegian Constitution. He adheres to this purpose, firmly defends the position and duties given to him by the free people of Norway in 1905, and serves the Norwegian people. If there are conditions in Norway that allow him and the government to return to the country and work freely, the government can immediately return to the country. The clear condition for this move is the complete withdrawal of all soldiers at home and abroad. Norwegian Foreign Minister Guthe detailed to a Reuters reporter the reasons why the King refused to abdicate, saying that on June 14, Norwegian newspapers were forced to publish articles stating that the King and the government had abandoned Norway, so a new government should be formed to take over legislative power and recognize the German occupation as legal. After that, the Presidium of the Parliament gathered to ask the King and the government to step down. The Presidium originally had six members, but only four remained in the occupied area. The Conservative Party illegally appointed one person. The five people who are now asking the King to abdicate are all undoubtedly at the instigation of the Nazis. The Norwegian puppet government only lasted for three days before the Germans abolished it, eager to form another puppet regime to recognize its occupying rule according to German intentions. However, they will find it extremely difficult to abolish the King and the government, because the Norwegian Constitution stipulates that in wartime, the King may leave the country indefinitely without losing his constitutional powers if necessary. Now the King has only been out of the country for a month. Under this circumstance, there is absolutely no basis in the Constitution for the King to abdicate. (Reuters, 9th)

### Danish New Government's Foreign Policy to Cooperate Loyally with Germany, Building a New European Order

Copenhagen - After attending the first cabinet meeting, Danish Foreign Minister Scavenius issued a statement last night, elaborating on Denmark's foreign policy, which was unanimously approved by the cabinet. His statement roughly stated that the situation in August 1914 during the World War was the same as in April of this year, that is, the purpose of German foreign policy is to keep Denmark out of the war. The German troops currently in Denmark have not caused any trouble or disputes, which should be solemnly announced to the people of the country. The great victory of the German corps this time has made the world admire it, creating a new situation in Europe. Rebuilding Europe's politics and economy under German leadership and seeking active cooperation with Germany has now become a necessary task for Denmark. The Danish people believe that under the construction of a new European order, they will be able to maintain Denmark's independence and autonomy, and hope that Denmark's political and social development can be understood. (Haitong, 9th)

Copenhagen - Scavenius has been appointed as the Danish Foreign Minister for the third time. Scavenius's first term as Foreign Minister was from 1909 to 1910, and his second term was from 1923 to 1920. From 1924 to 1932, Scavenius was appointed as the Danish Minister to Sweden. Scavenius is now 63 years old and serves as the director of the "Politiken" newspaper. Scavenius was a member of the Danish Parliament twice, from 1918 to 1920 and from 1925 to 1927. (Haitong, 9th)

The Prime Minister also invited Stirling, the former Minister of National Defence of the Conservative government, to join the War Committee. (Reuters, 9th)

### British Food Consumption Conserves, Living Frugally, Coping with Long-Term Siege

London - Minister of Food Hulton said last night that there is sufficient food in the country, but the people of the country must prepare for a long-term siege. Now is the time for the people of the country to engage in a simple life and strive to be frugal. In terms of the current situation, the food situation is better than before. The purchased food is now being transported in steadily. Anyone who can hold out a week or a few days longer than the enemy will win. He wants the British people to be able to hold out the longest. Therefore, tea will soon be rationed by population, two ounces per person per week, and artificial cream will also be rationed at the same time as cream within half a month. Hotels and restaurants may not provide guests with both fish and meat at the same time. There are no restrictions on the sale of tea in restaurants, but tea sellers must report the amount of tea sold. He estimates that the tea allocation method will reduce the average consumption by a quarter per person. (Reuters, 9th)

### Hong Kong-Shanghai Boy Scouts Summer Camp to Begin August 8th

(Hong Kong Correspondence) The Hong Kong Chinese YMCA has held annual summer camps for boys for many years. Last year, on August 22nd, they gathered youth from all over Hong Kong at the Wa Ying College in Tung Chung, Lantau Island. Now, due to widespread warfare, the Hong Kong government has issued wartime regulations, making outdoor camping problematic. People outside are quite concerned about this. According to a responsible person from the YMCA, Boy Scout camping does not conflict with Hong Kong law and will continue to be held without being affected by the war. The YMCA sent staff to Lantau Island, Tung Chung, and obtained the consent of Wa Ying College to use the school as the office for the summer camp. The YMCA has decided to hold the camp at Tung Chung, Lantau Island for seven consecutive days from August 8th to August 14th, as before. Zhou Zhenguang, Lu Bingliang, and others have been hired as leaders. The number of members is tentatively set at 60, including 20 YMCA members (i.e., members of the Hong Kong YMCA), 20 representatives from various schools in Hong Kong, and 20 Shanghai YMCA members. Since Shanghai has become an isolated island, camping activities are difficult to hold due to environmental constraints. Therefore, this year, the camp is jointly organized with the Hong Kong YMCA. These enthusiastic young people will come to Hong Kong by boat at the end of July to enter the camp. The invited schools sending representatives to participate in Hong Kong include Pui Ying, Mei Wah, Pui Ching, St. Paul's, China News College, Wa Ying, Min Sheng, Ling Ying, and the Teacher Training Class. The deadline for registration is July 17th for the first phase and July 30th for the second phase (the final phase). Non-members need to pay a fee of five yuan, while members only pay three yuan. All other expenses will be covered by the YMCA. The detailed arrangements for the camp are still being drafted.

### Hezhong Cup Basketball Tournament: Youlian Defeats Qunyi Yesterday; Both Sides' Actions Were Excessive, and the Game Lacked Excitement; In Division A, Group 2, Muer Defeats Xihua

In the Hezhong Cup charity basketball tournament yesterday, in the game between Muer and Xihua in Division A, Group 2, Xihua led 12-10 in the first half. In the end, Muer reversed the situation and won 35-25. The game between Youlian and Qunyi in Division A, Group 1, began. At the start, the two sides were evenly matched. Then, Youlian made every shot, leading 39-25 at halftime. After the change of sides, Youlian continued to take the lead, once creating a huge score of 51-29. Qunyi struggled hard, forcing the score to a close 53-60, but time was running out, and Qunyi finally suffered a crushing defeat of 56-66. In yesterday's game, the players on both sides lacked clarity in their actions, with excessive moves occurring from time to time. The referee warned both team captains. It is hoped that all players will pay attention to sportsmanship in the future and avoid similar situations from happening again, so as not to betray the original intention of the organizers in promoting sports.

Youlian Leads

After the initial contact, Qunyi's Zi Ren tried a basket, and it went in. However, it was ruled invalid because his foot stepped on the baseline. Soon, Xiangrui made a free throw to open the scoring. Gu Ju Xiaoguang returned the favor, and Zhou, Shen, and Fan all scored three points in a row. Youlian came from behind. Shaosheng made two good shots, and Qunyi regained the lead. After that, Youlian's generals made every shot, and the score soared. Although Qunyi also gained something, it was only for decoration. At the end of the first half, Youlian led 39-25.

Qunyi Loses

After the change of sides, Youlian replaced Gu Ju with Bingheng, who scored the first point. Qunyi's defense showed many loopholes, and Youlian took advantage of the situation to attack, scoring repeatedly. The scoreboard showed 51-29, a difference of 22 points. At this time, both sides' actions were dragging and clumsy, with successive fouls. Under Qunyi's fierce counterattack, Renan, Jinxiang, and Xiaoguang suddenly increased the score by ten points, showing signs of resurgence. Qingxian was dismissed for four fouls, and Qunyi forced the score to a close 53-60. Youlian responded calmly and finally defeated Qunyi 66-56.

In the second half, Gelian launched a major counterattack, but Samsung's defense was solid. In the last three minutes, Samsung center Wu Shaotai received a header from Zhou Defu, broke through the two generals Hu Hanwen and Meng Yiliang, and kicked the ball into the net from about 20 yards. As a result, Samsung Club overwhelmed Gelian 2-0 and will compete with Shilai team, the champion of Group B, for the overall championship.

### Incident of Detaining Japanese Military Police: US Commander Details the Process; Duty-Bound to Prevent Terrorist Activities; No Notification Given of Japanese Soldiers Entering US Defense Zone

On the third anniversary of the July 7th Anti-Japanese War, the concession authorities were on high alert to maintain order. The Chinese within the concession also knew to restrain their emotions and stay in their respective positions. This great festival of historical significance that attracted worldwide attention has passed peacefully. On that day, the US Marines discovered 16 plainclothes Japanese military police carrying weapons in the defense zone. Because they violated the defense agreements of various countries, they were arrested and detained. On the afternoon of the same day, the Japanese military police commander Miura met with the US military authorities and apologized in person, and took back the 16 plainclothes military police. This minor disturbance turned into a strong protest to the US after the apology, and the Japanese newspapers fueled the flames, exaggerating the situation, causing the city to be in an uproar and the situation to escalate. However, the US remained calm and indifferent. The details are recorded below:

Reuters, Washington, 9th: US Secretary of State Hull told reporters yesterday that he believed the dispute over the treatment of Japanese military police detained by US soldiers in Shanghai on July 7th could be resolved by local officials in a reasonable and practical manner.

Colonel Baker Clarifies Position

Japanese Side Apologized to US Military

The English-language Da Mei Evening News stated that Colonel Baker, commander of the Fourth US Marine Corps in Shanghai, recently met with reporters and reaffirmed that Lieutenant General Miura, commander of the Japanese military police, had apologized to the US military authorities for the incident of Japanese military police entering the US military defense zone in plain clothes and carrying guns on Sunday. The US military headquarters had a stenographic record when Miura came to apologize.

Three People Were Found to Have Minor Skin Injuries

Regarding the Japanese claim that the 16 plainclothes Japanese military police arrested by the US military were abused, Colonel Baker stated that before the US military detained the Japanese, they were examined by a military doctor as usual. It was found that three of them had skin cuts. These three resisted arrest.

It is Too Late to Ask for Secrecy

Colonel Baker also denied the Japanese claim that US officials violated the agreement by disclosing the details of the incident to the press, saying that the US military did not receive the Japanese request not to announce the matter until late that day. However, the details of the incident had already been broadcast by radio. The Western evening newspapers sold on the street at 2:30 PM also recorded the incident.

Duty-Bound to Maintain Order

The US military authorities did not receive notification from the Japanese side regarding the armed military police entering the defense zone. That day was the third anniversary of the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. US soldiers were maintaining order in the defense zone and were responsible for arresting anyone in plain clothes carrying weapons.

US Headquarters Issues Statement

Assisted in Defense on the July 7th Anniversary

The US Marine Corps Headquarters issued the following statement today (9th) regarding the incident: On July 7, 1940, the third anniversary of the July 7th Incident, the Fourth Marine Corps actively assisted the Public Works Bureau's police department in preventing anti-Japanese demonstrations and terrorist activities at the request of the Public Works Bureau's police department.

Plainclothes Japanese People Looked Suspicious

At around 10:00 AM on that day, US soldiers received a report from a police officer that plainclothes Japanese people, believed to be military police, were secretly hiding guns and gathering on Jing'an Temple Road, the route of Japanese General Nishio. General Nishio's safety in the US military defense zone was the responsibility of the US military. These plainclothes Japanese people were either terrorists and should be expelled immediately.

No Time to Investigate, Arrest First

At that time, there was no time to communicate with the Japanese authorities to determine who these people were. A US military officer led a patrol team, accompanied by a police officer from the police department, pointed out the suspicious Japanese people and arrested them. Several of them resisted and showed their business cards, claiming to be Japanese military police. However, the US military authorities had not received notification that Japanese military police were operating in the US military defense zone, so they did not believe them.

Demanding an Apology Before Release

Then, the leader of these Japanese people was allowed to report to his superiors. A Japanese military police officer came to the US headquarters and identified them as Japanese military police. The US military authorities then told the Japanese officer that they would be released, but they hoped that Japanese military police commander Miura would apologize for sending disguised people into the US military defense zone with weapons without obtaining US permission.

Miura Officially Expressed Regret

At 3:00 PM, Miura arrived at the US military headquarters and expressed regret for the incident, saying that he had not notified the US military and that it was accidental. He guaranteed that the same incident would not happen again. The arrested Japanese people were then released. When these people were arrested, a military doctor examined them as usual and found that only three of them were injured due to resisting arrest, with only skin cuts that could be treated with iodine. In short, on this anniversary, there was a possibility of anti-Japanese demonstrations, and the sudden appearance of senior Japanese people in the US military defense zone only increased the US military's burden of ensuring their safety.

Reasons Given by the Japanese Spokesman

Japanese Side Believes it is a Serious Insult

The North China Daily News stated that the incident of the US military arresting 16 armed Japanese military police in the defense zone on Sunday is expected to cause a reaction soon. The Japanese Army spokesman admitted at a press conference yesterday (8th) that the Japanese military police entered the US military defense zone without prior notification, but claimed that the Japanese side felt that the US military's actions were "a serious insult to the Japanese military police and the entire Japanese army."

Claiming that the US Military Gave Up its Responsibilities

The spokesman also claimed that three or four Japanese military police were beaten with rifle butts by US soldiers, causing head and body injuries, and that the arrested Japanese military police were all abused. The Japanese side will immediately protest to the US military authorities. The entire issue will depend on the US military's attitude. The conclusion reached by the Japanese side is that the US military has actually given up its responsibilities, because defense forces must protect foreigners and their own nationals in their defense zone.

Reiterating that the Military Police Were Abused

The matter seemed to have been resolved, but after questioning the arrested Japanese military police, it was learned that the US soldiers had followed the notification from the Public Works Bureau from the beginning and intended to arrest the Japanese military police. After the US soldiers captured the Japanese military police, they beat them with guns and continued to insult them on the way to the headquarters. The Japanese military police were forced to "prostrate" under the rifles and were treated like prisoners. The Japanese military police had strict orders to resist under any circumstances, so they did not fight back.

Their Faces Were at Stake in Front of the Chinese

They acted on the orders of their superiors and were not to blame. But they were abused. The US soldiers also tore up the Japanese military police's business cards and other rude insults. These actions were unnecessary and unjustified. They knew that the Japanese people were military police, but they still insulted them. The Japanese military police entered the US military defense zone without prior notification, which was the fault of the Japanese side. However, the US military's arrest of the Japanese military police in front of the Chinese graduates cannot be regarded as a friendly action towards Japan.

Will Make Demands if Necessary

It is now believed that the nature of the case will become serious. The Japanese military will lodge a strong protest with the US authorities and will not attach demands. However, the Japanese side reserves the right to make demands if necessary. As for the outcome, it will depend on the US military's attitude after the prompt protest note. It is said that the Japanese side may not welcome armed plainclothes US soldiers entering Hongkou. The spokesman replied that if the US soldiers showed proper identification, the Japanese side would consider it. However, they would not be subjected to the same treatment as the Japanese military police.

### Izumo Battleship Opens Fire on Shengjing Ship; Entered Without Inspection; Believed to be Deliberately Disobeying; Said that the Ship had French Military Supplies

The Shengjing, a regular ship of the British Taikoo Shipping Company's northern route, weighs more than 3,000 tons. This time, it returned to Shanghai from Tianjin via Yantai and Qingdao. When it entered Wusong Port at 12:50 PM (customs clock) yesterday, the Japanese army stationed at Wusong Port immediately ordered the ship to stop. The ship owner did not pay attention and continued to move upstream along the Huangpu River. Seeing that the Shengjing did not stop, the Japanese army believed that it was disobeying "orders" and notified the Izumo Battleship by telephone.

Izumo Raises Flag

When the ship reached the vicinity of the Izumo Battleship at around 2:00 PM (i.e., the Huangpu River surface at the China Merchants Bureau's middle pier outside the Hongqiao Bridge), the Izumo Battleship also raised a flag ordering the Shengjing to stop. However, the ship still did not pay attention and continued to move forward. The Japanese army on the ship was furious and believed that the ship had not paid attention when entering the port and had not stopped, and that it was deliberately disobeying.

Opening Fire

They opened machine guns and fired, and at the same time sent a small boat to chase after it. At this time, the Shengjing ship realized the actions of the Japanese warship and stopped immediately. The Japanese small boat towed the Shengjing to the Mitsubishi Wharf (the Hongkou Wharf north of the Garden Bridge, now renamed Dongya Marine Transport Co., Ltd.), and after a while, it sailed to Zhanghuabang to dock. Doctors, customs officers, and others boarded the ship, and then it set sail again towards Wusong.

Ordered to Export

It was exported at 4:30 PM and berthed at Sanjiashui. The Taikoo Company received the report. Since they had not heard anything beforehand, they are currently investigating. According to news from the Japanese Navy, the ship had military supplies from Tianjin to Shanghai, and the Japanese Navy should inspect it. It was detained because it did not obey the order when the flags were raised in two places. Another message said

Loaded with Military Supplies

The military supplies brought by the ship this time were French military supplies. The Tianjin Customs had already received a report beforehand. After receiving the report from Tianjin, the Japanese Navy stationed in this city should have inspected it according to regulations. Yesterday, when the ship entered the port, it did not pay attention to the flags raised by the Japanese Navy, which caused a misunderstanding and it was detained. The situation should not escalate. However, passengers were frightened when they saw the Japanese warship opening fire and being detained and then sailing out of Wusong Port to berth. There is no definite news on whether the ship can enter the port today.

### British Army Detains Fake Police; Has Been Resolved; Will Be Released After Verification

The Zi Lin Bao said that an incident that almost caused another international dispute recently occurred in western Shanghai. It was resolved peacefully by the British military authorities and the "Municipal Government." The incident occurred at around 10:00 PM on Thursday of last week, when a British patrol saw a Chinese man in Western clothes walking around on Avenue Haig carrying a handgun. The British army arrested him and escorted him to the British army sentry post on Avenue du Grald, where he was questioned. Before arriving at the sentry post, the Chinese man showed his credentials, claiming that he worked in the "Municipal Police Bureau." The British army released him and told him that he had to wear a uniform if he wanted to enter the British defense zone with a firearm, to avoid being detained. The matter was concluded after a detailed explanation.

### British Soldiers Entering the French Concession is Not Prohibited; The British and French Defense Forces in this City Are Still at Peace

After France's surrender to Germany, the situation in the European war has undergone a special transformation. In the Battle of Oran, Britain and France actually became enemies. At a time when relations between Britain and France are on the verge of bankruptcy, the situation in this city is inevitably affected due to the presence of British and French defense forces. Not long ago, after Italy joined the war on Germany's side, the leaders of the defense forces of various countries in this city met together to avoid friction between soldiers of various parties and agreed that soldiers of the Italian defense forces should not enter the French Concession without authorization, and French soldiers should not enter the Italian military defense zone. Subsequently, the authorities of all parties strictly controlled the situation and lived in peace. After Britain and France became enemies, rumors spread that the British defense force authorities had ordered that soldiers not in uniform were not allowed to go to the French Concession for recreation. According to a British officer, the rumors are completely untrue. The British and French military authorities have not issued the above order.

### Traffic on the Border Road of North Henan Road to Open Tomorrow; Announced by the British Embassy in Shanghai; The Result of Negotiations Between Three Parties

The British Embassy in Shanghai announced that according to the results of the British Army's joint discussions with the Japanese Marine Corps and the Public Works Bureau, it has been decided to open the obstacles at the junction of North Henan Road and the Border Road on July 11. The opening hours are from 5:00 AM to 10:00 PM every day.

### Shanghai Volunteer Corps Strengthens Its Forces

Since the expansion of the European war, the concession authorities have become more stringent in maintaining security in the concession. In order to enrich the organization and strengthen its forces, the Shanghai Volunteer Corps is actively recruiting new members to assist in defense. According to the group's announcement, the British equestrian team and "A" team added 14 and 17 members respectively last week. In addition, 17 old members left the team for various reasons last week, and 47 new recruits were added to replace them.

### Dong Chunbiao's Coffin was Placed Yesterday

The body of accountant Dong Chunbiao, who was assassinated, was placed in a coffin at the Paradise Funeral Home at 3:00 PM on the 9th. On that day, many Shanghai accountants, celebrities, and relatives and friends of the Dong family went to pay their respects. Everyone was in tears because Dong died unexpectedly.

Deeply Mourning

According to yesterday's report, the murderer confessed that he lived in western Shanghai and was "ordered" to assassinate Tao Leqin and mistakenly killed Dong. Since there are clues in this case, it is not difficult to investigate it thoroughly. It is hoped that the concession authorities will not be afraid of difficulties and will conduct a thorough investigation to comfort Dong's spirit. Dong was a native of Yinxian County, Zhejiang Province. He graduated from the Accounting Department of Fudan University in his early years. He was

Upright and Frank

He was kind and amiable in his dealings with people. He devoted his life to his career and was not interested in political life. He previously co-founded an accounting firm with accountant Jiang Wanping. Now he has founded Daxin Bank at 264 Jiangxi Road. He usually obeyed the law and kept himself clean. He was very desolate after his death. He left behind one son and two daughters. After the tragedy occurred, Mrs. Dong was so grieved that she wanted to die.

### Seventh Batch of Low-Priced Coal Briquettes to be Sold, Starting Tomorrow

The Shanghai City Mechanized Coal Briquette Trade Association, after its 37th joint meeting of factory representatives, resolved to allow the seventh round of low-priced coal briquette sales to begin on the 11th of this month, starting at 2:00 PM daily, while supplies last. Each person is limited to purchasing three jiao worth of national currency per day, equivalent to five shi jin of briquettes, which works out to six yuan per dan. All low-priced briquettes are supplied by ten factories including Yitai Xing, Nanyang, Guohua, Dongfang, Jinghua, Gongyong, Huacheng Zuji, Yuedong, Hongji, and Lixing. There are a total of fifty sales locations in the two concessions, with twenty-eight in the International Settlement and twenty-two in the French Concession. The addresses have been listed for public notice.

### Japanese and French Police Raid Yongji Lane

Yesterday evening around 8:00 PM, Japanese personnel, together with Chinese and Western detectives from the French police, arrived in three cars at Yongji Lane on Wangzhi Road in the French Concession. They searched the residents of the lane house by house for a considerable time, but ultimately found nothing.

### Italian Consulate Denies Racial Discrimination Order, but Italian Soldiers No Longer Seen in Jewish Caf√©s

The Continental Daily News reported that rumors of an Italian-issued racial discrimination order extending to Shanghai have been denied by the Italian authorities here. According to the Italian consulate, the authorities have not instructed Italian expatriates to refrain from trading with Jews in the city. Although the Italian consulate has denied the previous statement, Italian naval personnel have not frequented German-Jewish caf√©s in Hongkou since Sunday.

### Procuring Rice in Jinhua to Aid Shaoxing Disaster Relief; Epidemics Rampant in Shaoxing

The Shaoxing Disaster Relief Association, under the auspices of the Shaoxing Fellow-Countrymen Association, received a telegram yesterday from Lu Zhinan, chairman of the Shaoxing disaster relief area. The original telegram read, "Understood your message." Rice from Jiangxi is difficult to obtain. The previous 160,000 yuan is being used to purchase and transport rice from Jinhua and other places. Continued remittances are also possible. Furthermore, epidemics are rampant in Shaoxing. Is it possible to allocate funds for relief? Reply by telegram. According to those in charge of the disaster area relief association, due to the current extraordinary circumstances, Jiangxi is strictly prohibiting the export of grain. Therefore, even purchasing in the name of the relief association is difficult to achieve. It is believed that purchasing from Jinhua and other places in Zhejiang will not pose a problem. As for prices, white rice transported from Jinhua to Shaoxing will cost no more than approximately 30 yuan per bag, which is much cheaper than foreign rice purchased in Shanghai. This is also the reason why this association does not advocate purchasing foreign rice in Shanghai for transport to Shaoxing for relief. The association, having learned of the rampant epidemics in Shaoxing, has decided to solicit donations of a large quantity of epidemic prevention drugs from fellow countrymen and enthusiastic individuals from all walks of life for transport to Shaoxing for relief. It is also understood that the price of rice in Shaoxing previously reached a peak of 140 yuan per shi. Recently, due to the efforts of the authorities and the relief association, the price has returned to around 95 yuan per shi. However, the rice shortage is severe and has not been alleviated.

### Airmail to Europe Can Be Routed Through the San Francisco Route; Must Be Noted in English on the Envelope; Acceptance of Parcels Via Italy Suspended

The Shanghai Postal Administration announced that, as approved by the American Postal Service's telegram, airmail from China to various European countries can be sent via Pan American Airways' Hong Kong-San Francisco air route to the United States, and then via the company's Atlantic air route to Europe. It is understood that airmail transported via the above-mentioned route will arrive in Europe in approximately fifteen days. In addition to paying the regular postage, an additional five yuan and forty cents of national currency per five grams must be paid for airmail postage from Hong Kong via the United States to Europe. All airmail destined for countries such as the United Kingdom, France, Switzerland, Spain, and Portugal, if the above-mentioned postage has been paid in full, and if the sender has noted on the envelope, "By Pan American Airways Service Via U. S. A.", will be sent via the Pan American Airways route through Hong Kong and the United States. This announcement is hereby made.

Since Italy's entry into the war and the order to halt Italian ships, the Shanghai Post Office has already announced the suspension of accepting parcels from Shanghai to Italy or transiting through Italy, and has informed the public accordingly.

### Japanese Car Attempting to Enter the Concession Blocked

After a standoff of more than twenty minutes, the car turned back. Yesterday morning at 10:05 AM, a "No. 53" car, driven by a Japanese person, attempted to enter the concession through the gate at the vehicle entrance/exit of Xinjiao Street on Avenue Edward VII. The French police there stopped it. Unexpectedly, after the Japanese person got out of the car, he went to the nearby "Japanese military police station on Rue Lo Hsiang Yuen" and summoned several Japanese military police officers to argue with the French patrol. However, the French police firmly refused to let it pass. The Japanese person then parked the car next to the gate, blocking all vehicles from Nanshi from entering the concession. After a standoff of about twenty minutes, the French police telegraphed the French police station and dispatched senior police officers to the scene to argue. At 10:30 AM, the Japanese person finally drove the car back to Avenue Edward VII and drove east. The reason for the obstruction is not yet clear.

### Summary of Important News

According to a report from the Shanghai Power Company, since the implementation of daylight saving time, the savings in electricity, viewed from the perspective of overall consumption, is extremely small, only about two or three percent.

The Refugee Relief Association appeals to all sectors to continue sponsoring refugees. (1) Those who have already participated in sponsorship are requested to extend the sponsorship period. (2) Those who have not yet participated in sponsorship are requested to participate as soon as possible. (3) If relatives and friends have spare capacity, they are urged to persuade others nearby to participate in sponsorship. (4) The cost of sponsoring refugees has been newly set at four yuan per person per month due to rising prices (those who previously sponsored at two yuan per month will continue to be charged as previously agreed).

### Current Financial Statements of Shanghai Commercial Banks

Shanghai's banks, in light of the continuing domestic war and the increasingly unstable world political situation, believe that under these circumstances, all operations must be as conservative as possible and increase reserves in order to live up to the trust of customers. When the overall situation stabilizes in the future, they will naturally seek to expand their business steadily based on their experience in serving society. Therefore, each bank can obtain a profit when handling its annual financial statements, as was also the case with the financial statements for the first half of the 29th year of the Republic. The net profits of each bank are recorded below:

### Rice Industry to Order 100,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Within Ten Days; Hong Kong-Annam Shipping Resumes; Opportunity to Order Rice Should Not Be Missed

The authorities of the two Shanghai concessions, in view of the recent soaring rice prices, which have had a significant impact on people's food supply, have convened a meeting of rice industry leaders yesterday (9th) at 2:30 PM in the boardroom of the Shanghai Municipal Council on Jiangxi Road. The attendees included rice industry representatives Cao Xinggeng, He Quansheng, Fang Yusheng, Xie Zhuoqun, Liu Liugu, He Xianggu, Chen Shide, Chen Ziyi, Chen Yinsheng, Yan Xiaoquan, Zhu Youzhang, She Bingwen, Zhu Zixiang, Cao Xuyuan, Zhu Xiangsheng, Zhou Zhizhen, and others, as well as Chinese Director Yu Qiaqing, members of the Municipal Council's Food Management Committee Yao Ke, Pisuahua, and Beitexun, and representatives of the French Concession's Public Works Bureau's Food Management Committee Xu Bai, Beilieai, and Zhao Zhiyou. Chairman De Kui, Deputy General Manager of the Municipal Council, persuaded the various rice industry groups to purchase more foreign rice to increase reserves and ensure the people's food supply. Subsequently, rice industry representative Chen Ziyi stated that the current rice industry is willing to cooperate with the authorities to order more foreign rice to regulate the people's food supply.

Order 100,000 Bags Within Ten Days

Chinese Director Yu Qiaqing then stated that various rice industry groups should order as much foreign rice as possible so that the city's rice reserves can be replenished and people's hearts can be stabilized. As a result, the rice industry representatives unanimously agreed to jointly order 100,000 bags of foreign rice (excluding broken rice) from abroad within ten days, with a deadline for shipment to Shanghai. A small committee will be organized by the rice industry groups to be responsible for handling the matter. In the future, after the rice arrives in Shanghai, it will be sold at cost plus 10%. When the foreign rice arrives in Shanghai, the police of the two concessions will provide special protection to reduce losses on the docks and in the warehouses.

Opportunity to Order Rice Should Not Be Missed

Finally, Xu Bai, representative of the French Concession Food Committee, expressed the opinion that in previous years, about 7 million bags of rice were transported from Siam and Annam to Europe each year. Due to the war in Europe, this has completely stopped. Therefore, the rice reserves in these places are currently very abundant and the prices are low. It would be most cost-effective for Shanghai rice merchants to order foreign rice from these places at this time. At the same time, the authorities of the two concessions hope that the city's major stores, now that shipping between Hong Kong and Annam has resumed and the price of foreign rice is relatively low, can also order foreign rice in groups so that the city's rice prices can gradually return to normal.

First Evaluation by the Price Evaluation Committee

The Shanghai Rice Price Evaluation Committee held its first meeting yesterday afternoon at 3:30 PM at its office at 15 Avenue Edward VII. Xie Xuefang from the French Concession Public Works Bureau, Zhong Jinchen from the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, and more than 20 committee members attended. The following resolutions were passed: (1) Regarding the proposal to assess the highest foreign rice prices from the 10th to the 12th, it was resolved that No. 1 Saigon/Siam rice would be 63.5 yuan, fire-milled 63 yuan, No. 2 Saigon/Siam rice 61.5 yuan, small-milled 61 yuan, high-grade Tokyo Japanese rice 59.5 yuan, Tokyo brown rice 56 yuan (all of the above were reduced by 2.5 yuan), rice green beans 53.5 yuan (reduced by 3.5 yuan), mixed broken rice 49 yuan (reduced by 4 yuan), and this would be implemented in the public market today. (2) Regarding the method for the industry to purchase rice in groups, it was resolved to follow the intentions of the concession authorities and have the rice industry colleagues gather to order 100,000 bags of foreign rice. A letter was immediately sent to various rice industry groups to notify their affiliated colleagues to contact the association to purchase rice and to appoint Song Youzhang, Cao Xinggeng, Chen Ziyi, Zhu Zixiang, Pan Zhenyu, He Quansheng, Chen Shide, He Xianggu, and Liu Liugu as members of the purchasing and solicitation committee to convene a meeting today to plan all the proceedings. The meeting adjourned at around 6:00 PM. The association also sent a letter to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday, notifying the various trade associations to participate in group rice purchases. Mr. Kui Yanfang also issued a letter to society, hoping to participate in group rice purchases to solve the people's food problem.

Soliciting Donations for Low-Priced Rice, Business Community Assists

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce received a letter from the Low-Priced Rice Association yesterday regarding the continued solicitation of donations for low-priced rice, requesting them to send letters to various industries, explaining the principle of mutual assistance and appealing for generous donations to maintain the livelihood of the people and protect the interests of the community. Because rice prices have continued to rise, this is the only way to slightly mitigate the crisis and protect the lives of the people. Businesses operating in Shanghai have a close relationship with the local order, and their interests are closely linked. They are earnestly urged to donate what they can. All donations received should still be sent directly to the Shanghai Zhongnan, Jincheng, and Tongrun Qianzhuang.

### After British Ships Resume Service to Vietnam, the Situation of Yunnan-Vietnam Transportation; Goods Transported to the Mainland via Vietnam Temporarily Suspended; Goods Sent to Haiphong/Saigon for Return are Rejected

The English-language "Great America Evening Post" reported that the British authorities imposed restrictions on British shipping last Saturday and Sunday, prohibiting British merchant ships from sailing to Vietnamese ports. These restrictions were lifted yesterday (8th), and coastal traffic between Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Haiphong will return to normal today (9th).

The situation in Hong Kong and Vietnam has eased, and the Hong Kong-Fang Line has resumed. The Shanghai-Fang Line is also preparing to resume service. The details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. However, the situation of traffic between Haiphong and the mainland is currently attracting much attention. According to a telegram from Haiphong received by a certain travel agency in the city, the details are as follows: After the French authorities allowed the Japanese army to send personnel to Vietnam to monitor transportation, the Hong Kong-Vietnam Line and the Shanghai-Fang Line were immediately suspended. It is now learned that the Japanese supervisors have arrived in Hanoi and are being dispatched to various strategic areas. Currently, goods transported to the mainland via Vietnam are temporarily suspended. As for goods previously transported to Fangong, if they are to be transported back to the place of origin,

It Is Also Rejected

Goods transported from the mainland to Hong Kong for export via Vietnam are normal. Passengers traveling from Vietnam to Yunnan are also subject to restrictions on their luggage, which can only be carried with them and cannot be shipped separately. However, passengers traveling from Yunnan to Vietnam are not subject to this restriction. A bridge 34 kilometers north of Hekou has been damaged (i.e., the previously reported destroyed railway bridge). The Yunnan-Vietnam railway train only runs slow trains as usual. The Michelin express train has been suspended. The Kunming-Hanoi air route is operating as usual. However, the exchange rates of Haiphong banks have not been announced, so the financial situation is slightly chaotic. What will happen in the future is difficult to predict.

### Two Young Men Suddenly Arrested in Dongchang Hotel; Japanese and Police Detectives Arrested Them Together; The Reason for the Arrest Has Not Yet Been Determined

At 3:40 PM the day before yesterday, two young travelers were suddenly arrested in the Dongchang Hotel at No. 5, Wufeng Lane, Lane 398, Avenue Joffre, by Japanese personnel and detectives from the French police. According to inquiries, the arrested were Zhou Xueming (24 years old) and his younger brother Zhou Xuecheng (20 years old) from Qingpu. They went to the hotel on the 3rd of this month and opened Room 30 to engage in the rice business, and later moved to Room 25. Suddenly, at around 3:40 PM the day before yesterday, six Japanese people in Western suits, together with Chinese and Western detectives from the French police, all armed with pistols, went to the hotel and entered Room 23 directly, arrested the Zhou brothers, handcuffed them, and took them away in a car that was parked at the entrance of the lane. At the time, they also took away one of Zhou's handbags. The reason for the arrest is unknown.

### Defendant Punished for Illegally Installing a Telephone

The Shanghai Telephone Company is currently experiencing a surge in users and an insufficient number of telephone lines, so users who want to install a telephone often cannot do so. As a result, various malpractices such as substitution and illegal installation have occurred. Moreover, most of the people handling these incidents are employees of the telephone company who are profiting from them. Although the telephone company authorities want to ban these practices, they lack evidence. Now, through the efforts of Chief Inspector Song Bingzheng and Detective Xue Ruilin of the Chinese Detective Branch of the Public Police Station, this situation has been uncovered. More than ten people involved have been found, most of whom are employees of the telephone company. The situation of the interrogation by the Special First Court has been recorded in this newspaper. This case has now concluded. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide announced the verdict in Criminal Court One. Hua Eryi was fined 1,500 yuan, Lin Yu and Wu Liren were each fined 1,000 yuan, Li Xinong was fined 500 yuan, Qian Bingxi was fined 450 yuan, Yang Tongyan was fined 400 yuan, Cai Wenhuan and Jiang Chengzhu were each fined 300 yuan, Cui Zhong (manager of Liwei Automobile Company) was fined 250 yuan, Lu Baoqiu was fined 100 yuan, and Shen Guoliang, Tang Shaoji, and He Fengji were found not guilty. If the fines are converted into labor service, they will be calculated at 3 yuan per day, or with a ratio of six months.

### Hurricane Lands in Fujian; Wind Force Has Weakened and Tends to Approach Jiujiang; Another Hurricane in the Pacific is Advancing Rapidly

The Xujiahui Observatory has learned that the hurricane that rose in the Pacific Ocean, after approaching Fuzhou, landed the day before yesterday between Fuzhou and Xiamen. After the hurricane landed, the wind force weakened and proceeded in a north-west direction, tending to approach Jiujiang. At 6:00 AM yesterday morning, according to a continuous report from the Observatory, after the hurricane landed, it had reached 27 degrees north latitude and 115 degrees east longitude yesterday morning, and then dissipated. Except for Manila and other places, the damage caused by the hurricane was not significant.

Wind Force Has Not Been Suppressed

The city was disturbed by whirlwind rains all day the day before yesterday. The wind force was still severe yesterday morning, indicating that the residual force of the hurricane was still present. Although the showers have stopped, the sky is still overcast. The Jianghai Customs lifted the sailing ban yesterday morning, allowing various ships to enter and depart. It is understood that another hurricane that rose in the Pacific Ocean one after another had reached 14 degrees north latitude and 136 degrees east longitude at 6:00 AM yesterday morning, with a north-west direction. The center of the wind force is within 120 nautical miles. Although it is still far from Shanghai, the Observatory and Customs are closely monitoring its development.

Shipping Resumes

Since the hurricane landed, the shipping on each line has resumed yesterday morning. Ruitalun of Hualun Shipping Company and Shantai Lun of Zhengde Company were both postponed yesterday from starting the trip from Shanghai to Ningbo. Yushenglun of Yihe Shipping Company has not arrived in Shanghai yesterday, and is expected to arrive today. The ship was originally scheduled to resume the Shanghai-Fang Line tomorrow, going from Shanghai to Haiphong via Hong Kong, so it is expected to be postponed as well. Haifu has also departed.

Hurricane Season Has Arrived

According to a reporter from Datong News Agency, the Jianghai Customs believes that the hurricane season has arrived this year, and Pacific hurricanes will continue to attack the Chinese coast. Shanghai is also one of the destinations for hurricane attacks. Therefore, in addition to preparing red lights and black balls to be hung at any time during the hurricane season to warn shipping merchants, the area around Lujiazui in Pudong is designated as a shelter for various civilian ships. At the same time, the Shanghai Dredging Bureau is deeply concerned that the coincidence of hurricanes and high tides will cause a considerable flood in Shanghai, so the Water Conservancy Department forecasts the amount, date, and time of high tides for prevention and water control. According to the experience of the Dredging Bureau, the chance of a hurricane coinciding with a high tide is only one in ten. Therefore, floods in Shanghai have not occurred frequently throughout history, which is why.

### Sentenced to One Year in Prison for Impersonating a Deaf-Mute and Committing Fraud

Li Tongfu from Ningbo, 32 years old, usually carries a donation book, pretends to be deaf-mute, and uses the name of the Blind and Deaf Arts and Crafts Institute to solicit donations from all walks of life. Many people have been deceived by him. On the afternoon of the 29th of last month, Li used the same trick again and attempted to defraud Zhou Nanxuan at No. 160 Avenue Edward VII of 50 yuan. He was arrested by the police and taken to the General Patrol Room along with the donation book and sent to the Special First Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Shi ascended to the Criminal Court Four and continued the interrogation. The court sentenced Li to one year of imprisonment, and the donation book and other items were confiscated. However, during the interrogation of this case, the School for the Blind and Deaf believed that the defendant's behavior was related to the reputation of the school, so it also sent a representative to the court to listen.

### Assassination Case in Pudong; Huang Yunti Dies from Gunshot Wounds

### Finance Foreign Exchange Settlement Becomes Active Sellers Reluctant to Release Holdings

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no change in HSBC's listed rates. In the unofficial British and American exchange markets, the trend continued to soften, mainly due to increased demand. In addition to speculative forces pushing up prices, Japanese banks were actively purchasing, and foreign firms were settling accounts. Sellers, seeing the trend, were reluctant to release their holdings, causing the American exchange rate to reach 8.25 yuan before noon. There was little change before the noon close. Later, as foreign firms showed intentions to supply, the market appeared to ease. However, speculators suddenly developed a strong appetite, causing the market to shift from soft to hard. As a result, the closing market tightened. Ultimately, British gold closed at 3 shillings and 96.875 pence, and the American exchange rate closed at 6.1875 yuan, each down 0.03125 and 0.0625 respectively compared to the previous day's close. The difference between the spot price for July and the spot price has gradually narrowed. Transactions for August have already taken place, with prices the same as the spot price.

Sassoon Aggressively Dumps Shillings

Early in the morning, London reported a large increase, nearly rising 0.0625. New York silver prices remained flat, and London raw gold remained stable. The British exchange rate against the American exchange rate was unchanged, against the Shanghai exchange rate it fell 0.03125, the American exchange rate against the British exchange rate fell half a point, against the Shanghai exchange rate it fell slightly. There was no market for the French exchange rate. The Central Bank was closed today for a holiday and there was no market. Banks opened with a spot selling price of 3 shillings and 96.875 pence for British gold and 6.21875 yuan for the American exchange rate, each down 0.03125 compared to the previous evening's close. Although Japanese banks, including Zhengjin and Mitsui, were actively purchasing after the opening, foreign banks were quite willing to supply, so the market remained stable. However, the American exchange rate initially reached 6.1875 yuan. Later, Japanese banks, including Zhengjin, bid at 6.21875 yuan. Subsequently, Sassoon aggressively dumped, and prices showed a slight hardening. Spot shillings were sold to foreign banks at 3 shillings 96.875 pence to 98.4375 pence. The HSBC listed rates were unchanged, and there was no increase or decrease in the silver equalization tax. After this, Chinese banks also sold, and the American exchange rate reached 6.25 yuan. In addition, speculators entered the market for new transactions in August, bidding for American exchange at 6.125 yuan. By around 11:00 AM, Japanese banks were again absorbing, and the market tightened. The American exchange rate for July was bid by Japanese banks at 6.1875 yuan, and the spot American exchange rate was purchased by foreign firms at 6.1875 and 6.15625 yuan, even briefly reaching 6.125 yuan. Therefore, the American exchange rate for August was reduced to 6.09375 and 0.0625 by speculators entering the foreign exchange market. However, the market remained stable at the noon close. The spot American exchange rate closed at 6.1875 yuan, and British gold closed at 3 shillings 95.3125 pence, with the American exchange rate tightening by 0.03125 and British gold softening by 0.015625 compared to the morning opening. Futures also declined.

August Contracts Already Opened

In the afternoon, foreign firms and American banks sold considerably. Although there were still speculators bidding, the market ultimately showed signs of hardening. Initially, foreign firms purchased spot shillings at 3 shillings 96.875 pence, and Hong Kong Electric bid for forward-month American exchange at 6.125 yuan. Later, the Dutch sold July American exchange at 6.21875 yuan to Chinese banks. However, before the close, speculators absorbed July American exchange, causing it to soften back to 6.1875 yuan. At the close, British gold was at 3 shillings 96.875 pence, and the American exchange rate was at 6.1875 yuan. July British gold was at 3 shillings 95.3125 pence, and the American exchange rate was at 6.15625 yuan. August British gold was at 3 shillings 90.625 pence, and the American exchange rate was at 6.09375 yuan. Compared to the previous day, the spot British exchange rate softened by 0.03125, and the American exchange rate tightened by 0.0625. July British exchange rate softened slightly by 0.015625, and the American exchange rate tightened by 0.0625.

### Profit-Taking Not Uncommon Gold Market's Rise Hindered Wavering Around 5,200 Yuan Throughout the Day

Yesterday's dark market for cash gold bullion continued to show a firm trend, but those who had purchased at low prices earlier were eager to sell for profit, hindering the rise. The result was the same as the previous day's close. The buying and selling process was quite active. Initially, market sentiment was scattered, and the opening price was only 5,180 yuan. After banks and gold firms vigorously entered the market, the price reached 5,225 yuan. Subsequently, a certain bank and retail investors sold, causing the price to fall to a low of 5,155 yuan. Fortunately, securities firms, gold firms, etc., vigorously entered the market, and the price created a high of 5,265 yuan before noon. The noon close retreated slightly, and the after-market remained high. However, the banks suddenly took profit, immediately pushing the price down to 5,160 yuan. A certain money exchange firm swallowed the entire amount, raising the price to 5,210 yuan. The market ultimately closed at 5,190 yuan. Approximately two thousand several hundred taels were traded throughout the day. Gold jewelry at silverware shops was listed at ten yuan lower, while customs gold, etc., remained flat.

Gold Bullion Closes at Previous Price

From the morning, the price per bar (ten taels) was initially reported flat due to stable foreign exchange, and market sentiment was slightly tired. There were many sellers at the opening, so the price was pushed down by ten yuan. Banks did twenty taels of mutual trading at 5,180 yuan. Subsequently, banks, gold firms, and a certain money exchange firm were happy to absorb at the lower price, and sellers at that time decreased, leading to an increase of forty-five yuan. Banks released thirty taels to securities firms at 5,225 yuan. After this, the foreign exchange market weakened again slightly, and banks and retail investors sold off, causing the price to fall back into the 5,200 yuan range. Gold firms released twenty taels to money exchange firms at a discount of 5,155 yuan. Then, foreign exchange tightened again, stimulating buying, and banks and securities firms competed to absorb, and short sellers covered their positions. Soon, the price jumped by one hundred and ten yuan. Securities firms entered ten taels to gold firms, raising the price to 5,265 yuan. At noon, the foreign exchange market hardened slightly, buying sentiment dissipated, and cash gold firms took advantage of the high price to sell off, ultimately seeing a decline of thirty yuan. Gold firms released twenty taels to banks, retreating to 5,235 yuan, as the noon close price. The afternoon opening was slightly higher, with banks doing ten taels of mutual trading at 5,245 yuan. However, the banks tended to sell off after this, and gold firms and retail investors followed suit, soon breaking into the 5,200 yuan range. Securities firms released ten taels to banks, falling to 5,160 yuan. Fortunately, a certain money exchange firm vigorously bought again and again, and a certain gold firm also absorbed, soon recovering fifty yuan. Banks entered twenty taels to gold firms at 5,210 yuan. With fewer buyers later, and securities firms selling off continuously, the price fell back twenty yuan. Gold firms entered thirty taels to banks at 5,190 yuan, as the evening close price. The result was the same as the previous day, with fluctuations of one hundred and ten yuan throughout the day. The selling price of spot gold bullion at cash gold firms was several tens of yuan higher than that of bullion, and the buying price was thirty yuan lower. The current standard gold was more than fifty yuan lower than the listed gold, and very few transactions took place.

Gold Jewelry Listed at Ten Yuan Lower

The initial selling price of gold jewelry per tael at silverware shops remained at 540 yuan at Datonghang. At 10:00 AM, the price was lowered by ten yuan. At 11:45 AM, it was lowered by a large amount. At 3:20 PM in the afternoon, it was lowered by ten yuan again. Datonghang's revised price was 530 yuan. The price at new silverware shops was similar to the previous price, with a buying price reduced by around thirty yuan.

### The Financial Industry of Gulangyu

(Gulangyu Correspondence) Xiamen is a small island, a port for overseas Chinese to enter and exit, and a distribution center for goods. Before the war, banks were everywhere, mainly to absorb deposits from overseas Chinese. They did not pay much attention to loans. During the period of prosperity in Xiamen's construction in the Republic of China years 21 and 22, various financial institutions invested heavily in real estate loans. Unfortunately, in year 23, they were affected by the global recession, and real estate prices fell, resulting in considerable losses. They stopped advancing in real estate loans. As for warehouse mortgages, because Xiamen's position is a transshipment port, and the goods needed locally are limited, there have always been very few warehouses. Such mortgages have been rarely operated, only slightly engaging in import and export mortgages. Credit loans for industry and commerce were also limited to a small number of loans, so most of the deposits received were transferred to Shanghai for use. After Xiamen fell, fortunately, the banks moved to Gulangyu early, so the losses were relatively small. However, due to the impact of the shutdown of various businesses, operations were very sluggish. Until last autumn, the inflow of funds from overseas Chinese increased sharply. In addition, after the opening of transportation between Gulangyu and the mainland, goods from Shanghai and Hong Kong were transferred from Gulangyu to Jinzhou in the interior, and goods from the interior were also transferred from Zhangzhou to Gulangyu for distribution to Shanghai. The import goods included rice, flour, grains, cloth, groceries, and fertilizer, with fertilizer being the most important. The export goods were mainly fruits and sugar. Gulangyu has suddenly replaced the former Xiamen as a distribution center for goods, and the financial center has also shifted to Gulangyu.

Regarding foreign exchange, because Gulangyu has a special status, buying and selling are free. Foreign exchange prices are based on the Shanghai and Hong Kong markets. The local prices of Hong Kong dollars and American gold notes often differ greatly from the selling prices, manipulated by small money shops and speculators, depending entirely on the market's supply and demand balance. Recently, some banks and money shops, solely for the purpose of making profits, disregard the livelihood of the people and lack a national concept, and have invested in the mortgage lending and lending of Hong Kong dollars, American gold, and British gold. They can obtain funds for the mortgage of goods from illegal merchants, accumulate goods, monopolize and profiteer, causing prices to rise endlessly. This is truly regrettable.

Regarding the situation of Shanghai Exchange, supply and demand usually match each other, and the exchange rate does not fluctuate much, usually standing at around 1,001 yuan, that is, Xiamen pays 1,001 yuan and Shanghai receives 1,000 yuan in legal tender. In the past two months, due to speculators competing to purchase goods and a large amount of goods being imported into the mainland, the demand for Shanghai Exchange in the mainland has exceeded supply, so the exchange rate has gradually risen. Merchants transfer funds to Gulangyu to exchange for Shanghai Exchange. In addition, the arbitrage profit of foreign exchange in Shanghai is extremely high, and there is no investment in funds stored in Gulangyu, so all banks are unwilling to sell Shanghai Exchange in large quantities, and there is also an imbalance in supply and demand. On the 3rd of this month, the Shanghai Exchange rate reached a peak of 130 yuan per thousand, breaking the historical record. Currently, due to the mainland's prohibition of large quantities of goods from being imported and restrictions on the transfer of funds to Gulangyu, and it is heard that Xiamen is using its special circumstances to transport cash to Shanghai in order to profit, amounting to four to five million, due to the above reasons, the price of Shanghai Exchange has gradually fallen, standing at around 1,040 yuan. Looking forward to the future of the Shanghai Exchange rate, because the Shanghai money market is extremely tight and the arbitrage profit of foreign exchange is high, the impact may be difficult to reach the price of around 1,001 yuan in the past.

### Securities Public Debt Market Stable

The black market for securities saw several types of securities recover slightly yesterday, but trading was exceptionally light. Some of this was due to price manipulation, as the exchange does not charge commissions in this black market. Regarding the environment, positive news has gradually subsided. The only hope for the bulls is the ninth interest payment. It is known that after the government announced a temporary suspension of principal and interest payments in June of the 28th year of the Republic of China, the principal and interest of the seventh and eighth periods were temporarily converted to remittance by the Central Bank, China Bank, and Bank of Communications, and paid in monthly installments over six months, totaling over 100 million yuan. The principal and interest of the current ninth period still require 60 to 70 million yuan. Whether these banks will continue to advance the funds has not been formally announced. This is a matter of great importance, and it is hoped that it will be announced soon to maintain stability. Yesterday morning, Renchang bought and Lianhe sold, and the market was flat and weak. There was very little trading in the afternoon, and the bulls took advantage of this to raise prices. Type A securities could reach 62 yuan. The results were that Types D and E fell slightly, while the rest recovered, with no consistency. The total turnover was estimated at over 300,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.

In stock trading, 200 shares of Zhabei Water and Electricity stock were traded at a price of 6 yuan.

Yesterday, the public utility stock market opened quietly. Subsequently, rubber stocks rose first due to continuous purchases by investors and speculators, and the market quickly became firm, with prices rising by about 10%. The trading volume was quite large. Near the morning close, profit-takers competed to close out their positions, and the rising trend was instantly stopped. Industrial stocks also had a potential for firmness, but prices changed little.

London, 8th (Monday) Dispatch: Today's listed prices for Far East British companies' stocks were generally flat. Only the Hong Kong-registered shares of HSBC rose by one pound to 66 pounds. The rest were unchanged.

London, 8th (Monday) Dispatch: Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign debts remained stable, with no change in prices for any of the upper or lower grade securities.

### Yarn and Cotton Large Cotton Yarn Dealers Continue to Sell at High Prices

The yarn market remains stable and trending upward. This is because actual sales are good. South China Hong Kong brokers have good sales for 10-count and 20-count yarns. The Ningbo side continues to purchase relentlessly, so sentiment is strong and the market is gradually improving.

Spot yarn opened this morning continuing the previous day's momentum and continued to rise. The opening price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was 930 yuan. As soon as this price opened, a certain large dealer continued to sell, and market sentiment was hit again, suddenly falling back to 820 yuan. However, it was then heard that sales were active on the customer side, and 10-count coarse yarn trading was very strong, improving sentiment, and the market recovered to 929 yuan at the close. The trading volume for half a day was 1,940 bales. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn rose by 9 yuan. The amount of each broker's purchase is listed as follows:

Brokers 860 Xiamen 10 Mainland 40 Ningbo 180 Hong Kong 830 Total 1,940

### Increased American Cotton Acreage

Washington, 8th Dispatch: The initial report on the acreage planted with American cotton this year is 25,077,000 acres, an increase of 390,000 acres compared to the same time last year.

The spot cotton business remains ordinary, but Japanese factories are slightly purchasing, which is only a decoration. As for Chinese factories, most have sufficient reserves. In addition, the yarn market has not been very good, so they are not very interested in replenishing raw materials. The power of market price increases is very weak. American cotton is at 260 yuan, with Japanese factories purchasing 100 bales. Indian cotton is at 175 yuan, with Japanese merchants purchasing 500 bales.

Foreign cotton market prices: In the New York cotton market, prices initially rose due to purchases by the industry, but then fell due to good weather reports and sales by Wall Street firms. The closing prices were up 89 points for the near month and down 56 points for the far month. The Indian price yesterday, including forecasts, fell by a large amount of 6 rupees.

Shanghai's foreign cotton trading has been slightly looser in recent days, but this is limited to sporadic transactions by Japanese factories, which are not significant. However, this has already symbolized a slight turnaround in the cotton market. The Chinese factories, on the other hand, remain unusually quiet.

### Piece Goods Cotton Cloth Sales Become Active Selling Prices Also See Slight Increase

Domestic Cloth Yesterday's market saw active spot sales and a willingness to absorb byÂõ§Êà∑ (speculators who hoard goods). Selling prices all turned firm. White cloth, Fugui and Dapeng brands of fine cloth, and twill cloth each rose by 2.5 Ëßí (cents) per bolt. Yihua coarse cloth rose by 1-2.5 Ëßí (cents). The output from other factories remained at the original level. Intentions to purchase are strong. The decline in bleached and dyed cloth has also stopped. Transactions were most active by traders from Êú¨Ë°ó (local street) and the Wenningbo traders from eastern Zhejiang. Guerrilla areas in Ningbo, Wuhu, and Hangzhou were second. The total turnover was estimated to be over a thousand pieces of white cloth, twill cloth, coarse cloth, and fine cloth, and 450 pieces of bleached and dyed printed cloth.

Eastern Cloth 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth opened at 28.4-28.5 yuan per bolt in the morning, and the closing price rose by 5.5 Ëßí (cents). Four Gentlemen serge was 8.4 Ëßí (cents) per yard and also recovered by 1 ÂàÜ (cent). However, actual customer sales remained extremely weak.

Exports 110 pieces of cotton cloth were shipped to Yantai today, 60 pieces were shipped to Weihaiwei, and 450 pieces were shipped to Ningbo yesterday (8th).

### Grains Rice Prices Fall Back

The rice market saw speculators and scattered individual investors in a difficult situation, lacking the will to manipulate. They were eager to release their holdings. At the same time, original brokers also believed that the overall situation was gone, and they poured out all their holdings. Buyers did not dare to prepare too much. The total sales of the city decreased sharply compared to usual, while the sales volume actually increased. Therefore, the prices of all goods continued to plummet, with the closing price falling sharply by two or three yuan compared to before. Transactions remained few, less than 10,000 bags. The closing price for number 1 old Saigon was only 63 yuan and 62.6 yuan, new top was 62 yuan and 61.5 yuan, number 2 was 61.2 yuan and 61 yuan, number 1 Siam was 63 yuan and 62.5 yuan, number 2 was 61 yuan, fire twist was 62 yuan and 61.5 yuan, Hong Kong top was 61.5 yuan and then 60 yuan, small twist top still had good sales channels and could still open at 61 yuan and 60.05 yuan, Tokyo polished top was initially 58.5 yuan and then 55.5 yuan, broken top was 48.5 yuan and then rice chaff was 44 yuan, rice green was 51.5 yuan and then 49.5 yuan. The foreign rice futures market plummeted more strongly. Yinghua Company's immediate delivery of Siam number 1 rice was 74 yuan, then 71.7 yuan, the 20th-loaded was 71.5 yuan then 70 yuan, and the 16th-loaded was 71 yuan then 69.5 yuan, a sharp drop of yuan compared to before. The total futures trading in the market was 500 tons.

Glutinous rice alone remained firm due to scarcity, and the selling price remained similar to before. Frequent deliveries of regular and thick rice from domestic farms led to quiet trading outside the market, and prices depreciated by yuan. Changbang special clean japonica was 73.5 yuan and 73 yuan, Changzhou Sukun white japonica was 70 yuan and then old was 69 yuan, Qing Si thin rice was 71.2 yuan, Nan Gang early special was 70 yuan and then old was 68 yuan, Hu Jian was 66.7 yuan.

### Large Quantities of Foreign Flour Arriving - Market Already Easing Yesterday - Chinese Merchants Ordering Foreign Wheat

Flour: The flour market showed signs of easing yesterday. The quoted price of Flour Mill No. 2 remained at $15.20. Fuxin Mill had not yet started production, and only Fufeng maintained actual sales in this area, mainly supplying noodle and pastry businesses. Retail buyers had long been unable to purchase it, leading to an influx of miscellaneous domestic flour in the market. Even the flour dealers mostly supplied domestic flour. Yesterday, transactions in this area for brands like Green Phoenix, NËÖª Golden Mountain, Double Lions, and Johnson amounted to approximately 7,000 to 8,000 bags. However, the market was affected by the continuous supply of domestic flour and rumors that over four million bags of foreign flour had been ordered from North China, Tianjin, in recent months. Over 200,000 bags have also been ordered in this area, expected to arrive in Shanghai soon, priced at around $15.20. As a result, the market was considerably influenced. The opening price for Phoenix Flour August futures was $16.30 but quickly eased to $16.15, lacking buyers. Spot prices also dropped by 10 cents. Other brands also saw similar price decreases.

Wheat: There was no official market price yesterday as it was difficult to transport goods from various regions into the foreign concessions. Japanese mills found it easier to purchase wheat, while Chinese mills faced difficulties. It is said that Chinese mills have newly ordered Australian foreign wheat by ship, priced slightly above $30. Although there were also rumors of Japanese mills ordering foreign wheat, grain merchants mentioned that Japanese mills could easily purchase wheat currently and did not need foreign wheat for supplementation.

### Sugar Market: Coarse White Continues to Rise

Yesterday, the sugar market continued to rise. The association's prices for spot goods: the current price for grade 24 coarse white sugar was called at $68.40 to $68.50 at the local warehouse and $67.90 to $68 at outside warehouses, both increasing by 50 cents. Transshipment goods for delivery on the 20th were priced at $54.20 to $54.30, with warehouse receipts at $53.60 to $53.80, both increasing by 30 cents. Dutch red sugar was at $57.50, up by 50 cents. Only Xinghua provided 61 bags of Da Gong flour domestic sugar at a price of $90. Another 3,000 bags of sugar are being shipped to Qingdao today.

### Oilcake and Oil Market Stir Again; Soybean Cake Also Being Stockpiled

Soybean Oil: After a market downturn, although there was no large-scale purchasing yesterday, the small-scale sales were still active, causing the market to fluctuate. A total of 70 barrels of Dalian soybean oil were traded at $101.50, 150 barrels of Qingdao soybean oil at $100.05, 20 pieces of Jiaozhou soybean oil at $71, and 200 cans of Jiangbei soybean oil at $92. The above were all distributed by local dealers and domestic buyers.

Raw Oil: 500 cans of Yantai oil were purchased for export at $90, 1,000 cans of Jiangbei local mill oil at $100, and 50 pieces of Liaozhou road goods at $67.

Soybean Cake: Yesterday, Xinghua stockpilers purchased over 10,000 pieces of Da You's Four Brand cake at $13.60. Domestic buyers inquired about Shengji cake for 500 pieces at $12.55. The Shantou gang dragged in one cart of Feizi cake at $12.50 and two carts of Yuanlong cake at $12.40.

### Silk Tea Factories Face Heavy Burden

Yesterday, the overseas silk market was sluggish, with minimal fluctuations in Japan and the United States. The New York Stock Exchange traded only 22 lots in one day. Local silk market foreign firms and silk merchants are observing the situation. Currently, silk transported from inland to Shanghai, besides the reported 12% special tax, also requires a freight charge of $300 per picul. Thus, each picul of raw silk bears nearly $800 in taxes. Recent news indicates that customs will also impose a 1% export tax on raw silk exports. Therefore, the silk market is extremely distressed. Currently, foreign firms are rushing to pack for export, but transactions for August and September deliveries are impossible to negotiate.

### Excerpt from Old Newspapers - 67 Years Ago - (440) - (See Shen Bao, Tongzhi Year 12 of the Late Qing Dynasty)

New Method of Water Production

Chinese people drink soup in winter and water in summer, following this custom. However, they only care about temperature and never consider regulating their "qi." Westerners enjoy drinking Dutch water and similar sweetened drinks. In summer, they often carry bottles for refreshment. I once tried it and felt a surge of fresh air in my chest, which then came out of my throat. After careful examination, I realized the water contains vitality, what Westerners call "carbonic acid gas," which makes it very effective. I heard that England used to produce this water and sell it to other countries for huge profits. Recently, Barney & Sons and Foster Company have produced water-making machines and sell them to other countries at low prices. People eagerly buy them. The capital investment is only a hundred or so taels, but the profits are endless. Even if Chinese people do not want to drink this water, it will gradually become popular. If we buy it from others, wouldn't we be handing over profits? Moreover, having such a machine allows us to earn profits like Westerners. I heard that the machine has a lead container on the right. First, strong acid is used to dissolve marble to extract carbon from the stone, or anything with carbon dioxide. The gas is sealed into the container, which then injects it into a solid copper container. A person shakes a wheel, and something inside the container rotates rapidly, mixing the gas with the water. The water is then stored in bottles, and the water is made. If this is the case, wouldn't it be extremely convenient?

### Increased Meal Fees at the Poor Children's Home - Letter from Zheng Tielong with Attached Letter from the Home

Respected Sir/Madam: Amidst the economic panic, I suddenly received a notice from the Poor Children's Home requiring supplementary meal fees. As one of the introducers of poor children, I cannot afford to waive this agreement, nor can I afford to pay this fee on their behalf. Therefore, I specially request that this be made public in the newspaper, seeking public opinion.

The Shanghai Poor Children's Home, formerly known as the Chao Hui Poor Children's Home, was funded by surplus funds accumulated by Chaozhou merchants in Shanghai from transactions with foreigners, amounting to over one million yuan. The funds were stored with foreign merchants. When the Chaozhou people wanted to use the funds, the foreign merchants said that the funds were for public welfare purposes. Later, Mr. Guo Zibin and others planned to establish the Poor Children's Home, using the funds as a foundation to purchase property and build school buildings. The scale was quite large, enrolling poor children from the Chaozhou community, providing free admission, meals, lodging, and education, thus cultivating talents for society, which is admirable. However, admission procedures were based on introductions, subject to approval by the board of directors. The number of students approved was limited, with each director allowed to approve a certain number of students. Internal teachers and staff also adopted a hereditary system, and all income and expenses were handled by the director, without public disclosure, except to the board of directors. The internal situation was unknown to outsiders. Now it is claimed that rising prices have led to a monthly deficit of 10,000 yuan. This is the situation in today's society, and it is inappropriate to burden the families of poor children. Even if each student is charged 20 yuan, with 500 students, the total is 10,000 yuan, but how many of these 500 poor families can afford this fee? Therefore, it is said that if the fees are not paid, the home will have to close. This is inappropriate for public responsibility. It is hoped that the directors will seek appropriate solutions, either by increasing revenue and reducing expenditures, or by soliciting donations. There are many wealthy Chaozhou people in Shanghai, and it is hoped that the directors will advocate for countless poor children.

Attached is the letter from the home, respectfully requesting that it be published in the newspaper as well. Sincerely, Zheng Tielong

Esteemed Sir/Madam: In these extraordinary times, prices are rising daily. The Home's monthly expenses have reached 14,000 to 15,000 yuan, while the regular income remains at 5,000 yuan, resulting in a monthly deficit of 10,000 yuan, which is difficult to sustain, and we fear exhaustion. The Board of Directors has decided to implement remedial measures, starting this summer vacation, requiring each student to supplement meal fees of 20 yuan per semester, payable in advance at the Shanghai Bank branch on Yuyuan Road, Jing'an Temple, using the Home's triplicate form, and presenting the receipt for admission. Students must be picked up by their parents during summer and winter vacations. Those who must stay on campus must pay 20 yuan for meal fees during the two-month summer vacation and 10 yuan for the one-month winter vacation. In these difficult times, if we do not do so, we fear that the Home will have to temporarily close starting next semester. The above is for your information and consideration. The summer vacation starts on June 30th. We hope that your parents will pick up your children at the Home at that time. If you wish to stay on campus, please state the reasons in person and pay the supplementary meal fee of 20 yuan as soon as possible to reserve a summer vacation seat. Please do not delay. Sincerely,

Your Parents, Director Guo Shouchun

June 27, 29th Year

(Note: The triplicate payment form is being printed and will be sent later.)

Amateur Musings

### Determining One's Attitude Toward a Vocation

‚Äî Shi Wei

This is an unshakeable truth: in this world, no one can live alone, detached from others.

Consider a shoemaker who relies on making shoes for a living. On the surface, it seems he lives independently; however, the nails and hammer he uses to make shoes must be supplied by a blacksmith, and the leather and cloth must be purchased from a tannery and textile mill. Moreover, shoes cannot be eaten, so he must rely on others to buy his shoes and then use the money to buy rice and firewood...

This means everyone participates in the social division of labor. Whether one is a worker, clerk, teacher, doctor, editor, or even a rickshaw puller or trash collector... one cannot live otherwise. (This refers to the majority. On the other hand, women are still mostly confined to the home in our society.)

This also means that everyone must have a vocation. From a societal perspective, vocation is everyone's obligation and a sacred task.

Looking at the situation from the workers' perspective, isn't it astonishing? I dare say that 999 out of 1000 people adopt a dismissive or even hostile attitude toward their vocations. Haven't you heard complaints like "I complain about whatever I do" or "There's nothing to gain from this job" in the streets, tea houses, workshops, and shops?

Isn't this puzzling? If vocation is sacred, why do so many people look down on it?

The reason is quite simple: the social division of labor in our society today is not entirely rational. That is, our vocations cannot meet our basic needs. From this, we can understand the essence of the enormous undertaking that China is carrying out today. May everyone approach it with the utmost composure.

Then, how should we approach our vocations today, precisely today?

First, we must cherish our vocations and contribute our strength to them.

Second, we must transform our vocations. With a prudent attitude and reasonable steps, we must transform the irrational aspects of our industry or enterprise. On the other hand, we must study specialized skills and subjects because the new China urgently needs highly skilled sons and daughters.

Third, we must be steadfast in our vocations. Jumping from factory to factory or company to company will not solve our problems. As the saying goes, "The grass is always greener on the other side," isn't that right? Everyone should be patient and believe that when the light arrives, it will not only shine on the estate classroom but also on our workshop and shop.

Hawthorne's Case

### The Whereabouts of the Dance Queen

‚Äî Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter 3: Conflicting Information

A short, elderly man appeared at the door of the reception room. The man was around fifty years old, with graying hair and no beard. His thin, sallow face was adorned with small, round, mouse-like ears. He wore a black satin padded jacket and trousers, and his feet were shod in a pair of round-toed yellow leather shoes, though they were worn and covered in mud. He stood at the doorway, wanting to come in but seemingly hesitant. His mouth was open, revealing a few broken and sparse teeth, and his small eyes were wide, staring directly at Ni Jinshou. Ni Jinshou was about to stand up, but when he suddenly saw the man, he was clearly taken by surprise and sat back down. Composing himself, he straightened up.

He shouted, "Old Mao, what are you doing here? I told you to wait in the gatehouse. Who told you to come in?"

The watchman looked even more embarrassed. His hands moved back and forth, as if he didn't know where to put them. Fine beads of sweat appeared on his forehead, and his breathing quickened.

He stammered, "I‚ÄîI‚ÄîDetective‚ÄîI‚Äî"

Hawthorne quickly intervened, "Jinshou, please sit down. Let him come in and speak." He turned to the doorway. "Old Mao, come in, don't panic. What do you want to tell us?"

Old Mao dragged his feet across the floor, inch by inch, until he reached the edge of the carpet. His eyes circled the four people in the room.

He said haltingly, "Sir‚ÄîDetective‚ÄîI‚ÄîI shouldn't have come in, but I‚ÄîI have‚Äî"

Hawthorne took the cigarette from his lips and said gently, "Speak, what is it?"

"I have something to report." His lips trembled, and his body seemed unsteady.

"Don't be afraid, tell me, what do you want to report?"

"The murderer!"

As soon as those two words escaped the old man's mouth, it was as if a cold wind from the Arctic Ocean suddenly blew through the room. I couldn't help but be stunned. Ni Jinshou and the maid, Jinmei, were probably even more shocked than I was. Only Hawthorne remained calm, though he couldn't hide the sudden gleam of attention in his eyes. (40)

Edgar Bergen

### The Process of Inventing a Wooden Man

‚Äî Hui

Edgar Bergen is not only a ventriloquist known to every household in America but also a university graduate with great literary accomplishments. His past life was a history of extremely painful struggles. However, he finally used his extraordinary brainpower to open up a path - inventing the wooden man Charlie McCarthy. A simple report:

Inspiration for the Invention

According to Edgar Bergen, he discovered his own talent for emitting the voices of two people at the age of thirteen. Later, when he was studying in middle school, there was an Irish newsboy near the school who was constantly shouting and selling newspapers. One day, he suddenly had an inspiration and drew a design when he returned home, asking the carpenter McAllen to make a wooden man according to the design. The newsboy was called Charlie. After a moment of thought, Edgar gave his wooden man a name, Charlie McCarthy.

Brain Structure

The carpenter charged thirty-five dollars for the wooden man's head, and Edgar paid him in full. He made the wooden man's body himself. This gave Charlie a rough human shape. Initially, the wooden man's head was manipulated using rubber bands. His new brain was completed only four years ago, including two dry batteries, two hundred copper pieces, and countless zinc pieces. There are dozens of switches behind the brain, each with a different function. For example, making the wooden man's head shake, opening his eyes, raising his hands, etc. If connected to a set of mechanisms, it would show even more realism.

Performance Everywhere

After graduating from university, Edgar took Charlie and traveled around for eleven years, performing everywhere. At that time, performing troupes were very popular, and Edgar's tricks were welcomed everywhere. However, soon the performing troupes had bad luck and declined. He then felt the need to find another way out. His first thought was to dress up Charlie, putting a top hat on him and dressing him in a formal suit, making him look like a gentleman from high society. He took this treasure to the most fashionable nightclubs in America to perform.

Stepping onto the Silver Screen

Performing in nightclubs truly captivated many famous people from high society. So Edgar rose rapidly, and his reputation grew day by day. Various radio stations scrambled to recruit him. Later, the great producer Samuel Goldwyn invited them to star in "The Goldwyn Follies," with a price of twelve thousand US dollars per week.

Future Hopes

However, Edgar is not satisfied with his achievements. He is continuing to experiment with manufacturing wooden men with different personalities. In his new work "Detective Dummy," a new wooden man will appear, named Mortimer. He is a rural youth from the West. Simplicity, sincerity, and genuineness are his characteristics. This is completely different from Charlie's cunning style. In addition, he has completed a three-foot-long orangutan. Its movements are even more flexible. According to Edgar, "We hope to be able to manufacture wooden men who can laugh, make faces, and make all kinds of natural movements in the future!"

### Zhang Juhong Stars in Yi Hua's New Film "Qin Xianglian"

### Reuters on the Silver Screen

Reuters has become the world's largest news agency, with a lasting history of one hundred and fifty years. The founder was Julius Reuter, and its birthplace was in Aachen, Germany, near the Belgian border.

Recently, Hollywood's Warner Bros. has decided to introduce the company to the silver screen, with the big star Edward G. Robinson playing the lead role. Two days after the film began shooting, a telegram was sent directly from Reuters to Warner Bros., stating, "The departure point for the German invasion and occupation of the European Low Countries is in the company's birthplace." This point was unexpected by Warner Bros. beforehand. Otherwise, it is rumored that the film's content will be slightly changed.

### Chen Juanjuan Stars in "Du Shiniang"; "Snow White" Postponed

‚Äî Xinggu

Child star Chen Juanjuan, after returning to Shanghai from the interior not long ago, rejoined Xinhua Company at the invitation of Zhang Shankun to make films. On the one hand, to make up for the three years of missed studies, she is also studying at a small school on Lafayette Road.

Originally, Xinhua had prepared to film "Chinese Snow White" as the first film for Juanjuan's return to Xinhua, with Juanjuan starring alone. However, recently, "Guolian" stopped all ongoing films to rush-produce ten folk tales, so the preparations for "Chinese Snow White" were also delayed accordingly.

Furthermore, because Guolian is rushing to shoot ten folk tales, there is a shortage of actors. Because of this, Chen Juanjuan has also been assigned a role in one of the ten folk tales, which is "Du Shiniang." Juanjuan plays the role of Du Shiniang's maid "Si'er" in the film. Chen Yanyan plays Du Shiniang, the male lead is Liu Qiong, and Yan Yuexian's younger sister Yan Yueling also plays an important role in "Du Shiniang."

This is Juanjuan's first time acting in an ancient costume folk tale. "Du Shiniang" can be said to be Juanjuan's debut in ancient costume films. However, according to Juanjuan, she does not particularly like acting in ancient costume films because she says she looks ugly in ancient costumes and loses her original innocent and lively expression and demeanor.

From the first of this month, she filmed five consecutive nights at the Lilac Garden, which was really tiring. So when reporters met her yesterday, her face seemed a little thinner, and she was clearly very tired. Juanjuan is busy for art, which we should praise.

As for "Chinese Snow White," Juanjuan said that it will only be able to start filming after "Du Shiniang" is completed.

### Ning Xuan Wishes to Leave the Film Industry

‚Äî Kui

Ning Xuan, known as a "two-talent film star," recently completed key roles in Yi Hua's "Taiping Heavenly Kingdom" and "Guanyin." Ning Xuan used to be very enthusiastic about the film industry, but now, if someone asks her about her interest in making movies, she always answers indifferently, "There's really nothing to do making movies."

Because she is very disappointed in making films, she has recently become very interested in Peking Opera. Recently, when she is relatively free from filming with Yi, she has hired Wang Yifang and Jin Biqi to specialize in Peking Opera at home. Wang Yifang teaches her swordsmanship, and Jin Biqi explains the plays to her. The mornings are scheduled for learning swordsmanship, and the afternoons are for explaining plays and practicing vocals.

Seeing Ning Xuan's weariness with the screen life and her fondness for Peking Opera, she has told people that once her contract with Yi Hua expires, she may leave the film industry and go to Peking to study further. It seems that Ning Xuan's future may be to go from an amateur to a professional, officially becoming active on the red stage.

### Black Heaven

‚Äî Screening Soon

Wu Cun directed and Zhou Xuan starred in Guotai Company's first fashion satire film "Black Heaven," which has been completed for a long time. Because the film is the first work of Guohua Brothers Company Guotai, the topic, actors, scenery, costumes, and capital spent are all top-notch. The public has been urging its screening for a long time, so it has now been scheduled to be solemnly screened at Jincheng next term.
