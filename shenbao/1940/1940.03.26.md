### Hua Army Engages in Bloody Battle in Suiyuan West, Recovering Both Wuyuan Cities Completely; Xishan Zui, a Key Point on the Baotou-Wuyuan Highway, Also Captured; Hua Forces Continue to Scour the Remaining Enemy Forces Before Ula Mountain

Lanzhou, 21st – The Hua army, having entered both the new and old cities of Wuyuan, has been engaging in fierce street battles with the Japanese army in recent days.

At approximately 6:00 PM on the same day, apart from a small number of remaining Japanese soldiers who broke through and fled to the outskirts, where they were cut off and continued to fight fiercely, all the remaining Japanese soldiers within the city were annihilated. Consequently, both the new and old cities of Wuyuan were completely recovered. The Hua civilians, who had been under occupation for nearly two months, were overjoyed to see the Blue Sky with a White Sun flag flying once again. It is estimated that over 3,300 Japanese soldiers were killed in this battle, and a large amount of military supplies were seized, including 27 mountain guns and flat-trajectory guns, light and heavy machine guns, automobiles, and radio stations.

The first major victory was the victory achieved in Binyang last month. According to the Hua side, the Japanese army's losses in Lingshan this time are estimated at 4,500 men. The amount of military equipment captured by the Hua army is beyond calculation. (25th United Press Dispatch)

The Circumstances of the Recapture of Lingshan

Liuzhou – This time, the Japanese in Southern Guangxi gathered the remaining forces from the Yong-Qin line and launched a large-scale eastward offensive. The brave Hua army, according to a pre-determined plan, divided its forces to inflict heavy losses on the enemy, resulting in a great victory. The process is as follows: Starting on the 13th of this month, the Japanese army along the Yong-Qin Road gathered over 10,000 Japanese soldiers, and under the cover of machine guns and artillery, began to stir in two routes. One route of four to five thousand attacked Pingji Xu from Jiulong Xu. After a fierce interception by the Hua army, there were many casualties. The Japanese repeatedly reinforced and launched fierce attacks, breaking into Kongping Xu. They were again ambushed by the Hua army, and at the same time, their rear route was intercepted. With no way to escape, they fled east to Luwu Xu. The other route of seven to eight thousand attacked east from Tingzi Xu via Pumiao. At Liu Xu, they were fiercely attacked by the Hua army and suffered heavy losses. They then divided into two routes to harass the area. One route attempted to attack Yongchun. After being blocked by the Hua army near Nanxiang Township, they harassed Feilong Xu to the south, rushing to Jiangkou, Nanxiang Jin, and heading towards Pingnan. Wherever the flames of war reached, houses were reduced to ruins. The Japanese army, which attacked south from Liu Xu, suffered heavy casualties at the hands of the Hua army near Taiping Xu. The Japanese repeatedly charged fiercely, advancing close to Jiuzhou, and then joined forces with the Luwu Japanese to attack Nalong. In order to drive the Japanese to advantageous locations for annihilation, the main force turned and advanced behind the Japanese. By the evening of the 17th, the Japanese army had broken into Lingshan. On the 18th, they came to reconnoiter Fuzi Xu. By the evening of the 19th, the encirclement was complete. The Hua army's various routes of the main force advanced fiercely, launching a large-scale annihilation battle in the northeast region of Lingshan. First, they annihilated over half of the Japanese forces that had broken into the vicinity of Nanxiang, and then defeated the Japanese forces near Fuzi Xu. The Japanese army was thrown into great chaos. By the morning of the 21st, the Japanese army collapsed completely and broke out in a disorderly retreat, trampling each other along the way. They abandoned a large amount of weapons, ammunition, and baggage. The Hua army followed closely and pursued them. On the 22nd, they recovered Lingshan. The majority of the Japanese fled westward, and a portion fled south. The Hua army is currently closely pursuing them in separate routes. In total, this battle resulted in the death of over 6,500 Japanese soldiers and countless war supplies were seized, creating the second great annihilation battle in Southern Guangxi, which is sufficient to make the Japanese warlords collapse as soon as possible.

Editorial

### Japan's International Situation

Today's Japan knows that it cannot win the war against China and that defeat is imminent, so it wants to change its tactics and create political struggles in the hope of achieving a lucky victory. On the Chinese side, although it believes that this new tactic of Japan's "cannot be emphasized, nor can it be ignored," it does not consider this to be the struggle, nor does it consider Japan's political tactics to be a substitute for military struggles, so it is determined to continue the war of resistance. China knows that it has built a solid foundation of cooperation between the military and the people through its long-term war of resistance and has opened up a bright path. China is using its own strength to create, determine its own destiny, rule, and manage everything itself; it is by no means something that others can participate in or handle on its behalf. When Japan launched its military aggression, it wanted to swallow the entire China; now that it has switched to political tactics, it forcibly implements them and wants to block China's five thousand miles of coastline, guard its three thousand miles of north-south defense line, close the entire Chinese door, capture four hundred and eighty million people and use them as tools, and completely exclude the interests of third countries from Chinese territory. Therefore, Japan only hopes to create a political struggle and win, and then engage in a diplomatic struggle with the United Kingdom, the United States, France, the Soviet Union, and other countries related to the Far East, so that it can complete its grand ambition of swallowing China. Who knows that the separation of friends and enemies is by no means at its discretion.

Of course, the interests of various countries are not exactly the same as those of China, and their attitudes towards Japan differ at least in degree. Of course, the countries did not initially have any preconceived notions, but after witnessing Japan's military invasion over the past two years and witnessing China's determination and strength to resist the war and build the country, they now understand that the peace of the world, whether it is a matter of their individual interests in the Far East, is inextricably linked to China's independence and autonomy. China's direct aggression is the indirect infringement of other countries' interests in China. Small things must be said, let's prove it with recent examples: the incident of the Japanese army invading southern Guangxi and bombing the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway on a large scale immediately followed; in addition to the Chinese, there were also several French women and children who were killed and injured in the bombing; even if we do not consider this as Japan's direct provocation to France, it at least shows that for Japan, China and France have the same interests. The British warship searched the German people on the Japanese mail ship, and Japan took this opportunity to intensify its anti-British actions; what can be seen in its actual actions is not in Japan, but in the tighter blockade of the Tianjin Concession, prohibiting the carrying of food, hindering business, and oppressing priests. This is a provocation to the United Kingdom and also shows that for Japan, China and the United Kingdom have the same interests. The Japanese offensive against the United Kingdom and France was originally not in one aspect or one way, and it is inevitable that it will use its political tactics to make further demands in the future. For example, recently, Major General Muto, Director of the Military Affairs Bureau of the Japanese Army Ministry, told the Japanese parliament: Japan is preparing to take appropriate steps to deal with the refusal of third countries to return their concessions in China to those in power. Japan is prepared to abandon concession rights to the new Nanjing regime and expects third countries to take similar action. This is certainly not to say that Japan can really be generous, nor is it to say that the countries are deceived, but it is just a kind of coercion and an excuse. Here it is also enough to prove that Japan's political offensive is not aimed at China alone, but under Japan's political tactics towards China, all countries and China share the same interests. It only hopes that all countries will accept the false sound of intimidation, and all countries will be timid and "stop interfering in Japan's military operations and assist the National Government of China." Then its broken dream of military aggression victory will be revived and its good dream will be fulfilled again.

All countries can understand that China is closely related to all countries; the root cause of China's "multi-assistance" and Japan's "few assistance" lies in this. The difference between more help and less help not only directly affects the Sino-Japanese war situation, but also determines that Japan's imagined diplomatic struggle will eventually fail completely. And now its failure has already begun. Looking at it, after the expiration of the US-Japan business, Japan knows that it has no hope of concluding a new one, so it has no choice but to prepare a large amount of cash to purchase a large amount of necessities from the United States, order a large amount of gasoline from Mexico, and contact Argentina for barter trade. It no longer asks the Netherlands to obtain the South Seas market and willingly agrees to sell Dutch goods. These are all Japan's last resorts and are accelerating its economic suicide policy. It thought that bombing the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway would coerce France, but it did not expect that the French-Japanese business would therefore be difficult to renew; it thought that threats and inducements would be enough to shake the United States, but it did not expect the United States to express strict love and hatred with a loan of 20 million US dollars to China; it thought that the Soviet Union could be used as a diplomatic tool to counter the United States, but it did not expect the various negotiations between the Soviet Union and Japan to announce that they had achieved nothing and all had fallen into ruin.

From the overall international situation, not only China firmly believes that Japan's political offensive can never replace the Sino-Japanese military struggle, but the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun also understands that the promotion of this method "is not just the success of peace" and is not enough for Japan to try its diplomatic struggle internationally. In short, Japan's internal consumption of material resources, financial exhaustion, external casualties of soldiers, and the reversal of the international situation, and its hoped-for rapid end to the China Incident will never give it the slightest chance of luck due to the objective environment and China's determination to resist the war, and its various actions and attempts are only extremely "self-defeating."

### Abe to Visit China Next Month With a Broad Scope of Tasks; Japan's Decision on Recognizing the Puppet Regime to Be Made After Abe's Inspection

Tokyo – Prime Minister Yonai hosted a banquet last night for Abe, the new envoy to China's new "Central Government" and former Prime Minister, with Konoe, Hiranuma, and Hayashi Senjuro in attendance. During the banquet, discussions were held on the China issue, as well as internal and external issues. Abe plans to depart for China in early April. (25th United Press Dispatch)

Tokyo – Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma stated this morning while meeting with reporters that Abe, the former Prime Minister of the House of Representatives, may not arrive in Nanjing at the end of the month to attend the establishment ceremony of the "New Central Government." Japan will not send a representative to participate in the ceremony, but a local person will represent the Japanese government. Abe may arrive in Nanjing a week after the ceremony. Prime Minister Yonai has formally invited Abe to assume the post of special envoy to the "New Central Government." Abe is expected to accept. It was previously expected that he would depart for China on the 20th of this month. (25th Reuters Dispatch)

Tokyo – The Japanese government has appointed former Prime Minister General Abe as a special envoy, preparing to go to Nanjing when the new government is established. Although all newspapers unanimously believe that this matter is important, there has been no explanation regarding the exact nature of Abe's mission and the length of his stay in China. According to some sources, Abe's most important task is to congratulate the "Nanjing New Government." As Abe served as Prime Minister during a time of great importance, his visit on behalf of the Japanese people can express the continued progress of the "Konoe Policy" and the "New Order in East Asia." On the other hand, it is said that in addition to congratulating, Abe will also conduct negotiations with the new government. A certain newspaper believes that "Abe's mission, in a word, is to negotiate with the leaders of the "New Government" to discuss the basic policy of establishing friendly relations between China and Japan." Therefore, his mission is extremely important. As for Japan's official recognition of the "New Government," it will not be realized until normal relations between the two countries are established. For this reason, Abe's visit is nothing more than a non-official recognition of the "New Government" in order to enhance its international standing. The semi-official "Japan Times" also said that Abe must be carrying a special mission, but the government has not yet explained what kind of mission it is. In addition, Abe himself met with reporters and gave a speech, saying, "I have been ordered to go to Nanjing, and I do not know when I will be able to return. The "Central Political Conference" held in Nanjing, which is used to decide the official establishment of the "New Government," is purely a matter of China's internal affairs, and there is no Japanese representative participating in it. Regarding the issue of Japan's recognition of the "New Government," I will not be able to express my opinion until I fully understand the intentions of the "New Government." I have expressed to Prime Minister Yonai that I hope to conduct a thorough study of the authority and mission of the "special envoy" and its relationship with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Asia Development Board." (23rd Havas Dispatch)

### Japan Plans to Return Concessions to Puppet Government and Will Force Third Countries to Take Similar Action

Tokyo – Major General Muto, Director of the Military Affairs Bureau of the Japanese Army Ministry, told the Japanese parliament that Japan is preparing to take "appropriate steps" to deal with the refusal of the first country to return its concessions in China to "those in power." Japan is prepared to abandon concession rights to the "New Nanjing Regime" and expects third countries to take similar action. Muto refused to indicate what steps Japan would take to deal with third countries that were determined to retain their treaty rights. He said, "This is not something that can be mentioned at this time. We can only say that we will take appropriate steps at the appropriate time." Muto also announced that an agreement had been reached between the United Kingdom and Japan last summer regarding the United Kingdom's recognition of the state of war in North China. Due to differing interpretations, disputes have arisen between the two countries recently. According to the Japanese interpretation, the United Kingdom must stop interfering in Japan's military operations and stop assisting the National Government. Both sides have now reopened negotiations on this agreement in an attempt to obtain a clearer definition. When asked by a member of parliament whether the United Kingdom had not fulfilled the terms of the agreement, Muto replied that this matter must be determined by each person's view of the agreement.

### Puppet Manchukuo Controls Import Trade, Establishing Two Agencies to Handle It

Tokyo - The Japan Times reports that Manchukuo has always adopted a laissez-faire approach to the commercial market. However, starting from May 1st of this year, all import trade, retail, and wholesale businesses will be subject to strict control by the authorities or semi-official organizations, similar to the current production control situation. Due to the frequent shortages of Japanese goods in Manchukuo, two agencies will be established to handle import goods and daily necessities separately. One is the "Manchukuo Daily Necessities Supply Corporation," a large-scale semi-official organization that will absorb all existing businesses. It will be responsible for controlling the import and distribution of "Category A goods," including sugar, tea, flour, salted fish, clothing and fabrics, rubber shoes, and sports equipment. These goods have traditionally been handled by ordinary import merchants. The corporation will also supply goods to northern Manchukuo, remote areas, and special organizations like the South Manchuria Railway Company and government employee consumer cooperatives. The other is the "Manchukuo Daily Necessities Importers Association," formed by prominent importers in major cities, managing "Category B goods," including soap, canned food, seafood, dairy products, silk fabrics, foreign groceries, porcelain, and enamelware. This association will supply these goods to major cities. In addition, the authorities plan to organize "Wholesalers Associations" and "Retailers Associations." However, this move is expected to fundamentally affect the economic organization of Manchukuo, causing great anxiety among business people. Although the authorities allow existing importers to cooperate with the Daily Necessities Supply Corporation to maintain business, most merchants believe this new plan only aims to absorb a few major importers and cannot be universally applied to everyone. The selection criteria for joining the Daily Necessities Supply Corporation require considering experience, credit, financial strength, and relationships with Japanese manufacturers. Most merchants consider this approach unfair. (Havas dispatch, 25th)

### Jiang Zhong Elaborates on the American Attitude

Chongqing - According to Professor Jiang Zhongfu, an expert on international issues at National Central University, in an article on American foreign policy published in the Central Daily News today, the current American policy is clearly to encourage China to continue fighting to exhaust Japan. At the same time, the United States is using all its capabilities to expand its navy and strengthen its defenses in the Pacific to prepare for dealing with Japan. On the other hand, the United States firmly adheres to the open-door policy to increase Japan's difficulties. Therefore, the American policy is very clear: it adopts a firm stance against Japan's illegal actions but continues to provide financial assistance to China. As for the embargo issue, the U.S. Congress has temporarily shelved the discussion, but this does not mean that the United States lacks the determination to oppose Japanese aggression. It shows that it is proceeding with extreme caution. (United Press dispatch, 25th)

### National Government Issues a Decree Praising Huang Mingtang

Chongqing - The National Government issued an order on the 25th, posthumously praising the late Lieutenant General Huang Mingtang of the Army. He followed the Premier from the past, adhered to the principles, repeatedly raised the banner of justice, and did not avoid hardship. He made outstanding contributions in the battles of Zhennanguan and Yin Kou. After the restoration, he remained loyal to the Party and the country, and his original aspirations remained unchanged. Upon hearing of his death from illness due to worrying about the country, the government deeply mourns his loss. He should be posthumously honored with a decree, and the Military Commission should deliberate on providing a pension according to the precedent for lieutenant generals. His life story should be preserved and announced to the historical archives to highlight his past achievements. This is the order. (Dispatch, 25th)

### Shanghai Jointly Formulates Agricultural Loan Guidelines

Chongqing - The General Office of the Four Banks Joint Management has formulated the outline of the national agricultural loan measures for the year, which has been reported in previous news. It is now known that the office has further concretized the above outline and formulated a draft agreement for the banks to jointly handle agricultural loans with the provincial governments and a draft of fifteen temporary agricultural loan guidelines to promote the work and ensure that the agricultural loan conditions in various provincial regions are consistent. In addition to detailed regulations based on the principles of agricultural loan operations in the outline, Article 11 further specifies four types of adjustment methods for agricultural loan work between the banks and local financial institutions in the provinces (such as provincial banks, farmers' banks, local banks, and provincial or county cooperative treasuries). The outline's fourth article lists the uses, loan amounts, terms, targets, loans, guarantees, and interest rates for the eight types of loans, which are specified in detail. It is said that the loan terms will include short-term one- or two-year loans, as well as five- and ten-year installment repayment plans.

### The Food Problem in Peiping Shows Slight Relaxation

Peiping - The high prices of flour and other foods in Peiping are mostly due to the exactions of taxes and levies when flour is transported from Tianjin to Peiping. A Reuters reporter investigated the reason why flour is sold for fifteen yuan per bag in Tianjin but more than twenty-two yuan in Peiping, and discovered that flour is levied at least three times during its transport from Tianjin to Peiping. According to Chinese flour merchants in the city, flour must first be allowed to be transported out of Tianjin, and it is said that obtaining a permit requires monetary rewards. When flour is transported out of the Tianjin Concession, it is taxed at the exit and entrance. Finally, the Chinese must pay before being allowed to sell the flour in Peiping. Foreigners in Peiping rarely doubt the levies on food at the exit and entrance of the Tianjin Concession. British Foreign Secretary Butler mentioned this matter in the House of Commons, and the collection of taxes is a well-known fact. Another factor in the high price of flour is the shortage of transportation vehicles and the Japanese monopoly on flour coming to Peiping. Only a few powerful grain stores have the right to distribute flour and other foods, and most of these grain stores are run by the Japanese. A grain merchant told the reporter that Chinese grain stores have no flour left, and only Japanese merchants are selling flour now. Chinese selling food must report the quantity of food sold to the police every day. There is now a large quantity of flour stored in the Tianjin Concession. If the Tianjin Social Bureau and the local Japanese military authorities are willing to allow the batch of flour to be moved out, it can be transported to Peiping in large quantities to alleviate the food shortage. If Peiping can no longer obtain flour, the people will rely on coarse grains such as soybeans and sorghum for survival. According to statistics here, Peiping City now has a supply of 280,000 tons of coarse grains, consuming about 10,000 tons per day. Therefore, the people of the city cannot sustain themselves on the existing food supply for long. The food situation in Peiping is now showing signs of slight relaxation because more flour has been transported in. Flour can now be purchased for around eighteen yuan per bag, whereas in the past few weeks, each bag was sold for twenty-two to twenty-four yuan. Two batches of rice are expected to arrive here within days. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)

### U.S. Churches Advocate Expanding the Scope of Embargo Against Japan, Passing a Resolution at the Annual Meeting in Philadelphia: Christians Should Automatically Boycott Japanese Goods

Philadelphia, U.S.A. - Representatives from twenty-three American churches recently held an annual meeting here and immediately passed a resolution advocating the settlement of the Far East issue in accordance with a "constructive force plan." At the same time, they advocated expanding the scope of embargoed goods against Japan. The text stated: "If China wants to avoid aggression from Japan, the Soviet Union, and Western imperialist countries, it must be truly independent and self-reliant, able to handle its own affairs and control its own destiny. The United States must recognize this policy and not shift its attention, abandon the fundamental for the superficial, just because its interests in China have suffered damage and it wants to obtain compensation or its pure trade rights want to be restored. In order to implement this policy, we should expand the scope of embargoed goods against Japan and include trucks, scrap copper, scrap money, crude oil, and other raw materials for military supplies. However, in order to show Japan that it is willing to maintain friendly relations, the government should also conclude a new commercial agreement with that country based on an "average import quota system" so as to restore the quantity of American goods exported to that country to the average number between 1921 and 1931. In short, the United States must also recognize Japan's pressing economic problems and needs and satisfy them in an appropriate manner." In addition, there is another proposal advocating that American Christians should automatically boycott Japanese goods, which is to be submitted for discussion. (Havas)

Hong Kong - Tokyo External News: The Japanese political world is uneasy about the U.S. attitude. At a subcommittee meeting in the House of Representatives yesterday, Kono, a member of the Seiyukai orthodox faction, stated that the U.S. Far East policy and Japan's policy of handling the "China Incident" are difficult to reconcile, and specifically requested the government to clarify the relationship between Washington and the Chongqing National Government. The U.S. is expanding its navy and has abolished the U.S.-Japan commercial agreement. There is a serious crisis hidden in the future of U.S.-Japan relations. However, why hasn't the government made the people pay attention to this? Another member criticized the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for failing in its diplomacy with the U.S. and said that the future is worrying. He asked whether the Foreign Minister had any hope of success in negotiations with the Soviet Union and suggested that the government buy Soviet territory in the Far East to avoid friction between the two countries. Foreign Minister Arita replied that U.S.-Japan relations are indeed unsatisfactory. The U.S. has sympathy and understanding for China's relations and its traditional methods, but Japan's military operations have now been reduced in scope, and efforts will be made to improve relations between the two countries in the future. Prime Minister Yonai said that the government is determined to make twice the effort to seek U.S. understanding. Regarding the U.S. expansion of its navy, the government must consider the worst-case scenario, so the Japanese navy must be fully prepared. Navy Minister Yoshida said that the Japanese navy is very concerned about the U.S. expansion of its navy, but does not feel insecure as a result. The navy of the Japanese Empire is determined to prepare everything to cope with any eventuality. (Dispatch, 24th)

### Japan Further Increases the People's Burden by Reforming the Tax System Amendment: The House of Peers Has Passed It

Hong Kong - Tokyo News: The House of Peers passed the House of Representatives amendment to the tax system reform this morning. In the future, the government can increase tax revenue by 500 million yen per year. (Dispatch, 25th)

Hong Kong - Tokyo News: The House of Peers has also passed the tax system reform bill. Minister of Finance Sakurai issued the following statement today: "The purpose of the tax system reform plan has four items, namely: (1) to equalize the tax burden; (2) to make the tax system coordinate with the national economy; (3) to increase tax revenue; and (4) to make the tax system more flexible than before. The scope of this reform plan is unprecedented. Now that the House of Peers and the House of Representatives have successively passed the reform bills, it is extremely gratifying. However, after the tax system reform, the people's burden will be heavier than before. At a time when prices are rising, the government is increasing the people's burden. From the government's point of view, it feels uneasy. However, in order to achieve the goal of the 'China Incident,' the implementation of the reform plan is unavoidable. I hope the people can understand the government's difficulties and cooperate in implementing the new tax system." (Dispatch, 25th)

### Six Members of the Kuhara Faction of the Japanese Seiyukai Party Resign from the Party

Hong Kong - Tokyo News: Six members of the Kuhara faction of the Seiyukai Party declared their resignation from the party due to disagreements over the Saito incident. (Dispatch, 25th)

Hong Kong - Tokyo News: Two small parties, the Jikyoku Doshikai, etc., have recently requested that parliamentary members of various parties submit a no-confidence motion against the Foreign Minister to the House of Representatives regarding the Asama Maru incident. However, both the Seiyukai and the Minseito have expressed opposition, so the proposal of the two parties will often not be submitted to the House of Representatives. In addition, a motion of confidence in the speaker, which was previously proposed by several small political parties in the House of Representatives due to Saito's "slip of the tongue," was rejected by the party meetings today.

### Japanese Workers' Lives are Difficult, and Labor-Management Disputes Arise One After Another

Tokyo - Due to soaring prices and rising living standards, workers' lives are becoming increasingly difficult. The military organ "Kokumin Shimbun" recently published an article urging the government to pay attention to this and advocating that wages should be raised in proportion to the increase in living standards. The first step is to formulate a minimum wage, following the precedents of certain European and American countries. The article stated: "After the government issued an order to fix wages and prices on September 18 of last year, wages failed to increase, but prices continued to rise, causing workers across the country to face extremely difficult circumstances and their lives to become increasingly difficult. Labor-management disputes have been frequently seen this year, and the government authorities must pay attention to this. At this time, labor-management disputes have not reached a serious stage, but if the government does not remedy the wage problem in time, serious consequences will inevitably occur."

### Japan Plans to Levy Special Tax on Foreign Goods Transported to Hankou, Japanese Consulate in Hong Kong Still Denies It

Hong Kong - It is rumored that the Japanese authorities here plan to levy a special tax of 20% ad valorem on foreign goods other than Japanese goods transported into Hankou, which has greatly alarmed the business community in Hankou. It is said that several shipping companies have received notices from the Japanese side regarding this matter. However, a representative of the Japanese Consulate General denied the plan, saying that the Japanese authorities have no intention of levying tax rates on imported foreign goods. (Reuters, 25th)

### Japan's Development of the Northeast Faces Difficulties: Members Advocate that Various Prefectures Advance Southward

Tokyo - At a meeting of the Budget Committee of the House of Representatives yesterday, Fukuda, a member of the Minseito Party, raised an inquiry, saying that the authorities of the Ministry of Colonial Affairs had actively developed Manchuria and immigrated large numbers of people there, focusing on the northern regions. However, Manchuria's climate is not suitable for the lives of the Japanese, so development work is quite difficult. In the South Seas, the islands are rich in products and have a relaxed life, and there are more development opportunities. For the government's sake, it should focus on this aspect. Minister of Colonial Affairs Koiso Kuniaki immediately replied that advancing south and advancing north are both goals for Japan's external development. Therefore, the government should encourage the economic development of the Hokuriku region on the one hand, and develop the natural resources of the South Seas on the other hand, and then gradually transplant people.

### Easter Sunday: The Pope and the Archbishop of Canterbury Preach About the World's War Calamities, Providing Christian Virtues

Vatican City - Pope Pius XII yesterday gave a sermon in Latin at Mass in St. Peter's Basilica, solemnly describing the suffering currently afflicting the world and stating that it is a state of war. He exhorted the world to follow the Christian virtues shown by Jesus, as this is the only panacea to remedy the moral, social, and economic disorders currently encountered by the people of various countries, and hoped that one day, with the help of the True God, evil forces would be eradicated and mankind would return to unity. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)

London - The Archbishop of Canterbury in England preached at the cathedral on Easter Sunday, saying that in the past 1,700 years, evil forces have never been as active and rampant as they are today. This kind of scene is truly the suffering of mankind on the cross. We do not believe that the True God wants the barbarous forces to continue to run rampant. We firmly believe that the United Kingdom and its allied countries will do their best, regardless of the cost, to eliminate this evil force. This must be in accordance with the will of the True God. Once the evil forces possessed by the current rulers of Germany have been overthrown and the land trampled by the German rulers has been restored, we must establish a brand new and better order of life on the already cleared base.

### All-India Muslim League Conference Concludes, Authorizing the Working Committee to Formulate a Constitution Plan

Johore - When the All-India Muslim League Conference concluded, the scene was very enthusiastic. The president of the League declared that the conference had proved to be an epoch-making event in Indian history, as it had determined the goal and would strive to achieve it. Before the closing ceremony, the conference unanimously passed a resolution, namely, the one passed by the People's Committee of the previous League. The resolution restated that the federal system announced by the previous Government of India Act was completely unsuitable for India and could not be implemented. Muslims cannot accept any constitution unless it is based on the principle of merging the provinces with a Muslim majority into independent states and providing entrusted protection for minorities. The resolution also authorized the Working Committee to formulate a constitutional plan in accordance with this principle and stipulated that the proposed regions should have full power over defense, diplomacy, transportation, and customs.

### Turkish Newspaper Comments on German-Romanian Relations

Turkish Capital - After Germany made certain new demands on Romania, people here generally expressed indignation. Congressman Lutfi Akkad commented on this in an article published in the "Ulus Newspaper," stating that although the demands made by Germany are not of the nature of an ultimatum, General Göring, the head of the country's air force, once gave a speech before the war, and its key point was: "If any country does not supply us with what our army needs, then our army will only drive straight in and take it." From this, we know that Germany has been ambitious for more than a day. At this point, the country is cut off from overseas due to the blockade implemented by Britain and France, so it has to turn to asking small countries to supply it with the items it needs. Even if the small countries suffer losses, they cannot refuse. At the same time, Germany also believes that it has the right to stop small countries from supplying goods to Britain and France, even if Britain and France pay in cash, they must not trade with them. This aggressive attitude is truly not something we can condone. In a nutshell, the only way for European countries to be safe is to stay away from Germany. Because if Germany wants to threaten them, Britain and France will directly intervene. (Havas dispatch, 24th)

### Turkish Foreign Minister Expresses Gratitude to Britain and France

London - Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu told a Daily Express correspondent stationed in the Turkish capital yesterday that Turkey is extremely satisfied with the assistance of Britain and France. "Although these countries are at war, their arms can still arrive in Turkey on schedule without any delays, which is commendable and valuable." In his view, the current war will not spread to the Middle East or the Balkan Peninsula.

(According to this point, the Turkish dignitaries also have the same views as Foreign Minister Saracoğlu.) "Turkey will not take any action to expand the scope of the current war." If the Soviet Union, Germany, and Italy decide to divide the Balkan Peninsula, no country in the Balkan Peninsula will make any concessions to the Soviet Union, Germany, or Italy, or to the three-country group. As a result, this corner of Europe will inevitably lead to official duties, and the scope of the war may not be limited. To maintain our security and protect our independence, we must fulfill the constraints on Britain and France and the allied countries in the Balkan Peninsula. (Havas dispatch, 25th)

### Third Anniversary of the Italian-Yugoslav Treaty

Rome - The foreign ministries of Italy and Yugoslavia exchanged telegrams yesterday to celebrate the third anniversary of the Italian-Yugoslav Treaty of Friendship on March 24, 1937. The telegram from Italian Foreign Minister Ciano briefly stated that the Treaty of Friendship concluded between Italy and Yugoslavia in the capital of Yugoslavia has opened a new period of friendly cooperation between the two countries, showing its great strength, and is in harmony with the interests of both countries. It is also the strong foundation of the current Italian-Yugoslav relations. Yugoslav Foreign Minister Marković replied that the Italian-Yugoslav Treaty of Friendship is a guarantee of peace in the Adriatic Sea region and a guarantee of friendly relations between Italy and Yugoslavia. The friendly relations between Italy and Yugoslavia have special importance in the current international situation. Italy and Yugoslavia will continue to maintain their policy of cooperation.

### The Luo Government Will Send an Economic Delegation to England, with Finance Minister Georgescu as the Head

Bucharest - The government here announced yesterday that it will send an economic delegation to London within the next few days. Romanian Finance Minister Georgescu will be the head of the delegation, which will include five other experts. Trade between Britain and Romania has significantly increased over the past year and a half compared to before. Romania has received considerable assistance from Britain in finance, leading to close ties between the two. A few years ago, Germany purchased large quantities of grain from Romania and resold them to Northern European countries to compensate for its financial shortages. At that time, Britain paid little attention to trade with Romania. Later, due to political reasons, Britain and Germany began a fierce competition for dominance. Germany is adjacent to Romania, while Britain holds financial advantages. Romania, on the other hand, strives to maintain a neutral stance in both politics and economics. (United Press, 25th)

Milan - The "Popolo d'Italia" newspaper published an article today discussing the disappointment of the Allied nations regarding Romanian oil. It stated that the Allies deeply hoped that after obtaining control of Romanian oil, they would be able to dominate Europe and gain an advantage over Germany. The Allies had assisted British and French capital in investing in the Romanian oil industry in many ways. Seventy percent of Romanian oil is already in the hands of Britain and France. It is believed that Romania should transport large quantities of oil to Britain and France in proportion to the investment received. In other words, Romania, under investment pressure, will become an ally of the Allied nations. The Allied nations did not consider that this move would provoke Germany or that Romania would be dragged into the war. Although Romanian officials sought clever solutions, the establishment of an oil committee to manage oil distribution caused great commotion in Britain and France. However, Romania has been threatened with the termination of certain raw materials and the denial of military assistance. Nevertheless, it will not be easy for Britain and France to regain control of Romanian oil. (Reuter, 25th)

### Construction in Western Belarus

Moscow - Ponomarenko, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Belarus, wrote today, "Large-scale construction work is currently underway in Western Belarus. Over 10,000 people are participating in the construction of the Dnieper-Bug Canal, and tens of thousands more are involved in restoring the Dnieper-Pinsk Canal. New factories are being built. The Brest textile factory will produce 10 million meters of fabric this year, and the timber industry will produce 4 million cubic meters of wood. At the same time, a chemical industry has been established, and a paper mill is also under construction. Impoverished farmers, who previously had nothing, have now acquired countless farmlands. The authorities have distributed 25,000 head of cattle and 10,000 horses to poor farmers. The authorities are also assisting farmers with experts, and agricultural tool repair shops have also been established. There are now four universities, eight normal schools, 4,000 ordinary schools, and seven theaters in Western Belarus. These are initial successes of socialist construction and glorious achievements of the Leninist-Stalinist national policy." (TASS, 24th)

### Molotov Will Not Go to Berlin

Stockholm - The Aftonbladet correspondent in Moscow recently detailed the news that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov would not go to Berlin, stating that Germany cannot rely on the Soviet Union as a dependable ally who will consistently provide assistance during the war. The German side believes that if Foreign Minister Ribbentrop were to go to Moscow a third time, it would be detrimental to Germany's prestige. Therefore, Germany had tried to persuade Molotov to visit Germany or Poland, but this was rejected by the Soviet Union. The Soviet government believes that Germany needs the Soviet Union, but the Soviet Union does not need Germany. It is considered more appropriate for Ribbentrop not to go to Moscow. (Reuters, 25th)

### Greek National Day

Athens - Today, Greece celebrates its Independence Day. Newspapers emphasize that this commemoration is of particular significance in the current situation. They state that Greece has the strength to safeguard its independence and territorial integrity and is willing to enjoy a peaceful life within the framework of the Balkan Entente. The King, along with the Crown Prince and the Prime Minister, reviewed troops in Athens today. (Reuters, 25th)

### Soviet Izvestia on the Situation in Northern Europe

Moscow - Izvestia commented today on the issue of Soviet-Finnish economic cooperation, stating that the prospects for Soviet-Finnish economic cooperation are unlimited. Due to the blockade by belligerent countries, Finland is experiencing a severe shortage of certain raw materials, but the Soviet Union is now supplying Finland with these needed materials. At the same time, as a result of cooperation with the Soviet Union, Finland has great potential for developing its production and resources and can avoid being enslaved by another country. It is absurd that Finland has been importing salt from Egypt and other places. The construction of the Kantalaksha-Kemijärvi railway will help develop Finland's forests. The Soviet-Finnish agreement stipulates that the Soviet Union can transport goods through Petsamo to Norway. We believe that trade between the Soviet Union, Finland, and Norway is of great importance to Norway's economic life. The Soviet-Finnish peace will consolidate and promote economic cooperation between the Soviet Union and Norway and Sweden. This peace, like the entire peaceful policy of the Soviet Union, has given the peoples of Northern Europe and Northwest Europe a bright future. (TASS, 25th)

### Current Status of British Foreign Trade

Berlin - Newspapers here this morning all wrote articles discussing the British foreign trade statistics for January. It is reported that the British trade deficit in January increased from £42 million (in December of the previous year) to £60 million, an increase of 37%. Germany believes that there are three reasons for the sharp increase in British imports: (1) the devaluation of the pound sterling; (2) rising international commodity prices; and (3) due to German naval warfare, most of the cargo ships have been sunk, so more goods have to be imported to meet market needs. The average monthly trade deficit last year was £33.56 million. The trade deficit in January of this year was £60 million. If it continues to increase, the trade deficit in 1940 will be £720 million. In this case, Britain will need to produce at least £500 million to offset the imbalance in international trade. Therefore, based on the current state of British international trade, Germany can be quite optimistic. Engaging in economic warfare with Britain will definitely be unfavorable to the latter. Germany's optimism is based on the fact that since the outbreak of the war, its export trade has failed to maintain normal conditions. Although the prices of industrial products have increased, the export trade in January was only worth £41.08 million, compared to £40.17 million in December of last year. British export trade still depends on imported raw materials. Maritime dangers are sufficient to make it impossible for Britain to promote export trade. (Reuter, 25th)

### Danish Parliament Convenes Today

Denmark - The Danish Parliament is scheduled to convene a meeting at 4:00 PM tomorrow. The Social Democratic Party and the Farmers' Party have telegraphed their members to discuss various issues tonight. The agenda for tomorrow's parliament includes several economic proposals. It is rumored that there will also be important decisions regarding financial issues and North Sea shipping issues. Parliamentary sources say that Prime Minister Stauning may submit his resignation to the King, but this rumor has not been confirmed. It is said that Stauning is 66 years old and has previously expressed hope that young people would take charge of the country. Since the outbreak of the European war, all parties have considered forming a coalition government, which must be led and organized by a new prime minister. (Reuter, 25th)

### Reynaud Issues Statement, Emphasizes British Economic Cooperation, and States That a European Federation is Possible. He Met with the British and Italian Ambassadors Yesterday Morning.

Lisbon - French Prime Minister Reynaud recently stated to the Paris correspondent of the Lisbon Daily News, "The British-French alliance is truly the core of the future Europe. Its current economic cooperation methods are not only technically important, but also sufficient to reflect the common desire of the two nations to cooperate closely to rebuild post-war Europe. This is truly an unprecedented initiative in history." The correspondent then asked Prime Minister Reynaud whether a European Federation could become a reality. Prime Minister Reynaud replied, "Why not?" (Havas, 25th)

Paris - Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Reynaud received Italian Ambassador Guariglia and British Ambassador Corbin this morning, one after the other, and held talks. Reynaud is scheduled to deliver a radio address at 8:00 PM tomorrow, explaining the current foreign policy. (Havas, 25th)

London - The reorganization of the French cabinet is still a topic of discussion among newspapers and diplomatic circles here. It is said that the British House of Commons has granted Prime Minister Chamberlain "full power" to preside over the war effort and has also endorsed his policy towards Finland. This is not the case in the French Parliament, which expressed dissatisfaction with the same policy pursued by former Prime Minister Daladier. This difference may be small and insignificant, but it should not be a cause for concern, as the attitude of the British House of Commons towards Prime Minister Chamberlain will not be affected by it. In short, although the methods used by Britain and France in dealing with domestic problems may not be entirely the same, both nations are determined to fight to the final victory, which is beyond doubt. (Havas, 25th)

### Soviet Pravda Comments on Reynaud's Declaration, Predicts the Future of the French Cabinet

Moscow - Pravda today published an article commenting on the new French cabinet, entitled "The Failure of the Reynaud Government." The article stated, "The declaration of the French government shows that the Reynaud cabinet will continue the policies of the Daladier government. In other words, the domestic situation will inevitably worsen, and acts of terror and violence will continue to emerge. The declaration of the French government clearly shows no intention of improving Franco-Soviet relations. On the contrary, the declaration has explicitly launched a direct attack on the Soviet Union. Furthermore, the declaration has not satisfied the parliament, so the internal contradictions of France have not been resolved. The international position of the French government is not bright, and its foreign policy is still controlled by Britain. The Soviet-Finnish peace has dealt a serious blow to Daladier's foreign policy, which was also a major reason for his resignation. The declaration of the Reynaud government shows that the French ruling class has not learned anything from the Soviet-Finnish peace. The voting of some members of parliament reflects the instability and chaos within the French petty bourgeoisie. The Reynaud government has failed from the very beginning, and there will be more failures in the future. Its prospects are truly bleak." (TASS)

Brussels - An aircraft of unclear nationality entered Belgian airspace over central Belgium this morning. Local anti-aircraft batteries fired at it, but it was not hit due to its high altitude. (Havas, 25th)

### German Ship Sunk by British Submarine in Danish Territorial Waters; Danish Neutrality Violated

Copenhagen - The German ship "Stinnes" was sunk by a British submarine near Thorsminde on the west coast of Denmark yesterday morning. The incident occurred only two nautical miles from the Danish coast. The submarine fired at the ship from the direction of the coast, so the British submarine must have violated Danish neutrality within the three-mile territorial waters. Currently, the wreckage of the German ship is still two nautical miles from the Danish coast. A Reuter correspondent learned from residents of Thorsminde that residents of the town heard an explosion at midnight and went to inspect the coast. They saw a British submarine submerged below the surface and two lifeboats carrying thirteen and seven German crew members, two of whom were injured. The British submarine had opened fire on crew members who had not yet boarded the lifeboats. (Reuter, 25th)

Paris - French naval figures emphasize the importance of British naval activity off the Scandinavian coast, saying that it is a systematic action intended to cut off Germany's supply of Swedish iron ore. (Reuters, 25th)

Oslo - The Naval Department issued a statement yesterday saying that on March 21, a German fishing boat in the Hustadvika area reportedly was threatened by a British destroyer in Norwegian territorial waters. On the same day, when a German freighter escorted by a Norwegian torpedo boat was passing through Hustadvika, a British destroyer signaled, asking for the name of the ship. The Norwegian torpedo boat immediately ordered the destroyer to leave Norwegian territorial waters. The Norwegian side has instructed its embassy in Britain to protest the incident. The statement concluded by saying that on March 22, a British destroyer attempted to intercept a German ship in Norwegian territorial waters near Ålesund. The matter is currently under investigation by the Norwegian authorities. (Reuters, 25th)

Oslo - The Norwegian government today instructed the Norwegian Embassy in Britain to protest to the British government because British warships had violated Norwegian territorial waters three times in one day. According to the Norwegian note, last Thursday, when a German fishing boat requested Norwegian protection, it was threatened by a British destroyer that had entered Norwegian territorial waters. Later that day, a British destroyer again entered Norwegian territorial waters and attempted to intercept a German ship being escorted by a Norwegian torpedo boat. At this time, the Norwegian torpedo boat ordered the British ship to leave. On Friday, a British destroyer fired warning shots at a Swedish ship off the coast of Ålesund. The Norwegian government is still investigating the matter. (Associated Press, 25th)

### Hitler to Deliver Important Speech

The Hague - It is rumored in Berlin that Hitler will deliver a major political speech within days. It is now believed that he will complete the final draft at Berchtesgaden. The understanding between the Axis powers and the Soviet Union is currently the main topic of discussion in Berlin. It is hoped that Hitler's speech will clarify this point. The speech is also intended to dispel the disappointment of the German people caused by the lack of diplomatic success in Hitler's recent meeting with Mussolini. (Reuters, 25th)

London - Recently, a new German torpedo was washed ashore on a beach four miles south of Bridlington Harbour in Britain. It was discovered by local people and immediately examined by experts from the Admiralty. According to the examination results, the torpedo was likely dropped by a German seaplane eight days ago. It is 12 feet long and engraved with a portrait of Prime Minister Chamberlain, holding an umbrella. According to the experts, this type of torpedo has two purposes: one is to directly attack ships of various countries, and if it fails to hit, it will drift on the surface of the sea and be used as a mine. This is the first time that such a new type of torpedo has been found in Britain. (Havas, 25th)

### German Labor Front Leader Speaks on the War Situation, Says People Are Becoming More United

Berlin - Dr. Robert Ley, leader of the German Labor Front, gave a speech here yesterday, stating that the German people are more united six months after the start of the war than before. The Germans are united in believing that victory is certain and imminent, but the British and French are increasingly fearful. At the beginning of the war, Britain and France hoped that Poland could resist for at least a year, and later hoped that Finland could fight for a long time. Britain cannot evade blame for the Soviet-Finnish war. Today, it is not Germany that is isolated, but Britain. I firmly believe that the final victory will belong to Germany. I deeply hope that the people of the country will be loyal and united, obey the leader, and have no other expectations. (Reuter, 25th)

### Eight Ships Built in Hong Kong Offered to British Government

Hong Kong - When the Hong Kong Legislative Council passed the first and second readings of the wartime tax bill, it unanimously approved a donation of £100,000 to the British government and a proposal to allocate HK$5 million to build ships for the British government in Hong Kong. The bill will raise approximately HK$6 million annually through salary tax, business tax, company tax, and property tax. Hong Kong shipyards have a long-standing reputation among overseas shipyards in the British Empire. Recently, they have built two 10,000-ton merchant ships. Now, with the first revenue from the new tax, they will build two minesweepers, four patrol vessels, and two ferries to be offered to the British Army and Navy. During the Legislative Council's debate on the bill, a Chinese councilor, Mr. Li, stated that if a nation claims to be superior to other nations and therefore has the exclusive right to live, civilization is in danger, and the world will have no peace.

### "Provisional Government to Dissolve" in Beijing

Beijing - It is reported that the North China Political Affairs Commission will be established in early April to replace the "Beijing Provisional Government" after the inauguration of the "New Central Government." It is expected that the "Provisional Government" will be dissolved on March 29. However, all political organs under the "Provisional Government," except for the Political Committee and the Judicial Committee, will continue to operate as usual, but with new names. The North China Political Affairs Commission will be formally established after Wang Kemin returns to Beijing from Nanjing. Beijing is currently preparing for the "celebration of the establishment of the New Central Government." The Greater East Asia Society, which is run by the Japanese, will launch a marathon long-distance race. (Reuters, 25th)

(Havas, 25th)

Chongqing - Reuters, after carefully reviewing the list of Central Executive and Supervisory Committee members of the Kuomintang, including alternate members, and the entire list of authorities of the party, discovered that only six out of a total of 260 Central Executive and Supervisory Committee members participated in the "Nanjing New Central Government." According to Kuomintang authorities, this figure is sufficient to prove how absurd it is for Wang Jingwei to claim that he can represent the true Kuomintang and how few followers he has today. The last plenary session of the Central Executive and Supervisory Committees compiled a list of 249 members, with 11 deceased, so the total number of Central Executive and Supervisory Committee members should be 238. At the last meeting of the two committees, there were 120 executive committee members and 50 alternate executive committee members, 50 supervisory committee members and 29 alternate supervisory committee members. Since then, five executive committee members have passed away, leaving 115, of whom three have joined Wang's government, namely Wang himself, Zhou Fohai, and Chen Gongbo. Two alternate executive committee members have passed away, leaving only 48, none of whom have joined the new government. Four supervisory committee members have passed away, leaving 46, of whom only Chen Gongbo and Chu Minyi belong to Wang's faction. One alternate supervisory committee member has passed away, leaving 28, of whom only the Manchu Pu Dong, who is famous for singing opera, is associated with Wang. There are two other committee members who, although they have not joined Wang, have been expelled from the party. One is Enke Batu, a supervisory committee member who has gone to "Manchukuo," and the other is He Shizhen, an alternate supervisory committee member who organized a new Kuomintang with Chen Gongbo, which has now been reorganized under the name of the New League. There are still some people who have joined Wang, but they insist that "they do not agree with Wang's policies." A high-ranking official of the Kuomintang claimed that when he met Chen Gongbo in Hong Kong, Chen said that he did not agree with Wang's policies, but his attachment was intended to delay the establishment of a puppet government under Japanese protection. If the puppet government is established, he will do his best to limit Wang's activities and maintain contact with Chongqing. (Reuters, 25th)

### Xikang as an Anti-Japanese Base: After Visiting the Xikang Cultural Relics Exhibition

Chongqing correspondence: After the War of Resistance entered a new stage, based on objective needs, the border regions that were generally not valued in the past have now shifted in status and become the base for economic construction in the rear. In particular, due to the important decisions of the Third National Political Council and the provision of the "Sichuan-Xikang Construction Plan," the Sichuan-Xikang border region has become more valued by the general public. This time, the China Society of Natural Sciences' scientific expedition returned from an investigation in Xikang, bringing back extremely valuable data and experiences. An exhibition was recently held at the Chongqing Youth Association auditorium. The situation in Xikang is summarized as follows. Xikang was originally a part of the border region. After the War of Resistance, due to its importance in resisting Japan and building the country, it was changed to a province in the early spring of the Republic of China's 28th year. It has a total area of approximately 515,000 square kilometers and a population of approximately 3.8 million people, with an average of only five or six people per square kilometer, making it one of the provinces with the lowest population density in China. It governs 42 counties and one administrative bureau, with the provincial capital located in Ba'an County.

On the other hand, Xikang can be simply divided into two parts: one is the Kang Prefecture (the nomadic area of Xikang proper) (which is the Ya Prefecture), including Ya'an, Tianquan, Lushan, Yingjing, Hanyuan, and Jintang Administrative Bureau, etc.); the other is the Ning Prefecture (including Xichang, Yanyuan, Yanbian, Huili, Mianning, Yuexi, Zhaojue, Ningnan, etc.). Among these three regions, the Kang Prefecture was originally a part of Tibet, with only a few Han people among the residents, the rest being Tibetans. They live a nomadic life, with no fixed abode, and their diet consists mainly of fruit flour and milk. The climate is extremely cold, with large snow mountains on both the north and south routes, over 3,000 meters above sea level. Thick leather clothing is used to protect against the cold morning and evening. The Ya Prefecture was originally the westernmost part of Sichuan Province, with mostly Han residents. The climate is similar to that of Chengdu, and the terrain is relatively high. As for the Ning Prefecture, the Yi people are more numerous than the Han people. The Yi people are divided into two types: one is the raw Yi (white bones - Yi name), who are the ruled, and the other is the cooked Yi (black bones - Yi name), who are the rulers. This area is important as a transportation hub, and the provincial government's orders can reach it directly, but in remote areas, its jurisdiction still belongs to the Yi people. The climate is very beautiful and mild, and it is known as Little Yunnan.

Xikang is a vast and rich virgin land, an important area for resisting Japan and building the nation. It needs hardworking pioneers to explore it.

The richness and resources of Xikang are worthy of attention.

The Kang Prefecture has a very high terrain, with rivers winding between the valleys, thus forming an area rich in placer gold, especially in the northern route, which has the largest output. There are many private mining companies, with an annual output of over 7,000 taels. In terms of resources, the production of medicinal materials is also abundant, with many varieties, ranking second in the country. Speaking of forests, their vastness and density, apart from Siberia, this place is the first. As for animal husbandry, it goes without saying that the residents of this area are mainly nomadic, so cattle and sheep are everywhere. Among them, the yak has long hair, is strong, and is used by the locals as a means of transportation. In addition, there is a breed of pianniu, which is a good breed in China and one of its specialties.

The most famous specialty of the Ya Prefecture is Tuo tea, which is a medium for maintaining political relations with Kang and Tibet. The sales areas include Yunnan, Sichuan, and overseas. The tea has a very strong flavor and is very popular among the general public in the border regions. Secondly, the iron mine in Rongjing County has a management office, and the forest in Tianquan County, although the forest land is not large, was listed as the most valuable according to the results of a survey by the Ministry of Industry and Agriculture.

As for the Ning Prefecture, it is not only limited to the fertile land, rich pastures, and dense forests on the ground, but also has unlimited iron mines and other mineral resources in the underground layer. Because its terrain is 1,800 meters to 9,000 meters above sea level, the temperature difference throughout the year is minimal. It is not too hot in summer and not too cold in winter, making it quite suitable for living. The agricultural products here are very abundant. The locals have a saying, "The harvest of one year's cultivation can provide food for three years." From this sentence, one can imagine the abundance. In summer, rice, wheat, sugarcane, potatoes, cotton, hemp, peanuts, tobacco, and sesame are produced. In winter, there are plants such as barley, naked barley, rapeseed, and peas. The rice production is 2 million dan per year. Due to inconvenient transportation, there was a phenomenon of cheap grain hurting farmers in the past. Wheat is a major food for local residents, with an annual output of 5 million dan. In addition to being used as food, the locals also use it for brewing wine and feeding livestock. Of course, if cultivation is improved, the yield of rice, wheat, and other agricultural products will increase several times. In other aspects, timber and tobacco are also quite abundant. Mineral products include iron, copper, nickel, silver, gold, zinc, non-metallic minerals include coal, rock salt, gypsum, alum, graphite, marble, sulfur, etc., which are all very abundant. For example, the iron ore reserve in Huili is 8,084,000 tons, and the salt in Yanyuan is 27,500,000 tons. When Zhao Erfeng was the governor of Sichuan during the late Qing Dynasty, he made great efforts to develop the industry of Xikang, and built as many as eleven factories. This great achievement cannot be buried. Although all of them were destroyed after the establishment of the Republic of China, in terms of industry today, there are light industry factories in Kangding, such as a wool mill, a leather factory, and a paper mill in Ya'an, and the sixth and seventh Kang-Tibet tea factories. It is said that the provincial government is eagerly seeking to restore the industries run by Zhao Erfeng in order to strengthen the foundation of economic construction.

In terms of mining, the official institutions are very developed. Many mines are being excavated with relatively new tools, such as the Gold Mining Bureau jointly run by the provincial government and the Resources Committee. In addition, there are seven or eight private mining companies. There is a Mining Administration Bureau in Rongjing County, managing the work of various mining areas, and a geological survey institute is conducting surveys under the auspices of the provincial government.

In terms of agriculture and animal husbandry, a meteorological station is set up in Ba'an, and meteorological substations are set up in various places. A provincial agricultural farm is also set up in Xichang, researching the improvement of products such as rice and cotton. A ranch has been established in Tai'ning, Kangding, to experiment with the improvement of cattle and sheep.

In terms of finance, new economic forces have entered Xikang. There are seven banks in Ya'an and four banks in Xichang.

As for the transportation of Xikang, it was undoubtedly underdeveloped in the past. However, since all parties have attached importance to the border issue, the arteries are now gradually changing. First, there is the Sichuan-Xikang Highway connecting Sichuan and Xikang, which will soon be completed. The section from Ya'an to Kangding is the most difficult section, but due to the intensified work, the completion date is approaching. Secondly, the Kang-Dian Highway in Ning Prefecture is also under construction. The Kang-Qing (Xikang to Qinghai Kukunor) Highway is also under survey. This line is planned to be connected to the Northwest Highway. There is also a biggest attempt, that is, to open up several international highways from Xikang. This plan has recently become possible.

In terms of culture, due to the seclusion in the past, the level of education is extremely superficial. Generally, poor children are unable to attend school because they are engaged in production and maintaining their livelihood. Most of the upper-class children regard entering lama temples to study scriptures as orthodox, so the development of culture is out of the question. There are only five or six magazines in the entire province, circulating in the larger cities, but the thinking is still quite progressive. There are newspapers in Kangding, such as the Xikang News, founded in the 26th year of the Republic of China, and the National Daily, founded on the Double Tenth Festival in the 28th year of the Republic of China. Xichang has the Minfeng Daily and the Anti-Japanese War Weekly. Xichang Weekly. Recently, the well-organized Jianning Daily was published. There is also an anti-Japanese mimeographed newspaper in Ya'an.

### The Invading Japanese Army Suffers Heavy Casualties; Horino is Seriously Wounded and Returns to Shantou for Treatment; Ando Sends Personnel to Shantou to Rebuke Goto

Shantou correspondence: The Japanese army in Chaozhou and Shantou invaded Jieyang. After being ambushed by the Chinese army, the Japanese army suffered heavy losses in the Huangqi Mountain, Battery City, and Fengkou City areas. The Tianpu and Goto units in the northern route retreated to Chao'an City on the 13th, almost losing their army. The Japanese army's highest commander, Major General Horino, retreated to Taoshan Township in Battery City and was surrounded by the Chinese army. He was almost captured alive. His guard fired poison gas bombs to break through the encirclement. Horino's waist and back were pierced by bullets. He was carried by the guard onto a boat and returned to the Shantou Bo'ai Hospital for treatment. The Japanese army in the southern route had no commander, so they were surrounded by the Chinese army in Xigang, Turtle Mountain, Dagangling, Aolingtou, Xiapu Mountain, Tagang, Dahuangkeng, and Shaxitou areas. They could not respond to each other. After Horino returned to Shantou, he handed over the command of the eastern route to the Honshima Regiment commander (Colonel) of Anbu, and telegraphed Guangzhou for assistance.

The Chinese army that severely attacked the Japanese army was the Hua Zhenzhong Brigade. The Hua Brigade was stationed in Sangpu Mountain. When the Japanese army attacked Battery City, the Hua Brigade deliberately let the Japanese army pass, while the Wu Lvxun Regiment guarded the front of Wutagang, Dahuangkeng, and Hong'an Township. The Japanese cavalry took advantage of the situation and quickly advanced, taking a shortcut into Xiapu Mountain (also known as Little Sangpu Mountain, on the side of Dajing Township in Pengzhou), entering Xigang and Taoshan City, and joining forces with the Japanese army that invaded Battery City along the Naxi River waterway, directly attacking Fengkou, Yujiao, and Quxi. However, they were defeated on the 12th and retreated along the original route, so they were severely attacked head-on by the Hua Brigade on Sangpu Mountain. On the 13th, the Chinese army annihilated all the Japanese troops in Shaxitou, Shengjuyang, Longxiangzhai, Tagang, Dahuangkeng, and other places. On the 15th, there were no traces of the Japanese army on the front, back, left, and right of Sangpu Mountain. The Japanese Regiment Commander Honshima led the remnants to gather along the Caitang, Huamei, Anbu, and railway lines, waiting for replenishment and reorganization. More than half of the 1,000-strong puppet army led by Wang Tiancai was killed or wounded, and the rest either surrendered or dispersed. When they retreated to Anbu Longxi Middle School for roll call, there were no more than 200 people. The Japanese and puppet armies suffered a disastrous defeat. Commander Horino and Chao'an Garrison Commander Goto were fully responsible. However, Goto was stubborn and did not admit that the Northern Route Army he commanded had failed (that is, those who invaded along the An-Jie Road). On the 14th, he gathered more than 600 people again and counterattacked Fengxi, Yuntishan, Qingmashan, and Dengtang in two routes, Shanchi Pond and Fuyang, with five tanks and two planes, and fiercely attacked Xitang in Fengxi, firing small cannons in unison, firing six or seven hundred shots per hour. After fighting until 3 pm, the Japanese army suffered more than 100 casualties and retreated to Chihu and Guxi. The sound of cannons in Yuntishan also ceased after dusk.

The Chinese army's sweeping of the Japanese and puppet armies this time was greatly assisted by the air force. At noon on the 13th, when the defeated Japanese soldiers had just arrived outside the south gate of Chao'an and had not yet gained a firm foothold, five Chinese planes appeared in the sky and dropped more than 20 heavy bombs on the Japanese strongholds, causing the Japanese army to dare not love the battle and even abandon the strongholds. The Chinese pursuit troops were able to smoothly search and move the spoils to the rear. On the 14th, the Chinese Air Force again appeared in the Chaozhou-Shantou coastal area to reconnoiter. The Japanese warships anchored in Shantou Port urgently fired up and moved. Those who were working on transporting military supplies temporarily stopped and assisted in the Chao'an operation. The Japanese naval aircraft also dared not fly low and fire guns, and often dropped bombs at an altitude of 5,000 feet, so most of them fell in the wilderness of Fengxi and could not hit the target. On the morning of the 15th, two Chinese silver-winged giant planes appeared on the sea off Shantou and flew to the Hailufeng Dongjiang area to investigate. A Japanese giant cruiser, anchored near Honghai Mountain, was attacked by Chinese aircraft and ten shells were dropped. Two shells hit the target, and the ship was seriously damaged and the bow sank. The two Japanese warships anchored at Houmen automatically sailed away in the afternoon at 1 pm to prevent Chinese aircraft from dropping bombs. Therefore, the Japanese warships on the sea were no longer as peaceful as before in transporting goods. After the disastrous defeat of the Japanese army in Chaozhou and Shantou, the Japanese army in Guangzhou had no reinforcements to transfer, so Ando was quite anxious when he received Horino's request for assistance. On the morning of the 12th, he sent Kang Qian and Tsuchihashi to Shantou by plane to comfort the wounded Horino and investigate the responsibility for the defeat. At noon that day, martial law was imposed in the Qilu Waima Road area, and cavalry galloped up and down. No less than 20 or 30 Japanese officers rode to the Hui Lan Middle School to attend a meeting. The middle school is located on the Conglong Tugang, adjacent to the Japanese Consulate, and very close to the sea. Naval officers also attended the meeting. Puppet officer Huang Dawei rushed from Chenghai. It was heard that Goto was reprimanded by Lieutenant General Kang Qian on the spot, saying that the Northern Route Army should avoid fighting hard battles. Once it passed Meigang along the Anjie Road, it should slant out of Jieyang, Baitou, and Landu, blocking the entrance of Tangkeng Valley, so that the Fengshun Chinese army could not go east to cover the Southern Route Army crossing the river from Fengkou into Jieyang City. After being reprimanded, Goto attacked Fengxi again on the 14th to show that he was not defeated, and that the defeated was Horino's Southern Route Army. However, Horino was seriously injured and did not attend that day.

### Rice Prices Fluctuate Three Times a Day, Abundant Stocks Make Sustained Price Increases Unlikely,  Sikao Te Glutinous Rice Sold Secretly for 46 Yuan

The Xiao Guanghan rice market, after being closed for two days for the spring tomb-sweeping festival, resumed business as usual yesterday. The market opened strong in the morning. Some wholesale merchants were dumping their stock, while only a few retail speculators were selling at high prices. First-grade Saigon rice reached 42 yuan, and "Huojiao" (fire-milled) rice reached 41 yuan, but these prices were too high, making it difficult for most buyers to purchase. With no inquiries, the asking price gradually decreased. First-grade Saigon rice was priced at 41 yuan, and "Huojiao" rice at 39 yuan. This movement prompted rural households to follow suit. For a time, sales were exceptionally brisk, creating the impression of insufficient supply, and prices rose steadily. By midday, first-grade Saigon rice had already sold for 41.5 yuan, second-grade for 38 yuan, "Huojiao" rice for 39.5 yuan, special Siamese rice for 40.05 yuan, second-grade for 38.5 yuan, special Min Dang rice for 40.08 yuan, general rice for 39.5 yuan and 39 yuan, medium-grade rice for 38.5 yuan, small milled rice for 38 yuan, Tokyo glutinous rice for 37.6 yuan, and second-grade for 36.45 yuan. This favorable trend prompted wholesale merchants who had been observing the market to suddenly emerge and dump their goods. The market was instantly crowded, and merchants changed their minds, hesitating to re-enter the market. This led to a decline in sales, and the market suffered a setback, gradually falling back by half a yuan. First-grade Saigon rice was again priced at 41 yuan, and white-bodied small milled rice at 37.5 yuan. From then on, the market hovered, and there was no change until closing. As a result, considering the three rises and falls throughout the day, prices were still higher by half a yuan to six or seven jiao compared to the closing price before the holiday. The source of glutinous rice and other foreign rice coming from the Hongkou district during the two-day closure was quite large, totaling six or seven thousand bags, with glutinous rice being the most abundant. Therefore, even though the glutinous rice market was in a good situation with rising prices for all goods, it uniquely had sluggish sales, showing signs of softening. As for thick and thin japonica rice and early and late rice, prices of foreign rice rose, and people's confidence was also strong. It is said that there were many secret deals outside the market, and prices were generally increasing by three to five jiao. Sikao Te japonica rice was 46 yuan, market price 45.5 yuan, Kun japonica rice 45.2 yuan and 44.5 yuan, Qing Si and Xi Dun special thin rice 44 yuan and 43.4 yuan, Nangang early and late rice original package 43 yuan, wholesale price 40.05 yuan. In general, this kind of market is a necessary reaction after a sharp drop. It would be an unfounded worry to say that the market will continue to rise and re-enact the previous price surge. Considering the abundant stock in Shanghai warehouses and the continuous arrival of future shipments, it can be asserted that this will not happen. It is even more likely that another sharp decline will occur.

Yesterday, a small amount of foreign rice arrived in Shanghai. It was 165 bags from Haiphong and 1,620 bags from Hong Kong transported by Jardine Matheson's "Yusheng" ship, arriving at the port around 8 a.m. yesterday and unloading at the French Concession wharf, Roosevelt Wharf. The "Saagen" ship, managed by the Java Company, loaded rice in Yangon and was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 23rd and be imported tomorrow (the 27th). Now it is said that the arrival has been changed to the 30th.

### Finance: Tomb-Sweeping Holiday Ends, Banks and Money Shops Resume Normal Business

The tomb-sweeping holiday for banks and money shops in this city, which started on the 22nd and included Sunday, lasted for a total of four days. Yesterday it expired, and starting today, all will resume office and operate as usual.

### Metals: New Coil Stock Opened at 300 Loads

The sales of new coil stock, in addition to large-scale purchases by nail factories in this street, also had considerable sales to Tianjin merchants. It is said that the amount opened in the market yesterday reached more than 300 loads, so the market situation was particularly enthusiastic, and people's confidence was also strong. The market price rose by one yuan, and the market price was 50 yuan per load, with some selling at 51 or 52 yuan.

### Nail Factory's Coil Nail Market Price Also Increased

The nail factory's coil nails are mainly purchased by the construction industry in this street. Real sales by Tianjin, Shandong, Qingdao, and Fujian merchants are about 280 barrels or more per day, and the transaction is the most active among metal products. Recently, due to the high asking price of raw materials (coil stock and coil wire), the price of nails has also increased accordingly. The market price is 53 yuan per barrel, which is about 5 jiao to 1 yuan higher than before.

### Tinplate Prices Rise Again

Tinplate transactions were quite active yesterday, as Tianjin merchants made some purchases, and can factories in this street also made purchases, so the market situation was quite lively. Yesterday's asking price was higher than the previous market by 2-3 yuan. For example, 180-pound Italian tinplate was sold for 190 yuan per box, 180-pound American double-linked tinplate was sold for 195-6 yuan per box, and 200-pound American first-class tinplate required about 210 yuan. Small 90-pound tinplate was sold for 110 yuan per box, and 100-pound was sold for 115 yuan, both containing 112 sheets each.

### Import and Export: Tobacco Leaves and Tung Oil Arrive

Imports on the 25th included 1,270 pieces of tea leaves, 120 packages of sugar, and 100 pieces of tobacco leaves from Hong Kong. In addition, 919 pieces of tobacco leaves were transported from Ningbo. 3,500 tins of tung oil were transported from Tianjin. Exports on the 26th included 67 pieces of tea leaves, 56 pieces of piece goods, and 278 pieces of cotton yarn transported to Yantai, and 23 pieces of piece goods and 25 pieces of cotton yarn transported to Tianjin.

### Sugar Market: Sugar Transactions Remain Quiet

Yesterday, the sugar market showed a good trend, but transactions remained quiet, totaling only about 500 bags. The guild's listing price for Grade 24 coarse white spot was up 1 jiao, new goods from foreign warehouses were 62.1 yuan, and the closing price returned to 62 yuan. Taikoo sugar was up 4 jiao, B-mark new goods from western warehouses were 68 yuan, HX-mark goods from eastern warehouses were 64.5 yuan, H-mark old crude sugar was 44.5 yuan, and Dutch red sugar was 48.5 yuan.

### A Review of the Woolen Fabric Market Last Year

— Mao Fang

In the first half of January in the spring season, large and small merchants from Pingjin, Sichuan, Yunnan, Hunan, Guizhou, Zhejiang, and Guangxi all made large purchases. In the second half of the month, the market gradually declined. Because of the winter and spring seasons, the sales of overcoat fabrics in this street decreased. However, the business of ready-made Chinese and Western overcoats in retail stores has actually progressed compared to previous years. Because the population of the isolated island is large, and most of them are not economically well-off, most people wait for real need before making temporary purchases. Transactions were lacking in the first half of February, because both buyers and sellers were busy checking inventory and settling accounts, in order to make a year-end summary. Whether or not there were surpluses among businesses, gathering and loaning funds for transactions was more common than in previous years. With the exception of horsehair lining (due to direct shipping between Shanghai and Ningbo, and the continuous arrival of goods peddled along the way by old women from Jiangshan), felt (due to declining sales to merchants, the street was popular for checkered shoe fabric), and women's color fabric (due to the popularity of long and short pile mohair), the standard market prices for all kinds of wool, cotton, silk, and hemp fabrics were all firm. From the 25th and 26th, the red market successively opened, with an average increase of five percent compared to previous prices. The woolen fabric market made great progress in March, and the prices of all kinds of goods rose without exception. Western-style clothing and door-to-door merchants showed great purchasing strength. Strong merchants included Chongqing, Xufu, Xiding, Jianshui, Kunming in Yunnan, Guiyang, Pingjin, Jinhua, and Wenzhou. Post offices were extremely congested with orders. Large wholesale merchants were quite successful in placing orders with foreign firms for goods to be delivered from warehouses. Italian-made woolen fabrics with Western-style lettering were popular for a time. French flannel rose sharply. Although buyers said the prices were expensive, they were quick to purchase, causing goods to sell out more quickly than in the past. There was a shortage of spring overcoat materials, leading to increased sales of "Huo Mu Si Ben" and "Hai Lv Si." Also, due to the short spring season and warm weather, "Pai Li Si" (Parissi) went on the market early. Due to the scarcity of Western imports, sales of Shanghai woven fabrics and Eastern goods expanded. The phrase "made in England" on Eastern goods that were impounded in Hong Kong, totaling one hundred boxes, and not allowed to be shipped to Shanghai, was confirmed. People in the market were generally optimistic, and insiders and outsiders began to scramble, so even though the real sales period was still far away, the trend was already very popular. Prices rose two or three times. In April, all goods were popular, and market prices rose slightly, causing merchants to be quite active in placing orders. Many orders were placed for autumn-winter and early spring goods. Italian goods with lettering, 42,000 counts at 3 shillings 11.5 pence and 7,000 counts at 5 shillings 6 pence, were especially heavily ordered. Merchants in the interior needed to purchase domestic products, but were hampered by transportation, so in addition to transshipping via Haiphong, everything was delivered by mail. However, due to the congestion of mail delivery, the post office delayed the loading and transportation much more than before the war due to various environmental factors, and shipments were sometimes suspended, making it difficult and greatly reducing purchases by merchants from Sichuan, Yunnan, Hunan, and Guizhou. Transportation via Wenzhou was also very busy, but it was sometimes stopped and started again. Light gray and light-colored woolen fabrics, "Pai Li Si" (Parissi), "Fan Er Ding" (Fanelding), feathers, yellow twill, white canvas, etc., were actually sold a great deal. French flannel and "Hai Lie Si" (Hailyess) were sold well because Western goods were expensive and Eastern goods were not available, and "Guo Yan Ren Li" goods sold briskly. Special door-to-door merchants in the Qipan Street area, starting with Hongxiang, broke the rules of previous years, imitating Western-style shops by adding three extra feet (to a bolt of fabric), competing to reduce prices, or adding four or five feet, and engaging in fierce price competition. In May, the market situation improved again. Summer goods such as white straight tribute (quality cotton), white poplin, yarn twill canvas, hemp canvas, yellow and tea-green twill, "Pang Bi Qu Ba Le" (Pompadour Barré), feathered yarn, "Wan Li Ding Luo Si" (Van Lier Dinglosi), etc., all sold well. Cabbage-green woolen fabrics were popular for a time. Because fewer Japanese goods arrived in port, and many were mixed with artificial cotton wool, the buying power was greatly reduced. Therefore, English and Italian goods still occupied the top position in the Shanghai woolen fabric market, and Shanghai woven woolen fabrics were also quite popular, and had increased compared to the past: (1) because the patterns and colors could be updated at any time, (2) the selling price was always more reasonable than Western and Eastern imports, (3) the delivery period was short and convenient, making it easier to predict changes in market conditions. Unfortunately, the output of the Zhanghua factory was less than half of what it used to be, so the retail store on Nanjing Road was forced to close. Fortunately, the output of the Yinfeng factory was still large, and it was sold through Chunhe and Yonghua Xin, and the business was good. Goods from the British Jardine Matheson factory and the Japanese Yongxing Honglian factory were also widely sold. Transactions were still prosperous in June, with "Wan Li Ding" (Van Lier Ding) selling even better. Gray and dark colors were popular, with demand exceeding supply. On the 8th, the foreign exchange market changed dramatically, with the HSBC exchange rate shrinking from 8 pence to 6.5 pence, like a bolt from the blue. People in the woolen fabric business were uneasy. Dealers who were sampling goods mostly issued notices to temporarily increase prices. From the middle of the month, the Western-style clothing industry also published announcements that the current price of clothing would increase by 20%. The day after the Lunar Dragon Boat Festival, a special telegram was received from the Ministry of Finance, restricting the deposit and withdrawal of legal tender, and at the same time, the discount rate suddenly rose by more than 100 yuan. As a result, woolen fabric transactions went from prosperity to decline, falling sharply. Many woolen fabric prices had not risen enough, and hoarding began again. However, due to the shortage of cash and the fact that most people believed that the market would definitely rise further, not many transactions were made.

New autumn woolen fabric transactions declined slightly. (1) because the prices of goods rose sharply, (2) because the old summer was extremely hot, sales performance was poor. Since the banknotes of place names in North China were no longer used on the 17th, and the black market foreign exchange changed dramatically again on the next day, shrinking from 6.5 pence to 4.15 pence, it was another sudden shock. In the middle of the month, the exchange rate jumped to 150-160 yuan, and everyone in the industry became worried. Everyone either delayed or withdrew from the goods previously ordered from foreign firms. The industry association held a meeting and decided that dealers would change their settlement accounts to monthly accounts, wholesale merchants would change monthly accounts to drafts, and drafts would be changed to cash, with a 10-day limit for check payments and receipts. Most of the prices for autumn-winter goods were based on a cost of 5 pence (regardless of the loss of exchange and the amount of inventory) in order to unify the standard. After drying in mid-autumn, all prices soared. As the black market foreign exchange shrank to 3.15 pence, the cost of importing woolen fabrics increased sharply. The more goods large wholesale merchants ordered, the more worried they became. At the beginning of the month, the association reopened the meeting and decided to calculate the cost at 4.1 pence. The market price of goods was discussed and announced on the spot, and the price list was distributed to each member store. Western-style clothing materials rose even more sharply than Chinese clothing materials. The prices of Zhanghua, Renli, Yihua, Shifeng, Yongxing, Hongkang, Dalong, Xiexin and other factories all increased. After the middle of the month, sales to merchants began to move, and various merchants in this street also had transactions with each other, and the market atmosphere progressed. The trend of all goods rose again. After the signing of the Soviet-German pact, everyone in Europe was at war. Although the pound had returned to 4 pence, there were rumors that customs gold would change its history, and that taxes would have to be paid with "Huaxing" counterfeit money, causing a small amount of terror again. Sellers regarded old inventory as treasures and were unwilling to lower prices, because they all wanted to integrate them with new goods. Since the shilling continued to shrink, the cost increased sharply. (To be continued)

### Old Newspaper Transcriptions Sixty-Seven Years Ago (235) (Extracted from this newspaper in the twelfth year of the reign of Emperor Tongzhi of the Qing Dynasty)

Proposal to Mint Silver Dollars

Chinese Wenbao and foreign Yangfu (silver dollars) can coexist without contradiction, but Yangfu is more convenient to carry. The styles vary from country to country, and British silver dollars are the most circulated. Foreign trade silver dollars are labeled with the word "English," hence the name. Recently, Zhili Governor Li Hongzhang intends to submit a proposal to set up a Yangfu mint in Tianjin. The style will be based on Japanese silver plates, with a circular dragon design in the center, as it closely resembles the style of our dynasty. The weight will be based on British silver dollars, with each dollar weighing 7 qian 1 fen. In Hong Kong and other places, British silver dollars are generally 7 qian 2 fen, while in Shanghai they are generally 7 qian 3 fen.

Imitation of Barrel Donations

From the seventh day of this month, Hangzhou Prefecture has selected fair shop fronts in various bustling areas of the city to install wooden barrels for donations, in order to collect and manage them in the morning and evening, and submit them daily. There are more than 20 barrels in the city, with two fair gentry members in charge of the matter. On the first day of establishment, spectators crowded around, blocking the streets all day long. It is said that the most money was donated in front of the Provincial Treasurer's Office and Qinghefang, as this imitates the barrel donation method in Shanghai.

Wheat Turns into Moths

An old man in the countryside of Suzhou, from a well-off family, feared that the new wheat crop would fail this year due to the continuous rain, so he hoarded hundreds of shi of wheat, intending to profit from scarcity. Recently, while winnowing and drying, he opened the granary to take a look, and saw moths as numerous as the sands of the Ganges River, like snowflakes, flying all over the house. After about half a day, they all scattered into the air, and when he looked back into the granary, not a single grain remained. It is said that the old man is quite stingy, and those who heard about the matter were all delighted.

### International Labor Conference: This Year's Session to Proceed as Usual; Not Interrupted by the European War; Discussion Theme: Cooperation Between Government, Labor, and Capital; Interview with Mr. Lin Kanghou, Chinese Director of the Employers' Group

The International Labor Conference, which holds its annual meeting in Geneva every year, with representatives from governments, employers, and laborers from various countries attending, is now in its twenty-sixth session. Although war has recently broken out in Europe, the International Labor Organization has not ceased its work. Yesterday, a reporter from the New Voice News Agency visited Mr. Lin Kanghou, the Chinese director of the Employers' Group of the Governing Body of the International Labor Office, to inquire about the news of the upcoming International Labor Conference. Mr. Lin kindly provided a detailed account of the preparations for the conference.

Work Continues Despite the Outbreak of the European War

Mr. Lin stated that although some European countries have become belligerents and others are more or less affected by the war, the work of the International Labor Organization has been able to continue as before.

This Year's Conference Scheduled to Be Held

The most notable example is the Second Labor Conference of American Member States of the ILO, which was held in the capital of Cuba last November. This year's (26th) conference is also scheduled to be held. The original agenda for the International Labor Conference included four items for discussion: (1) the organization of labor inspection; (2) weekly rest in commerce and offices; (3) safety equipment in underground work in coal mines; and (4) the rights of workers in the broadcasting, radio, and film industries. However, this agenda was decided before the outbreak of the European war, and it is now practically difficult to discuss these items.

This Year's Agenda Already Decided

In view of this, the International Labor Office suggested that the Governing Body change the agenda for this year's conference. The topic to be discussed at this year's conference will be methods of cooperation between government authorities and labor and capital groups. This issue is extremely important both in peacetime and in wartime. Recently, labor and capital groups in various countries have often been recognized as legal entities. Their activities are strengthened by the encouragement and support of the government, and the government also benefits from the assistance of these groups in implementing policies. For example, wages and other working conditions are currently determined by labor-capital agreements voluntarily concluded by both sides, but these agreements must be supported by the government to be effective. Furthermore, the government often consults with labor and capital groups before formulating social legislation, resulting in more satisfactory outcomes.

European and American Countries Attach Great Importance

Some countries have already granted labor groups the right to initiate social legislation. The participation of labor and capital groups in the implementation of social legislation and the sharing of responsibility for implementing legislation are even more common today. Regarding economic matters, many countries had established economic committees or economic advisory councils before the war to widely solicit the opinions of representatives of labor and capital groups on domestic economic measures. Since the outbreak of the war, this cooperation between government, labor, and capital in economic affairs has become even more important. The issue raised by the International Labor Office this time is to compare and review the current methods of cooperation between government, labor, and capital in various countries. European and American countries attach great importance to this issue, so it can be predicted that this year's conference will yield important results when discussing this issue.

China Has Hope for Re-election to the Governing Body

There are two other issues that were originally planned to be discussed at this year's conference: one is the relationship between price fluctuations and wage policies, and the other is the relationship between social policy, social legislation, and the family. Due to circumstances and time constraints, they may not be included in the agenda. Mr. Lin also said that the members of the Governing Body of the International Labor Office will be re-elected at this year's conference. The Governing Body has a total of thirty-two members, half of whom are government representatives, and the other half are labor and capital representatives. They are re-elected every three years. Eight of the sixteen government representatives are appointed by the governments of the eight major industrial countries, and the other eight are appointed by the member states elected by the government representatives of the conference. As for the eight employer representatives and the eight worker representatives, they are elected separately by the employer representatives and the worker representatives attending the conference. China was elected as a member of the government group in 1934 and 1937, and Mr. Li Pingheng was appointed by the National Government to serve. As for myself, I was elected as a member of the employer group in the re-election in 1937. During this year's re-election, I hope that China can be re-elected.

### A "Floral Cloth" Boat Carrying Scrap Metal Detained by the Japanese; Over a Hundred Loads of Shells and Bullets Discovered and Confiscated; Boat Crew Detained

Yao Jinhua, a native of Baoshan, loaded over thirty bales of "floral cloth" from Luodian the day before yesterday to transport to Shanghai for sale. When passing through Wusongkou, Japanese soldiers from the wharf inspection office boarded the boat and searched it, discovering over a hundred loads of scrap metal, including shells and bullets, in the hold. The Japanese considered these to be contraband and confiscated the boat and cargo, and detained Yao Jinhua and three crew members, escorting them to the military police for interrogation. It is said that the total value of the boat and cargo is over ten thousand taels of gold, and there is little hope of their return.

### Banking and Financial Institutions Show Special Caution in Lending After the Holiday

Member banks and financial firms of the Shanghai Banking and Financial Industry Association, as well as foreign banks, had a four-day Tomb Sweeping Day holiday starting on the 23rd of this month, which has now ended. They all resumed business today. The black market for foreign exchange, gold, securities, and other items, as well as the money market for interbank lending rates and the market for currency exchange, also opened for trading today. The two associations of banking and financial institutions and the preparatory treasury have also resumed operations. In light of the frenzy of speculation in Shanghai after the general settlement, with the main targets of speculation being foreign exchange and currency, goods such as rice, cotton yarn, metals, pigments, Western medicine, and various daily necessities have been affected, impacting the currency system and the people's livelihood. To prevent speculation, in addition to not engaging in such illegal business themselves, the banks and financial institutions are being particularly cautious about mortgage lending for goods, so as not to fuel speculation.

### Public Bus Company Denies Further Fare Increases

After increasing workers' salaries last month, there were rumors that the British-owned China General Omnibus Company would raise fares again starting on April 1st. Reporters inquired with the company's authorities, who denied this claim. The public believes that although the company's expenses are significant, Shanghai has a dense population and the public bus business is doing well. The public bus company has already raised prices several times in recent years, and passengers are already feeling a significant burden. Therefore, the public welcomes the company's denial of further fare increases.

Passengers Suggest Crackdown on "Skimming"

Yesterday, the North China Daily News published a letter from a reader named Mr. Xu, which stated: It is rumored that the British-owned General Omnibus Company will increase fares again starting from April 1st. However, the city has a dense population, and the crowding on public buses is unprecedented. The company's profits must be quite high. One thing that is particularly regrettable is that the company's authorities are well aware that ticket sellers are "skimming" and causing the company's income to decrease, but they are not taking measures to remedy this. They are only increasing the burden on the public who ride the buses. It should be known that repeated fare increases will not only be opposed by the public but will also benefit dishonest ticket sellers even more. Therefore, the company should cooperate with the public to permanently eliminate "skimming." This would benefit both parties, and the public would be willing to cooperate to achieve this goal. The editor of the North China Daily News added a note saying: According to inquiries with the British-owned General Omnibus Company, the company does not intend to increase fares starting from early April. Regarding the "skimming" issue, the company currently has thirty to forty ticket inspectors who board buses at any time to check tickets. This number is probably the highest rate of ticket inspectors employed by any public bus company in the world.

### The China-America Daily Was Attacked Again Yesterday Morning; Two Hand Grenades, Fortunately Did Not Explode; Prior to the Incident, Threatening Letters Were Received Repeatedly

The China-America Daily, located at 160 Avenue Edward VII in this city, has been praised by people from all walks of life for its upright stance and impartial arguments. Last autumn, it suffered an unprecedented attack in the history of the newspaper industry. Fortunately, the newspaper's defenses were effective, and the attack failed. Unexpectedly, at about 6:30 yesterday morning, while the newspaper was being distributed, a person suddenly broke in, looking for the newspaper office. At that time, the newspaper's distribution entrance

was half-closed. A servant named Bao Kang (16 years old, from Haimen, serving for only a month or so) was organizing utensils in the kitchen. In addition, there were also one staff member and one servant who were busy at work. Thinking that he was a newspaper vendor, they had no doubts. In an instant, suddenly a hand grenade flew in and landed next to a spittoon, but it did not explode. While everyone was shocked,

another hand grenade

flew in and landed under the wire mesh window of the counter, and it did not explode either. A disaster was narrowly avoided. After the shock, everyone frantically blew the police whistle, and the thug turned around and fled. The doorman of the building heard the alarm and rushed to the scene and immediately reported to the police station. The police station immediately dispatched armed Chinese and Western detectives to patrol and take the two hand grenades

back to the police station

for storage, and at the same time investigate and pursue the thugs. It is reported that the French police had detained a suspect. Whether it is related to this case is currently under strict interrogation. According to the cleaning lady of the building, the thug was a young man dressed in blue cloth overalls, about twenty years old. When he came in, he asked the cleaning lady where the China-America Daily was located. After a while, she saw him

hurriedly leave the building

and flee outwards. Because the bombs did not explode, she did not know that he was the thug who threw the bombs. It is also heard that the newspaper has received threatening letters repeatedly in the past few months. The general content is to warn the newspaper to stop publishing immediately. The most recent one was received just two weeks ago. The publisher of the newspaper, Steiger (an American), also received similar letters, and some were sent from Hong Kong in mimeographed form. The content and form were consistent with the above-mentioned letters.

### The Splendor of the Chinese Corps' Encampment; The Entire Corps' Grand Review Will Receive Special Honor

The Chinese Corps and Translation Corps of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps have an annual encampment and training exercise to conduct vocational training in accordance with the Corps' regulations. This year's Translation Corps encampment was held on the 17th and 18th of last month, and the Chinese Corps was held on the previous two days. The location was the Public Works Department's Drill Hall. It is learned that this year's encampment focused on practicality and simplicity to adapt to the current

defense needs.

Various courses, such as setting up barbed wire and piling sandbags, sand table strategic lectures, dispersing rioters, and street fighting exercises, etc., were held from noon on the first day until the evening of the second day. Except for meal and accommodation time, there was almost no free time. Under the leadership of Corps Commander Major Chen Shixia, all the members of the corps were able to cooperate and work diligently. Therefore, the

results were excellent

over the two days. On the afternoon of the second day, an awards tea party was held in the camp. Major General Xu Tonghao, the leader of the corps, was specially invited to present awards from the previous year, including certificates for 30 years of service and proficiency cups, as well as full attendance cups for the year. Others received certificates for 20 years, 15 years, 10 years, 5 years, or 3 years, totaling more than a hundred people. After the awards ceremony, comedians He Shuangdai and Shen Xiaoting volunteered to perform entertainment, and there was laughter throughout the hall until late at night. Furthermore, April 14th is the date of the

Corps' grand review.

According to custom, the corps flag is led by troops from other countries for decades. This year, the corps commander, Colonel Xiang Di, considering the outstanding achievements of the Chinese Corps over the years, specially appointed them as the flag guard to show honor. This is truly an unprecedented honor for our Corps. It is said that this flag guard consists of one hundred people, who will be

selected from the members of the Chinese and Translation Corps,

fifty from each corps, led by Battalion Commander Chen Shixia and Lieutenants Zhou Qingen and Xu Shaomei, and military clerk Huang Guohua. The remaining members of the Chinese and Translation Corps will be led by Lieutenants Yu Xianen, Wang Tingkui, Ji Yushu, Xia Zaiyu, Zhong Yuting, and Zhang Tinggui to participate. It is heard that the 34th recruitment of new corps members will begin after the grand review. This recruitment emphasizes member introductions. Any respectable Chinese merchants who are interested in joining can write to the Corps Headquarters at 221 Fuzhou Road to request registration information.

### Second Phase of Low-Priced Coal Briquettes to Begin Tomorrow; Limited to 2 Jiao (4 Jin) Per Person Per Purchase; Hot Water Industry Leaders Received Low-Priced Coal Yesterday, Negotiating for Reduced Water Prices

The first phase of low-priced coal briquettes ended and was temporarily suspended on the 22nd of this month. The second phase is scheduled to begin tomorrow for a period of ten days. All the low-priced sales locations have been designated separately, and will be announced as soon as they are ready. Sales will begin every day from 2:00 PM until the supply is exhausted. Each person is limited to purchasing 2 Jiao, which is 4 Jin. The white cloth signs for each low-priced sales location have been sent by the Coal Briquette Association, and letters were sent to each low-priced coal supplier and each low-priced sales location yesterday, notifying them that the period for low-priced coal sales

will be from March 27th to April 5th, for a total of ten days. The total amount of coal briquettes sold at low prices each day is 1,035. The total amount for the ten days is 10,350.

Hot Water Industry Leaders Received Low-Priced Coal Yesterday. After the price of smokeless white coal blocks soared, related industries were greatly affected. In addition to the hotel industry, which has publicly agreed to increase prices at hotels with water heating systems, the hot water industry and the bathhouse industry have appealed to all sectors of society to lower coal prices, stating the importance of their industries to social stability and the livelihood of ordinary people. The Shanghai Coal Industry Association supplied various low-priced coal Jin and gave the Hot Water Industry Association members a second supply of low-priced coal (No. 2 Hongji coal dust). It began yesterday, supplied by Yitaixing, Huazhong, and Yuantai, three larger coal companies, at a flat price of 50 yuan per ton, which is 38 yuan lower than the first time. Yesterday, the first day, a total of about 100 tons of low-priced coal were sold. After the application to purchase coal began at 9:00 AM yesterday, the order was very good. All the owners of the tiger stove shops held their shop and personal licenses for this year and applied to purchase coal in accordance with the regulations. Members of the Hot Water Industry Association were dispatched to the site to guide.

Each Household Receiving Coal Generously Acknowledges Difficulty in Donating. Under the leadership of the chairman of the association, Zhang Delong, a donation was initiated to collect refugee relief funds of 10 yuan per household to donate to the Refugee Relief Association, the Low-Priced Rice Committee, and the Refugee Children's Home as refugee relief funds. Once the amount is reached, it will be sent separately to each receiving agency to obtain an official receipt. All sectors of the city are paying close attention to this righteous act of the industry, and it is known that after obtaining a large amount of low-priced coal, the selling price will be reduced to benefit the common people.

### After the Tomb Sweeping Day Market Closure, Rice Prices Slightly Rebounded; Foreign Warehouses Did Not Resume Business Yesterday, and Goods Could Not Be Withdrawn; Speculators Took the Opportunity to Disrupt the Market and Will Be Strictly Investigated

The rice industry's tea house market in the city opened yesterday after a two-day Tomb Sweeping Day holiday. However, foreign warehouses have not yet resumed business, and goods cannot be withdrawn. Rice stores have slightly less stock due to the two-day market closure. After the market reopened yesterday, speculators were given the opportunity to raise prices. No. 1 Saigon rice rose again to over 40 yuan per stone in national currency. According to investigations, the current stock of rice in the city is over one million stones, and the foreign rice that was successively pre-ordered has been arriving in recent days. The domestic rice transported from the inner harbor is also gradually flowing smoothly, with no less than 3,000 bags arriving every day. Therefore, the black market for domestic rice prices no longer exists. The price of domestic rice transported to Shanghai from the Sijing area does not exceed the limit of 40 yuan per stone. The abnormal rebound in the price of foreign rice is entirely due to the reaction of a group of speculators after the rice price fell, attempting to plunge the rice market into chaos again. However, the authorities in the two concessions are actively controlling prices and will strictly investigate the speculative actions of these people. Yesterday, over 5,000 bags of social rice arrived in Shanghai. The foreign rice Yih He foreign company's Yusheng ship arrived in Shanghai yesterday, carrying 1,620 bags from Hong Kong and 165 bags from Haiphong. In addition, a foreign ship arrived with nearly 30,000 packages. Under various reasons, such as rice merchants having abundant stocks, a surge in arrivals, increased warehouse rent, and the Civil Food Adjustment Association's efforts to raise funds to continue handling low-priced sales, rice prices can be expected to fall back immediately.

### Order Issued by the Ministry of Finance to Promote Domestic Remittances; Remittances to Shanghai and Other Ports Must Be Approved; and Limited to Funds for Daily Necessities Designated by the Ministry

The Ministry of Finance believes that domestic remittance is one of the important businesses of banks, and remittance fees should be reduced and channels facilitated to revitalize finance and promote economic development. Since the war of resistance, commercial banks have not had consistent domestic remittance rates. Although due to transportation and other reasons, the independent determination of the fees has had an impact on facilitating commerce and the people's livelihoods and vitalizing finance. To correct this, the "Provisional Measures to Promote Domestic Remittances" has been reviewed and approved, and orders have been issued to the Banking and Financial Industry Association in various places to instruct member banks to comply.

Provisional Measures. The measures stipulate that the domestic remittance rates shall be determined by local banks in consultation, taking into account the distance, expenses, and other factors. The list of remittance rates for remittances to major cities across the country shall be posted in front of the remittance locations in the banks for remitters to be aware of at any time. The remittance rates table and its changes shall be reported to the Ministry of Finance monthly for verification. The four central agricultural banks and their branches have been ordered to comply.

Audit Procedures. The audit procedures for domestic remittances are as follows: (1) Remittances from ports to inland areas are free of charge. (2) Remittances between inland areas shall be remitted at the rates set by the Ministry. (3) Remittances from inland areas to ports are limited to funds for daily necessities designated by the Ministry and must be reviewed by the four central agricultural banks. As for the demarcation between ports and inland areas, (1) ports are Shanghai, Hong Kong, Kowloon, Ningbo, Wenzhou, Fuzhou, Quanzhou, Guangzhou Bay, Chikan, Longzhou, Gulangyu, Shantou, Nanning, and other food locations. (2) Inland areas are all areas other than the ports and occupied areas.

Application Procedures. (1) Inland importers who import goods from ports shall apply to the local four banks for a permit to remit funds for transporting goods from the inland area before the order is sent. (2) After the application is approved by the four banks, the permit shall be issued, and the four banks in the port shall be notified to register. (3) Exporters in the port shall, before shipment, submit invoices and apply to the local four banks for a shipping certificate. (4) The four banks in the port shall, upon verifying that the application has been notified by the four banks in the inland area and that a permit has been issued, issue a shipping certificate. (5) When the goods arrive at the destination, the importer shall submit an invoice and shipping certificate and apply to the local four banks for verification. (6) After verification by the four banks in the inland area, the four banks shall apportion the remittance pro rata.

Incentives for Internal Transfer. Remittances from ports such as Shanghai to inland areas are exempt from remittance fees and are not restricted. For example, Shanghai stipulates that deposits made after August 13 can be paid in one lump sum when remitted to the inland area and are not subject to restrictions on withdrawals. Banknotes with place names such as Tianjin, Shandong, and Wuhan can be remitted to the inland area for the purchase of local goods. These measures are all government incentives for the internal transfer of funds. However, although the funds remitted from the inland area to various ports are specially approved by the four banks, the remittance fee is higher than that between the inland areas. For example, the remittance fee from Chongqing to Shanghai is about 100 yuan, while the fee from Henan, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Fujian provinces in the inland area is 15 yuan per thousand yuan, and the fee from Hubei, Hunan, Guangxi, Guizhou, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai is 5 yuan per thousand yuan.

### Primary Election for American Candidates to the Municipal Council: Vote Counting Today

The primary election for American candidates to the Municipal Council ended yesterday. The vote counting is scheduled to take place publicly at 5:00 PM today at the American Association office on Fuzhou Road. According to reporters, the American Association has invited McMillan and Li Jiang and other three people as the vote counters during the vote counting. Americans are welcome to visit.

### Painting a Picture of Peace: The Japanese Side Opens the Southern City; Trial Run for One Week Starting Yesterday; Externally Relaxed, Internally Tightened Inspection Remains Unabated

The Japanese side intends to "prosper" its occupied areas, so the permit system in Zhabei and Hongkou was canceled one after another. From yesterday, the permit system in the Southern City was also temporarily canceled. The details are recorded as follows:

Trial Run for One Week. The Japanese side intends to "revive" its occupied areas, so the permit system in Hongkou and Zhabei was canceled at the beginning of this month, officially opening the areas to induce Chinese to return. From 10:00 AM yesterday, the Japanese army also canceled the permit system in the Southern City after consultation between the Japanese army and navy. The decision was made to conduct a trial run for one week. If the results are "good", the cancellation will be long-term. The purpose is nothing more than to induce Chinese to return to achieve its goal of "prospering" the market. On the one hand, because the "new regime" is about to take the stage, five archways were built at New Bridge Street, Old West Gate, Small West Gate, Small East Gate, Great East Gate.

Few People Went There. After the permit system in the Southern City was canceled, the Japanese side originally wanted to suspend the inspection work at the same time. However, the Navy, considering that the Southern City's military strength was weak, was sincerely afraid that after the inspection was canceled, patriotic elements would enter the Southern City and carry out activities, so at the meeting the night before last, it strongly advocated maintaining the status quo. According to investigations yesterday, although the inspection work still exists on the surface, in reality, only those who are suspected are inspected. In addition, due to the weak military strength, there is only one Japanese soldier and three puppet police officers at each entrance and exit. However, there are still very few citizens who go there, so the Japanese army's attempt is only a pie in the sky, and "prosperity and revival" is even more difficult.

### Shanghai Post Office Decides to Accept Parcels to Kunming;滇越路; Yunnan-Vietnam Railway Has Not Been Restored Since Bombing; This Move Affects Shanghai's Commercial Prosperity

The Shanghai Postal Administration has decided to resume accepting parcels from Shanghai to Kunming, which has a significant impact on Shanghai's overall commercial prosperity. Our agency reporter is here to record it in detail.

Stopped Since Yunnan-Vietnam Railway Bombing. Parcels from Shanghai to Kunming are transferred via Haiphong and transported by the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. Since the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway was bombed, acceptance has been suspended. Although the railway bureau has repaired it, a large number of parcels have been stockpiled locally, waiting to be cleared. Therefore, parcels between Shanghai and Yunnan have not been restored.

Resume Acceptance This Week. Recently, the Shanghai Parcel Transportation Company has repeatedly sent personnel to request the Shanghai Post Office to resume accepting parcels to Kunming as soon as possible to facilitate the promotion of goods. After the bureau telegraphed the postal authorities in Haiphong to inquire, it has been approved. Therefore, the bureau decided to resume accepting parcels to Kunming starting this week.

Relocating to Shilu Road Is Not True. According to the person in charge of the bureau, although the parcel group located in the bureau on the Sichuan Road Bridge is quite inconvenient for the public to travel to and from because the northern Jiangxi Road Suzhou River along the bank was blocked by the Japanese, there is no suitable space for a large number of parcels to be stacked in the two concessions south of the bridge. Therefore, the group could not be relocated. The rumor that it was relocated to the Shilu Road Post Office is not true.

### Anti-Drug Pioneer, Mr. Huang Jiaohui, Passed Away

Mr. Huang Jiaohui, the founder and executive director of the Chinese National Anti-Drug Association, dedicated his life to the anti-drug movement. For more than ten years, his reputation spread throughout the country, and the country followed suit. Hundreds of anti-drug branches were established nationwide, with remarkable achievements. International audio-visuals have been renewed. At the same time, he also founded the Chinese Charity Association with local celebrities such as Kuang Fuzhuo, Li Denghui, Guo Baoyi, and Gao Fengchi, and served as the first executive director, benefiting the disaster-stricken children and being well-known. Unfortunately, he passed away due to cancer at the Zhongbi Radium Therapy Hospital on Xiafei Road in this city at 6:30 PM on March 24, at the age of forty-two. Chinese and foreign relatives and friends were shocked and saddened by the news. It is now scheduled to be held at the Wanguo Funeral Home on Jiaozhou Road at 2:00 PM on Saturday, the 30th of this month, and the funeral service will be held and moved to the Public Works Department Cemetery on Hongqiao Road. Mr. Huang had a wide range of social interactions during his lifetime, and at that time, plain cars and white horses will be extremely honored.

### Continued Negotiations for the Supply of Low-Priced Flour Yield Results; Municipal Council to Reply Tomorrow at 3 PM

The Shanghai Noodle Industry Association, concerned about the recent soaring flour prices which greatly affect the industry's business and the people's food supply, had petitioned the Municipal Council on the 19th of last month, requesting the Fuxin and Fufeng flour mills to supply 225,000 bags of low-priced flour. As that supply period ends on the 19th of this month, and considering the current high rice prices, noodles are a staple food for the common people. The association argued that once the supply of low-priced flour ceases, the noodle industry would be forced to purchase high-priced recycled flour, raising the price of noodles from 2 jiao 3 fen per jin to 2 jiao 8 fen, significantly impacting the livelihood of ordinary people. Therefore, they dispatched representatives to implore the Municipal Council to negotiate with the mills to continue the supply of low-priced flour. Although the Municipal Council was observing the Easter holiday, it remained mindful of the people's food supply and continued negotiations with the mills. Now, results have been achieved, and the industry will receive a reply tomorrow at 3 PM.

### Free Maternity Hospital

— Min

In Shanghai, finding a truly free maternity hospital is practically impossible. We often see advertisements in newspapers for "10 yuan delivery" or "15 yuan delivery," but these amounts are sometimes beyond the means of the poor. Each year, even just in Shanghai, countless poor pregnant women are unable to receive proper delivery care and nutrition, leading to the deaths of mothers and children. It's a pity we don't have statistics! I think.

However, in this era, we actually have a People's Maternity Hospital. This hospital was founded after the outbreak of the Shanghai war when refugees flooded in. Its purpose is to provide care for refugee pregnant women and offer free deliveries. Based on over a year of experience, the poor people of Shanghai greatly need this hospital.

The current hospital address is 737 Weihaiwei Road. The location is small, and the number of beds is limited, so they cannot accommodate all the pregnant women who arrive. Local Chinese and foreign figures, such as Mrs. Fei Xiu, the German Ambassador's wife, Mrs. Yan Huiqing, Feng Bingnan, Bu Fangji, and Xue Erge, are very interested in this organization. For over a year, they have provided significant spiritual and material support. Now, a fundraising campaign is underway with a target of 50,000 yuan.

To understand the hospital's past work, we asked Mr. Lu Meiseng to introduce us to Mrs. Yu Yingjie. Mrs. Yu is a very capable and virtuous woman. She has devoted her utmost effort to this hospital, even more diligently and enthusiastically than to her own affairs.

Here are a few stories she told us:

One day, a thin, elderly woman came to the hospital alone. She was full-term and seemed about to give birth. We first inquired about her family situation. She replied, "I only have two children, no one else. The elder one is a girl, currently ten years old, and the younger one is a boy, only seven years old." When we asked about her husband, she told us the familiar story of her husband going out to find work and never being heard from again. She said that her family originally farmed in Anhui, leading a comfortable life with a few acres of land. Later, her hometown was occupied, forcing her family to flee with great hardship to Shanghai, where they settled in a refugee camp. After several months, her husband grew restless. However, he was a farmer, and in this industrial city, he had nowhere to turn for help. Shortly after she became pregnant, her husband left his wife and children to find work, and has not been heard from since. So we admitted her to the hospital. The next day, she gave birth to a boy. He stopped breathing at birth, but the woman did not seem concerned about the infant's crying. Soon, she suddenly began to sob. We thought she was sad because the baby wasn't crying, so we comforted her, telling her we would do our best to save the baby, and that the child had a good chance of survival. Unexpectedly, these words not only failed to comfort her, but made her cry even more sadly. She said to the doctor caring for the infant: "Doctor, please don't save the child. I don't want him to live. Please have pity on us, mother and child. I wish the child would die now to avoid suffering and dying of hunger and cold in the future. I am already struggling to care for my other two children, and they are currently hungry and half-frozen! Doctor, please let him die. If you do, I will be eternally grateful." However, the infant was saved. When the woman left the hospital, she left her baby behind. She felt that the child would be better off living anywhere else than with her. One afternoon around four o'clock, a poor couple came to the hospital. The woman was about to give birth and requested admission to the hospital. It was October, and the weather was not very cold, but the couple was thinly dressed and seemed unable to bear the cold, especially the woman, who was pale and trembling. However, our hospital beds had been full since yesterday, and we could not accommodate any more. We had already turned away two women in labor that day, so we told them we could not admit them. The couple pleaded with us, saying they would sleep anywhere and leave the hospital immediately after giving birth. However, despite their repeated pleas, we really could not accommodate them. The couple was very disappointed, and the woman was already in tears. As they were about to leave, the man turned back to me and sobbed, "Sir, Miss, please save us. If you don't help us, who will? We really have nowhere to go." We felt very sorry for him, but we really couldn't help. We hadn't started offering outpatient delivery services yet. Before the couple left the hospital, we told them they could come to us for delivery when she was in labor. About a week later, they still hadn't come. A female midwife, driven by curiosity, went to their home and found the woman lying on tattered, dirty cotton wadding, running a high fever. The husband said that they went home and she gave birth to a stillborn child that night. He didn't come to ask us for help because there was no one to ask for him or care for his wife. The woman fell ill after childbirth, sometimes showing slight improvement, sometimes worsening. We didn't know what she was suffering from, so we told her to go to the Shanghai Refugee Hospital.

### Gambling Den in Yuyuan Targeted in Bombing; Nine Injured, One Severely

Last night around 10 PM, at the gambling den located behind the Yunfei Motor Company at the end of Jing'an Temple Road in western Shanghai, while the lights were bright and the gamblers were in high spirits, a large bomb was unexpectedly thrown next to a chair on the left side of gambling table number three on the lower floor. The loud explosion shocked the neighbors. Eight male and female gamblers and one employee were injured on the spot. Their names are listed below: Zhu Yinchun, 19 years old, residing in Xinkang Lane, Caojiadu; Hua Zhenqing, 39 years old, residing at 7 Baike Road, from Jinhua; Qiu Guangfu, 30 years old, residing on the upper floor of the Yuanji Money Shop in Renzhi Lane, Sichuan Road; Shen Zuliang, residing at 27, Lane 80, An'nan Road, from Ningbo; Shen Liu-shi, 27 years old, residing at the same address; Chen Zhihua, 37 years old, residing at 486 Fuxu Road, from Ningbo; Li Zhiliang, 33 years old, residing at 16 Dexing Lane, North Jiangxi Road, from Jiaxing; Qiao Amao, address unknown. All of the above were injured in the legs. In addition, an employee named Tang Qun, 28 years old, local, residing at 4, Yongji Lane, Avenue Haig, suffered seven or eight shrapnel wounds to the buttocks, and his condition is extremely serious, potentially life-threatening. After the incident, the injured were immediately sent to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. When reporters rushed to investigate, the eight male and female gamblers all had minor leg injuries. After being bandaged by doctors, they went home together. Only the employee, Tang Qun, was hospitalized for treatment.

### Former Manager of Dazhong Motor Company Accused of Embezzlement and Breach of Trust

Liu Yunting and Li Qusheng, owners of the Guangming Electrical Materials Shop at 371 Avenue Joffre, recently retained lawyer Zhou Lin to file a lawsuit in the Criminal Division of the Special District Court, accusing Wang Zhongyu (43 years old this year, from Kunshan, owner of the Wang Zhongji Battery Shop at 341 Avenue Joffre) of embezzlement and breach of trust under Articles 336 and 342 of the Criminal Law. The court accepted the case, and Judge Li Weishen opened the second hearing yesterday morning. According to the plaintiffs, in October of the 20th year of the Republic (1931), they gathered with Cao Huadi, Qian Xingen, Zhang Xingbei, and others to raise 10,000 yuan to establish the Dazhong Xieji Automobile Company, and they elected the defendant as the manager. Because the defendant lacked experience, the company experienced financial difficulties and closed down in March of the 24th year of the Republic (1935). Six automobiles remained. One car was used to offset the debt to Zhang Xingbei, and the remaining five cars were entrusted to the defendant to sell at a good price. Unexpectedly, the defendant sold the cars privately, and for five years, he has not handed over a single cent. Therefore, the court is requested to punish him according to the law and, in addition, to request compensation for damages of more than 17,000 yuan in a civil suit. The defendant, defended by lawyer Wu Xiangzhen, claimed that the proceeds from the sale of all the cars had been used to pay off debts, so the defendant did not commit any crime. The court questioned both parties and then adjourned the hearing to a later date. Because the defendant was suspected of committing a crime, he was ordered to provide a cash bail of 1,000 yuan and a shop guarantee that he would appear when summoned. If he could not provide bail, he would be detained.

### Zhou Weishan Accused of Attempted Murder

Qu Fengnan, 43 years old, from Muping, Shandong, recently filed a lawsuit in the Special District Court, accusing his fellow villager Zhou Weishan, currently residing in the Yudesheng Company on the second floor of the Xinshengchang Customs Brokerage on Jixiang Street, of attempted murder and embezzlement of shares. The plaintiff claimed that he had shares in the Xinshengchang Customs Brokerage and served as assistant manager. In the 23rd year of the Republic (1934), he returned to his hometown on business. Unexpectedly, the defendant, Chen Yushan's authorized representative and a shareholder of the company, forcibly took away his shares. When he returned to Shanghai to discuss the matter, the defendant attempted to have him killed. He requests that the matter be investigated according to the law. The court accepted the case, and Judge Zhang Minsheng held a hearing and adjourned it to a later date for further testimony. Yesterday afternoon, the hearing resumed. The defendant, accompanied by his lawyers Jiang Yiping and Li Gengxiang, appeared in court and denied all the accusations. He also filed a counterclaim of false accusation. Witness Pu Zengsheng testified, stating that he works in the Taikoo Dockyard's ship room and previously had shares in the Xinshengchang Customs Brokerage. There were only five shareholders, and the plaintiff did not have any shares, only serving as a runner. He has now sold his shares to others, etc. After verifying the testimonies, the court ordered Pu to sign a pledge. Since the facts of the case were clear, the court ordered closing arguments and announced the adjournment, with the verdict scheduled for the 28th.

### Armed Gang Activity on Connaught Road; Five Cases Committed in One Hour; Detectives Attacked During Search; Six Suspects Apprehended

The North-China Daily News reports that yesterday (the 24th) morning, Connaught Road, adjacent to "badlands," became a center of criminal activity in Shanghai again. Armed gangs committed five cases in one hour. In two of the cases, public concession police officers were ambushed. A Western employee of the British-owned Shanghai Public Omnibus Company and his driver were also robbed. Although the police officers were

Fired Upon By Gangsters
Nearly twenty shots were fired, but none were injured. The gangsters were hiding in alleys in the outer district, and the police officers were unable to return fire. This area has repeatedly experienced robberies and shootings, and the perpetrators always flee into the outer district. Details of yesterday's cases are as follows. A Shanghai Public Omnibus Company employee, Mr. Strong Mungall, was driving his own car to work on Connaught Road at 2:15 AM when

Three Thieves Jumped Out
And ordered the driver to stop. This location was about 200 yards west of Yanping Road on Connaught Road, near where Mr. Short, the company's manager, had recently been held up and threatened by armed men. All three thieves brandished pistols, pointed them directly at Mr. Strong and his driver, and forced them to hand over their money. The three thieves stole 115 yuan and fled into the darkness without firing a shot. Mr. Strong then reported the robbery to the police station, stating that the three thieves all spoke with a Jiangbei accent. Coincidentally,

Shortly After Mr. Strong Was Robbed
At approximately 2:35AM, the police search team from the Gordon Road police station was fired upon from behind while on Connaught Road. The assailant was armed with a Mauser pistol, and fired fifteen shots at the search team from an alley in the outer district. Shortly afterwards, the search team was reinforced by uniformed and plainclothes officers dispatched from the police station. While searching for the bandits on Connaught Road, they were again fired upon by thugs from another dark alley in the outer district. This time, only two or three shots were fired. The police

Still Didn't Return Fire
In addition, another case occurred on Connaught Road at 2:00 AM yesterday morning. Six thieves broke into a tailor shop at 372 Connaught Road, stealing three sewing machines, a pair of candlesticks, and ten pieces of clothing material, valued at approximately 180 yuan. The thieves did not use guns, but they were certainly armed. Gordon Road police officers conducted a search, arresting six suspects, several of whom are believed to be the perpetrators of the crimes along Connaught Road.

### Britain and France Establish Intelligence Bureaus in Shanghai to Provide Accurate Information

The British and French propaganda efforts in Shanghai have recently been greatly strengthened. Yesterday, the French authorities also announced that they would establish a military intelligence bureau in Shanghai, headed by Mr. Miller, an attaché at the French Embassy in China. The office will be located at 2 Avenue de la Gare Municipal Council, telephone number 80080. According to the British government, they also established a military intelligence bureau in Shanghai several months ago. The office is located in the British Consulate, and is headed by Mr. Tyrrell. The purpose of these measures by Britain and France is to enable people of all countries in Shanghai to obtain accurate information and not be misled by other unsubstantiated news.

### Foreign Journalists Return to Shanghai from Nanjing

According to foreign sources, a group of more than twenty foreign journalists who went to Nanjing from Shanghai on the 19th to attend the opening ceremony of the so-called "Central Political Conference" have returned to Shanghai. It is reported that they were "warmly received by the Nanjing faction" while they were in Nanjing. The group included Mr. Maurius, the Far East director of the United Press, Mr. Ford, a reporter for the English-language China Press, and Mr. Victor Keay, a reporter for the New York Herald Tribune. According to one of the foreign journalists, they may make another trip to Nanjing next week.

### Radio Equipment for Export Intercepted by Customs; Temporarily Detained Due to Lack of Official Agency Certification

The Jianghai Customs Outfield Investigation Team received a tip the night before last that a certain ship was carrying military contraband for export. They immediately rushed to search the ship. As a result, dozens of radio transmitters and a large amount of radio equipment were seized. It was also discovered that the exported goods did not have the official certification documents issued by organizations such as the City Chamber of Commerce. This is in clear violation of the export regulations promulgated after the war, and the purpose and use of the export are unclear. Therefore, all the seized items have been temporarily detained. Unless satisfactory proof is provided by the relevant supervisory authority, the items will be confiscated and forfeited to the government.

### New Drug and Pharmaceutical Industries to Sell Rice at Low Prices; Locations Selected, Events to Be Held on Schedule

The Shanghai New Drug and Pharmaceutical Industries Association has decided to sell white rice at low prices, at 1 jiao per jin, limited to 2 jin per person, due to the high price of rice and the difficulty for the poor to maintain a livelihood. The sales will take place daily from 10 AM to 12 PM at the McDonald Memorial Church and the Zhiyuan Dharma Assembly on Rue du Père Huc. It was originally scheduled to start today, but the McDonald Memorial Church event has been temporarily postponed because the police believe it would be difficult to maintain order and have ordered that a different location be found. The Zhiyuan Dharma Assembly event will be implemented on April 1st after the Dharma service is completed.

### Conviction for Transporting Opium

Chai Zhini (51 years old, from Ningbo) was carrying five feather dusters tied with rope on the afternoon of the 11th of this month at 5:45 PM. Concealed within the dusters was one and a half pounds of opium (worth more than 700 yuan). He was walking near Xiaoshadu Road and Connaught Road when Constable No. 632, an Indian officer, noticed his suspicious behavior. The constable apprehended him and found the opium in the dusters. He then took the man to the Hongkou police station and handed him over to the Special District Court. Police lawyer Qian Jiu prosecuted him according to the law. The defendant claimed that the bundle of dusters was given to him by a friend, Fang Zhengxiang, who lives at No. 152, Yidingpan Road and works on a certain ship. Fang asked him to take it to the home of a Wang family in a certain alley on Yuyuan Road near Jing'an Temple Road. Fang was following behind him at the time, but he escaped while he was being arrested. He asked for leniency. He was ordered to be remanded in custody. Yesterday, Judge Jiang Shuzi presided over the third criminal court and questioned him clearly. He sentenced Chai Zhini to five months in prison as a warning. The opium was confiscated.

### Coal Industry Association Hires Legal Counsel

Over 600 vendors in the Shanghai Coal Industry Association, through the efforts of executive committee members Zhang Delong, Shi Xingli, and others, and after appealing and negotiating with all parties, obtained hundreds of tons of low-priced coal at 18 yuan per ton. It has already been purchased and used by various members. They have now negotiated for another 600 tons, scheduled for a second round of low-price sales starting on March 25th, with each ton sold at a low price of 50 yuan. The members of the association attribute their success in obtaining such low-priced coal to the enthusiastic assistance of their permanent legal counsel, lawyers Yin Tinghua and Cai Guoxiang. Therefore, the members have jointly hired lawyers Yin and Cai as their permanent legal counsel in order to express their gratitude.

### Social Miscellany

Wei Hong, a local, 20 years old, who works at the Xiangkang Money Shop at No. 511 Sichuan Road, was leaving the Xingguang Cinema after watching a movie around 7 PM last night. When he reached the entrance of the New World entertainment complex on Yu Qiaqing Road, he boarded a Route 1 tram to return to the shop. When the tram arrived at the Paqiu Chang station, Hong stepped off slowly. A black-plated car, license plate number 4757, was speeding by and he was unable to avoid it in time. Wei was knocked to the ground, and the car wheel crushed his left leg bone. He was bleeding profusely. Constable No. 140 from the Central Police Station rushed over and sent Wei to the Tongren Hospital for treatment.

Ke Weisheng, a Hubei native and the principal of Huaiqing Elementary School at No. 20, Lane 1249, Avenue Edward VII, was detained by the Chengdu Road police station on the 19th of this month for embezzling 180 yuan in legal tender entrusted to him by student Liu Wenyu for safekeeping. Yesterday, he was sent to the second criminal court of the Special District Court, where he was publicly prosecuted on embezzlement charges. Judge Chuan presided over the hearing. The defendant confessed to the crime and requested an opportunity to find a way to repay the money. Judge Chuan, after considering the circumstances, announced that the case would be adjourned for seven days for further hearings.

Around 5 PM yesterday afternoon, near the northern boundary road of the Public Concession (i.e., the main entrance of the North Railway Station), a small truck No. 227, belonging to the British army and carrying several Scottish soldiers, was traveling west to east. A Jiangbei boy, about seven or eight years old, was playing on the road and did not manage to dodge in time. The car wheel ran over his head, shattering his skull and spilling his brains. He died instantly. The French police notified the Tongren Fu Yuan Tang to collect the body for burial after no family was found.

Ding Shaokun and Ren Wu, two robbers who specialize in committing robberies in the Jiaxing Road area, were apprehended by the Yulin Road police station at the end of last month.

Liao Fenggui, a 28-year-old from Jiangbei, was wandering around Binlang Road and Jiaozhou Road at 11:15 PM on the 20th of this month, planning to rob pedestrians. He was arrested by the Gordon Road police. Yesterday, he was sent to the Special District Court. Police lawyer Qian Xun requested detention. The court ordered further verification at a later date.

Yesterday morning around 6 AM, a male corpse was discovered near the bamboo fence of the Xuhui Middle School gate in Xujiahui. The corpse was about 50 years old, wearing a grey cotton-padded jacket, black cloth trousers, and tattered rubber shoes, resembling a coolie worker. He presumably died of illness. Since no family members were found, the French police notified the Tongren Fu Yuan Tang to collect the body for burial.

### Japanese Translator Shot on Lincoln Road Yesterday Morning; Seriously Wounded by Three Gunshots

Around 8:00 AM yesterday morning, a shooting occurred on Lincoln Road in western Shanghai, among the Jiangbei shanties. The victim was Luo Zhixiong, 37 years old, from Jiangbei, currently serving as a translator in the Japanese ranks in western Shanghai. Luo was walking through the area yesterday morning when four or five thugs jumped out from the side of the road and ordered him to stop. Knowing something was wrong, Luo immediately started running. The thugs pulled out Mauser pistols and fired more than ten shots at Luo, who was hit three times in the head, legs, and other areas. Luo fell to the ground in extreme pain, bleeding profusely and nearly losing consciousness. Seeing that their objective had been achieved, the thugs left. After "puppet police" arrived on the scene after hearing the news, they immediately sent Luo to a certain hospital for treatment. It is reported that his injuries are serious and his life is in critical condition.

### Words from a University Student

— Fang Xiaolan

Recently, there have been quite a few articles in newspaper supplements criticizing students. The arguments are impassioned, and the righteous indignation overflows from the page. However, after reading two or three articles, one gets tired of it. This is largely due to the similarity of views among these "heroes."

The main target is the university student. Although we don't have labels on our foreheads, I am indeed afraid of the looks people give me on the street. Because the writers have already judged us for life: "Living in a drunken stupor."

In fact, university students have been scolded for a long time. However, for a long, long time, only those who scold had the freedom to speak and write, while those who were scolded could only endure it. But, in today's era where everyone talks about democracy, we also ask for a little freedom.

First, I hope the writers will bear with us a little and be patient. Evaluating people and events requires maintaining a sense of calm; otherwise, what is revealed first is one's own ugly face.

Secondly, I ask the writers to distinguish between right and wrong and dig deeper. "One cannot generalize," is a very old saying, but scratching the surface will never touch the core of the problem.

Then, one would not be so sensitive as to immediately judge a male university student in a suit and leather shoes as an evil young master from a foreign concession, or say that a female university student with a perm is a dancer. Honestly, I am truly amazed at the highly developed nerves of people in this city.

Only by removing the glasses of prejudice can we broaden our horizons, from the individual to the whole. So, please don't be arbitrary; the facts are the fair judge. I do not deny the examples cited by the commentators, but I hope they will show mercy in their writing and not drag people down. Since you plan to have it printed in lead type and circulated, you must be more careful. Seeking only personal gratification can hardly be considered a virtue, right?

University students who work hard, strive to live a truly meaningful life, and cultivate themselves into a force are not as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. But in their struggle against a bad environment, upholding their beliefs, and striving for progress, they lack encouragement and sympathy.

Moreover, the focus of the problem seems to be on university education itself, not on the students. I think they are just people persecuted by an unsound system. This is something that few people like to discuss.

For example, the measures taken by some universities are simply incomprehensible. The enrollment examination is sloppy, the teaching is careless, but the final exam is treated as a major battle, strictly enforced, and ten or twenty students are expelled. This is called running a school seriously!

A sacred cause has fallen into the hands of businessmen, and venerable universities have become factories for manufacturing goods. How can one even talk about nurturing talent? Lectures, textbooks, and filling fifty minutes counts as one lesson. Is this all that university education is for?

If the fundamental problem is not solved, the absurd behavior of some university students cannot be eliminated. Because "education" has not told them how to be a person.

### Water and Life

— Bao Chuxiang

Water is the driving force behind a healthy human life.

From microorganisms under a microscope to humans, all need water to prolong their lives. Water is like air to humans; obtaining it means life, and not obtaining it means death.

The human body needs a large amount of water for excretion. Because water is an indispensable component of the tissues of all living organisms. If the normal amount of water is reduced by a significant amount, then all physical and chemical functions in the body will be greatly affected.

People sometimes have fevers, diarrhea, or vomiting, which can also be said to be the result of a decrease in the normal amount of water in the body.

Maintaining body temperature also requires a considerable amount of water for evaporation. Because the body loses a considerable amount of water when dissipating heat. The excretory products such as uric acid and urea produced by the assimilation of protein in the human body must be accompanied by a large amount of water intake for excretion, so that the cells in the body can smoothly carry out "metabolism."

We lose about one and a half pounds of water daily through respiration, and also a lot of water through sweat. When the water content in the body decreases, the secretion of digestive juices must decrease, and the digestive function must change its normal state. As a result, food cannot be fully digested and absorbed, leading to nutritional imbalance in the body, until the water is replenished, and the human body can return to a healthy state.

Water has a great impact on human health, so we must not ignore the way we drink water. I think everyone should not only have a considerable limit on the amount of water they drink every day, but also stipulate the time for drinking water. This way, you will not hinder your health due to drinking too much or too little water.

The best times to drink water are 6:00 AM, 10:00 AM, 2:00 PM, 5:00 PM, and 10:00 PM every day. You can drink one or two large glasses of boiled water each time. At least eight large glasses must be drunk in five times. This is enough to meet the normal water needs of the body.

Therefore, rationalized drinking of more water can make our bodies healthier day by day.

Essay

### How to Develop Personality?

— Yang Tongfang

Everyone has their own unique personality, which is acknowledged by psychologists and educators. Professor Edward of the United States once said: "Everyone has a lovely, beautiful, and touching personality; however, some have already been developed, and some are still hidden." Imagine how regrettable it would be if a person concealed his beautiful personality, so that he never had the opportunity to express the intellectual and spiritual qualities that are pleasing.

To fully develop one's personality requires not only considerable time, but also effort. Here are some ordinary principles for developing personality, written concisely below:

(1) To develop personality, never ignore the factors of heredity, environment, and proper social interaction; reading books and newspapers, increasing life experiences, and appreciating beautiful literature, art, and music are also related to developing personality.

(2) Cultivate a wide range of life interests and continuously improve your life ideals.

(3) Develop and improve aesthetic awareness, interact more with nature, and pursue the truth, goodness, and beauty of life.

(4) Develop normal emotions, seek psychological and physiological adaptation, and make life always in an atmosphere of harmony, happiness, satisfaction, and freedom. In this way, you can find the beauty of your personality unconsciously.

(5) At any time, try to improve your body shape, posture, appearance, tone, and wording, in order to obtain a healthy body, so that people discover that you have an elegant and friendly attitude, which is very helpful for the development of personality.

(6) Living bravely, perseveringly, resolutely, and proactively, and always having an optimistic attitude and ardent hope, are even more essential for developing personality.

### Orator—A Quick Sketch of Human Nature—

— Zi

The orator mentioned here can be the eloquent representative of the League of Nations, or the eloquent lawyer in court. He may never have participated in a debate or stood on a podium... He is a special personality that adorns every level of society, relying on two rows of clever teeth, dangling a three-inch incorruptible tongue, and possessing a strange temperament that is not subject to heaven, not subject to earth, and even less subject to people.

To put it nicely, he likes to argue; to put it bluntly, he is a petty and troublemaking nitpicker. He argues about things that are reasonable, and he argues about things that are unreasonable. It's best if someone argues with him; if there's no one, he will mumble to himself. From the vastness of the universe to the smallness of a fly, nothing cannot be his subject.

"No, no, I think your point is not quite right," this is his suave lament. "Although I haven't been abroad, I can infer that..." If you are narrow-minded for a moment or feel unconvinced, he is immediately ready to engage in close combat. He becomes more and more courageous as he fights, and the volume gets louder and louder. Eventually, the whole family is in turmoil, and his face turns red and purple, with purple veins wriggling like earthworms on his forehead... This is when everyone has no choice but to unanimously call him an orator. Finally, he slams the table with force: "In short, although I have never been abroad, I dare to conclude that such a strange thing would not happen abroad!" The "in short" in the orator's mouth is a serious warning. It would be bad if things didn't end here. If the host is smart, he should take this opportunity to tell everyone that dinner is ready and they can go eat.

Making something out of nothing is also one of the orator's abilities. "I thought your opinion on the issue we discussed yesterday was a bit unreasonable..." or "What do you think of what Lao Li just said?..." He will send a henchman to challenge after a while. So he is never worried about not having a topic; what he is worried about is not having an opponent.

Really, there are no opponents to orators in the world, so how could there be orators? People are all small-minded, so few people can withstand the orator's provocations. After a fierce argument between the two sides, the result is red faces and thick necks, and they part unhappily. Therefore, in a pile of fools, orators always have the opportunity to display their great talents. Conversely, in a crowd of smart people, orators are the most boring people. His words get no response, and when he himself feels that the entire space of the room is only filled with his own boring words, and no one else gives him a step down, he may have to withdraw his flags and drums and leave, to show off his abilities in a pile of fools.

In fact, what in the world is absolutely right and absolutely wrong? It's a matter of opinion, viewpoints differ, and right and wrong are self-evident. Why insist on one's own opinions, despise others, and even more, why force others to believe what you believe? Moreover, what effect can arguing have? No matter what the matter, the result of arguing is that both sides always think that their own views are more correct than before, and the other's views are more absurd than before. Why bother? For the sake of quibbling and making something out of nothing, people often disregard affection and friendship, tear apart other people's faces, and tear down their backstages. At present, they are fighting for a breath, but they only increase the jealousy in the other's heart. In the eyes of bystanders, this kind of person is more likely to reveal their true colors, exposing their most vulnerable personality, which is so unworthy!

Although there are more or less people like this in every level of society, we always think that such people are superfluous. The only way to deal with them is probably to "respect them from a distance."

### Hollywood Anecdotes

— Xin Ying

(1) Women's Chain Letter: Many chain letters have been invented in Hollywood, this movie city. Recently, a new type of chain letter has been discovered in the city, which is more interesting than the previous ones. It says: "Remove the top name from the list of names on the letter, then fill in your own name below and send it to five good friends. At the same time, wrap up your wife and send her to the person you crossed out. This way, when your name is at the top, you can get three thousand one hundred and twenty-five women." Since the discovery of this chain letter, it has become popular in the film city after a while, making the green men of Hollywood very busy.

(2) Tomorrow's Films: Hollywood films sometimes have the word "Tomorrow" in the title. Recently, we learned that there are many tomorrow films in production. Universal is filming a tomorrow film called "When Tomorrow Comes." MGM has two tomorrow films, one is "Tomorrow Never Comes," and the other is "Life Begins Tomorrow."

(3) The Queen's End: In a Hollywood film company, there is recently a female star who used to be honored with the title of queen, but is now forgotten. The director made her and a male star shoot a film. The male star spoke a lot when filming, but although she did not speak much, once she spoke, she damaged the entire work and had to reshoot. Finally, she said to the director: "There is probably a ghost at work here." The director said humorously, "I'm afraid one of the lice is very numerous among you female stars."

### Trends in the Old Capital's Theater Scene (Part 1)

— Wei Wei

The Death of Zhao Shengbi: Among the Sheng generation of the Fu Liancheng Opera School, Zhao Shengbi, a martial artist, and Sun Shengfu, a bearded actor, were the most highly regarded. At that time, the Sheng generation of the Fu Society performed at Guanghe Tower, always with Shengbi and Shengfu taking turns singing the main plays, and there were many people in the old capital who supported Shengbi and Shengfu. At that time, although the two had not yet graduated, their popularity was no less than that of ordinary famous actors. Now, Li Shengzao, Sun Shengfang, Gao Shenglin, Yang Shengchun, and others have become successful, but their fame at that time is difficult to compare with Shengbi and Shengfu. However, after the Sheng generation graduated and left the troupe, Li Shengzao, Sun Shengfang, Gao Shenglin, Yang Shengchun, and others rose one after another and became popular roles, while Shengbi and Shengfu failed to maintain their good reputation from their school days due to voice problems. Shengbi developed a fondness for vices and lust for women, which led to his inability to get ahead after graduation and his impoverished state. A few years ago, Li Wanchun was hired to come to Shanghai, and Shengbi came with him as a supporting actor. Although his skills had deteriorated a lot, his style still remained, and those who knew music could not help but regret it! We sincerely hoped that Shengbi could rise again and restore his former reputation. Unexpectedly, recent news came that Shengbi had become a beggar and froze to death at the gate of the Tianjin Chinese Theater. It is a pity and also pitiable that a talent who could have been made did not seek progress and ended up like this. How can actors not be careful about their private lives?

Li Zongying's Performance: Recently, three female actors of Kunqu opera, Meng Youdong, Li Zongying, and Zhang Wenjuan, went from Shanghai to Peking to perform. Among these three, Li Zongying's performance was the most appealing. Li first decided to perform at the Jixiang Theater on the second of the month. Li performed the complete "Lost Street Pavilion," with Hou Xirui playing Ma Su, Wang Quankui playing Sima Yi, Ha Baoshan playing Wang Ping, Ci Ruiquan playing the old soldier, and Song Jiting playing Zhao Yun. The cast can be said to be complete. In the front, there were also Ma Yanfen and Jiang Miaoxiang's "Yu Tang Chun," Yang Shengchun's "Picking the Halberd," and Lin Qiuwen's "Mu Kezhai." Li Zongying also invited Yang Baozhong to play the piano for her. The newspapers of Peking and Tianjin promoted Li extensively, so as soon as the poster came out, the tickets were sold out in advance. According to reports, Li is a famous socialite in Shanghai who has been learning opera from Chen Xiuhua for many years. With Li's willingness to work hard, her skills are said to be on par with those of Meng Xiaodong, the leader of Kunqu opera.

### Filming "Snow White" and "Robin Hood"

— Haixing

The Chinese film industry urgently needs new people, but it also needs to create a new path for scripts, otherwise, the future will become increasingly bleak, because the audience will feel bored, which is the same at home and abroad.

According to the reporter's investigation, there are two new types of dramas in planning, one is Xinhua's "Chinese Snow White," and the other is Yihua's "Chinese Robin Hood." This seems to be picking up people's teeth and may be despised, but these two dramas currently in planning may be viewed in another way.

"Chinese Snow White," is not a burlesque, but a work performed by real male and female students. The star Chen Juanjuan, who has been out of the spotlight for a long time, will play Snow White, while seven comedians such as Shan Hanlan, Yin Xiucen, Tang Jie, Zhang Zhizhi, and Hong Jingling will play seven roles such as "Dumb" and "Shy." The form is similar, but the content is more powerful satire and good guidance.

"Chinese Robin Hood" will have more differences with the Western Robin Hood. This film particularly emphasizes helping the weak and suppressing the strong, robbing the rich and helping the poor, and the King John character in the original work is replaced by a representative of justice. Robin Hood and the knights he leads are fighting for justice and protecting justice. In Chinese history, such heroes and good men are very common.

Someone asked: Why take these names? That's probably because the film title is easy to attract the audience. Merchants want to come up with various ways to make a good profit, which is not reprehensible, as long as they do not obliterate their conscience and go astray, that is what movie fans hope for.

### New Studio, New Theater

Recently, there have been two major events in the film industry: The first is the opening of the Guohua New Studio, which covers a vast area and has two studios. The appearance is very grand. A large number of workers are building it day and night. It will be completed in early June, and a grand opening ceremony will be held at that time. This is the first part of Guohua's plan to expand its production capacity. Tens of thousands of dollars have been invested, and it is planned to produce 24 films a year, which is indeed a happy event in the film industry.

The second is the construction of the Jindou Grand Theater, located at the intersection of Fuxu Road and Tongfu Road. It is a movie theater specializing in domestic films, supplied by Xinhua, Yihua, and Guohua. The founders are Zhang Shichuan, Zhang Shankun, and the Liu brothers. The interior and exterior of the theater are completely streamlined, and the sound, lighting, seating, and management are all modeled after new European and American theaters. The opening date is probably around the Mid-Autumn Festival this year. At that time, people in Shanghai will have another high-end entertainment venue.

### Curiosities from the Pot Studio

— Su Shaoqing

Xin Yanqiu, is the earliest female actor to learn Cheng Yanqiu's singing and acting, named Xin, but she is actually experienced. Her real name is Wang Yuhua. Yuhua is naturally beautiful, with elegant bones and clear spirit, and her temperament is gentle and quiet. Her beauty is a perfect representation of the noble ideal of old-fashioned Eastern women. Some say, if so, she is a Lin Daiyu-style beauty. I said, it's similar, but not entirely. Yuhua looks frail, but her fat and thin are moderate, her length is appropriate, and her eyes are slanted upwards, with a heroic spirit hidden in them, but she never reveals a crude attitude. To dress her up as a chivalrous woman like Hong Fu or Hong Xiao is extremely wonderful. Lin Daiyu can only cry, can she be a chivalrous woman? Now, based on the "Hong Fu Zhuan" I watched one night, let's discuss her singing and movements. I have seen Yuhua perform many times in the past, but I haven't seen her in recent years. I watched her perform "Wind and Dust Three Heroes" with Yu Zhenfei and Liu Yanting at the Gengxin Stage. Yuhua played Hong Fu Nu. The changes in her sleeves and footsteps showed the spirit of Cheng Yushuang. Others who learn from Cheng are too contrived and often show a morbid state. Yuhua masters the meaning and listens to nature, making people only feel good-looking, and forget the trace of her learning from Cheng. This is her unique realm. For all art matters, those who learn must reach this realm before they can learn well. If they fall into imitation, they will become strained and foolish. Her singing is also the same. The tunes are all learned from Cheng, but she does not try to imitate too closely. The joints of the singing are all Cheng's. The only regret is that Yuhua's voice was originally very clear and bright, but in recent years, she has suffered many misfortunes, both physically and mentally, so her voice is lower than before, which is a pity. I don't know when she will be able to recover. The sword dance is also slightly less exciting due to insufficient strength after illness (the drummer on the stage was a novice, and there were omissions, which is also a reason), but the whole thing is the end of the show. The sword dance is optional and not important. Zhenfei's appearance is also good, and his singing, acting, and stage steps have improved a lot compared to before. He is full of spirit and is determined to make progress and soar. Liu Yanting's Qiu Ran Gong should be more flamboyant. The Qiu Ran Zhuan in the Tang Dynasty notes is written vividly, and his scolding is no less than that of the overlord Xiang Yu. Since Yanting can play the overlord in "Farewell My Concubine," this play should also be played like an overlord to make it more colorful. There are two things that need to be improved in the meeting of the three heroes in the hotel. First, when Hong Fu combs her hair, she can use a very long wig and spread it out to comb it, which is in line with the phrase "hair long and trailing on the ground" in Qiu Ran Zhuan. Second, drinking and cutting the enemy's head with a knife to eat it, although a heroic act, is too cruel. It should not be shown in front of the audience, and should be deleted in the next performance. (Correction, in the Curiosities from the Pot Studio on the 19th, Filial Piety to Heaven was mistaken for Filial Righteousness.)
