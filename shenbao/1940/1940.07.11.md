Declaration Issued by the Conference

Chongqing. The Seventh Plenary Session Declaration of the Fifth Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang stated: The Seventh Plenary Session of the Fifth Central Executive Committee of this Party is held at the beginning of the fourth year of our sacred War of Resistance. Observing the drastic changes in the world situation and examining the great responsibility of China, we have thoroughly reviewed the work of resisting Japan and building the nation in the past six months, identified shortcomings, promoted improvements, and made separate resolutions for implementation. Now that the meeting has concluded, we will briefly state the close relationship between China's War of Resistance and world security, and the way in which this Party and our compatriots should work together to our compatriots throughout the country. First, China's War of Resistance today has become the most important force to guarantee international justice and peace. We must examine our responsibility to our ancestors and to mankind and adhere to the consistent national policy of fighting the Japanese to the end. Three years ago, at the beginning of the War of Resistance, we defined the significance of this operation as not only protecting the survival of the nation and the independence of the country, but also maintaining international justice and world peace. The center of stability in Asia must be our independent and free China, and the world can only have a secure foundation after Asia has true peace. Last February, the declaration of the Fifth Plenary Session of this Party listed the essence of the late Premier Sun Yat-Sen's teachings of thirty years ago, pointing out that "it is absolutely impossible for Japan to implement a policy of aggression in China," and that "if the powers truly cooperate and act in the common interest, those who want to wage war against China for the sake of the private interests of a nation will surely be eliminated." It was also pointed out that Japan's aggression against our country is the beginning of threatening the largest market between the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Now that the European war is in full swing and changes are still unfolding, Japan, after three years of war against China, still intends to exhaust its remaining strength and try its tricks in the Pacific. Without China's resolute War of Resistance, the turmoil in the Far East situation after the outbreak of the European war would be even more unimaginable. Japan already has unlimited ambitions in the Pacific. If it is not curbed in time, no country in the world will be able to preserve its rights and interests in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and there will be no room for it to stand. Today, Japan's ambition is not limited to a corner of East Asia, but it intends to implement its Tanaka Memorial, the so-called traditional policy of conquering the world by conquering China, which is already clear and undoubtedly. Countries around the world should recognize that Japan has become a public enemy of the world, and the close relationship between our country's War of Resistance and world peace. In the recent dramatic changes in the European situation, we deeply feel the great responsibility of stabilizing the Far East and rebuilding the world. We must do our best to be honest and friendly with friendly countries around the world, and work together to overcome the changes in the world, so as to help the brightness of tomorrow. This is what our entire country must recognize, and what friendly countries around the world should know. Second, the past three years of our War of Resistance have weakened Japan's strength day by day, and the foundation for victory has become stronger. We believe more firmly in the profoundness of the historical and cultural foundation of our nation and the greatness of the Three People's Principles. The spirit of invincibility of our Chinese nation has been shown to the world by facts. However, our goal of struggle is to guarantee the victory of the War of Resistance with the success of national construction. The task is arduous and the responsibility is great. We must make the nation's great power stronger as we fight. Therefore, in terms of war, the last struggle that the Japanese must do is in our estimation. We should know that in today's nation-building, those who rely on thicker foundations and better environments must make every effort to be hardworking in order to protect the foundation of the country forever. The late Premier Sun Yat-Sen's teaching that we take condensing the people's strength and strengthening national defense as the foundation of all national construction is proven to be an absolute truth. The difficult environment during the war is a good opportunity for us to catch up and realize the Three People's Principles. Therefore, today we should commemorate the sacrifices of the martyrs, cherish the achievements we have made, and recognize the arduousness of the responsibilities of those who die later. We should admit that our past hardships are insufficient and our efforts are insufficient. From now on, we must strengthen our struggles in politics, economy, and military affairs, and follow the guidance of the President of our Party in all matters.

Editorial

### The Reformation of the French Political System

Following the failure of the war and the change in foreign policy, France is also facing a turning point in its political system. According to recent news, the French parliament has passed a constitutional amendment with an absolute majority, granting General Pétain dictatorial privileges. The parliamentary system, which has always been the main pillar of French democracy, will also be reorganized to imitate the Italian corporatist system. From the previous Daladier cabinet to the Reynaud cabinet during the war, the French political system has gradually become more centralized. With the establishment of the Pétain cabinet, which did not follow the usual constitutional norms, people had a premonition that it would turn from democracy to dictatorship. The democratic regime of the French Third Republic, established after the defeat in the war against Germany in 1870, had been shining brightly for 70 years. Now, after another defeat in the war against Germany, it is transitioning to the realm of totalitarian politics. This is not only France's misfortune, but also the misfortune of world democracy.

France is an important source of modern democracy, but from another point of view, fascism can also find a suitable social basis in France. France is a country where industry and agriculture can balance each other. The rapid development of heavy industry only occurred after the last European war. The system of small farmers and small-scale industries is more developed than in any other country. As a result, small farmers, small industrialists, small employers, independent craftsmen, and people who rely on small dividends for a living occupy an absolute advantage in society. This so-called middle class is the lower-level foundation of the National Socialist Party and fascism in Germany and Italy. Under normal circumstances, these people in France value individual freedom and are unwilling to be subjected to strict government control and high taxation. Therefore, they have never hoped for a strong government, which is one of the reasons for the constant political instability in France in the past. However, once faced with political and economic crises, these people, in extreme distress, often become supporters of the fascist movement. Germany and Italy have both experienced this process before, and now France is following in their footsteps. As early as around 1934, France was once threatened by the fascist movement. Doumergue and others had even proposed amending the constitution. Fortunately, Barthou's diplomatic efforts achieved great success at the time, and the domestic political crisis was temporarily eliminated by the victory of the left-wing parties in the elections, which eased the threat. However, the division of domestic parties and the opposition of political views have always been France's own fatal wounds, and there has been no significant improvement even during the war. Now, after a disastrous defeat, the country is declining, and the wounds are all over the place. Totalitarian politics has become what the majority of the people demand. The glorious France of freedom seems no longer able to exist!

Now that France has in fact withdrawn from the international political arena, its reform of the political system should not have any serious impact on general international relations. As far as France itself is concerned, this move can only be regarded as an emergency measure, and whether it can solve France's current difficulties remains to be proven by future facts. First, the final stage of the European war is still continuing. If the war does not end, France's future national destiny and status cannot be determined. The previous armistice treaty was only to suit the needs of Germany and Italy to continue fighting against Britain. Regardless of who wins in the future, France will inevitably be subjected to a new rule, and the change in France's political system may not have a decisive impact on the future. Second, France's reform has not caused a good reaction in Germany and Italy. For example, Roman newspapers claimed that France should be placed under the strictest ruling, which would not change because of its political system reform. They also said that France's reform was too late and could not guarantee that France would benefit, which shows that they did not give any sympathetic encouragement to France's move. Third, fascist rule often relies on building external achievements to maintain its internal authority. Germany, Italy, and semi-fascist Japan are all like this. Today's France can only endure humiliation externally. Although it is currently supporting dictatorship because it is stimulated, how its authority can be maintained for a long time is a very difficult issue. Fourth, the French people have a natural love of freedom, and may not be able to transform to the opposite side simply because of the defeat in the war. In addition, the complexity of social classes and the contradictions of class interests, it is not known how the Pétain regime will have to operate in the future to coordinate them and form a pure force. Therefore, even if France's reform is successful, the future is still full of thorns.

From everything France has experienced recently, it can be proven that the so-called glorious peace cannot be enjoyed by defeated countries. As a first-class power, once it pays off the enemy, not only is the sovereignty of its territory not guaranteed, but even the excellent tradition of its own political system can no longer be maintained. This is truly the most tragic page in modern history! France's situation deserves the greatest sympathy, but at the same time, France's mistakes also give the world a severe lesson. The True Meaning of (Demilitarization), all party and government work, especially at all levels of administration, must be real, fast, neat, strict, honest, diligent, law-abiding, and dedicated to public service, so that there is no waste of time and no extravagance of people. Our review of all the phenomena of lack of closeness, lack of agility, lack of rationality, lack of realism, and lack of timeliness in the administrative levels of the Party, government, military, and schools is the biggest shortcoming during the war. From now on, we should thoroughly reflect and quickly correct it. All our party members and all public officials must painfully examine themselves, devote all their attention, and strive for the strict organization, adjustment of personnel, and improvement of work efficiency. Regarding the assessment of work, it must be strict and diligent. The issuance and implementation of orders must be truly thorough. The handling of work must avoid unnecessary twists and turns and cumbersomeness. In particular, everything must be considered for the military victory and the people's livelihood. Those who neglect and delay will be warned, and those who are procrastinating will be abandoned. Then, the military victory, the enrichment of the people's livelihood, the completion of construction, and the realization of the Three People's Principles will surely have a development that exceeds our expectations. It can be asserted that the above two major essentials are specially put forward by this meeting to inform the compatriots of the whole country and the comrades of the whole party. Other specific matters that should be implemented are seen in the various resolutions of the conference and the recent book告 announced by the President of our Party on the "July 7th" Memorial Day. All party members and our military and civilian compatriots and comrades should strictly follow and there is no need to repeat them. This meeting hopes that our compatriots, at this time of dramatic changes in the world situation and the approaching victory of the War of Resistance,

will deeply believe in the correctness and immutability of the revolutionary strategy set by our late Premier Sun Yat-Sen for China decades ago. We must know that the final success depends on the joint and consistent sacrifice and struggle of our people, which is extremely far-reaching. In the world, only sincerity cannot be erased and only justice cannot be broken. Only with one heart and one mind, self-reliance and strength, can we go to the mission of saving the country and saving the world, and have the ability to experience all major changes, overcome all difficulties, and be the greatest and strongest force. Therefore, we must be more determined and more courageous, use perseverance to face the shocking changes in the world, and use perseverance to seize the fleeting opportunities. The victory of the War of Resistance and the completion of the great cause of nation-building will surely make the national spirit of China and the brilliance of the Three People's Principles shine on the world and forever be the guiding light of human civilization. May our compatriots and comrades across the country have more confidence and actively rise up to achieve it. (10th dispatch)

Detailed Account of the Destruction of the French Battleship Richelieu

London: British First Lord of the Admiralty Alexander reported yesterday in the House of Commons on the destruction of the 35,000-ton French battleship "Richelieu" in Dakar, West Africa. He stated that it was initially attacked by motorboats dropping depth charges under the stern of the ship, followed by naval aircraft attacking with aerial torpedoes. Five explosions were heard in succession, followed by thick smoke rising from the ship. According to aerial reconnaissance, the ship was listing to the left, and the stern was sinking with much oil floating around the ship. Although all British aircraft encountered intense anti-aircraft fire, they all safely returned to base. At the time the armistice agreement was signed, France had eight capital ships, three of which are now under British control. Furthermore, one was sunk and one destroyed, while two new battlecruisers, one aground in the port of Oran and unable to operate for a long period, and the other escaping late and likely reaching Toulon, but having been hit by a torpedo and temporarily out of service. The eighth capital ship was the "Richelieu," the condition of which has been described above. Besides these eight ships, only the "Jean Bart," sister ship to the "Richelieu," remained, but it was temporarily unable to complete operational deployment. If this type of new and powerful capital fleet were to be handed over to the enemy, the entire balance of naval power would be altered, greatly to the disadvantage of Britain. This has now been eliminated by British action. Britain does not want to lose its naval power and wants to prevent enemy invasions from the sea. In answering questions from members of Parliament, the First Lord continued, stating that there are still some cruisers under the command of French authorities, which the British will monitor, but he asked the House not to inquire further into the details. As for the whereabouts of the "Jean Bart," it was not announced for strategic reasons. The British had presented several options to the captain of the "Richelieu," but the captain made no suggestions. The British government and naval personnel were deeply saddened that the event was unavoidable. The British fleet commander later sent a private letter to the French commander, expressing his regret for the necessary performance of a painful duty and hoping there would be no casualties. The British presented the French commander at Dakar with four options, from which to choose one: (A) The French ships should sail to British ports under British escort with a skeleton crew, with the British guaranteeing to return the French crew and ships to France immediately after the war ends. (B) The French ships should sail with a skeleton crew to French ports in India, where they could be disarmed or entrusted to American custody. (C) The French ships should be disarmed within twelve hours in the port of Dakar. (D) The French ships should be scuttled by the French authorities within a specified period after receiving the signal. (Reuters, 10th)

London: The "Daily News" reports that after hearing First Lord of the Admiralty Alexander's statement in the House of Commons regarding the recent achievements of the invincible Royal Navy, the House and the entire nation cannot help but feel a mixture of sadness and joy. The exciting story of this heroic struggle will undoubtedly ignite the flames of national glory in the hearts of any Englishman. However, upon considering the necessity of this stern and painful action taken by our Navy, and that those struck were not enemies but yesterday's friends and allies, one cannot help but feel disheartened. The officers and men of the British Navy must also feel regret for this unfortunate battle, as they were once comrades with the French naval officers and men, whom they respected. Now, they have suddenly turned against each other with force, which is tantamount to the right hand cutting off its own left hand. (Reuters, 10th)

British Disarmament of French Fleet Removes Concerns in the Eastern Mediterranean

Alexandria: Following the disarmament of the French fleet here, the British government has guaranteed to provide supplies and pay to the French sailors remaining here, and they will be repatriated to France at the end of the war. These conditions are expected to continue. According to a statement issued here yesterday, the previously feared situation in the Eastern Mediterranean has now been averted. We hope that the good relations we have here will continue as before. What we want is to ensure that Germany and Italy cannot possess French warships to use against Britain. Britain is still fighting to defeat Germany and Italy and to restore France. (Reuters, 10th)

Stockholm: The Swedish People's Party newspaper states that although Britain had offered reasonable terms for the surrender of the French fleet, the French government preferred to aid the Axis powers. Britain was forced to use force, which was not directed against France but against Germany. The British unanimously made this decision, and it is reported that influential figures in the United States also support this decision, as the United States understands that the outcome of the war is extremely important to the United States. (Reuters, 10th)

### British House of Commons Approves £1 Billion in War Expenditure; British Government's Wartime Spending is Enormous, Averaging £5.5 Million Per Day

London: Chancellor of the Exchequer Wood yesterday moved in the House of Commons to approve £1 billion in war expenditure, stating that the House had approved £700 million on March 13, of which £675 million had already been spent. In the past four weeks, the average daily expenditure directly related to the war has been over £5.5 million, mostly used for the army, navy, air force, supplies, and aircraft manufacturing. The remainder is used for shipping, food, and domestic security. This figure is clear evidence of Britain's determination to fight for victory. The doors of revenue and expenditure are now wide open, and contributions from war expenditure taxes will inevitably be extremely high and must be done quickly. On the one hand, we must pay attention to the necessity of sound finances, and on the other hand, prepare to make the necessary financial sacrifices. The House then unanimously approved the £1 billion appropriation, while ignoring the secret meeting in Germany on economic welfare issues. (Reuters, 10th)

London: The National Labor Council, at its meeting last night, strongly opposed the tax, arguing that it would impose an unfair burden on the poor. (Reuters, 10th)

Vichy: The French Foreign Ministry has issued an order stating that the French Chargé d'Affaires in Britain, Campenon, notified the British Foreign Office of his resignation on the 5th of this month without the government's consent, which is improper. He should be temporarily suspended from his duties to uphold discipline. (Havas, 9th)

Grenoble: According to reports from Vichy, the temporary capital of the French government, the final meeting of the French Parliament was held secretly in Vichy at 9:30 AM today. Chamber of Deputies Speaker Herriot declared to the Chamber yesterday that until France is free, we must adhere to strict discipline. France needs justice and fairness, but this is not the time to realize justice, but a time for the entire nation to engage in reflection, deliberation, and obedience to leadership. We must be cautious and not disturb Marshal Pétain's intentions. We must transform ourselves and rebuild France. The country we love is about to be reborn. According to Radio Toulouse, Noel has been appointed as the French chief representative, who will work with the German authorities to plan matters in the occupied areas of France. (United Press, 10th)

### Eastern Africa: Front Line Quiet; Egyptian Army Re-equipped; Provoking Malicious Rumors

Cairo: According to recent war reports, in the western desert, British forces continue to engage and successfully disrupt Italian columns attempting to transport supplies and water to the Capuzzo fort, putting the enemy in an increasingly difficult situation, especially with regard to mechanized transport. There is nothing else to report on other fronts. (Reuters, 10th)

Cairo: The Egyptian Ministry of Defense issued a statement saying that rumors that the British government has suggested disarming the Egyptian army and handing over its equipment to the British army is a malicious misrepresentation of suggestions still under consideration. The British government has suggested purchasing some of the equipment loaned to Egypt and exchanging it for newer equipment. This measure, when implemented, will also be temporary in nature and will only affect a portion of the Egyptian army, while benefiting the Allied forces fighting on the Egyptian border.

### US Senate Formally Passes the Nomination of Stimson as Secretary of War; Nomination of Navy Secretary Knox Also Expected to Pass; Roosevelt to Ask Congress to Allocate More Funds for National Defense

Washington: The Senate yesterday passed the nomination of Colonel Stimson as Secretary of War by a vote of 56 to 28. The vote followed two days of debate and was met with strong opposition from several isolationist senators. Several speakers urged the public to pay attention, saying that the policies advocated by Colonel Stimson could draw the United States into the vortex of war, and that his appointment would displease Latin American countries. Observers say that the two-to-one majority by which Stimson's nomination passed was effectively all that was needed to secure its approval. Executive Branch spokesmen said last night that the Senate is expected to pass Knox's nomination as Secretary of the Navy within the next few days. (United Press, 10th)

(Haitong Telegram, 10th)

New York: Acting Secretary of War Johnson said in a radio address today that we will never allow any European country to encroach on our shores.

Eurasian Monroe Doctrine Remarks: US President to Clarify Position

Washington: President Roosevelt's Secretary Early's remarks on Saturday that the Monroe Doctrine should be applied to Eurasia to establish an agreement to handle the land of defeated countries has caused bewilderment throughout the world, especially in Washington. Therefore, the President may encounter various questions when he meets with reporters today, as the scope of these remarks is particularly strange. Early relayed the gist of what President Roosevelt said that day to reporters at Hyde Park, thus publishing remarks on the Monroe Doctrine. As far as Washington knows, these remarks only make the very clear statements made a few days ago on the same issue unclear. Many here believe that the President's approval of these remarks is merely for domestic political purposes, but many political observers disagree, as they only cast a problem into obscurity and contradict the State Department's fairly clear policy. One thing is certain: President Roosevelt does not want to allow Japan to proceed unhindered in the Far East. However, Japan will certainly view these remarks as an interpretation that Japan can do as it pleases. According to general opinion, the disturbances caused by these remarks will lead President Roosevelt to clarify his position in the shortest possible time, but at present it can be said that no one in Washington knows how President Roosevelt interprets these remarks. (Reuters, 9th)

Tokyo: Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma recently told reporters that President Roosevelt's Monroe Doctrine statement at Hyde Park last week indicated a new interpretation of the Monroe Doctrine and its changes. Suma said that the attitude of President Roosevelt and US Secretary of State Hull on the Monroe Doctrine issue is sufficient to show that the United States has changed its original passive and defensive Monroe Doctrine to an active Monroe Doctrine. This fact is undeniable. In the past, the United States' actions were only to prevent European forces from expanding into the Western Hemisphere and defending the Americas from European aggression. Now, the United States seems to advocate that any changes in Western Hemisphere territory should be decided by countries within the Western Hemisphere. "If the attitude of the United States is as such, then it truly coincides with the concept recently advocated by Foreign Minister Arita. We now know that Secretary of State Hull is discussing the Monroe Doctrine, while President Roosevelt is talking about the Monroe Doctrine applying to all geographical regions. We feel a special interest in this interpretation." (United Press, 10th)

### President Roosevelt Does Not Refuse Nomination; Farley to Be Listed in Chicago Election

Washington – President Roosevelt did not answer questions from reporters yesterday regarding whether he would accept a nomination for a third term. Just hours earlier, Congressman Smathers stated after meeting with the President that Roosevelt was not a candidate for a third term, but that he could not refuse a nomination. (Reuters, 10th)

Chicago – After Postmaster General Farley arrived here to prepare for various campaign performances, it is widely believed that President Roosevelt intends to run for a third term. Supporters of this speculation offer the following three reasons: (1) According to a reliable source, Colonel Starling, head of White House secret operations, is preparing all supplies in case the President arrives in Chicago. (2) Federal Security Administrator McNutt, after meeting with President Roosevelt, told people that Roosevelt would not voluntarily run as a candidate but would be drawn in. (3) Illinois Democratic Representative Seyoues said after meeting with the President, "Roosevelt will be nominated and formally elected." (United Press, 10th)

Washington – Postmaster General Farley declared in Chicago last night that his name would be included on the list of Democratic presidential candidates at the Democratic National Convention to be held in Chicago next week. Some believe that Farley's move may imply that President Roosevelt is not preparing to serve a third term in the White House, due to the President's poor health or lack of energy to lead a vigorous re-election campaign. It is recalled here that the President informed Farley of his intentions in a letter from Hyde Park last week, instructing him to keep it secret. However, it is widely believed that if the President intended to run for re-election, Farley would not allow his name to be included on the campaign list. At the same time, Federal Security Administrator McNutt discussed this matter with the President in Washington. Afterwards, he indirectly revealed that he believed the President was quite interested in a third term. McNutt told people after meeting with the President, "I have long imagined the President's intentions." McNutt, former special envoy to the Philippines and also one of those hoping to participate in the presidential campaign, has declared that if the President decides to continue the campaign, he will withdraw. Someone asked McNutt whether the result of his conversation with the President had changed his previous observations of the President's intentions. McNutt simply replied, "No." McNutt is now prepared to withdraw from the campaign and urge the President to seek a third term. Therefore, his simple answer should be regarded as Roosevelt's intention to seek re-election. (United Press, 10th)

### German, Italian, and Hungarian Leaders Meet in Munich to Discuss Resolving the Romanian-Hungarian Dispute and Eliminating the Balkan Crisis

Berlin – Führer Hitler left Berlin last night, but authoritative sources said he did not leave German territory. It is widely believed that he is on his way to Munich to meet with the Hungarian Foreign Minister and Prime Minister. Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, who is currently visiting Germany and inspecting the German-occupied areas of France, Belgium, and the Netherlands, will also arrive in Munich for the meeting. (United Press, 10th)

Munich – Ciano arrived here at nine o'clock this morning. Ribbentrop welcomed him at the train station. An hour later, Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki, accompanied by Foreign Minister Csaky, arrived here from Budapest, along with several senior officials. Ribbentrop and Chief of Protocol Dornberg, along with several officials, went to welcome them. The Hungarian government had expressed its willingness to exchange views with the Berlin authorities some time ago. It is expected that changes in the situation in Southeastern Europe and the issue of border changes are the cause of this meeting. The meeting is expected to conclude in about a day, so the Hungarian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister may return home tonight or tomorrow morning. (Haitong News Agency, 10th)

Budapest – The news of the meeting of the leaders of Germany, Italy, and Hungary has reduced the tension here over the past ten days. Observers believe that the diplomatic activities of last week have produced some ways acceptable to both Hungary and Romania, sufficient to resolve the issue. This Munich conference may decide to transfer Romanian border lands to Hungary as a preliminary step to further negotiations. The conference may also take some form of arbitration by the Axis powers if direct negotiations between Hungary and Romania break down. (United Press, 10th)

Koo was ordered by the Chinese government to go to Lisbon for the Portuguese 700th anniversary of independence in the past two weeks. Rumors that Koo fled overseas are completely false. (Haitong News Agency, 10th)

Berlin – According to Haitong News Agency from reliable sources, the Chinese Ambassador to Belgium, Qian Tai, has left Brussels at the request of the German government, because the German government requires the ambassadors and ministers of various countries stationed in Belgium and the Netherlands to leave the occupied areas. Therefore, the Chinese Minister to the Netherlands, Jin Wensi, will also leave The Hague after Qian Tai and other ministers. However, the staff of the Chinese legation will remain in Belgium and the Netherlands to handle consular affairs. As for the Chinese legation in Norway, it will not be affected by the German occupation of Norway, because the Chinese minister to Norway is concurrently held by the minister to Sweden. (Haitong News Agency, 10th)

### Another Conflict on the Sino-Soviet Border

### Duke of Windsor Appointed Governor of the Bahamas; Tranquility in Martinique

London – It was officially announced here last night that the King has appointed the Duke of Windsor, former King Edward VIII, as Governor and Commander-in-Chief of the Bahamas. The Bahamas are located northeast of Cuba in Central America, with an area of 4,404 square miles and a population of 56,000. (United Press, 10th)

London – The British government has recently appointed the Duke of Windsor as Governor of the Bahamas in the British West Indies. This measure by the British government may allow the former King and his American wife to find a way to return to England and serve Britain during the German invasion. The Colonial Office issued the following appointment announcement: "We have appointed the Duke of Windsor as Governor and Commander-in-Chief of the Bahamas." When the news of the British Cabinet's appointment came, the Duke and his wife were in Lisbon, Portugal. It is expected that the Duke and his wife will soon go to the Bahamas, as the island is less than one hundred miles from the coast of Florida. It is rumored that the Duke may take a trans-Atlantic flight, via New York, to the capital of the Bahamas, Nassau. The Bahamas were the first land discovered by Columbus in the New World. The British government now needs a personality and talent like the Duke of Windsor, so Edward's appointment as a special envoy to the Western Hemisphere can be said to be just in time, as the Duke's personality and talent were fully revealed when he was the Prince of Wales. At the same time, London circles believe that this appointment proves that the rumors of a rift between the Duke of Windsor and King George are untrue. (International News Service, 10th)

Martinique – British ships have been patrolling the waters off the French island of Martinique since July 4, but so far there has been no attempt to intervene. This place may become a powder keg in the Western Hemisphere.

The situation here yesterday was extremely peaceful. (United Press, 10th)

New York – The New York Times mentioned today the captain of the French aircraft carrier Béarn, advising him not to allow France to suffer another futile tragedy.

(Reuters, 10th)

The Chinese and Soviet Ambassadors to Britain, Guo Taiqi and Maisky, were both present. Ambassador Guo expressed his pleasure at Maisky's attendance and said that the Soviet Union provides China with substantial assistance in its continued resistance without attaching any political conditions. When the Archbishop of Canterbury raised funds for the Aid China Society, he raised 36 pounds in five minutes. (Reuters, 10th)

London – Chinese Ambassador to Britain Guo Taiqi ridiculed last night the "Monroe Doctrine" announced by the Japanese government last month. Ambassador Guo declared at the "China Day" banquet, "Japan has not yet put its domestic order in order when it announced the construction of a new order in East Asia." If Japan's actions in China over the past three years are called "new order," then no country, no people can accept this statement, obey this statement, and agree with it, unless they want to restore jungle rule and slave life." When commenting on Tokyo's request for Britain to block the Yunnan-Burma Road, the Ambassador declared, "The Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and India are all interested in maintaining traffic on this road. Ambassador Guo welcomed Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky's participation in the "China Day" banquet. (United Press, 10th)

### A Review of the French Navy

The French navy originally ranked second in Europe. Since the beginning of navigation and the advent of armored steamships, French naval designers have often made more new inventions than other countries, but other countries have developed these original ideas to a greater extent than the French.

French politics and society have never been able to keep pace with technological and scientific progress. Although the country's shipbuilding department has undergone many changes, its fleet has been able to maintain its strength and could protect its lines of communication, second only to the British Empire, in times of war.

Although the French fleet was strong, the construction of warships and merchant ships in recent years has slowed down due to the People's Front government's adoption of a 40-hour work week. France suffered a great loss from the implementation of this system, especially in shipbuilding. However, since the 40-hour work week was officially abolished in the autumn of 1938, France has had many opportunities to make up for lost time in preparing for war.

Last year, the French shipbuilding industry was able to accelerate its progress. French shipyards were actively building no fewer than 126 warships, including four 35,000-ton battleships. The first Richelien was recently completed. The battleships Dunkerque and Strasbourg, which were built a few years ago, are known for their strong armor. The armor of the Dunkerque accounted for 40% of its displacement, which is unmatched by any battleship.

This class of battleship has a displacement of 26,500 tons and its important military equipment includes eight 13-inch guns and sixteen 5.1-inch dual-purpose guns. The turrets of the Dunkerque and its sister ship were designed and built in imitation of the British ship Nelson, with the turrets scattered around. The speed exceeds 30 nautical miles per hour. The Parsons geared turbine propulsion engine installed on the Dunkerque had a trial speed of more than 31.5 nautical miles, and its maximum speed may be above 32 nautical miles. The Dunkerque and Strasbourg are classified as battle cruisers, but their military equipment, speed, and exceptionally thick armor deserve to be classified as battleships.

France has large docks available for building giant ships. The Dunkerque was built in the Brest dry dock. The hull is about 690 feet long above the waterline, which is longer than the dry dock, so the hull was built out of the dock and then towed into the Ninon dock, where the separately built bow was installed. The new battleships Richelieu and Jean Bart were also built in dry docks.

The armor of the Richelieu-class battleships weighs about 15,000 tons, which is even thicker than the armor of the Dunkerque-class ships. The speed is also above 30 nautical miles per hour, or it can travel to 32 to 33 nautical miles. Its main military equipment will be the same as the British Monarch-class ships, that is, eight 15-inch guns. The secondary military equipment includes fifteen 6-inch guns, five turrets, eight 37mm anti-aircraft guns, and ten 13mm anti-aircraft guns.

France does not pay attention to aircraft carriers, but advocates that each ship should carry its own aircraft as far as possible, and the same is true for submarines. Richelieu-class battleships can each carry four aircraft. However, several aircraft carriers with a displacement of about 18,000 tons were under construction before the war, and their speed was very high. The largest aircraft carrier in the French fleet, the Béarn, is very effective, but not beautiful, with its smokestack and superstructure on the starboard side.

There are several particularly excellent warships in the French cruiser fleet, the most famous of which is the Suffren-class heavy ocean-going ship, equipped with eight 8-inch guns and a large number of secondary weapons. The armor is also very strong and the protection is comprehensive. The speed of this class of warship is at least 44 nautical miles per hour and the displacement is about 10,000 tons. French cruisers often carry two or three aircraft.

French destroyer design has also made great progress. For example, the Mogador-class destroyer has a displacement of about 3,000 tons and is equipped with eight 5.5-inch guns. This type of destroyer could originally be classified as a cruiser. This type of destroyer and several other classes of destroyers are larger than the British Navy's largest "L"-class destroyer. France also has a large fleet of escort ships, and many escort ships are under construction.

The French navy has the most submarines. In some respects, these submarines are the best in the world. The submarine Surcouf, which has made great contributions in this European war, is the largest submarine in the world, with a displacement of 2,880 tons when surfaced. It is 361 feet long and has a crew of 150. The Surcouf is actually a submersible cruiser, and its military equipment includes two 8-inch guns, two 37mm anti-aircraft guns, and ten 21.7-inch torpedo tubes. It can carry 22 torpedoes and one small seaplane.

Concentration of the French Fleet

### Demand for Foreign Currencies Leads to Price Increases: Yesterday's foreign currency market saw British and American gold pounds initially fall before rising, ultimately increasing by one and a half yuan each along with the price of gold. British gold notes were in slight demand, leading to a slight price increase. American dollar notes fluctuated significantly before eventually rising by two jiao. Hong Kong dollars, Canadian dollars, and Philippine dollars were all in demand, causing prices to rise uniformly. Japanese gold notes and Korean dollars were both in demand, with prices consistently trending upward. The former was priced at one yuan, one jiao, and seven fen, while the latter was at nine jiao and eight and a half fen. Securities and Rubber Stocks Suddenly Strengthened: The over-the-counter securities market was slightly sluggish yesterday, with many parties still observing. Scattered spot goods gradually appeared, and selling pressure in the market was relatively strong. Among various bonds, only the Wu type remained strong because, according to superficial calculations, the Wu type was cheaper and more cost-effective for long positions. Therefore, it was being bought at 41. All other bonds were weak, except for the Wu type, which was relatively strong. Yesterday morning, Hongda and Dafeng sold 100,000 to 200,000, which was offset by Renchang, Datong, Jiufeng, and Runli. The market was slightly weak. In the afternoon, Hongda continued to sell, Renchang switched from buying to selling, and Hengfu also sold. The Wu type was bought more at 41. Lianhe recovered the Bing type. The market was mostly stable, and sellers of the Wu type were rare, so its price was uniquely strong. As a result, except for the Wu type, which improved by one jiao and a half, the rest continued to fall by five fen to one jiao and a half. The total transaction volume was approximately 500,000 yuan. A concise table is listed below. Stock trading saw 50 shares of Dasheng Third Factory stock change hands at a price of 31 yuan.

### Yesterday, the public industry stock market opened, and rubber stocks were exceptionally strong. Shares of various Java rubber tree companies were particularly heavily traded, indicating a strong upward trend. It is difficult to explain the reason for this, but it is probably due to reports that Hong Kong recently moved a large sum of cash to Shanghai for investment. Other factors include the good dividend prospects of various companies. Industrial stocks also reacted, with Jardine Matheson shares being particularly prominent. They opened at 29 yuan and immediately soared, closing with buy orders at 31.5 yuan and sell orders at 32 yuan. Food: Imported Rice Prices Depreciate; Futures Rebound: Yesterday was the first day of the Rice Market Evaluation Committee's price evaluation. From the 10th to the 12th, the highest marked prices for various types of imported rice were 63.5 yuan for No. 1 Saigon and Siam rice (fire-milled 63 yuan), 61.5 yuan for No. 2 Saigon and Siam rice, 59 yuan for high-quality Tokyo Ine rice, 53.5 yuan for rice beans, and 49 yuan for mixed broken rice. According to statistics, high-quality rice was devalued by 2.5 yuan compared to previous prices, while lower-quality broken rice had a devaluation of 4 yuan. At the same time, both the Public Works Departments advised rice industry groups to order 100,000 bags of imported rice to replenish their reserves. Because the market clearly knew that there was no hope of a rebound, few people were buying, and those holding goods were eager to sell, the prices of various types of imported rice continued to decline. As a result, closing prices fell by another yuan compared to the previous market. For example, No. 1 aged Saigon paper was priced at 62.2 yuan and 62 yuan, No. 2 was at 60.08 yuan and 60.05 yuan, No. 1 Siam Wei was at 62 yuan, No. 2 special grade was at 60.05 yuan, secondary grade was at 60 yuan, fire-milled was at 61.5 yuan and 61.2 yuan, small pointed rice was at 60 yuan and 59.8 yuan, Tokyo Ine pointed rice was at 56.5 yuan and 54.5 yuan, rice tea was at 51 yuan and 50 yuan, and mixed broken special grade was at 47.7 yuan, while secondary grades were priced in boxes at 42.2 yuan. Although glutinous rice was stronger than other goods, it was still somewhat constrained by the overall weakness of imported rice. Therefore, the prices of various grades also declined by about a yuan. Special grade Jin was priced at 69 yuan, regular Dan Bai Yuan was at 67-68 yuan, and Hong Kong Bai Yuan was at 69 yuan. Nearly a thousand bags of thick and thin japonica rice continued to arrive. It was rumored that over-the-counter trading was sluggish, leading to prices of 71-72 yuan for regular and special grade Qing japonica rice, 70 yuan for market japonica rice, 70 yuan for Su Kun Changzhou white japonica rice, 68 yuan for secondary grade Su japonica rice, 70 yuan for Qing Si thin rice, and 68-69 yuan for Nangang early rice, with secondary grade Su rice at 66-67 yuan, a decline of one to two yuan.

### Yesterday, the spot market for imported rice was weak due to sluggish sales, but futures rebounded. This was mainly because prices had fallen too much the previous day, and sentiment gradually turned bullish. In addition, there were many re-export routes for these goods, and some of the previously arrived goods had already been re-exported to Shantou, Xiamen, and other places. Short positions were also actively covering, so buying sentiment was exceptionally good, and prices rose sharply by more than a yuan across the board. The price of Siam No. 2 rice for immediate delivery by Yinghua Company was 72 to 72.5 yuan. Rice loaded on June 20th was 70 to 70.08 yuan, and rice loaded on June 26th was 70 to 70.05 yuan. The total transaction volume was over 1,000 tons. Flour Market Calm; Fufeng Factory Reduces Supply by Half; Wheat Still Difficult to Enter the Concession: Yesterday, the flour market was particularly calm. On the Chinese factory side, Fuxin Factory had not yet resumed operations, and Fufeng Factory had also reduced its supply by half due to a lack of raw materials. Therefore, Chinese factories only released about 3,000 bags. The price for the old "Che Pai" brand was still 15.2 yuan. Those who needed more from the original customers had to rely on recycled goods. It was heard that the price for single old "Che Pai" flour was 17 yuan to 16.9 yuan, and hoarders slightly released their stocks. Japanese factories and domestic miscellaneous brands of flour continued to supply, but buyers were more cautious due to the small rebound in rice prices and the dumping of foreign flour and wheat. Therefore, transactions were calm. Brands such as Johnson & Johnson and Jinshan were priced at 16.3-16.4 yuan, with transactions of no more than 3,000-4,000 bags. The new wheat market was also calm yesterday. Although batches were being transported to Hongkou, they were all being taken over by Japanese factories. It was very difficult to transport them into the concession. However, the market was not as strong as it had been in the previous two days due to lower reported prices and a sluggish flour market. In addition to goods stored in warehouses waiting for higher prices, the purchase prices of Japanese factories had been slightly reduced by four to five jiao.

### The Yarn and Flower Factories Did Not Release Yarn Prices; Prices Increased: The yarn market continued to be good, with an upward trend. This was due to active demand from Hong Kong, which had a strong appetite for 10-count coarse yarn and 20-30 count fine yarn. Sales of 20-count yarn were slightly narrower. With such good real sales support, sentiment naturally improved, and the market gradually advanced. The price of 20-count Shuangma Factory single yarn reached 967 yuan, an increase of 167 yuan compared to the price at the time of the Lu wind, and 200 yuan higher than the price of 20-count Japanese yarn. The opening of the spot yarn market in the morning was still mediocre. The price of 20-count Shuangma was 935 yuan, and the price at the outer warehouse was 930 yuan. This price hovered between 38-39 yuan for a long time, and a major player did not come to sell on behalf of the factory. At the same time, demand from South China came one after another, and sentiment in the market suddenly intensified, with shouts of buying becoming more frequent. The market gradually opened higher, closing at 962 yuan. According to statistics, 2,325 bales were traded in half a day. The price of Shuangma rose by 32 yuan. Shenxin Factory opened 200 bales of 10-count Hongshuangma at a price of 605 yuan, and 200 bales of 10-count Deli at a price of 500 yuan. The amount of yarn bought by each sector is as follows: Hong Kong: 985; Fellow traders: 1,190; Ningbo: 70; Mainland: 80; Total: 2,325. Foreign Cotton Orders Arrived in Shanghai One After Another: The spot cotton situation slightly improved, but the appetite of Chinese factories remained weak. Fellow traders had sufficient goods, so actual transactions were occasional and in small quantities. The cotton that various parties had ordered from overseas in the past was recently arriving in Shanghai one after another. Households with urgent silver needs were willing to sell at reduced prices. The market was under pressure from this and was difficult to rise. However, Japanese factories were more active, but payments were still being delayed. Tongzhou cotton was traded at 156 yuan for 200 bales. American cotton was traded at 210 yuan for 100 bales by Japanese merchants. Indian cotton was traded at 190 yuan for 100 bales. According to other reports, the foreign cotton market in New York was weak due to a lack of major buyers. Later, due to selling by Southern parties and closing of positions by bullish traders, as well as some spot merchants selling near-term contracts and buying far-term contracts, closing prices fell nearly 30 points for near-term contracts and 7-8 points for far-term contracts. Indian cotton, including forecasts, rose 3 rupees. Although foreign cotton trading in Shanghai was not lively, it was still considered active. In addition, the yarn price gradually turned around, so the thinking of fellow traders was quite firm. It was heard that American cotton had been traded at a price of 260 yuan. The market inventory was not abundant. If a large number of transactions were made in the future, the cotton price would definitely rise sharply, because the transportation of Indian cotton was difficult and the price of American cotton was too expensive.

### Piece Goods: Autumn Sales to Customers Begin; Factories Halt or Reduce Production; Sales Gradually Recover: National Cloth: Yesterday, autumn sales to customers continued to develop, and market sentiment recovered. Hoarders resumed activity, and factories either halted or reduced production, leading to a sharp reduction in output. Therefore, they were no longer in a hurry to sell off their inventory. The supply in the market was slightly scarce, and prices gradually increased. White cloth, fine cloth, twill, and coarse cloth each increased by about five jiao per piece, with some scarce grades increasing by more than one yuan. Bleached and dyed cloth was affected by the sharp increase in the price of gray cloth, increasing by five jiao to one yuan per piece. Local streets and Zhejiang Dong Wen Yong gangs still had strong demand. Gray cloth, colored cloth, colored twill, coarse cloth, fine twill, and Lun Chang finished goods were traded up to 800 pieces, and hoarders searched for more than 300 pieces. Dong Cloth: Continued to rise. 12-pound Longtou fine cloth rose from 28.6 yuan to 29 yuan per piece. The future sales price of Sijunzi serge opened at 8 jiao, 5 fen, and 7 li. Fellow traders were optimistic about the market, and purchases and hoarding by outside retail investors gradually increased. Market sentiment turned firm. Exports: Cotton cloth with 550 pieces were transported to Ningbo today. Silk and Tea; Silk Prices Plummet; Narrow Sales Channels: Yesterday, the silk market was consistently calm, but the trend was slightly weak. Yokohama spot prices fell by 5 yuan, and forward prices fell by 12 yuan. New York near-term prices fell by 2.5 fen, and forward prices fell by 4 fen. Sales of silk by foreign firms were lifeless. The price of Baotou Foreign Firm Jili special silk opened at 5 twists, down 110 yuan from the beginning of the month. There were conflicting rumors about the arrival of raw silk in Shanghai. Regarding the extraction of a 12% special tax, it was heard that it would be implemented today, but there was no confirmation. However, there was no doubt that the freedom of raw silk operation would become increasingly narrow. Feng Mei Pearl Tea: Active US Sales: Transactions of green tea by foreign firms in this city had almost completely stopped since the interruption of navigation in the Mediterranean. In the past two days, American firms repeatedly sent telegrams promoting Feng Mei pearl tea and other goods. Yesterday, firms such as Jinlong and Tongfu purchased more than 100 boxes. The selling price of Feng Mei ranged from 280 yuan to 300 yuan, and the selling price of pearl tea ranged from 300 yuan to 330 yuan. Ordinary Zhen Mei, which was related to sales in Morocco, was still not being asked about.

### Sugar Market: Raw White Sugar Hovers and Falls Slightly Again: Yesterday, the sugar market softened due to more selling than buying. The association's marked price for spot raw white sugar was 67.7 yuan for the main warehouse and 67.3 yuan to 67.5 yuan for the outer warehouse, a decrease of a few jiao and half a yuan. The price of Taikoo car white sugar did not fluctuate much, with B grade at 77.5 yuan, HX grade at 75.5 yuan, Dutch red sugar still at 57.5 yuan, local factory snowflake sugar at 68 yuan, No. 1 ice sugar at 90 yuan, and Jingming ice sugar at 91.5 yuan, all down by a few jiao. Guangdong firms opened more than 400 packages of Dongxiang red sugar at 51.5 yuan to 52 yuan. Oilcake: Soybean Cake Unable to Support Prices: Soybean cake trading was originally expected to be weak during this summer season, but recently it has been affected by the persistent drought, leading to a gradual decrease in sales. Although various parties intended to support prices, the overall trend was mediocre, and the strength of price fluctuations was weak. Therefore, the market fell again yesterday. Only Xinghua, Shantou, and the mainland reluctantly traded 2,000 pieces of Dayouyusipai cake at a price of 13.3-13.4 yuan, 2,000 pieces of Shenji cake at a price of 12.4 yuan to 12.2 yuan, and one cart of Feizi cake. North-South Goods: Summer Vegetarian Dishes Mostly Rise in Price: Seasonal ingredients for summer dishes occupy an important position among North-South goods. Items such as preserved mustard stems were all stable. Only more than 300 jars of Sichuan preserved mustard stems were transported from Yong. Yesterday, Fuling goods were sold at 185 yuan, while ordinary spiced vegetables were at 45-46 yuan, with higher-quality ones at 54-55 yuan. Beijing winter bamboo shoots were at 44 yuan to 42 yuan. Newly arrived Xinchun Mao was not abundant, with high-quality goods at 80 yuan and secondary goods at 73-74 yuan to 65-66 yuan. Black Melon Seeds Rebounded: Black melon seeds recently tightened due to gradually thinning market inventories and the arrival of numbered goods. Yesterday, Ji Kui seeds were priced at 85 yuan, Ji Zhong seeds at 82 yuan, Xu Kui seeds at 80 yuan, Ming Guang seeds at 75 yuan, Dalian seeds at 65 yuan, and Jiao seeds at 180 yuan. Seafood: Yantai Shrimp Tails Slackened, Falling 30 Yuan Compared to Previous Prices: After the successive selling of Yantai shrimp tails from domestic production, the trend was still stable. However, the source of arrival was scarce, and sales turned few, resulting in a slackening of market prices. Currently, Longxudao tails are selling for 293 yuan, and secondary grades are selling for 275 yuan, a drop of about 30 yuan compared to previous prices.

### Coal: Sea Defense Blockade Does Not Hinder Foreign Coal Sources: The foreign coal market initially increased prices repeatedly, citing tight shillings and increased costs. Then, with the European war intensifying and exchange rates easing, coal merchants again refused to cut prices, citing soaring transportation costs. Until recently, the above-mentioned reasons seemed like fleeting clouds and smoke, and the rumor of a "sea defense blockade" again stirred up public opinion. Those holding goods feared that the blockade would cause a shortage of incoming goods, and that their stockpiles would become "rare goods to be hoarded" with tenfold profits. Consumers (such as factory users) insisted that even if it became a reality, it would only be like the blockade line at the Ningbo Zhenhai port, a purely military defense that should not "refrain from eating for fear of choking" and hinder export trade. Everyone spread rumors based on their own interests, and there was no consensus. The market, which had been calm for many days, again experienced a great disturbance. The foreign coal coming from the sea defense area included Hongji white coal, small blocks, medium blocks, coal powder (i.e., raw materials for coal balls), and Tong Deli No. 1, 2, and 3 blocks (i.e., Haifeng white coal), etc., which were smokeless white coal used to replace the domestic Henan and Shanxi white coal that had been cut off. Monthly sales were 30,000 to 50,000 tons, and the sales channels were very broad. After the blockade news spread, not only did local shops compete to absorb the goods, but also outside users, hearing the news, bought and stored large quantities to prevent any emergencies. As a result, market sentiment surged, and trading was exceptionally strong. Fellow traders and retail investors raised prices by more than 10 yuan in both open and black markets. Coal balls also increased in price accordingly. This was a case of "fishing in troubled waters." However, the results were very different. Not only did the blockade not occur for a long time, but the sources of incoming goods were continuous and successively on the way. Moreover, the exchange rate gradually eased, and market prices fell day by day. Not only did shopkeepers lose a lot of capital, but also users who hoarded goods suffered small losses and were inexplicably implicated. It was truly a case of "there is nothing wrong under the heavens, but fools trouble themselves." As for bituminous coal, the sources were even broader. Foreign goods included Indian Calcutta bituminous coal, Borneo coal, and Sijia Ding coal. Domestic goods included Kailuan coal and Dashan coal, with more than a dozen varieties. The sea defense blockade was like "wind and cattle and horses that are unrelated" and did not hinder the source. Moreover, this city still had a reserve of more than 270,000 tons, which was sufficient to supply for three months. Moreover, new goods were arriving continuously. Even with Indian coal alone, the goods arriving this month reached more than 70,000 tons, which could be used to estimate the rest. Therefore, there was no need to "worry about the sky falling" in the shortest period and panic before it broke. Sijia Ding Coal Increases in Price: The market for bituminous coal remains sluggish. The good thing is that the source is abundant, and the sales market is falling. Street customers are watching and waiting, and market prices are gradually falling. Only Japanese coal has rebounded by 20% due to recent price increases. Yesterday, a certain foreign firm made Sijia Ding bituminous coal, and the price for fellow traders was 170 yuan per ton for coal and 130 yuan per ton for coal powder, but the transactions were few and no one was interested.

### Medicinal Materials: The Production Price of New Lily Bulbs Doubles: The market inventory of aged lily bulbs is scarce. Regarding the production news, although the new goods this year have already entered the market, the production volume has been greatly reduced due to drought. If dried from fresh goods, labor costs have increased sharply, and the cost is also high. Therefore, the marked price is actually twice as high as last year. It is heard that the first batch of goods has already been shipped and will arrive in Shanghai soon. Betel Nut Clouds Road Turns Light: Hainan betel nut is constantly being shipped to Shanghai, so the accumulated stock is increasing day by day. Recently, the transport in northern regions encounters obstacles, causing the gang of customers to wait and see, and sales slump. Therefore, the momentum has turned tired, and the sales price in the later market will decrease by 1 to 2 yuan. Metals: British Steel Sheet Actual Sales Are Not Smooth: The British steel sheet market has been quiet for a long time. The good thing is that the intention of Tianjin gangs to enter has suddenly decreased, and the shipyards and machinery factories in this street have been stagnant, causing a major blow to actual sales. According to the past two days in the market, fellow traders have opened less, and sentiment has turned soft, with market prices rebounding by 3 to 4 yuan. Currently, the market price for two and a half li is 85 yuan per municipal dan, 65 yuan for five li, 60 yuan for seven and a half li, and the market price for one fen is also around 6 yuan. The price for one and a half li and two fen is 58 yuan, the price for two and a half fen and three fen is 57 yuan, and the price for four fen per municipal dan is also about 58 yuan. Statistics: Changes in Special Prices - May - Hui (5) (36) Electric Light Bulbs: Le Pao is sold for 67 yuan per 100 bulbs, Changsi Pao is sold for 65 yuan (Aboer Factory), ordinary Coca-Cola Pao is sold for 7.5 jiao per bulb, 40 watts is sold for 8 jiao per bulb, 60 watts is sold for 9 jiao, Die Huang Argon bulb 60 watts is sold for 9 jiao and 5 fen, 75 watts is sold for 1 yuan and 2 jiao, 100 watts is sold for 1 yuan and 5 jiao (Huade Factory), De Erke Coca-Cola bulb is sold for 4 jiao and 5 fen (De Erke Factory, the price has increased by 4 jiao per 100 bulbs) (Tianguang Factory), ordinary Coca-Cola bulb is sold for 8 jiao and 5 fen per bulb, 40 watts Argon bulb is sold for 9 jiao, 60 watts is sold for 1 yuan, 75 watts is sold for 1 yuan and 3 jiao, more Yuyu (Zhonghe Company) The price has increased by 5 yuan per 100 bulbs (Global) The other factories that have increased prices include Da Zhonghua, You Lian Xie Ji, Bo An, Yongming, Kaiming, and Da Guangming (6 factories) (37) The price of color printing has increased by 60% of the original price (Color Printing Industry Association) (38) The wholesale price of crayons has increased by 3 yuan per dozen (Xinhua News Agency)

The Japanese Military Police Officer Detained; The Situation Does Not Appear to Be Escalating; Japan Protests, Claiming Military Police Officer Was Abused; The US Authorities Have Not Yet Given a Formal Reply: Regarding the incident on the 7/7 Anti-Japanese Construction Memorial Day, where the US military detained Japanese plainclothes military police, Colonel Baker of the US military had already released the details of the incident the day before. Washington, D.C., the US Secretary of State has stated that the local officials will resolve it in a way that is appropriate to the situation and reasonable. The US side clearly believes that the incident has ended. However, the Japanese side denied this yesterday morning, believing that the resolution of this case is still far off. The details are listed below: Hull Hopes to Resolve the Issue Locally: Washington, D.C., July 10th, United Press International: Secretary of State Hull told the press yesterday that he hopes that the incident between the US Navy and the Japanese military police in Shanghai last Sunday can be dealt with in a "reasonable and cautious manner," as has been the attitude of the officials in Shanghai in the past. He said that he hopes that this matter can be resolved peacefully and locally. Hull said that the US officials in Shanghai have not yet provided a full report, so Washington will not make any statement. American Newspapers Pay Close Attention: He said that the Japanese government has not yet filed a protest with the US. Yesterday, Japanese extremists in Shanghai launched an anti-American movement. Hull did not comment on this, but American newspapers paid considerable attention to the re-emergence of the incident last Sunday. The Japanese side had originally announced that the matter was over. News of the anti-American movement that occurred yesterday in Hongkou, Shanghai, was disclosed on the front page of national newspapers. Japanese Ambassador to Washington Kenkichi Horinouchi said that he believes that the arrest of the Japanese military police in Shanghai by the US Navy was a "local incident" and should be resolved locally.

### Miura Admits to Expressing Apology: Last night, a Japanese naval spokesman declared at a press conference at the Broadway Building in Hongkou that Japanese Navy Commander Takada regarded the arrest of the Japanese military police on "7/7" as an indescribable barbaric act. It is said that Commander Takada is paying close attention to the development of this case. The Japanese military spokesman declared that the statement issued by the US Navy's 4th Regiment on the 9th was "incorrect." The Japanese military authorities were not protesting the arrest of the Japanese military police, but protesting the abuse they suffered. The Japanese authorities have not yet received a formal response after filing a protest. The spokesman solemnly stated that Japanese military police Commander Miura did not apologize when he visited Colonel Baker on Sunday afternoon. He only expressed regret that he did not notify him in advance of the actions of the Japanese military police. The Japanese military authorities believe that the actions of the US Navy's 4th Regiment have abandoned their responsibility as a member of the joint defense force and can be seen as evidence that the soldiers of the regiment cannot be regarded as a well-disciplined army. The spokesman concluded by saying that the outcome of this case will depend on the future attitude of the US Navy. Japanese Spokesman Advocates Caution: A Japanese Embassy spokesman declared at a press conference yesterday that the discovery of anti-American slogans in the Hongkou District was purely the work of several people on their own initiative. If this matter is considered illegal or unreasonable, appropriate measures should be taken to avoid the aggravation of relations between the countries in the International Settlement. Regarding the title used by the Japanese-language Mainland News yesterday, the spokesman admitted that it was indeed exaggerated, but exaggerated newspaper titles exist everywhere and are difficult to curb. The spokesman concluded by saying that whether the slogans posted on the wall and the titles published in the newspaper insult Americans or the United States is not definite and depends on the individual opinions of each person. The Japanese Military Prepares to Issue New Proclamation: The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post stated that this morning (the 10th), the US and Japanese military authorities in this city held different views on the results of the US military's arrest of 16 Japanese military police on Sunday. The attitude of the US side was that after the statement issued by Colonel Baker, commander of the US military stationed in Shanghai, yesterday (the 9th), this matter can now be regarded as over. However, Japanese officials denied that the matter has been resolved. The Japanese military plans to issue a new proclamation at 1:00 p.m. today, but the details have not yet been learned.

### Japanese Soldiers Seize the Greater Shanghai Evening Post: Japanese sentries at the Hongqiao entrance and exit took high-pressure action last night, seizing the English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post from a news vendor and refusing to return it, resulting in 41 subscribers to the English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post on Anhe Temple Road not receiving their newspapers last night. It is learned that the English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post yesterday carried news of the arrest of Japanese military police and Colonel Baker's talk, which led to it being seized by Japanese sentries. Upon hearing the news, the English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post immediately sent foreign personnel to the Japanese military headquarters on Anhe Temple Road to inquire. The Newspaper Asks the US Consulate to Negotiate: A Japanese person told them that the Japanese side "opposes" the news of Lieutenant General Miura's apology on the front page of the newspaper. Regarding this matter, the English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post will file a protest with the US Consulate this afternoon, because subscribers who did not receive their newspapers have already filed complaints. It is noted that Japanese sentries in the Hongkou District had previously confiscated the English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post, but it is believed that the matter has been handled by the Japanese authorities to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. The Ministry of Economic Affairs Protects Trademarks; If Factories Cannot Resume Operations, Trademarks Should Be Considered Interrupted: The Ministry of Economic Affairs, based on the Shanghai Joint Association of Machine-Made National Goods Factories' submission that manufacturers cannot resume operations during extraordinary times, requested a clear order to protect trademarks in order to demonstrate legal benefits. The Trademark Bureau prepared measures and submitted them to the Executive Yuan for approval. The Ministry of Economic Affairs ordered the Trademark Bureau to be informed. The original order is recorded below. The Ministry of Economic Affairs order reads, "Based on the Executive Yuan's Yangzi No. 3656 instruction dated February 22nd of the 29th year of the Republic of China, for this Ministry's Shangzi No. 53120 submission dated February 13th of the 29th year of the Republic of China, based on the Shanghai Joint Association of Machine-Made National Goods Factories' submission, for the case where manufacturers cannot resume operations during extraordinary times, please issue a clear order to protect trademarks, and for the order from the Trademark Bureau to reply to various items, please approve and forward the information," etc. This order was issued because this case was previously submitted to the Ministry by the association. It stated that all manufacturers who cannot resume operations during extraordinary times should have their trademarks, which are no longer in use, considered interrupted. If they are infringed upon, they may be prosecuted according to the law, and the matter may be announced in newspapers. The Ministry deemed this feasible, but the Ministry ordered the Trademark Bureau to reply, stating, "Upon investigation, the reasons why national goods factories stop using trademarks during extraordinary times are no more than the following four: (1) The factory is occupied and cannot produce products; (2) The operation is suspended due to violent coercion; (3) All production and business operations are damaged by artillery fire and cannot be resumed for a time; (4) The war has affected operations and led to suspension. In order to adapt to the facts and prevent abuse, all manufacturers who have one of the above reasons and stop using trademarks must prepare accurate documents and submit them to the Bureau for verification. However, after verification, or based on evidence to the contrary from interested parties, if the report is found to be untrue, it may still be handled in accordance with the provisions of Article 18 of the Trademark Law," etc. This matter has been reported to the Executive Yuan for review and has been forwarded to the Judicial Yuan for forwarding to the Executive Yuan and the courts. For this reason, in addition to notifying the Shanghai Joint Association of Machine-Made National Goods Factories, you must comply with this order.

### The Belgian Ambassador Will Not Return to Shanghai Temporarily; Will Come South After Autumn Cools Down: Belgian Ambassador to China Guillaume, who left Shanghai in May to inspect the affairs of the embassy in Tianjin and other places, has been away for two months. Previous reports stated that the ambassador had urgent embassy business in Shanghai and would return to Shanghai soon. According to the reporter of Dachung News Agency, who inquired from the embassy, the embassy and consulate have not received any definite news about Ambassador Guillaume's return to Shanghai. The ambassador is still staying in Beiping and will not return to Shanghai for the time being. Because the summer vacation has arrived, the ambassador does not intend to travel long distances again. Moreover, at this time every year, the consulates in Shanghai only work in the morning and send staff to stay on duty in the afternoon. Unless there are important official matters, all work is suspended, and the responsible persons must also go to Qingdao, Beidaihe, and other places to avoid the heat. Although the current situation is unstable, the office hours of the Belgian consulates have also been changed to half a day. Therefore, the date of Ambassador Guillaume's return to Shanghai will be in the autumn season. The Military Supplies on the Shengjing Ship Have Not Yet Been Unloaded: The ship is Still Anchored Outside Wusong Port; British and French Military Commanders Have Submitted Negotiations: The Taikoo Company's Shengjing ship, which sailed from Tianjin to Shanghai this time, entered Wusong Port yesterday (the 9th). The details have been recorded in yesterday's newspaper because it was detained because it was loaded with military supplies for the French army in Tianjin. The passengers on the ship were immediately sent by the company to pick up small boats and landed in full. The record is as follows, based on the findings of the investigation. Taikoo Company had received a telegram from Tianjin on the 6th of this month, reporting that the Shengjing ship would be released from Tianjin to Shanghai that night, and said that the ship was loaded with 794 pieces of military supplies sent by the French army in Tianjin. The company listened and believed that this was in accordance with normal procedures, and the military supplies had been passed by the Tianjin Customs and listed in the manifest, so there was no doubt. The company immediately informed the French authorities in this port that there were French military supplies being shipped from Tianjin and were now en route. The company intended to issue a bill of lading when the ship arrived in Shanghai to facilitate the inspection and release of the cargo by the Jianghai Customs. The military supplies shipped by Shengjing this time were all in accordance with previous procedures and were not exceptional. The company's transportation of military supplies from the Tianjin French authorities to Shanghai has become a part of its ordinary business, and the packages it loads are handled in the same way as other goods.

### Passengers Land: This time, the Shengjing had 227 passengers on board. When the Navy took action on the ship that day, the passengers and crew thought that a catastrophe was imminent and were very panicked. Yesterday morning, the company negotiated with the naval authorities and was allowed to let the passengers disembark first. The company hired the Swire No. 1 lighter from Huidefeng to transport the passengers to Sanjiazhui and land at the Xinguang Wharf at 5:15 p.m. yesterday. Therefore, all the passengers on the ship landed safely yesterday, but the Chinese and foreign crew members were still on the ship. Although a small number of Japanese troops were stationed on the ship, everything was still free and safe. The ship was loaded with more than 2,000 pieces of fruit. Fearing that it would rot over time, the company sent three ships yesterday and planned to unload some of the fruit first. It is currently negotiating with the Japanese army and hopes to be able to load it out. There Was No Gold: When the Japanese army escorted the ship to Wusong Port yesterday, the Japanese army searched it extensively. It was rumored that a batch of gold was transported from Tianjin to Shanghai, totaling 200 bars weighing 2,000 taels, worth more than 1 million yuan in national currency. All of them were seized by the Japanese army. Yesterday, there were various rumors in the financial circles of this port. The Japanese Side's Attitude: However, this statement was quickly found to be inaccurate. According to Japanese sources, at 2:00 p.m. yesterday (the 9th), a Japanese naval patrol boat intercepted the British-owned Taikoo Company's Shengjing ship outside Wusong Port. The Japanese Navy received information that the ship was suspected of carrying 1.21 million rounds of rifles belonging to a "belligerent country" that were originally stored in the Tianjin Concession. It is heard that the Japanese naval authorities are currently preparing to file a strong protest with the British authorities.

### Import Still Awaiting: The Shengjing ship is currently anchored outside Wusong Port, and there is no definite news about import as of last night.

### Spain, Then and Now

Four hundred years ago, Spain was the richest country and possessed the most powerful navy in the world. Ships at sea carried gold, silver, and spices from South America and the West Indies for its king. However, its system had a weakness! Spain could only consume and not produce. The people lived a leisurely life, relying on tribute from the colonies. This situation was similar to ancient Greece and Rome: Greece thrived on the resources of the Delian League, and Rome relied on wheat and wine from distant provinces for its survival. When England seized Spanish ships, the Spanish people were left with extreme boredom, idly awaiting their demise.

New Spain is striving to restore its past glory. José Antonio Primo de Rivera, the son of Spain's former dictator Miguel Primo de Rivera, founded the Falange Española (Spanish Fascist Party) to achieve this goal. Although their resources are extremely scarce, with a million casualties in the civil war and no hope of foreign aid, they believe that Spain can still be revived and transformed into a great power, and that only Spaniards can accomplish this mission. Some enthusiastic members even dream of restoring Spain's former colonies, using Morocco as a base. Economically speaking, four-fifths of the Spanish people are in dire straits, living on the brink of starvation daily. The main sustenance for the vast rural population is a paste made from acorn flour. The first ideal of the Falange Española is to raise Spaniards above the state of chronic malnutrition.

The current famine is due to last year's poor harvest. During the planting season last year, the nation's able-bodied men were engaged in the final stages of the war. The area planted was minimal, and the cultivation of the land was done hastily. This year's harvest is better. Because trains were running slowly, the reporter flew across the country. The plane was made in Italy and flew not far from the ground, allowing the reporter to get a superficial view in some places. The area sown is vast, in fact, all the fertile fields have been sown, but the seeds are very sparsely distributed, seemingly due to a shortage of seeds. However, the growing stalks of grain are excellent, and by July, the Spanish people should have sufficient food.

Regarding retail commerce, the reporter visited several department stores to observe. The variety of goods was not large, but the displays were neat and beautiful. The sales staff were courteous, and prices were about the same as last year, but the quality of the goods was inferior. Most of the goods were made in Germany, and business was quite slow.

Cafés, from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m., are crowded with people engaged in secret talks. When the reporter passed by, they stopped talking, waiting until you were out of earshot. Is it because whispering is a crime and slander is considered treason? The total income of bars is probably not very high, because a customer has the right to occupy a seat, spend two cents on coffee, and pass the day. American-style convertibles, driven by sixteen-year-olds, roar through the streets, but the cars are empty. More than half of the commercial businesses have "For Rent" or "For Sale" signs posted.

Barbers and beauticians are thriving. The so-called "American style" is popular among Spaniards. This is simply not wearing a hat when going out. The reporter counted five hundred men on a street corner, and only two were wearing hats. Among five hundred women, three hundred and twenty were fair-skinned and blonde, but in reality, they all had dark complexions.
