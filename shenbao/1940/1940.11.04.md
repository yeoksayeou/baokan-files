Editorial: Sino-Japanese Relations

A perusal of recent Japanese statements reveals a near-unanimous acknowledgment of the myriad obstacles facing the so-called "construction of a new order in East Asia" and a deep awareness of the difficulties that lie ahead for Japan. Had the Japanese possessed such awareness earlier, the Pacific crisis might not have escalated to its current severity. Japan could have avoided its present predicament and even capitalized on the European conflict to usher in a new golden age. Unfortunately, Japan has created irreparable errors.

The root causes of Japan's political, military, and diplomatic failures lie in its underestimation of its adversaries and its short-sightedness. Its underestimation of others led to reckless adventurism, fueled by the illusion that it would encounter minimal resistance. Its short-sightedness prevented it from accurately assessing situations, resulting in actions that yielded outcomes contrary to expectations. For the past decade, whether in its war of aggression against China or its dealings with foreign powers, Japan has consistently committed these two fundamental blunders. Even when it occasionally displays some understanding, it is often after encountering setbacks. The major errors it has made, however, are rarely corrected. The recent evolution of Sino-Japanese relations powerfully illustrates this phenomenon.

In its perception, Japan has consistently viewed Great Britain in the Far East as its immediate adversary. Exploiting Britain's perilous position and clinging to the unchanging nature of its appeasement policies, Japan has persistently fantasized about forcing Britain into submission, believing that doing so would pave the way for the fulfillment of its grand ambitions. Towards the United States, however, it has maintained a respectful distance, privately assuming that as long as it could secure Britain's acquiescence, it could afford to disregard the United States. Despite the fact that for nine years, the United States had unveiled the doctrine of non-recognition in the Far East, delivered a stern warning to Japan in a speech by Grew in 1938, and cancelled commercial treaties with Japan, which consistently demonstrates the firmness and consistency of the US Far East policy, Japan has always believed that America's caution is merely a disguised form of cowardice, and it is permissable to deceive them. The fact that America is across the ocean to wage war on Japan has always seemed inconceivable. As France fell and America became concerned for its own security, this sentiment became even more pronounced. Japan openly included the territories of various countries in the South Seas into the sphere of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. It declared that it would no longer adopt a conciliatory approach towards the United States and even further colluded with Germany and Italy to threaten America. Konoe and Matsuoka once issued threats to the United States, not hesitating to go to war, and the anti-American movement rose accordingly. This situation developed to its highest peak a month ago. But it was not that Japan was really sure of defeating the United States, but only that it estimated that while the war on the European continent was in full swing, the United States might only make empty high-profile statements to Japan due to the threat from the Atlantic and the constraints of the election issue. However, the result was obviously the opposite. The US response was not compromise and concession, but embargoes, military expansion, preparations, evacuation of僑民, and increased aid to China. The Japanese authorities' attitude changed 180 degrees from the day the US turned tough, engaging in various defenses and explanations. It even stated, regardless of how Germany and Italy felt, that the Three-Nation Alliance was not aimed at the United States. When war broke out between Italy and Greece, it tried to evade its mutual aid obligations. This attitude was brought to the extreme by Matsuoka and Suma of the Kasumigaseki authorities. Recently, due to the recall of Ambassador to the United States Kensuke Horinouchi, he once intended to replace him with General Kobayashi, who was "pro-American" and "opposed to the Tripartite Alliance," and return to the old tune of Abe and Nomura. However, the task of adjusting US-Japanese relations is different from a year ago. According to Tokyo news yesterday, Matsuoka consulted many people in the diplomatic community, but no one was willing to accept the position of US ambassador because it was extremely difficult to please the US in the current situation. Tokyo people said they hoped that the US would not doubt Japan's dissatisfaction with the US because the envoy had been suspended for a long time. This type of phenomenon is very different from Matsuoka's style of advocating for innovative diplomacy, and it is very different from his attitude a month ago, but these are all confirmed facts.

American domestic and foreign policies have always been calm and firm, which is very different from Japan's wavering and changeableness. The Japanese side once explained the recent tough attitude of the United States as a gesture during the election process. If so, then why is the Japanese side so careful in seeking to ease the situation? It can be seen that this is just a self-consoling rhetoric. Japan is very clear that the United States' foreign policy will not change due to the election. The recent Japanese public opinion has fully demonstrated the general panic.

However, this situation cannot be regarded as Japan intending to repent. At most, it is just self-alerting and expecting something in an increasingly difficult environment. Because it is always very unwise for today's Japan to rashly challenge the United States. The disparity in military and economic strength, the constraints of the war against China, and the stalemate in Soviet-Japanese diplomacy are all major weaknesses of the Japanese side. Recently, the extreme moderation of the Japanese authorities' attitude towards the United States, if it is not hoping that the US's firm policy will tend to relax - this possibility is extremely small - then at least it is to delay time, so as to complete the economic exploitation of the Asian continent and the South Seas, the reduction and even the end of the war against China, and the success of the negotiations with the Soviet Union. These attempts are now being carried out in different ways. They are cooperating with the moderate appearance of Matsuoka and Suma. In addition, the development of the European war situation is also an important factor. The recent support of Germany and Italy has undoubtedly depreciated the courage of the Japanese consortium. If Germany and Italy quickly gain the upper hand, it will also be another impulse for the Japanese side to engage in adventure.

Although recent Japanese public opinion has been able to recognize the seriousness of its own situation, before it can overcome the power of the radical faction, its conclusion must not be to rein in at the precipice, but to step up preparations. Look at the Kokumin Shimbun, the mouthpiece of the military, which has not changed its consistent hard-line position on the United States, and has never criticized Matsuoka's moderate diplomacy. Obviously, this is another masterpiece of the two-sided policy. Matsuoka's personality is slightly different from that of Shiratori, but he will not suddenly become a follower of the Shidehara line because of the attack by the American big stick. It is not difficult to learn the outline of the future of US-Japanese relations from this main tone of the Japanese side.

Artillery Battle Suddenly Ceases along the Greek-Albanian Border

Belgrade, Yugoslavia: The artillery battle on the Greek-Albanian border, which shook the Pissabo region, suddenly ceased this morning. Observers believe that the Italian army has abandoned its plan for a large-scale offensive against Florina. It is expected that the Italian army will retreat to its original positions, reorganize its military, and launch a new offensive. There are reports of fierce fighting near Korkal in Albania. News from the Yugoslav border reports that British and Greek aircraft have heavily bombed several military centers in Albania. There are also reports of fierce battles taking place in Losia, with intensified Italian mountain troops clashing with elite Greek mountain troops. Yesterday, the Italian army launched simultaneous attacks with infantry and mechanized units, attempting to forcefully repel the brave Greeks. The amazing progress of the Greek army has hindered the advance on Florina and has greatly threatened the flanks and rear of the Italian army. Today's battle reports indicate that the fighting is most intense on the south bank of Lake Prespa. The number of casualties on both sides is extremely high. The war was launched yesterday after a column of Italian mountain troops occupied the Greek border village of Bekel. According to border battle reports, Greek troops engaged in close combat and launched a counterattack, driving the Italian troops out of the border. While Greek troops were capturing several border cities in Albania, Italy was rushing reinforcements to aid them. The outcome of the battle near Pellisba has not been clarified as of this morning.

Greek Troops Advance Deep into Albania, Threatening Italian Forces' Rear

Bitola, Yugoslavia: It is reported that the Greek troops who conquered Pirkestai continued to advance into the interior yesterday, penetrating nine kilometers into Albania. It is said that the Greek troops advanced to a stronghold from Florina to Korca. The Greek offensive is aimed at stopping the Italian army from entering Florina at any cost, because the area would allow the Italian motorized troops to advance along the road to Thessaloniki. In addition, the offensive can cut off traffic between the lakes of Berles and Ochrida, thus prevent Italian supplies from getting through. (3rd United Press Dispatch)

Italian Newspapers Review Strategy; Three Possible Routes of Attack

Milan: "Il Tempo" newspaper published an article today discussing the possibility of how the Italian army's attack on Greece will progress. There are three possible directions: (1) Attack Ioannina, (2) Attack Larissa, (3) Attack Florina and Thessaloniki. Its motives can be described separately. (1) Its purpose is to conquer the Epirus region. (2) Its purpose is to attack Athens. (3) Cut off the connection between the Greek peninsula and Ceres. So far, only the name Ioannina has been mentioned in Italian military reports, but it is difficult to speculate on how Italian military actions will develop in the future. (1st Huitong Agency)

Greek Artillery Positions in the Mountains Bombard Italian Forces from Risky Heights

Athens: Greek artillery positions, which had opened up into the snowy highlands in the Visenteri Mountains at night, started bombarding the Italian mechanized troops approaching mountain passes at dawn yesterday. While the Greek army defended new positions in these mountains, Greek Air Force also drove back any Italian aircraft that intended to bomb Thessaloniki. The political situation in Athens has been showing significant developments. Military officials here are very excited about rumors regarding British ships arriving at Crete and the rapid preparation of naval and air bases there. The capture of Visenteri Mountain by the Greek army came as a great surprise to the Italian army, which had admitted to the route up the mountain being difficult and dangerous to take. The way in which the Greek engineers enabled the army to ascend it has been described as shockingly remarkable. Both army personnel and heavy artillery have been hauled up and down the mountain on rope slings in baskets not unlike life preservers, as if they were cargo being lifted by cranes. Deep mountain caves serve as natural air raid shelters, so the effect of Italian aircraft attacks against Greek troops yesterday afternoon was limited. As the Italian army launched a fierce counterattack, intending to reclaim the important ground, Greek army had already stationed troops within it. National mobilization in Greece was completed yesterday, with many Greek men departing for the front lines. The Greek army, under the command of General Gambias, will soon launch a fierce counteroffensive on Korce. As Greece consolidates its forces to resist the invasion, the Greek High Command is already in consultation with British naval and air experts to prepare for a winter war. It is said that the naval bases of Greece have been occupied by allied fleets. Authoritative sources have reported that naval and air actions to attack the Dodecanese Islands are imminent. Yesterday afternoon, an Italian hydroplane attacked Central Fleet, but was repulsed. The Greek mainland and its islands have swiftly become naval and air bases against the Italians, but although the progress of the Italian army has been blocked, the offensive by the Italian Air Force has intensified. Corfu has been cruelly bombed by Italian aircraft. The first report from the island says that eight civilians have been bombed to death and twenty have been injured. In Khandia, ten have been bombed to death and twenty have been injured. Patras has been bombed again, resulting in multiple fires. However, it is said that the deaths and injuries are lighter than before because people have been able to quickly retreat into air raid shelters. (3rd United Press Dispatch)

Greek Determination to Resist Exceeded German and Italian Expectations

London: A Reuters diplomatic correspondent says that the reason why Italy has not put all its efforts into attacking Greece is that they did not initially expect the Greek people to unite in resistance. They are still hoping to use German aid and schemes to achieve results without fighting. Now the arguments in German and Italian newspapers suggest that this statement is not without reason. Several Italian newspapers are arguing strongly that there is no deep-seated hatred between the Italian and Greek peoples, but that the Greek leaders were seduced and confused, failing to see the benefits of cooperation with the Axis powers. It is clear that Italy has been preparing for war against Greece for several months. They have not only concentrated large armies in Albania and stockpiled military supplies to avoid the transportation dangers of crossing the Otranto Strait, but also built roads throughout Albania to reach the Albanian border. What is the reason for the lack of rapid progress in the war against Greece, despite such long preparations? It is difficult to understand. The Italian side is using bad weather as the only excuse for the slow progress, but the mountainous areas of Epirus etc. have never had marshes that cannot be moved forward. Although there are no good roads, the land is dry and would not hinder the march of the army even after rain. It is something that dictatorships cannot understand that the people of small countries love freedom so much that they are willing to sacrifice everything. The unity and patriotism of the Greek people seem to have exceeded the expectations of Germany and Italy. Although there are rumors that Hitler and Mussolini do not entirely agree on the invasion of Greece, judging from previous events, Italy must have made arrangements in advance and would never have launched it hastily without being sure. It is said that the Italian army's offensive against Greece is a feint to induce the Central State to go to war or to induce the Turkish state to move troops from Thrace to help Greece. If the Italian tactics really have this strategy, then what they planned is just like what they guessed, that Greece will surely be at their mercy, and they will both fail. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)

British Air Force Heavily Bombs Berlin Station, Dropping Many Tons of Bombs Causing Large Fires, Naples, Italy, Also Attacked

London: On Friday night, the British Air Force launched an extremely heavy concentrated attack on Berlin. When the British planes returned, they saw fires burning in Berlin for a mile, and the flames were still raging 150 miles away through the clouds. British planes repeatedly dropped heavy high-explosive bombs on Berlin stations and railway traffic, including three important railway centers, hitting targets and destroying them. Several places caught fire, and the fire was more intense than the British planes had ever seen in Germany. The first attack on Berlin began just after 10 p.m. and lasted two hours. At that time, the city area was foggy. The British planes dropped flares and quickly found the Helleschestrol station, a quarter of a mile from the city center, and the railway yards between the Postdamer and Anhalter stations, which were closer to the city center. The Hellesche station was bombed by many tons of high-explosive bombs and hundreds of incendiary bombs. Several places in the station caught fire, and the Postdamer station was also heavily bombed. Other targets attacked included the Tier Park station, the main intersection a quarter of a mile northeast of Berlinger Street, and a freight yard between the Ruritz Street military station and the Lairder station. Four hours after the end of the first raid, the second batch of British planes flew to Berlin and dropped bombs, and explosions continued. Klingenburg and Charlottenburg, important power plants, were also attacked. The British planes concentrated their bombing on the Klingenburg power plant for 15 minutes. It is estimated that the fire area occupied a quarter of a square mile. One of the British planes saw flames soaring 150 miles away from Berlin on its way home. The captain of the plane participated in 56 attacks on Germany. He said that the fire he had seen in Germany was never so extensive. The Charlottenburg power plant was hit repeatedly by large bombs dropped by another British plane, and many places caught fire. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)

London: The British Aviation Ministry's intelligence department said that on Thursday night, British planes attacked Naples, Italy, for 45 minutes.

The British planes attacked a station and a railway intersection at an altitude of 2,000 feet. One anti-aircraft gun position was hit and could not fight back. (3rd Reuters Agency)

Fierce Air Battle over the Seas in Southeastern England; Nine German Planes Shot Down

London: This morning, the Royal Air Force drove German bombers out of the country through brave battles. Over 200 aircraft fought over the southeast coast of England yesterday, and several Italian aircraft participated. The Royal Air Force resisted strongly, and finally launched a counterattack and drove the enemy aircraft out of the airspace. It is said that when the enemy aircraft escaped, they were divided into countless small groups. As a result of the air battle, at least one large Italian bomber with a variable engine was shot down by the British in an unknown village. When the Italian plane hovered at low altitude, the anti-aircraft fire fired intensively. The German aircraft continued to try, but were finally broken into London, but were immediately repelled by the intense anti-aircraft fire. An enemy aircraft broke through the London defense line and dropped many incendiary bombs in the southeast area. A huge fire soared into the sky and could be seen for miles. (3rd United Press Dispatch)

London: According to reports received as of late last night, nine German aircraft were shot down by British warplanes yesterday. No British aircraft were lost.

A few bombs fell in the Kent area, but the loss of life and material damage were minimal. In the second large-scale attack, about 100 enemy aircraft were scattered by British fighters and anti-aircraft defenses. Only a few enemy aircraft sneaked into the sky over London and flew very high. A few bombs fell in the Kent area, and the material damage and casualties were light. A few enemy aircraft also attacked the mouth of the Thames River in the morning and dropped bombs in Kent and Essex, causing slight material damage and slight casualties. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)

London: Germany's nightly air raids on London continued as usual shortly after dusk last night. A lone aircraft flew at low altitude, so low that anti-aircraft guns could not bomb it. After breaking into London's air defenses, the aircraft strafed several streets with machine guns. There were scattered German air raids in London last night, and the alert was lifted just after midnight, but London issued an air raid alert again before dawn. The German aircraft's air raids on other central areas of England were also relaxed. (3rd National Community Dispatch)

Turkey's Foreign Policy Takes Security as a Premise, Preventing Germany's Wild Fantasies about Turkey

Angora: Turkish President Inonu's remarks in Congress were not only satisfactory to those who opposed the Axis powers here, but also agreed by everyone in Congress. This can be seen from the enthusiastic cheers when the Turkish President left the meeting after his speech. The Turkish President's statement on the unbreakable connection of the British-Turkish alliance deserves attention, because this is the first time that Turkey has officially announced the importance of this alliance since the outbreak of the European War, and it is also meaningful when the Axis powers' war zone is gradually approaching the Turkish border. The Turkish President's remarks on the Italian-Greek conflict are also valued by everyone. The Turkish President clearly stated that when the war approaches the security zone that is extremely important to Turkey, Turkey does not want to avoid neutrality. Although the Turkish President did not say clearly what Turkey will do, he did not say that Turkey will not take action at that time. In practice, Turkey cannot actively provide military assistance to Greece in the current environment. However, the Turkish President's warning that Greece is within Turkey's area of interest should make the protectorate aware. It is expected that the Turkish government will soon adopt special plans to increase its military preparations and prevent the Axis powers from expanding their military activities near Turkey. The Turkish President's statement that belligerent countries will not be allowed to use Turkish territory, territorial waters, or airspace when Turkey does not participate in the war can now prevent Germany from having the wild fantasies that Turkey will be like Romania and can be used by it. It can also satisfy the Soviet Union, because the Soviet Union suspects that Britain wants to borrow Turkish bases. The Turkish President's statement that friendly relations with the Soviet Union have been restored can also dispel the mutual suspicions between Turkey and the Soviet Union. Observers here believe that judging from the Turkish President's entire speech, this is a realistic statement of Turkey's post-war policy. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)

Belgrade, Yugoslavia: Political figures here believe that Turkish President Ismet's speech has clearly stated that if other Balkan countries do not interfere in the Italian-Greek war and Turkey is not attacked, then Turkey does not want to participate in the war. They believe that Southern countries recently announced their neutral attitude, and the Turkish President has re-released this speech. The situation in the Balkans has been clarified, and the Italian-Greek war can be localized. (3rd Huitong Agency)

Hungary: Diplomatic circles here recently recognized that the most important development in the situation in Benstans is that the Soviet Union firmly extended its battle front to the periphery of the Balkans. Because Turkey's public recognition of its friendship with Moscow is equivalent to a "red light" under Moscow's protection to counter the Axis powers' oppression of Southeast Europe. The Soviet Union is now the only European country that can express this firm attitude and restrict the Axis powers' arrogance. Those who believe that Turkish President Inonu could not have used such a tough tone in his speech to Congress on Friday without reaching an agreement with the Soviet Union in advance.

The Current State of the Exchange Clearance Currency - Zhang Jiake
Later Exchange Clearance
Exchange clearance was originally a type of bill standard issued by Shanghai money shops. This type of bill was cashable the day after issue. However, if no cashing was required (i.e., credited to a deposit account), it could be credited to the account on the same day. The difference between exchange clearance and "割頭" (gu tou, a type of negotiable instrument) is that, in principle, exchange clearance is a bill cashable the day after issue, while "割頭" is cashable on the same day, a difference of one day's interest. In reality, within the same transfer zone (foreign and Chinese merchants), both exchange clearance and "割頭" could be credited on the same day, equivalent to being cashable on the same day. Therefore, before the war, when transferring accounts between foreign and Chinese merchants, the difference between the two became apparent in different transfer areas. However, within the same area, both were equivalent to cashable bills, possessing the ability to pay in legal tender, with no significant difference. Consequently, some believe that exchange clearance is the bill standard for Chinese merchants, primarily money shops, while "割頭" is the bill standard for foreign merchants, primarily foreign banks. This explanation aligns well with the facts.

Exchange clearance is a customary bill currency, not legal tender. Therefore, in the past, all transactions, whether exchange clearance or "割頭," were acceptable as long as they could be cashed in legal tender. However, after August 13th, exchange clearance was granted legal tender status by national law. Article 1 of the Supplementary Measures for Stabilizing Finance stipulates: "Promissory notes issued by iron money shops must uniformly bear the exchange clearance mark of the industry association. These notes are only permitted for exchange clearance among Shanghai industry members and cannot be exchanged for legal tender or used to purchase foreign exchange." This effectively granted exchange clearance limited legal tender status within the Shanghai industry transfer area. The nature of exchange clearance after this point clearly differed from the past. Its main characteristic was that exchange clearance had become a locked deposit currency. The sole purpose of this decree was to restrict the outflow of funds.

At this time, Shanghai's currency standard split into two: legal tender and non-legal tender exchange clearance with limited settlement qualifications. In reality, the government did not need to use the exchange clearance system to prevent capital flight, as the locking effect achievable through the exchange clearance system was very limited. Moreover, tens of millions of legal tender were circulating in Shanghai at that time. With no restrictions on purchasing foreign exchange with legal tender, even if holders of exchange clearance did not participate in capital flight, the purchase of foreign exchange with this batch of legal tender would have been sufficient to have an impact. Furthermore, exchange clearance itself was originally legal tender. Even if exchange clearance could not be directly exchanged for legal tender, merchants could use exchange clearance to purchase goods and then sell the goods, transforming it into legal tender in a single transaction. Therefore, in the early stages of implementation, it had some effect in preventing the outflow of funds. However, after a few months, especially after Shanghai became an isolated island, the more deposits one held, the more one wanted to withdraw them; the more exchange clearance one held, the more one wanted to exchange it for legal tender. Thus, due to the disparity in supply and demand, the circulating exchange clearance and legal tender experienced differences in liquidity and exchange value.

Those who needed to exchange exchange clearance for legal tender had no recourse through legitimate channels because the law stipulated that exchange clearance was "not allowed to be exchanged for legal tender." This began with the "black market" of small money shops. Initially, every 1,000 yuan of exchange clearance required a discount of six or seven yuan to be exchanged for legal tender, gradually increasing. At one point, it exceeded 200 yuan outside the customs area, which was the exchange clearance discount. When the exchange clearance discount reached 79 yuan on June 7, 1938, the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications entrusted the banking industry to jointly intervene, adjusting supply among industry members as much as possible. The initial discount price was 50 yuan per 1,000 yuan, but it also fluctuated with the market. This action by the banking industry association drew criticism from most public opinion at the time because it violated the government's principle of "not paying in legal tender" and contradicted the principle of locking down funds. Simultaneously, publicly posting the discount rate was tantamount to devaluing exchange clearance. In reality, the exchange clearance discount policy was indeed a failure because the level of the exchange clearance discount rate still followed market fluctuations, and intervention did not achieve any significant effect.

Two. The So-Called New Exchange Clearance

The goal of the exchange clearance lockdown system was to lock down circulating capital and bank deposits. After a considerable period, the amount of legal tender withdrawn increased, and capital flight intensified. During the most severe period of capital flight, the black market for foreign exchange inevitably tightened. At this time, legal tender flowed back into the hands of national banks in large quantities through the purchase of foreign exchange. Therefore, the tightening of foreign exchange and the surge in the exchange clearance discount almost became the same trend. On June 7, 1939, the Shanghai foreign exchange black market experienced a tightening frenzy, and capital flight entered a new stage. To limit the trend of capital flight, the Ministry of Finance announced the "Ma Telegram," stipulating that from June 22nd, Shanghai banks and money shops would pay legal tender deposits made after August 13th as follows: For weekly withdrawals of 500 yuan or less, legal tender would be paid; withdrawals exceeding 500 yuan would be paid in exchange clearance. At this time, public sentiment was already shaken by the sudden tightening of foreign exchange. This restriction caused a run on banks and money shops, and the withdrawn exchange clearance was hastily exchanged for legal tender, with the exchange clearance discount rising to 200 yuan, an unprecedented high price. The "Ma Telegram" temporarily achieved some effectiveness in limiting capital flight, but from the perspective of the overall financial situation, it did not reduce panic. After succeeding in tightening the currency supply, it became necessary to adopt the opposite policy to relieve the panic in the banking and money shop industry, which was what everyone called the new exchange clearance.

The new exchange clearance adopted two steps: (1) The 22 million yuan of exchange clearance deposits held by banks and money shops in the banking industry reserve were converted into legal tender in consultation with the Joint Reserve Board of the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Agricultural Bank, and Farmers Bank, based on the balance of each bank and money shop on June 30th, at a uniform rate of 19.5% (i.e., calculated at an exchange clearance discount rate of 50 yuan), over twelve weeks from July 4th to September 25th. (2) Each bank and money shop could use property as collateral to obtain exchange clearance, with a total amount of 50 million yuan. These steps immediately provided banks and money shops with the convenience of exchanging for legal tender, while also alleviating the panic of a lack of capital. However, because exchange clearance could be exchanged for cash through discounting, this policy was effectively equivalent to abolishing the past "lockdown" and "tightening" policies. From a theoretical perspective, neither was the best approach.

Furthermore, the long-term discount gap between exchange clearance and legal tender should bear some responsibility for this new exchange clearance system. Why? Originally, exchange clearance on the market, after a long period of discount, could be turned into legal tender at a discount. At that time, the relationship between legal tender and exchange clearance, expressed in an equation, was: "Exchange clearance plus exchange clearance discount equals legal tender." Therefore, using exchange clearance to pay for things where legal tender was required was the same as paying with legal tender. However, after the issuance of the new exchange clearance, the market had an additional 50 million yuan of exchange clearance positions, naturally increasing the supply. As a result, the exchange clearance discount rate remained at around 100 yuan for almost the entire period. In April of this year, a new high price of 240-250 yuan was witnessed.

The main strength of the exchange clearance system lay in the lockdown, but under the principle that exchange clearance could be exchanged for legal tender (i.e., with the exchange clearance discount), the effectiveness of the lockdown had long been lost. As for deposits in banks, due to the passage of time, the Measures for Stabilizing Finance and the limitations of the "Ma Telegram" were no longer in effect. At this time, the effectiveness of exchange clearance in the main market was limited to government bonds still being priced in exchange clearance, with only a small number of transactions still using exchange clearance. The rest were counted in legal tender.

Three. The Current State of Exchange Clearance Currency

In recent months, the market price of the exchange clearance discount has been declining daily. By the end of last week, the exchange clearance discount had fallen to only slightly over three yuan per 1,000 yuan. In the government bond market, because the difference between exchange clearance and "劃頭" (hua tou, another type of negotiable instrument) was negligible, "劃頭" pricing was adopted instead. Since the existence of the exchange clearance discount, this can be... What is this?

Here, we need to understand the principle of the level of the exchange clearance discount. Exchange clearance and legal tender are two parallel currencies. The level of the discount rate explains the supply and demand relationship between the two. The decline in the exchange clearance discount does not indicate that the value of exchange clearance has risen, but rather that the quantity of legal tender exceeds demand.

During the period of declining exchange clearance discounts, we need to point out another phenomenon: the Shanghai interbank lending rate also trended downward. Why would the interbank lending rate trend downward? This indicates an excess of funds in the market, and the biggest reason for creating an excess of funds is the loosening of foreign exchange, especially the equilibrium of near- and far-term prices.

Large-scale capital flight causes a tightening of foreign exchange, and the tighter the foreign exchange, the more severe the capital flight. During this period, because those who purchased foreign exchange needed legal tender, and legal tender flowed into banks after purchasing foreign exchange, the supply of legal tender gradually contracted. Due to the tightening of legal tender and foreign exchange, anxious people worried that legal tender would turn into worthless currency, so they eagerly purchased foreign exchange to hoard it. Many importers, anticipating a large amount of legal tender income in the coming months, sold off their legal tender in advance to purchase foreign exchange for the following month to prevent the depreciation of legal tender. As a result, not only did the spot market for foreign exchange contract, but the forward market for foreign exchange also contracted. In the end, due to the difficulty of obtaining legal tender positions, those who purchased forward foreign exchange even exceeded those who purchased spot foreign exchange. In this way, the difference between near- and far-term exchange rates widened, meaning that forward exchange rates were tighter than spot exchange rates. The so-called "arbitrage" transactions arose in this way. At its peak, one could arbitrage four jiao per month, equivalent to a monthly interest rate of 40%. With such high returns from arbitrage, the price of legal tender naturally increased. In terms of exchange clearance, this was a surge in the discount; in terms of interest rates, this was a surge in the interbank lending rate. However, under certain changing circumstances, the outlook for foreign exchange was bullish, and those who held foreign exchange sold it to exchange for legal tender. The supply of legal tender increased, and the supply of foreign exchange also increased, so near- and far-term rates converged. Due to the return of funds, legal tender flowed out of the banks again, ...

In normal times, there is a certain difference between legal tender and exchange clearance. This difference stems from "exchange clearance being cashable the day after issue," which is one day's interest, so it is only a few jiao per thousand. Now, if this trend continues and foreign exchange loosens further, then the exchange clearance discount will naturally decline further, even to the point of disappearing. However, since the decline in the exchange clearance discount is based on the aforementioned reasons, the discount rate may still rise when the aforementioned situation reappears.

Under this current state of exchange clearance currency, what we should be discussing is no longer the issue of the exchange clearance discount, nor the issue of how to lock down legal tender, but rather the entire issue of Shanghai financial management.

First, the exchange clearance lockdown system has now proven to be merely a possible method of locking down funds. Beyond a certain scope and after a certain time, its possibility is lost. Therefore, the only way to lock down funds is to strictly manage exchange controls; there is no other way.

Second, the exchange clearance discount policy adopted by Shanghai financial managers was fundamentally wrong in principle and unsuccessful in method. Because the decline in the exchange clearance discount only indicates that exchange clearance and legal tender can equalize, not that exchange clearance has been completely locked down.

Third, today, the inability of exchange clearance to purchase foreign exchange has disappeared due to the abuse of the foreign exchange market, so it has gradually reverted to its pre-war status as an exchange clearance currency. The main function of exchange clearance was originally lockdown. Now that lockdown is no longer possible, the standard of exchange clearance has reached the point where it can be abolished for the sake of unifying the standard. It is hoped that the financial authorities will abolish the post-war definition of "exchange clearance" and that the banking industry authorities will abolish the standard of exchange clearance with an enlightened attitude so that the capital supply in this city can be unified and the target of irregular financial speculation can be reduced.

Fourth, finally, I feel that to ensure the safety of the Shanghai financial market in the future, everyone should discuss how to secure the circulating capital in the future, how to eliminate foreign exchange speculation inside and outside the industry, and how to adjust the capital in Shanghai to reach a solution.
### Shanghai's Gold Black Market - Yuan Hui

I. The Decline of Gold Bar Speculation

Shanghai was originally a metropolis where speculation thrived. Before the "August 13th" Incident, the gold exchange, which specialized in trading gold bars, was the center of speculation. China does not produce much gold, and China's monetary system does not use the gold standard. Merchants engaged in international trade could entrust banks to buy and sell foreign exchange for the purpose of foreign exchange receipts and payments, and there was very little need to buy, sell, and transport gold as a means of international receipts and payments. Therefore, speculative transactions accounted for the vast majority of Shanghai's gold market. Moreover, due to the lack of capital for gold bars in Shanghai, speculative transactions of short selling and long buying were difficult to settle with physical delivery at the time of delivery, and foreign exchange was often forced to settle the price. However, the foreign exchange used for settlement also changed from time to time, which can be divided into the following five periods:

1.  Before World War I, settlement was in British pounds.
2.  From the World War until 1926, settlement was changed to Japanese yen.
3.  After 1926, settlement was changed back to British pounds.
4.  In September 1931, settlement was changed to US dollars.
5.  From September 9, 1934, settlement was changed to the exchange rate listed by the Central Bank for customs gold.

By the winter of 1935, the National Government implemented the legal tender policy, foreign exchange was stable, and the exchange rate of legal tender was often at the level of one shilling and two pence and 30 US dollars, so speculators lost the basis for creating waves. The price of gold bars fluctuated very little, and the gold exchange's business became sluggish, so gold bar speculation was on the road to decline.

II. The Rise of the Black Market

After the "August 13th" Incident, all exchanges in Shanghai were ordered to suspend business. As the war shifted westward, the status of the Shanghai concessions gradually became special. Refugees from the Jiangzhe area gathered in the isolated island, and funds from the interior also concentrated in one corner of Shanghai. In the spring of 1938, silver and gold shops specializing in decorative gold felt the need for a trading market to facilitate the circulation of cash, so Jin Tongsheng and others, employees of a certain bank, came forward to contact gold and silver industry members to organize the Dayuan Silver Shop on Sichuan Road to buy and sell "烚赤" (sha chi, refined gold) in order to circulate finance among industry members. Moreover, because the government implemented foreign exchange controls, the Shanghai foreign exchange black market arose, and the fluctuations in the foreign exchange black market gradually increased, so the black market for "烚赤" also fluctuated sharply. In addition, because a large amount of floating capital gathered in the city and speculation was prevalent, "烚赤" became one of the speculative transactions. Later, securities firms and money exchangers joined, gradually becoming Shanghai's most prosperous speculative market.

Trading Object: The transaction in the market is limited to spot "烚赤", and the required purity is 997/1000, which is higher than the purity of the gold bars traded before the war, which was 978/1000.

Transaction Unit: Ten market taels are called one bar.

Opening Time: Every Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday, twice a day, from 9:30 am to 12:00 pm and from 2:00 pm to 4:00 pm. There is no market on Wednesdays.

Trading Procedures: Industry members entering the market for trading must be approved by industry members. They do not need to pay margin, nor do they charge each other commission. However, the "烚赤" that is traded should be delivered before the opening of the market the next day. If it is not delivered, the difference should be calculated according to the closing price of the day and paid separately.

Industry Members Entering the Market: According to a survey in September 1940, the following 36 companies have joined the market successively: Tianyuan, Zhenkang, Tongkang, Defu, Chengda, Yuzhong (the above are called silver shops). Yang Mohe, Lao Moyun, Jing, Xintian Shi, Fei Wenyuan, Bei Qingyun, Baocheng, Lao Fengxiang, Fu Fengxiang, Fengxiang Heji, Lao Tianbao (the above are called silver buildings). Tong Fengyong, Shengyuan Yong, Dadecheng, Taikangrun, Yongfeng, Yongfengyu, Tiancheng, Wanxing, Yida, Xiangyu, Sheng Dayong, Rencheng, Yu Fenghang, Xinyuan, Yutai, Xincheng (the above are called gold shops). Tiaotai, Baokang (the above are called money shops).

The above 36 companies are all in the Tianyuan Silver Shop market and can be directly traded. They all have direct telephone lines to report the market at any time. Their position is about the same as that of brokers in the exchange. There are also no less than two or three hundred small money shops and silver shops that operate "烚赤" transactions, all of which are entrusted to the above 36 companies for agency. Each bar entering and exiting pays a commission of one or two yuan. If non-industry members want to operate this speculative transaction, they can entrust these small money shops and silver shops to handle it, and they must pay a margin of 200 yuan to 1,000 yuan for each bar of "烚赤". They must also pay a commission of one yuan to six yuan. If you are bullish, you must also pay interest of 1% to 3%. (According to the market rules, all transactions are spot "烚赤", and the margin paid by customers is only used to prepare for the payment of the difference. If you are bullish, you must buy spot goods, so the price of each bar of "烚赤" must be paid by the money shop and silver shop that handles the transaction, so customers must also pay interest. The income of industry members operating this type of transaction is mainly from commissions and interest.)

III. Market Price Fluctuations

The black market for foreign exchange in Shanghai has been very volatile for the past three years since it occurred in March 1938, so the black market for "烚赤" has also risen and fallen greatly. In 1938, the exchange rate of the US dollar fell from 30 yuan to 21 yuan, and the exchange rate of the British pound fell from one shilling and two pence to eight and a half pence. The black market for "烚赤" rose from more than 1,000 yuan to more than 2,000 yuan, and the statistical high and low range for the whole year reached 669 yuan. Last year, in June 1939, the US dollar suddenly shrank to 11 yuan, the British pound shrank to six and a half pence, and "烚赤" rose to more than 3,000 yuan. In July and August, foreign exchange was blocked, and the US dollar shrank again to 4.6875 yuan and 3.25 pence for the British pound, and "烚赤" rose to 4,800 yuan. In September, due to the outbreak of the European war, foreign exchange was loosened. At the end of November, the Ministry of Finance implemented the policy of nationalizing gold, and the price of gold first fell twice, but then continued to rise to more than 4,000 yuan. The statistical high and low difference for the whole year reached 2,832 yuan. This spring, the foreign exchange hovered around 6 yuan for the US dollar and 4 pence for the British pound, and the price of gold was often around 5,000 yuan. It once fell to 1,020 yuan. On May 3, the foreign exchange suddenly contracted again, the US dollar shrank to 4.3125 yuan, the British pound shrank to 3 pence, and the price of "烚赤" rose to the highest peak of 7,250 yuan. Later, due to the expansion of the European war, German troops invaded the Netherlands and Belgium, and funds from overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia flowed back to Shanghai, and foreign exchange was loosened, and the price of gold gradually fell. In August, the Ministry of Finance announced the commercial exchange rate, which was reduced from 7.5 pence for the British pound to 4.5 pence. Speculators believed that the government had lowered the price of legal tender, so the foreign exchange black market tightened from about 4 pence to 3.7 pence, and the US dollar tightened from about 6 yuan to 5 yuan. The price of gold once rose to 6,480 yuan. In October, the situation in the Pacific was dangerous, and foreign exchange gradually loosened again, and the price of gold fell to 5,385 yuan. The statistical high and low difference reached 3,230 yuan, which shows the drastic rise and fall in the price of gold.

The rise and fall of the market price of "烚赤" roughly follows the black market for foreign exchange, as mentioned above. However, Shanghai does not have much cash, and the export of gold is not free, so the standard price of "烚赤" calculated according to the official US gold price and the US dollar exchange rate (not including transportation costs) is as follows:

X US dollars
20 market taels (purity 0.997)
10 market taels 482.26 grains
480 grains 35 US dollars (official price)
According to this formula, it can be known that one bar in Shanghai should be 35.592972 US dollars. Divide by the US dollar exchange rate to get the fair value price of Shanghai's listing of US gold.

IV. Changing from Spot to Futures

In early October of this year, the situation in the Pacific became increasingly tense, and the US dollar was loosened. Speculators in "烚赤" tried their best to sell short, which caused the market price to fall miserably from 6,480 yuan to 5,475 yuan. Speculators sold short for more than a few bars, and cash was very scarce. Most of the long positions had a background. With their strong strength, they wanted to receive spot goods and were unwilling to release dividends, which led to the squeeze on October 19. Foreign exchange and gold prices went in opposite directions. The US dollar recovered from 5.8115 yuan to 5.84375 yuan, and the gold bar rose from 5,680 yuan to 5,830 yuan, and the highest was nearly 5,900 yuan. After the close, the long positions advocated that all unfinished transactions should be settled at the closing price of the US dollar on the day, which was 5.84375 yuan, which was equivalent to 5,990 yuan. The short positions insisted on not agreeing. Later, a method was used to settle the price at the closing price of the day, which was 5,830 yuan. Since this squeeze, there has been no news of stranded ships among industry members, but it is difficult to trade spot goods. Therefore, the market was closed for three days. The manager of Tianyuan Silver Shop convened a meeting of industry members to reorganize the methods. The "烚赤" market was handled in accordance with the trading methods, and the name was changed to Lianyigonghui. The number of registered members of the association was fixed at 40, and each member had to pay a security deposit of 2,000 yuan, for a total of 800,000 yuan, which was kept by five members of the management committee appointed by the chairman, Pan Sansheng. Zhang Tongsheng, the manager of Dayuan Silver Shop, also served as the manager of Lianyigonghui, responsible for presiding over the affairs. As for the trading object, it was changed to futures "烚赤". The margin for each bar was 400 yuan, and delivery was made twice a month. If delivery was not made when due, the position had to be rolled over, or the price was settled according to the HSBC Bank's listing price of import bills at 9:30 on the day. As for the brokers in the association, the original industry members were added as much as possible, otherwise, they would be supplemented by recruitment.

The Lianyigonghui's futures trading opened on the 24th of this month. There are currently 28 listed brands, namely: 1. Tianyuan, 2. Defu, 3. Xinyuan, 4. Xianghe, 5. Tongkangyong, 6. Hengji, 7. Chengji, 8. Decheng, 9. Shunyuan, 10. Xinfeng, 11. Deda, 12. Chenggda, 13. Dafeng, 14. Yuyuyong, 15. Yida, 16. Wanfeng, 17. Yuni Run, 18. Hesheng, 19. Yutaifeng, 20. Dingsheng, 21. Renchengyong, 22. Mingfeng, 23. Xiangyuyong, 24. Litai, 25. Hongqingyong, 26. Shihe, 27. Huanda, 28. Gongda. Because the original 12 silver shop gangs have not joined, the number of fixed brokers is 40. From the inside, the change in the market! However, it is the trading method, which has been changed from spot to futures "烚赤", but in fact, the significance of this reorganization is not so simple, because if we observe carefully, the speculative transactions of the Lianyigonghui in the future will inevitably hinder the national economy and be even worse than before.

First, although the Tianyuan market trading was mostly speculative, there was still 1-2% of spot trading, and the "烚赤" was delivered. In the context of the concessions still allowing silver shops to publicly buy and sell decorative gold, it was still a function of turning around the money. However, after being reorganized into a futures market and the silver shop gang withdrew, the price can be settled in foreign exchange at the time of delivery, so the Lianyigonghui market trading will inevitably be purely speculative trading, and there will be no cash delivery. Because there is no restriction on cash, the rise and fall of the market price in the future will be even more drastic than before.

First, today's concessions are maintained under international protection, and this black market that violates national laws has occurred. The Japanese are trying to use this black market as a means to undermine the legal tender system and absorb funds. After this reorganization, the Japanese magic hand has openly stretched into the "烚赤" black market, which is undeniable. It is not difficult to know who will control this black market in the future and what a major impact it will have on China's national economy.
### Commercial News and Financial Review - Sheng Kaiqiong

November 2nd

Reasons for the Rise in Government Bonds (Continued)

To study the reasons for the rise in government bonds during this period, we must first understand the changes in the economic environment during this period. Since the signing of the military and economic alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan, the development of the international situation has been very beneficial to China's future. As a result, China's national economic environment has also changed. Significant facts: First, on September 26, the US government officially announced that the US would lend 25 million yuan to China to maintain China's foreign exchange needs, and stated that the US had decided to purchase 30 million yuan worth of gunpowder from the China Resources Committee. Then, Britain realized that it was "helping the evildoers" and abandoned its policy of appeasement in the Far East, and responded to the US loans to China by opening the Burma Road on October 18, so that the necessary resources and economic construction materials could be imported into China, and China's resources could be exported abroad. Later, on October 18, it was reported that the US would lend a huge amount of money to China again, and the discussion was being held by Jones, the administrator of the Federal Loan Administration, and Song Ziwen, the chairman of the Bank of China. Because China's economy has received so much help, its strength has been strengthened, which has made the owners of funds rolling in and out of the speculative market realize that legal tender is still the most solid property. At the same time, foreign exchange in the speculative market is loosening, and foreign stocks are falling, so speculation is not only unprofitable, but also suffers losses. Then, why speculate and harm, rather than invest and benefit! As a result, they turned to government bonds with more than 1% investment benefits. What's more, China has already grasped the winning ticket. If you buy when the bond market is still at a low price, the investment benefits will be even greater. Therefore, in just two months, the market price of high-priced A and B types has risen by more than 1/10, and the price of low-priced C, D, and E types has reached 13%.
The Future of Exchange Clearance Discount

The exchange clearance bill discount market is not directly related to the black market for foreign exchange, but because those who hold exchange clearance funds want to exchange it for foreign exchange when the exchange market is shrinking, the change in the market is based on the change in foreign exchange. For detailed statistics on this change, please refer to The Central Bank Of China Bulletin, 1939 P.257. According to the examples of this year, the discount was as high as 250 yuan during the "May 2" exchange market upheaval. After the exchange market loosened, the discount also fell by 60 yuan. Recently, the group in October hovered within 20 yuan, and since the 26th, it has entered the 10 yuan level, and on November 1, it saw the lowest market of 4 yuan, returning to the situation at the end of 1937. The following is a statistic for the six months from May to October 1938: (The monthly week is the unit, and the lowest in October is 5.5 yuan)

The exchange clearance discount market is based on foreign exchange, but because government bonds are bought and sold with exchange clearance bills, the change in the market price is more subject to the supply and demand rate due to the supply and demand of exchange clearance bills when buying and selling government bonds. In other words, when the foreign exchange market is stable and there is no change or loosening, the discount market will tend to be low due to the large demand for exchange clearance capital. On the contrary, if the demand is small or even not needed, the discount market will tend to be high or stable. Recently, due to the absorption of government bonds by all parties, the demand for exchange clearance capital is large, so the average price has fallen from more than 45 yuan to 27 yuan and then to 13 yuan.

After a large amount of exchange clearance capital was transformed into government bonds, the supply of exchange clearance capital for the purchase and sale of government bonds was insufficient, so it was changed to "劃頭" trading on November 1. Many people think that the trend of exchange clearance discount will disappear. Under the government's legal restrictions, it is of course hoped that it can be as good as the introduction, but in fact, I am afraid it is still difficult to do. The current lack of exchange clearance capital is because it has been converted into government bonds and has not disappeared. The final result is to retreat into the hands of the National Bank. The principal and interest of government bonds are still paid with exchange clearance. A part of the remittances from various ports to Shanghai are also paid with exchange clearance. The exchange clearance capital hidden in the National Bank will slowly flow into the market. Therefore, the current trend of exchange clearance discount is probably still hovering at the current level. It is difficult to be high, and it is not low. The future changes will still depend on the future financial situation.
Reduced Production of Jellyfish

The production of jellyfish this year is not abundant, about 30-40%, so the source is very rare. The existing inventory in the market has been sold successively, and it is deeply felt that there is a shortage. The jellyfish skin is even less, so the price has gradually risen. The sale price has risen from 60 yuan to 110 yuan. The jellyfish head with tape is also required for 75 yuan.
Sharp Decline in Sales of Thin Plain Serge

Yesterday, although the wool was not delivered, the spot transaction was still strong. Winter sales of overcoats, camel hair, medium-thick fancy wool, and thick plain wool were all sold in retail and wholesale. The sales of thin plain serge, whether they were hidden gray camel colors, have decreased greatly. Wholesale is mostly stopped due to the inaccessibility of customer roads. The retail business of the door shops in this street has decreased greatly compared with previous years. Plain serge was originally sold by the crew of the ships. Now the number of ships operating has been greatly reduced. Because they can't make a profit, the gangs in the copper, iron, woodworking, and water yards also often make thin plain serge into clothes and trousers. At the moment, the cost of living is high, and the price of serge is expensive, so they are mostly unable to buy it. Ordinary people, because the price is the same at more than three yuan a foot, now mostly change to cut other fancy goods, so the factory has recently reduced the production of plain serge. Yesterday, Zhanghua thin plain serge was wholesaled for 11.5 yuan per yard, and the Daguangming Honey Rich brand was sold for 12.75 yuan. Grass green and grass yellow were priced at 5 jiao.
The opening auction of Yihwa Brewery shares
Volume of transactions over 380,000 shares in the first week
Down from eight yuan to seven yuan four jiao

The enthusiasm of those who grabbed the new shares of the British Yihwa Brewery Company exceeded eight times the number of shares offered has been detailed in this newspaper. It is heard that most of those who subscribed this time were "scalpers" who made a small profit and sold the shares. Since October 28, the auction has been officially approved by the public association, and the opening price was eight yuan. On November 1, it had fallen to seven yuan one jiao five fen, and the closing price was seven yuan four jiao. The volume of transactions on the first day after the opening reached 176,000 shares, and the total volume of transactions within a week was 382,800 shares.
No Movement in White Lead Skin

The white lead skin market, which has been quiet for a long time, has still not seen any movement recently. Because the appetite of battery factories has weakened (because several larger factories have moved to the interior to operate), and the customers of Qingyi, Qinhuangdao, and other gangs have no sales, the market is quiet, and the market price is hovering. At the moment, No. 2 is sold for 1,200 yuan per barrel, No. 3 and No. 4 are sold for 1,150 yuan, No. 5 and No. 6 are sold for 1,050 yuan, No. 7 and No. 8 are sold for 1,100 yuan, No. 9 is sold for 1,150 yuan,

### The Chinese Army in Southern Guangxi Continues to Advance, Pressing Close to the Outskirts of Zhennanguan; Fierce Fighting with Japanese Troops; Japan Plans to Retreat into Vietnam; Chinese Troops in the Guangdong-Guangxi Border Area Continue to Capture Xiaodong and Dadong

Longzhou: After capturing Pingxiang on the 31st, the Chinese army continued to advance south, pressing close to the outskirts of Zhennanguan on the 1st and engaging in fierce fighting with the Japanese troops. (3rd dispatch)

Nanning: The Chinese army, launching fierce attacks on the south bank of the Yong River, continued to capture Xiaodong on the morning of the 31st and recaptured Dagangxu on the morning of the 2nd. The Japanese troops retreated in panic. (3rd dispatch)

Chongqing: An official announcement was released here today stating that the Chinese army had recaptured Pingxiang, 40 miles south of Longzhou, on October 31st. Pingxiang was the only town in Guangxi where the Japanese troops repeatedly repelled Chinese counter-offensives. The announcement stated that the Japanese troops had retreated towards Zhennanguan. Previous reports indicated that the Japanese troops in Zhennanguan had made various preparations to retreat into French-Indochina (Vietnam). It is also reported that the Chinese army operating on the Qinzhou-Xiaodong highway is closely pursuing the Japanese troops retreating from Qinzhou. (3rd United Press dispatch)

Guilin: The Nanning Comforting Delegation of the Pacification Headquarters' Political Department, and the personnel dispatched by the Provincial Party Headquarters to Nanning and other counties to inspect Party affairs, departed for the Nanning area on the evening of the 3rd. Also, a seven-member Nanning visiting delegation from the Guilin press corps is scheduled to depart on the evening of the 4th. (3rd dispatch)

Chongqing: According to reports in the local newspapers, rumors that the Japanese troops in Nanning were withdrawing to Hainan Island are untrue. The destination of the Japanese retreat is Taiwan. Furthermore, according to Li Jishen, deputy chairman of the Battlefield Party Affairs Committee of the Military Affairs Commission, the Japanese troops withdrew from Nanning for the following reasons: (1) To prepare for defense against Britain and the United States; (2) The people of southern Guangxi are strong and brave, and there is a shortage of grain in the area, causing the Japanese troops to suffer more losses than gains; (3) To concentrate forces in an attempt to achieve success on other battlefields. However, after the Japanese troops withdraw from Nanning, they are unlikely to advance south for the time being, because Britain and the United States are already prepared, and reckless provocation will inevitably lead to a disastrous defeat. It is also impossible to move troops to attack Yunnan. (3rd Havas dispatch)

### Weekly War Situation: 27th to 2nd

Chongqing: A spokesman for the Military Affairs Commission stated that since this week (October 27th to November 2nd), the war results on all fronts have been excellent. The recapturing of Shaoxing in eastern Zhejiang and Nanning in Guangxi Province dealt a great blow to the Japanese. A summary of the battle progress is as follows:

Guangxi and Guangdong

Since last week, the Chinese army in southern Guangxi has launched fierce attacks on the outskirts of Nanning, successively capturing important strongholds along the Yongbin Road. On the Yongwu Road, it captured Gaofeng'ao, Xinwei, Datang and Jiandao, advancing to the suburbs of Nanning. At the same time, along the Yonglong Road, the Chinese army, with the speed of thunder and lightning, captured the cities of Longzhou, Mingjiang, Sile, and Suilu, striking at the enemy's rear. By the 28th, the encirclement was complete, and the Japanese had no choice but to abandon the provincial capital of Nanning, which they had occupied for a year, and break through to the south. On the 30th at dawn, the Chinese army on the Zheng Yong front and the Bin Yongwu Roads entered the city of Nanning. On the one hand, it dispatched strong troops to quickly cross the Yong River, and is currently pursuing the enemy in different directions. In the Guangdong area, more than a thousand Japanese troops in Dongguan, West Lake, and Shilong have been harassing Liangping Township (southeast of Dongguan), Yaowu (north of Shilong), Huangjiashan (east of Shilong) and other places in succession for several days, but were repelled by the Chinese army. On the morning of the 27th, the Japanese who attacked the vicinity of Pingshanxu from Longkou were also severely attacked by the Chinese army, and collapsed completely by evening.

Zhejiang and Anhui

In eastern Zhejiang, the Japanese who attacked Shaoxing from Xiaoshan were blocked and attacked separately, and the battle was extremely fierce. On the 26th, a part of the Japanese army entered the city. By dawn on the 28th, the Chinese army in the suburbs launched a counterattack against the Japanese, and attacked from the southwest and west gates at noon, engaging in street fighting with the Japanese.

After the Chinese army bravely counterattacked, the area has been recovered. After capturing Sanqiao west of Anqing, the Chinese army in central Anhui continued to pursue, successively capturing outer strongholds such as Lion Mountain, Duxiu Peak, and Ganlu Nunnery. The remaining Japanese fled to Anqing, and the Chinese are still attacking fiercely.

Shanxi and Henan

More than a thousand Japanese troops in Changzi in southeastern Shanxi harassed the northwest area of Shizhe Town again on the morning of the 27th, and were repelled by the Chinese army. Changzhi Japanese have also been constantly attacked by the Chinese army recently, and the Chinese army has captured quite a lot. The Japanese army in Lanche Town on the Jinbo Highway launched a counterattack on Gaojie on the morning of the 27th, but failed. The Japanese army, which invaded from Ruicheng and Monan Town in southern Shanxi, was severely attacked by the Chinese army. After a fierce battle until the 29th, hundreds of Japanese were killed. They are currently confronting each other in the Nan area of the mountains of the major and minor ditches. More than a thousand Japanese troops who invaded Xuehua Mountain from Yuxiang fought fiercely with the Chinese for four days, with casualties reaching more than 700.

The Japanese army in Luxian Qinyang and other places in northern Henan has been attacked by the Chinese army in successive days, suffering heavy casualties. On the 29th, a part of the Japanese army of more than 400 launched a counterattack towards Hancun, but was repelled by the Chinese army. In southern Henan, the Japanese army in the Xinyang area has been advancing on the west side of the Dabie Mountains in various ways in recent days. One road invaded Luoshan along the Xinhuang Road, one road invaded Yuelou from Wulidian, and one road invaded Zhutangdian from Dongbianhe Liulin and other places, all of which were repelled by the Chinese army in different ways.

Hubei and Hunan

More than a thousand Japanese troops in Guangshui, eastern Hubei, attacked Sanlicheng east of Wusheng Pass on the 27th, and many were killed by the Chinese army. More than a thousand Japanese troops in Suixian, northern Hubei, attacked the Zhangjiawan area in various ways on the 28th, and were defeated by the Chinese army. At the same time, more than 2,000 Japanese troops in central Hubei attacked Shuangfengguan Caodian and other places, and were defeated by the Chinese in the Baiyangjian Ganshengfeng area. The Chinese army on the opposite bank of Yichang also captured the Tianzipo highlands near Mojishan on the 28th. Although the Japanese are trapped in Yichang, they will no longer have a peaceful day. Japanese warships on the surface of Dongting Lake in northern Hunan repeatedly shelled the vicinity of Jiumazui Luxiwan Junshan and other places, attempting to land, but failed.

### Soviet Newspaper Reviews the Sino-Japanese War Situation

Chongqing: According to Moscow news, the Red Army's organ newspaper (Red Star Newspaper) recently published an article making a detailed review of the Sino-Japanese War, and included a newly drawn map for explanation. The newspaper stated that the Chinese army's victory in attacking the vicinity of Nanchang City and the active attack in Anhui gave the Japanese army a major blow. Fierce battles also broke out around Taihu Lake. The Japanese army's attempt to expand the battlefield in that area has failed. The article further stated the war situation around Nanning, saying that the Chinese command dispatched a large number of reinforcements and gave the Japanese side some blows. The Japanese side's hope to shorten the battle line can also be used as another explanation for withdrawing from Nanning. The article also mentioned the active situation of Chinese guerrillas on Hainan Island, an important Japanese strategic area in the south. In general, the retreat of the Japanese army from Nanning and the recent military operations in various places are all beneficial to China. (3rd dispatch)

### Female Hero on Hainan Island

Hong Kong: The 50,000 Chinese garrison troops are now in contact with the guerrillas, scattered in the interior of Hainan Island. One of the guerrilla teams is commanded by Ms. Liu Qiuzhu, who is armed with two guns in each hand. Ms. Liu is 35 years old, a member of the Communist Party, and has a beautiful appearance and vigor. She is indeed a heroine. Several of Ms. Liu's relatives died in Japanese air raids, so she vowed to capture the Japanese and be satisfied. However, on the other hand, the Japanese army has offered a high reward for Ms. Liu's head, because her night attacks on the Japanese army's outposts have caused great damage to the Japanese naval and ground forces.
