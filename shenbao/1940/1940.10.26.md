### Dutch East Indies and Japan Negotiations Stall, People Organize Air Defense

London - A correspondent for the free Dutch newspaper Batavia here announced today that experts report the main conference between Japan and the Netherlands Indies regarding the supply of oil has stalled. It is said that "the Japanese representatives firmly believe that Japan's current demands are based on expanding the power of the Tripartite Pact, while well-informed sources feel it is better to start with commercial negotiations. Therefore, the most important consultations have to be postponed." It is also said that the people of the Netherlands Indies are now organizing air defense. (United Press dispatch, 25th)

### Guo Taiqi Meets with British Foreign Secretary; Britain and the United States Intensify Embargo Against Japan; India to Assist China in Manufacturing Munitions with Scrap Copper; Australia Ready to Defend Democracy

London - Dr. Guo Taiqi, the Chinese Ambassador to Britain, met yesterday with the British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax and the British Secretary of State for Burma, Mr. Amery. It is widely believed that the content of their discussion concerned the issue of China purchasing scrap copper from India via the Burma Road. Observers point out that India has banned the transport of scrap iron to Japan this week. In addition, Britain and the United States are gradually intensifying the economic embargo against Japan. It is widely believed that the scrap copper from India, which was previously transported to Japan, may now be resold to China via the Burma Road. This scrap copper will greatly assist China's developing munitions manufacturing industry, as General Chiang Kai-shek's troops are now largely self-sufficient in rifles, machine guns, and munitions.

New York - Last night, the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Hu Shi, stated on a nationwide broadcast here to the New York Herald Tribune that China and Britain have joined forces in this decisive world war. Mr. Hu said that Anglo-Saxons now recognize that China and the Empire are fighting on the same side in the same world war. Even if the United States does not actually participate in this war, it will threaten the fundamentals of the United States. He also stated that Japan cannot provide military assistance to the Axis powers because Japan is deeply mired in the quagmire of China. China's three years of resistance have made Japan unable to freely or effectively assist its European allies, or to seize opportunities from the European war to plunder. Mr. Hu further stated that the United States holds the key to rescuing civil governance. If civil governance is to be victorious, the United States must also participate in the peace negotiations to maintain peace. It is reported that Ambassador Hu's speech is part of a systematic series of lectures he has been giving during his tour of the eastern United States this month. (United Press dispatch, 25th)

New York - The Australian Ambassador to Washington stated here last night to the New York Herald Tribune that Australia is ready to fight in the Pacific for democracy. He said that Australia and New Zealand are the democratic outposts of the Southwest Pacific and are ready to spare no effort to assist any joint forces defending democracy in this region. He said that Australia will soon have 250,000 armed soldiers and currently possesses sufficient weaponry and most of its defensive strength. (United Press dispatch, 25th)

New York - Former commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, Admiral Yarnell, expressed his views last night at a current affairs discussion at the New York Herald Tribune, saying that the only way to resolve the current world situation is to overthrow the military absolutism of Germany, Italy, and Japan. The military absolutism that currently dominates these three countries must be replaced by governments organized by people who understand honor and justice. The policy of appeasement has failed equally in both Europe and Asia. The United States must defend its main interests with force when necessary. (United Press dispatch, 25th)

Washington - Mr. Shem, a reporter for the U.S. Howard newspaper group, recently said that the rumor that the Executive Yuan plans to drop a bomb on Japan between now and November 5 has attracted the attention of some people. Many people believe that this bomb may have an equivalent effect, but they also believe that Japan will recognize that the U.S. election period is approaching, and that the U.S. warning is simply a threat issued to gain favor at home. (United Press dispatch, 25th)

Tokyo - The Chugai Commercial News stated in its editorial today that a war between the United States and Japan "caused by misunderstandings" is hopefully avoidable. The newspaper said that Japan and the United States should be careful not to adopt a hostile attitude, as this attitude would be sufficient to destroy their friendly relationship. The newspaper continued, "Recent news from all sides indicates that the United States is currently making 'intense preparations for war against Japan.'" If the United States provokes a challenge, Japan will not hesitate to rise up and deal with it. The newspaper claimed that if the United States can "correctly understand that the aim of the Tripartite Pact is not directed at the United States, then misunderstandings between the United States and Japan can be reduced. Unless the United States harbors evil intentions in the Far East, it is truly difficult to understand why the United States cannot understand this." A reporter for the Yomiuri Shimbun wrote that the pressure from Britain and the United States on Japan has actually become pressure from the United States. The newspaper said that the key to the Pacific problem lies with the United States, and whether there will be war or peace in the South Pacific countries depends entirely on the United States' decision. When the reporter discussed President Roosevelt's statement that he hoped to avoid the United States being involved in the war, he said that "Anyone can say anything during an election campaign, but no one can take it seriously."

### US Holds Important Meeting to Discuss European and Asian Situation; Secretary of War Stimson Issues Statement; Confirms Sending Aircraft to Reinforce Defense of Philippines

Washington - President Roosevelt met here yesterday with Secretary of State Hull to discuss the recent situation in the Far East and Europe. Afterwards, he immediately summoned the leaders of the two defense departments to the White House for a secret meeting. The two leaders were Chief of Staff of the Army General Marshall and Undersecretary of the Navy Patterson. The details of the meeting were not announced. Afterwards, the President's Secretary, Mr. Early, clearly stated that the President and Mr. Hull's discussion included discussions of the situation in the Far East and Europe. When asked if the President's recent diplomatic documents foreshadowed a serious development in Europe, Mr. Early replied, "You should look both left and right," clearly indicating that the documents studied by the White House relate to events in Asia and Europe. Secretary of War Stimson, Colonel, confirmed the news that some of the 110 aircraft originally made for Sweden but requisitioned by the U.S. government will be dispatched to the Philippines soon. He specifically pointed out that these aircraft are fighter planes, not training planes. Mr. Stimson said that this batch of aircraft will be used by two squadrons of the Army's air force, which will be transferred to the Philippines next month. Mr. Stimson believes that U.S. troops and civilians stationed in the Philippines must have sufficient defensive power. Some quarters believe that this statement implies that the United States will further strengthen its presence in the Philippines. (United Press dispatch, 25th)

Washington - Mr. Elizalde, a member of the Philippine Resident Commissioner here, told reporters that the United States should adopt a plan that is beneficial to the Philippine economic war, and that its national defense plan should be linked to the Philippines. Philippine goods are suffering economically because they cannot flow into the European market and because Philippine goods are priced low in the U.S. market. Therefore, the future economic defense of the Philippines should be carried out simultaneously. Mr. Elizalde criticized the low prices, the cost of transporting Philippine sugar to the United States, and the lack of oil tankers to ship coconut oil, saying that he will intensify negotiations with U.S. officials after the U.S. election. (United Press dispatch, 25th)

The United States is Planning

to Build a Great Air Force

Washington - The U.S. Army Department announced today that the United States is currently planning to create a great air force, with more than double the number of fighter planes it has today, and capable of exerting any effectiveness needed in wartime. According to this plan, the entire U.S. coastline and key points inland will have four major air districts and seventeen air stations, replacing the current four major air stations in the United States. It is said that this large-scale reorganization plan will give the United States a powerful fighter force of fifty-four squadrons, replacing all of the current twenty-five squadrons. (International News Service dispatch, 25th)

Washington - Defense Department officials said that the United States' major military raw materials have not yet reached the peak of the original plan, but they have passed the period of shortage. The United States' main military raw materials have always relied on the Far East. Officials now believe that even if the source of raw materials in the Far East is cut off, the United States can still carry out its national defense program without being hindered. The Defense Committee declined to publish the figures for reserves, but according to well-informed sources, the United States now produces or has substitutes for all types of raw materials in the Americas, so there is no need to worry. (United Press dispatch, 25th)

Roosevelt Broadcasts

Rebukes Dictatorship

Washington - President Roosevelt delivered a broadcast from the White House yesterday to the New York Times Annual Speech Gathering, saying, in brief, "We are now prepared to defend the Americas, North and South, and the oceans that are the highways of the two continents. Foreign propagandists want to alienate us with their terror tactics, but we have now responded with this preparation. We all know that dictators can quickly exploit the weaknesses of others. Foreign propagandists seem to believe that ample propaganda that democracy is outdated and that we are out of step can make us believe it to be true and corrupt ourselves. They think that we are no match for dictators. They must realize that they have made a mistake in observing our national character. The dictatorship forces everyone to obey and puts everyone in a state of terror, worrying about their neighbors and worrying about themselves, because the atmosphere everywhere is the atmosphere of a concentration camp. We are not like that. When we come together to decide on a major plan, we always follow this resolution, like shareholders, which is very different from the inhumane form of a master versus a slave. We are currently witnessing a careful test of the democratic system overseas. The people under democracy, regardless of men, women, old, or young, have shown unprecedented courage, unity, and strength under terrible attacks. Although their families, schools, churches, and temples have been destroyed, there is a great structure that cannot be destroyed, which is more durable than marble and more valuable than anything made by human hands, that is, the structure of democratic faith. Those who despise democracy and do not know our strength have already destroyed other free peoples and regard the United States as a democratic country with exhausted energy. Now, let us pay attention to the lively vitality of the democratic country. Lincoln once said, 'Justice creates power.' Let us believe in this statement and do our duty to the best of our knowledge."

### Willkie Broadcasts Speech Answering Political Opponent's Election Campaign; Located in Creek Harbor, Pennsylvania

Republican presidential candidate Willkie broadcast a speech on a train yesterday in response to President Roosevelt's election campaign. It is said that President Roosevelt soon forgot the promises he made in 1932. If he does the same with today's promises, then he fears that American youth will soon be placed on transport ships to foreign lands. Willkie also responded to President Roosevelt's claims of achievements in new measures, saying that after Roosevelt took office, national income decreased by 11 percent, industrial production decreased by 5 percent, agricultural production decreased by 20 percent, wages and salaries decreased by 21 percent, and company dividends also decreased by 32 percent.

### Rumor that Stalin Will Meet with Tatekawa Arouses Great Attention in Japanese Newspapers

Tokyo - Japanese newspapers today paid great attention to the news from Moscow and London that the newly appointed Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Tatekawa, will be received by Stalin on the 26th. According to the news, diplomatic circles in Moscow predict that the hope for an early conclusion of a Soviet-Japanese non-aggression pact is great. The "Miyako Shimbun" stated that the Japanese Foreign Ministry has not received any information about Tatekawa meeting with Stalin. The newspaper said that this development is extremely important because Stalin has not received a Japanese diplomat since 1929. The newspaper continued, "The meeting between the master of the key to Europe, who controls the Soviet Union, and Lieutenant General Tatekawa, who is known for his 'daring and decisive actions,' will certainly have extraordinary results, it can be asserted. In terms of the current world situation, it is natural for countries to look to Moscow." (United Press dispatch, 25th)

### Bullitt Strongly Advocates Aid to China and Britain; U.S. Protects Against Future Invasion; Must Prepare for War in the Future

New York - The U.S. Ambassador to France, Mr. Bullitt, stated here yesterday in a speech to the public that the atmosphere in the United States today is similar to that of France in 1938. At that time, although some people warned France of the danger, France was not aware of the danger, and as a result, it failed. Therefore, the United States must prepare for war now. If we are late, the Tripartite Pact is a clear warning from the dictators that the United States is the target for the future. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)

New York - Mr. Bullitt told the "New York Herald Tribune" yesterday that the establishment of a military alliance between Japan and Germany and Italy is a "clear alarm," indicating that the dictators of Germany and Asia have included the United States in the table of countries they plan to invade, and they have decided to invade the country. He urged Americans to help China and continue to urge the U.S. government to provide as much assistance as possible to Britain and China. (United Press dispatch, 25th)

According to reports, the first Monterey will arrive in Yokohama on the morning of October 30, the second ship, the Mariposa, will arrive in Kobe in mid-November, and the arrival date of the third ship, the Washington, has not yet been announced.

Editorial

### A Plea for Humanity

The myriad aspects of society and the world often cause those of us whose hearts are weak and consciences still exist to be heartbroken at the sight, unable to restrain ourselves from calling for the revival of humanitarianism! However, the world is rife with those who view humanitarianism as outdated and naive, who scoff at the mention of humanitarianism, or even escalate their inhumane actions as a response. How can humanitarianism be revived?

What is humanitarianism? It is the virtue endowed upon humankind by Heaven, and it is also the characteristic that distinguishes us from beasts. It does not discriminate based on nationality, creed, intelligence, strength, wealth, poverty, closeness, estrangement, gratitude, resentment, or benefit. It actively promotes universal love and passively adheres to non-cruelty. Furthermore, it extends its virtue to animals, so there has long been the practice of not bearing to see them tremble in fear before death and not bearing to eat their meat upon hearing their cries. Some even consider the act of holding chickens and ducks upside down as cruelty to animals, and impose fines and punishments as a warning. Thus, even oxen, sheep, chickens, and ducks can benefit from humanitarianism. But what have humans encountered? Aggressive artillery fire, and other atrocities that follow, are large-scale acts of inhumanity that run rampant across Asia and Europe, witnessed and heard by all, requiring no further elaboration. As for those who are displaced and left on the roadsides, exposed to the elements, freezing and starving to death, with ditches and ravines as their graves, their numbers are countless. In the major cities, such as Shanghai and Wuhan, it is said that there are many deaths from starvation due to grain shortages. Hubei Province itself is a rice-producing region, where rice is forcibly seized at a price of no more than ten yuan per stone, while in the markets of Wuhan, it cannot be bought for less than sixty yuan. In Shanghai, the price of rice is seventy or eighty yuan, making it difficult to secure a full meal even after a day of hard work, while in neighboring producing areas, it is only forty or fifty yuan. Those who engage in forced sales sell it even cheaper than this. As a result, in Shanghai, there have already been instances of people抢bing to fill their hunger and夺饭 to relieve their immediate needs. There have also been cases of people who have been blockaded and unable to find food, leading to their deaths. This is called the aftermath of war, this is called the wartime phenomenon, but is it necessarily inevitable? Those in power have never given a thought to humanity!

Moreover, with prices soaring, the means of making a living are becoming more and more urgent. With the north wind blowing, the pain of hunger and cold is converging. Those who have accumulated savings over the years have exhausted all that they had, while those who have nothing have built up mountains of debt, struggling on the brink of starvation, and wandering on the path between life and death. This is truly the greatest pain and the greatest tragedy in life. As for relying on relief to maintain a semblance of life, without donations, there can be no cooking fires. After three years of fundraising, the means have been exhausted, and those who wish to help are too busy taking care of themselves to spare any pity for others. Consequently, due to the natural consequences of the difficulty of life, the number of those who have fallen into destitution is even greater than before, and the number of beggars along the roadside is even more numerous. If the intention is to simply drive them away, then there will be too many to drive away. If the intention is to provide relief, then where will the funds come from? To let them wander and to watch them live and die without a second glance? Eventually, the bold and fierce will resort to looting and kidnapping, while the weak will resort to petty theft and fraud. The roads will be unsafe, and bandits will be everywhere, and there will be too many to arrest and too many to warn. Covered in sores and full of thorns, humanity is almost at its end!

Moreover, humanitarianism has no limits, no vastness it does not encompass, and no detail it does not attend to. Therefore, to say that humanitarianism is at its end is to deliberately extinguish it, or to destroy it unintentionally. It is non-human and non-humanitarian, and it is not truly at its end. Cruel acts unrelated to strategy or military affairs, which are unnecessary during war, are nevertheless carried out brazenly and taken for granted. The sin lies not in war but in inhumanity, so humanitarianism should not end because of war. Wartime international law has its prohibitions, but there are many loopholes. Today, even the major principles listed in public law are not respected by the 武者 [warriors, or militarists]. To speak of closer, smaller matters: there are those who are punished for crimes they did not commit, or whose punishment does not fit their crime. Directing traffic and maintaining order, those who violate these laws are fined or imprisoned, as stipulated in the law, and there is no escape. However, batons are used and whips fly, and those who are beaten are not responsible for their faults, and they are treated worse than oxen, sheep, chickens, and ducks. Petty vendors struggle to make a living and barely make ends meet. They shout themselves hoarse, but it is still difficult to make a living. To earn a meager profit, they may violate regulations or evade taxes. A slight rebuke to warn them not to do it again would be enough, but instead, their goods are thrown away and their persons are detained. Those who do not know the situation resent the harsh laws and the poverty and misery of life. In reality, it is caused by the malfeasance of the law enforcers, and it is also caused by the fact that when enforcing the law, they never gave a thought to humanity. Again, relief is a beautiful name, and shelter is a righteous act. All such public welfare and charitable undertakings, since they are named public welfare and charitable, should have their substance. Although there are those who follow the name and verify the substance, are there not also those who are perfunctory and use it as a means to make a living? Widows, orphans, the lonely, the elderly, the weak, the disabled, fleeing from war, are all the most unfortunate people in life, and it is also the last resort. Since they are to be rescued, they should be treated well, not as if they are in the hellish purgatory. Yet there are those who, though receiving relief, deeply regret not being able to live or die, not knowing gratitude but even swallowing their voices and weeping silently. Charity is originally a manifestation of humanity, and charitable undertakings should complement humanitarianism. To say that inhumanity exists under the guise of charity is absurd and perverse!

Non-human and non-humanitarian acts are everywhere, both far and near, both large and small. We believe that since they have become accustomed and habitual, they cannot be saved. We are unwilling to believe that in this day and age, humanity is at its end. How can we find those with compassionate hearts who, at any time and in any place, based on the people and matters involved, correct all perversions and promote general humanitarianism, leading by example and doing what they can? Then, to the extent of their power, there should be tangible results to see. Goodness, no matter how small, is welcome, and everyone can do good. There must be those who actually receive its benefits.

### Hitler Meets Pétain for Historic Meeting; Prelude to Formal Franco-German Collaboration; The Fate of France's Future

Somewhere in France: German Führer Hitler met with French Head of State Marshal Pétain for talks, which took place yesterday afternoon in the Führer's special train at a small station in the occupied zone of France. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and French Cabinet Deputy Laval were also present. Marshal Pétain and Laval arrived at the station by car. A battalion of the German army paid respects to Marshal Pétain. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, German Armed Forces Commander-in-Chief General Keitel, and German Foreign Intelligence Chief Doernberg welcomed Marshal Pétain at the station and led him onto the special train. Führer Hitler greeted him at the train car and then entered the Führer's private sleeping car for talks. After the talks concluded, the Führer personally escorted Marshal Pétain to the car, and a guard of honor paid respects and bid farewell. (25th Huitong News Agency Dispatch)

Vichy: An official communiqué released this evening stated that Marshal Pétain, accompanied by Cabinet Deputy Laval, went to a certain place in the German-occupied zone this morning at 8:00 AM and held a historic meeting with German Führer Hitler in a solemn environment. The meeting lasted for a long time and was of great importance. It was "tied to France's position and the fate of its future." When Marshal Pétain's entourage crossed the boundary between the free zone and the occupied zone, both French and German army units presented arms. Several German officers were also present to welcome them. (24th Havas Dispatch)

Berlin: A simple communiqué released here stated that Hitler met with French Prime Minister Marshal Pétain yesterday, and French Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Laval was also present. Hitler's meeting with Pétain was not only the first since the collapse of France in June, but also the first meeting between the two men in their lives. (25th Reuters Dispatch)

Berlin: It was announced here today that the German Führer met with French leader Marshal Pétain yesterday afternoon. Hitler's personal meetings with the heads of government of non-belligerent European countries have reached a climax today. Hitler conferred with Laval, and then with Pétain, so everyone was overjoyed to hear this news, believing that this was a prelude to formal Franco-German collaboration, and a cornerstone of the new European order established by the Axis powers, which could end the state of war between France and Germany. (25th Guojin Electric Dispatch)

Vichy: Judging from the commentary in various European newspapers and radio stations regarding the talks between Hitler, Laval, and Franco, the matter is far beyond our expectations. These commentaries all indicate that Hitler's diplomatic ambitions are far broader than generally speculated, stating that these talks are sufficient to show that Hitler wants to bring all European countries into the Axis, so that Britain will have no choice but to lift its blockade of the European continent or seek peace. Hitler's personal participation in the meeting shows the importance of the issues discussed. French observers, after integrating Italian views, stated that this meeting was to bring France closer to the Axis powers. These observers also explained the German opinion, saying that the talks were to rebuild Franco-German relations, so that the French government could return to Paris. (23rd United Press Dispatch)

Berlin: Senior German authorities are maintaining strict silence regarding the details of Hitler's meeting with Pétain. It is reported that the meeting was a constructive negotiation. Well-informed sources say that Germany has no intention of imitating the precedent of 1918. Germany is well aware of its responsibility to reorganize Europe and will look at the cooperation of various countries to increase their benefits. An official statement on the meeting is difficult to release. (25th Huitong Electric Dispatch)

Pétain Yields to Enticement and Coercion

France and Germany Will Sign an Agreement

New York: The "New York Times" carries a dispatch from Xiongcheng, stating that diplomatic sources suggest that Marshal Pétain, leader of the Vichy government, will immediately sign an agreement in Paris to cede certain territories. This agreement will allow France to stand on the same line as the Axis powers in economic, political, and military affairs without waiting for the conclusion of peace. People in Xiongcheng believe that the meaning of this agreement is undoubtedly to cooperate with the protection of the French fleet in North Africa, the Mediterranean, and the Atlantic bases, so that Italy and Germany can cooperate without obstruction from these bases to achieve their attempt to break through the British blockade. According to rumors in Xiongcheng, the conditions of the agreement that Pétain is preparing to sign are as follows: (1) Alsace-Lorraine is ceded to Germany. (2) The Riviera up to Nice is ceded to Italy. (3) France and Italy jointly rule Tunis. (4) France and Spain jointly rule Kolo. (5) The Syrian and North African French armies protect the flanks of the Italian army operating in Egypt. It is generally believed that the North African airfields (excluding equipment) are also included. It is said that the above conditions were rejected when they were submitted to Marshal Pétain, but after Deputy Prime Minister Laval made various arguments, such as saying that since Hitler had advanced to Paris, if France did not actively cooperate in resisting the blockade, it would be in danger of starvation, Pétain had no choice but to yield and agree to Laval's suggestion. It is reported that Foreign Minister Baudouin and Navy Commander-in-Chief Jianlan also supported Laval's suggestion. According to well-informed sources in Xiongcheng, if France accepts the above conditions, it will receive a corridor to Bordeaux and enjoy full administrative power as a reward. In addition, there will be the immediate release of prisoners of war and concessions in industry and economy. (25th Reuters Dispatch)

London: According to today's "Daily Express," the Axis powers have offered France generous and permanent peace terms through Hitler in exchange for privileges in all naval, land, and economic aspects. The newspaper also said that French Prime Minister Marshal Pétain has gone to Paris to sign a peace treaty with the Axis powers based on these terms. According to the newspaper, if France grants the following privileges to the Axis powers, the Axis powers will guarantee France substantial peace terms: (1) Germany and Italy occupy French naval bases, especially those in the Mediterranean. (2) Complete Franco-German tariff cooperation, allowing Germany to purchase French raw materials duty-free. (3) German and Italian troops pass through French Morocco and West Africa, so that the Axis powers can recover their pre-war colonies. (4) German troops are free to pass through any place within French territory in Europe. (25th International News Service Dispatch)

London: Yesterday, according to reliable sources, French Deputy Prime Minister Laval is requesting Hitler to reduce the scope of the German-occupied area of French territory. Laval's move is to avoid the danger of French inflation. It is reported that France currently has to pay 10,000 francs a day for the cost of the German occupation, which is much larger than what was imposed on Germany by Dawes or Young after the Treaty of Versailles.

External Developments of the Axis Powers

British People Pay Close Attention

London: A Reuters diplomatic correspondent said that the Axis powers' negotiations with France and Spain may not be the entire scope of Germany's recent diplomatic maneuvers. It is possible that the Axis powers in Italy are also making secret explorations in the East. It is well known that the Axis powers do not want to be bound by any measures, so that there is no obstacle if nothing is achieved. Therefore, the recent actions of the Axis powers have been kept secret, and the reasons are not difficult to understand. Today, there is no accurate information about the contact between Germany and French Deputy Prime Minister Laval and Spanish government leader Franco. However, no matter what form the German proposal takes, it has obviously been opposed by Vichy. Marshal Pétain, although easily deceived by his cunning politicians, can still maintain his position with a strong attitude for the sake of his reputation, which is very noteworthy. As for Hitler's sudden meeting with Franco, Hitler did not hesitate to travel five hundred miles by rail and condescended to seek advice, so it is conceivable that the issues discussed were important. It is generally believed that the Axis powers, having failed to obtain what they wanted from Spanish Foreign Minister Suhner, now want to obtain it from Franco. This is the purpose of Hitler's visit to Franco. Judging from the attitude of Italian newspapers towards recent developments, one can know that the Italians are as unclear about the truth as others. However, the Italians are also determined not to be ignored. For example, "Piccolo" stated that Germany, Italy, and Spain are fully cooperating, so Italy is also participating in the German-Spanish meeting in spirit, because the freedom of the Mediterranean is the reason for the unity of Germany, Italy, and Spain. (25th Reuters Dispatch)

London: People here today are paying close attention to the news that Hitler's mission to France is to sign a four-nation agreement between Germany, Italy, France, and Spain. According to rumors here, after the agreement is concluded, Germany and France will establish a customs union, but the main point is that France and Spain will join the Nazi's new European order. (25th United Press Dispatch)

Baudouin Makes a Speech

Saying France Has No Different Sound of Joining the War

Vichy: Last night, French Foreign Minister Baudouin told reporters that "France is no longer in a state of war, and France is moving towards peace." Local officials recorded Bao's words as largely refuting rumors, because recent foreign broadcasts have reported that France will join the Axis powers in combat in the short term. Pétain and Laval will arrive in Vichy this afternoon, and it is predicted that they will report the situation of their meeting with Hitler to the French people, and those who care about national affairs are waiting with anticipation. (25th Huitong Electric Dispatch)

Montreux, Switzerland: A report from Vichy in a local newspaper commented on Hitler's talks with Vichy Foreign Minister Laval, saying that there is no question of France colluding militarily with the Axis powers or giving the French fleet to Germany. Rumors that Italy is asking for Savoy are also untrue. (25th Reuters Dispatch)

London: According to a broadcast from the Hungarian capital's radio station, a Berlin dispatch from the Hungarian political newspaper said that the first result of Hitler's meeting with Laval will be the relocation of the Befu government to Paris. A Roman telegram from the newspaper said that special attention was paid to the situation in Syria during the meeting. (25th Reuters Dispatch)

It is Rumored that France Will Be for the Axis Powers

Launch a New Peace Movement

New York: According to information received here from Vichy, the Vichy diplomatic circles are now circulating a rumor that France may launch a new peace movement for the Axis powers. This rumor is related to the saying that Vichy Deputy Prime Minister Laval and Hitler will hold a second meeting in Paris. (25th Reuters Dispatch)

London: As a result of the talks between French Head of State Hitler and General Franco and Marshal Pétain, Spain and France may launch a "peace offensive proposal" to Britain, but Britain has preemptively rejected it from an authoritative source. Knowledgeable people in Britain said today that Germany's peace proposal through France is just a lure to make the French government completely controlled by the Axis powers. According to opinions from the political circles here, Hitler wants France to convey peace proposals to Britain, in order to exempt Pétain and his entourage from conscience when joining the Axis powers.

### Detailed Record of the Beginning and End of the Meeting Between the German and Spanish Heads of State

Madrid: This afternoon, further details were released here regarding the meeting between Hitler and Franco, stating that before 3:30 PM yesterday, Hitler's special train arrived at the Franco-Spanish border. Shortly afterwards, Franco's and his entourage's special train also arrived. The two exchanged greetings and inspected the German guard of honor. Hitler then invited Franco and Spanish Foreign Minister Suhner into his dining car, and the talks began at 3:38 PM. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop also participated. The meeting ended at 6:05 PM. The Spanish delegation then returned to Franco's special train to review and discuss the results of the talks. Half an hour later, the Spanish delegation returned to Hitler's train to continue discussions until after 7:00 PM, and a joint announcement was drafted in both German and Spanish. Thus, a major event in world history was initially announced. In the evening, Hitler hosted a banquet in his dining car for Franco and his entourage. German Foreign Minister sat to Franco's right, and German Army Commander-in-Chief Marshal Boeraucher sat to Franco's left. Hitler sat opposite Franco, and Spanish Foreign Minister Suhner and Spanish Ambassador to Germany Mondro sat to the right and left respectively. After the meal, Hitler accompanied Franco to the train. After the two shook hands and said goodbye, Franco's special train departed for Madrid. (25th Huitong Electric Dispatch)

London: According to information from neutral diplomats here in Madrid, Hitler's attempts to persuade Spanish General Franco to join the war and allow the Axis powers to use Spanish naval and air bases have failed. After Franco refused to join the war, Hitler also asked Spain to allow German troops to pass through to Gibraltar and Morocco, and to use Spanish ports and air force bases. It is reported that Franco refused because Spain lacks supplies of food, oil, and other important materials, making it difficult to risk being subjected to Britain's tightened blockade, unless the war can be resolved in a few weeks.

### British Launch Torpedo Planes to Attack German Convoy; Two German Supply Ships Sink in the North Sea; British Air Force Power Has Greatly Increased

London: Yesterday, the British Air Force used torpedoes to sink a supply ship in an enemy convoy off the Frisian Islands in the North Sea. The planes that went were Bristol Beaufort planes, which dropped torpedoes from high altitude. The German ship's lookout barely saw them. After the ship was hit by a torpedo, it exploded with a bang. The remaining ships and escort ships fired intense anti-aircraft fire. British aircrew saw a German ship of heavy four thousand tons sinking at the stern. Another German ship of two thousand tons also sank quickly. An American-made Lockheed Hudson-style British plane spotted an enemy ship outside Trondheim at night, dropped down, and strafed a ship from a height of one hundred feet, firing forty rounds. (25th Reuters Dispatch)

London: A Reuters Air Force correspondent stated that the British torpedo planes that were dispatched yesterday and sunk two German supply ships in the North Sea show that the British Air Force's offensive power and scope have now expanded. The British Air Force has paid attention to torpedo attacks for many years, but the announcement that British planes are carrying out torpedo attacks is the first since the start of the war. Now that we know that British aircraft have begun to use torpedoes to attack ships, it can be expected that they will be actively used not only off the coast of Europe, but also on the Italian shipping routes. Torpedo planes are indeed weapons that combine offense and defense, not only can they harass enemy convoys, but they can also assist the navy in protecting convoys beyond the range of fighter planes. More British planes continue to arrive in the Middle East, greatly increasing its defensive power. (25th Reuters Dispatch)

### Italian Aircraft Participate in Air Raids on Britain for the First Time; Rumor that Hitler Ordered a Change in Aerial Blitz Strategy; Possible Trial Use of Giant Airships for Bombing

Berlin – Italian Air Force bombed England for the first time yesterday. Italian and German planes took off from airfields in occupied territories and attacked various seaports on the east coast of the British Isles. According to senior authorities, Italy, hoping to directly participate in the war and achieve victory, dispatched aircraft to bomb the British Isles. (Hai Tong Telegram, 25th)

Berlin – German planes attacked London this morning, dropping many heavy bombs. German planes attacked various seaports in eastern England and industrial centers in central England yesterday. Five fires broke out in Birmingham. German planes continued to bomb London last night. (Hai Tong Telegram, 25th)

Berlin – This morning, this agency inquired with the military and learned that large formations of German planes departed last night to attack London. (Hai Tong Telegram, 25th)

London – An Air Ministry communiqué stated that German planes flew individually across the coast into Britain yesterday. Reports indicate that bombs were dropped in the areas of Kent, Hampshire, and Somerset near London. Detailed reports have not yet been received, but it is known that there was minor damage to residences and factories in the London area, with few injuries. Housing in one town in Hampshire was severely damaged, but casualties were minimal. Elsewhere, material damage and casualties were minor. Two German bombers were shot down by British planes yesterday, with no losses to British aircraft. A German bomber was also destroyed on Wednesday night. (25th)

London – The new strategy of German night raids over the past two nights has led London to believe that the German leader Hitler has ordered a change in the aerial blitz strategy. In this regard, London newspapers warned the public this morning that the Germans may use Zeppelin giant airships for attacks. The "Daily News" also issued a warning, stating that "winter weather is often poor," and that an attack on London by Zeppelin airships is worth trying, as German Zeppelins can rise above the rain and wind layers and each airship can carry 20 tons of bombs. The newspaper further stated that the low-altitude rain and wind layers would be the only protection for Zeppelin airships against British fighters and improved anti-aircraft barrage balloons. Meanwhile, British military observers said that although German planes intensified bombing last night and this morning (the air raid warning was lifted at 1:00 AM this morning, but the alarm sounded again shortly after), the German air raid tactics have changed. From this, it can be seen that the German side, due to the courage of the British people, which is more than enough to counter Hitler's terror air raids, is gradually abandoning such terrifying aerial blitz strategies. (International News Agency, 25th)

### British Royal Air Force Night Raid on Berlin

London – British Air Force heavy bombers made their 22nd attack on Berlin on Wednesday night, lasting two hours. Important targets in the city were bombed and set on fire. Two of Berlin's main power stations, namely the Berlin power plant in the Charlottenburg district and the Klingenberg power plant opposite the city center, were among the targets selected for attack by British aircraft. The large railway yards at Tempelhof, Pletzow Street, and Lilter were also attacked. On the way to the attack, the British aircraft encountered dense clouds, flew blindly, and arrived in Berlin after midnight. Intense anti-aircraft fire and searchlights inside and outside the city failed to prevent the British aircraft from attacking. The crew of one British bomber stated that they circled over Berlin for half an hour, flew past the outer fire net, and reached the target area, selected a position, and bombed. Several anti-aircraft shells exploded very close to the aircraft. The bombs dropped by the aircraft started a large fire, and other aircraft used the firelight to find their targets. According to the commander of the British aircraft squadron that attacked the central railway yard, other aircraft dropped flares, which the British squadron used to aim and drop giant bombs, which exploded ten to fifteen seconds later, starting fires everywhere. Another British aircraft made six passes over the Charlottenburg power station to ensure it was directly over the target before dropping its bombs. Six fires broke out in the bombed area. British aircraft also heavily attacked Emden twice, the second attack lasting an hour, dropping many tons of high-explosive bombs and hundreds of incendiary bombs on the railway yards and other targets.

### Axis Powers' Military and Diplomatic Strategies in the Near East: Plan to Give Asiatic Turkey to the Soviet Union as Compensation for Soviet Non-Intervention

Washington – According to information exclusively obtained by a reporter today, Germany has offered all of Asiatic Turkey to the Soviet Union as compensation for the Soviet Union's non-intervention in the Axis powers' advance across the Dardanelles to attack Iran and Suez. Diplomatic circles here understand that the Soviet Union is currently waiting quietly for the development of the meeting between the German leader and the Fascist leader before deciding whether to actively assist Turkey or passively assist the Axis powers, thereby eliminating Turkey from the map. It is believed here that one of the main purposes of the meeting between Hitler and French Prime Minister Pétain and General Franco is to position the French Navy alongside the Italian fleet, so that when the Axis powers launch a surprise attack on the Dardanelles, the navies of Italy, France, and Spain can control the British Mediterranean Fleet in the western end of the Mediterranean and the South Atlantic. Diplomats point out that this move will restrain Britain, preventing it from sending a fleet to defend Constantinople and the Dardanelles Strait as guaranteed in the British-Turkish mutual defense pact. Diplomatic circles speculate that if the Axis powers attack Turkey and Iran, and then turn to attack Suez, then Hitler has already made a decision with French Prime Minister Pétain regarding the future mission of the French forces in Syria. The U.S. State Department is unwilling to comment on the rumored German plan, but government officials point out that regardless of the Axis powers' strategies in the Far East and Near East, which are doing everything possible to change the situation, the U.S. policy of providing more and greater assistance to China and Britain will not be shaken. An authoritative source stated that the U.S. administration firmly believes that every military and diplomatic victory of the Axis powers will only add to resentment, and that the conquerors will eventually fall as a result. It is generally expected that this event will occur soon, as once the Soviet-Japanese Non-Aggression Pact is signed, dozens of elite Japanese divisions stationed in "Manchukuo" can rise up and attack China. Informed sources believe that this agreement is the goal that German diplomacy has been trying to achieve for months. Authoritative sources here reveal that the United States also anticipated this agreement, but the current friendly relations between the United States and the Soviet Union will not change as a result. It is generally believed that if Germany occupies the Dardanelles Strait, putting the Soviet Union in danger in the West, then the Soviet Union will be happy to accept the temporary exemption from Japanese attacks in the East. It is said that Asiatic Turkey will be given to the Soviet Union as a planned "gift," while European Turkey, including Constantinople, will fall under the control of a buffer state ruled by Germany.

### General慰勞Association Revises Donation Methods

Chongqing – The National慰勞General Association, in order to improve the methods of donation慰勞money from all sectors of the country, has newly revised five methods, and telegraphed to compatriots across the country for attention. The original telegram said, since the establishment of this association, under the leadership of the central government, it has handled national慰勞affairs, deeply grateful for the enthusiastic support and enthusiastic donation of compatriots at home and abroad, and this association has been able to do its best for the soldiers in the front and their families, which is very inspiring. However, in the past, compatriots from all walks of life have found the procedures for remitting donations to be somewhat simple, resulting in considerable difficulties in handling them. For example, funds remitted to this association are only remitted from banks, and it is not stated in the remittance that it is a慰勞donation, and there is no letter to explain whether it is an individual donation or a group collection, and it is difficult to understand. As a result, after this association receives this donation, it is often inconvenient to immediately cash it because it cannot be accounted for, and it takes time and effort to inquire in many ways, which inevitably delays the matter. In order to effectively correct this, five points have been revised. It is hoped that compatriots at home and abroad who donate money will pay attention to them. (1) When donations are remitted from the bank, please send a separate letter of explanation. (2) Please state the nature of the donation and whether it is for a specific purpose in the letter. (3) Please also state in the letter whether the funds are donated by偭人, a group, or collected. (4) If receipts for donations need to be issued separately, please attach a detailed list of donors. (5) If someone is designated to be handed over to the front, please also explain in detail. This association will issue receipts for all donations received, regardless of the amount, and will also publish a public notice every three months regarding the receipt and expenditure of donations. The situation will be compiled into a credit record. Compatriots from all walks of life should give guidance to the work of this association. If there are any questions, they should be answered in detail. This is hereby telegraphed, and I hope you will understand. (Telegram, 24th)

### White Russians in North China Issue Notice

Tianjin – The North China White Russian Anti-Communist Committee recently issued a notice to White Russians in various parts of North China, stating roughly that in view of the ongoing war in China and the unstable international situation, all residents of East Asia are forced to accept a new economic system in order to survive. White Russians in North China are no exception. From now on, we must advocate frugality and refrain from extravagance. All kinds of ceremonies, such as weddings, funerals, and birthday celebrations, should be simplified. Those who dare to knowingly violate this will be severely punished. In addition, the committee also announced revised White Russian tax regulations, stipulating the following tax increase measures: (1) The ordinary income tax is divided into three types, A, B, and C, and all tax rates are increased by 50%. Type C tax stipulates that those with a monthly income of more than 100 yuan will have their tax increased by 100%, and those with an income of less than 100 yuan will be exempt from tax. (2) The White Russian Education Fund surcharge remains the same, and the amount of collection should first be approved by the local anti-communist committee. (3) White Russians who send their children to schools in the United Kingdom, the United States, and France should pay special surcharges separately. (4) The income tax rate for unmarried White Russian men and women without family members should be doubled. (5) White Russian women who marry or cohabit with foreigners should pay special surcharges separately. (6) The tax payment period is from the 1st to the 10th of each month. Those who delay payment will be fined according to the amount of their tax. Those who are in arrears for one month will be fined 50%. Those who are in arrears for more than two months will be fined 25% per month starting from the second month. (Havas News Agency, 23rd)

European War Commentary (23)

### Romania's Two Monarchs, Old and New: Michael and Carol

Since the German army entered Romania, the situation in the Balkans has become urgent, and Southeastern Europe has once again become a troubled region. Romania's territory, after being divided by Soviet Russia, Hungary, and Bulgaria, respectively, into Bessarabia, Bukovina, Outer Transylvania, and Southern Dobruja, has changed from a leaf resembling a begonia to a long-necked goose. Let's not talk about this. The former monarch Carol II was originally a dissolute and romantic emperor in Europe. When he was passionately in love with his mistress Madame Lupescu, his father King Ferdinand asked him, "Do you want the throne, or do you want the woman?" He replied without hesitation, "I want the woman." As a result, his son Michael inherited the throne before him in 1927. In 1930, Carol returned from his travels and forced his son Michael to abdicate, then found a way to have Parliament recognize him as the legitimate king, and then ascended the throne under the name of Carol II. Ten years passed uneventfully. In early September of this year, he abdicated due to his submission to the Axis powers' arbitration at the Vienna Conference, ceding most of Outer Transylvania to Hungary, causing resistance from the Iron Guard. Thus, Michael was restored to the throne. In name, he is a new monarch, but in reality, he is a returning prodigal son.

Michael is nineteen years old this year, born on October 25, 1921. He has been very intelligent since childhood, and his body is quite strong. At that time, his grandfather Ferdinand was the king, and the palace naturally regarded him as the supreme. However, all real power was wielded by his grandmother Queen Marie, who was beautiful, intelligent, and ambitious. In addition to Michael relying on the protection of his grandparents, he also had the care and education of his loving mother Helen, so his early education was very satisfactory. Unfortunately, his father was fond of alcohol and women, abandoning his family and neglecting his flesh and blood, privately dallying with an outsider, and abandoning Michael's mother invisibly. Later, mother and son were separated for ten years and could not see each other. These were all the "immoral" acts of his father.

After the death of his grandfather King Ferdinand, Michael was only six years old, and he ascended the throne at a young age. Of course, he did not fully understand all national affairs, but he and his mother were quite loved by the people, and the relationship between the upper and lower levels was harmonious. There was a great sign of good governance. He began to study at the age of eight, and he was not confined to the palace, allowing him to live a solitary life alone, but mixed with the children of commoners. Moreover, many classmates, both male and female, were present. During playtime, rich children and poor children played together regardless of class. His companions included the fierce daughters of soldiers, university professors, merchants, and farmers. It can be said that there were all kinds of people. Therefore, Michael came into contact with people of all classes from an early age, developing a habit of being amiable and humble.

During his school days, Michael spent most of his time outdoors in addition to studying indoors. He was a Boy Scout and liked various sports. His hands did not resemble those of a noble family, but he always liked to work and was busy non-stop. Everything active, such as hunting, riding horses, driving cars, and repairing machines, he was tireless in his enjoyment. Although Michael had a very strong personality, he was naturally happy, treated people kindly, and his every move was full of vigor. He loved and possessed all the games that healthy young people liked, their cheerful and sincere emotions. All his classmates and teachers were very close to him.

Before the breakdown of Carol's feelings with his family, he also tried his best as a father to his son. He often brought Michael to public places. They were almost always together on Sundays for worship, at Parliament meetings, when visiting foreign heads of state, when receiving foreign guests, and when interacting with domestic politicians. Michael was handsome in his youth, and in all places, he could show his outstanding and profound style. The Romanian people added scholarship to this prince.

Since the relationship between Carol and his family went awry, and the feelings between husband and wife became like ice and charcoal, and they lived apart, Michael, who loved his mother deeply, always had to go abroad every year to visit her. The people of the country unanimously recognized his actions as filial piety worthy of praise. Michael still maintained considerable feelings for his father. However, according to general rumors, Michael was very displeased with the courtiers and favorites in the palace, and as a result, he expressed sympathy for the "Iron Guard," which was organized by a group of young people who sought to rebuild Romania with a revolutionary spirit.

Now this child Michael has ascended the throne for the second time. The first time was because his father abandoned the position of crown prince, and Michael was the King of Romania for more than two years. This time it was because his father abdicated that he ascended the throne for the second time. The difference is that in 1927, Romania was prominent and powerful, known as "Greater Romania," but now it is in a state of national crisis, with its land broken, and has become a vassal state of another country. He was formerly guided by three regents, but now his "boss" is a "stone-hearted" dictator, General Antonescu.

Even so, the King of Romania is still an important figure in Eastern Europe. If a dictator does not have a political party as a backing, his life will not be long. The throne is longer-lasting by comparison, and the dictator naturally has to rely on it a lot. At present, King Michael and General Antonescu follow the Axis powers' policies as the leader of the horse. They obey Hitler's orders, just like the rest of the oppressed people of Europe. Of course, they are now in a position where they have no other choice but to take the path of the Axis powers, there is really no other way to think of it. (To be continued)

(Kunming Airmail) Ding Ji, chair of the Department of Commerce at Southwest Associated University and newly appointed director of the Institute of Economics, tragically drowned in an accident while swimming at Dapuji Village on October 4th. His remains were not recovered until the 7th. His younger brother immediately prepared a coffin for the burial. It is rumored that cremation will be used for the funeral arrangements, and discussions are currently underway. Furthermore, Ding's friends and various academic groups will discuss memorial methods in the coming days. Jia Pu, one of Ding's top students, has written an article titled "In Memory of Mr. Ding Ji," detailing his life. It is recorded below:

Research Work Ding Ji was a native of Minhou, Fujian, 35 years old, and unmarried. In the year of the "September 18th" Incident, he returned to China with a master's degree from Harvard University in the United States. He taught at Nankai University in Tianjin, dedicating himself to his work, enjoying the company of others, and teaching tirelessly for nine years. After the July 7th Incident, he followed the university to Changsha. In the spring of that year, Qinghua, Peking, and Nankai Universities were ordered to relocate to Yunnan after forming the Changsha Temporary University. The Departments of Law and Commerce went to Mengzi for classes, and Mr. Ding Ji followed, serving as the chair of the Department of Commerce. After class, he devoted himself to local rural economic surveys and visited Gejiu. In the past two years, he published numerous papers on the tin mining industry in Gejiu. In August of the same year, the two departments moved back to Kunming for classes. The Kunming office of the Nankai Economic Research Institute was established by Mr. Ding Ji and others through painstaking planning, and its scale was gradually established. From then on, Mr. Ding Ji devoted himself to the study of Yunnan's industry and economic problems. Today's "Review and Publication" was managed by Mr. Ding Ji. Mr. Ding Ji was also involved in collecting and compiling economic data for the "Committee for the Collection of Historical Materials on the Sino-Japanese War," which was jointly organized by the Peking Library and Southwest Associated University. In the 28th year, he concurrently served as the director of the Kunming office of the Southwest Economic Construction Research Institute. In January of this year, the Yunnan branch of the China Southwest Industrial Association invited Mr. Ding Ji to edit the monthly "Yunnan Industrial Newsletter." The Yunnan Economic Problems Discussion Group, jointly organized by the economic academic community, had 72 members, and the affairs were led and presided over by Mr. Ding Ji. This year, the English version of the Nankai Economic Research Institute's "Quarterly Journal of Economics and Society" was relaunched, and Mr. Ding Ji's article "China's Emerging Industries in the War of Resistance" was praised by readers at home and abroad. The data compilation for the article "Yunnan's Road Transportation" was just completed, and "China's Industry Before the War of Resistance" was still in progress. A small comfort in the grief is that Mr. Ding Ji's English masterpiece—China's Transportation and Transport Since the War of Resistance—took half a year and was completed a week ago. Mr. Chen Xujing shook hands with him that day to congratulate him. Who knew that it would be the last farewell to a long-time friend?

Circumstances of the Accident At around 9:00 AM on the 4th, Mr. Ding Ji took ham, swimming suits, etc. to Wenlin Street and invited Mr. Zhang Dechang to walk to Dapuji (previously agreed upon with Mr. Zhang). They arrived after 11:00 AM and had lunch at Mr. Wang Guoxing's, director of the Livestock Improvement Institute of the Yunnan Provincial Construction Department, after 12:00 PM. During the meal, he drank a glass of locally brewed new wine. After 2:00 PM, Mr. Wang, in the midst of his busy schedule, accompanied Mr. Ding Ji and his wife to a small mountain lake about two miles from the institute for swimming. The lake was six or seven fathoms deep and thirty or forty yards in diameter. Surrounded by small mountains, Mr. Ding Ji changed clothes and entered the water. Before he could swim a full circle along the shore, he happily came ashore. The second time, he decided to wear glasses and do a backstroke, intending to swim from this shore to the other. When he had swum three-quarters of the lake's diameter, he suddenly cried out, bent over, and sank. At this time, Mr. Wang Guoxing, seeing this, bravely entered the water to search and hired villagers to help, but to no avail. It was not until 4:30 PM on the 6th that a dozen Nankai students who were good swimmers swam to the deepest part of the lake but still could not find him. According to their speculation, Mr. Ding Ji was unable to support himself due to cramps and did not swallow water before sinking, so he could only wait for him to float up on his own.

Spirit Mr. Ding Ji's spirit of being rigorous in learning and doing things was undeniable. Nine out of ten of the male and female students who graduated from the Department of Economics and Commerce this year were introduced to various organizations by him, regardless of his hard work. Many banks were unwilling to accept female graduates, and Mr. Ding Ji did his best to introduce them. His spirit of service left indelible marks at Nankai and Southwest Associated University. He won the admiration of thousands in the academic community, but before he could make greater contributions to the War of Resistance, who could not feel regret and sorrow?

We, the younger generation who are left behind, can only take Mr. Ding Ji's words and deeds as a lesson, be self-vigilant, self-motivated, and rush to the thorny future to repay our teacher's kindness and comfort his spirit.

### Yin Qian Cup Ping Pong Match Si Ming Wins Against Chinese Middle School; Shanghai Easily Defeats Guangdong

In the Yin Qian Cup Ping Pong Match, last year's champion Si Ming team suffered at the hands of North America due to incomplete personnel, which has some impact on the future of the championship. The team fought against the strong Chinese Middle School team again yesterday at the Chinese Ping Pong Room. The director, Gui Weimin, also came out to preside, and the morale was greatly boosted, which was very different from the previous battle. The score rose sharply, showing its champion qualities again. The Chinese Middle School team was not weak, but the generals entered the arena with slightly less experience, so they were defeated by Si Ming. As a result, Si Ming defeated Chinese Middle School by a large margin of 13 to 5. In another battle, the ever-victorious Shanghai team defeated Guangdong 13 to 7, maintaining its undefeated record. There are two matches tonight. The results of the previous night and the schedule for tonight are recorded below.

### US Navy Personnel and Dependents Scheduled to Leave Shanghai; Over Two Hundred People to Depart on November 1st; American Nationals From Various Locations Arriving in Shanghai to Await Ships

It is expected that the dependents of the regular US Navy and Marine Corps personnel currently stationed in Shanghai will withdraw from Shanghai before mid-November. According to the news released by the US Navy authorities in this city, 150 dependents of Navy personnel and 70 dependents of Marine Corps personnel are scheduled to depart on the Manson Steamship Company's Monterey on November 1st. The remaining 110 dependents will leave Shanghai on the President Pierce, President Coolidge, and President Taft, all three of which will arrive here before November 15th and set sail immediately.

Reserve Personnel

Dependents Also Evacuated

In addition, a number of American nationals residing in Shanghai who are in the Naval Reserve have recently been summoned to the US Navy's Asiatic Fleet. There are approximately 20 people serving on gunboats in the Yangtze River Patrol Fleet. Once the necessary arrangements are completed, the US Navy authorities will also send all the dependents of the reservists who have been called to active duty or are about to be called away from Shanghai.

Women and Children From Various Locations

Arriving in Shanghai to Await Ships

Over thirty American women and children arrived in Shanghai yesterday from various inland locations. They had all purchased return tickets to the United States in advance. Most of them will bid farewell to their second hometown, where they have lived for the past two or thirty years, within a week. Furthermore, a number of American nationals who are about to evacuate and return to the United States are expected to arrive in Shanghai from Dalian today. It is reported that recently, every few days, five or six to over ten American nationals have arrived in Shanghai from inland locations, preparing to wait in Shanghai for ships to return to the United States.

Furniture Shipping Costs

Calculated at Half Price

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury" stated that the American President Lines announced this morning (the 25th) that the shipping costs for furniture and other items for American nationals evacuating and returning to their country on the company's ships will be reduced from US$30 to US$15 per ton, effective until December 31st of this year. Other American ships coming to the East to assist in the evacuation of American nationals, except for the Monterey, will also halve furniture shipping costs. However, for passengers who are not evacuating American nationals, the shipping costs for furniture and luggage will still be charged according to the old rates.

Four Thousand Five Hundred

Tickets Sold

At the same time, American nationals who are about to evacuate are purchasing tickets from the President Lines. According to company personnel, an average of fifty tickets are sold per day, and to date, over four thousand five hundred advance tickets have been sold. A considerable amount of money is still needed, so the Association hopes that all sectors will actively donate and complete the collection and payment procedures as quickly as possible before the 31st of this month. However, various industry associations, schools, and groups that have not yet participated in the winter clothing donation movement should not miss the opportunity to serve and should rise up in unison within a short period. There is no shortage of people participating. It has expressed concern about Malaysia's rejection of volunteers and has appealed to the British Embassy. It is also rumored that Ge Bo, who resigned from his position as Deputy Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council to join the army, was also

Rejected in Singapore

He wrote a strong protest to Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the British Ambassador to China, and then went to India at his own expense to join the army. Mr. Ball, who previously worked as a messenger at the British Assessor's Office in Shanghai, and Mr. Glover, an inspector at the Shanghai Municipal Police Department, went to Hong Kong after being rejected from joining the army in Singapore and are serving as lieutenants in the Hong Kong Naval Reserve. It is also rumored that the British Army recruitment office in this city has temporarily suspended sending volunteers to Malaya.

Money Sent to Shaw

British Air Force Association

The Royal Air Force Association held a weekly meeting at noon yesterday on the top floor of the HSBC Bank on the Bund and bid farewell to founding member Shaw. Shaw is the general manager of the British China General Omnibus Company and will leave Shanghai at the beginning of next month to join the Royal Australian Air Force. All founding members attended yesterday's weekly meeting. Sir Sassoon, the chairman, was absent due to business and was represented by Captain Holland. In his speech, Holland first recounted the history of the establishment of the Royal Air Force Association and expressed his deep admiration for Shaw's joining the Royal Australian Air Force. Shaw then replied with thanks. At that time, the members also presented Shaw with a silver plate as a souvenir.

### Final Week for Donating Winter Clothing Funds

Only 300,000 Yuan Has Been Collected

A Large Discrepancy From the Subscription Amount

The movement to collect winter clothing funds in this city began in August. Since the Shanghai Collection and慰勞 Funds Collection Committee promoted the collection to all sectors, various industry associations, schools, and groups have deeply understood the righteousness and actively participated, and individuals have also generously donated. It has been two and a half months so far. As of today, the amount collected and remitted to the central government by all sectors is only close to 300,000 yuan. There is still a large discrepancy from the original subscription amount and the doubled target. Do not imitate the behavior of those who pretend to be deaf and dumb, which is despised by the people of the country. Furthermore, the National Winter Clothing Collection Association telegraphed that Shanghai originally only subscribed for 500,000 yuan, but now it has reached 1 million yuan, exceeding the quota by more than double. This is because the collection association reported to the National Winter Clothing Association that it would do its best to raise the doubled amount of 1 million yuan from all sectors in Shanghai. This is not the actual amount of 1 million yuan in winter clothing funds that Chongqing has received from Shanghai. Therefore, the association has been urgently promoting and urging all industries in recent weeks and hopes that all industry associations, schools, groups, and fellow compatriots in the city will fulfill their greatest donation obligations in this final week to comfort the soldiers and refugees and achieve satisfactory results.

### British Nationals Volunteering to Go to Singapore Mostly Rejected; British Nationals in Shanghai Feel Indignant Upon Hearing the News; However, Those Who Went to India Were All Satisfied to Enlist

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury" reported that news was recently received from Singapore that a group of British nationals who left Shanghai on September 22 to volunteer for the army in Malaya were mostly rejected. British nationals in Shanghai felt indignant upon hearing the news. According to letters from these British nationals who volunteered, the British authorities in Singapore

Rejected the Majority of Volunteering British Nationals

Only allowing them to serve as policemen in the Malayan Police Force. Only one or two of them were willing to join the police force. The rest could not join the British Army and planned to return to China. The son of Mr. Woodhead, editor of the "Oriental Affairs" magazine, was also among those rejected. Unable to fulfill his desire to join the army, he took a job at a newspaper in Singapore. It is reported that a total of 58 British nationals left Shanghai on September 22 to join the army, 28 of whom went to Singapore and 30 to India. Judging from their letters, it seems that they all have

Satisfactorily Enlisted

The British Embassy and the British Army recruitment office in this city were surprised to receive news of Singapore's rejection of volunteers and are now planning to take concrete action. Employees of Jardine Matheson and other British companies in this city who resigned to join the army,

### First Day of Bitter Cold Seventy-Four People Frozen to Death; Yesterday Morning's Temperature Was 39.9 Degrees Fahrenheit; Climate Will Warm Up After High Pressure System Passes

A high pressure system from Siberia followed closely behind a low pressure system and advanced rapidly towards the Yangtze River basin. The vanguard has already reached this port. The temperature has dropped sharply, and the northwest wind is howling. At dawn yesterday morning, the temperature dropped to 39.9 degrees Fahrenheit, setting the lowest temperature record for this year, resembling the dead of winter, which is rare in autumn. According to the Xujiahui Observatory's prediction, this cold wave will generally pass in a day or two, and the weather will return to warmth. However, due to the extreme cold, there has been a sudden increase in the number of corpses frozen to death on the streets. There were deaths on Zhizhong Road, North Henan Road, Yunnan Road, Qipu Road, etc., which was quite tragic. According to the statistics of Pushan Villa, on the first day of bitter cold in the city (the 24th), the number of corpses frozen to death on the streets in the Public Concession was 26 adults and 48 ownerless children, totaling 74. There were also three cases of frostbite, who were sent to the hospital for treatment. Those who were frozen to death have all been buried in coffins. However, since the cold turned, infectious diseases have been greatly reduced. True cholera has also disappeared in the past week. However, due to the relationship between sudden cold and heat, there are more people suffering from colds and coughs. In terms of overall health and hygiene, the cold weather has been quite effective.

### Residents Continue to Die in the Japanese Blockade Zone in Western Shanghai; Reportedly, Part of the Blockade Was Lifted Yesterday; However, the Situation Is Bleak Due to a Lack of Food in the Area

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury" reported that the Japanese authorities have restricted the 4,000 residents of the Jessfield Road area in western Shanghai from entering or leaving for nearly a week. Only today (the 25th) has part of the blockade been lifted, allowing workers to leave this blockade area to go to work. However, two alleys are still blocked and monitored by Japanese military police and "city police." According to Major-General Bavin, Chief of the Shanghai Municipal Police, the police department received news today that the restrictions in the blockade area have been relaxed since yesterday (the 24th).

Continuing Deaths

Today, there are continued reports of residents dying in the blockade area. In the past few days, a total of eight to ten residents in the area have died of starvation. It is also reported that the Japanese authorities in western Shanghai are continuing to register Chinese residents in the western district of the Public Concession, aiming to implement a joint guarantee system. It is reported that the Japanese authorities implemented the blockade after the murder of Japanese military police sergeant Saito Seiichi in the western district last week and have successively arrested Chinese people, totaling over 200 to date.

People Vanished

Also, yesterday, the blockade remained in place at Qianjia Lane, No. 668 Difeng Road, the Jessfield Road overpass, No. 189 Kaina Road, Tianzhuang on Yuyuan Road, and Yanjiazhai on Jessfield Road. A team of armed "city police" (more than ten people) patrolled there, while three armed "city police" were stationed at Qianjia Lane. When reporters looked inside from Difeng Road, they saw no one in the lane, and the situation was bleak. According to nearby residents, residents inside the lane are still prohibited from going out, and pedestrians outside the lane are not allowed to enter. The only concern is that the residents have run out of food. If there is no outside relief, they may starve to death. Transportation is still using inter-district buses, but the Route 20 trolleybus can drive directly to Zhaofeng Park.

The meeting began at 3:00 PM and adjourned at 3:30 PM. According to the attending representatives, this was a routine meeting.

On the afternoon of the previous day, at around 1:00 PM, a Japanese man named Taguchi Shigeki, residing at 202 Qiujiang Road, claimed to have 2,000 bags of cement, priced at 24,400 yuan, and sold them to Hou Tucai of Dechang Brick, Tile, Lime, and Stone Company, who lived at the same address. He forged a transaction order as if the goods were stored in a certain warehouse and fraudulently obtained 24,400 yuan in Japanese military scrip. He took refuge in the French Concession and spent more than 2,500 yuan. He remitted the remaining 20,000 yuan to a bank in Hankou, intending to escape on the 5:00 AM plane on the 23rd.

Two Machine Factories Robbed in Japanese Military Blockade Zone, Robbers Occupy for Four Hours, Total Loss Exceeds 20,000 Yuan. The Daye Chinese-English Typewriter Factory, located at No. 7, Lane 1221, Yuyuan Road, and the Huguang Machine Factory, located at No. 6, are adjacent to each other. In the early morning hours, when all employees of both factories were asleep, six robbers suddenly broke into the Huguang Machine Factory by climbing over the wall. They brandished pistols, drove the workers into a room, and confined them. Then, they dismantled various machine parts, carried them out through the main gate, loaded them onto a "tiger cart" (handcart) that had been waiting at the entrance, and hauled them away. Before long, the cart returned after unloading the goods, and they carried out two loads, emptying the Huguang Factory of its large machinery. The robbers then climbed into the adjacent Daye Typewriter Factory. Because the machinery there was specialized for making typewriters, the robbers abandoned taking it, only looting one large and one small motor, as well as four dan (approximately 400 liters) of raw material steel and white rice. They loaded these onto the original tiger cart and left with a whoop. As they left, the robbers also stole several hundred yuan in cash from the safe in the factory's accounting room. The losses of both factories amounted to more than 20,000 yuan. The robbers occupied and looted the two factories for about four hours. Such boldness is rarely seen. Chief Clerk of the Higher Court's Third Branch, Deng Keyu, Nearly Kidnapped; Deng's Whereabouts Still Unknown. Deng Keyu, a native of Hubei and the chief clerk of the Third Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court, enjoys a good reputation in the judicial circles and is extremely honest. His Shanghai residence is located at No. 4, Lane 103, opposite the Loujiawan Police Station on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession. Unexpectedly, at around 2:00 PM on the previous day, two individuals of a certain nationality, leading several Chinese men, went to Deng's residence, conducted a major search, and attempted to kidnap Deng. At that time, Deng was out. They waited until late at night without seeing Deng return home, and then they left. However, Deng's whereabouts are still unknown. Murder of a Lodger Occurs in the Shenzhou Hotel; Before Death, He Bought Wine and Food, Laughing and Talking Merrily; Tragedy Occurs in the Quiet of the Night; Strangled in Bed. At the Shenzhou Hotel, located east of Xiaocai Market on Zhejiang Road, a lodger was found strangled in room 401 on the fourth floor the night before last. The victim was a young man in a Western suit. The details are as follows: Two Men Check into the Room. On the previous day (the 23rd), at around 1:00 PM, two lodgers checked into the Shenzhou Hotel at 159 Zhejiang Road. They were led to a large double room, No. 401 on the fourth floor, which cost 13 yuan per day. They paid 15 yuan in national currency and filled out the registration book with the name Liu Junli, 30 years old, from Shanghai, wearing a snuff-colored flannel suit and leather shoes. The following afternoon at 2:00 PM, three or four friends came to visit, dressed in various styles, including long gowns and short jackets. At around 4:00 PM, they called a waiter to bring wine and food, talking and laughing naturally. A Game of Mahjong Not Yet Finished; Tragedy Occurs. Not long after, they ordered mahjong tiles and played the game all night. Around 10:00 PM, the night shift tea boy, Hua Jingshan (from Suzhou), number 42, noticed that the room was silent, dark, and without light. He opened the door to investigate. Unexpectedly, the room was empty. Only a set of mahjong tiles was placed on the table in the outer room, in a chaotic state. Later, he discovered Liu lying on the bed in the inner room, covered with a cotton quilt. He went to the side of the bed and looked closely, seeing that Liu's feet were bound with hemp rope, his hands were tied behind his back, his neck was tightly strangled with hemp rope, half an inch deep, and his mouth was stuffed with cotton. He felt that his limbs were already cold, but his suit and leather shoes were intact. Family of the Deceased Still Under Investigation. In a state of panic, he reported to the front desk, who in turn reported to the Zhabei Police Station. Chinese and foreign detectives rushed to investigate. The body was transported to Renji Hospital by hearse and then to the morgue for examination. However, Liu Junli's real name could not be verified for the time being. It was determined that he had been brutally strangled to death, apparently due to a vendetta murder. According to reporters, Liu had mostly associated with people of lower social classes during his lifetime. The police are currently investigating the deceased's family in Shanghai and searching for the escaped murderers to bring them to justice. Fraudulent Schemes Involving Fake Companies; All Accusations of Guarantee Money Fraud Are Filed; Yesterday, the Case Was Proposed for Trial and Judgment for Compensation; Plaintiff Imprisoned and Appealing. Qi Renzhang (29 years old this year), a local resident who had previously committed fraud and was sentenced to six months in prison, was released on December 14th last year. Not long after his release, he and Gao Jishi, Wang Shaotang, Yu Changqing, Lin Qingmin, Zheng Yifei, and others jointly organized an organization to forge and sell "Passes" and "Citizen Certificates" issued by the Japanese army for travel in occupied areas, to defraud people of money. The forgery organization was located at 630 Avenue Edward VII, managed by Gao Jishi and Lin Qingmin. They also falsely established the China Trust Company and China Transportation Company at No. 514, 5th Floor, Cishu Building, Nanjing Road, with Qi as the manager and Zheng Yifei as the assistant manager, specializing in selling forged "Passes" and "Citizen Certificates." They had no goods, no capital, and on January 12th of this year, they used the name of the China Trust Company to publish advertisements to recruit employees with a monthly salary of 40 yuan. A man from Yixing named Xu Dexie, 59 years old this year, had been working at the Yixing County Chamber of Commerce. Because his hometown was occupied, he brought his family to Shanghai to take refuge. He saw the advertisement and went to apply. Qi stated that anyone who wished to work at the China Trust Company had to pay a guarantee deposit of 400 yuan. Due to financial difficulties, Xu only paid 300 yuan. Qi issued a receipt and urged Xu to raise the full 400 yuan. Xu had no choice but to raise another 50 yuan and give it to Qi. Qi said that this amount would be treated as a loan until the full amount was paid, and then a receipt would be issued. From then on, Xu worked for Qi, unaware of the forged passes and other matters. In the summer of this year, Qi and Gao Jishi, Wang Shaotang, Yu Changqing, and other organizations were raided by the Public Concession Police. A large number of forged "Passes" and "Citizen Certificates," as well as 14 forged Japanese seals, were seized. Xu was also regarded as an accomplice of Qi and was sent to the First Special Court's Criminal Division, which sentenced Qi Renzhang and Gao Jishi to two years each for jointly using fraud to induce others to hand over property. Wang Shaotang, Yu Changqing, Xu Dexie, and others were sentenced to one year and six months each. Because Xu was a victim, he disagreed with the court's judgment and hired Lawyer Zhou Kun to appeal to the Higher Second Branch, seeking redress for his grievance. The investigation is still ongoing. Xu also hired Lawyer Zhou Kun to file a complaint with the Civil Division of the First Special Court, accusing Qi Renzhang, Zheng Yifei, and others of defrauding him of his guarantee deposit and requesting a judgment ordering the return of the guarantee deposit and the 50 yuan loan. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, Judge Wu opened the Second Civil Court to hear the case. The defendant Qi Renzhang was escorted to court by several Chinese police officers. He admitted to defrauding the guarantee deposit. Judge Wu verified the evidence and announced the conclusion of the trial. The court ruled that the defendants Qi Renzhang, etc., should jointly and severally compensate the plaintiff Xu Dexie for the 300 yuan guarantee deposit and the 50 yuan loan. Copper Ingot Theft Case, Defendant Returned to Custody, Investigation Extended; Defendant's Request for Bail Denied. The case of Swiss citizen Weitler stealing copper ingots worth 2 million yuan from the Ruifeng Transportation Company's warehouse, the Public Concession Police Department had already detained the Ningbo natives Zhou Maofa and Zhuang Zixiang, who were in charge of the warehouse, and the German Huier Haipengte, and sent them to the First Special Court for detention, all of which had been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Qing presided over the Criminal Court No. 8 to continue the hearing. The police lawyers Fang Fushu and Qian Xunjiu requested a further two-week adjournment because the investigation procedures in this case had not been completed. The lawyers hired by the defendants requested that bail be granted during the adjournment. The court ruled that the case would be adjourned for two weeks and the defendants would remain in custody and bail would not be granted. Also, Tony, the lawyer for Changshi Pengte, had previously requested the court to allow Pengte to be released on bail. The judge said that a formal written request for bail was required, but Tony did not state yesterday that he would submit a written request on behalf of Pengte. Using a Japanese Soldier's Business Card to Intimidate a Female Student; Reported to the Police and Arrested. Zhang Zhiyuan, a local resident, from the 22nd to the 24th of this month (the date of his arrest), colluded with the fugitive Zhang Ying to continuously use intimidation to extort 500 yuan in national currency from Zhang Gengqing (a female student at Datong University), who resided at 850 Seymour Road. Li Jinxuan, Zhang's accountant, reported this to the police, who arrested him. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Criminal Court No. 3 of the First Special Court and prosecuted for the crime of intimidation. The police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated the case, saying that the defendant and the fugitive both knew that the victim Zhang Gengqing's father, Zhang Zhensheng, was an architect currently in Kunming. The defendant and others falsely used the business card of Inada Matsumoto, a Japanese soldier of the Yuyuan Road Japanese Army Department, to intimidate Zhang, falsely claiming that the Japanese army had discovered that Zhang's father had a close relationship with the Chongqing government in Kunming, and instructed Zhang to quickly pay 500 yuan to resolve the matter. Otherwise, they would either kill her or burn down Zhang's Shanghai residence. Zhang also agreed to pay. Yesterday, the defendant went to Zhang's house to collect the money, but Zhang's accountant saw through the deception and reported it to the police by telephone, who arrested him. The police requested a postponement to investigate the defendant's relationship with the Japanese army, etc. Judge Huang verified the identity of the defendant and ordered him to be remanded in custody for further investigation. Architect Sues Concubine for Cohabitation. Lu Weiyue (35 years old, local), an architect residing at No. 9, Lane 119, West Khukee Road, recently hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the Second Special Court's Civil Division against his concubine Hua Xiuzhen (20 years old, Suzhou native, currently residing at No. 19, Xinhua Village, Lagena Road), seeking cohabitation and confirmation of the guardianship of their biological son. It is stated that the petitioner took the defendant as a concubine in the 27th year of the Republic (1938), and they had a harmonious relationship since they began cohabiting. Recently, the defendant suddenly became bewildered by someone's words and acted strangely. On June 29th of this year, while the petitioner was out, she packed up her belongings and fled without a trace, taking her young son, Xiaodidi, with her. The petitioner found her and persuaded her to return home. At that time, the defendant was already pregnant and requested to be sent to a hospital for delivery before returning home. She then gave birth to a boy in the hospital, named Xiaodidi. Despite repeated urging to return home, she refused. It is stated that the defendant, being a member of the family, should legally return home to cohabit and seek a permanent common life. Moreover, it is inappropriate to allow Xiaodidi and Didi to be separated from the petitioner's guardianship, which would hinder their education. Upon receiving the complaint, Judge Yang Delin of the court opened the Second Tribunal yesterday to summon the two parties. Both parties arrived with their lawyers. As a result, both parties agreed to a settlement, with the following conditions: (1) The defendant is willing to take Xiaodidi back to raise him. (2) Didi will still be raised by the petitioner. (3) The petitioner agrees to pay a monthly living allowance of 60 yuan and a rent allowance of 30 yuan, starting from November of this year. (4) All of the defendant's previous furniture and clothing will be returned by the petitioner. (5) The petitioner agrees to pay 300 yuan for living expenses before November of this year. (6) Both parties are allowed to cohabit. A settlement record was made in court. After the court adjourned, both parties left the court hand in hand, laughing and talking. Youth Association's Junior Department Holds "Filial Piety Month," Tomorrow is Parents' Day. The Junior Department of the Christian Youth Association believes that China is known throughout the world for filial piety. Since ancient times, there have been countless stories of filial piety, such as the Twenty-Four Paragons of Filial Piety, which are known to all women and children. At a time when new and old morals are clashing, teenagers neglect and despise the way of filial piety, disobey their parents' wishes, waste money, and there are cases of parents and children breaking off relations, children leaving without saying goodbye, and even unethical events. In order to strengthen morality and promote filial piety, October is specifically designated as Filial Piety Month. In addition to lectures and discussions in various small groups and advocating the way of filial piety, various filial piety gatherings are held to enable teenagers and their parents to participate. It is also stipulated that the last Sunday of October each year will be designated as the first Parents' Day, with tea and refreshments provided, as well as musical performances and gifts of appreciation (self-created). In order to concentrate the work, the following central tasks are set for each month: January: Aspiration Month, February: Competition Month, March: Friend-Making Month, April: Discussion Month, May: Labor Month, June: Health Month, July: International Month, August: Outdoor Month, September: Fellowship Month, October: Filial Piety Month, November: Service Month, December: Youth Month.

Yesterday's spot gold market saw an increasingly severe decline, due to the sharp rise in foreign exchange, causing weakness in investor sentiment and widespread selling. The market was extremely quiet, unlike in the past. The initial morning market was relatively stable, with a maximum of 5,745 yuan. It was reported that a certain money exchange firm had purchased 400 taels of spot gold for immediate delivery on behalf of a certain firm, with the price gradually diverging from futures by over 20 yuan. By noon, the market was sluggish, falling to 5,625 yuan. The afternoon market saw little fluctuation due to limited trading. The closing price was 5,670 yuan, a sharp drop of 90 yuan compared to the previous day. Total trading volume was only over 1,000 taels. Jewelry gold also decreased by 10 yuan, while customs gold remained flat. Spot Gold Sharply Down by 90 Yuan. The foreign exchange market opened relatively flat in the morning, and investor sentiment was relatively stable. Gold and silver firms traded 10 taels at 5,740 yuan, as the opening price. Shortly after, it rose by 5 yuan to 5,745 yuan, with a silver firm purchasing 20 taels from a money exchange firm. At this time, the foreign exchange market was reported to be rising, causing a decline in buying interest. Money exchange firms and securities firms sold, and the price broke below the 700 yuan mark, with a money exchange firm trading 10 taels at 5,680 yuan. Not long after, a silver firm traded 10 taels, increasing by over 10 yuan to 5,695 yuan. Unexpectedly, near noon, the foreign exchange market weakened further, and securities firms continued to sell continuously, eventually falling to the 5,600 yuan mark. A securities firm sold 10 taels to a money exchange firm at a low of 5,625 yuan. At the noon closing, a certain silver firm purchased slightly, rising by several tens of yuan, with a silver firm trading 20 taels at 5,677 yuan as the noon closing price. The afternoon market was quiet, and trading decreased. A money exchange firm traded 10 taels at 5,675 yuan.

Mumbai dispatch, India silver spot and futures are both small, 5 annas. Market situation is still solid, with 50 transactions total. Yarn and Thread: Lack of Actual Sales; Prices Rise Wildly and Fall Easily The thread market, which had seen gains in the afternoon of the previous day, experienced a situation of initial rise followed by decline yesterday. This was because actual transactions gradually decreased, and the number of threads cleared by Hong Kong brokers was considerable. The temporary suspension of transactions in previous days was also expected. Therefore, colleagues and factories gradually disposed of Double Horse factory orders. However, general speculation saw purchases at low prices and sales at high prices. The demand for chips remained enthusiastic, and the volume of transactions on the market was still outside of 5,000 bales. Under these circumstances, the market remained turbulent. Shenxin Factory opened 1,000 bales of 20-count Double Horse yarn at a price of 1,280 yuan, current factory orders. Spot Yarn Expands: In the afternoon of the previous day, bulls were very active, and prices had been raised to 1,290 yuan. The market was filled with voices saying that prices would rise further. The opening price was 1,292 yuan, and buyers were very eager. Soon after, the price reached 1,298 yuan. Unexpectedly, as prices rose, those who stirred up trouble came out to sell. However, the struggle between the two sides was very fierce, and prices fluctuated between 90 yuan and 87 yuan for quite some time. Later, it was heard that spot sales were not smooth, and the exchange price was flat and weak. Investor sentiment turned lax, and the price fell to 1,279 yuan. The total number of transactions on the market was 5,875 bales, and prices fell by 10 yuan. Also, 2,620 pieces of cotton yarn will be shipped to Hong Kong today (the 26th). The amount purchased by each bank is listed as follows: Hong Kong: 305 peers, 5,560 Wenzhou: 10 statistics, 5,875. Foreign Cotton Trading More Active: Rough Velvet Prices High and Sales Slow. The situation for current cotton is still firm, and cotton merchants have good intentions. However, the price of rough velvet cotton has risen too sharply, and factories are unwilling to risk buying it. As a result, business is slightly slow. White Loke Qu: 244.00 peers bought 300 pieces Pingguo Er: 176.00 and 200 pieces Brazilian Cotton: 292.00 and 200 pieces Changshu Mozi: 230.00 and 200 bales Taicang Cotton: 206.00 and 200 bales Olmra: 137.50 and 100 pieces. In addition, the market price of foreign cotton is quiet. Later, due to the weakness of Wall Street and the closing of some bulls, the closing price fell by 1-2 pounds compared to the previous day. India's price yesterday, including forecast, fell by one rupee. The Shanghai Foreign Cotton Trade: Due to the difficulty of transporting overseas raw cotton to Shanghai, all parties are concentrating on spot cotton transactions. In addition, the inventory in the market is not abundant, so the goods in the hands of various colleagues have long been bought up by the factories. Recently, there have been few foreign cotton chips on the market, so cotton prices have only risen and not fallen. Grains: Rice Prices Still Falling Although the price of foreign rice fluctuated yesterday, the result was still a downward trend. This is because the accumulated inventory is increasing, new arrivals are endless, and actual sales are weak. Stockpilers have stopped buying, and it is difficult for the market to turn around. In addition, foreign firms are promoting Saigon rice, with No. 2 rice priced at only about 72 yuan, which is nearly 2 yuan lower than the previous day. Therefore, investor sentiment is even more pessimistic. The opening price in the early market immediately fell sharply by 1.35 yuan. In the afternoon market, some floating households took advantage of the small absorption, and actual sales also picked up slightly. The market once rebounded to nearly 1 yuan. However, in the afternoon, some large households and profitable bulls sought to exit, and new stockpilers and actual sales were stagnant, so the market fell again. The final closing price was still about 1 yuan lower than the previous night. Total transactions were less than 4,000 bags, and no agreement was reached on the return of original bags and new transactions. Although the arrival of new japonica and kiln bran wild rice is rare, only 1,000-2,000 shi, the sales floor was constrained by foreign rice, and only the early market was active before turning lax. Therefore, the selling price can be called a fixed price. Except for kiln seeds, which alone increased by 1 yuan to 76 yuan due to lack of goods, the remaining new japonica was still 75 yuan to 73.5 yuan, the original bag was 77-78 yuan, wild rice was 79.5 yuan and 79 yuan, Yangdu sharp original bag was 70 yuan and 69.5 yuan, and broken japonica also lacked changes, similar to the previous market. The supply of domestic glutinous rice has been cut off for a long time, so although sales have been sluggish and the appetite of wine households has declined, it has still been able to hold steady without changing. However, the market for foreign glutinous rice is abundant, so it followed the price of foreign rice and fell by 1 yuan. Kaitet was 73 yuan, Juezhi was 70 yuan, and Nuolu was 66.5 yuan and 66 yuan. Sales to visitors were quiet. Flour Prices Loosening. Flour Yesterday's spot flour market continued to loosen. This is because the supply from factories has been increasing frequently, and guest stockpilers have stopped buying and started selling. Because the sales to guests from the North and South are quiet, the goods that have already been packed are still being returned. Therefore, the tense situation of the past few days has disappeared. The two factory systems released a total of more than 10,000 bags, all of which were handled by local streets and rural villages. The rising trend of foreign flour has also subsided, and the price has loosened from 19.40 yuan to 19.10-12 yuan, which is 2-3 jiao lower than the previous day. As for the factory system of China, it is still at the original price of 17 yuan. There is no market for domestic flour and Japanese factory flour. Wheat Yesterday's market was as quiet as ever. Arrivals from various places have been scarce for a long time, and factories are not eager to buy. Because Japanese factory flour is banned from being transported to the concession, and sales of Chinese factory flour to guests are sluggish, factories are indifferent to the need for raw materials. Except for wheat arriving nearby that is directly delivered to Sanxin Factory at a certain price, market transactions remain unheard of. Securities Internal Debt Meanders The stock market continued its weak performance yesterday. The morning saw greater fluctuations, while the afternoon was relatively stable. The financial community continued to sell, with conflicting news, leaving investors in a state of confusion. Wild rumors had a significant impact on the market. In the morning, Hongda covered short positions, Tongkang added long positions, and Lianhe and Lianyi also made significant gains. Initial prices were very small, followed by a 7-8 jiao increase. Later, Yuxing sold hundreds of thousands, and Shunchang, Yitai, Datong, and Jiufeng also sold, returning to a decrease of 2-3 jiao. The market fluctuated unpredictably. In the afternoon, the market initially stabilized due to purchases by Tiansheng Lianhe, followed by continued sales by Yuxing, and Hongda also sold a large amount. Prices fell again. Later, Lianyi and Lemao bought, and the market rebounded slightly, but the final result was still a decrease of 1-4 jiao. The total number of transactions was about 2.2-2.3 million yuan. A brief table is listed below: Category High Low Closing Change from Previous Day Unified A 67.80 67.60 67.60 Down 0.15 Unified B 62.20 61.70 61.80 Up 0.10 Unified C 58.60 58.35 58.40 Up 0.4 Unified E 59.55 58.90 59.10 Up 0.20 50 shares of Sanyou Industrial Company stock were traded, priced at 21.60 yuan. London, 24th (Thursday) dispatch, market prices for Chinese foreign debt and Far Eastern British merchant stocks remained flat. Only bank stocks fluctuated slightly. The price of Macquarie Bank shares fell by 2 shillings and 6 pence to 6 pounds and 17 shillings and 6 pence. HSBC Bank's British-registered shares rose by 1 pound to 62 pounds. Hong Kong-registered shares remained unchanged, still at the original price. The rest were also unchanged. Miscellaneous Grains. Soybean transactions not many. Tianjin and Qingdao sources continue to arrive. Soybean trading is still active, but the transaction volume is not strong. In recent days, soybeans from Tianjin and Qingdao have still been arriving steadily, so the

### British Scholar Arrives in Shanghai from England, Discusses the Impact of the European War After One Year (Part 2) - Describes the Impact on the Far East

British Air Force

British affairs were not initially limited to defense alone. Their bomber squadrons returned nightly with good news, reporting on the bombing of German shipyards, factories, and oil depots. Thanks to the superior training of pilots and the excellent design of aircraft, the British Air Force was able to realize its mission of hindering the preparations and production of the aggressors. By the end of September, Britain had completed a new batch of aircraft, further enhancing the superiority of the Air Force at the front. With the increased strength of the Air Force, they can continue to destroy German industry. We shall see if they find this more unbearable than the last Great War. The ease with which the British Air Force could bomb made the Germans realize that Britain was not limited to defense alone.

On the Mediterranean Sea

The most suitable time for invasion has passed with the tides of September 18th. What follows are storms, and although there may be relatively calm weather in October and November, it is generally unsuitable for navigation. If the plan to directly attack England is extended to the Mediterranean, Britain's position there is very weak due to France's defeat. As Tunis became a target of war, Libya was constantly threatened from both sides. After surrendering, Italy's valiant garrison focused all its efforts on Egypt, forcing British convoys in Salonica to retreat. However, Italy's advance towards Alexandria only penetrated thirty-six miles into Egypt, and as the weather grew colder, the difficulties inevitably increased. Nevertheless, the passage of time gives Britain the opportunity to increase manpower and materials. The British fleet still holds dominance of the Mediterranean, and all transportation arrives in Alexandria without loss. The territorial army has ample time to complete its training in Egypt. Although England is constantly subjected to German air raids, Britain can still equip its Near East forces with the latest equipment. In fact, even the older batch of aircraft is sufficient to compete with Italy. Germany's only success was occupying Somaliland, which the British military saw no need to defend, and now it is only garrisoned by a small Italian force.

Discussing the Balkans

The Axis powers are now attempting to force Spain to join the alliance. If this happens, after the capture of Gibraltar, it is hoped that the western end of the Mediterranean can be blocked, and Italian reinforcements can directly pass through Morocco without risking attack by the British Navy. By utilizing the Adriatic naval ports, Germany could also establish a base in North Africa. However, Spain is very cautious, as they have seen the behavior of German and Italian troops on their territory before. In the Balkans, Romania's subjugation has resulted in Germany gaining control of oil fields and Italy threatening Greece. It is clear that the Tripartite Pact concluded by Germany, Italy, and Japan is nothing more than a new anti-communist agreement. Therefore, Britain's firm stance against the aggressors is greatly admired and sympathized with in the United States. People throughout America have come to understand that supporting this old world's bastion of freedom is a matter of utmost urgency. The voices of isolationists have effectively died down, and even the presidential election is being promoted on the basis of national defense preparations. The belief that the United States would not participate in the war is gradually disappearing. In the face of Nazi aggression, the United States has also quickly caught up, planning its own defense.

The Far East

Regarding the Far East, Germany, in disappointment, no longer flirts with the Chinese government, nor does it restrain Japan. It expresses concessions to Japan because it hopes to shift America's attention from the Atlantic to the Pacific. However, Japan's foreign trade almost entirely relies on the United States and Britain, so it still has to consider this carefully. In conclusion, it can be seen that extreme nationalism is contrary to a sound economic system, but aggressive countries probably won't accept this moral lesson. The deeper they sink, the more they will try to forge a path they believe will lead to safety, until they fall into the most distressing situation. At that time, a revolution will inevitably occur throughout the society. Germans often talk about revolution against plutocratic politics, but what is happening now is a revolution of democratic nations against threats, deception, and aggression.

### The Shanghai Municipal Council Staff Resign in Succession, General Manager Nash Also Scheduled to Leave Next Year, The Largest Number of Resignations are from the Police Department

The English-language "China Press" reports that almost every day, staff members of the Shanghai Municipal Council submit their resignations, and the number has become quite large to date. Some of them are leaving their jobs to enlist in the British army, while many others are resigning purely for commercial reasons. In recent days, the most prominent staff member to resign is the British national Nash, General Manager of the Shanghai Municipal Council. Nash has worked for the Municipal Council for twenty-five years, also serving as the spokesman for the Council. He will formally leave the Municipal Council next spring and plans to move to the United States with his family. Many believe that the current Assistant General Manager Gregg will be promoted to fill Nash's vacancy, assisting another Deputy General Manager, Allen. Nash and Allen were both promoted to Deputy General Manager after the former Deputy General Manager, Creber, resigned. In 1915, Nash served in the Shanghai Municipal Council's General Manager's office, rising through the ranks. He has held the current position of Deputy General Manager since September 15 of this year. Nash was proficient in sports such as soccer in his youth, and his family has resided in Shanghai for a very long time. In addition, the Municipal Council announced yesterday that another twenty people have resigned, including twelve from the Police Department, four from the Health Department, two from the Education Department, and one each from the Finance Department and the Fire Department. Investigations show that the Police Department has the largest number of resignations.

The USS Guam will return to Shanghai tomorrow afternoon (the 26th, i.e., today) and will still be berthed at the Bund in the French Concession.

### Rice Prices Continue to Decline

The overall food supply in Shanghai is gradually stabilizing due to the increased domestic and international sources, and people's minds are relieved. Speculative rice merchants have undoubtedly suffered a serious blow. According to investigations, rice stocks in warehouses have increased by more than 100,000 bags compared to last week, and the spot goods in rice shops have also increased sharply. If the more than 200,000 bags of imported rice that have already been traded arrive in Shanghai, rice stocks in warehouses will increase even further. Since the opening of the rice market yesterday, the market has become increasingly stable. Imported rice continued the downward trend of the previous day, falling by about one yuan. The current demand for spot goods is sluggish.

### Anniversary of National Savings for National Reconstruction

The National Committee for the National Savings for National Reconstruction Movement was established on November 11th last year, and its first anniversary is approaching.

All sectors of Shanghai have also decided to respond to this movement, and a National Savings for National Reconstruction Propaganda Week has been scheduled to publicize the significance of saving for individuals and the nation, and to awaken all Shanghai citizens to participate in order to promote production and construction, and to complete the great task of national rejuvenation.

### Court Police Officers of the Second Special District Request Increased Compensation

The guards, watchmen, and court clerks of the Local Court of the Second Special District, since the cost of living in Shanghai has risen sharply, have been granted a monthly subsidy of 20 yuan by the Ministry of Judicial Administration. Now, because prices have been rising steadily for half a year, it is still difficult to make ends meet. The guards and watchmen, therefore, stated the reasons to the warden yesterday and requested preferential treatment. The court clerks also requested the President of the Court and the Chief Prosecutor to forward a request for a salary increase, which has been submitted by the respective officials and is awaiting a reply before it can be resolved.
