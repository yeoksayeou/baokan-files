### Completion of Far East Red Army Reform, Prepared to Deal with Any Contingency. The U.S. Also Plans to Send the Navy to Cruise the Pacific to Ensure that Officers and Soldiers Will Not Be Isolated in the Event of War

Moscow – Military officials here stated yesterday that the Soviet Union's Far East troops are now prepared to deal with any contingency. It is reported that since the recent abolition of the political commissar system, military and political reforms have been completed after consultation between the Communist Party and major units. At the meeting, General Pupkov, commander-in-chief of the First Far Eastern Army, praised the army's strong combat power. He said, "Our army has a terrible strength, and we are very proud of it. We are especially proud of the tradition of Khasan (note: Khasan was the site of contact between Soviet and Japanese forces in the Nomonhan Incident from 1933 to 1939). We are now strongly united, obeying the orders of our beloved leader Stalin, and ready to fight at any time. We are prepared to deal with any most difficult situation and eliminate the enemy." General Stein, the current supreme commander, said that the Soviet Far East Army "should be familiar with the experience gained from modern warfare." (United Press dispatch, 8th)

Moscow – At a meeting of the Far East Front Military District yesterday, General Pupkov, commander of the First Red Banner Army stationed on the Far East Front, declared, "We are prepared to start fighting temporarily and are prepared to defeat any enemy under any circumstances." General Stein, commander of the Far East Front, analyzed the Red Army's preparations, explained the shortcomings, and asked commanders and political workers to study the experience of modern warfare, saying, "The current situation urges us to work harder to complete the Soviet military power." Another military conference was held in Moscow, where the head of the political department stated that given the international situation, the Red Army must be prepared to follow the orders of the Party and the government at any time to protect the interests of the socialist motherland.

Washington – According to unconfirmed reports here yesterday, following the U.S.-Australian Pacific defense talks, officials have begun to study the possibility of sending the navy on a goodwill cruise to the Pacific. If this cruise is implemented, the Philippines, Singapore, and Australia will be essential stops. The broad meaning of the cruise is to reassure the Pacific region and disappoint aggressive countries. In a narrow sense, there are countless reasons: (1) to demonstrate the power of the United States Navy; (2) U.S. visits to British territories are sufficient to show friendship with Britain; (3) to familiarize U.S. naval officers and soldiers with all military ports and other facilities, so that they will not be isolated in the event of war. Sources in communication channels said that the matter has not yet been definitively decided. Whether this matter is implemented depends on the environment in the near future. In other words, it depends on the policies of Japan and the Dutch East Indies, and the status of Britain in the Atlantic. Since acquiring 47 new training ships, the United States has been able to operate in Hawaii. Naval personnel recalled that Captain Knox once said that a goodwill visit to Australia is a very good method. Other officials have repeatedly advocated holding such a cruise and should include the Pacific region. (United Press dispatch, 8th)

London – The Daily Mail predicted today that the U.S. neutrality law will not last long.

U.S. Government Officials Are Discussing Plans for Economic Aid to Britain

Washington – A dispatch from a U.S. news agency in Washington stated that it is now known that government officials are discussing plans to provide financial assistance to Britain. The plan is divided into two points: (1) Britain must use its funds invested in the United States to purchase military supplies; (2) The United States may agree to grant Britain a loan when Britain's investment in the United States is exhausted. Those in power believe that Britain has sufficient financial resources to purchase military supplies in the United States for one year or more. However, they want to know where funds can be obtained after one year. It is said that the British side believes that Britain needs to be promised future loans for the following three reasons: (1) to support British morale; (2) to plan the purchase of military supplies in the long term; (3) U.S. manufacturers can rest assured that they will be able to expand factory equipment and accept British orders if they know that future payments are guaranteed. Discussions in Congress and elsewhere have focused on asking Britain to designate gold bonds and West Indian assets as loan guarantees. According to local sources, Britain's assets in the Americas and the Far East can be included in the loan conditions. Because Britain must have a kind of additional guarantee product, so that the American people who have not forgotten Britain's last war debt welcome loans to Britain. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)

Cambridge, Massachusetts – Harvard University Professor of Political Science, Iliot, yesterday advocated expelling the German and Italian consuls stationed in the United States and limiting the number of Japanese and Soviet consuls to a minimum. He also stated that the most superior strategy for the United States at present exceeds: (1) clearly issuing a warning that if Japan attacks Singapore or the Dutch East Indies, the United States will definitely respond; (2) expanding the Monroe Doctrine to include neutral Ireland and escorting convoys to Ireland by navy; (3) periodically paying for the profits of British asset mobilization at market prices and accepting the position of shareholder in the resources of the British Empire; (4) repealing the neutrality law.

U.S. Warships Are Modified to Defend Against Air Raids

Washington – Naval Secretary Knox yesterday requested Congress to allocate $3,000,000,000 to modify warships so that they can more effectively deal with air raids. Captain Knox said that the defensive engineering on the ships is confidential and cannot be disclosed. However, he also said that war equipment and combat experience are part of the defensive needs. It is generally known that unofficial sources say that the Navy Department had previously planned to install multiple anti-aircraft guns on the ships, believing that this is a more effective method of air defense.

### Weekly War Situation, December 1st to 7th

In Hubei, the Japanese army, on the eastern front, launched an offensive from Maping, Xihe, and other places in Suixian County towards Lishan. Another force advanced from Zhongxiang towards Changshoudian and other places in the western foothills of Dahong Mountain. The Japanese army on the western front joined forces with the Japanese army that crossed the river near Zhongxiang on the eastern front, and advanced northward from the line of Dangyang, Yuxi River, and Jingmen, coordinating land and air, with a very fierce momentum. The Chinese army inflicted heavy blows on them. By the 29th, all routes had collapsed. The Chinese army took advantage of the victory to pursue, successively taking Weishidian, Jingmingguan, Kuaihuo Ridge, Li Ba, Jinji Ridge, Anju, Junchuan, Hejiadian, Tangjiachong, Jiuli Mountain, Ta'erwan, Huantan, Zhangjiaji, Majiaji, Changshoudian and other places on the eastern front, directly approaching Zhongxiang and Suixian County. On the western front, they successively captured Kuaihuoguan, Lijia, Xianju, Zengjiawan, Lixi, Yanchi Temple, and other places, advancing to the outskirts of Jingmen. All remaining Japanese troops in various places were eliminated. In total, this battle annihilated more than 20,000 Japanese soldiers below the rank of regiment commander of the Kawahara Brigade, creating the recent great victory in that area. The so-called winter offensive of the Japanese army has been completely crushed by the Chinese army. On the northern bank of the Xinqiang River in Hunan Province, there were fierce battles between the Chinese and Japanese armies from time to time. The traffic on the Yue Duan Railway of the Japanese army was frequently destroyed by the Chinese army, making transportation extremely difficult.

Anhui and Jiangxi

The Japanese army in northern Anhui, advancing from Shouxian and Suxian, in central Anhui from Wuwei, and in southern Anhui from Dongliu, suffered heavy losses after being severely attacked by the Chinese army last week. The Japanese army that advanced from Dongliu to Zhide was annihilated by more than 20 troops, and the city of Zhide was completely recovered by the Chinese army. On the 30th, the Japanese army again transferred thousands of troops from Jiujiang, northern Jiangxi, to Pengze. At noon on the 1st, they advanced towards China in four routes from Pengze, southeast and two sides, Malukou, Huangtuling, and nearby areas. After three days and nights of fierce fighting, the Japanese momentum was thwarted. Until the day of the call, the Chinese army launched a full-scale counter-offensive. The Chinese army surrounded the Japanese army on three sides in the Malukou area, and the Chinese army launched a large-scale Huai attack in the Huangtuling area, recovering Huangtuling at 3:00 AM that morning. The defeated Japanese troops fled in droves, and part of them advanced to Taipingguan, where they were ambushed by the Chinese army. They retreated again to Fenghuang Mountain. The Chinese army's offensive was fierce, and they recaptured Fenghuang Mountain and Taipingguan. A spokesman for the Military Commission of Chongqing said that the important battle situation on each front this week is as follows:

Hubei and Hunan

The Japanese army trapped on both sides of the river had been heavily besieged by the Japanese army since the 23rd of last month, and there was a possibility of being completely annihilated by the Chinese. The Chinese army, which attacked Anyi, northwest of Nanchang, once attacked into the city and burned the Japanese army's warehouse, causing heavy losses to the Japanese army.

Shanxi and Henan

In the Qinyuan area of ​​Shanxi Province, the fighting has been fierce for days. Since last week, thousands of Japanese troops have advanced in separate routes. One route, with more than 2,000 people gathered from Linfen, Hongdong, and Zhaocheng, attacked east via Anze. Another route, with more than 2,000 people, attacked north from Changzi and Tunliu. One route attacked southwest from Qin County, aiming to meet in Qinyuan. The Chinese army relied on the superior terrain, and fought back separately. After several days of fierce fighting, the Japanese were defeated. Another 2,000 Japanese troops who attacked east from Chencun, Jiang County, were intercepted by China in the Ren Village Zhang Shang Village area. The Japanese army, unable to support themselves, were defeated and returned to their original location. In addition, there have been fierce battles in Linfen, Hejin, Jiexian, Xiaxian, and other places recently. The Chinese army once approached the vicinity of Nanguan in Xiaxian County. Most of the Japanese highways and electric wires have been destroyed by China. The Japanese army that advanced towards Loba in southern Henan was severely attacked by China, with numerous casualties. The corpses transported to Wulidian totaled more than 700. On the night of the 30th of last month, the Chinese army in northern Henan launched a surprise attack on the Japanese army north of Qinyang, killing many Japanese soldiers. At noon on the 1st, the Japanese army in Qinyang launched a large-scale counterattack and was defeated again by China.

Guangdong and Guangxi

The Chinese army in southern Guangdong has continued to attack the Japanese army along the Guangzhou-Sanshui and Jiangmen-Foshan lines in recent days, inflicting heavy losses on them. A part of them also sneaked into Guangzhou City and attacked the Japanese Military Police Headquarters. The Japanese army in Guangzhou, Jiangmen, Foshan, and other places is now stepping up its guard. The Chinese army in eastern Guangdong once attacked Fengxi, Chao'an Prefecture, and recovered the Japanese-occupied strongholds of Changmei and Fengxi. The security captain took the opportunity to lead his troops to revolt and jointly kill the Japanese. The remaining Japanese troops besieged in Guinan and Zhenpuguan were fiercely attacked by the Chinese army on the 29th of last month, successively capturing Langanzha, Guanqian'ai, Molisha, and other places. The Japanese army in Zhennanguan could not support themselves and hurriedly fled to the Liangshan and Dongdeng areas across the border on the morning of the 30th. The pass was completely captured by the Chinese army. There are no traces of Japanese troops in Guangxi Province.

Northern Jiangsu

The Japanese army in Huaian, Baoying, and other places advanced in separate routes on the 29th of last month. One route attacked south along the Yun River embankment from Huai to Wuhandong, and one route joined forces with the Japanese army in Baxianbu in Baoying to attack Panpa in the north. The Chinese army fought back separately, killing more than 300 Japanese soldiers. The remaining Japanese soldiers were defeated and returned to their respective locations. The Japanese army under Dongsanwuxia in Gaoyou rode multiple motorboats and dragged wooden boats through Xiazhuang to disturb Ergou, but they were intercepted by the Chinese army, sinking three Japanese boats and several wooden boats, killing more than a hundred Japanese soldiers. The Japanese were unable to support themselves and fled back to Gaoyou. At the same time, a part of the Japanese army near Gaoyou attacked Dianwuduo and was also repelled by the Chinese army.

### The Chinese Government Authorities Ordered the Closure of the Vietnamese Border. The Safety of Travelers Cannot Be Guaranteed. Malignant Malaria Is Now Epidemic in Hekou

Chongqing – According to official notices received by the foreign consulates today, the Chinese government authorities have ordered the closure of the Vietnamese border, prohibiting the passage of Chinese and foreign travelers. The stated reason is that the Chinese authorities cannot guarantee the safety of travelers on the 90-kilometer journey between the end of the current Yunnan-Vietnam Railway and the Vietnamese border. Two Frenchmen arrived in Kunming today and have returned due to this new order. Some travelers recently attempted to walk through the above-mentioned area where the railway was cut off, saying that the area has dense forests and many miasmas. Malignant malaria is now epidemic in Hekou, and many people have died, most of them within eight hours of onset. Recently, a foreign missionary died of malignant malaria while handling transportation matters for the Chengdu West China Union University in the area. His successor, Dr. Crawford, also suffered from the same disease and is quite serious. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)

### The Sino-British Military Alliance Theory Cannot Be Readily Believed

London – A Reuters diplomatic correspondent stated that reports from the Japanese side that British Ambassador to China Kerr and Chairman Chiang are currently conducting negotiations in order to conclude a secret military alliance between China and Britain have not yet been confirmed here last night. However, London officials issued a warning, urging people not to easily believe the speculations and rumors currently circulating regarding the British ambassador's trip to Chongqing. The news from the Japanese side allegedly came from a reliable Chinese source in Shanghai. The alliance planned by China and Britain includes the UK actively rushing to transport munitions from India, Burma, and Singapore to Chongqing, and aircraft factories being established in India, Burma, and Singapore so that the latest aircraft can be transported to Chongqing. If war breaks out between Britain and Japan, Chiang Kai-shek's troops must be subject to the control of the commander-in-chief of the British forces in the Far East, etc. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)

### Daily Necessities in Chongqing Have Not Fallen in Price

Chongqing – The rice price in Chongqing has been falling continuously these days, which is very comforting to the people. However, the prices of other daily necessities have not fallen due to hoarding by merchants. The local newspapers have all commented on this. For example, the Central Daily News published an editorial, advocating that the government should control it to stabilize prices. The Saodang Daily stated that the people should organize groups to investigate the hoarding of merchants, and when necessary, they should also audit the accounts of financial institutions. If any fraudulent behavior is found, they should be reported to the government for severe punishment. (Havas dispatch, 7th)

### French Newspapers Comment on the Vietnam-Thailand Dispute, The Territorial Demands Should Be Strictly Rejected, France Should Take a Calm and Firm Attitude

Lyon – Regarding the frequent disputes between French Vietnam and Thailand, "Le Temps" recently commented, advocating that France should adopt a calm and firm attitude and resolutely reject any territorial demands made by Thailand. The article stated, "If our country accepts any territorial demands made by Thailand, Thailand will definitely become insatiable and continue to make new demands, because Thailand's attempt is obviously to gradually establish a "Greater Thailand", thereby placing land that does not belong to the country and other races other than the Thai race within the country's territory. Moreover, judging from the demands made by Thailand, it can be seen that Thailand's intention is to take advantage of the current international situation to systematically sacrifice Vietnam for its own benefit. If foreign forces seem to be encouraging Thailand in secret, these foreign forces will invariably exhaust all methods to prevent the various colonies of the French Empire from being at peace and thereby undermine their unity. In addition, judging from the comments of Japanese newspapers, it can be seen that although Thailand is eager to seek support, it seems that it may not be able to achieve much in Japan and other countries in the Far East. In short, our country has always treated Thailand with a generous and friendly attitude. Now Thailand is actively carrying out anti-French propaganda. The reason for this is probably because the government is controlled by the 'Greater Thailand Movement'. However, our country has already taken a firm stand in both law and fact and should adopt a calm and firm attitude in the future." (Havas dispatch, 7th)

Thai Planes Bomb the Capital of Laos

Savannakhet – Four Thai planes dropped bombs on Vientiane, the capital of Laos, this afternoon. Earlier, a French aviator from a French air force base in Laos told a United Press reporter that they had encountered eight Thai planes in a recent incident on the Mekong River. The planes flew very well and were made abroad. Some experienced French aviators said that Thai aviators seemed to have sufficient flying experience. (United Press dispatch, 8th)

Report of the American Reporter's Inspection

Although Thai planes scouted over Tachek this morning, the reporter felt that it was quite quiet here. The French army is still continuing to gradually turn this town on the Mekong River into a defensive position against aggression. Thai machine guns still occasionally fire at this place, and Thai searchlights also shone on the Mekong River between the Thai city of Nakhon Phanom and this town last night. A French officer showed the reporter the locations where Tachek was bombed, saying that Thailand is now using the latest American-made planes to bomb. Thai aviators also fired machine guns at villagers and threw bombs by hand. The reporter had previously visited the French military headquarters in Laos and learned that the only Thai-Vietnamese war news that the French officers there had heard was the border incident transmitted by radio. However, French officers said that the Thai army has excellent foreign equipment. The problem on the French side is how to make good use of their weapons. It was also heard that there were a large number of Thai troops stationed behind Nakhon Phanom. The French said that they believed they would be able to deal with the Thai invasion. They are now under orders not to fire a shot unless the situation is urgent. (United Press dispatch, 8th)

The Panamanian consul in Hong Kong is currently negotiating to secure the release of the ship. (United Press dispatch, 8th)

Editorial

### China and Greece

At the beginning of the twentieth century, when the power of capitalist imperialism was expanding to its peak and some ancient civilizations were withering, some people compared the historical evolution of various nations to the life of an individual, from youth to old age. They concluded that some ancient civilizations, such as Egypt, Greece, India, Persia, and China, had embarked on an inevitable process of aging and were beyond remedy. The world thereafter would only be left to emerging nations to compete for hegemony. This view was not very different from the reality at the time, so it was very appealing in form, and the fate of these ancient civilizations seemed to have been predetermined by the Creator and impossible to escape. It wasn't until after the end of the First World War that the tide of nationalism swept the globe, and some ancient nations were no longer content with their destined fate and strived for ways to survive. Some small and weak nations that had fallen into semi-colonial and colonial status were struggling to compete with the emerging imperialist nations. This proved that the distinction between youth and old age was not necessarily reliable. However, the complete overturning of that theory was due to the examples provided by China and Greece, the oldest cultural nations in Asia and Europe, in their resistance to powerful enemies.

Looking closely at the current international situation, one must first acknowledge the great contributions of the Chinese and Greek nations in the war. Since 1931, the world order established after the previous World War has been fundamentally overturned: people are accustomed to laziness and complacency, and they sit idly by and watch the spread of invasion and poisoning. Thus, the wildfire broke out in Manchuria in an instant, and then spread to the Rhineland, collapsing the Kingdom of Abyssinia and destroying the Spanish Republic. The then powers, claiming to be first-class powers and responsible for maintaining international justice and security, were stunned and stood idly by without knowing what to do, so that the idea of conquering Asia and conquering the world was openly published in documents and newspapers, touting it as a basic national policy, making the safety and order of the whole world threatened again. If it were not for China's rise to fight and exchange heavy sacrifices for the effect of curbing aggression, it would not be difficult to imagine what the Far East would be like at this moment, and what impact it would have on the world. Furthermore, this summer, Nazi Germany launched a blitzkrieg, and in less than a month, Norway collapsed and France surrendered. Although Britain is still fighting alone and vows not to yield, it still feels overwhelmed and powerless to cope with the Axis powers' encirclement of the Middle East and Europe and their close collusion with Japan. If it were not for Greece's firm rejection of Italy's attempt to resist with all its strength, and defeating the powerful enemy for more than a month, almost shaking the Axis foothold on the eastern coast of the Adriatic Sea, then not only would the situation in the eastern Mediterranean and the Near East become more dangerous, but also drastic changes would inevitably occur in the South Pacific, making the aggressors feel that they could do whatever they wanted without fear of punishment. Therefore, although it is still difficult to predict how the future of the international situation will evolve, in addition to the continued efforts and support of the Chinese and Greek nations, there is still a need for relevant powers to provide close support and actively respond. In the past, the great contributions of China and Greece's hard fighting have indeed established an indelible feat in modern history.

Comparing the Sino-Japanese War with the Greco-Italian War, the former has lasted for a long time and has consumed a large amount of the opponent's strength, while the latter has won quickly and has seriously frustrated the Axis offensive; although the forms are very different, in terms of contribution, they are the same. China and Greece have always been known as weak countries and have been subjected to long-term rule by foreign races in history. Their past politics have also gone through periods of chaos and civil war, but once they rise up to resist violent aggression, they can always unite the whole country against the enemy and unleash their potential, so that those who regard small and weak nations as easy to bully and think that aggression can be quickly successful, cannot but receive serious lessons, suffer heavy blows, and fall into a dilemma of advancing and retreating. This miracle is not seen in Denmark, the Netherlands, or even France, which is known as a first-class power, but only China and Greece can shine in modern history, which is enough to prove that these two nations are not only not aging, but are experiencing a vigorous and prosperous rebirth. The reason for this still needs to be sought in their long history. In general, a country with an ancient culture, especially when its past historical evolution has experienced a long period of stagnation, will inevitably accumulate some corrupt and evil dregs, hindering its proper evolution, and showing signs of decline and decay in appearance. On the other hand, the excellent cultural traditions of its nation must also have deep roots and a solid foundation; even if they exist only latently in the inner layers of the social structure, they will never die out due to multiple setbacks. And once there is a suitable opportunity and chance, it can be carried forward, just like plants and trees meet the spring sunshine, and the sick and weak get a blood transfusion. Today's China and Greece in the war against foreign aggression are exactly this kind of situation. Rather than thinking that this is unexpected, it is better to say that it is an inevitable cause and effect. In terms of the history of the Chinese and Greek nations, there have been many past events in which they fought hard and survived in the face of powerful enemies; the battles of Marathon and Plataea in ancient Greece, and the battles of Feishui and Cailishi in the Southern Jin and Southern Song dynasties were all examples of using the few to defeat the many and the weak to defeat the strong, which is enough to show their great talent and strong potential. Today's facts can be said to be a re-enactment of the glorious war history of ancient times, and they are even more magnificent and great. This is not national exaggeration, nor is it belittling any emerging countries and nations, but just based on reality to prove that ancient cultural nations are not necessarily aging. And those countries that lack a deep self-awareness and blindly act according to their own will, even if their national strength has only been prosperous not long ago, the fleeting prosperity has more examples in history, and it will be difficult to avoid the fate of immediate decline.

### Saturday Night; London Sky Is Calm; Many German Aircraft Bases Destroyed

London - Britain has been subjected to air raids from 9 p.m. onwards, but yesterday at this time there was no report of German aircraft arriving in British airspace. This may be due to the weather in the occupied areas and the fact that the German aircraft bases were fiercely attacked by central aircraft on Friday night. At the same time, reports were received here on Friday of the strikes carried out by British bombers. That night, a large number of British bombers soared over the Orleans Plain to Holland, raiding various airfields, where explosions and fires occurred everywhere. Two British aircraft did not return, which shows the intensity of the bombing. The docks in Calais, Dunkirk, and Boulogne were all hit by bombs and exploded. One of the British aircraft that bombed an airfield in the Netherlands and Belgium was chased by an enemy aircraft, but it evaded skillfully and escaped after an hour. When the Royal Air Force carried out the above-mentioned attacks, the German aircraft's bombing activities were greatly reduced. No bombs fell on London on Friday night. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)

London - After the Royal Air Force carried out the largest attack on German bases since the start of the war, the skies over Britain were very calm last night.

It also bombed and destroyed the runways of 14 German airfields on the border between France and the Netherlands. It is generally believed that the reason for the sudden tranquility over the entire British Isles is partly due to this. Officials said that the British aircraft's air raid lasted from Friday night to Saturday, and large fires broke out everywhere that was bombed. (International News Service dispatch, 8th)

London - From dusk yesterday to 2:30 a.m. today, no German aircraft were seen flying over the British Isles.

On the other hand, according to sources here, British aircraft had successfully raided German territory and the seaports in the occupied areas. (International News Service dispatch, 8th)

London - There was no German aircraft activity over Britain last night, and the residents were able to sleep peacefully. This is really the first time since the start of the German air blitzkrieg.

### Wounded British Ship Arrives in Uruguay; Has Entered Dock for Repairs

Montevideo - The British merchant ship converted cruiser, the Carnarvon Castle, arrived here yesterday afternoon. The captain requested that the authorities allow the ship to remain in port for 48 hours for repairs. When the ship arrived, crowds gathered on the shore and cheered. The sailors on the ship also leaned on the railings and waved their hats in response. According to a brief communiqué, the ship engaged in battle with a German raider for ten minutes. The German ship tried to escape and refused to engage. The damage suffered by the Carnarvon Castle is visible on the surface and is easy to repair. However, the German ship must have suffered heavy damage and was overtaken and destroyed by the British battleship Warspite (31,100 tons). The Carnarvon Castle entered the dock at 5:00 p.m. and transported seven dead and ten injured ashore. According to Uruguayan officials who boarded the ship, they saw several holes in the hull, and several places were hit above the waterline, but the remaining reporters, including Ren Le, were not allowed to approach the ship's berth and stood on a pier 500 yards away to watch the ship's arrival. According to them, they could not see the signs of heavy damage on the ship. All the injured were flown to a British hospital for treatment. According to rumors, the British battleship Warspite is now sailing north, looking for the German ship. The intention of the Uruguayan naval authorities is that the German ship escaped safely, which is proven by the fact that the British cargo ships Argentine and Duchess, which were hiding in this port, sailed out in the afternoon.

### Spain Consults with US on Loan; But No Agreement Has Been Reached

Washington - US Secretary of State Hull confirmed last night the report that Spain is consulting with the United States on a loan of $100 million, but pointed out that no agreement has been reached to date. Private observers believe that this loan will be used to pay for Spain's large imports of food and raw materials, but Spain must guarantee that these imports cannot be transshipped to Germany or Italy. Hull also said that the loan negotiations between the United States and Argentina may have results that are beneficial to Britain. Hull did not comment on the reports in the press that the US-Argentina negotiations included the US guaranteeing Argentina's payments for Spanish goods. (United Press International dispatch, 8th)

### German Air Force Bombing Statistics

Berlin - The official here announced last night the number of bombs spent by the air forces of Germany and Britain in November. It is said that the British Air Force dropped a total of 430,000 kilograms of bombs in Germany in November. The German Air Force dropped a total of 6,747,000 kilograms of bombs in Britain during the same period, which is 15 times more than the number dropped by British aircraft. In that month, German aircraft bombed Britain a total of 23 times, dropping 5,055,000 kilograms. The remaining 1,692,000 kilograms were dropped on British military targets. In that month, London suffered 2,187,000 kilograms of German aircraft bombs, Birmingham suffered 825,000 kilograms of German aircraft bombs, Southampton suffered 567,000 kilograms, Coventry suffered 552,000 kilograms, Liverpool suffered 175,000 kilograms, Bristol suffered 178,000 kilograms, Plymouth suffered 117,000 kilograms, other places suffered 604,000 kilograms, British ships and escorts suffered 206,000 kilograms, British air force ports suffered 59,000 kilograms, and other targets suffered 36,000 kilograms.

### American Newspapers Agree with Loans to China

London - The American newspapers received here regarding the criticism of expanding loans to China expressed unanimous support. At the same time, comments from Swedish newspapers on the "treaty" signed by Japan and Wang were also received, proving that even the Swedish people, who are isolated in a remote corner of Europe, are not deceived by the "treaty" signed by Japan and Wang. The Stockholm Times explained the "treaty" signed by Japan and Wang, saying that this means that the Sino-Japanese War does not have the hope of ending earlier due to the signing of this treaty. This treaty is only a gesture of Japan imitating the Axis powers. The Chinese government feels that it is sufficient to continue the war to the end since the reopening of the Yunnan-Burma Road and the increased aid to China from the United States and the Soviet Union. All the information obtained here says that the Sino-Japanese War is not easy to end. The Gothenburg Times also said that after the "treaty" was signed in Japan, the hope of peace is even more slim. A paper treaty can never end the war, and the Soviet Union does not like this treaty. For the sake of the Soviet Union's interests, it must not allow Japan to dominate China. The authoritative weekly "The Economist", which studies finance and finance in London, published a commentary saying that the preliminary negotiations for the treaty took almost a year, and there was a delay of five months after the "treaty" was signed, which is incomprehensible. In order to reduce the harshness of the conditions, a year of negotiations was really necessary, but even after a year of negotiations, the conditions are still rare and outrageous. The conclusion is that if Japan obtains the fact of free trade in any region of China, the special rights of the concessions are no longer necessary, because (the entire China has become Japan's vast concession). The Chinese government believes that this treaty is Japan's attempt to ridicule itself in a state of boredom when the war of aggression has entered the fourth year and the war situation has not progressed. Moreover, the fact that all countries in the world do not attach importance to this "treaty" can further inspire the morale of the Chinese people. The timely lending of the United States is an expression of trust in the Chinese government. All countries that pay attention to the situation in the Far East have a very deep impression of China's invincibility, and not only the Soviet Union. The London News Chronicle in its newspaper on the 6th specifically stated that the Soviet Union will treat Japan coldly and aid China. The headline of the Communist Party's Daily Worker also stated (the Soviet Union told Japan that its policy towards China will not change), and published the statement of the Soviet Ambassador to Japan, Smetanin, to the Japanese Foreign Minister, saying that although Japan signed a treaty with Wang Jingwei, the Soviet Union's policy towards China will not change, and the Soviet government does not regard the anti-communist item in Article of the Japanese-Wang Treaty as its target, and it does not affect Japan's desire to adjust its relations with the Soviet Union. The newspaper also reprinted detailed statistics on the military victories achieved by China from the Soviet Red Star newspaper. The Moscow radio news received in London is also particularly rich in news of Chinese victories and the Chinese government's efforts to improve the people's living conditions. (Dispatch, 8th)

### Aviation Memorial Donation is Considerable

Chongqing - Chen Qingyun, a veteran of the Air Force, went to the United States to raise aviation memorial donations, and has now returned to Hong Kong on the 5th. According to his report, overseas Chinese in various parts of the Americas contributed more than 6.3 million US dollars, and overseas Chinese in the Philippines also donated 1 million pesos. Overseas Chinese in various places also have a firm belief that the war of resistance will be victorious. (Havana dispatch, 7th)

### Hunan Province Promotes Upland Cotton Planting

Leiyang - The cotton-producing areas of Hunan Province were originally limited to the counties along the lake. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the yarn mills have expanded, and the cotton source is insufficient. In order to increase cotton production, the authorities have specially promoted upland cotton planting and worked hard to promote cotton planting in the southwestern counties of Hunan Province. A large number of technicians have been sent to lend high-quality seeds. (Dispatch, 8th)

### Estimated Direct Tax Revenue for Next Year

Chongqing - The government hopes that direct tax revenues such as income tax, profit tax, stamp tax, and inheritance tax can reach 135 million yuan next year, and land tax can reach at least 200 million yuan. From the beginning of this year to November 18, income tax revenue was 43.9 million yuan, profit tax revenue was 37 million yuan, stamp tax revenue was 4.7 million yuan, and inheritance tax was levied on July 1, with a revenue of 2,700 yuan. Part of the land tax this year can be paid in agricultural products for the government to set up military and civilian granaries. An order has now been issued to all provinces to levy land tax from January 1 next year. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)

### Hellenic Army Continues Northward Advance: Occupies Key Town of Telvino; Italian Army Fights Rearguard Action to Cover Retreat

Athens, News was released here last night in an official Greek communique, stating that Telvino town, on the highway south of Albania leading from Argyrokastro to Santi Quaranta harbor, has been occupied by Greek forces. A Reuters correspondent, filing from the Greek-Albanian border, reports that Italian forces are currently engaged in rearguard actions, covering their retreat. Yesterday, Italian forces desperately attempted to prevent the Greek army from advancing along the Skumbi River towards Këlcyrë, as the Greek army's capture of Këlcyrë would sever the only road connecting Italian forces to Elbasan. Heavy fighting is ongoing in multiple locations along this northern front. The village of Gotkocë, southwest of Pogradec, saw relentless combat throughout yesterday, with Italian forces exerting all their strength to halt the Greek advance. Greek forces northeast of Pogradec have advanced along the shore of Lake Ohrid towards the village of Udënisht, intending to flank the Italian army and protect the defensive line leading to Elbasan. On Friday in this area, elite Greek infantry engaged in fierce hand-to-hand combat with Italian forces in the mountains, resulting in the capture of over six hundred Italian soldiers, including an infantry colonel. Fierce fighting has also erupted in the region of Moscopole, with the Greek army seizing a mountain southwest of the town in a decisive victory, and advancing directly towards Orshuvë. They also captured a height near the village of Drenovë, previously held by an Italian artillery battery. It is reported that a total of three hundred Italian soldiers were captured along various fronts yesterday. The British Royal Air Force headquarters in Greece announced last night that British aircraft attacked Valona on Friday, with one bomb striking an ammunition depot, causing a large plume of black smoke. Vehicle parks and military buildings were also hit and exploded. All British aircraft returned safely. (Reuters, 8th)

Athens, The Greek High Command announced today that Greek forces, having crossed Santi Quaranta, have pushed forward and occupied Telvino, a key road junction in Albania, last night. It is reported that since the capture of Santi Quaranta on Friday, the Greek army has advanced northward with irresistible momentum in two directions, and occupied Telvino last night. The distance to Argyrokastro, abandoned by Italian forces, is now less than half. Further west, another column of Greek troops has advanced along the coastal road to Chimara, complementing the overall advance of the Greek forces in Lower Albania. The rapid advance of the Greek forces in Lower Albania aims to prevent the retreating Italian army from establishing a new line of defense stretching from the Adriatic Sea to the Vjosë River. At the same time, it is reported that victorious Greek forces in the snow-covered mountains west of Logara, chanting "Christmas in Tirana", charged with bayonets and hand grenades yesterday in fierce hand-to-hand combat, capturing several villages. These villages all control fortified high ground. One Greek column advanced from the side to the shores of Lake Ohrid, while another column advanced to the south bank of the Shkumbin River, threatening the town of Kukës, a crucial point on the main road to Elbasan. British and Greek aircraft are intensifying their pursuit of the retreating Italian forces relentlessly, chasing them directly to their base. The Greek side stated today that British bombers destroyed a large Italian ammunition depot in Valona, and that several hundred more Italian soldiers were captured, including many officers. It is also reported that a major fire has engulfed the entire city of Argyrokastro, its fate entirely in the hands of the Greek army. Moments later, a Greek report confirmed that reports of bloody unrest in Milan, Trieste, and Florence have been fully verified. (International Dispatch, 8th)

Athens, A dispatch from a former Reuters correspondent states that Italian forces along the southern front, from Santi Quaranta to Premeti, are continuing to retreat, abandoning large quantities of military supplies. It is reported that the town of Telvino, located on the road from Argyrokastro to Santi Quaranta, has also been captured by Greek forces. On the front slightly further north, Greek forces, after encountering fierce resistance, captured several important high grounds with bayonet charges. Italian forces are currently attempting to reinforce their troops in order to halt the Greek advance along the Skumbi River towards Këlcyrë, as the Greek army's capture of Këlcyrë would sever the only road connecting Italian forces to Elbasan. The Jewish community of Athens has sent a letter to Greek Prime Minister General Metaxas, expressing their gratitude for his determination to fight for the freedom of Greece and its religious principles, and appealing to the world, especially the United States, for aid to Greece. (Reuters, 8th)

Rome, The Italian High Command announced that an enemy attack on the left flank of the Italian Ninth Army on the Greek front has been repelled. Only reconnaissance activities have occurred in other sectors. Italian aircraft bombed military targets in Preveza and Ithaca. Enemy aircraft attacked Valona, but were intercepted by anti-aircraft fire and fighter planes. Naval anti-aircraft batteries shot down one enemy aircraft, and fighter planes also shot down one enemy aircraft. Two other enemy aircraft were also hit by Italian aircraft and were seen to catch fire, escaping into the clouds. In North Africa, Italian aircraft carried out low-level strafing runs against enemy transport vehicles east of Bir Hakeim, destroying several. One Italian aircraft bombed military targets near Mersa Matruh at Raml. In East Africa, Italian air groups attacked transport vehicles, highway stations, and airfields. All Italian aircraft returned safely. (Haitong Dispatch, 8th)

Greek Forces Continue Offensive: Engage in Hand-to-Hand Combat with Italian Army

Albanian Greek Army Headquarters: In the past twenty-four hours, Greek forces in the Pogradec sector have continued their offensive, engaging in hand-to-hand combat with Italian forces. They have secured a foothold in the area of the Dajti Mountain to the west, from which they can advance towards the Elbasan oil fields. A reporter witnessed the fighting between the two armies from a mountain peak. Both sides employed intense artillery fire. The shells fired by the Italian forces were clearly visible in the air, and the massive explosions reverberated throughout the Lake Ohrid region. The area is littered with Italian supplies abandoned by the retreating forces. The weather was clear yesterday, ideal for air operations, but the reporter did not see a single Italian aircraft during a five-hour inspection of the front lines. Five Greek reserve units and supply columns, like a long snake, fearlessly charged towards the shores of Lake Ohrid, undeterred by the rain of machine gun, mortar, and artillery fire from the Italian forces. (United Press, 8th)

Greek Army Pursues on Three Fronts: Aims to Cut Off Italian Retreat Route

Southern Capital: According to news received here from the Italian-Greek front, heavy fog shrouded the northern battlefield yesterday, halting all combat operations. However, according to reports from Greece, the Greek army continues to make progress. The Greek army is advancing along three fronts: one to the north of Pogradec, advancing along the shores of Lake Ohrid; the second to the southwest of Pogradec, along the Skumbi River valley; and the third to the southwest of Moscopole, along the banks of the Devoll River. The Greek army intends to cut off the Italian army's retreat route to Elbasan. Italian forces are putting up fierce resistance. Due to the adverse weather conditions, few air battles occurred. It is reported that large numbers of Italian reinforcements have arrived at the battlefield, gradually halting the rapid advance of the Greek army. (Haitong Dispatch, 8th)

Italian Army Launches Five Counterattacks: Blocks Greek Offensive

Southern Capital: Today's report from Lake Ohrid states that Italian artillery fire has halted the Greek advance. Italian forces are firmly holding positions on Mount Kamja and Mount Mallke, cutting off the Greek advance towards Elbasan. Near Moscopole, Italian forces launched five counterattacks yesterday, attacking Greek forces in the Devoll valley. After fierce fighting, they were finally repelled. (Haitong Dispatch, 8th)

Greek Army in Albania Obtains: Important Italian Documents

Athens, Documents obtained by the Greek army upon entering Albanian territory have proven Italy's premeditated intention to invade Greece. Today, a Greek government spokesperson presented photographs of these documents to newspaper reporters. These include orders to annihilate Greek border guards by surprise, and a notification issued to the Ferrara Division on October 26, stating: "Our current objective is Epirus. The time has come, and we must prevail." (Reuters, 8th)

### Italian Government Replaces: Chief of Naval Staff; Establishes Deputy Chief of Staff; Rumors of Revolts in Three Italian Cities

Rome, Italian Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Cavagnari resigned today. Admiral Riccardi has been appointed as the new Chief of Naval Staff, Admiral Campioni as the Deputy Chief of Naval Staff, and Admiral Iachino as the Commander-in-Chief of the Fleet. (Haitong Dispatch, 8th)

New York, It is heard here that the British Broadcasting Corporation broadcast that riots have broken out in Fiume and Trieste, but did not provide further details. (United Press, 8th)

Washington, The U.S. government has received confidential reports from Italy stating that public sentiment within Mussolini's regime is uneasy and the situation is quite serious, particularly in the northern heartland. The International News Service learned yesterday that members of the U.S. Embassy in Italy have sent unredacted, comprehensive reports in recent days, detailing Italian citizens' reactions to strict rationing, excessive taxation, and military setbacks. A senior government official told reporters that these reports should be taken seriously. People sympathetic to the United States hope that a revolution against the Fascist regime will occur soon, or that the Italian-German axis will break apart at the southern end. Although the available reports do not allow for a definitive prediction of this outcome, new information suggests that "the internal situation in Italy has reached an extremely serious stage, and it is possible that events will unfold." (International Dispatch, 8th)

Rome, Italy newly established a Deputy Chief of Staff yesterday, whose candidate is also undetermined. This person's role is to assist the Chief of Staff and act as his replacement when he is absent. Hereafter, the General Staff will have a general from each of the army, navy, and air force. (Haitong Dispatch, 8th)

Athens, Yesterday the Greek forces made rapid advances in both the northwest and the west, seeking to prevent the Italian army from building new defensive lines. While the Greek army was advancing, there was news from the Greek side that bloody rebellions broke out in at least three major Italian cities. It is rumored that Milan, Florence, and Trieste have experienced serious rebellions verging on large-scale riots. It is reported that on Friday, Blackshirts fired upon civilians in Trieste, resulting in the deaths of several and injuries to many more. (International Dispatch, 8th)

London, A Reuters military commentator says that the resignation or dismissal of Italian Chief of the General Staff, General Badoglio, is an extremely important matter. The full significance of this event cannot be assessed until we know for certain whether it was a resignation or a dismissal. In any case, it is a sign of the greatest difficulty in Mussolini's political career. If Badoglio was forced to resign by Mussolini, the resulting chaos and lack of trust are readily apparent. Is Mussolini perhaps aware that the situation is so serious that he has to take special measures in the hope of saving the Italian forces in Albania from destruction and restoring the fascist prestige shattered by the Greek army? Does Mussolini perhaps hope that replacing people can reverse the dangerous situation? But is this the real reason for Badoglio's resignation? I do not think so. Because the situation for the Italian army is certainly precarious, replacing military leaders will only cause panic among the Italian people. Now, the person replacing Badoglio is an unknown person in the military, one with rich experience in commanding the army, a politician rather than a military man. From this perspective, Badoglio's dismissal does not seem to have come from Mussolini's coercion. Then did Badoglio resign voluntarily? If this is the case, then the meaning is important. Badoglio is a soldier, with a reputation for integrity and honor. He would never abandon his troops in a military emergency. But if he is dissatisfied with the Fascist regime and opposes Fascist policies, then this is a different matter altogether. Is Badoglio involved in the crisis caused by Fascism? Badoglio is aware that the current trend is increasingly unfavorable to Italy, and knows that those who oppose Fascism should rise up in a timely manner to respond to the appeals of the people and restore the country to constitutional order and give the Italians their freedom? This is not known for certain as Badoglio's true intentions. Only a sustained attack on a weak and exhausted Italy can bring about this change. At this time, Britain should not only be guided by sound military considerations in its actions, but also comprehensively consider political theories and the psychology of battlefield soldiers and the Italian people to determine a timely and vigorous strategy. Since ancient times, all major wars have relied on courage and a spirit of adventure as one of the most reliable methods of victory. Now this day has arrived. British and Greek forces have already engaged in small-scale joint operations. If the British and Greek fleets were to jointly attack Valona in coordination with the Greek army on land, the Italian forces in Albania would suffer a fatal blow. As for Libya, the British army only needs to defeat the Italian forces at Sidi Barrani and drive them out of Egyptian territory, without having to penetrate deep into Libya along the only water-supplied road. This is enough to have a major military and political impact on Germany, Italy, and Japan. (Reuters, 8th)

### Romanian Gasoline: Exported to Italy; State Control of Foreign Oil Companies

Rome, The Italian official news agency recently received a dispatch from Bucharest stating that the Romanian government has approved the export of a certain amount of aviation gasoline to Italy in exchange for Italian lead production. (Reuters, 8th)

Bucharest, The Romanian government issued an order on December 4 to seize the assets of all foreign oil companies in the country. It is now estimated that the Romanian government will pay a sum of US$7.5 million for all pipelines, pumping stations, oil storage tanks, and other equipment that should be received by the government.

### French Government Plans: Occupational Guild System

Vichy, Labor and Industrial Production Minister Pétain reported to the Council of State yesterday on his proposed "New Organization of Industry and Professions" plan. Its content imitates the occupational guild system of the Middle Ages. All occupations are generally controlled by the state. In the event of disputes between labor and capital, the state will also mediate. According to him, this plan only lays the foundation for the future organization of French industry and occupations, and may not be able to solve it at present, because it cannot be implemented until the French social organization is completely reorganized. Even if the country wants to adopt a professional group system, it will not be successful without several years of preparation. Therefore, if our country wants to establish a perfect occupational guild system, it must first establish new moral standards and formulate a new constitution. (Havas Dispatch, 7th)

Vichy, Political observers here recently stated that the government's reorganization of the national industry in accordance with the principles of "cooperation" will encounter some difficulties, and therefore will require adjustments in the next few years. However, it is easier to start when reorganizing agricultural institutions. Therefore, the government's laws on reorganizing agricultural institutions are expected to achieve concrete results. It is estimated that there are 30 million people in the country engaged in agriculture, and in the future they will all be subject to the current government's "National Rural Professional Group Organization Law." This law is a major achievement of the current government, and its main purpose is to instill the principles of cooperation into various rural areas. At the same time, those who drafted this law also referred to foreign experience, so as to adopt its strengths to adapt to the personality and temperament of the French nation, and stipulate that occupational groups of a cooperative nature should be organized based on the common interests of all classes, in order to eliminate class struggle. In addition, French rural areas are dominated by small self-cultivating farmers, and the number of hired workers is less than that of landlords, so organizing this occupational group is relatively easy. However, this law cannot be implemented immediately at present. The government plans to first appoint 30 commissioners to form a special committee to be responsible for handling the reorganization of national agriculture in preparation for the implementation of this law. (Havas Dispatch, 7th)

### Turkish Foreign Minister: To Visit Greece

London, According to news reported by the Southern Slavic capital newspaper, Turkish Foreign Minister Dr. Saracoglu will visit Greece soon, meeting Greek Prime Minister Metaxas in Thessaloniki to discuss the issue of an Italian-Greek armistice. Although this statement has not been officially confirmed, it is widely rumored that the German Ambassador to Turkey, von Papen, has already made this suggestion to the Turkish Foreign Minister. The suggestion is that Greece can achieve peace after rejecting British protection, and then Greece should join Hitler's New Order, with Germany guaranteeing its security, with the nature being similar to the recent example of Romania. However, there are currently no signs as to whether the Greek Prime Minister, Metaxas, will accept this suggestion. The motivation behind von Papen's peace initiative is largely due to Italy's defeat and Germany's urgent need for various Greek products, such as chromium, fruit, and raisins. Turkish people in London believe that Greece will continue to resist, and that Britain is providing Greece with the greatest possible military assistance. The scale and scope of this assistance are extremely impressive to the Turkish people. (United Press, 8th)

### Hitler Demands of France: Price for Permanent Peace: Annexation of Alsace-Lorraine: Use of the Remaining French Fleet

Southern Capital: According to reliable information obtained here, Hitler will propose to Vichy Foreign Minister Laval that Germany annex Alsace-Lorraine and use the French fleet as the price for France to make peace. When Laval visits Berlin in the future, it is believed that the German side will ask him to approve an agreement stipulating that the territory France is to cede is limited to Alsace-Lorraine. As for the Italian side, it will make no demands, and French colonies, including Nice, Corsica, and Tunisia, which were the clear reasons for Italy's participation in the war, will remain intact. Hitler will also promise Laval to withdraw German troops from French territory, except for the Channel ports, as Germany will continue to attack England. Although German troops will not withdraw from the Channel ports, local administrative power will belong to the French side. (Reuters, 8th)

Basel, A Berlin dispatch in a local newspaper said that the development of the German diplomatic offensive must be sought in Southeast Europe. Vichy Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval's visit to Berlin will not materialize, so there may not be any developments on the French side. According to sources in Berlin responsible, the purpose of the visit of the Hungarian Foreign Minister Czaky to the south is to improve relations between Germany and Yugoslavia and between Hungary and Yugoslavia. If Hungary and Yugoslavia both agree to abide by the "European New Order," then the last opposing elements can be expected to be eliminated, and Yugoslavia can be recruited into the Tripartite Pact. It is understood that the German Foreign Office has contacted Switzerland and Sweden to discuss the possibility of joining the Tripartite Pact or recognizing Germany's leading position in the "European New Order."

### Bulgarian-Turkish Relations: Have Not Yet Been Clarified

Sofia, Regarding the Bulgarian envoy to Turkey, Kiroff, returning home to report on the current situation, British newspapers have claimed that Bulgaria and Turkey will jointly seek improvement in politics and economics, which well-informed sources here believe to be an exaggeration. People in Sofia also believe that the understanding between Bulgaria and Turkey can stop defensive measures and pacify the Balkan situation, but so far Turkey has not taken the steps indicated by the Bulgarian newspapers, so it is not yet possible to talk about Bulgarian-Turkish collaboration. It is expected that the intention of spreading this news is to make the Axis countries suspect Bulgaria's attitude. Regarding the relationship between Bulgaria and Turkey, Turkey previously proposed expanding commercial affairs to Sofia, and Turkey sent a commercial delegation to Sofia and added a commercial office to the Turkish embassy in Bulgaria, but this plan, due to the inability of the commercial staff to expand it, has not yet been clarified, so it has not yet been implemented. (Haitong Dispatch, 8th)

### Romanian Prime Minister: Delivers Speech

Bucharest, Romanian Prime Minister General Antonescu delivered a speech in front of the Monument to the Unknown Soldier in Bucharest this morning, solemnly pointing out the "ethical value of the life of a soldier." The audience of 10,000 was made up of veterans, and those who had performed meritorious service and received medals. Antonescu reiterated that Romania must be in a position to repel the enemy in order to exist. The people of Romania must strive to improve themselves and work hard in order to contribute to the future of the motherland. (Haitong Dispatch, 8th)

### Soviet Union to Open: Stereoscopic Cinema

Moscow, Moscow will soon open the world's first "Stereoscopic Cinema." In this cinema, viewers no longer need to use stereoscopic lenses. The structure of the cinema's screen is completely different, with an area of 25 square meters. The cinema will soon be completed, and the first film will be the stereoscopic color film "Land of Youth." Due to the stereoscopic effect, viewers can see singers stepping out of the screen and being in the same place as them. At the same time, viewers will also think that branches, flowers and leaves are all around them, and that surging tides seem to be rushing towards them. (TASS Dispatch, 7th)

A Painful History of the European War (V)

### A Memoir of the Last Days of Warsaw

The fall of Warsaw, the capital of Poland, is truly the most tragic page in the history of this decisive European war. This translated article is taken from the book "Siege" by Julien Oryan, a well-known American photojournalist. It was delayed and is only now being published due to the backlog of other translated manuscripts:

At 1:00 AM on September 7, 1939, I and others boarded the last train into Warsaw and arrived at the station in complete darkness. After leaving the train, we tried to find a taxi but couldn't, as they had all been requisitioned for military use. Fortunately, we found a horse-drawn carriage and rode with several friends directly to the Europa Hotel.

I initially thought the hotel would be crowded with journalists, but it was mostly empty. I chose a large room with a bathroom and asked about the rent. The receptionist shrugged and stated the price, but seemed not to care about the money. In fact, I never paid that rent.

The next morning, I learned that the Polish government had already moved out of Warsaw, and all journalists, photojournalists, and newsreel cameramen had also left. It seemed I had no way to get out. However, the ideal of a photographer was realized at this time. I was in the most tragically besieged city in modern history, and I could capture the various stages of the siege of Warsaw on film without worrying about competition from other photographers.

Soon after, I also learned that Mayor Starzyński had decided to lead the civilians in a desperate defense of Warsaw, truly a hero in a besieged city. As long as the Polish people exist, the name of Starzyński will surely be a source of pride, and patriotic feelings will surely arise spontaneously. I applied to Mr. Starzyński for a photography permit. He received me kindly and replied in a calm tone, "We must stay here, but you must eventually take the photos out of the city, so the world can know what happened here." (Note: Starzyński has since been executed.)

Thereafter, during my terrifying time in Warsaw, I never saw Mr. Starzyński lose his composure. On one occasion, while I was in his office, two bombs fell thirty yards away, shaking the building like an earthquake. Afterwards, all was silent, as if dead. Mr. Starzyński, in this situation, only told me not to stand by the window to avoid danger. However, he himself stayed in the bombed building for two weeks, never leaving. Mr. Starzyński broadcast daily, encouraging the people with brave words, saying that although the government had moved elsewhere, the people still had leaders to command them.

Mr. Starzyński provided a car and a guide and interpreter for my use. First, we went to a large Catholic hospital that had been bombed. The hospital had been hit by five bombs, each creating craters 30 to 35 feet in diameter. The hospital was in extreme disarray. The western end of the building had been destroyed. Fortunately, the parts that were not destroyed still had many windows shattered, and the beds were covered with ointment. In the surgery room, the overhead reflector was teetering, and the operating table was also covered in scattered ointment.

On another day, a newly built six-story building was also hit by a bomb. When I arrived, I saw the bodies of fourteen women and children, their flesh and blood a mess, lying stiffly on the ground. A young woman had been bombed, her head and feet incomplete. It was truly heartbreaking and shocking to see, and the sight was terrifying.

The desperate defense of Warsaw was quite moving. I inspected the cellar of a maternity hospital, where there were fifty young women suffering the pain of bombing and shelling. Some had just given birth, and their infants had been hit by stray bullets or shards of glass. However, these young women, no matter how severe the pain, all had the strength to endure it.

One day, we drove through the fields outside the city. We were slightly delayed and did not witness a tragedy, but we learned that seven women were digging potatoes in a field to fill their stomachs when two German planes suddenly flew over and dropped a bomb on a small hut two hundred yards away, killing two women inside. The women digging potatoes all lay prone on the ground, hoping the German planes would fly over and not notice them. But the German pilots were not satisfied. They flew back a moment later and opened fire on the field with machine guns, killing two of the seven women.

As I was photographing the corpses, a little girl ran over and stood beside the body of a woman, her sister. The girl stood there for a moment, then burst into tears, crying, "Sister! What happened to you? Tell me! Who will I rely on without you?"

The girl then looked up at us with a bewildered expression. I embraced her tightly, wanting to comfort her. The girl burst into tears again. I and the two Polish military officers with me couldn't help but have tears welling up in our eyes. What words could we use to comfort the girl? Later, I spoke with many farmers, refugees, and even American expatriates who had been shot at by German planes flying less than a hundred feet above. I became convinced that the Germans were deliberately harming civilians.

While taking photographs, I saw an old woman standing in front of a pile of rubble, where her destroyed apartment building had been. In the rubble, a stove remained, the fire extinguished, but a teapot on the stove, still boiling, was hissing. The embers in the rubble had not been extinguished and were still smoldering. A few feet away was an iron bed, only the frame remaining. The old woman aimlessly poked at the rubble with her cane, searching, but what she was looking for, I fear even she herself did not know. Another old woman, over seventy years old, stood woodenly, her apartment completely destroyed, carrying out two silver spoons and a pair of scissors, and nothing else. Nearby, a child, about seven years old, was playing kickball. In another courtyard, scorched by fire, still smoldering, several families gathered, checking the few remaining belongings, only a statue of the Virgin Mary, a pot of vegetables, and bedding.

### Authorities Convene Meeting to Thoroughly Stabilize Rice Prices: Meeting to be Held This Afternoon at the Municipal Council to Re-Determine Price Limits and Profits; Rice Merchants Requested to Release Stored Rice for Sale

The Shanghai Rice Merchants Guild, in response to the soaring rice prices which have had a significant impact, issued an emergency notice on the 4th of this month, limiting rice prices to no more than the prices of the 2nd of this month. Recently, rice prices have shown improvement, and the cost of ordering foreign rice has decreased. Rice prices could have gradually fallen, but due to speculation and manipulation, market prices have soared abnormally. Domestic rice has reached as high as 108 yuan per picul, and Siamese rice has also been raised to 89 yuan. It is becoming increasingly difficult for ordinary people to make a living. If a thorough solution is not quickly found, the future is unimaginable. Both concession authorities are concerned about this and have decided to invite leaders of various rice merchant guilds to the Municipal Council meeting room at 2:00 PM this afternoon to discuss stabilization measures.

Re-Determining Price Limits and Profits

Today's meeting is very important. In addition to deciding to investigate centralized storage levels, price limits per bag and allowable profits will be re-determined, and measures will be implemented swiftly and strictly to achieve the goal of suppressing rice prices. At the same time, the suggestion of raising 15 million yuan to store 200,000 bags of foreign rice in public warehouses for public sale will also be discussed. As for what the price limit per bag of 222 catties will be set at, it is said that some are advocating for 80 yuan for each bag of Yangon rice, with the Rice Merchants Guild previously setting the follow price at 96 yuan. It is rumored that today's meeting may set it at 90+ yuan. If that is the case, then the price per picul would be 70+ yuan. It is greatly hoped that everyone attending can put the people's food first and consider this carefully. As for the export of No. 1 tribute rice, it is said that the ban may be lifted in February. During this period, the rice stored in Shanghai is more than sufficient, so there is no need to panic. Furthermore, the method of public warehousing and public sale can be implemented when the new rice comes on the market.

Rice Merchants Request Sale of Warehouse Rice

The authorities say: "To whom it may concern, the rice shops of our guild are engaged in the retail sale of rice and grain, and are similar in nature to other businesses. We are definitely not speculators. We purchase and sell daily, and we always welcome customers. We definitely do not hoard and refuse to sell. We buy high, sell high, buy low, sell low, and our prices are transparent. We definitely do not engage in speculation to seek illicit profits. Our costs are high, and turnover is difficult. We definitely do not have the huge capital to monopolize the market. Our members are scattered throughout the city, with a large number of businesses and intense competition. We are definitely not a small number of three or five companies that can manipulate the market. When our members purchase goods, it is like customers buying rice from a store. It is rare to buy high, and we definitely have no intention of raising prices.

No Intention of Raising Prices

The above six points are all well-known facts. The general public, although aware of this, often does not understand the underlying reasons and often misunderstands and criticizes us, leading to resentment. We suffer unwarranted blame. Although this is a small matter for individuals, it is a major matter for social stability and public order. Therefore, we must make a clear statement. In this extraordinary period, prices are high for everything, and rice prices in particular are rising without end. The people's livelihood is extremely difficult. The market is chaotic, and dangerous signs are emerging. Those who have goods are still hoarding them and refusing to sell, seeking huge profits. What else is this but hoarding and speculation? If strict measures are not taken to deal with this, the food supply for the citizens will be unimaginable. The situation is urgent, so we are submitting this truthful report to your office, hoping that you will consider rice and grain to be important for the people's livelihood and security. Please immediately investigate the exact amount of rice and grain currently stored in each warehouse, order each storer to produce samples, and sell them immediately at cost plus a legal profit in order to stabilize market prices and maintain the food supply for the people."

General Opinions on Grain Storage Issues

Previously, Mr. Yu Qiaqing proposed ordering 200,000 bags of foreign rice to be stored in this city to suppress rice prices. Rice industry groups should be responsible for 100,000 bags. In addition to the 60,000 bags already subscribed for by the miscellaneous grain and bean rice industries, the remaining 40,000 bags can also be subscribed for separately. In addition to the 100,000 bags, the silver money industry has agreed to order and store 50,000 bags of grain, and the shortfall will be borne by other powerful groups. However, according to the general opinion of the people, since this rice and grain is intended to stabilize the rice price in this city, we should publicize the cost and sale price fairly and sell it at a fair price when necessary. Furthermore, the rice industry's request for free trade should be carefully studied.

Telegram Requesting the Release of No. 1 Tribute Rice

The French Vietnamese authorities' prohibition on the export of No. 1 Saigon rice has obstructed the delivery of 85,000 bags of orders placed by rice merchants in this city, affecting the local rice market. In addition to submitting a letter to the French Consul General in this city to forward a telegram to the French Vietnamese authorities requesting release, the Bean Rice Guild also plans to telegram the Vietnamese Chinese Chamber of Commerce for negotiation. According to a certain rice industry figure, even if the ordered grain is not released and shipped to Shanghai at present, it should be possible to ship to Shanghai as usual when the new Saigon grain comes to market next spring. Furthermore, the demand for No. 1 tribute rice is not strong and does not affect the overall market.

Rice Market System Urgently Needs Reform

According to a person familiar with the rice market yesterday, the current rice market has lost its normal trading functions. It cannot be stabilized without thorough reform, but this cannot be achieved with a single document or resolution. Strict restrictions must be placed on rice merchants entering the market. Unless the methods of the miscellaneous grain industry are followed, allowing only licensed dealers and rice merchants to enter the market, all others should be prohibited. This will normalize the operations of dealers, brokerages, and exchanges, and stabilize the rice market.

### Seeking Permanent Solutions to the Hardships of Chinese Constables: Yu Qiaqing Urges All Industries to Contribute to a Fund to Enthusiastically Assist with the Welfare of Chinese Constables

Due to high prices and difficult living conditions, Chinese constables in the Public Concession have made requests to the authorities to improve their treatment and have at one point expressed their attitude. After Mr. Yu Qiaqing's efforts, a temporary solution was reached, and the authorities, understanding the suffering of the Chinese constables, announced an increase in living allowances the night before last, bringing the matter to a close. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency visited Mr. Yu Qiaqing yesterday to inquire about the process and was given the following statement:

The Attitude of the Chinese Constables is Commendable

The request of the Chinese constables in the Public Concession to improve their treatment this time was due to the difficulty of their living conditions. I believe that it is reasonable in principle, so I took the initiative to mediate. However, the responsibility of the police officers to maintain law and order is that of public servants of society and is of course different from other jobs. The attitude of the Chinese constables this time is commendable, and the Municipal Council is very understanding of their suffering. After multiple studies and discussions, and under the difficult economic circumstances of the Municipal Council, the living allowances for Chinese constables and other staff have been increased. The fairness and consideration shown to all staff is admirable.

Permanent Assistance Measures Should Be Considered

However, during this period of high living costs, although the increased allowances will allow the Chinese constables to barely maintain their daily lives and avoid freezing and starvation, they will still have no recourse in the event of unforeseen circumstances such as funeral expenses and other special expenses. Furthermore, if they could obtain rice and flour at affordable prices, they could serve the society with greater peace of mind. Therefore, I express my sympathy for the fundraising effort to find a way to help the Chinese constables solve their problems. The Municipal Council's finances depend on various taxes, and are already insufficient to meet the budget. If other expenses were to be added, the burden on the citizens would be increased, which is clear to all.

Sympathy, Cooperation, and Joint Subscription to a Fund

Therefore, I hope that all Chinese constables will always keep in mind the importance of their responsibilities, work diligently, and be more cautious. At the same time, I urge all sectors of society to show sympathy and mutual assistance and to enthusiastically subscribe to a fund to support the welfare of the Chinese constables, reduce the burden on the Municipal Council, and reduce the burden on the general public. Guaranteeing that the Chinese constables can serve with peace of mind is also guaranteeing that all sectors can develop together.

Affordable Supply of Rice and Flour

As for the affordable supply of rice and flour, this will also be considered within the realm of possibility. We will work with the Price Stabilization Committee and the flour mill trade association to find ways to implement this. Finally, Mr. Yu stated that he was very pleased that the directors and staff of the Municipal Council, both Chinese and foreign, had strongly supported this mediation effort, and that Chief Inspector Bao and Deputy Chief Inspector Yao had managed it well, and that the Chinese constables had maintained a proper attitude.

### House Tax Revenue Doubles After Implementation of Increased Surtax: Revenue Increases by More Than Double for Both Western and Chinese Style Houses: Municipal Council Announces Autumn House Tax Statistics

Since the Public Concession Municipal Council implemented a 50% increase in the Municipal General Tax starting in July of this year, tax revenue has doubled. According to the Municipal Council's published statistics for the autumn house tax (the first quarter after the increase): A. Western-style houses: Central District: 1,489,624 yuan, compared to 787,929 yuan in the same quarter last year. Northern District: 290,851 yuan, compared to 138,612 yuan in the same quarter last year. Eastern District: 532,128 yuan, compared to 287,477 yuan in the same quarter last year. Western District: 945,107 yuan, compared to 480,298 yuan in the same quarter last year. Outer Road Area: 417,343 yuan, compared to 25,155 yuan in the same quarter last year. Total: 3,675,143 yuan, compared to 1,909,471 yuan in the same quarter last year. B. Chinese-style houses: Central District: 613,91+ yuan, compared to 152,609 yuan in the same quarter last year.

Eastern District: 901,365 yuan, compared to 480,575 yuan in the same quarter last year. Outer Road Area: 48,665 yuan, compared to 25,984 yuan in the same quarter last year. Total: 2,244,064 yuan, compared to 1,109,898 yuan in the same quarter last year.

### British Church to Create a Fundraising Christmas for Disaster Relief: Performance and Fundraising for Hangzhou Refugees: American Church Members Donate Clothing to Shanghai for Distribution to Jews

The British Church on Jiujiang Road in this city will begin a historic fundraising campaign, scheduled to begin on the 12th of this month during the Christmas season. At that time, there will be wonderful performances and skits, and all donations will be handed over to Bishop Curtis of Hangzhou to help local Chinese refugees. The performances will be organized by the church's youth fellowship. All the scenery and other aspects have been carefully designed. The performances will begin with readings of biblical passages, accompanied by music and hymns. Admission will be free. This type of performance was very popular in the Middle Ages. In recent times, it has been felt that ancient religious dramas have great aesthetic value, so churches throughout England have resumed their use, from rural churches to the world-famous Canterbury Cathedral in London. Every Christmas, these dramas are performed, but the form and dialogue are different from ancient times. The content, however, remains unchanged.

Apply Quickly to Receive Donated Clothing

Since the Shanghai Office of the China Child Welfare Association began collecting winter clothing for poor children in the city, it has received more than 12,000 yuan in donations and more than 800 pieces of new and old cotton clothing. The association, recognizing that the weather is getting colder and that poor children urgently need clothing, is currently planning to rush the production of 2,000 sets of cotton clothing to meet the urgent need. It is understood that the association has already printed "Request for Winter Clothing" forms. Any impoverished families who want to request clothing for their children can obtain them from the association's office (No. 208, Middle Duoya Road). The applicant's name, address, family situation, and the children's ages and names must be provided, as well as proof from reputable professionals, or schools, social organizations, etc. After verification, the clothing will be issued.

American Church Members Send Winter Clothing to Shanghai

The American Church in this city, after consulting with the Salvation Army and the American Red Cross, telegraphed its New York headquarters to reroute two large packages of winter clothing, which had been stranded in the United States and could not be shipped to Europe, to Shanghai to help Jewish refugees in this city who had been displaced from Europe. It has been learned that this winter clothing has arrived in port on the American mail ship President Coolidge. The American Church has sent people to the docks to take care of the unloading and transportation to the church's hall in Hongkou, and then will distribute the clothing to the refugees to keep them warm through the winter. If there is any surplus, it will be discussed with other charitable organizations to determine how to distribute it. There are more than 14,000 Jewish refugees in this city, living in various shelters in the Huishan district. Previously, due to a lack of relief funds, the daily meals had been reduced from three to one. In light of this, Jewish relief organizations appealed for relief from all sectors on the +th of this month. Furthermore, Russian immigrants in this city, scattered throughout the Hongkou area, recently requested relief from the Kaiyuan Coal Mining Company. The company generously agreed to donate several tons of coal and will also sell other coal at a reduced price to the White Russian immigrants.

### Huihua Money Shops to Change to Limited Organizations: Join the Guild and List on the Market Next Spring

In addition to the Xinzheng Money Shop, which has completed its fundraising and set up a preparatory office managed by Xu Shanchang and Fu Tingxu, Baochang Money Shop, with a capital of 500,000 yuan and managed by Chen Lishan, and Yonglong Money Shop, with a capital of 500,000 yuan and managed by Luo Shaodong, are also raising funds. Once the preparations are complete, they will be listed on the market. It is said that the listing date for each shop will be in the spring of next year. In the future, they will definitely join the Money Shop Guild and become limited organization money shops.

### A Fire at the Japanese Army Depot: Fires Shine Across the Sky, Munitions Explode, Burning for Hours, All Ships Inbound and Outbound Are Blocked

The Japanese Army Depot in Wusong suddenly caught fire at around 11:20 AM yesterday. Because the interior was filled with military supplies such as fuel, which are easily flammable, once it caught fire, it quickly spread. Although the local fire department and the customs fireboat, together with the Japanese army and navy, worked hard to put out the fire, the munitions stored inside exploded violently and were not easily extinguished for a while. As a result, the fire shined across the sky, and the flames soared. All ships inbound and outbound were stopped. As of 3:00 PM, the fire had not been completely extinguished. The cause of the fire is not easy to determine for the time being.

### Economic Warfare: China Has Achieved Victory: Three-Nation Loans Totaling US$400 Million: The Battlefield Will Change After Weapons are Replenished

According to a certain financial figure in this city, since China's war of resistance against Japan began, the total amount of standby loans from Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union to China has not been less than US$400 million. Foreign currency bonds issued by the Chinese government are not included in this figure. In the past, US loans to China were only 25 million yuan per batch, and British loans were only 2.5 million pounds each time. But this time, the US loan alone reached 100 million yuan, and the UK will also lend China 10 million pounds at a time, totaling about US$40 million, which proves the active support of Britain and the United States for China. China has obtained this huge amount of money, and its finances have become more abundant. The future of the war is unusually optimistic.

The Numbers of Victory and Defeat are Already Very Clear

The economic situation of China and Japan, one growing and the other declining, the numbers of victory and defeat are already very clear. This British loan is different from the previous two. The previous loans focused on stabilizing the exchange rate, which was used by the Japanese to a considerable extent. This time, the main purpose is to purchase British goods, and the scope extends to the British colonies, which is even more important. At this time, the Anglo-German war is in full swing, and German planes and submarines are very rampant. Ships around the British Isles are sinking at a rate of about 100,000 tons per week, and Britain itself has a huge demand for war materials, making it difficult to supply foreign countries at the same time.

Full Utilization of Foreign Materials

Therefore, all of China's British loans have not yet been fully utilized due to transportation reasons. Goods from the UK itself are not easy to transport to the Far East. The expansion of the purchase location to the British pound group of countries is intended to remedy previous shortcomings. In the future, China will have the opportunity to utilize materials from Burma, India, and Australia. Recently, due to China's proximity to Burma, the daily necessities of the people in the interior are mostly obtained from Burma and India, such as cotton yarn, cotton cloth, and rice. A large amount has been transported to the southwest in recent times. Therefore, not only will the government's needed materials be easily obtained in the future, but also the daily necessities of the people in the rear will have more sources of supply, and there will be no danger of funds being used by the enemy. This is far better than the previous unrestricted supply without regard to region.

### French Consul-General M. Magre Reviews the Police Yesterday, Approximately One Thousand Chinese and Foreign Police Officers Participate, Those with Meritorious Service Are Awarded Medals

The police force of the French Concession held its annual grand review ceremony at 10:30 AM yesterday, and medals were awarded to Chinese and foreign police officers with outstanding meritorious service. The event was presided over by French Consul-General M. Magre and French Police Commissioner-General Favier, serving as chief and deputy inspectors, respectively. It took place on the square in the Gujiazhai Garden on Rue Luban. Military officers from various countries stationed in Shanghai, including two officers each from the United Kingdom and the United States, as well as representatives from the Shanghai Municipal Council's Shanghai Volunteer Corps and the police force, were invited to attend the review ceremony.

Participating Troops

The troops participating yesterday, commanded by Deputy Commissioner-General and Chief Inspector Poulain of the French Concession Police, included a military band led by D'Erneville, the police flag held by Deputy Inspector Gaodong, four companies of Annamese police, each equipped with four heavy machine guns and two machine gun vehicles, led by Chief Inspector Megham, Inspector Buchaguan, and Deputy Inspector Bonce, a squad of elite troops, a squad of Russian police led by Russian Major Yadabvique, ten machine gun vehicles, six armored vehicles, and ten armed motorcycles. In total, there were over one thousand Chinese and foreign police officers.

Awarding Medals

When French Consul-General M. Magre arrived at the Gujiazhai Garden, he was received by Police Commissioner-General Favier. The military band struck up a tune and played the French national anthem. After M. Magre's inspection, medals were awarded to Public Works Bureau officials and various police officers: a gold medal to Detective Brock, a silver medal to Detective Jackson, a bronze medal to Detective Fals, Detective Demit, Russian Police Slavov, Squad Member No. 2855, No. 393, Chinese Police No. 283, No. 103, No. 302, No. 154, No. 790, Probationary Chinese Detectives No. 62, No. 392, and No. 404; an unrewarded silver medal from the Public Works Bureau was awarded to Inspectors Ulis, Secretary Bowman, Chinese Sergeant No. 17, and No. 100, Chinese Deputy Inspectors Wang Rusong and Tang Yunqing, Detective Jiang Shangwen; an unrewarded bronze medal was awarded to Russian Police Tanimaski, Annamese Police No. 2 and No. 24, Chinese Secretary Xi Yongfa, Chinese Deputy Sergeant No. 207, Chinese Police No. 209, No. 40, No. 361, No. 360, and No. 407, Chinese Deputy Inspector Xie Guangming, Detectives Guo Shaodong and Tian Shiqing, Squad Members No. 36 and No. 43, and Tailors No. 24 and No. 11.

### The French Concession's Housing Regulations Seem Unlikely to Be Implemented; the Consular Authorities Cannot Amend the Civil Code, But the Rent Investigation Committee Remains Optimistic

According to the Shanghai Times, the draft decree proposed by the French Concession Rent Investigation Committee regarding housing issues within the concession (which stipulates various housing regulations) has been submitted to French Consul-General M. Magre in Shanghai. However, committee members stated that they are still closely studying the entire set of regulations and will not submit a definitive draft to the French Consul in the next few days. It is understood that the draft decree aims to abolish illegal rent increases, the collection of sub-rent, and disputes over forced evictions. The chairman of the French Concession Rent Investigation Committee visited various esteemed judges and consular representatives in the city, showed them the draft decree for consideration, and expressed their view of whether the housing regulations were purely police regulations or attached to the national civil law concerning expatriates. If the various consulates recognize these regulations as police regulations, then the French Consul-General has the authority to implement them. However, if they are considered attached to the civil law, it is feared that the various consulates will take an unfavorable attitude towards these regulations. If the civil law of the consular courts includes these housing regulations, then the civil law must be amended, and the consular authorities in Shanghai cannot arbitrarily amend the civil law. It is heard that the chairman of the French Concession Rent Investigation Committee remains optimistic about the success of the decree. However, according to various opinions, no matter how appropriate the decree may be, from a legal perspective, its implementation is unlikely.

### Residents of Western Shanghai Eagerly Seek to Relocate

Yesterday, there were still no signs of lifting the blockade in the western Shanghai area. Wangjia Lane and nearby alleys were still being searched continuously. The "Shanghai Municipal Public Bus" still operated to and from Yuyuan Road and Daxi Road. However, the "Route 1" bus to and from Daxi Road and Dunxin Road suspended operations at 5 PM due to engine failure, leading to severe overcrowding on Routes 1 and 2 to and from Yuyuan Road. Residents within the blockade area complained incessantly, calling the two-cent bus fare "toll money." Some Chinese and foreign residents have begun searching for housing in the concessions, and the unauthorized operation of public buses indicates their intentions. Therefore, it is generally believed that the area west of Haig Road, where roads have been built beyond the concession boundaries, has lost the guarantee of peaceful living and working. It is hoped that the concession authorities will issue a formal statement and take action to stop this behavior.

### First Special Court Staff Request Rice Subsidies

The judges, prosecutors, clerks, and recorders of the Higher First Branch Court and the First Special Court all received salary increases approved by the Ministry of Judicial Administration in September of this year. Judges and prosecutors received a 20% increase, clerks received a 40% increase, and recorders and bailiffs received a uniform 19% increase, all retroactive to January of this year. Guards and security personnel received the same treatment. With the price of rice already exceeding 100 yuan, the staff of the two courts felt that their cost of living had further increased and was difficult to sustain. Therefore, they jointly submitted a petition to the court authorities yesterday, requesting a monthly rice subsidy equivalent to five dou of rice, regardless of future rice price fluctuations. The court authorities have not yet provided a concrete response to the staff's request, but it is expected to be resolved satisfactorily soon.

### President Coolidge Arrives in Port This Morning, Carrying American Nationals Returning Home, Only the Coolidge Scheduled to Evacuate Nationals This Year

The American President liner "President Coolidge" of the American Mail Line arrived in Shanghai at 8:00 AM this morning from the United States via the Philippines and Hong Kong, and berthed at the 12th and 13th pontoons in the Huangpu River. All luggage and passengers were transported by customs launches to the New Customs Wharf for landing. This is the first time this ship has come to China. It is scheduled to leave Shanghai at 8:00 PM on the 10th, sailing via Kobe and Yokohama in Japan and Honolulu, Hawaii, to return to Los Angeles.

Evacuation This Year

When the ship leaves Shanghai, it will carry a large number of American nationals returning home. Passengers who have booked tickets on the ship will be transported in three batches by launches at 5:00 PM, 7:00 PM, and 9:00 PM today for boarding. According to information, the only other ship scheduled to return to the United States this year is the "President Coolidge", scheduled to depart on the 31st of this month. Since the US government advised American nationals in the Far East to evacuate and return home, the number of people scheduled to return to the United States this year is quite large. Therefore, the cabin space on the "President Coolidge" has long been fully booked. All American nationals who have not been able to book seats will have to wait until next year to take a ship back to the United States.

American Nationals in Kuling

The "North China Daily News" reports that there is currently only one American national (female) in Kuling. It is understood that she will also be leaving soon. Afterwards, the number of foreign nationals in Kuling will be less than forty. The fuel problem for wintering there this year has become difficult. Fortunately, the wood and charcoal available nearby are still sufficient, but the price is almost twice as high as last year. The prices of all other commodities have also increased. Although the rice harvest at the foot of the mountain is abundant, the price of rice is five times higher than last year. Most of the lower-middle class Chinese, unable to make a living, have left Kuling and returned home. However, there are still more than one hundred extremely poor Chinese families who have nowhere to go. The relief committee is considering measures to provide assistance to them when the truly severe cold weather arrives. The general situation in Kuling is still considered peaceful, but due to the poverty of some people, there are occasional incidents of breaking into houses and stealing.

Large Volume of Mail

The post office originally planned to send a large volume of mail to the United States and then to Europe on the Russian Empress of the Shan Chang Hing Steamship Company. However, because the Russian Empress was requisitioned by the British military commander in the Far East for military use and stopped coming to Shanghai, it had to be replaced by the "President Coolidge". It is expected to arrive in San Francisco in half a month, and then be transported by rail to New York before being transferred by ship to London. It is expected to arrive there around mid-January of next year, a week later than if it had been carried by the Russian Empress.

### Child Disappears, Neighbors Collude in Kidnapping, Resulting in All Three Criminals Being Captured

Zhou Mujin, a Suzhou native who works as a servant for a foreigner, lives in a flat in Jianzhong Lane, Caojia Lane, Avenue Joffre. He is 35 years old and has a five-year-old son named A'gan. On the morning of the 26th of last month, A'gan suddenly disappeared from the front of his house. At around 6:00 PM that day, Zhou found a letter in front of his door, which was an anonymous communication. Upon reading it, the contents roughly stated that the child A'gan had been kidnapped by "us" and was currently hidden at the end of Daxi Road, demanding a ransom of 1,500 yuan. Neighbors Wu Abing (28 years old) and Chen Fugen (30 years old), both from Suzhou, volunteered to negotiate with the kidnappers. The next day, Zhou gave them 800 yuan. The two men took the money and went, and indeed brought the child A'gan back.

Wang Baolian accused Mei Fei of improper behavior with Yi Lu during the separation and sued her. Mei Fei denied in court that Wang was her formal husband, and therefore, the couple's feelings became increasingly broken. Recently, Wang Baolian, citing the civil law that stipulates that spouses have an obligation to cohabit, filed a lawsuit in the Civil Tribunal of the First Special Court, requesting that Mei Fei be ordered to return home to cohabit and that the defendant bear the costs of litigation. It is heard that Mei Fei is dissatisfied with the judgment and will hire a lawyer to appeal to the Higher Second Branch Court.

Education News

### Director Xu of the Department of Education Summarizes Education in Zhejiang Province Over the Past Year (3)

(3) Regarding the reasons for the laxity in inspection work, in addition to various reasons such as few personnel, many subordinate agencies, heavy internal affairs, and many part-time jobs, there are also those who cannot depart for inspection due to insufficient travel expenses. It is found that some counties have a monthly allowance of three yuan (such as Pan'an), four yuan (such as Chun'an), and five yuan (such as Xiangshan, Ninghai, Suichang, Rui'an, and Sui'an). The most is fifteen yuan (such as Zhenhai and Yongkang), and others are six yuan, eight yuan, and ten yuan per month. Only six counties have actual reimbursement (such as Xinchang, Kaihua, Jiande, Pingyang, Songyang, and Jingning). The department previously stipulated that the monthly travel allowance for national education inspectors was thirty yuan, which all counties considered too much. However, they do not know that active supervision is an important task for improving education. The following should be noted by all counties in the future: (1) The travel allowance for inspectors should be increased as much as possible, with actual reimbursement; (2) The travel allowance for supervisors should be paid from administrative expenses; (3) The travel allowance for education instructors can be paid from the national education fund; (4) There should be more than four months of outside inspection each semester.

(4) Regarding the procedures for correspondence between counties and education agencies, they can be carried out in accordance with the regulations in the "Matters to be Noted When County Education Administrative Agencies Implement National Education" promulgated by the Ministry. Upward correspondence should use concise reports, and downward correspondence should use local newspapers or county government publications to create special columns for announcements, in order to save correspondence procedures and simplify matters. In the past, schools that did not subscribe to newspapers should now make them universally read.

(5) Regarding the distribution of education funds, various conveniences should be provided to the receiving agencies. The education section and the accounting office should clearly define the procedures to avoid separation.

(6) Regarding the appointment of education section personnel, it should be handled in accordance with the recently promulgated "Precautions for Handling County-Level Education Administration" by the Ministry. The difficulties currently recognized by the counties are: (1) It is not easy to find three people to recommend, so it can be changed to one or two people; (2) The prescribed qualifications are too strict, making it difficult to recruit, except for section chiefs, a commutation is requested; (3) It is requested that all current personnel be commissioned without any changes, and new appointments will be handled in accordance with the regulations; (4) Handling in accordance with the regulations may cause work to be interrupted halfway through. The answers to these suggestions are as follows: 1. Current personnel with equivalent qualifications can be submitted for commissioning; 2. If it is not possible to select two people to recommend for the position of section chief in accordance with the regulations, the reasons can be stated and two people can be recommended. Other supervisors and district education instructors can also do the same; 3. Before the section chief is commissioned, a deputy can be assigned first, or a supervisor can temporarily act as the head of the section, so as to avoid work interruption; 4. In the future, the province will register a number of qualified county education administrators for the counties to choose from; 5. Personnel who have been commissioned must abide by the regulations in the precautions and must not be arbitrarily replaced. The Department must approve the change before the education cause is not interrupted due to frequent personnel transfers.

2. Regarding the implementation of national education: (1) The decision to implement national education is due to the hurried preparation time and the three changes in the plan. The difficulties felt by the counties must be many. The Department was constrained by the orders of the Ministry and the number of central government subsidies changed from time to time, so the plan had to be changed accordingly. Recently, the number of schools to be established in each county and the amount of subsidies have been determined within the possible scope of provincial funds. If there are any discrepancies, the counties should seek ways to remedy them. The approved number refers to the number of subsidies. If the local government can raise funds on its own, it is better to run more schools than the approved number. The funding for the implementation of national education is based on the principle that each county raises its own funds. Therefore, the "Measures for Raising Funds for Township Central Schools and Bao National Schools" promulgated by the Ministry has been announced. The measures are quite detailed. If they can be implemented effectively, it will not be without any solutions. It depends on human effort. I hope everyone will work hard. (To be continued)

### The Food Problem in Shanghai Today

— Liu Xizhang

To discuss Shanghai's food problem today, we should look at it from two perspectives: before and after the war. Before the war, there was one way of looking at it, and after the war, there is another. Before the war, the aim was certainly to eliminate the rice panic, but the primary method was to consider the overall economy, such as the issues of foreign rice versus domestic rice, and the impact of low grain prices on farmers, etc. Today, after the war, while we still aim to eliminate the rice panic, we must adopt more feasible methods due to the unique environment of Shanghai. That is, we cannot start purely from theory, but should prioritize the facts.

The first factor forming today's food problem in Shanghai is the daily decrease in the source of domestic rice, which is also subject to "control." Initially, a price limit policy was adopted, originally set at 14 yuan, which was breached, soon breaking 16 yuan, then 17 yuan, and after that, prices rose exponentially, reaching over 100 yuan recently. The price limit policy could not be maintained because, in addition to speculation, one reason was the "control" of domestic rice sources, and another was the limitation on the base price of foreign rice due to exchange rates in the producing areas. Subsequently, the so-called rice market in Shanghai became a market dominated by foreign rice, with the market price of domestic rice being controlled by foreign rice. At this time, although the market price of foreign rice was constantly rising, the source was still relatively smooth, so the monopoly of speculators was limited. However, today, the source of Vietnamese foreign rice has been restricted to a limited extent due to the tense situation (but ships still arrive every day). The extent to which speculators can raise prices is much greater than before. Therefore, for the sake of Shanghai's food supply, the best first step would be to clear the source of domestic rice, but this is impossible. In fact, we have to take a step back and clear the source of foreign rice. This so-called clearing can be interpreted in two ways: the first is to directly order rice from abroad, and the second is to temporarily adjust the rice stored in this port to alleviate the current panic.

The biggest reason for the current food panic is the aforementioned political problems in the foreign rice producing areas, which hinder transportation. Therefore, the price increase is by no means due to the increase in production area prices, but a unique increase in this city, rising five yuan today and ten yuan tomorrow. This is definitely not an increase in freight, insurance, or various costs, but a "man-made" increase by speculators.

Food Before and After the War

Therefore, let's first look at whether a rice panic is possible in Shanghai. There are two main conditions for the formation of a rice panic in Shanghai: the first is limited reserves, and the second is the cutoff of sources. Let's first look at the inventory.

Regarding the reserves of grain, the figures released by various parties differ. Some say there are only hundreds of thousands of bags, while others say there are millions of bags. Naturally, no one knows for sure. However, from various calculations, a reserve of hundreds of thousands of bags is clearly too little; if the person who said this is not shallow, then it is easy to suspect that they have been deceived by rice weevils! Based on the facts, we can first determine that Shanghai has no shortage of food reserves for the following reasons.

A few days ago, various newspapers published statistics from a certain economic statistical agency (published in the newspapers of the 7th of this month), using three methods to confirm the abundance of foreign rice reserves in Shanghai. The first is based on customs records, subtracting exports from imports and then deducting consumption, concluding that Shanghai should have 4 million piculs of foreign rice. The second is based on warehouse reports, which have doubled in the past year. The third is based on arrival statistics, with several thousand bags of foreign rice arriving every day for the past four days. Of these three points, the third point is entirely factual; the second point tells us that rice is increasing without decreasing; the first point is relatively unreliable, firstly because imports through smuggling are not included, and secondly because the foreign rice going to Hongkou may not have been counted; as for the reserves from previous years, the source of domestic rice is even less accounted for. Based on these points, we can know that the amount of rice stored in this port in recent years must often be over one or two million bags.

Why is everyone worried about the arrival of a rice panic, while we appreciate the abundance of reserves? What we should pay the most attention to is that the public's grain reserves today are very different from before the war. Before the war, it was rare for a middle-class family to reserve one or two bags of rice, but today, families above the middle class will not buy rice unless they buy ten or five bags at a time! After consuming two bags, they buy another five bags. In this way, the rice reserves naturally become thicker and thicker. Everyone of course knows the environment of Shanghai today, and naturally knows to prepare for a rainy day, so "stocking up on rice" is the principle of general families. There is also group purchasing of rice, which makes everyone particularly alarmed about the food shortage problem, and also has the tendency to increase hoarding of rice. This is not to oppose group purchasing of rice, but to point out the effects that group purchasing of rice gives us. In the past, the hoarding of rice in Shanghai was oligopolistic, by rice weevils, by financial groups organized by speculators, but today, in addition to the above two, the reserves are also distributed to general families above the middle class. The former is oligopolistic, while the latter is widespread among the public. Which of these two has a larger amount of reserves is very obvious.

Furthermore, the source of foreign rice has never been cut off. Saigon only banned the export of No. 1 foreign rice, and did not ban the export of No. 2 foreign rice, but the arrival of ships is not as orderly as in the past. Even if there is a problem with the source, causing a rice panic in Shanghai, it will still be in the future, not the present of a year and a half!

So where is the crux of Shanghai's food problem? The main problem is the skill of the people handling the food problem. When Vietnam was in turmoil, the already worried Shanghai public was deeply afraid of the food supply being cut off and had the intention to stockpile a large amount of rice. But at that time, someone initiated a large-scale group purchase of rice. It was right to have group purchase of rice at that time, but it was really unacceptable to shout about group purchase of rice. What's more, they were still shouting high-sounding slogans such as setting up warehouses to store rice, which could not be implemented, making people feel that they had ulterior motives. Because it is clear that Vietnam is in turmoil, and doing business is not as easy as usual. But they insist on persuading people to buy a large amount of rice; if they are not short-sighted, are they raising the price of rice? The original hope of the so-called group purchase of rice was to obtain some cheap prices and not be exploited by rice weevils. May I ask, when buying rice at this time, when the source of rice is not expected in the near future, isn't it only to collect the stored rice in this city? On the one hand, they encourage people to buy rice, and on the other hand, they do not actually buy rice from abroad. Isn't this equivalent to raising the limited foreign rice on the market indefinitely? If the price of rice rises, families above the middle class have sufficient savings and it is not a problem; but the working masses who rely on daily wage income have to reluctantly pay high prices to fill their stomachs. The promotion of rice purchase was originally a kind intention, but in fact, it created opportunities for rice weevils and speculators to make unjust fortunes. There is no greater pain than this fact, and no more unwise action than this!

Remedial Measures

Since we believe that, on the whole, the total inventory in Shanghai is sufficient to meet the consumption of all the people for a fairly long period, the first step should be to conduct a registration of rice consumption within the boundary, including private individuals and institutions, restrict their excessive stockpiling, and allow the Municipal Council or commercial organizations to purchase the excessively stored rice at fair prices when necessary, and sell it at a fair price. At the same time, the Municipal Council should lead the commercial organizations to prepare several million piculs of rice as peace rice, to prepare for the entire Shanghai food problem. It is not necessary for the money industry to advance the money for this rice, but public bonds can be issued to avoid the parties concerned from misappropriating and cheating.

For group rice purchases, the Municipal Council should lead various commercial organizations to form a agency to handle the matter, publish the production area prices daily, and accept commissions to purchase on behalf of others.

In short, today's Shanghai food problem is not a matter of scarcity, but of uneven distribution; at this time, only adjustment methods can be used to suppress the panic deliberately created by speculators.

Finally, we must also put forward two facts: First, the impact of expensive food on ordinary people is far greater than on the rich, so all monopolistic behaviors are the most cruel. Second, the result of food monopoly will inevitably affect the entire social order, which should not be ignored! Finally, (1) we hope that all warehouse and rice industry employees will check their own salary income and family expenses. You must know that accomplices are also committing suicide! You must know that it is more convenient for you than anyone else to report rice profiteers. (2) We advise middle and upper-class families not to only sweep the snow in front of their own doors, and help the speculators' schemes. (3) We advise warehouses and storage industries to universally set a deadline for leaving the warehouse; we also advise the money industry to universally prohibit rice mortgages, and urge those who have already done so to redeem them.

### The Development of China's Central Banking System

— Li Baojiang

The development of modern banking shows a trend, that is, most have a strong central bank to control market credit, and various other banks regard the central bank as their backing; therefore, when discussing the banking system, the central bank is the focus.

The so-called central bank is actually a bank of banks; it bears the mission of controlling finance, and its nature is different from that of ordinary banks. Its business should not compete with ordinary banks; its tasks are at least four: First, to unify issuance, comprehensively plan to expand and contract the amount of currency according to the needs of the social economy, and stabilize the market's finance; Second, to centralize reserves, accept the deposit reserves of commercial banks, and be responsible for the transfer and adjustment of each commercial bank at any time; Third, to act as the national treasury, managing all government fiscal revenues and expenditures; Fourth, to set interest rates, implement a rediscount policy for bills, or implement open market operations to manage market credit. With these four points, the central bank can become the head of a country's financial system and the backbone of stabilizing market finance.

Progress Before the War

China had no so-called central bank before 1928; the China and Communications Banks actually had the nature of a central bank. At that time, the branches of the China and Communications Banks were all over the country; the banknotes issued by them circulated throughout the country. Salt customs taxes were also handled by these two banks, which were deeply trusted by Chinese and foreigners. In October 1928, the National Government promulgated regulations to establish a central bank in Shanghai. However, due to the complexity of the domestic financial situation, by the time of the August 13th War of Resistance Against Japan, it seemed that China's central bank had not yet fully possessed all of the above conditions; therefore, before the outbreak of the war in 1937, the government had promulgated the Central Reserve Bank Law to reorganize the existing central bank in order to thoroughly complete the mission of the central bank. Unfortunately, due to the outbreak of the war, it had to be temporarily suspended.

Due to historical relations, China's central bank had to seek the cooperation of the China and Communications Banks in various aspects; thus, a three-in-one banking organization was implicitly formed. In July 1934, in order to maintain financial stability, the Ministry of Finance promulgated the Savings Bank Law; all savings banks, after absorbing deposits, should deposit at least one-quarter of the total amount of savings deposits to the central bank's treasury to purchase government securities and other assets with certain guarantees; this was the initial centralization of reserves. In the spring of 1935, the financial market was extremely panicked. The three banks of China, Central and Communications jointly released loans, and were able to safely overcome the difficulties; this method of rescuing the market was unprecedented. In November 1935, the Ministry of Finance promulgated the new currency law, implemented the legal tender policy, centralized issuance reserves, and unified banknote issuance; commercial banks' use of cash relied on the legal tender of government banks; government banks had an invisible tool to control credit. In 1936, the Central Bank formally participated in the clearing house, and the clearing fund for bills was jointly preserved by the three banks of China, Central and Communications, which was a major progress in China's financial system.

However, in terms of centralized reserves, although savings banks should purchase securities with one-quarter of their total deposits and deposit them with the central bank, they were securities rather than cash, and were only limited to the savings deposit portion, not including commercial deposits. The clearing fund of the clearing house was divided among the three banks of China, Central and Communications according to the ratio of 442, so the reserves cannot be said to be thoroughly centralized. In terms of interest rates, commercial bills in China are not developed at all, there is no bill discount market, commercial banks rarely undertake bill discount business, and the central bank has no rediscount business to speak of, let alone a discount policy. In terms of banknote issuance, although it has been unified, the issuance right is still distributed among the four national banks; acting as the national treasury is a right specially granted to the central bank, and it is easy to do.

Post-War Construction

However, since the War of Resistance Against Japan, the government has taken various constructive measures to stabilize wartime finance, and China's banking system has accelerated its sound development.

A. Four-Bank Lending Committee After the August 13th War broke out, the authorities promulgated measures to stabilize finance, restricting withdrawals, and at the same time established a lending committee in Shanghai, and ordered the China, Central, Communications and Agricultural Banks to establish joint offices and joint lending committees in the locations of their respective banks, specializing in handling the lending and transfer mortgages of agriculture, industry and mining; so that the production of various industries could proceed; and the circulation of commodities could be smoothly established. However, if the administration of the four banks is still independent, it will be difficult to collect and concentrate affairs and command them freely; therefore, there is the establishment of a joint office of the four banks; this institution already has the prototype of a central bank.

B. General Office of the Joint Office of the Four Banks To understand the nature of the General Office of the Four Banks, we only need to observe its business and organization: The highest administrative body of the General Office of the Four Banks is the Board of Directors, composed of the Governor and Deputy Governor of the Central Bank, the Chairmen and General Managers of the China, Communications and Agricultural Banks, and several representatives sent by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs; the Chairman of the Board of Directors and three Executive Directors are specially appointed by the National Government according to regulations; and the Chairman of the Board of Directors is directly granted special powers by the Ministry of Finance, and can take convenient measures and exercise the powers of the four banks on their behalf. As for the powers and business of the General Office of the Four Banks, the main points are as follows: (1) Adjustment of the four banks' securities; (2) Joint lending matters of the four banks and joint investment in special wartime production; (3) Design and distribution of the national financial network; (4) Centralization and use of funds; (5) Entrusted issuance and application of small denomination banknotes; (6) Review of remittances in inland and ports; (7) Review of foreign exchange applications; (8) Adjustment of wartime materials; (9) Management of the collection of raw gold and silver; (10) Promotion of special savings; (11) Review of the four banks' issuance reserves and review of the four banks' budget and final accounts; (12) Sending personnel to inspect the business of the four banks and assess the work of the four banks. It can be seen that the General Office of the Four Banks is actually a wartime mechanism for concentrating financial power, bearing a direct command, management, and supervision responsibility.

This organization is similar to the Federal Reserve System in the United States, making the China, Central, Communications and Agricultural Banks an organic whole. However, there is still a need for thorough improvement in its ability to control market credit and the characteristics that a central bank should possess.

C. Deposit Reserve In addition to the established central financial institutions in China, further research should be conducted on how to gradually complete the tasks of concentrating reserves and setting interest rates. Therefore, in the Provisional Measures for Managing Banks in Extraordinary Times promulgated by the Ministry of Finance and Banking this August, it was clearly stipulated that "In addition to savings deposits that should be handled in accordance with the Savings Bank Law, banks should use 20% of the total amount of ordinary deposits received as reserve funds, transfer them to any of the China, Central, Communications and Agricultural Banks in the local area, and the receiving bank will give appropriate deposit interest." This system is also similar to the situation of member banks in the United States. Because member banks in the United States must deposit deposit reserves with the local Federal Reserve Bank to cope with the occurrence of withdrawals, the deposit reserve rate is slightly different from that in China: for example, the central reserve city is 19.5%, the ordinary reserve city is 15%, and the rural reserve city is 10.5%; the more prosperous the area, the larger the inflow and outflow of bank funds, and the higher the deposit reserve rate should be. The US authorities also raise and lower this reserve rate according to the financial situation to control the interbank lending of various member banks. As for China's regulations on deposit reserves, in addition to having the general meaning, they also contain special intentions: that is, (1) to cope with withdrawals and protect the safety of depositors; (2) to regulate the credit expansion of each bank; (3) to prevent speculation and hoarding, etc.

China has never had regulations on deposit reserves; according to various statistics, the average cash reserve of twelve banks in Shanghai in 1935 (with total deposits of more than 30 million yuan) was at most around 35%. However, in fact, the so-called cash reserve of Chinese banks includes treasury, in transit, and interbank deposits. For example, if 30 million yuan is received in deposits, excluding interbank deposits, the cash on hand is only 10 million yuan. If the deposit reserve is limited to cash in the treasury, according to the above statistics, the average cash reserve of the twelve banks is between 8% and 12%; in general, it is mostly around 10%, which is consistent with London. There should be no difficulty in coping with ordinary withdrawals with this ratio; but it should be noted that China's situation is different from that of the UK. The UK is a country with a developed credit system, so a ratio of 10% is enough to meet ordinary needs; as for China, the habit of using bill circulation has not yet been formed, so maintaining a ratio of 10% in peacetime cannot be said to be a stable ratio; let alone after the outbreak of the war? Therefore, it is a good measure to change the habitual 10% to a legal 20% in the Provisional Measures for Managing Banks in Extraordinary Times; it is also another progress in China's national banks' control of market credit.

D. Interim Measures for Promoting Bank Acceptance and Discount Business There is one more thing that is worthy of our comfort, that is, the Ministry of Finance recently promulgated the Interim Measures for Promoting Bank Acceptance and Discount Business, ordering the four banks to implement bill acceptance and discount rediscount and other businesses as soon as possible. This measure is closely related to the central bank's rediscount policy.

In peacetime, the central bank can control market credit by raising and lowering the discount rate; when market credit is excessively inflated, the central bank can raise the rediscount rate to warn ordinary banks not to abuse lending, and the market's chips can be reduced accordingly; conversely, when market credit is excessively tightened, the central bank can lower the rediscount rate to allow ordinary banks to prepare interest-free funds and calmly lend, and the market's chips can gradually increase; with this method, the financial market can be stabilized.

China's credit system is not yet developed; commercial habits, creditors and debtors, mostly rely on bookkeeping, and rarely use commercial bills. Debtors are inherently subject to the burden of bad debts, and because the repayment period for bookkeeping debts is fixed, funds are also at risk of being frozen. However, commercial bills can be used as credit instruments; because their occurrence must be based on actual transactions; they themselves have their own flow function, and after being discounted to the bank, in addition to the discounter, the acceptor also bears joint and several liability for repayment. And in the discount and rediscount, it can also play its role in correcting improper commercial transactions.

### Financial Review

— Sheng Kaiqiong

—December 7— Sino-American Financial Cooperation (Continued)

This unprecedented large loan is of great significance, far exceeding any other wartime economic assistance provided by the United States to China. Whenever Japan took detrimental actions against the Chinese National Government, the United States adopted various measures beneficial to China's resistance against Japan, such as the US$25 million loan after the fall of Hankou, the embargo on certain essential materials to Japan during the blockade of the Burma Road, and the previous US$25 million loan when Japan joined the Axis powers. This resolute assistance not only sought to offset any serious impact of Japan's recognition of the so-called "Nanjing government," but also constituted a blow against Japan's establishment of an illegitimate system, allowing Japan to monopolize advantages and exploit the equal and fair treatment long enjoyed by the United States. Secretary of State Hull said: "The fundamental policy of the United States in the Far East is to expand possible material and financial assistance to China, because China is resisting aggressive forces and continuing large-scale warfare with Japan to prevent Japan from building the so-called 'Greater East Asia New Order'." Treasury Secretary Morgenthau said: "To maintain the status quo in the Far East, it is necessary to assist China. If China can obtain sufficient economic assistance, it can establish a solid defense, thus indirectly preventing Japan from further openly damaging the interests of the United States." The words of the two gentlemen are truly "eloquent," so the significance of this loan and its impact on the overall situation in the Far East need not be reiterated!

Leaving aside the political implications, let us focus on the financial aspects based on the previous analysis. Regarding the credit loan portion, under mutually beneficial conditions, China is using its own resources to assist its own finances, demonstrating the strength of China's war potential, which needs no further explanation. Regarding the 50 million yuan stabilization fund, according to the financial review on September 28 concerning the third US$25 million loan: "The amount converted into British pounds is more than 6 million pounds, accounting for more than three-fifths of the amount of the Sino-British Stabilization Fund in the 28th year, and its effect on maintaining the exchange rate of Chinese legal tender will certainly surpass the strength of the 5 million pounds of assistance provided by Britain at that time." It also said: "Whether Sino-American cooperation will develop into a way to stabilize legal tender as a result of this is difficult to predict, but the United States truly hopes that China's resistance against Japan will restrain Japan's actions in the South Pacific, so we cannot say that financial cooperation is just a fantasy arising from the US$25 million provided to meet the need for foreign exchange." The so-called fantasy of financial cooperation has indeed been realized due to the United States' use of China's resistance against Japan to restrain Japan, and the assistance it has given to China is not like Britain's 5 million pounds, but a huge sum equivalent to more than 12 million pounds in British gold. Currently, China is encountering a favorable situation, such as the strengthening of the US Army's power in the Pacific, the defense talks between Britain, the United States, and Australia regarding Singapore and other Pacific areas, and now the United States is adding an equal amount of funds for stabilizing legal tender on top of the 50 million credit loan, which will obviously strengthen the stability of China's wartime monetary system and the economic power of resistance against Japan.

### North-South Goods Tangerine Peel Arrives After Long Absence

Tangerine peel has been out of stock for a long time, and market inventories are scarce, lasting for several months. Yesterday, it was heard that Taikoo Company's Jiangsu ship imported some. Because foreign fees have increased several times compared to before, transactions are expensive. Large ones need to increase by thirty to forty yuan to complete a transaction, it is said.

### Hainan Longan Persists in Not Opening

Hainan longan, due to excessive arrivals, the market price had dropped by twenty to thirty yuan. However, buyers believe that the capital is not light, and mostly insist on not selling cheaply, and asking prices are higher than the original price, so the market retreats and there are no transactions. The situation still needs to persist, and it is not easy to approach, it is said.

### Seafood Raw Starch Rises Sharply by Ten Yuan

Raw starch has been rising recently due to the lack of supply. The previous market had repeatedly increased prices. The bottom inventory is gradually thinning, and high-end products are even more scarce. For example, Renqiang, SanX, and KG have already sold out. There are currently a few similar products in stock, which have risen sharply by ten yuan. Secondary flour has also increased by three to five yuan, but the increase for tertiary flour is lower, only increasing by two to three yuan.

### Coal Hongji No. 1 Small Size Price Falls Back After Rising

Hongji No. 1 small size, previously due to the lack of goods in various industries and a certain foreign firm on Sichuan Road closing and not issuing warehouse receipts, resulting in a shortage of spot goods, the market was high. Brokers shouted a price of 270 yuan in the black market, but there were still no wholesale transactions. Recently, after the arrival of new goods, the price has fallen back slightly. Depei goods are 255 yuan, and some have been released. Haifeng small size is 210 yuan, from the warehouse by truck, with an additional handling fee.

### Discussion on Winter Tonic Prescriptions

— Wu Keqian

In our country, for patients who require long-term conditioning and those who need tonics in winter, two types of prescriptions are generally adopted: tonic pastes and pills. Pills are inconvenient for women and children to swallow, and the medicinal residue is more, which hinders digestion, so tonic pastes are often preferred over pills. The combination of tonic pastes not only refines the essence and is easy to digest, but also has a sweet taste and is easy to take. In addition, there are important advantages that are not easily understood by the general public, so they are specifically highlighted for the reference of those who pay attention to winter health.

(1) Tonic pastes extract the effective ingredients of Chinese medicine: The variety and efficacy of Chinese medicine have been recognized worldwide. However, refining the essence has not yet become widespread, so patients who want convenience often abandon this and choose other options. However, tonic pastes are different: tonic pastes refine the essence everywhere and extract the effective ingredients. For plant-based ingredients, it is advisable to soak them for one or two nights before decocting. For those that become plump and juicy after soaking, mash and squeeze the juice and discard the residue. For those with less juice, decoct with strong heat to extract the juice. For those that are tough and resilient, decoct with gentle heat to extract the juice. For those with volatile components, boil one or two times to extract the juice and prepare the paste after decocting is complete, so that their aroma is fully retained and not lost. For those that promote menstruation and invigorate blood, decoct with wine and water first, then combine with the paste, so that it has the power to enter the blood circulation. For mineral-based ingredients, crush them finely before decocting, and then wrap them in fine silk, so that the texture is pure and fine, and they take effect immediately after entering the abdomen without causing stagnation. The same is true for substances burned into charcoal. As for those that contain animal-based ingredients, such as sheep brain, sheep kidney, beef bone marrow, pig spinal cord, mutton, and venison, each has its own method of preparation to achieve perfect effect. Therefore, the refinement of tonic pastes is the most scientific method, so that if the prescription is properly formulated, none of the dozens of ingredients are contradictory or mutually antagonistic, and all have the virtues of chief, assistant, adjuvant, and guide, then the speed of its effectiveness is far from comparable to other medicines.

(2) Tonic pastes condition all parts in all aspects: What our body needs are proteins, nitrogenous substances, carbohydrates, and fats, as well as vitamins present in various substances, for nutrition and growth, and to keep the cells of all parts of the body active. Even a slight deficiency can lead to illness, and excessive loss can lead to mental decline. The plant-based ingredients contained in tonic pastes not only promote metabolism and keep all parts healthy, but also often contain vitamins to supplement human needs. The minerals and carbonaceous materials commonly used in Chinese medicine often have the function of regulating the stomach and intestines and purifying the blood, and the animal-based ingredients used are mostly what modern people call organ therapy, which has the effect of strengthening the stomach and replenishing deficiencies. Whatever part needs it, it is paired with whatever substance, so it takes care of everything in all aspects and has an indescribable effect.

(3) Tonic pastes are combined with gelatin and are suitable for all: The combination of tonic pastes uses turtle plastron gelatin or donkey-hide gelatin and deer antler gelatin, etc., which are used to nourish yin and nourish blood or support yang, each according to its suitability, and once combined into a paste, it can be stored for a long time without spoilage. For expensive military medicinal materials such as deer velvet and deer antlers, incorporating them into the paste can be done without any loss. With patient consumption, there will be no ill effects. This is the most reasonable way to use it as a long-term tonic. It is best to dissolve a spoonful in warm water every morning, which has a small amount and a great effect. It can be taken with morning snacks, can relieve dryness and thirst, women and children can take it, and it can be used for all diseases (except for external wind-cold). It has been passed down for hundreds of years and has not declined, which is well-founded.

### Asthma and Its Treatment

— Chen Cunren

Upon entering winter, there are many more people suffering from asthma, especially the elderly. The symptom of asthma is commonly known as wheezing, and in medical books it is called phlegm-fluid asthma.

The elderly are weaker in qi and blood, and their physical strength is insufficient, like the power part of a machine has less power and weak propulsion. Phlegm accumulates in the lungs, and they are also unable to warm and transport it. This phlegm is cold in nature, and when spit out, it is crab-foam-like, white and foamy. When it is spit out, those that sink are all liquids. When not spit out, it gathers in the lungs and stomach, sticking together and not transforming. Over time, it accumulates more and more, and the phlegm becomes firmer and firmer, eventually forming masses. In medical terms, this is called phlegm-fluid, which lies dormant in the lungs and stomach and does not disappear year after year. The lungs lose their ability to breathe properly, and there is a constant gurgling sound of phlegm all day long, spitting out continuously. By winter, when the north wind rises, the external cold is felt, and the water has even less ability to warm and transport, and more phlegm is produced. A slight exposure to wind and cold causes coughing, and with the obstruction of phlegm-fluid, the qi mechanism is reversed, causing wheezing and gasping, and a sawing sound in the throat. During the day, the phlegm mass is still in the lower part of the lungs, but when lying down at night, the phlegm-fluid spreads flatly over the upper part of the lungs, making the gasping even more suffocating. Wheezing makes it impossible to close the eyes, and one cannot lie flat, but must pile up pillows to seek relief. If the person's kidneys are deficient, then the qi in the dantian has no ability to absorb, and the suffering is even more unbearable. All those over the age of forty often have this symptom in winter, and their illnesses are all similar to the above. The source of the illness is the decline of yang qi, the inability to warm and transport, and there is no major problem in the body.

The treatment for this symptom lies entirely in the method of strengthening the fire and warming the yang. Stopping wheezing, moistening the lungs, and resolving phlegm are not the fundamental treatments for this symptom. If the patient wants to alleviate their suffering, they can often take aconite and fried rice flour in autumn or early winter. Mix two ounces of aconite and eight ounces of fried rice flour (that is, ordinary fried rice ground into powder) evenly. Those with mild symptoms should finish it in thirty days, and those with severe symptoms should finish it in fourteen days. Take one portion each day, either dry or mixed with boiled water, and it will have a very good effect. (Except for young people with phlegm-fire coughs who have a history of spitting blood, this is a miraculous cure for phlegm-fluid in the elderly.) In winter, it is advisable to take medicines that strengthen and warm the yang, such as aconite, cinnamon, ginger, ephedra, and lepidium seeds, to fundamentally cure this. Otherwise, the root of the disease will deepen year by year, becoming more and more severe, which is not advisable. Therefore, the time to regulate and treat is when winter is approaching. Once curled up in bed, the power of the medicine will be slower.

### External Diseases in Winter

— Zhang Zanchen

—Frostbite—When winter arrives, the weather is severely cold and the north wind is biting. Frostbite occurs on the human body in due season. The reason for this is mostly due to drastic changes in temperature, such as suddenly going from a warm room to a cold place, or using a stove to warm up immediately after cold work, or washing with hot water immediately after returning from heavy wind, rain, or snow, etc., which often leads to its occurrence. Also, like children and the elderly, those with insufficient nutrition and weak resistance, or those who like to be fashionable and wear less clothing, are prone to localized frostbite. This is because the blood feels the stimulation of cold, which continues to dissipate. Blood circulation is hindered by this, and the inner and outer membranes and skin are also damaged by this. Thus, frostbite forms abruptly.

Frostbite that starts in a localized area is first characterized by hot flashes, slight flushing, skin heat, subtle pain, and itching. Large ones can be divided into three stages: early, middle, and late. The first stage is the erythematous form, where the skin first appears pale, then turns cyanotic, purple, and swollen, with itching and burning. The second stage is the blister form, where the skin color is brownish-red and contains a liquid of dirty blood. If the blister ruptures, the epidermis peels off, becoming an ulcer and falling into a bad condition. The third stage is called necrosis, where the affected area is blue in color and the surrounding area is red. It hurts when cold and itches when hot. The wound is of varying depths, oozing water, and is a bad condition. In such cases, one should immediately consult a surgeon to prevent it from spreading and worsening.

The treatment for frostbite is to maintain the local temperature at the beginning, not making it too warm or too cold, and preventing it before it forms. If it has been lightly frostbitten, wash it with warm water several times a day, or rub the affected area with a gentle soft cloth to allow the blood to circulate and not stagnate, then it can dissipate without a trace. If it has already ruptured, then the treatment method is different from that of those that have not ruptured, because one should be warm and dispersive, and the other should be used to extract toxins and close the wound. Therefore, the treatment method after rupture must be divided into two stages. For initial rupture, use five cents of calcined gypsum, one and a half cents of cuttlebone, eight parts of indigo naturalis, and five parts of borneol, grind them together into a fine powder, and apply them with sesame oil. If the ulceration period has passed, change to using five cents of calcined gypsum, one and a half cents of stir-fried east dan, and four parts of borneol (ground into powder), mix with a little yellow petroleum jelly to form a soft paste, apply the paste on a piece of gauze, and stick it on to heal naturally, or use medicinal powder to sprinkle on dry, but all must be changed daily until it scabs over. Those in the world who are recuperating from frostbite should pay attention to this.

### One Aspect That Young People Should Pay Attention to in Winter

— Yun Shengcong

Young people who suffer from spermatorrhea experience more frequent nocturnal emissions in winter than usual. Upon investigating the reasons, there are several points: First, winter nights are longer than summer nights. As the saying goes, "There are many dreams every night." Many dreams are caused by not sleeping warmly, or because there is too much time and one does not want to sleep, or because the climate is severe and one falls asleep, forcing oneself into dreams, causing emissions. Second, bedding is used in winter, and warmth is always sought. Warmth covers and presses, making it easy to have more contact, which leads to hallucinations and dreams, resulting in illness. Third, there is less sweat and more urination in winter. Those with insufficient kidney qi urinate more at night, and cold air invades, unwilling to leave the bed to go to the toilet, suppressing in many ways. The bladder is full, pressing on the seminal system, causing it from internal stimulation. Fourth, due to the cold in winter, one does not get up immediately after waking up in the morning, lingering in bed and falling back asleep hazily. At this time, it is easy to develop this condition, so this condition occurs more often in the morning.

Based on the above reasons, those with spermatorrhea should pay attention to the following points in winter: (1) Drink less tea and water before going to bed to avoid increased urination and stimulating the seminal system. (2) The quilt covering the body should not be too heavy, and the feet should not be too warm. Some say that the feet should be exposed outside the bed, but this is not necessary. (3) When sleeping, avoid lying on your back, bend your lower foot and straighten your upper foot. (4) If you have the urge to urinate after waking up, urinate immediately and do not suppress it. (5) Whether early or late, get up immediately after waking up in the morning and do not linger in bed. Young people who are troubled by this condition should pay attention to this.

### Common Winter Diseases

— Yuan

Colds, chills, fever, nasal congestion, and runny nose are the most common ailments at ordinary times. During this winter season, the weather is severely cold. If clothing is not properly adjusted to the temperature, it is more likely to be affected. Generally, colds last seven or eight days, and runny noses and coughs last for half a month. Although they are minor ailments, they are often the initial symptoms of all feverish diseases (such as typhoid fever, febrile diseases, and damp-heat diseases). If the time for treatment is missed, or if it is not cured, it can easily become a chronic disease, and typhoid fever and febrile diseases can result from this. Therefore, one cannot neglect it as a minor ailment.

However, there are approximately three types of colds: one is a cold, which is very mild, merely a feeling of cold and wind. One is a chill, which is more severe, with a higher fever and symptoms of bone and joint pain. One is simply a fever, with no symptoms of aversion to cold. They are described in detail below:

(1) Cold: This is a feeling of cold and wind. When the nose is congested, there is a clear runny nose, a slight cough, body heat, a headache, and aversion to wind. The skin also has a slight gradual aversion to wind. Administer medicines that dispel wind and clear the lungs. One must wait until the cough stops as the standard. Taking medicine should not be abandoned halfway, because a slight cough remaining can easily lead to prolonged illness and damage the lungs.

(2) Chill: This is a feeling of cold, which is more severe than the former. The fever is steaming, there is a greater aversion to cold, no sweat, headaches, and very severe pain throughout the body or in the bones and joints. Or the neck is not very easy to turn. One must take medicines that dispel wind and cold, drink a bowl of hot water after taking the medicine, wrap oneself in a quilt, and sleep to induce sweating to heal.

(3) Fever: Initially, there is simply a fever, with absolutely no aversion to cold, body heat, dizziness, and pain, dry and bitter mouth, yellow tongue coating, lack of taste, and bowel movements are not very smooth. The color of the urine is red. This is the beginning of typhoid fever. If there is no aversion to cold, it is not necessary to heavily use the sweating method. One must use both dispelling and clearing the stomach and intestines. In the beginning, one can use the method of promoting bowel movements.

In general, most of the initial stages of all colds and fevers are of the above three types. Prescribing medicine according to the symptoms can be effective. At the beginning of winter, because the skin has not yet contracted and stabilized, it is easiest to catch a cold. Among those in the workforce, the temperature difference between the office and the home is too great, either with high-heat radiators or without heating equipment and deeply chilled to the bone, it is easiest to contract a feverish disease. It is also common for those who like to go out at night, sometimes sitting in warm rooms and sometimes venturing out into the cold wind, becoming more and more exposed to the cold, and sooner or later catching a cold or feeling ill.

Spring and Autumn

### Inside the Blockade

— Gu Rong

Last Saturday at three in the afternoon, as usual, I took the No. 1 public bus home, but when I arrived at Jing'an Temple, the intersection of Yuyuan Road was crowded with people. "What's going on?" "Special curfew!..." "We can't get through, what should we do?" Many people were clamoring like this. So the bus could only turn right, and I could only get off the bus involuntarily. The number of people detained at one point slowly increased, so the situation became more tense, and the noise became even more chaotic. "The last time only the cars were blocked, this time even people can't get through!" "I don't know when it will be open?" "Waiting for when! Better to go outside to have dinner, stay with relatives and friends or open a hotel." Almost everyone who was similarly affected was arguing like this. Although I was standing there calmly, I couldn't help but feel anxious and try to find a way. Finally, after having dinner at a friend's house, it was already eight o'clock, and after making more than ten phone calls to my home, I finally got through, and learned that it was open and passable. This was a welcome news, so I rushed home as fast as I could. In the alley, every household, big and small, was taking this serious issue as the center of their conversation, and everyone guessed that there might be another blockade. Sure enough, after nine o'clock, traffic was not allowed again. So the situation became tense again, but there was nothing to do, just wait quietly for tomorrow, maybe it will be open.

I didn't sleep well all night, and got up early in the morning to inquire about news, but the result was very disappointing. Except for foreigners, no one was allowed to pass. As a result, newspapers and letters were completely cut off. By nine or ten o'clock, the alley was crowded with people, because the iron gates on both sides were closed. Since movement was not free, at least speech was free to talk about, so I heard some students muttering: "Today is fortunately Sunday, how can I go to school!" People in the stores were complaining: "Business is ruined!" The adults of the families were worried about the issue of food, so that a few South goods stores, grocery stores, coal stores, food companies, etc., in the alley, which were unexpected, had particularly booming business. Before long, most of the stock had been sold. By the afternoon, almost everyone's greeting was "What are we eating today?" The answer was always: "Vegetarian!" There were also many young mistresses who were very good at adapting to the environment and using their time. Their idea was that since they can't go out, they might as well play mahjong for thirty-two rounds. We who are out every day, are now even more uncomfortable once we are under house arrest, we can only walk from home to the alley, and then go from the stores in the alley to the road. There are many, many people standing there, as if watching the fun. They all stay ten feet away from the barbed wire, watching the pedestrians and vehicles. When they get to the other side, they always have to "get a ticket", even foreigners.

Today I should go to school, but the road is blocked, so I can't go. Later, I learned that many people came out early in the morning to "negotiate", relying on the power of "Vitamin M", they were allowed to pass. Soon I got another news, knowing that from the opposite of Yuguang Village

### The Story of the Nunnery

— Qian Jiong

Recently, the "business is slack" in the nunnery, which can really be described as "deserted"! Even if there are a few pilgrims, they are only "seeking dreams" and playing "flower clubs", or a few old customers with white-haired old women. The nuns are really a little unmotivated.

Suddenly, today a white-faced scholar came, with "Tolick" rimless glasses on his nose, wearing a suit. The nuns felt a little "different" - because men rarely set foot in the nunnery, the abbesses also considered it "a rare commodity", but, thinking about it, they always felt that such a scholar coming to be a "pilgrim" seemed inappropriate. Otherwise, did he go to the wrong "yard"? This really confused the nuns!

After a cup of fragrant tea, our visitor made clear his "purpose" for coming to the temple, saying that it was because of the recent "slack business" in your temple, he specially brought "good news", to transcend all the abbesses, and leave the bitter realm of Buddhism early. The reason is that there is a "organization" in Shanghai that does not recruit "married women", and as for those who have already been hired and are not married, they are slowly embarking on the "marriage" road, which makes some old men in the "organization" angry, "just trained a batch", and then have to change another batch, damn it, it's really annoying to use women!" But, they think, if they don't use women, it doesn't sound good outside, if they use women, they have to give birth to children, "not focusing on work", so they simply hire a large number of women who will "never" have children, and only the abbesses are the most suitable. Our visitor finished speaking, and touched his chin with satisfaction, took a sip of fragrant tea, and waited for the nuns' reply.

The nuns are naturally ecstatic, but the pity is that the nuns are not qualified enough, and they are afraid that they will not pass the exam, so the nuns also have to go to school to study, and have to submit a high school "diploma".

Sure enough, as expected, all those admitted were nuns, and even if the nuns were "unruly" and had a little nun in their belly, the "nun's fetus" was "legitimate"; because they had never been "married"!

So, all the original nuns in China were searched clean, but because the nunnery is a good place - the "preparation organization" for female employees of the "organization", so a large number of new-style modern nuns - female students, all started to open temples!

Therefore, there are nunneries everywhere in China, and the nun business is particularly developed! Qianjia Lane can lead to Jessfield Road, so many people went to explore like Columbus discovered a new route. Of course, we are no exception. When we arrived at Jing'an Temple, we seemed to breathe different air, but it was too late to go to school, so we bought some things and came back, and went to bed early at night, preparing to go to that road to school early tomorrow morning.

When I arrived at school, my classmates all asked me with surprised eyes how I got out. I told them some general things. When I was in class, I was in the classroom, but I was worried about what would happen if I was not allowed to go.

### "At Least"

— Yu Bi

There was no dish for breakfast, so I wanted to buy some "candied fruit" to eat. When I took out a five-cent coin from my pocket, the clerk glanced at me contemptuously and said coldly, "At least ten cents."

The past is vividly in my mind. When my hometown fell and I fled to Shanghai the year before last, two or three coppers could still buy a package, but in the second half of the year it was "at least two cents"; in the first half of last year, it was changed to "at least three cents"; in the second half of the year, there was a panic of cents, and substitute coupons and stamps were rampant for a while, and it was immediately "at least five cents"; now it has jumped to "at least ten cents", the degree of rising is really amazing! "Candied fruit" is like this, what about other things, do I need to nag about it?

"At least", "at least", these words make people's heads ache when they see them. (Now the isolated island seems to be filled with tangible and intangible "at leasts") If we continue to "at least" like this, it will really be hard for us "at least people" who live on salaries.

### The Rat's Plea

— Su Nong

"I am a rat!

"But don't think that I am just a rat, I live in a luxurious house (although the house is almost collapsing, the furnishings are always luxurious): what's more, the owner here is still a famous "rich old man"!

"But don't envy me either, there is no reason to envy me; because, the owner is rich for himself, and I am the one who is "unlucky"! You think: how can a little bit of leftover food fill my stomach.

"Several times I was so hungry that I went to bite the owner's table, clothes... Unfortunately: not only did the owner not "understand" me, but he was furious, and even gave all the remaining rice grains to the pug! Ate it!

"After being "favored", the pug "frightened" and barked. I hated it so much that I secretly bit the dog's tail...

"This really annoyed the owner, who didn't know where to get three stray cats, guarding my hole all day long!

"So even my only "freedom" was taken away, I couldn't move; my stomach was hungry again...

"The owner smiled all day long; the pug jumped; the stray cat barked.

"Help! I can't live on..."

### Willow of Changtai

— Gu Mingdao

The Confucian scholar listened, and his face couldn't help but change color. The smile just now disappeared immediately, and he rubbed his hands frequently, and sighed: "If so, I can't say that your words are too fierce, too sharp, making me feel like I have thorns on my back, and my heart is sad. You are indeed a strange woman, how can you be regarded as a person from Changtai? The lacquer room woman of Lu is one of your kind. Haha, do you also have the insight of Hong Fu, and can you recognize a hero like Li Yaoshuai in this turbid world? As for me, I don't just know how to escape and be famous, and ignore national affairs. In the beginning, I was in the Fushe, and I asked myself that my love for the country was no less than anyone else. Only because Wei Zhongxian stole power, loyal and good people disappeared, and the hunt for conspirators spread all over the world, the victims and those who were exiled were almost all caught in one fell swoop. The so-called gentleman's way is declining, and the villain's way is growing, this is the general trend, and also the fate of the Ming Dynasty. Therefore, we mostly hold the pain of Ai Ying, and have to think about the Jianghu, and there is no other way but to do so, and how can we not worry about the state in our hearts? You know me well, and you must be able to understand me. Why do you say this today? It really hurts my heart." After saying that, he stomped his feet and sighed again. The beautiful woman said: "How dare this little girl hurt my teacher's heart? These days, I have read some of Xie Gao's poems, and I can't control my heart, so I boldly talked nonsense in front of my teacher. All plans for saving the country and survival are best done early and first. Subsequent remedies will definitely be more difficult. Fan Zhongyan's ambition to worry before pleasure is a good example for the scholar-officials of Chu. I deeply regret that today's scholars still can't earnestly save the country. I also hate that I am a woman, and my origin is humble, and I have the will but not the power. If I could transform into a man, I would definitely do something fiercely." The Confucian scholar slammed the table and said loudly: "If so, what you said is so straightforward! You can put the men to shame! I originally admired you for your talent and knowledge, which is not like ordinary women. Today's words, how many women can say? Admire, admire, you are really a strange woman. I want to congratulate you with a glass." After saying that, he quickly picked up the wine pot, filled a glass, raised it and drank it all in one gulp. The father filled a glass in front of the beautiful woman and said: "You have to drink this glass." The beautiful woman thanked him, smiled and drank, and also drank the glass of wine. The Confucian scholar's father poured some for Jiangzi and said: "You also drink half a glass to congratulate your sister." Jiangzi smiled, picked up the glass, and drank a few sips. (4)
