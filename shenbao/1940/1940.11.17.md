### America Will Not Yield in the Far East; British Battleships to be Stationed in Singapore; Takahashi's Mad Theories of Seizing All of East Asia; Says War Between US and Japan is Inevitable

Washington - Former Japanese Supreme Military Counselor and Admiral of the Navy, Takahashi, recently made remarks outlining the scope of the new Asian order, saying it starts from China's Northeast (Manchuria) and extends to Australia, west to the Bay of Bengal and Burma. Japan, according to its national strength and environmental needs, will gradually advance through Manchuria, China, Vietnam, Burma, the Straits Settlements, the Dutch East Indies, New Caledonia Islands, New Guinea and other Pacific islands, the Philippines, Australia and other parts of the East Indies. Takahashi also said that war with the United States is inevitable and cannot be resolved until Japan and the United States have a decisive battle. Japan is now determined to face a war with the United States. Without this determination, how could we have concluded the Tripartite Pact? If the United States wants to avoid war, it is not impossible, but it must abandon the Open Door Policy and recognize Japan's new order in Asia. People here, hearing these arguments, do not find them strange. One newspaper headline asked, "Is that all?" According to people here, Takahashi's statement of the Japanese Empire's dreams is clear, letting people know Japan's true purpose, unlike the vacillating behavior of ordinary politicians who sometimes advocate war with the United States and sometimes advocate peace. If Japan's plans are as Takahashi says, then the US-Japan war he foresees is indeed possible. Therefore, there is evidence here indicating that the United States will not abandon its current position on the status quo in the Pacific. Some well-informed observers say that the United States has obtained assurances that it will not yield in the Far East, and military commentators here also say that the serious blow suffered by Italy in Taranto will have a great impact in the Far East. Since half of Italy's main battleships have been destroyed, Britain can send a battleship fleet to Singapore. It is estimated that Britain has sixteen active battleships, and three more will soon be added. Therefore, Britain can now station three battleships at each end of the western Mediterranean, and five of the latest battleships will patrol the Atlantic Ocean, searching for enemy raiders and for general combat purposes, and transfer the remaining five to Singapore. Major Eliot, a famous American commentator, said that with this British support, the policy of Britain and the United States applying economic and naval pressure on Japan offers the best hope of clarifying the situation in the Far East and allowing the resources of Australia, Malaya and India to be supplied to the Middle East Army without interruption. General opinion here believes that the stationing of British battleships in Singapore will prevent people in the Japanese naval circles from making further pronouncements about seizing all of the East and including Australia in the Japanese Empire's territory.

Moscow - The "Red Star" newspaper published a lengthy article reviewing the recent international situation, stating that the most important event in the recent international situation was Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's trip to Berlin. Molotov's trip will allow for direct consultation and friendly exchange of views with German leaders, which will promote relations between the Soviet Union and Germany, and benefit both countries. Regarding Japan's withdrawal of troops from Nanning in the Far East, its increase in troops to Hainan Island and the Tokyo area, and Japan's demand to Vietnam to occupy Cochinchina and Saigon, these actions indicate that Japan intends to take action in the south. The establishment of the South Seas Affairs Bureau by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs also proves this trend. In order to cope with Japan's southward advance, Britain and the United States have taken new measures to strengthen their position in the South Seas. As a result of recent talks between Britain, the United States and Australia, the Pacific Joint Defense Treaty has been established. According to the views of foreign military circles, open conflict between the United States and Japan is only a matter of time. (15th telegram)

### Helping China Develop Industry; Yarnell Urges Americans to Host Fundraising Campaign

He said that this cooperative movement is sufficient to create a new stable area in the Far East and to revive the destruction of the Sino-Japanese War.

### Uruguay to be Built as a Giant Fortress; For the Defense of the Americas

Montevideo - Yesterday, the government here decided to rebuild Uruguay into a giant fortress for the defense of the Americas. After a large number of military preparations were approved in principle at the cabinet meeting, officials announced that all American countries, including the United States, could use Uruguay's key ports and base facilities to defend against foreign aggression. It is generally predicted that this great program will include the construction of countless naval, land and air military bases. When the project is completed, these bases "will be able to see each other." The program stipulates that it be implemented in the shortest possible time, and that a large number of artillery and other war materials will be deployed. It is believed that the adoption of this plan is a major step forward in completing the Pan-American defense plan. This plan was discussed and recorded at the Pan-American Conference several months ago. Although it had been agreed upon in principle by all countries at the time, this is the first time that a South American country has decided to implement this plan on a large scale.

Editorial

### Stabilizing the Far East Depends on This One Move

Regret, although the most painful thing, sometimes has educational value. What is valuable is that after regret, one suddenly changes course, catches up quickly, otherwise regret is useless, and even incurable. For example, in the Far East issue, since 1931, the democratic countries have consistently failed to prescribe the right medicine, resulting in step-by-step setbacks and failures in everything, and finally brewed a broken and chaotic situation, which is what the democratic countries regret today. With the belief that "forgetting the past is a guide to the future," this newspaper issued the proposal of "first settling the Far East" the day before yesterday, hoping that Britain and the United States will intensify their assistance to China and first eliminate the root of the disaster in the Far East. Observing the international dynamics of the past few days, I deeply feel that this proposal of this newspaper is not only reasonable, but also shows that this kind of possibility is already visible. In today's situation where wars in the East and West can continue to expand at any time, this may be a turning point in the development of the situation, and it is necessary to extend it further.

Originally, in the past three or four years, everyone in the world who holds good intentions has hoped that the democratic countries can unite to jointly sanction the forces of aggression. Even now, I dare say that there are still many people praying silently for the realization of cooperation between the four countries of China, the Soviet Union, Britain and the United States. As for the fact that the three countries of Germany, Italy and Japan have formed an alliance, the increased ties between the three countries of China, Britain and the United States have been seen in many actions. What is in doubt now is only the Soviet Union, especially on the day Molotov reciprocated his visit to Berlin, the world spread complex and confusing news. Among them, the most widely spread news, in terms of Europe, is that the Soviet Union will further assist Germany and Italy to resist Britain. In terms of Asia, it is that the Soviet Union and Japan will establish an agreement. Even more alarmingly, the general idea is that the four countries of Germany, Italy, Japan and the Soviet Union will jointly establish a new world order, and the first step will be to jointly destroy the British Empire in order to divide its territories and spheres of influence. All of this undoubtedly stems from the confusing position of the Soviet Union.

Although it is well known that Moscow diplomacy takes ruthless realism as its starting point, the actions of the Kremlin authorities sometimes inevitably make people feel unpredictable. If this phenomenon is viewed from a philosophical perspective, it may be said that it is because the fundamental position of ordinary observers is different from that of the Soviet Union, so it is very difficult to grasp the mindset of the people in Moscow. Only one thing can be considered certain, that is: the socialist Soviet Union led by Stalin is unwilling to be involved in the so-called "imperialist war" before it is directly invaded. Not only is it unwilling to be involved in the whirlpool of war, but it is even happy to watch the world's powers kill each other, so that it can carry out its plan for a worldwide socialist revolution in the future. This view may not be suitable for the true intentions of the Soviet Union, but the Soviet Union has its own reasons for incurring this suspicion. Based on this point of view, and then silently observing the general trend in Europe and Asia today, it may be inferred that the Soviet Union will continue to maintain the same attitude towards the wars in the East and West in the future. In other words, for the European war, the Soviet Union may continue to adopt a pro-German neutral attitude due to military, political, economic and even geographical considerations, in order to help the Axis powers overcome the difficulties in the current war with Britain, Greece and Egypt. For the Far East war, it will never change course because of Germany's instigation, abandon China and join hands with Japan. Even if it establishes a non-aggression pact with Japan, it will only, as this newspaper has repeatedly argued in the past, refrain from attacking each other for the time being in order to allow Japan to advance southward. At this moment, what decision Molotov has made with the German authorities regarding the European war is not within the scope of this article's comments, so I will not discuss it for the time being. Regarding the Far East part, although there is still no concrete expression from the Soviet official until now, at least TASS has issued two decisions in the past two days that we recognize: one, to recognize that an agreement has been established between the Soviet Union and Japan to divide the Far East spheres of influence and that the Soviet Union has agreed to stop aiding China; second, to add our approval to the fact that "Japanese Ambassador Tatekawa once invited the Soviet Union to join the Three-Nation Alliance, and exchanged British India for eastern Siberia." From this, it can be seen that not only is the rumor that Japan and the Soviet Union are about to cooperate not entirely credible, but also if Japan brazenly advances southward, there is no reason to believe that the Soviet Union can help it. This means that if Britain and the United States take tough actions in the Far East in the future, Germany and Italy will not be able to help Japan because they are unable to help themselves and are beyond their reach, and the Soviet Union may not change its consistent policy to attack China's comrades. Based on this, if China, Britain and the United States decide to jointly resolve the source of chaos in the Far East, even if the Soviet Union does not actively participate, it will at least not hinder it from doing so. Therefore, the practice of this major task will completely depend on the determination and efforts of China, Britain and the United States. There is absolutely no doubt about the firm resistance of the Chongqing government. The recent victories of the Chinese army on all fronts and the successive retreats of the Japanese army in western Guangdong and southern Guangxi are clear evidence that China is becoming more courageous and stronger in the war. In terms of Britain, the establishment of the Far East Military Region is indeed a major measure. Washington even observes that Britain can send five main battleships to Singapore, which may be the prelude to cooperation between the British and American navies in the South Pacific and Indian Oceans. As for the United States, in addition to increasing the defense of the Philippines, Secretary of the Navy Knox also made an amazing statement the day before yesterday, clearly stating that "the United States should aid China with the attitude of aiding Britain." Furthermore, seeing that General Mao Bangchu, commander of the Chinese Air Force, is going to the United States to negotiate the issue of material assistance, and that Pan American Airlines is planning to extend its routes to Hong Kong and Singapore, it can be seen that the United States will indeed consider providing further assistance to China as this newspaper suggested a few days ago. At a time when Tokyo is making all kinds of southward advances and news of the Japanese army landing in Saigon is frequently reported, the active attitude of Britain and the United States is indeed a "corrective" and a last-ditch effort to salvage the various mistakes of the past. I earnestly hope that British and American politicians from Roosevelt Churchill onwards will never repeat the mistakes of the past.

### Great Victory in Greek Warrior Counterattack; Italian Troops Withdraw from Korçë; Arson in the City Illuminates the Sky; This Battle Greatly Impacts the War Situation

Athens: According to reports from Greek outposts, Italian troops, who suffered from joint Anglo-Greek air raids and fierce attacks by Greek infantry, reportedly set fire to the important Albanian city of Korçë and withdrew from the city. It is said that the Italian troops deliberately burned the city before withdrawing. Last night, the city was ablaze, illuminating the mountains like a painting. (United Press dispatch of the 16th)

Athens: As a result of two fierce bayonet charges by Greek infantry, most of the rocky highlands northeast of Korçë have been occupied. This is the most courageous offensive since the start of the war. The Greek army's objective is a certain mountain 6,000 feet high. If they can completely occupy it, it will make it more difficult for the Italian army to defend Korçë. It is reported that the fighting in the Korçë area is extremely fierce and still ongoing, indicating that the Italian army is well aware of the importance of the battle northeast of Korçë and is therefore doing its utmost to defend its positions in order to cope with the Greek army, whose morale has been boosted by recent victories. According to a bulletin announced by the headquarters of the British Air Force in Greece, a convoy of Italian motorized transport vehicles moving in the area north of Korçë was bombed and heavily damaged by British aircraft with machine gun fire. In addition, an important bridge where Italian reinforcements were moving has been completely destroyed. A large number of troops were caught off guard, and the number of casualties is expected to be very high. (Reuters dispatch of the 16th)

Athens: Last night, it was reported that the Greek army's counter-offensive on various fronts continued to make progress. The Greek army captured several positions yesterday and captured hundreds of enemies. This decisive battle is on a larger scale than the initial stages of the war, and more troops are being used. The Italian army is now feeling the impact of the Greek army being able to move freely and unhindered. (Reuters dispatch of the 16th)

Athens: Greek High Command intelligence reported yesterday that in the infantry attacks and artillery battles on Friday, Greek troops captured 14 artillery pieces and captured more than 700 Italian soldiers. In addition, yesterday, the Athens radio station reported that Greek troops have completely surrounded Korçë, and the city may fall soon. The radio station continued that with the assistance of British and Greek aircraft, progress has been made on all fronts. There may not be significant resistance encountered in the battle of Korçë. The battle there has reached a point outside Salamas. British aircraft destroyed an important transportation bridge in Korçë on Thursday. (United Press dispatch of the 16th)

Athens: According to news that came out of here yesterday afternoon, Greek troops have made progress in the Kalamas area and have already crossed the Albanian front line. It is said that Italian troops are fleeing from Epirus towards the coast. According to news from Thessaloniki, the Greek army is making progress on the Korçë front. The report said that these advances have brought the elite Greek troops to within a few miles of Korçë. (United Press dispatch of the 16th)

Ohrid, Yugoslavia: Frontline news states that Greek infantry reached Mount Ivan last night and occupied the two villages of Alben and Kolobarada at the foot of the mountain. In the central region, Greek troops continue to pursue the Italian Third Army units near Mount Morica and Mount Pindus. Greek troops on the Albanian front have occupied several points, while Italian troops are fleeing towards the Leskovik road. (United Press dispatch of the 16th)

Joint Anglo-Greek Air Operations Heavily Damage Italian Naval Base

Ohrid, Yugoslavia: It is reported that Greek artillery fired on Italian troops in Korçë yesterday morning, resulting in 23 deaths and over 70 injuries. According to reports from the front, Anglo-Greek aircraft bombed the main Albanian seaports of Vlora and Durazzo yesterday morning. In Vlora, there was one death, and six in the latter. In Durazzo, there were 15 deaths, 16 injuries, and six houses were destroyed. It is also reported that an Italian warship near Durazzo was hit. A squadron of Italian aircraft flew to the Corinth Canal area around 3:00 PM yesterday and dropped many bombs, but failed to hit the railway bridge on the canal, which is the only passage between Attica and the Peloponnese. When Italian aircraft arrived in Athens, they began circling over the capital. Greek fighter planes shot down an Italian plane in Piraeus and another over the Gulf of Corinth. (United Press dispatch of the 16th)

Thessaloniki: Authoritative naval figures here stated yesterday that all Italian naval forces in the Aegean Sea have been completely wiped out by Anglo-Greek air and naval forces. In addition, due to joint operations by Anglo-Greek air forces, the movement of Italian troop transports in Otranto has been severely hampered. Currently, with the exception of a few Italian submarines, the military has Crete as a base of operations. It is reported that Anglo-Greek cooperation has cut off the supply lines to all three Italian fronts in Greece. (United Press dispatch of the 16th)

Invading Italian Troops Undergo Reorganization; Frontline Commanders Repeatedly Changed

London: After the Greek army entered Albania, it is now striving to carry out military sweep operations. Yesterday, the Greek army captured 700 people and many artillery pieces. According to sources in London military circles, the Italian side has a total of 200,000 to 250,000 troops and some military supplies in Albania, but if they cannot maintain their transportation lines with Italy, it is feared that they will not be able to carry out large-scale military operations in Greece. This refers to Durazzo, because 80% of the heavy military supplies from the Italian canals depart from there. The recent reorganization of the Italian army proves that the Italian army completely underestimated the strength of Greek resistance. The Italian army has now been divided into two armies. One will be commanded by General Vanselino, commander of mechanized units, and the second will be led by General Silosu. (Reuters dispatch of the 16th)

### Germany to Exert Significant Pressure on Turkey; Papen Returns to Post with New Proposals

Istanbul: The Turkish ambassador to Germany returned to the Turkish capital after Molotov's visit to Berlin. At the same time, the German ambassador to Turkey, Papen, also returned to his post. Turkish political figures believe that there will be important developments in Turkish diplomacy. (Haitong News Agency dispatch of the 15th)

Istanbul: Well-informed German sources recently stated that they expect German Ambassador to Turkey Papen to return here from Germany soon, carrying "certain proposals." However, the nature of these proposals is unknown. However, some political figures here believe that these proposals must be a request for Turkey to maintain strict neutrality when Germany assists Italy in attacking Greece. Greek figures here also believe that Germany may assist Italy, but say that it is actually beneficial to Germany if Turkey remains neutral. Well-informed sources also believe that if Germany assists Italy, its troops will pass through Yugoslavia instead of Bulgaria, because the Germans believe that if Bulgaria participates in the war, Turkey will also send troops to participate. A certain Bulgarian figure here said that Italy has asked Bulgaria not to interfere in the Italo-Greek war and warned the country to recognize the consequences of intervening in the Italo-Greek war. Therefore, Bulgaria has assured Turkey that it has no intention of interfering in the Italo-Greek war. In light of the reported proposals from the German side, people here are waiting with close attention for the return of Turkish Ambassador to Germany Papen to the Turkish capital. In addition, authoritative figures here all believe that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's talks in Berlin will not lead to a Soviet attack on Turkey. However, many people here feel uneasy about this. The "Akşam" newspaper here said that the Berlin talks should be viewed from the perspective of the Soviet Union's determination to maintain neutrality. (United Press dispatch of the 16th)

### U.S. Neutrality Law Applies to Italo-Greek War

Washington: President Roosevelt has applied the provisions of the Neutrality Act to the Italo-Greek war. This move does not affect the existing war zones, as the United States has not allowed ships to enter the Mediterranean for some time. (Reuters dispatch of the 15th)

### Spain Annexes Tangier; U.S. Protests; U.S. Considering Countermeasures to Spanish News Ban

Washington: The U.S. protested to Madrid yesterday after Spain forcibly occupied the Tangier International Zone. The U.S. is also considering countermeasures to Spain's ban on American news agencies from sending news from Spain since Monday. The nature of the protest over the Tangier incident has not been announced by the U.S., but it is understood that the U.S. has taken a firm stance against Spain's violation of the treaty, which made the zone an international territory. According to the 1928 Tangier Conference, the U.S. holds treaty rights there. In view of Spain's serious measures, informed sources believe that Spain's move may be a sign that it will share the fate of the Axis powers. The news ban in Madrid will take effect after Monday, at which time the international press, United Press, Associated Press, New York Times, and Chicago Tribune, and other American news agencies and newspapers will be prohibited from sending news from Spain. Although the implementation of this ban is a retaliatory measure against the expulsion of a reporter from the Spanish official news agency from the U.S., government officials here suspect that it serves other purposes. The general opinion is that General Franco's government wants to conceal everything that is happening in Spain at this time. (International News Service dispatch of the 16th)

### German and Italian Military Hold Talks

Berlin: Officials here announced that German and Italian military leaders met in Innsbruck yesterday to discuss joint combat issues. German General Jodl, General Jodel, and Lieutenant General Lintelun, military attache to Italy, and Italian General Baddoglio, Major General Gantim, and Lieutenant General Malas, military attache to Germany, participated. (Haitong dispatch of the 16th)

### British Government Makes Efforts to Promote Relations with the Soviet Union; Hopes to Conclude a Non-Aggression Treaty; Three Proposals Made, No Reply Received

London: According to Reuters' diplomatic correspondent, on October 22nd, the British side made a proposal to Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky through the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sir Cripps, which included (1) Britain's de facto recognition of the incorporation of the Baltic states into the Soviet Union; (2) Guaranteeing that the Soviet Union would be invited to participate in any post-war peace settlement; (3) Guaranteeing that Britain would never join any attack on the Soviet Union. So far, the British government has not received a reply. It is reported that Sir Cripps' proposal to the Soviet Union of these far-reaching suggestions was primarily to dispel misunderstandings and seek to establish a temporary agreement between Britain and the Soviet Union. The solemn guarantee provided by the British side that it would never ally with other countries or join other groups to attack the Soviet Union can be said to be the British side's suggestion to the Soviet Union to conclude a permanent non-aggression treaty. Of course, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov knew about this suggestion from the British side long before the invitation to visit Berlin arose. (Reuters dispatch of the 15th)

Stockholm, Sweden: In order to protest against Britain's detention of debts and deposits of banks in the Baltic states, the Soviet Union has now taken various retaliatory measures. The Soviet Union has now stopped paying the annual payment of £92,000 for the Linna Gold Mine and stopped paying the Riga City debt due on November 14th. In addition, the interest on the £10 million export loan in 1937 will also be stopped. Since the British government is the guarantor of this loan, the British government should pay the creditors on behalf of the Soviet Union. (Haitong dispatch of the 16th)

### German Youth Group Arrives in Hungarian Capital from Romania Yesterday

Budapest: Approximately 190 members of the "Hitler Youth" group arrived here yesterday from Bucharest. German expatriates and German embassy staff welcomed them at the station. On the Hungarian side, General Makarosei and representatives of the city council participated in the welcome. It is understood that the members of this youth group will stay here for two days. (Haitong dispatch of the 16th)

### Italian Prime Minister Receives Romanian Leader; Talks Last One and a Half Hours

Rome: Mussolini and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano received Romanian Prime Minister General Antonescu, who is currently visiting Rome, yesterday. The Italian Stefani News Agency said that the talks were held in a harmonious atmosphere, lasting one and a half hours, and discussed issues related to the relationship between Italy and Romania in the Axis political organization. (Reuters dispatch of the 16th)

Rome: Pope Pius XII met with Romanian Head of State Antonescu this afternoon. Antonescu was accompanied by the Romanian Ambassador to the Holy See. After his departure, he visited Vatican Secretary of State Maglione, who in turn paid a return visit to the Romanian Embassy this afternoon. (Haitong dispatch of the 16th)

Rome: Romanian Prime Minister Antonescu stated to reporters at a reception at the Romanian Embassy last night that Romania is determined to remain permanently loyal to the Axis powers. Antonescu went on to explain the reasons for Romania's opposition to the Vienna Award solution to the issue of Outer Transylvania, believing that at this historically significant time when Europe is establishing a new order, all special and complex issues should be left for later resolution. (Haitong dispatch of the 16th)

### Condition of Taranto Harbor After Bombing

London: The British Navy continues to send reconnaissance planes to Taranto to investigate the damage to the Italian warships. It is reported that two Cavour-class battleships are aground, and one of them is apparently beyond salvage. Another Littorio-class battleship appears to be about to begin salvage work. At the entrance to the repair dock, four submerged warships can be faintly seen. (United Press dispatch of the 16th)

Alexandria: According to airmen of the British Naval Aviation Corps who participated in the first attack on the Italian port of Taranto, the outer harbor was attacked, and the flames soared into the sky. The British planes disregarded anti-aircraft fire and swooped down to within 60 feet of the water surface to drop torpedoes. One torpedo hit a Littorio-class Italian battleship, and a fire broke out in the middle of the ship, reaching a height of 50 feet. (Reuters dispatch of the 16th)

### British Planes Fly Over Germany, Conducting Large-Scale Air Raids; Railway Lines and Docks Were Bombing Targets

London, Aviation Ministry announced that several squadrons of British bombers conducted large-scale air raids over Germany last night. Railway transportation, shipyards, docks, and public utilities were bombed, suffering heavy damage. (Reuters, 16th)

London, Last night, British air force bombers heavily bombed Hamburg's docks, oil factories, and other targets. Enemy airfields and seaports in occupied territories were also among the bombed targets. (Reuters, 16th)

London, The Aviation Ministry stated that on Thursday, Berlin's largest railway terminal and freight yards were heavily damaged by British air force night raids, further disrupting the already damaged German transportation system. Berlin is the most important railway hub in Central Europe, and damage affects not only Germany itself but also the transportation of all the countries it has ravaged. A British bomber pilot who attacked Berlin yesterday said that a terrifying explosion illuminated the sky in a certain area of Berlin. The land artillery temporarily fell silent, and the clear moon was perfect for bombing. (Reuters, 16th)

London, British air forces yesterday heavily attacked the German airfield within the borders of Caux and achieved success. The Aviation Ministry stated that a batch of Blenheim British bombers attacked airfields in France, hitting targets and causing fires in multiple locations on the runway. British planes also discovered an airfield with concealed planes and twin-engine bombers hidden in the forest, and bombed them. Furthermore, Blenheim and Hudson British squadrons bombed the Saint-Léger airfield northeast of Amiens, hitting many targets, and a train approaching the airfield was also bombed, damaging both the train and the railway. Hudson planes dive-bombed, with the first batch of bombs hitting the hangar, followed by another bombing that caused explosions and a large fire. In addition, Hudson British planes flying to Norway braved difficult weather to bomb the Stavanger airfield. Due to low-lying clouds, visibility was poor, but a batch of bombs appeared to have hit the armory. (Reuters, 16th)

### Residents of Lorraine Province Expelled; German Authorities Order Relocation; Refugees Flock to the Free Zone

Lyon, Since the 11th of this month, German authorities in the French province of Lorraine have ordered the relocation of residents of French descent from the province. Every day, trains carrying 6,000 of these refugees pass through here to the Free Zone. Most of these refugees were residents along the Franco-German border in 1914. They recently received a notice from the German authorities stating that they must choose between relocating to Poland or the French Free Zone. It is also heard that the German authorities have provided assurances that those willing to relocate to Poland can temporarily reside in their original locations. However, most people still decided to relocate to the French Free Zone and were forced to leave in a hurry within a few hours, preventing them from bringing their belongings. When they arrived here by train, their situation was pitiful. The train cars were adorned with the French flag and the Lorraine Cross flag, and several Red Cross doctors accompanied them to treat illnesses. The government also sent representatives to care for them and send them to various provinces in the south and southwest. (Havas, 15th)

### Little Change in Middle East War Situation

Rome, Today, the official communique released here stated that there was no change in the war situation on the various Middle East fronts. British patrol teams continued to operate around Medan, and the area was harassed by British artillery fire. (Reuters, 16th)

### Spanish Foreign Minister Invited to Visit Berlin Again; This Trip Will Determine Spain's Future Diplomatic Strategy; Ribbentrop to Meet Him in Southern Germany

Berlin, Spanish Foreign Minister Suñer, recently invited by the German government, departed from Paris yesterday afternoon for Berlin. (Haitong Telegram, 16th)

Madrid, The authorities here issued a brief communique announcing the news of Foreign Minister Suñer's visit to Germany. Official sources remained tight-lipped about this visit. The secretary of the Spanish Moroccan High Commissioner also accompanied Suñer. (Haitong Telegram, 16th)

Berlin, The news of Spanish Foreign Minister Suñer's visit to Germany was quite unexpected by most people, even those in political circles who are usually well-informed. According to reports from Paris last night, Suñer had already departed from Madrid and is expected to meet with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop tonight or tomorrow morning. German officials have adopted a reserved attitude towards Suñer's visit and have not even announced the location of the talks with Ribbentrop. Judging from the Berlin official announcement that the Spanish Foreign Minister will visit Germany but not Berlin, the location of the talks will not be in Berlin. It is widely rumored here that Ribbentrop will leave Berlin today for southern Germany. This is the third meeting between the Spanish Foreign Minister and the Germans in eight weeks. Suñer came to Berlin on September 16th as Franco's representative. According to Spanish newspapers, the negotiations will determine Spain's future diplomatic policy. Suñer was appointed Foreign Minister on October 17th. On October 20th, German Police Chief Himmler met with Franco and Suñer in Madrid. Three days later, Führer Hitler met with Franco and Suñer on the Franco-Spanish border. The Spanish officials did not disclose the content of Hitler's talks with Franco, only stating that "the two countries are connected by comradely friendship." However, the content of the negotiations can still be discerned. The third round of talks to be held will continue the previous negotiations, which have been ongoing for the past eight weeks. (Haitong Telegram, 16th)

Berlin, The "Berlin Rome Tokyo" magazine published an article reviewing the "African Question," believing that this issue has already been discussed when Hitler met with Mussolini, Pétain, and Franco. Africa is an extension of Europe, just as South America is an extension of North America. European leadership of Africa is the same as American leadership of South America. Both France and Italy regard their North African territories as extensions of their own territory. The Spanish national revolution also originated in the African territories. The French bombing of Gibraltar from Morocco and General Graziani's strategy in North Africa mark the beginning of a new era in Africa. Britain will be expelled from Africa. Spain will also recover Gibraltar, which was lost three hundred years ago. The British territories in Africa are not vital to Britain's survival, and Britain has not fully developed these territories. Britain advocates the "Open Door Policy" and argues that Germany will eliminate the natives to transplant the Germanic people. German officials have stated that Germany has no intention of colonizing and will develop the region with the assistance of the natives. (Haitong Telegram, 16th)

### Molotov Returns to the Soviet Capital; German Foreign Minister to Visit Rome

Moscow, At midnight on the 15th, Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov, along with several comrades, returned here from Berlin. From Berlin to the border, Molotov was personally escorted by representatives of the German government, including Department Director Tembo, Liaison Officer Stein, Hitler's adjutant Hess, and naval representative Steifeses. Those who greeted Molotov at the station included Soviet dignitaries Mikoyan, Kaganovich, Budyonny, Marshal Timoshenko, Chief of Staff Malizikov, and members of the diplomatic corps. The station was decorated with national flags, and the Red Army stood in formation to pay their respects. Those returning to the Soviet Union in the same train as Molotov included German Ambassador Schulenburg and the head of the German economic delegation to the Soviet Union, Schnarre. (TASS, 16th)

Moscow, Soviet Foreign Commissar Molotov recently telegraphed Hitler from the German-Soviet border to thank him, stating, "I am deeply grateful for the warm hospitality I received during my visit to your country. I hereby send my sincere thanks." Molotov also telegraphed German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, stating, "I am deeply touched by your gracious hospitality and send my sincere thanks." (TASS, 16th)

Basel, The Swiss Basler Zeitung reported that political and diplomatic circles in Rome expect German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop to visit the Italian capital soon, as Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's visit to Berlin has made it necessary for Germany and Italy to continue exchanging views. (Reuters, 16th)

### A Painful History of the European War (3): Three Protagonists in the French Tragedy; (1) Daladier, Outwardly Strong But Inwardly Weak

I further stated: "If you personally pen a letter, rather than have someone else do it, King Leopold will undoubtedly feel gratified, thus fostering a positive impression. In this precarious environment, I shall personally deliver this letter. You surely recall that he entrusted me with tasks last year. Such an approach is certain to inspire him. We must endeavor to handle all matters in this manner."

As we shook hands in farewell, Daladier replied, "Permit me to contemplate this further. I shall inform Courant (Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs) of my ultimate decision. You may consult with him at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs tomorrow."

The following day, Courant conveyed to me, "The Prime Minister has yet to reach a verdict. He suggests that we should not hasten. He stated in his own words, 'Let them (referring to the Belgians) stew a bit longer.'"

I could not bring myself to conclude the matter at this juncture. The peril involved was palpably immense. As I was unable to secure Daladier's endorsement through direct advocacy, I was compelled to resort to a strategy of circumvention. I resolved to visit Ponard, the Minister of Justice, Talbos, the Minister of Education and an old friend, and Reynaud, the Minister of Finance.

They almost unanimously asserted, "This is patently a matter of paramount import; it is manifestly unreasonable to keep King Leopold waiting in such a manner. Were we able to confer with Daladier again, it would be most advantageous; however, it appears to be rather cumbersome. He is exceedingly reluctant to have us inquire of him regarding matters of this nature until he has elucidated it to us. Why do you not consult with his confidante, such as Crabier (Daladier's Principal Private Secretary)?"

I therefore sought out Crabier. He comprehended my intention thoroughly and pledged his assistance. Nonetheless, it was not until three months thereafter that I returned to Brussels, and King Leopold remained without receipt of a letter from Daladier.

I could furnish copious elaborations regarding Daladier's conduct during the war years. However, given that it is extraneous to the matter I have just recounted, I shall refrain from doing so.

We may now inquire: "What fundamental values underpinned his governance? Into what manner of man had he transformed?"

In effect, he had become a dictator. He wielded all the vast powers of a dictator but achieved nothing of note. In spirit, he remained a democrat. I am firmly of the belief that his adoption of dictatorial methods was circumstantial and a temporary expedient. He hoped that on the day of France's victory, he could announce to the Parliament, "The French Republic and the triumph of human freedom have at last been attained. I am proud and believe that all past actions will be well-received by you all. Now I will retire."

Indeed, he was a dictator, but firstly, due to inherent flaws in his nature, his endeavors were ineffectual. He had not completely shed the trepidation stemming from the Sixth of February (the Paris riots), although in many instances, he had learned how to galvanize himself in the face of upheavals. He had rendered himself somewhat numb, repeatedly ruminating and pondering matters, delaying and procrastinating, hesitating and vacillating. And most egregiously, though nominally a dictator, in his conscience, he remained governed by democracy. This is, of course, his luminous aspect, and should not be withheld from mention. The multifarious oppositions arising from the dilatory democratic institutions converged upon him, rendering him helpless to extricate himself. On the one hand, he was unable to surmount the inertia of habit and various shortcomings. His lack of capacity to be likened to a genuine dictator stemmed from the fact that the innate goodness of a free people had not been extinguished within him, and he dared not drive free people as the tools of a tyrant.

Regrettably, while his capacity to be a genuine dictator was insufficient, he unwittingly acquired all the pernicious habits of dictators. He was ever suspicious of others, fond of solitude, and invariably persuaded that he was correct in all matters, that there was nothing in the world he did not understand. Those of steadfast character who dared to confront him directly and say, "You are mistaken," he most detested.

The most grave and intractable question is the following: "How did he perceive this war? Was it because he misjudged the situation that he ventured into it?"

A portion of this remains enigmatic, difficult to answer. However, I believe that within many mysteries, I can extract an answer to serve as a partial explanation.

Throughout his life, Daladier loathed war most vehemently. During the Great War, he enlisted as a private and fought in battle. An unshakeable conviction within his political ideology was this: "We must not once again involve the nation and its people in war as we did previously. We possess a superior understanding of the means to prevent war than our predecessors. If a war were to erupt despite our efforts, it would undoubtedly be because they did not loathe war as thoroughly as we do."

Until the fifteenth of March, 1939, he remained confident in his ability to handle all matters adeptly. This accounts for his lack of dissent regarding the Munich Conference. Subsequently, as our populace, clearly and overtly, demonstrated a willingness to sacrifice all in pursuit of war, he gradually came to realize that he possessed no art of preventing war. However, even at that juncture, he remained stubbornly attached to fleeting hopes, believing that a miracle might occur at the last moment.

After the outbreak of war, I venture to assert that the following notion must have been present within his mind: "It is truly unreasonable, yet who knows? Perhaps with the passage of time, the enemy will ultimately be defeated. We can defeat Germany through internal revolution within the enemy, or through their being exhausted, their economy or popular morale collapsing. Without much bloodshed, or even without any bloodshed, the whole world can once again savour the air of freedom."

To confront war with such a psychology, the outcome is predictable. As I declare this to the democratic nations of the world and to friends who cherish freedom and peace, my heart still aches.

Perhaps you might retort: "This explanation still fails to elucidate why Daladier, during his extensive tenure as Minister of National Defense, did not manufacture more aircraft and tanks. During the six months following the outbreak of war, he neglected to train troops, promote munitions manufacture, and adopt modern defense strategies modeled after the invasions of Poland and Finland. He is undeniably culpable of dereliction of duty."

Assuredly, he cannot escape his culpability. His descent into habitual drunkenness during this period was not without cause. It is said that he frequently consumed alcohol to stimulate his energy, and that the alcohol he consumed became increasingly potent. This may well be true, but I surmise that this was not a decisive factor.

Others claim that he indulged in women - particularly his dalliances with the Marchioness de Crussol. I fear that Daladier squandered too much time and energy on this woman. The lascivious anecdotes regarding actresses that Daladier and I jested about at the Comédie-Française in 1926 had long since vanished. What I deem more lamentable is that a baker's son from Orange should, by engaging in an affair with a marchioness, willingly become a captive in the world of social climbing. In such a state, Daladier simply exposed his weaknesses and provided others with opportunities to exploit him, a matter for profound regret. However, in my view, this, too, is of secondary importance.

I believe that women and generals, when compared, are of vastly disparate weight, and a distinction can be made forthwith. Daladier, who had once been a leader of the Popular Front and vehemently opposed war and militarists, gradually transformed into a loyal servant of the military. Overcome with frustration and resentment in the wake of defeat, he confined himself within the desolate-seeming Ministry of War, where he was in constant contact with boisterous military men. He heard only the voices of officers. He found them amenable and endearing, unlike the criticisms levelled against him by public opinion. The voices of these officers were measured, prudent, even ingratiating, with every word and expression conveying respect, longing, and adoration. Daladier was simply narcotized by them. (End)

continued dropping high-explosive bombs and incendiary bombs. Residences, shops, and factories suffered considerable damage. Fires broke out in some areas but were quickly extinguished. Casualties among the population were minimal. There was little German aircraft activity in other areas, and damage and casualties were minor. Yesterday, another enemy fighter plane was shot down. Two enemy bombers were destroyed during the night raid on London. Therefore, the total number of enemy aircraft shot down yesterday was twenty. Two British fighter planes went missing, but the pilots were safely rescued. (Reuters, 16th)

London, Coventry, an ancient city and aircraft manufacturing center in England, and its surrounding areas were bombed by German planes last night, causing at least a thousand casualties. Extensive damage occurred everywhere. The sight was one of terrifying ruins. Rescue teams and firefighters are working hard to restore order on the surface. This ancient city in the Midlands, historically known for the legend of Lady Godiva riding a horse, is now desolate and filled with ashes after the disaster. It is estimated that 500 German planes participated in the air raid, bombing for ten and a half hours, dropping thousands of bombs. Although the area of destruction is vast, officials still claim that the damage to major military factories is minimal. The Aviation Ministry announced that British anti-aircraft fire prevented German planes from accurately bombing large aircraft engine factories and other factories. This air raid is the most devastating disaster that England has suffered. Tens of thousands of Coventry's 167,000 residents are now homeless, wandering aimlessly in streets filled with bomb craters, a pitiful sight. Charity workers from all areas around Coventry were mobilized to move most of the city's homeless residents out of the city. This "man-made earthquake from the sky" destroyed four crowded public air-raid shelters, as well as hospitals, hotels, theaters, churches, shops, clubs, schools, and other buildings. The majestic St. Michael's Cathedral, a medieval building, was also destroyed in this catastrophe. (International, 16th)

Coventry, After the German bombing of Coventry, a city located in the center of England, this Thursday night, the city is scarred and scarred, and only the spire of Coventry Cathedral still stands tall, as if on duty to guard the desolate scene. From dusk to dawn that night, there were few times when the sound of bombs falling to the ground was not heard for more than two minutes. Twenty-five or more enemy planes launched air strikes in turns in the first six hours of the attack, dropping hundreds of various bombs over a wide area. The moonlight was very bright, so in addition to burning bombs, enemy planes also dropped flares, so the whole city was in a red light. The land's anti-aircraft guns fired incessantly, and the enemy planes flew very high in the sky and could not drop bombs accurately. The enemy planes flew away after a night of mad attacks. At that time, several fires had not been completely extinguished. British Home Secretary Morrison visited the disaster area yesterday and was deeply moved by the courage and cheerful spirit of the residents in the face of such hardship. Most shops did not open for business today. Twelve incendiary bombs fell on Coventry Cathedral. Dean Howard led the crowd to put out the fire, but the second batch of incendiary bombs fell like rain, aided by bombs. The dean was helpless and the whole church was destroyed, leaving only the spire standing tall. The church was built in the 14th century and is one of the most precious models of stereoscopic architecture in England. The spire rises 300 feet, and all of its 15th-century glass had been moved to a safe place some time ago. In addition to the church, three other churches and a library with a rich collection of books were also destroyed. (Reuters, 16th)

### Rice Market Completely Speculative; No Longer Based on Actual Arrivals, Inventory, and Sales; Parasitic Merchants and Speculative Households Stir Up Trouble

The price of foreign rice fluctuated yesterday, but with more buying than selling, the market price continued to rise. Based on inventory sources and actual sales, the market should have fallen yesterday, but the rice market has long been in a speculative atmosphere, completely manipulated by hoarding merchants and rice parasites. In the early morning market, the situation was still flat. Because of the rebound after yesterday afternoon's rise, people were inevitably wary, and many wanted to sell their profitable goods at a high price. Therefore, there was more selling than buying, and prices fell slightly. However, after this short decline, general speculative merchants and rice parasites took the opportunity to become active again. The situation suddenly became lively again. Speculative households, unaware of the underlying causes, echoed the trend and blindly followed suit. As a result, the market turned from weak to tight, and prices rose steadily. The market was pushed higher and higher. The morning close was up by one yuan. In the afternoon, it continued to rise by 70-80 cents. At the late close, it returned to a flat 50-60 cents. As a result, it was still a bit higher than the previous evening. However, the spot price of some rice was only slightly higher by 30-50 cents. The market was chaotic and inconsistent. The price of Red Real Pagoda No. 2 rice opened at 69 yuan, fell to 68.60 yuan, and then gradually rose to 69.50 yuan at the close. In the afternoon, it once rose to 70.02 yuan, closing at 69.70-80 yuan. KG spleen was 67-8 yuan in the morning, 68.8 yuan in the afternoon, and still only 68 yuan at the close. Saigon spot of Round-trip No. 1 was 86.8 yuan, extra high 88.5 yuan, November 82.5 yuan, December 81 yuan. Round-trip No. 2 spot was 83.5 yuan, November opened 78.5 yuan to 80 yuan in the morning, up to 70.09 yuan in the afternoon, and closed at 70.05 yuan. December opened 76.3 yuan to 77 yuan in the morning, up to 78 yuan in the afternoon, and fell slightly by 30-50 cents, with a lack of buyers. Market prices fluctuated inconsistently, completely due to manipulative behavior. However, the issue of sellers raising prices for pre-orders was confirmed by continued transactions. New transactions included 1,000 tons of small fine rice sold by the Rixing Company for 75.8 yuan. The total volume of rice traded throughout the day was over 10,000 bags. Over 1,000 tons of original packaged rice were also returned.

As for price stabilization, despite various publicity campaigns in newspapers, the reality is different. It is rumored that no action will be taken until the rice price rises to a level that satisfies the expectations of rice merchants and speculators. Therefore, the chaos in the rice market is due to this, and the stability of rice prices is unlikely. As for the addition of a certain percentage of interest, if calculated based on the current purchase price, the interest earned by rice merchants and speculators is immeasurably high. What they excel at is creating smoke and mirrors, spreading rumors, deceiving the world, stealing names, and grabbing extraordinary profits.

New Japonica rice, green rice, wild rice, and other arrivals continued to total over a thousand shi, and retail sales were still brisk. Therefore, the market has repeatedly increased. Yesterday, new Japonica original package opened at 93 yuan, 90 yuan, 89.50 yuan per hu, 87 yuan, wild rice 93 yuan, 90 yuan, green rice original package 90 yuan, 87 yuan per hu, and Dujian 77-8 yuan per hu.

Over a thousand bags of Hong Kong glutinous rice arrived in port. Only a small amount of local glutinous rice was available on the market. Therefore, the local glutinous rice market was better, rising by about one yuan. The price of foreign glutinous rice was similar. Yili white opened at 84 yuan, Chang Dan white 82-3 yuan, Hong Kong 76-74 yuan, and Nuo Cha was reduced from 66 yuan to 64 yuan.

The number of corn shipped from places such as the West and Real Estate was small, and sales in the local port were limited. Yesterday, 1,000 bags were shipped to Weihaiwei and 2,000 bags to Yantai.

### Newly Arrived Foreign Flour Already Being Traded

The flour market was mediocre yesterday. The price of No. 1 flour from the factory remained at 17 yuan, and the market price was 18.5 yuan, unchanged for the time being. Fuxin and Fufu factories sold over 8,000 bags of the old Car Fuxin brand. The newly arrived foreign flour has also been traded, with local merchants taking over 3,000 bags. Because the quality of the goods is not very high, the price is between 18.5 yuan and 70 cents. It is said that new batches of flour are constantly arriving, so it is difficult to expect the market to improve. Transactions for return and foreign flour were quiet, with no agreements reached for the time being.

The wheat market remained scarce in both supply and demand. The amount of wheat in the market was small, especially the amount of wheat stored in concessions. The selling price was 26-7 yuan. It is said that recent arrivals were all directly delivered to factories, so market transactions remained quiet.

### Financial Commentary – November 16th – The Future of the Bank of Japan's Issuance – Saint Keyes

The financial commentary in July discussed the inflation of the Japanese currency system and, compared the banknotes of the three major Japanese banks with the currency system at the end of June this year, explaining the inflationary situation. Until recently, it has been difficult to collect all the issuance figures of the Japanese currency system at the end of September, and we will analyze them in the future. However, recent reports from Tokyo, when combined, reveal that the issuance of Bank of Japan banknotes is heading towards a terrible and extremely vicious inflationary path. There is no need to investigate the entire Japanese currency system to find this out.

First, the amount of Bank of Japan banknotes issued has been hovering around 330 million yen for some time. In September of this year, it was still 330.3 million yen, but on October 1st, it increased to 350.79 million yen. On the 11th, it decreased to 340.36 million yen, but by the end of the month, it increased again to 370.53 million yen, creating the highest record in Japanese financial history. Although the issuance amount for this month is unknown, judging from this fluctuating trend, if it continues unchanged, it is very likely to break the record again.

Secondly, at the National Financial Discussion Conference, Bank of Japan Governor Yuki stated, regarding the gold issue: The function of gold as the basis for domestic currency has lost its importance, while the function of gold as a means of settling international payments will become increasingly important in the future due to changes in internal and external situations. There is a general argument that the Bank of Japan's convertible note issuance system should be re-examined. This means that the Bank of Japan's note issuance amount will inevitably increase its inflation rate further by the end of the year. Therefore, there is a general argument that, in order to adopt the highest issuance system and other possible currency management measures, the issuance system must be fundamentally reformed. Since major countries around the world have abandoned the gold standard, severing the relationship between gold and prices, the Bank of Japan's reserves are considered no longer important domestically. Part or even all of the gold reserves can be rolled over into the exchange fund to expand exchange sales. In the future, the goal will be to revise the exchange regulations and reform the issuance system.

The Bank of Japan's vicious inflation has already been proven as a fact. At the same time, the Bank of Japan Governor is well aware that the end of this year will inevitably lead to an extreme and vicious situation. Therefore, at a time when the Nazis claim that gold is useless, they want to fundamentally reform the issuance system and transfer the questionable cash issuance reserves to the exchange fund. Transferring this questionable gold reserve, worth 500 million yen, to the exchange fund would of course be beneficial for Japan in terms of foreign exchange and trade, for lacking foreign exchange support and increasing the purchasing power of military supplies, from the perspective of strengthening aggressive actions. However, how to fundamentally reform the issuance system by using the highest issuance system and other possible currency management measures is worth examining. (To be continued)

### Exchange Market Dominated by Rumors

In yesterday's foreign exchange market, HSBC's listed prices did not fluctuate. The black market for British and American exchange rates suddenly tightened again, with uncertain trends. Even operators found it difficult to predict. Halfway through the day, initially, speculators broadly offered over a hundred thousand US dollars, causing the price to reach 5.96875 yuan. It was difficult to sell, and British exchange banks did some trading at 3 pence 8125. At that time, foreign banks were rarely active, with only some British gold merchants releasing Indian exchange. Around 11:15, rumors spread that a certain party had intentions towards a certain court and the issuance of treasury bonds, all baseless rumors. As a result, people believed there was a profit motive, stopped selling, and started buying. Hong Kong telegram speculators were the most active. As a result, the British gold closed at 3 pence 75 and the US exchange rate at 5.875 yuan, which was 0.03125 tighter than the previous British and 0.0625 tighter than the American.

Sharp Tightening at Noon

The central government's listed rates remained the same. Banks opened the spot selling price in the morning, with British gold at 3 pence 78125 and US exchange at 5.9375 yuan, which was flat compared to the previous day's late close for both British and American exchange rates. After opening, the market was slightly firm. It was reported that a foreign bank made an initial offer of British currency at 3 pence 8125. Also, Huaxing did an interbank trade of US exchange for this month at 5.96875 yuan. The silver equalization tax was announced and fell by 0.025. After that, it temporarily stabilized. However, around 11:00, speculators and Hong Kong telegrams came to buy, and the underlying trend tightened. It was reported that spot US exchange for speculators and others entering foreign banks reached 5.9379 to 90625 yuan. At the same time, Hong Kong telegrams settled British currency into foreign banks at 3 pence 75. By noon, foreign banks offered spot US exchange at 5.90625 yuan, but it was difficult to settle before closing. As a result, British gold, both spot and futures, closed at 3 pence 75, and US exchange at 5.875 yuan. In the afternoon, there was no market on Saturday. Compared to the previous day's close, the British gold spot rate was reduced by 0.03125, December softened by 0.015625, and the US exchange rate was uniformly tighter by 0.0625.

### Affected Equally by the Exchange Market: Gold Prices Rebound, Breaching the 5,700 Yuan Mark

Yesterday, in the black market for refined gold, the initial trading was sluggish. However, at noon, there was a sudden surge. Amidst dual rumors, prices broke through the 5,700 Yuan mark. The foreign exchange market reported tight conditions, stirring up excitement among various parties. The morning opened rather flat at 5,650 Yuan. Due to a slight easing in foreign exchange, small money shops eagerly covered their short positions, while silver firms released substantial amounts, causing the price to briefly dip to 5,640 Yuan. However, around 11:15 am, rumors about treasury bonds and court issues surfaced, tightening the foreign exchange market amidst speculative buying. Exchange brokers re-entered the market, and gold firms scrambled to buy, pushing the price up to 5,710 Yuan, eventually settling at 5,708 Yuan, a rebound of 58 Yuan. The half-day trading volume totaled 4,000 taels. In the afternoon, due to the Saturday closure, the spot price was nearly 10 Yuan lower than the forward price. Swaps saw buyers offering a discount to sellers, dropping from 13 Yuan to 10 Yuan. Gold ornaments rose by 10 Yuan, reaching 590 Yuan. Customs gold and other items remained stable.

Refined Gold Rises by 58 Yuan

The morning opened with a stable-to-firm exchange market, making it difficult for gold prices to rise. Silver firms offered securities at 5,650 Yuan for 10 taels. Gold firms then exerted pressure, offering 30 taels of securities at 5,645 Yuan. At this point, cash shops began buying, slightly improving prices. Cash shops took 20 taels from gold firms at 5,679 Yuan. Later, securities firms and silver firms leaned towards selling, causing a sharp drop to 5,640 Yuan. However, as the foreign exchange market gradually softened and positive news spread, gold firms and silver firms aggressively searched for gold, soon pushing prices past the 5,700 Yuan mark. Gold firms took 20 taels from securities firms at 5,705 Yuan, and another 30 taels from silver firms at 5,700 Yuan. The highest price seen by silver firms trading with each other reached 5,710 Yuan. By the noon closing, cash shops were selling 20 taels to silver firms at 5,708 Yuan, a rise of 58 Yuan compared to yesterday's closing. The price fluctuated by 70 Yuan during the half-day. Spot gold firms sold their own-brand gold at a price more than 10 Yuan higher than refined gold, and bought it back at 30 Yuan lower. Bids for standard gold were listed 50 to 60 Yuan lower than the listed price, with little activity.

Gold Ornaments Listed 10 Yuan Higher

The selling price of gold jewelry per tael at major silver shops was initially listed at 580 Yuan by both Datongxing and Xintongxing. At noon, it rose by 10 Yuan, reaching 590 Yuan. The buy-back price was reduced by 30 Yuan, it was said.

### Foreign Currencies Rise

Yesterday, the foreign currency market saw prices trending upward amidst various rumors. British and American gold pounds each rose by 2 Yuan. British gold drafts saw little trading, and market prices remained stagnant. American gold drafts initially retreated to 16.43 Yuan, but due to intense rumors about currency circulation, the black market for US dollars tightened suddenly. The price of American drafts rose as high as 16.75 Yuan in the afternoon, a jump of 0.25 Yuan compared to the previous day's closing. Hong Kong drafts rose by 0.03 Yuan. Japanese gold drafts initially rose and then fell, ending the evening at 1.53 Yuan. Korean drafts remained unchanged at 1.18 Yuan.

### Reducing Interest on Savings Accounts, Increasing Staff Allowances—Leisurely and Carefree

The decision of banks to reduce interest on current accounts was originally intended to encourage depositors to consider fixed-term deposits, transforming savings into fixed investments to support domestic construction. However, the interest rate reductions by various banks have largely been diverted to operating expenses, such as increasing allowances for staff. While employees in various industries and businesses also receive allowances, none are as generous as those of bank employees. The measures adopted by various banks to increase staff allowances include providing allowances based on the Shanghai Municipal Council's cost-of-living index, calculated according to salary amount, and providing rice, coal, or housing subsidies based on the number of family members in Shanghai. It is reported that a certain banking association plans to collect information on allowance measures from various banks to formulate a unified approach for reference. It is often observed that bank employees tend to be condescending towards customers, forgetting that their livelihood indirectly comes from these very customers. (Shou)

### Gold Production Increases, Expected to Reach 350,000 Taels This Year

Chongqing Dispatch: According to news from Chinese gold mining authorities, gold production is expected to reach 350,000 taels by the end of December this year, a sevenfold increase compared to pre-war production levels. Ninety percent of this amount is derived from panning in gold-bearing sand. Additionally, two significant new gold sources were discovered this year, one in Huitong, Western Hunan, estimated to contain 100,000 taels, and another in Jiangjin County near Chongqing, estimated to contain 50,000 taels. Gold mining authorities have been established in the provinces of Xikang, Sichuan, Qinghai, Henan, and Hunan. Recently, agencies will also be established in Guangxi and Yunnan provinces.

### Banks in Beiping to Reduce Interest Rates

Beiping Dispatch: Commercial banks are planning to reduce interest rates on current accounts, similar to the measures taken by banks in Shanghai, due to an increase in current deposits and limitations on their utilization. This interest rate reduction is expected to be implemented soon.

### Silver Bars Drop in Both Near and Distant Terms

London, 15th: Silver bar market prices for both near and distant terms fell by 0.0625. Market conditions were flat with little trading. Prices stabilized after the market closed. The price of American silver was flat for both spot and forward. Indian silver in Bombay was down by one anna for both spot and forward. Market conditions were flat, with a total of 15 contracts traded.

### Exchange Rate and Discount Rate Stabilize

Yesterday, the discount rate for exchange bills tended to stabilize at 4 yuan per thousand, with an offer rate of 5 yuan, the same as the previous day. The Shanghai Money Dealers Association's interbank lending rate was one point lower. Both morning and afternoon markets were quoted at 6 points.

Oil Cakes

### Sluggish Actual Sales in the Oil Market

Yesterday, due to a lack of new stimuli, the oil market in Shanghai was quiet. Apart from distant-term crude oil being tightened by speculators by about a yuan, the remaining prices were ordinary and mostly unchanged. Trade in soybean oil was weak in both buying and selling. Yesterday, a total of 50 cases of Jiaozhou soybean oil were traded at a price of 76 yuan, 30 barrels of Dalian soybean oil at 111 yuan, 200 cases of Jiaozhou crude oil at 74.15 to 74.5 yuan, 50 barrels of Qingdao crude oil at 103.5 yuan, 200 barrels of November futures at 103 to 103.5 yuan, 800 barrels of December futures at 104.25 to 105.75 yuan, and 200 cans of Yantai canned crude oil at 106 yuan.

Securities

### Physical Goods Flow Out, Public Bonds Have Difficulty Rising

The security black market saw two price increases yesterday but remained weak overall. There were also rumors of treasury bonds being issued, but the market was clearly divided into bulls and bears, each with their own reasons. Observing the market trends, large investors continued to sell, and banks also saw a flow of physical goods. Based on these observations, it is difficult for market prices to rise. However, buyers also possessed considerable strength, which cannot be ignored. Before any official announcement is made, this financial fluctuation is likely to remain in a state of chaos. Yesterday morning, Shunchang continued to buy over 100,000 units, and Lianyi and Tongshun also purchased a significant amount. The market price of Category C shares reached 1.6 yuan again, but Tongkang continued to sell a large volume, and Xieda and Yitai also released shares, causing the market price to slowly decline, although to a lesser extent than the previous day. However, Category A shares remained firm. In the afternoon, Houda bought over 200,000 units, and Hongda also made substantial purchases. Other firms like Yongkang, Lianyi, and No. 35 also made purchases, but with Tongkang still selling heavily and Tongshun and Lianhe also selling quickly, the market price ultimately weakened. As a result, apart from Category A shares, which rose slightly by 0.05 yuan, the rest retreated by 0.1 to 0.3 yuan. The total transaction volume was estimated at 1.7 to 1.8 million yuan. A simplified table is provided below.

Stock Trading: 100 shares of stock exchange shares were traded at a price of 29 yuan.

London, 15th (Friday): Today, the listed prices of Chinese foreign debt and Far East British companies' stocks remained flat, with no changes in prices.

### Ewo Yarns Declares Dividend and Will Issue New Shares

Jardine Matheson & Co., Ltd., manager of the Ewo Cotton Mills, Ltd., announced that the gross profit for the first half of this year (ending June) (including 1,229,597.33 yuan carried over from the previous period) totaled 10,901,031.97 yuan (depreciation and amortization not deducted).

The subscription period for local shareholders ends on December 20th, with a slight extension for shareholders in other locations. It is understood that these new shares will have the same rights as the existing ordinary shares, and will be entitled to the same final dividend for this year.

Yarn and Cotton

### Raw Material Supply Unresolved, Yarn Factories Not Opening for Sale Soon, Shuangma Resumes Rising by 20 Yuan Yesterday

The yarn market is trending upwards, and the bullish sentiment is strong. This is due to the continued and persistent demand for existing yarn from Hong Kong traders, as well as purchases of 20-count Shuangma yarn. This has boosted confidence, and short sellers are actively covering their positions in response to the improving environment, gradually pushing prices forward. Some say, why are the factories not opening for sale? In reality, the problem of raw material supply cannot be resolved quickly, so sales are temporarily impossible. Yesterday, 1,625 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.

The market for existing yarn opened with a moderate sentiment. The afternoon of the previous day had already turned positive, resulting in fewer sellers in the market. The initial bid price for 20-count Shuangma yarn was 1,245 yuan. At the same time, prices for foreign cotton rose, attracting a larger number of bullish buyers. The price quickly rose to 1,255 yuan, but then eased slightly as the foreign exchange market opened quietly, with some profit-taking, retracing a few yuan to fluctuate between 1,247 and 1,248 yuan for a long time. Later, it was learned that actual sales to Guangdong traders were not weak, and prices rose again, closing at 1,262 yuan, a rise of 20 yuan. According to statistics, a total of 6,070 bales were traded during the half-day. Prices for 10-count Shuangma yarn rose by 20 yuan. The amount of yarn purchased by each trader group is listed below: Hong Kong: 1,170 bales, Local traders: 4,900 bales.

The sentiment for Shuangma yarn was particularly good in the afternoon. It is said that transactions at the Yarn and Fabric Exchange reached 1,266 yuan.

### Impasse in the Cotton Market Difficult to Break

The situation for existing cotton is good. Recently, the mills' demand has not developed, so the sentiment is moderate. However, the bullish trend for foreign cotton continues, while the sources for local cotton are still not entirely smooth. The overall trend in the cotton market remains in a stalemate.

Foreign Cotton Market Prices: The New York cotton market has been particularly active recently, first due to purchases by speculators, then due to searches by traders. As a result, closing prices were 14 to 15 points higher compared to the previous day. Indian cotton, including forecasts, also rose by more than 3 rupees.

Shanghai Foreign Cotton Trade: Trading in Shanghai has remained extremely quiet recently. All parties are taking a wait-and-see approach. The mills are temporarily not interested in buying, while traders are unwilling to sell at low prices due to the difficulty in sourcing foreign cotton. As a result, there are no transactions between the two parties.

Piece Goods

### Active Trade in Cotton Cloth

The cloth market opened flat yesterday morning but strengthened considerably in the afternoon. Trade on Wood Street and in retail outlets was active. Sales of cotton cloth priced in legal tender were mixed, with plain cloth remaining flat while fine cloth and twill rose by 0.25 yuan. Colored cloth and bleached cloth also saw slight fluctuations. Factory prices were 0.5 to 1 yuan higher per piece than spot goods. On this street, 800-odd pieces of grey cloth, flannelette, and bleached and dyed cloth were traded. Guangdong and Hong Kong traders handled 100-odd pieces of striped cloth, colored cloth, and bleached cloth. Zhejiang, Ningbo, and Yong traders handled 200-odd pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, and bleached cloth. Overseas, Siamese and Singapore traders handled 5,000-6,000 pieces of striped cloth and bleached cloth. On the 16th, 1,410 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong.

The atmosphere in the East Piece Goods market turned firm. The closing price for fine cloth from the White Goods leader was 35.75 yuan, and for serge, 1.0925 yuan. In the afternoon, due to the market closing at six, the black market trade among traders rose again. Fine cloth such as Longtou traded at 36 yuan, and Sijunzi serge at 2.1 yuan, trending upward.

Sugar Market

### Sugar Prices Continue to Weaken

Yesterday, the sugar market continued to weaken. The current prices for public chartering and existing goods were: Grade 2 Raw Sugar 72.5 yuan from the outer warehouse, Taikoo Granulated White B Mark 74.8 yuan from the western warehouse, down 0.2 yuan, 74.5 yuan from the eastern warehouse, DY Mark 69 yuan from the western warehouse, 68.8 yuan from the eastern warehouse, HX Mark 68.7 to 68.5 yuan from the eastern warehouse, and Dutch Red Sugar 55.9 to 56 yuan.

Metals

### Antimony Prices Continue to Rise

The market for Antimony (i.e., the common term for domestically produced pure antimony) was generally attractive yesterday, because the remaining inventory was not high, and the sources from Hong Kong were not abundant. Therefore, the belief of manipulating the market by the traders came into being, causing the listed prices to rise again and again. Yesterday, the market price had risen to 8,600 yuan per ton, which was an increase of 200-300 yuan compared to the previous. However, the actual sales became sluggish because of the sharp increase in prices. The market was only seeing inquiries and quotations.

### Third U.S. Evacuation Ship: The Washington to Arrive in Shanghai Today; Despite its Size, the Ship Will Enter [the] Port; Expected to Depart on the 20th with Evacuees

The U.S. government has advised its citizens in the Far East to evacuate and has dispatched special ships for transport. The first two ships, the "President McKinley" and the "President Pierce" of the [China] Mail Steamship Company, have already transported evacuees from Shanghai back to the U.S., as previously reported in this newspaper. According to an announcement yesterday by the United States Lines, the third special ship, the "Washington" postal ship, is expected to arrive in Shanghai at 3 PM today. Despite its large tonnage, it will enter the Huangpu River and is scheduled to dock at buoys 11 and 12. Crew members will disembark via small boats at the New Customs Wharf at 4:30 PM today. Approximately 900 people are planning to leave Shanghai on this ship. It will remain in Shanghai for three days and is scheduled to depart for the Philippines at 2 PM on the 20th. American evacuees in Shanghai are scheduled to board the ship in three groups on the morning of the 20th at 9 AM, 11 AM, and 12 PM via small boats departing from the New Customs Wharf. The United States Lines will remain open today to facilitate the exchange of formal tickets for the convenience of returning citizens.

American Women Reluctant to Part

Regarding the evacuation of a significant number of American citizens, according to a reporter's investigation, there are often conflicting opinions within families. Most men, for the sake of their wives' and children's safety, are willing to send their families back to the U.S. However, many women are unwilling to leave their husbands alone in China. Therefore, there is often reluctance to part. In addition, many women who have been in China for several years have just found a place to settle down. Once evacuated, they will lose all their jobs. Moreover, most of them do not know whether the government will fund their return to China after the situation calms down in the future.

Applications for Assistance Under Investigation

According to a staff member of the U.S. Consulate General, the applications for relief assistance from seven American citizens are still under investigation. Reportedly, two of them have been investigated and confirmed, and a total of five people, including their families, will be assisted by the government to return to the U.S. by ship next month or early next year. Another official from the consulate stated that they would process these applications as quickly as possible, but would not prioritize them over regular passengers.

Missionaries in a Dilemma Regarding Whether to Stay or Leave

Since the U.S. State Department in Washington issued a notice advising American citizens in the Far East to evacuate back to the U.S., American missionaries throughout China have been in a dilemma regarding this evacuation. The work of American missionaries in China is dedicated to lifelong service to the Christian faith. At the same time, they cannot turn a deaf ear to the U.S. government's advice. Therefore, the evacuation of American missionaries is not only a personal issue. If American missionaries evacuate in large numbers, the faith of many Christians in the East who believe in Jesus will inevitably be shaken. In addition, many Christians in the U.S. donate funds to enable missionaries to preach abroad. If the missionaries evacuate, it will certainly discourage donors. A certain church doctor has been unable to obtain the necessary medical supplies because he has to transport these supplies from the occupied areas to Free China. However, his profession is that of a church doctor; otherwise, he could evacuate back to the U.S.

Shipping Line Representatives Assisting with Evacuation

After American citizens in the Far East were ordered to evacuate, Royal Gordon, Hugh Robinson, and Wallen Well, representatives dispatched by the United States Lines to provide guidance in the Far East, departed from San Francisco on the 10th via Pan American Airways' "Honolulu Clipper" flying boat and arrived in Hong Kong to assist with the evacuation of American citizens in the Far East. Gordon also visited Admiral Hart, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Far East Fleet, at the Manila Hotel in Manila to discuss everything.

### Safety Week to Begin Tomorrow; The Entire City Should Pay Attention to Maintain Traffic Order

In view of the remarkable results achieved last year in promoting the "Safety First" campaign, the police authorities of the two foreign concessions in Shanghai, in order to further promote public awareness of traffic rules and reduce traffic accidents, have jointly launched the second "Safety First" campaign starting tomorrow. The various measures have been reported in previous newspapers. According to a person in charge of the Traffic Department, the number of deaths in traffic accidents has been greatly reduced since the implementation of the safety campaign last year. The results of this second campaign will certainly be better than before. However, as this concerns public welfare, it is hoped that the people of the city will not only assume the responsibility of promoting and publicizing the campaign during Safety Week, but also continue to pay attention to traffic rules and urge relatives and neighbors to act cautiously after the campaign. This will not only reduce the number of innocent deaths, but also improve social order.

### Another Japanese Soldier Shot Yesterday; Situation in Hongkou is Serious; Assailant Escaped into [the] Chinese Population; Japanese Blocked Traffic and Conducted a Major Search; Japanese Soldiers Shot at Chinese People in Two Locations Last Night and This Morning

Recently, several assassinations of Japanese officers have occurred in the Japanese-controlled area of Hongkou. By the day before yesterday, the number had reached more than ten. Unexpectedly, yesterday afternoon, another Japanese soldier was shot in the Hongkou area. He was hit by a bullet and seriously injured. At the time, a Japanese officer who witnessed the incident attempted to arrest the assailant, but the assailant fired another shot, preventing him from approaching. The assailant eventually escaped without a trace. After the incident, the Japanese side implemented strict security measures and conducted a large-scale search, causing great disturbance to residents. The details are as follows:

Japanese Sergeant Again Ambushed

Yesterday afternoon, at approximately 12:45 PM, a Japanese sergeant named Gon Tominaga was walking on Wusong Road in Hongkou. When he arrived in front of the Japanese Residents Association Club at No. 295 Peng Road, someone suddenly shot him in the back. Tominaga was hit by a bullet and immediately fell to the ground. Seeing that his goal had been achieved, the assailant turned into a small alley on Peng Road and escaped. At the time, an employee of a Japanese shop witnessed the incident and quickly ran into the alley to arrest him. However, after only a few steps, the assailant turned around and fired another shot. The employee was frightened and did not dare to approach, allowing the assailant to escape. He then sent the injured soldier to the nearby Shinozaki Hospital for treatment. When the assailant fired the shot in return, a Chinese person was grazed by a stray bullet and was also sent to the hospital for treatment.

Bridges Blockaded and Traffic Cut Off

After the incident, the Japanese immediately blockaded the Garden Bridge, Sichuan Road Bridge, and all roads west of North Jiangxi Road. They also conducted a door-to-door search in the area where the incident occurred. Marines and military police patrolled North Jiangxi Road, Tiantong Road, Qipu Road, Wenzaoshi Road, Haining Road, and Bazilu Road. Japanese Marines armed with guns were stationed at the corners. Traffic was also temporarily cut off at the North Railway Station on the boundary road. After hearing the news, the Public Concession Police also dispatched a large number of armed Chinese and Western detectives to the Garden Bridge, Sichuan Road Bridge, and Jiangxi Road Bridge to maintain order.

Many People Blocked and Unable to Pass

After the Japanese implemented security measures at 1:00 PM, traffic in the area was completely cut off. Even Japanese people who requested passage were not allowed. Those who went to the General Post Office to deliver letters were blocked from leaving. The staff of the General Post Office were also blocked. At one point, no fewer than 500 people were standing on the bridges. Chinese and Western children from schools within and outside the settlement were unable to return home and stood outside the barbed wire fence, not knowing whether to laugh or cry. Those who arrived in Shanghai on the Shanghai-Hangzhou train sat on the ground at the station. Those who wanted to go to the railway station to catch a train had to turn back with their luggage. It was not until around 6:00 PM that the Japanese opened a gap on Haining Road and North Jiangxi Road, allowing only residents to enter and exit. All vehicles were blocked, and inspections were extremely strict. The security measures were not completely lifted in the other areas even late into the night.

Garden Bridge Opened Late into the Evening

It was not until around 8:40 PM that the Garden Bridge was opened for traffic. Pedestrians and vehicles could travel freely on Broadway Road and Ward Road. However, the traffic was still blocked in the area around the Wusong Road Triangle Vegetable Market and Hubei Road. As a result, hundreds of men and women were stationed at the Zha Pu Road Bridge, all wanting to demand that the bridge be opened.

Japanese Soldiers Fired at Zha Pu Road Bridge

Japanese Marines stationed at the Zha Pu Road Bridge to maintain order fired several shots. A Chinese person was hit and fell to the ground, seriously injured. Later, the Japanese used a military vehicle to take him away, and his whereabouts are unknown. After hearing the news, the Central Fire Brigade quickly dispatched an ambulance, but it was stopped by the Japanese on Wusong Road and had to turn back. It is impossible to find out the casualties among the injured Chinese and where they were taken.

Worker Shot While Strolling Again

At approximately 0:30 AM this morning, Zhang Xiaodao (32 years old, from Tongzhou), a worker at the shooting range, was shot by Japanese soldiers while strolling under the Garden Bridge, hitting his left waist. He was seriously injured. An ambulance was called to the scene and took him to Tongren Hospital for treatment.

### Shanghai Money Guild Passes [Resolution] to Close on Saturday Afternoons

### Japanese Residents' Election Plan; Hopes of Success are Slim; Shanghai's Future Depends on U.S.-Japan Talks; Changing Election Laws is a Test

According to The China Press, yesterday (the 15th), a well-informed source claimed that the Shanghai Japanese Residents Association planned to change the election rules for the Shanghai Municipal Council before the next annual ratepayers' meeting to benefit the Japanese side. This attempt has no major implications and is unlikely to succeed because the real issues affecting Shanghai's future are currently being resolved through diplomatic channels between Washington and Tokyo.

Prepared But Still Concerned

It has been seven months since the heated Council election was held this April. The next election is still five months away. The Japanese are currently watching the diplomatic developments, and the British and American groups are also waiting to see what the Japanese will do before forming an election committee. The Japanese side may decide that using elections to implement a "blitzkrieg" in the Public Concession will provoke the United States, and the Japanese do not want U.S.-Japan relations to worsen.

Currently Silent on the Matter

If the Japanese have no extravagant hopes and are satisfied with the existing two seats held by Japanese councilors next April, then there is no need for an election at all. It is expected that both sides will remain silent on the election issue. Last year, leading British citizens began preparing for the election in June, ultimately achieving victory. This year, although the Japanese side vowed to immediately prepare for a comeback in the election next April after their defeat in the election, there has been little or no preparation by the Japanese and the British-American groups to date.

British Strength Sufficient for Victory

It is rumored that some Japanese merchants have purchased land and houses in the Public Concession to increase their electoral strength. However, the strength of the British group is strong enough to suppress this challenge. The rumored attempt by the Japanese Residents Association to change the election law can be seen as a Japanese test to see what they can achieve in this regard. This depends largely on the extent to which Tokyo can proceed with the "New Order" program.

### Shanghai Municipal Council to Continue Flat Price Rice Program with Strong Support; Rice Merchants Manipulating and Monopolizing Will Not Be Tolerated

At the board meeting held on Wednesday morning, the Shanghai Municipal Council passed a resolution to continue the Flat Price Rice program. It is understood that the Council’s subsidized rice will sell out by the 19th of this month. Preparations are currently underway with the rice merchants to continue the program. Although the specific measures are still under discussion, the Shanghai Municipal Council has resolved to support its continuation with cash subsidies. The authorities of both Concessions are also paying close attention to the overall food supply in Shanghai. Responsible senior personnel stated emphatically that both authorities will not easily let go of the rice merchants who are manipulating, monopolizing, and hoarding. Once an investigation proves it, they will be severely punished in accordance with the regulations. In addition to the weekly reporting and verification of the rice stocks in each rice shop by the Rice Evaluation Committee, the evaluation committees of both authorities will also send staff to conduct periodic investigations for reference.

### Various Public Organizations to Express Views on Telephone Price Increases; No Need for Price Increase at All; French Municipal Council Should Rectify

Since the authorities provisionally set three principles for telephone price increases, the entire city has been surprised, unanimously believing that Shanghai Telephone Company's business has flourished after the war, and there is absolutely no need for a price increase. Now they are attempting to implement a huge price increase. If this measure is actually implemented, the price increase will amount to no less than double, setting a record for price increases in other public utilities. It will significantly hinder industrial and commercial operations. Currently, all parties hope that the French Municipal Council can still rectify this unreasonable price increase. It is also heard that various public organizations within the concession are deeply concerned about this matter and will express strong views.

### U.S. Consulate Still Awaiting Reply Regarding Protest Against Seizure of Dasheng; Japanese Side Studying Content of Protest; Rumor that Italian Ship PaoloIne Blocked Outside Songmen Port

As of yesterday (the 16th), they were still awaiting a reply from the Japanese side. The Japanese Consulate General stated that they are still studying the U.S. protest and will promptly submit a written reply to U.S. officials.

The Italian Consulate stated that they have not received any news from the ship. Japanese naval officers declined to comment on the matter.

### Fourth Dharma Talk by the Five Religions Society; Expounding the Essentials of Diligence; Explaining According to Buddhist Scriptures in Four Sections

The Fourth Dharma Talk by the Five Religions Society was given by Pastor Xie Songsan on "The Similarities Between Christianity and Confucianism." His speech was featured in yesterday's newspaper. After Pastor Xie finished his speech, it was decided that Mr. Yang Zhongyi would speak on the fourth of the similar points between Confucianism and Buddhism, namely the fourth of the Six Paramitas (perfections): Virya Paramita. The name is translated from kun li ye po lo kun za mi in Sanskrit, Virya in Chinese is called diligence, which is an energetic practice without regression. That is, getting up at the crowing of the rooster, working diligently for good, and not resting day or night, diligently practicing without laziness. According to the Buddhist scriptures, it is explained in four sections:

Distinguishing Diligence and Laziness

The Bodhisattva's Conduct Sutra narrates the Buddha telling Ananda, "Laziness is the accumulation of all actions. Laziness at home leads to insufficient clothing and food, and the failure of industry. Laziness in monastic life makes it impossible to escape the suffering of birth and death. All things are achieved through diligence. Diligence at home leads to abundant clothing and food, and the expansion of industry. Diligence in monastic life leads to the completion of the path, until Buddhahood is attained. All are achieved through diligence." Diligence does not regress until Buddhahood is attained. This is diligent practice without fatigue. "Everyone can become a Yao or Shun." Alas, "skill comes from diligence and is wasted by play." Therefore, diligence and frugality build a family, and worry and toil build a nation. Pleasure and idleness are poison, and ease and extravagance destroy the body. "It is like building a mountain, not yet completed," stop I stop. "It is like leveling the ground, even covering a basket," progress I go. Such is the distinction between diligence and laziness.

The Principle of Diligence

Translated by the Jin Dynasty's Zhu Fahu, the Sutra of the Stages of Practice says, "The Buddha said, 'Seeing one's past lives, wandering back and forth in birth and death for countless kalpas, the accumulated bones exceed Mount Sumeru, the marrow smeared on the ground can cover the three thousand worlds, the blood shed is more than the rain that has fallen throughout ancient and modern times. Only by wanting to escape the suffering of birth and death, diligently day and night, seeking non-action.'" "The Master's nature and the Way of Heaven cannot be heard." The difficulty of hearing about the Great Overcoming is such. If there is hearing, "hearing the Way in the morning, one can die in the evening." The joy of hearing the Way is also such. Therefore, "upon hearing it, practice it." "Zilu, upon hearing something, was unable to practice it, fearing that he would hear something else." How can the Way be merely heard? The emphasis is on diligent practice, approaching benevolence. "The practice of benevolence comes from oneself." "If I desire benevolence, then benevolence arrives." Therefore, it is said, "Bearing a heavy burden and a long road, taking benevolence as one's own responsibility, is it not heavy? Ceasing only after death, is it not long?" Therefore, "the superior man does not depart from benevolence for the space of a single meal." If one's faith in the Way is not firm and one gives up halfway, Confucius rebukes them, saying, "Now you limit yourself." Therefore, one must be determined to love learning and uphold the Way unto death. Strive, strive, "Speak to him without laziness." Yan Yuan's "desire to stop is impossible," therefore "seeing his progress but not seeing his limit."

The Thought of Diligence

The Sutra of the Substantial Seed says, "Diligence has ten thoughts. The Bodhisattva, thinking of these ten thoughts, has three real merits and focuses on them without confusion. This is called Right Mindfulness Diligence." "Mad thoughts can overcome the sage." The impossibility of stopping thought is such. Therefore, it is said, "Think of this, think of this." "Keep it in your heart, how can you forget it?" Think of it, think of it, and think of it again. "If you think of it and cannot attain it, do not give up." It is not that ghosts and spirits communicate it. The bright virtue of our heart illuminates itself.

The Method of Diligence

The Tang Dynasty's Prajna-traya translated the Sutra of the Great Vehicle's Six Paramitas, saying, "There are four kinds of diligence, possessing complete wisdom. What are the four? First, diligence in much learning; second, diligence in upholding; third, diligence in joyful speaking; fourth, diligence in right practice." Diligence begins with much learning. "Learn much, choose the good and follow it, see much and recognize it." Hear much and speak carefully, see much and act carefully. "Then much learning is beneficial." Next, one must be able to uphold "with single-mindedness" and "unchanging until death." "Choose the mean and obtain one goodness, then hold it firmly and do not lose it." "Those who are seen to be consistent can be relied upon." Therefore, "the superior man follows the Way and acts." Confucius had the lament "I cannot stop," next one must be happy to speak. "Those who know it are not as good as those who love it, and those who love it are not as good as those who delight in it." King Wen's virtue is pure, "pure and unceasing." Confucius was benevolent and wise, both sage, never weary of doing it, never tired of teaching people. Finally, right practice, "those who are sincere choose goodness and hold fast to it," and should "practice it diligently. If you practice it and cannot attain it, do not give up. Not only do not give up, but if others can do it once, do it a hundred times; if others can do it ten times, do it a thousand times. The Doctrine of the Mean's "utmost sincerity is unceasing," The I Ching's "self-strengthening unceasing," The I Ching's "the movement of Heaven is strong," "the flow of passing water."

### London Residents Not Afraid of Air Raids

A prominent British citizen in Shanghai recently received a letter from London, stating that the Soviet military newspaper Red Star recently published an editorial stating that Germany's aerial offensive against Britain has clearly failed. Today, Britain's strength is not only sufficient to defend its homeland, but it is also carrying out effective air raids against Germany. London has suffered considerable losses from continuous attacks by German aircraft, but the air defense facilities there are thorough, and all industries and other activities continue without hindrance.

### Moufu Food Supplies Exhausted; Rumors of Seizure of Jiangding Along with the Merli

The Jardine Matheson Line’s Moufu, seized by a Japanese naval vessel off the Zhejiang coast earlier this month, has not yet been released. Passengers and crew remain held aboard. Yesterday, a telegram arrived in Shanghai from the ship reporting that, with the exception of the mail already retrieved, none of the remaining cargo could be moved. Currently, passengers and crew are suffering from hunger and cold due to the exhaustion of food supplies. In addition to requesting assistance from Zhoushan, the company authorities were urged to provide assistance urgently. After receiving the telegram, the shipping department of the Moufu dispatched personnel yesterday to Zhoushan on a Japanese ship with funds to provide assistance. At the same time, the German consulate was informed of the situation again to negotiate with the Japanese for their release, to ensure the safety of the passengers. As for the German merchant Rulun Yanghang’s Feikang and the American merchant Dasheng, they are still being held off the coast of Zhoushan. Each company has sent telegrams of inquiry, but all have been returned, and it is expected that the radio station is also being monitored by the Japanese, preventing any communication. It has also been heard that the Italian merchant Douli was also detained by a Japanese warship off Songmen, but the company has no confirmed information. It is rumored that the Jiangding and the Merli were seized at the same time.

### The Trend of US Embargo Against Japan

The United States has been patient with Japan for three years, and now it has taken an embargo action. This action is tantamount to a strong notification to the Japanese industrial community that, from now on, Japan will need to find other sources for 90% of its scrap steel and iron.

But this blow, though extremely fierce to Japanese industry, is not as indicated by the large-print headlines of some newspapers that the US supply of steel to Japan is completely cut off from now on. Outside the current embargo, some similar goods, such as alloys and semi-finished steel, continue to be supplied to Japan for large-scale consumption by its army. This pure steel, though smaller in quantity than the large amounts of scrap steel flowing into Japan, is simpler in procedure for the manufacture of munitions.

In the past year, Japan purchased $32,592,500 worth of steel scrap from the United States, accounting for 90% of its total steel imports. At the same time, Japan also purchased $5,958,739 worth of alloys from the United States, accounting for 98.51% of its total imports of this item, and $4,228,271 worth of semi-finished steel, accounting for 32.53% of its total imports of this item.

The value of steel scrap purchased by Japan from the United States last year was more than three times the total value of alloys and semi-finished steel. On the other hand, Japan was able to purchase from Europe for a long period last year, until the outbreak of the Second European War in early September, after which Japan's reliance on the United States to supply alloys and steel increased.

As for the 1938 trade, the value of refined steel supplied to Japan by the United States was $11,251,804. While the development of domestic industry in Japan was sufficient to reduce the country's imports of this steel from the United States in 1939, the continued import of metalworking machinery by Japan proves that Japan has not yet achieved self-sufficiency in this regard.

American economists are particularly interested in Japan's continued and constant imports of metalworking machinery from the United States, considering it a clear indication that Japan still needs to import large quantities of industrial machinery for the technological basis of modern industry and military power.

According to experts, this is the weakness of Japanese industry. If the supply of all machinery and production tools to Japan were stopped, it would be detrimental to Japan, whether it continued its war against China or manufactured goods for export in order to earn foreign exchange. If an embargo on this machinery were implemented, its impact on the Japanese economy would certainly be greater than that of an embargo on steel scrap and gasoline.

The United States is stepping up industrial mobilization to replenish its own military equipment and to assist Britain. Under these circumstances, many US officials believe that the complete cessation of exports of factory machinery and production tools by the United States, except to the Western Hemisphere and Britain, will sooner or later be realized. According to a recent report from the US Department of Commerce, US exports of machinery to Britain increased by 60% in the first eight months of this year, which already proves that these exports have shifted from Japan to other countries.

Further embargoes against Japan would necessarily include automobiles and trucks, which accounted for more than 76% of the quantity supplied by the United States to Japan last year. Some American automobile manufacturers have already freed up some of their machinery to manufacture aircraft engines and tanks, two military equipment needs that Britain is very keen on, and Japan will be unable to purchase American vehicles even without the opposition of the US State Department.

Therefore, apart from the initial moral ban on the export of aircraft and the subsequent embargo on the export of gasoline used for aircraft, the United States has taken a further step in prohibiting the export of military supplies to Japan. The embargo on steel scrap is extremely important, but the export of alloys and semi-finished steel has not yet been blocked. The result of the tripartite alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan may completely close this door. (Translated from a Washington dispatch from the Christian Science Monitor)

### Gandhi, Old But Strong

— EL

Gandhi, as a 70-year-old elder, is still the most active leader in India in this era of great change, with the flames of war raging in Europe and crises lurking in India. Because of his age, this elder's personal life and all his actions cannot but be subject to the dictates of nature. The wrinkles on his face have increased more than before, and his sleep time is longer than in the past. He has also eliminated hard-shelled fruits and other things that are not easy to chew. What is surprising is that his habit of getting up early remains the same as before. He gets up at four o'clock every morning to participate in group prayers without fail. In fact, his most precious thinking and writing work of the day is done in these two hours of the morning. After the prayer, he goes back to sleep until he wakes up at dawn. He gets up to eat a simple breakfast, such as sheep's milk and fruit, and then walks a mile as a form of exercise.

Gandhi likes massages and enjoys sunbathing in winter. His skin is exceptionally smooth and clean, which is always surprising to visitors. In fact, every morning, he spends more than an hour slowly massaging tea oil, which makes it easy for him to get a good night's sleep.

His daily work has a fixed routine, with no room for any disruption. He has a meal at 11:00 AM, eating some sheep's milk, fruit, raw or steamed vegetables, and crispy homemade yellow bread. At noon, especially in summer, he always rests for one or two hours. At this time, his secretaries sort and file all incoming and outgoing correspondence. Items requiring his personal review and reply are placed on his desk.

From the afternoon until five o'clock, he receives guests or discusses important matters. Before the sun sets, he has dinner. The food is similar to the morning, but the portion is smaller. After dinner, he writes letters or selects articles for newspapers until 7:00 PM when he begins his evening prayers. Then, just like in the morning, he takes a walk for about half an hour and goes to bed at nine o'clock.

He lives in "Sevagram" - meaning "Village of Service" - to handle all official business. He is surrounded by many of his disciples, but political figures are rarely seen. He is interested not in politics but in the people's livelihood issues, such as how to develop the countryside, abolish class divisions, promote a new rural education system, and improve the food of the poor. He has to carefully study and review all these things, which takes more effort than politics.

Gandhi's concern is of course the freedom of India, but his approach is not like the single political approach of the Indian National Congress. He is passionate about two principles: non-violence and truth-telling. Gandhi hates violent aggression the most. Since the war began last year, he has been tormented by his worries. Moreover, in the last two years, influential members of the Indian National Congress have expressed opposition to Gandhi's doctrine and want to take opposing actions. But Gandhi has great perseverance and outstanding insight. Since last September, he has been acting according to what he advocates. Knowing that Hitler's aggression will endanger world stability and human civilization, he has expressed unconditional support for Britain and France. As for India's achievement of liberation and reconstruction, he believes that it is only a matter of time. However, after meeting with the Governor-General of India, Lord Linlithgow, he said: "If Britain and France are defeated, or Germany is destroyed, what will be the value of India's hoped-for liberation?"

In the past few months, Gandhi could have caused India to take disobedient and rebellious actions, and given the British great pain. However, the reason why Gandhi's plan does not go beyond this is not because the difference between riots and acts of disobedience is very small. What he values is that he does not want to take advantage of the British when they are struggling for their life and death and give them undue difficulty. Gandhi would rather wait until the end of the war before making India's demands, rather than using the British's crisis as India's opportunity.

Gandhi is broad-minded and is not bothered by all the disturbances. Under the surging public sentiment, he can remain indifferent and unwavering. He can still respond with jokes and smiles without being troubled by harsh accusations and criticisms from others. Gandhi can skillfully resolve all external difficulties and troubles, which is due to his religious cultivation.

Can Gandhi, with his waning years, witness the liberation of his motherland and achieve his lifelong wish? On this point, he once said: "If India can gain freedom in my lifetime, and I still have the energy, then I will still do my best as a civilian, and together shoulder the important task of national construction under the principle of non-violence." Gandhi's wishes were slightly hinted at in July of last year. At that time, the leaders of the National Congress unanimously resolved that, under the principle of non-violence, if India is not armed to resist foreign aggression, then Gandhi's views may not be completed.

The personal feelings of the leaders of the National Congress and Gandhi can be described as integrated and very close, but the age difference between the two sides is between twenty years, and there are inevitably differences in political views. The National Congress advocated declaring independence from Britain and establishing a wartime national government in Delhi. If Britain could accept this proposal, the Indian National Congress could wholeheartedly support Britain's war. However, the British side has not yet generously accepted.

### Child Pedestrian Safety Education

— Ying Dai

The Shanghai Municipal Council originally scheduled the Road Safety Campaign for mid-June, but it has been postponed to run from the 18th to the 24th of this month, lasting for a week. We know that in road accident cases, the number of people injured or killed is high among children, and this is true not only in China but also in various overseas countries. Therefore, we feel that promoting safety education for child pedestrians is a worthwhile issue to discuss. To ensure that this issue yields practical results, I believe several aspects should be emphasized simultaneously.

Schools: Currently, most schools, especially elementary schools, do not have a set curriculum for implementing safety education, but we cannot overlook the importance of this issue. European and American countries currently place great emphasis on safety education, particularly pedestrian safety education. Although we lack the tools and facilities for safety education, school authorities and teachers should always pay attention and take on the mission of promoting pedestrian safety education to reduce the number of children who die needlessly. Use films or verbal instruction to impart common knowledge about pedestrian safety, such as recognizing traffic lights, police hand signals, and driver hand signals, as well as being aware of places that require special attention when walking.

Parents: As everyone knows, the responsibility of training and educating children falls on teachers at school and on parents at home. Therefore, safety education is extremely important. In particular, road pedestrian safety occupies an even more important position in safety education. Parents should also convey all aspects of road safety and various common-sense facts to their children, telling them how to be safe when walking and what is dangerous. If pedestrian safety education for children is taken care of by both schools and families, the benefits will naturally be multiplied.

Children: It is not enough for just families and schools to pay attention to child pedestrian safety education. The most important point is that children themselves can implement it. They should be able to understand the traffic rules set by the authorities in the city, be especially careful when crossing the road, walk on the left side, understand the meaning of traffic lights, and remember the gestures of drivers. When walking, they should be cautious and not let their attention be diverted to other things. If these two aspects can work together, the safety of children's walking will naturally be greatly improved!

### Shirley Temple's Autobiography (22)

— Min

But learning the lessons in the film "Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm" was not an easy task. When I was working on that film, I first had to learn how to do that jump rope tap dance. This dance requires jumping rope while tap dancing. I knew that many children and their friends often played jump rope on the sidewalks. However, I didn't know how to jump rope, so I had to go to the gym with Jack Donohue. He taught me how to dance, gave me a rope, and showed me how to jump from beginning to end. Imagine, a big man teaching a little girl how to jump rope, isn't that a lot of fun?

Now I can jump rope, and it's a great game. In the beginning, it was hard work because my legs felt sore after the first lesson. I can jump rope and do tap dance steps at the same time. I carry the rope everywhere and jump everywhere. I jump in the bungalow, in the hallway at home, and even on the set at the studio with my stand-in. Now I treat it as a form of exercise.

People are not very close to me because I go back to my bungalow after each job, and they don't have a chance to approach me. Mr. Sheehan didn't want too many people to approach me, and he didn't want me to appear in various towns because he said that crowds and noise were not suitable for little girls. I didn't care about this, and neither did Mom and Dad, because all three of us like quiet and don't like excitement.

Of the many interesting experiences I've had, one that I find very memorable is playing with mud pies with two black girls, Ann and Nancy, when we were making the film "The Little Colonel." We didn't make these mud pies for the film, but just for ourselves. Also, when I worked with Jane Withers in "Bright Eyes," I had a chance to have fun and be happy. At that time, Jane was about ten or eleven years old, and her attitude towards me seemed not very good during work. When it was time for a break, she realized it herself, immediately ran up to me, put her arms around my neck, and said earnestly, "Shirley, I'm very sorry for treating you like that just now!" I said it didn't matter and didn't need to be taken to heart. So we both went hand in hand to the garden, where there was a doll carriage that Jane pushed in the film. At first, the prop manager refused to let us play with the carriage, but after we begged and pleaded, he finally agreed. Then Jane let me push her around the garden, with Jane putting one hand on the handle, walking with me. Oh, we became good friends!

### Black and White

— Jin Zhen

The early winter weather is getting colder day by day. Ah Ming saw that his own clothes changed from a thin white summer shirt to a lined jacket, and then another layer was added. Especially in recent days, the weather has been particularly cold, and his mother put a thick dark black woolen shirt on him. So, his body looked much fatter on the outside. With the addition of these several layers of clothes, he was, of course, much warmer. However, during the moment of changing clothes in the morning and evening, he felt especially cold. Strange! Wearing a single shirt in the summer still felt hot, but now, wearing so many clothes, the cold wind on the way to school still felt piercing. For some reason, Ah Ming asked his brother, "Why are summer clothes mostly white, and winter clothes are mostly black? Can't I wear white clothes in the winter?"

"You ask a good question. You should know that our body temperature is around 37 degrees Celsius. If the air temperature is not much different from the body temperature, the body feels very comfortable; otherwise, it feels either hot or cold. The purpose of wearing clothes is to prevent the already warmed air around the body from escaping in cold weather, and to allow body heat to dissipate in hot weather. Therefore, the climate changes differently in different seasons, and various materials are used to make clothes. In summer, most of the clothes worn are made of linen because linen is the easiest to transmit body heat. Moreover, in summer, we sweat the most, and if the sweat does not evaporate, the whole body feels uncomfortable. Therefore, we wear very thin and white clothes with coarse weaves, which allow air to go straight in and out, unobstructed, so that the hot air around the body does not stagnate. White cloth is used to prevent the sun's heat from being completely absorbed, and most of it is reflected, which is a unique property of white, and it also looks much cooler in the eyes. In winter, the outside temperature is very low, and our body temperature easily dissipates, which makes us feel cold. So, we have to wear several layers of clothes to feel warm. This not only increases the thickness of the clothes but also increases the air contained within them because air does not conduct heat. If the outermost layer of clothing is made so that it does not let air through at all, it will be very warm. Silk and cotton clothes are the warmest because they are very loose and contain the most air. For fur clothes, we should wear the fur side inside to be very warm, but many fashionable women expose the fur on the outside, which is not warm at all except for looking good, which makes no sense. Dark black colors have the property of absorbing all the sun's heat, so black clothes feel very warm. In winter, it is not impossible to wear white, but it will be cold on your own body and has nothing to do with others!"

### Elementary School Student Summer Homework Competition – Third Place, Advanced Level – A Meaningful Thing During Summer Vacation

— Denian Elementary School, Tang Yu You

Since the start of the "August 13th" battle, prices have risen day by day, and life has become more and more difficult. Many compatriots, under the high pressure of the whip of life, work hard for survival and cannot get enough to eat all day long. Most of them have no time to take care of their children's education problems, so after the war, many children who have no school to attend and can only wander around have been added to the alleys of Shanghai. They wander around all day and are not educated, so they naturally fall into the lower class.

Our school is also in an alley, and it is no exception. There is also a group of wild children who often bully the general elementary school students at the front and back doors of our school. They snatch the toys of elementary school students; throw the hats of elementary school students; beat and scold elementary school students; and squeeze and bump into female students. They can do all kinds of evil deeds.

When classes are in session at school, they write words that insult the principals or classmates of the school on the walls outside the door with white chalk, or knock on the door a few times outside the door as if someone is knocking on the door. When you open the door and look, there is not even a shadow of anyone. It is really annoying.

The teachers' investigation revealed that the leader of this group of wild children is named Shi Gen. He has also studied for five years, but now he has no money, so he has dropped out of school.

During the summer vacation, the school made a ping-pong table for us to play games. When Shi Gen saw it, he was very interested! He asked the teacher to allow him to join in the game and guaranteed that he would never cause trouble again. The teacher wanted to turn him into a good child, so he agreed to his request. On the one hand, he could have a proper game to play and no longer cause trouble, and on the other hand, he could gradually influence him at any time to make him change his ways and become a good person. For more than a month, he has indeed changed from bad to good and is very polite. He does not make any noise in the school, and he is no longer lawless to other children in the alley.

### Newspaper Reading Handbook

— Mu Sheng

Little friends! You can always see the "Children's Weekly" specially set up for you in this newspaper every Sunday morning, right! Although it only publishes five or six articles in each issue, it contains a lot of knowledge! Look! It has articles that belong to common sense, articles that belong to conversation, articles that belong to science, and articles that belong to...Little friends! It is indeed your "Knowledge Compendium".

But, little friends! After you read this "Knowledge Compendium" every time, you will probably forget what is said in each article and your own insights after a few weeks or months, isn't that a pity? Never mind! There is a way, which is to make a "Newspaper Reading Handbook" for each person.

The materials and methods for the "Newspaper Reading Handbook" are very simple. I will now briefly write it down below:

Materials: Just prepare a useless notebook (such as a telephone book, etc.), some paste, and a pair of scissors.

Method: Cut out the articles published in each issue carefully with scissors, and then paste them on the notebook in different categories with paste. If you have any feelings or insights of your own, you may also record them and transcribe them after the article.

This is how a "Newspaper Reading Handbook" is made.

### Snippets

Playing games with two people is more interesting than playing games alone; reading is also the same, it is easier to make progress when two people study each other than when one person studies alone.

Children of the modern age must have modern common sense, the era of relying only on what is read in some textbooks is over.

"Learning" should be done by both "learning" and "asking". "Learning without asking" is rote learning, and "asking without learning" is empty learning. Little friends, remember! Remember!

### Film Industry Brewing a Lawsuit

— Yin Yi

Guohua to Sue Yuan Meiyun for Breach of Contract; Yuan Retains Chen Tingrui as Lawyer for Defense

A lawsuit is about to erupt in the film industry recently and is currently in the works. It would be an unfortunate event if it cannot be resolved.

The instigator of the lawsuit is Liu Zhonghao, owner of Guohua Film Company, and the target of the lawsuit is Yuan Meiyun.

The internal situation of this incident is as follows:

Around December of last year, Guohua planned to produce "Glamorous Romance" (華麗緣), with the main character belonging to Yuan Meiyun. Yuan Meiyun was a basic actor for China United Film Company (中國聯合影業公司). Guohua attempted to invite her as a guest star. Initially, Zhou Xuan (周璇) and Yuan Yanyun (袁延雲) were sent to persuade her. Zhou Xuan was Liu Zhonghao's adopted daughter, and she and Yuan Meiyun were colleagues at Yihua Film Company (藝華公司) in the past and had always had a good relationship. Before Yuan Meiyun, Zhou Xuan did not make any blatant gestures, but encouraged Yuan Meiyun to guest star in one or two films for Guohua. The meaning was that if Yuan Meiyun agreed, she could act as an intermediary. However, Yuan Meiyun rejected her kindness at that time. Later, Liu Zhonghao personally visited Yuan Meiyun and made a request to guest star in a film. Yuan Meiyun declined politely based on two reasons: first, she had a contract with China United, and second, her husband, Wang Yin (王引), was in Hong Kong, and she could not make a decision on her own. Later, Liu Zhonghao visited Yuan Meiyun three times in quick succession. The last time, he brought 2,000 yuan in cash. His wording was very euphemistic, saying that if China United's General Manager Zhang Shankun (張善琨) did not allow her to guest star in a film for Guohua, or if Wang Yin came back and objected, it would not hurt to call it off and return the money. He solemnly stated that as long as Yuan Meiyun accepted the money, filming could be done at any time and did not have to be done immediately. At that time, Yuan Meiyun, unable to refuse the hospitality, made two points to Liu Zhonghao: (1) If the China United leadership did not approve, the money would be returned, and the original agreement would be cancelled. (2) The remuneration for each film would be at least 5,000 yuan.

As a result of the consultation, Liu Zhonghao said that the first point was absolutely no problem since he had proposed it. He asked to reduce the remuneration to 3,000 yuan. Yuan Meiyun believed that this matter might not be approved by China United, and since Liu Zhonghao had made an oral guarantee that it would be called off if it was not approved, she agreed. At the moment, she signed a receipt stating that three films would be filmed, with a remuneration of 9,000 yuan, and 1,000 yuan would be paid in advance as a deposit.

After Yuan Meiyun signed the receipt and received the deposit, Liu Zhonghao stated to Yuan Meiyun that one of the three films was "Glamorous Romance" (華麗緣), which was planned to be divided into two parts. Yuan Meiyun immediately stated that this was not possible because it would be equivalent to filming four films. Liu Zhonghao agreed to discuss it later.

Afterwards, Wang Yin in Hong Kong learned of this matter and strongly disagreed. He wrote a quick letter to Yuan Meiyun, preventing her from accepting Guohua's invitation. Yuan Meiyun deposited the 2,000 yuan deposit into the Jiading Commercial Savings Bank (嘉定商業儲蓄銀行). On the one hand, she reported the matter to Zhang Shankun and asked him to mediate. After Wang Yin returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong, he asked Fan Liangbo (樊良伯), the general manager of Jiading Bank (who had not yet passed away at the time), to mediate, willing to return the deposit in accordance with Liu Zhonghao's original promise and call it off. However, Guohua did not agree and urged Yuan Meiyun to carry out the previous agreement.

The matter was almost at a stalemate. Guohua insisted that Yuan Meiyun fulfill the agreement based on that receipt, while Yuan Meiyun resolutely refused. This matter has been delayed until recently, when Guohua brought up the old matter again and issued a filming notice to Yuan Meiyun, which Yuan Meiyun naturally did not accept. Therefore, it is rumored that Guohua will file a lawsuit against Yuan Yanyun for breach of contract and demand compensation for losses.

Now, Yuan Meiyun is also planning countermeasures. She has retained lawyer Chen Tingrui (陳霆銳) as her legal advisor and will ask Chen to appear in court to defend her if a lawsuit is filed.

It is expected that the development of this matter will attract great attention in the film industry.

### Wang Huaying's Magic

Qingxin Middle School (淸心中學) held its 80th-anniversary celebration at the Ningbo Native Place Association (寧波同鄕會) starting on the 13th, and various performances such as plays, music, comedy, and martial arts were held for three consecutive days until yesterday, and the situation was very enthusiastic. Among them was Wang Huaying's (王化影) magic, which was rare, such as women appearing in empty boxes and small flags turning into large flags, all of which were very interesting. Especially the last section of horizontally laying a woman in the air was even more amazing; first, a woman standing up was hypnotized by Wang Huaying, and the woman stood upright. Then, two assistants lay her horizontally in the air. There were no hanging ropes above, and there were no supports below. Then, an iron ring was used to cover her from head to toe to indicate that there were no hanging objects in the air and no shelves on the ground. It is said that this kind of magic comes from India, and it is rare to see it in Shanghai.

Hawthorne's Cases

### The Homecoming of the Dance Queen

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter 11: Zhao Boxiong's Confession

Hawthorne looked up at him and asked, "When you fired the gun, you clearly believed that she was still alive, right?"

Zhao Boxiong looked a little uneasy. The tip of his tongue was exposed outside his lips again. He said uncomfortably, "Yes, this was my recklessness, but it was actually because I was overly excited. But I immediately felt this mistake when I got back in the car. Because not only did she not shout after being shot, I seemed to remember that there was no movement at all. I suspected that she may have already been murdered before I shot her, and I only shot a dead person!"

A smile suddenly appeared on the corner of Hawthorne's lips, but the smile disappeared in an instant. He said coldly, "Your mistake was discovered very quickly, and you also have a very high estimate of your own shooting skills."

Zhao Boxiong's eyes widened again. "Mr. Hawthorne, please allow me to say something presumptuous. My handgun shooting, within ten yards, can achieve a score of 99 percent."

When he said this, his expression and tone both had a smug expression. I secretly thought that he was exaggerating, fortunately, he still left one point. The bullet on the wooden wall of the telephone room of the Yadon Hotel was probably the one point that was missing his perfection.

He added, "Actually, even if my handgun hadn't hit, she should have shouted and stood up if she was a living person. It was very natural for me to realize my mistake."

"After I returned to the hotel, my only plan was that if this matter was revealed, I could not be involved in it for the sake of my mission. Therefore, I temporarily changed a room. This morning, I disguised myself and went around the seventh floor again to see if anyone suspected me. I happened to see two gentlemen investigating Agen at Room 71. I was a little scared because I knew that this matter had gone through Mr. Hawthorne's hands, and he had already noticed me. The danger of my being involved was simply unavoidable." He suddenly frowned, clasped his hands together, expressing a deep sense of regret. He continued: "Mr. Hawthorne, when I think back now, I was really too stupid at that time. I didn't think of explaining the whole story to you frankly, but I was confused for a while and adopted that clumsy way of warning. Mr. Hawthorne, I am very sorry for this." (168)
