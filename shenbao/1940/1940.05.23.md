### The Battle of Yubei, Henan Province, Unfolds: Chinese Troops Complete Counter-Encircling Maneuver; Japanese Counterattacking Forces Southeast of Zaoyang Repeatedly Suffer Setbacks; Chinese Forces Advancing on Xianghua, Beijing-Zhongxiang Routes Make Excellent Progress

Guanghua: Since the 19th, Chinese forces in southern Henan and northern Hubei have once again implemented a thorough plan to annihilate the Japanese with extremely agile maneuvers. On one hand, they are doing their utmost to contain the Japanese forces in the area, preventing them from escaping, and after thoroughly allowing them to launch their inevitable counterattacks, they are gradually attracting them northward, guiding them directly into the trap pre-set by the Chinese. By the 21st, it was clear that the stubborn Japanese were gradually stepping into the edge of the area expected by the Chinese. The main force of the Chinese army on the front has already moved out to the flanks of the Japanese, with the Chinese forces advancing from the sides and closely pursuing the Japanese rear, completing a stronger large-scale counter-encirclement of the Japanese, jointly advancing towards the goal of annihilating the remaining Japanese in one fell swoop.

Nanyang: On the 21st, the Chinese army discovered that the remaining Japanese had entered the area initially designated by the Chinese for annihilating the Japanese. All the heroic warriors were exceptionally excited. According to the plan, which had not yet been fully completed at this point, they immediately implemented a very strong counter-encirclement of the Japanese. Currently, the deployment is gradually being completed, and the encirclement is being tightened from all sides, exerting its power to collectively annihilate the remaining Japanese.

Xiangyang: Since May 1st, the remaining Japanese, who had been continuously defeated by the Chinese forces on the border of Henan and Hubei, joined forces on the 19th with more than 10,000 Japanese reinforcements from the south. In the area southeast of Zaoyang, they launched a counterattack on the Chinese forces in multiple routes, relying on the remaining 200-plus vehicles and the cover of a large number of aircraft. The offensive was quite fierce. The Chinese army once again launched a large-scale mobile war. Since the 20th, in the areas on both sides of the Tang River and Bai River, they have inflicted blows on the Japanese at every turn. The Japanese forces have suffered repeated setbacks and heavy casualties. At noon on the 21st, the Chinese army gradually completed a new deployment and began to encircle and attack the Japanese forces in the area expected by the Chinese. The various armies repeatedly attacking the southern sections of the Xianghua Road and Beijing-Zhongxiang Road have now established contact with the newly added Chinese forces, cutting off the Japanese rear lines of communication while vigorously developing towards the southeast. Within days, they will be able to join forces with the victorious Chinese army from southern Henan to move south and attack the Japanese. The great battle is actively unfolding in the Jianghan exchange zone. (Dispatch of the 22nd)

One part engaged in another bloody battle with the Chinese forces on the outskirts of Xiangyang and attempted to stealthily cross the Bai River to harass the northwest. The Chinese are intercepting and attacking them in separate routes. Another group of Japanese troops attempted to take Shuanggou as a gathering point to cross the Xiang River, participating with more than 200 tanks and 50-plus aircraft. After the Chinese forces met them head-on with a severe blow, the Japanese forces suffered a major setback and have fallen into a dilemma where they cannot advance or retreat. (Dispatch of the 21st)

### Weng Wenhao Admonishes Subordinates

Chongqing: On the 21st, Minister Weng of the Ministry of Economic Affairs issued an order to all economic enterprise management agencies under his jurisdiction, advising staff to maintain integrity and pursue fairness in handling affairs. The order stated that the government manages various economic enterprises selectively to ensure that supply and demand are balanced and prices are stable. When things are necessary, they should be handled conscientiously. However, since the staff has more contact with various enterprises, they must maintain integrity and pursue fairness in handling affairs. They must not seek private gain or favor relatives and friends, causing adverse effects on the people. The Ministry has always been extremely hateful of corrupt personnel.

Chongqing: The Sichuan Provincial Government is now organizing a price stabilization office with a capital of 20 million yuan, half of which is contributed by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and half by the Provincial Treasury, and will be operating in Chengdu. Sichuan's prices are "high, and the people are very troubled, especially with rice. Recently, the government used 150 handcarts to transport 40,000 dan of rice to Chengdu to be sold at a fair price to benefit the poor. Other daily necessities such as cloth, fuel, and salt will also have their prices suppressed. It is said that there is no shortage of daily necessities in Sichuan. Taking rice as an example, the average annual surplus reaches as much as 10 million dan. The current high price of rice must be due to hoarding and manipulation by someone. Last year, the production of various goods in Sichuan was greatly expanded. According to figures released today, Chongqing currently weaves 60,000 bolts of cloth, 10,000 dozen socks, and produces 4,000 bales of cotton yarn and 80,000 bags of flour each month.

Editorial

### Can Japan Emulate Germany?

It has been several decades since the Meiji Restoration in Japan. It is a historical miracle that a small island nation has suddenly joined the ranks of the world's leading powers. However, this achievement lacks a deep historical foundation and has not undergone thorough reforms. Although it may appear glorious and brilliant on the surface, it contains countless contradictions and flaws. Among them, what is particularly noteworthy is the cultural and academic aspect: everything old was copied from China, and the new learning has been closely following the West; apart from imitation and elaboration, there is almost no creation to speak of, and thus it cannot develop into an independent cultural system. This is a serious issue concerning the fundamental basis of Japan's founding, and cannot be concealed by temporary prosperity and power.

The above situation can be found in countless examples in the Japanese military aggression against China. It is said that the Japanese army recently used a large number of tanks, armored vehicles, aircraft, and other weapons to launch a fierce offensive in the battle on the border of Henan and Hubei, intending to imitate the German "Blitzkrieg" strategy used in the Western European war. As for the ultimate goal of the German army's strategy, whether it is gain or loss cannot be determined today; but from the perspective of the strategy and tactics themselves, it is indeed a major change in military technology, worthy of military talents all over the world to lower their heads and learn from, and to re-examine those corrupt and old tactical theories. The sudden imitation by the Japanese military authorities seems not to be at the forefront of the trend. Make plans for the ultimate change; but is this kind of imitation likely to succeed?

The so-called Blitzkrieg tactics are nothing more than gathering a large number of mechanized troops and sharp weapons, and taking advantage of the enemy's unpreparedness to launch a rapid and fierce attack. This kind of application must consume multiples of the equipment and lives compared to ordinary military attacks; therefore, the reserves and replenishment of military weapons and ammunition must be abundant and rapid, and the morale of the troops must be courageous and developed in order to achieve the effect of overwhelming superiority. The occasions for its application must also be conducive to a quick and decisive battle, preparing to complete a specific goal in the shortest period of time. Germany's recent repeated successes in this strategy are due to the high degree of development of its heavy industry, and the large-scale production and supply of military equipment; the reason for its decision is that under the strict control and theoretical hypnosis of the Nazis, the people have long possessed the conditions of war machines; The aspirations of the German nation, the insults of the Treaty of Versailles. All see this war as a way to vent; Secondly, there are simple and clear operational goals, such as the Polish, Danish, Norwegian, Belgian, Dutch and French invasions, so they can harvest the expected results for a while. If the war is prolonged thereafter, the front line is in stalemate, and the hostile situation gradually becomes complex from simple, then its effectiveness must be gradually weakened. People are only shocked by the brilliant record of Blitzkrieg tactics, but do not pursue the conditions for its success, which is a mistake.

At present, all the situations of the Japanese army are exactly the opposite of those of the German army. The morale has already declined, and the national strength is almost exhausted. Although sharp weapons are the only reliance for the Japanese to win, the number is absolutely insufficient to compare with Germany, and it cannot withstand the consumption of large halos. Trying Blitzkrieg tactics in this way only shows that they do not know their own strength and speed up their own failure. The course of the recent Henan-Hubei campaign has provided a clear example. Especially since the Sino-Japanese War has developed into a plane war at this stage. Mobile warfare, protracted warfare, are absolutely not suitable for the application of Blitzkrieg tactics, and there is no target that can be regarded by the Japanese army as a kind of heart to attack. Taking a step back, even if the Japanese army in northern Hubei luckily succeeds this time, at best it will only expand the periphery of the Wuhan stronghold, which has nothing to do with the victory or defeat of the overall war. What's more, the parachute troops and fifth columns used in the German Blitzkrieg strategy are completely lacking on the Japanese side; there is no training for parachute troops in Japan at all, and with the current war-weariness of Japanese soldiers and civilians, the application of this tactic is almost impossible; as for the Japanese fifth column, they can only parasitize in the occupied areas, and act in an authoritarian manner, but they have no effect on the rear of China. Looking at the course of the Sino-Japanese War, only the Battle of Shanghai and Nanjing was more suitable for the application of Blitzkrieg tactics; however, the Japanese staff talents at that time not only failed to invent before Germany, but their troops were gradually supplemented from the initial 10,000 or 20,000 people to the final 200,000 people, which is exactly the opposite of the use of Blitzkrieg tactics. Within the area of Shanghai and Nanjing, which is hundreds of miles, the confrontation lasted for three months, which laid the initial foundation for the victory of the Chinese War of Resistance, while the Japanese army lost the opportunity for a quick victory, and even if they imitated the German strategy vividly afterwards, they would have nothing to show off.

The imitation of Germany by Japanese strategy and tactics has not only been from today. The experiences of the Prussian-Austrian and Prussian-French wars have always been regarded as a model for combat theory in Japan. Since Tai Shan Yan brought the "Sedan" strategy back to the East from Germany, Yamagata Aritomo personally directed an encirclement and annihilation tactic in the Battle of Pyongyang and achieved success. "Sedan" and the "Tannenberg" that followed became the strategic models in the minds of Japanese soldiers. However, only imitating and failing to adapt to the environment to change has caused these military entourages to suffer serious blows; in the three-year Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese army has always had "Sedan" and "Tannenberg" in mind twice, but has never succeeded, and instead has repeatedly formed the object of being surrounded and annihilated; the reasons are of course multifaceted, and there is no doubt that their only knowing how to imitate is the main weakness.

If they are smart, seeing the recent achievements of the German military, the heads of Kasumigaseki should turn back! Learning to walk in Handan and failing to draw a tiger will not only cause ridicule, but the result will only be a more miserable failure. There is no shortage of enlightened people on the Japanese side who should be able to recognize the serious problems of Japan itself from this lesson; unfortunately, reason in Japan has not yet reached the point where it can raise its head.

### German Troops Advance Towards the English Channel, Attempting to Encircle Allied Forces; French Counterattack Recaptures Arras Yesterday; Bridges over the Somme River Destroyed, German Offensive Obstructed

Paris: Military sources here recently stated that although no major changes occurred in the situation on the front last night, Arras has been recaptured by our army. The situation of the battles on each route is summarized as follows: (1) The situation on the north bank of the Somme River is quite chaotic due to the infiltration of small, agile German units into the Picardy region. (2) On the Belgian side, the Allied forces are engaged in fierce battles with the German army in the Scheldt River area, which have not stopped so far. (3) Both sides are fighting day and night in the Cambrai area, with mutual victories and losses, but the city of Arras has been recovered. (4) The line from the Aisne River to the southwest of Sedan and the entire Maginot Line are as solid as gold. The enemy army must not cross the line. (5) The German troops who have infiltrated Picardy are only small, agile units. Their vanguard has already arrived near Amiens, and another small unit is attacking the Abbeville railway station. All bridges on the Somme River have been destroyed by the French army, and it will be difficult for the German army to cross them. The situation on the Aisne River is also the same. In addition, the German army has not taken any action in the Rethel region. The garrison of the French Montmédy fortress continues to resist vigorously, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy, and the enemy's offensive has been frustrated. (Havas dispatch of the 22nd)

Paris: The Ministry of the Army recently issued a communiqué declaring that the French army has recovered Arras, a militarily important location that the Germans could use to attack Abbeville. (United Press dispatch of the 22nd)

Berlin: Responsible German military officials declared that after Germany advanced from Amiens to Abbeville, it has completed the encirclement of the Allied forces on the Franco-Belgian border. German mechanized units and infantry are advancing steadily. The Belgian troops on the eastern flank are still fighting valiantly, but the British troops have retreated to the English Channel, wantonly destroying all areas they pass through. The French Ninth Army is in danger of being annihilated. General Giraud, the commander of the army, has been captured by the German army. (Haitong dispatch of the 22nd)

Berlin: The German side here declared last night that the German troops who reached the English Channel yesterday were not only advance units, but the total number of troops was about 60,000 or more, and there are many more powerful troops coming later. The German army spared no sacrifices. Yesterday, it swept through 60 miles along the Somme River through Amiens and Arras to Abbeville on the English Channel. Allied prisoners numbered in the hundreds. Abbeville is only 60 miles away from the British port of Hastings, which is enough to serve as a base for bomber squadrons and paratroopers to attack England. (Taiwan Zhong Dispatch of the 22nd)

London: German troops reached the English Channel yesterday, only 60 miles from the port of Hastings. Britain has hastily stepped up its defenses, preparing for the first invasion of England by a foreign enemy in 874 years. Many fear that the British Navy, which has defended the country's integrity for many centuries, will be helpless against the German bomber squadrons and paratrooper tactics. Last night, a German plane was discovered off the southeast coast of England and was driven away by anti-aircraft guns. At the moment, defensive posts to annihilate paratroopers have been set up everywhere in London. Military circles do not recognize the German advance to Abbeville on the English Channel as a victorious battle, because the strongholds broken through by the German mechanized units have not yet consolidated their positions. (United Press dispatch of the 22nd)

German Military Communiqué

Berlin: This afternoon, the German military report stated that yesterday's German actions were to advance northwest with the English Channel as the target. German military aircraft attacked the ports of Ostend, Dunkirk, Béthune, and Dieppe. The enemy forces in the Flanders region stubbornly resisted. In the Valenciennes area, the German army launched a fierce attack on the enemy. The enemy's attempts to break through to the southwest were unsuccessful. British tank units were defeated in the Arras area. German Junkers bombers made the greatest contribution to repelling the British tanks. In the battle of Zeeland a few days ago, the German army won more with less and captured 1,600 French soldiers. The enemy forces in the area of Neufchâtel-Hardelot have been defeated, the fortress has been occupied by the German army, 12 officers have been captured, and 500 soldiers have been captured. The main purpose of the German Air Force's activities yesterday was to prevent the enemy's retreat. Many enemy air force bases and aircraft were destroyed. The train stations at Compiègne and Creil were hit and caught fire. Near the coast of France and Belgium, German aircraft destroyed one cruiser, one cargo ship, and eleven military ships. Several other ships were also destroyed. A total of 120 enemy planes were lost yesterday, and 10 German planes are missing. (Haitong dispatch of the 22nd)

German Front Line on the Western Front: General Reichnau, commander of the German Sixth Army, told foreign reporters at his headquarters yesterday that the final decisive battle has not yet arrived. At the moment, it is still the initial encounter battle, and the German army is only initially testing its victory, and has not yet engaged the main force of the enemy army. However, a great war will definitely occur, and we are prepared to achieve victory. He also said that so far in the offensive, the German losses are only one-tenth of the prisoners captured. Reichnau did not specify the exact number of German losses, but said that based on an estimate of the number of Allied prisoners captured, it should be around 11,000 to 12,000 people.

Weigand Exerts All His Strength to Save the Critical Situation, Confident He Has a Grasp On It

Paris – Premier and Minister of National Defense Reynaud recently addressed the press, stating roughly: "General Weigand, Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces, has just returned to the capital from the front. According to his account, if the nation can, with unyielding perseverance, fulfill its responsibilities, then I am extremely confident about the future of the war." The Commander-in-Chief has spoken thus, and all our countrymen must not harbor fear because of the enemy's motorized forces. These forces are no different from the cavalry of old; if they become excessively rampant, they will inevitably become uncontrollable. At this critical juncture, all countrymen must exert themselves for the country and not remain idle at home. Understand that even a small reduction in production weakens the nation's strength. Therefore, the government will immediately issue orders to military and political authorities to pay attention to this at all times. In short, if we can hold out for one month (in reality, we are determined to hold out to the end), we will have already achieved three-quarters of the victory." (Havas dispatch, 22nd)

Paris – A military spokesman here announced last night that General Weigand is now on the battlefield, making all necessary decisions, the results of which remain to be seen. Although the situation is extremely serious, we can maintain confidence and wait for it. It is noted that General Weigand has now replaced General Gamelin as the Commander-in-Chief of the Allied forces in all theaters. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)

French Counteroffensive Wins, London Greatly Excited

London – The news that French forces have retaken Arras after fierce fighting has had a stimulating effect in London. The public spirit is greatly boosted. Some quarters interpret this as an indication that France, under the leadership of General Weigand, has begun a major counteroffensive. While we cannot be overly optimistic about the current victory, experts believe that this may be the initial action to stop the German advance from Abbeville towards the coast. The news of the recapture of Arras has made the stock exchange more stable, with various prominent government bonds seeing a rebound. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)

French Ninth Army Suffers Setback, Rumor of General Giraud's Capture Unconfirmed

Paris – German propaganda organs have issued news stating that General Giraud, commander of the French Ninth Army, and his staff have been captured. Informed sources here have denied this. (Havas dispatch, 21st)

London – The "News Chronicle" reports that "at this time, our only virtue is courage, and our only vice is uttering defeat." Although the Ninth Army has suffered a setback, the other great forces of France remain undamaged and have yet to engage the enemy in a decisive battle. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)

Natural Barrier of the Aisne River Easy to Defend, German Forces' Forced Crossing Ultimately Unsuccessful

Paris – Military figures here have recently stated that German light units have occupied the cities of Amiens and Arras. However, there is no official confirmation of German claims that they have occupied Abbeville at the mouth of the Somme River. The British Expeditionary Force is engaged in fierce fighting with German forces. The number of British troops is still unknown. In the Cambrai sector, repeated German advances have been blocked. French forces are now holding new positions. German forces have repeatedly attempted to force a crossing of the Aisne River, whether in the west, in the east, or in the area around Rethel, but have not succeeded. This shows that rivers are inherently natural barriers; simply destroying bridges prevents tank columns from advancing. As for the Somme River, it is also being firmly defended by French forces. From the Somme River to the Rhine River, French forces are now deploying, with a neat military appearance. They are extremely confident that they will be able to meet any German advance head-on and win. (Havas dispatch, 21st)

German Aircraft Appear Over Paris, Air Raid Alarm Twice in One Night in England

Berlin – Yesterday, German air force planes reached the skies over Paris, but whether it was reconnaissance or bombing is not yet known. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 22nd)

The wailing of the alarm was mingled with the whistle blowing of air raid wardens. Air raid lights were turned on everywhere. The sound of aircraft could be clearly heard. According to an announcement from the Ministry of Aviation, an air raid alarm was issued and lifted one hour later last night. When a German plane approached a certain city on the southeast coast last night, no air raid alarm was issued. The plane dropped bombs into the sea near the coast, seemingly attempting to bomb ships, but missed. Naval patrol boats opened fire, but the German plane flew over the city and then turned south. Continuing intense gunfire was subsequently heard in the south. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)

### British House of Commons Authorizes Government to Control National Resources: Attlee Explains Bill, Responsibility of All to Save the Critical Situation

London – The Leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons, Attlee, stated today after questioning, regarding the serious situation: "I am now informing the House that, given the current critical situation, the government has no choice but to request the House to grant special powers through a bill. This bill must pass through all stages in both Houses today. Every member is deeply aware of the seriousness of the overall situation, and every member knows that yesterday hung in the balance. The great war is now underway. Our soldiers on the sea, land, and air are now engaged in battle with bright courage, loyalty, and skill (cheers), aided by the freedom-loving people of our Allied nations. We cannot yet know the outcome of the current great war, but everyone should understand that the coming weeks are critical. The brutal enemy, disregarding international law and fairness or humanity, is now pouring all its resources into winning. We will not allow them to succeed (cheers). The government firmly believes that the time has come for us to mobilize our nation's entire resources to the utmost. We must exert all our strength to engage in the struggle. Every private interest must be sacrificed to meet the urgent needs of the nation. We cannot know what will be revealed in the coming weeks or days, but whatever may come, we will face it, for Englishmen have encountered danger in the past and overcome it. But as necessity dictates, the government must now be granted complete control over people and property, not just over certain individuals or certain strata of the population, but over the entire nation, rich and poor, employers and workers, men and women, or property, without distinction. The power I am requesting in the House this afternoon is this kind of power. I am not requesting it in a spirit of panic; there is no need for panic today. However, what we are requesting is that, in this time of rapid change, the necessary powers that are or will be needed be granted to the government. To ensure that this bill passes through all stages, it must be moved as a temporary motion. The government asks this House, in light of the serious danger the nation is now in, to approve this procedure. The form of the resolution is the same as the motion proposed in August of last year for requesting the immediate passage of the Emergency Powers (Defence) Act original bill." The Emergency Powers (Defence) Act, mentioned by Attlee, was announced this afternoon. The bill expands the powers exercised by the King under the Emergency Powers (Defence) Act of 1939, stating: "In light of the development of the war since that day, it is now imperative to expand the powers mentioned above so that, when needed, the entire resources of the nation can be immediately used for purposes related to the defense of the nation. All personnel and their duties, and their property, may be dispatched by the King to ensure public safety, defend the nation, maintain public order, or effectively conduct the war, and all services necessary to maintain supplies or the people's livelihood may be ordered by the Cabinet." The bill was explained by Attlee, debated for less than an hour, and the House of Commons unanimously passed the second reading. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)

### British Minister of Information Broadcasts Speech, Convinced Allied Forces Will Turn the Tide

London – Minister of Information Duff Cooper delivered a broadcast speech last night, saying: "Although the news is quite serious at present, there is no reason for alarm. The Germans are using a new technology, allowing small units of German troops to penetrate deeply, but these are only small units. British forces and a larger number of French forces are still present, have not retreated, and have not suffered significant losses. It is impossible to know the true situation while the war is ongoing. From the fragments of information we receive, it is easy to make various conjectures. There are three facts that can be stated with certainty: (1) The Germans' current objective is the ports of the English Channel, hoping to attack Britain from there. (2) A small part of the German mechanized forces has bypassed its opponents and penetrated a great distance, and is approaching its target. (3) The British and French forces have not been defeated. They occupy the battlefield with absolutely superior numbers. When the time for a counterattack arrives, they will prove the dreadfulness of their power. The temporary fortunes of war are not of great importance; the most important thing is the outcome. I explained to you last week that the outcome of this war, no matter what, cannot place Britain and France in a position of failure. This situation is generally well-known, but those who are in the midst of it often cannot help but be surprised by it. The sudden advance with unexpected force, and the gains made at the beginning, are often beyond expectation. This was also true of the German offensives in August 1914 and March 1918 during the Great War. Therefore, we hope that the Germans will have the same ending this time. We must all fulfill our responsibilities, for the war is now so close to our shores that we are, in effect, already in the midst of it. The first thing we must have is courage. I firmly believe that we do not lack this quality. I now once again warn the people against the danger of rumors. My personal experience this afternoon is a perfect example..."

### Further Interpretation of Reynaud's Speech

"...because according to a very reliable report, it was said that the French Premier had declared that nothing could save his country except a miracle. Although I do not believe that the steadfast and striving Reynaud would make such a statement, I was quite fearful at the time and relayed this matter to several friends, but I did not understand until I read his speech that it was completely different from what was rumored. Reynaud's speech expressed the highest confidence; he firmly believed that nothing could defeat the combined forces of Britain and France, and said that if tomorrow or the day after, anyone with a weak will were to tell him that nothing but a miracle could save France, he would confidently declare that such a miracle would be realized because he had the belief to save France. I firmly believe that the current serious events have been a tonic for the whole nation, for a calm and resolute spirit can be seen everywhere. The situation in the House of Commons this afternoon was very different from before the recess. I cannot help but recall Macaulay's famous saying, 'None for party, all for the state.' Our original partisan opinions were very deep in the past, and perhaps they will be again in the future, but for now, they have been set aside and are no longer useful. Those of us in the rear must each fulfill our duties, just like the soldiers who are on guard tonight on the front lines or who will be attacking the enemy at dawn tomorrow. They should know that behind the stable front lines, there is great trust backing them up." (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)

### British Aircraft Fly to the Front Lines, Bombing German Tank Columns: Large Forest Fire North of the Aisne River, Fierce Fighting in the Skies Over France and Belgium

London – The British Air Ministry announced last night, "British Blenheim aircraft attacked enemy armored vehicles in the Arras and Cambrai sectors this morning with good results. In the afternoon, British aircraft flew to the Arras and Bapaume sectors and carried out intense bombing. All our aircraft have returned to base. At night, a large squadron of British Air Force bombers attacked enemy troops concentrated in the Cambrai, Le Cateau, and Saint-Quentin sectors, and attacked enemy troops in the Neuville-Saint-Vaast forest north of the Aisne River. Several large fires broke out in the forest. Five of our aircraft did not return from this operation. Today, our bombers and fighters engaged enemy aircraft in continuous combat in the skies over Belgium and the northern front in France. Yesterday afternoon, heavy anti-aircraft fire occurred twice off the southeastern coast, with the buzzing of aircraft heard at high altitude before and after the firing." (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)

London – A British Air Ministry communiqué stated that German forces advancing on the battlefields of Arras, Bapaume, Saint-Quentin, and Cambrai in France were subjected to repeated attacks by British forces all night Monday. Tanks, armored vehicles, troop carriers, and reinforcements were heavily bombed. A squadron of Blenheim British bombers discovered a motor vehicle transport column a mile long and attacked it. Another aircraft saw troop movement in the Neuville-Saint-Vaast forest, dropped several bombs, and a fire broke out and spread rapidly within minutes. British aircraft also bombed and strafed the head and middle of a convoy of cargo trucks near Le Cateau, scattering the convoy. A train outside Le Cateau was also hit by two bombs.

### British Military and Civilians Cooperate to Strictly Prevent German Paratroopers from Landing: Civilian Defense Organizations Rapidly Established

London – As German forces advance even closer to the British coast, preparations are being accelerated within Britain to prevent German paratroopers from landing and the activities of the "Fifth Column." The authorities are now considering obliterating the names of village railway stations to prevent German paratroopers from finding their destinations by map. National civilian defense organizations have been rapidly established. The threat of enemy invasion only strengthens the people's calm and determined resolve. New civilian defense teams are now being trained on how to track paratroopers as soon as they land. It is said that because German paratroopers carry hand-held machine guns with a range of 500 yards, observers must conceal themselves well to avoid being harmed. In addition, civilians are being notified that if several German paratroopers occupy a village, they must try to destroy food and drink and stay indoors until armed defense teams arrive to rescue them. Defense team leaders across the country have listed the targets of German paratroopers as stations, intersections, factories, bridges, and unharvested crops, because only a few small incendiary bombs are needed to cause significant damage. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)

Paris – According to news received here, German paratroopers carrying incendiary equipment and explosives seem to have greatly aided the German advance north of the Somme River in the past two days. After landing, they immediately went to railway junctions, stations, bridges, and public buildings to cause disruption. It is said that even if a large number of these paratroopers were to land, although they might cause a serious situation, they could not achieve a firm occupation without the help of a very large land force.

### Key Belgian Cabinet Members Have Not Left the Country, Belgian King Seeks Refuge in Le Havre

A member of the Belgian Cabinet and Minister of Justice, Johnson, tonight delivered a broadcast address to "French Friends and Belgian Compatriots," stating roughly that Premier Pierlot, Foreign Minister Spaak, Minister of National Defense General Denis, and Interior Minister Vanderpoorten all remain within the country, maintaining close contact with King Leopold III and the national army. As for some cabinet members in Sainte-Adresse, France, they are now trying to resolve some urgent and serious difficulties, such as the large number of our refugees who have gone to France to seek refuge, among whom are thousands of strong men who are willing to serve the country. If they can be trained, the strength of our army will definitely be enriched. Once the new army is established, our army will have a million strong men to defend the motherland and will not easily give up an inch of land. All our people must strictly observe discipline and maintain calm. "Under the leadership of the King, give your life to save the country, and be the backbone of the army. The motto we should follow today is only composure, courage, and trust." (Havas dispatch, 21st)

### US Congress to Discuss Appropriations to Strengthen Pacific Defense Line: Walsh and Vinson Submit Proposals to Senate and House, Advocating Major Funds to Develop 21 Defenses

Washington – Congress is now prepared to discuss another new naval bill provided by the government, which appropriates US$29,587,000 to immediately strengthen US defenses in the Pacific. Although the bill does not mention appropriations to develop the defenses of Guam, it advocates using US$5,582,000 to develop the defenses of Wake Island, one of the two major projects in the new defense plan. The reason Guam is not mentioned in the bill is fear of causing congressional debate and delaying the bill's passage. It is noteworthy that the bill includes defense funds for Wake Island, as the US Navy has never before received large sums of money to develop this Pacific outpost. According to congressional sources last night, this new defense bill is part of President Roosevelt's US$3,000,000,000 defense budget and should be passed soon. The bill was submitted to the Senate yesterday by Walsh, Chairman of the Senate Naval Affairs Committee. In the House, the bill was introduced by Vinson, Chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee. The funds in the bill are to be used to acquire land sufficient for the construction of Pacific defenses and to increase the US Air Force in the Pacific. (United Press dispatch, 22nd)

Washington – Senate Naval Affairs Committee Chairman Walsh and House Naval Affairs Committee Chairman Vinson, after holding a meeting today with President Roosevelt and naval authorities, have submitted bills to their respective committees with two main points: (1) The total number of naval aircraft should be increased to 10,000 within two to three years, and the number of pilots should be increased to 16,000, with an estimated cost of US$250,000,000. (2) Twenty-one locations across the United States coast and naval bases, excluding Guam, should organize defenses in both land and air, with an estimated cost of US$123,132,000, and it will take three to five years to complete all of them. The names of the twenty-one locations are listed below: Norfolk, Virginia; San Juan, Puerto Rico; Panama Canal Zone; Seattle, Washington; Alaskan Peninsula; Pearl Harbor, Hawaii; Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii; Midway Island; Wake Island; Johnston Island; Quonset Point, Rhode Island; Quantico, Virginia; Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; Virgin Islands; Charlotte Amalie, Virgin Islands; San Diego, California; Alameda, California; Unalaska Island, Aleutian Islands; Canton Island; Tongue Point, Oregon; Corpus Christi, Texas. (Havas dispatch, 21st)

Washington – A joint statement by Senate and House Naval Affairs Committee Chairmen Walsh and Vinson stated that President Roosevelt proposed using US$100 million to build naval aviation facilities and train naval aviation personnel, and will submit a bill requesting an additional US$125,000,000 to establish and develop naval aviation bases. The two committees are also taking major action against "Fifth Column" activities, as they have approved measures to dismiss suspicious workers and soldiers. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)

### President Roosevelt Issues Statement: German Planes Bomb Refugees, Welles Meets with British and French Ambassadors

Washington - President Roosevelt, yesterday at a reception for newspaper reporters, denounced the German planes' strafing of French refugees, stating that German planes descended rapidly over French territory and fiercely strafed refugees on the road. The number of refugee casualties is unprecedented. He believes America will understand the implications of this type of warfare. Regarding the phrase "implications," President Roosevelt did not clarify what he thought was implied, but stated that America is united in the current situation. The faster news arrives from Europe, the more united the American people become. Along a two-mile front in France, there are now five million women and children, mostly walking or riding in vehicles, fleeing south along various roads and being strafed by German planes. President Roosevelt's attitude was calm when he condemned the German planes' strafing of French women, children, and the elderly, but he showed sincerity, deeply moving the newspaper reporters. President Roosevelt also revealed the following three points regarding the general discussion policy of the defense program: (1) Not to allow Americans to become immensely wealthy from overseas war disasters; (2) Laborers must not seek their own benefit in the current emergency situation; (3) The government absolutely does not intend to weaken the social achievements it has made in the past two years. (Reuter's dispatch on the 22nd)

Washington - When the Senate began debating the Army supply bill yesterday, Democratic Senator Chamberlain stated, "The European war in the next few days may become a turning point in civilization." Chamberlain introduced a resolution authorizing President Roosevelt to sell any existing military aircraft and cash from the U.S. Army and Navy to the Allied powers. (Reuter's dispatch on the 22nd)

Washington - President Roosevelt stated that he is aware that Democratic Senator Pepper has submitted a bill to the Senate proposing to authorize the President to sell existing aircraft of the Army and Navy to Britain and France, but he refused to express an opinion. Observers generally believe that the purpose of this bill is to test the opinions of members of Congress in order to ascertain the extent to which the U.S. government can assist Britain and France. Moreover, this bill proposes to sell aircraft to Britain and France, which is tantamount to explicitly prohibiting the sale of these aircraft to Germany. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is scheduled to meet tomorrow to discuss this bill. (Havas dispatch on the 21st)

Washington - Undersecretary of State Welles recently held talks with British Ambassador Lord Lothian and French Ambassador Saint-Quentin to discuss the European situation. (Havas dispatch on the 21st)

### Pan-American Mutual Defense Agreement Under Discussion in U.S. Political Circles

Washington - Today, political and diplomatic circles here are discussing the conclusion of a new international agreement in the Americas, jointly defending North and South America against external aggression, as the main topic of discussion. Washington officials stated that President Roosevelt's recent proposal for a $3,000,000,000 bill to fund national defense does not yet involve international defense steps. However, these steps may not be realized until Congress passes this massive national defense bill. Military observers believe that President Roosevelt's defense plan must include agreements with other countries in the Western Hemisphere, enabling the United States to build naval and air bases in South America. (United Press dispatch on the 22nd)

### European War Intensifies, Shaking the American People, Criticism of Isolationist Policies, Attack on Colonel Lindbergh

Washington - The American people have been shaken frequently in the past two weeks. Germany's declaration today that it has reached the English Channel has caused a new shock. Coupled with newspapers filled with thrilling news, the public has risen up to criticize the Republican Party, as its isolationist policy is based on the invincibility of the Allied powers. In the past few months, President Roosevelt has tried to awaken public opinion and draw attention to the increasing danger in Europe, but the Republican Party has called it unwarranted alarmism. Colonel Lindbergh has also been heavily criticized, and many have denounced him as pro-German, as Lindbergh once claimed that the government's defense plan was a delusional call for aggression. At the same time, Congress is now passing national defense legislation at a very rapid pace, and there are many proposals advocating unlimited actions, such as selling the entire U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force to the Allied powers so that they can curb the rampant barbarity of the Axis powers and seize several islands in the British West Indies as defense bases. (Reuter's dispatch on the 22nd)

### Intense Activity in Rome's Army and Air Force, Strong War Atmosphere, Italian Prime Minister Scheduled to Deliver Speech Tomorrow, Britain Seeks to Re-engage with Italy

Rome - The general public is increasingly influenced by the propaganda of "opportunity must not be lost" and is now preparing for an inevitable decision. Many people now believe that Italy's entry into the war is only a matter of time. Air activity is becoming more frequent in important central locations, and Rome had fully armed troops parading yesterday, so the war atmosphere is becoming more intense. (Reuter's dispatch on the 22nd)

Rome - There are rumors here that Mussolini will deliver a speech in Naples on Friday, and whether or not Italy will enter the war will be decided in this speech. Political figures here are remaining silent about the rumors. (Haitong News Agency dispatch on the 22nd)

Rome - According to the Rome News Agency, which is authorized by the government, although the tension still exists, there is no reason for excessive panic. It would be a mistake to draw hasty conclusions based on Foreign Minister Ciano's speech in Milan. Italy's position on the current war is still as originally decided. Italy has tried to prevent the outbreak of war and then to localize it. A large area of Europe has been preserved to this day, and the meaning of this situation does not mean that Italy can cease to consider its sovereign rights with respect to the issues caused by the naval blockade of the Mediterranean. Rome is paying close attention to the current situation, and Italy must maintain its natural aspirations, but the means used must be determined by the changes in the situation. Therefore, it seems too early to make predictions at present. (Reuter's dispatch on the 22nd)

Rome - Foreign Minister Ciano, along with the Director of the Albanian Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, went to Albania late today to inspect public works in various places. (Havas dispatch on the 21st)

Rome - A telegram from Cairo yesterday stated that the Egyptian government is now organizing troops led by the Bedouins of Libya. It is reported that once the organization is completed, they will be stationed in the Egyptian-Libyan border area to take on the defense of that area. The Bedouins fled to Egypt during the Libyan war. People here believe that Egypt's deployment of troops in the Libyan border area is an unfriendly attitude towards Italy. It is also reported here that American expatriates have left Egypt. (Haitong News Agency dispatch on the 22nd)

Gibraltar - Women and children in Gibraltar are being evacuated. The first batch will depart for French Morocco starting today and tomorrow. According to official announcements, the Governor-General has received instructions from the British War Cabinet, stating that due to the international situation, the Governor-General of Gibraltar should consider immediately forcing the evacuation of women and children. It is also announced that there is no need to worry about Spain's intentions, as Spain has reiterated its absolute neutrality. (Reuter's dispatch on the 22nd)

### Germany Plunders Balkan Resources, But Does Not Want War, Romania Mobilizes Reservists

Capital City of Southern Country - Diplomatic observers here recently stated that Germany's policy in the Balkan Peninsula and the Danube River Basin is to plunder the material resources of that area at any cost. Therefore, although Germany often threatens the Balkan countries with force, it also does not want to expand the war in that peninsula. If this corner of Europe suffers war, the transportation of Romanian oil and Yugoslavian food to Germany will be interrupted. At this time, all countries in Southeast Europe have taken various measures to prevent foreign expatriates from moving arbitrarily. However, the German minorities within those countries are restless and are still working for Germany. These people's attitudes have recently become increasingly arrogant, even making demands for "equal treatment" and conducting military training in secret. For example, Germans in Southern countries have suddenly developed a special interest in mechanical aspects of various sports programs and have recently purchased 10,000 motorcycles from German manufacturers. Their intention is noteworthy. (Havas dispatch on the 21st)

Capital City of Romania - The General Headquarters recently issued a communiqué stating that most of the reservists have been mobilized and can be incorporated into units within 24 hours. Part-time soldiers must also return to camp immediately. This mobilization plan does not apply to workers who are building fortifications and railways/highways, as well as employees in the coal/oil industry, and officials in various government departments. According to observers, the Romanian army has reached 1.3 million men. (Havas dispatch on the 22nd)

Turkish Capital - The Afghan Embassy here solemnly denied yesterday the rumors spread abroad that the Soviet Union was concentrating troops in the Soviet-Afghan border area. (Haitong News Agency dispatch on the 22nd)

### Japan's Wartime System Like Patching a Leaky Roof, Current Situation Worsening, Danger of Being Uncontrollable

Tokyo - Abe Shinnosuke, editor-in-chief of the Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun, spoke frankly and recently wrote an article criticizing the reorganization of the National Spiritual Mobilization Movement and the various living conditions within Japan, stating that since the outbreak of the China Incident, three years have passed, but Japan has not yet established what can be called a truly wartime organization, only using expedient measures to patch up the overall situation, like repairing a leaky roof. These leaks are now in danger of becoming more serious and uncontrollable. The National Spiritual Mobilization Movement was started to correct the shortcomings of our country's current system, but this movement has been carried out in an unhealthy state and has been found to be inconsistent with the actual situation. A movement that is inconsistent with the actual situation is bound to fail. Therefore, the Yonai cabinet has implemented a severe reorganization of this movement. According to the author's observation, the people who faithfully follow the lifestyle stipulated by the old Spiritual Mobilization Corps are in a very difficult situation, as these people do not hoard goods or engage in illegal transactions. Many of them eat the lowest grade of food, sweet potato porridge, and are unable to even buy a basket of charcoal, and their children die of pneumonia. The reason for this is simply loyalty to the country. On the other hand, there are people who engage in improper transactions and make huge profits, and there are many such people. This kind of contradiction in people's attitudes gives an extremely bad impression. The problem of controlling prices is difficult to deal with because it is too complicated. Some say that the Yonai cabinet will not last long, and the most serious incident it has encountered is the deadlock between the low-price policy and the distribution of materials. Last year, the government adopted a policy to make people eat seven-tenths of high-grade rice mixed with brown rice and halved the rice used for brewing sake in order to prevent a grain shortage this year. If implemented, each policy can save 50 million bushels of rice per year. However, on the other hand, this measure has caused a shortage of chicken feed, resulting in a reduction in egg production, and a shortage of pig feed, so they are slaughtered early. We are now using the rice we usually eat to feed livestock. Japanese people lack a systematic plan for important events, which is their characteristic. The price of rice has soared, and elementary school teachers have been greatly affected. Some have devoted themselves to improving the treatment of elementary school teachers, but it has been rejected by the government because it may affect other social situations. Just like adding water to wine, teachers have no choice but to reduce the materials on which their lives depend. In short, all matters are currently based on a subsistence policy, without regard for other things. (Reuter's dispatch on the 22nd)

### Shanxi Church Activities Not Interrupted

London - Undersecretary Butler declared in the House of Commons yesterday that, to his knowledge, church activities in Shanxi have not been interrupted. Any steps taken by church groups to provide medical and educational facilities in Shanxi Province and other Japanese-occupied areas are supplementing the work done by the state, not replacing it. Labor MP Davidson followed up with a question, asking whether Britain's policy on this matter was one of complete neutrality. If so, he should not forget Prime Minister Churchill's remarks on neutrality. The Undersecretary replied that he did not fully understand all the implications, but what he could say was that their policy was to achieve as much improvement as possible. Labor MP Noel-Baker also asked whether any news had been received from the Chinese Embassy regarding the recent great victories claimed by the Chinese side in the war. The Undersecretary replied that the Chinese Ambassador, Guo Taiqi, had recently provided us with information of this nature. (Reuter's dispatch on the 22nd)

### Belgian Ambassador Solicits Donations

Chongqing - Belgium, as a neutral country, has once again been invaded. Since the start of the war, there have been many casualties. The Belgian Ambassador to China recently issued a notice soliciting donations for the Belgian Red Cross, stating that Belgium, as a neutral country, has been suddenly invaded. Since the start of the war, thousands have been injured and disabled. It is believed that only the Chinese people can deeply understand the suffering of the Belgian people and provide compassionate assistance. The Ambassador is now collecting donations from friends of Belgium for the Belgian Red Cross to rescue the injured and deceased. If you are willing to donate generously, please send your donations to the Belgian Embassy at 20 Niujiaotuo, Chongqing. The Ambassador extends his gratitude on behalf of all the people of Belgium.

(Clinic) 2nd Floor, China Trust Company, intersection of Beijing Road and Sichuan Road (Hours) 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM, closed Sundays The Threshold of Being a Husband How to Make Your Wife Love You Forever? ...

We know what a healthy and intelligent wife's only hope for her husband is. Undoubtedly, she hopes her husband can give her the truest and fullest love. In other words: a love that occupies her whole heart and soul, a united love of spirit and flesh. Indeed, when a man with abundant energy and a strong physique comes to woo his wife with ardent love, his wife cannot help but welcome him wholeheartedly! Thus, the couple's life is intimate and sweet, making her heart drunk, her emotions joyful, and making her feel the preciousness of her husband and the joy of life. If a man can always maintain the strength of his energy, so that his marital life can always be happy, then his wife will definitely love her beloved husband forever, build a happy family, and bear clever children. How happy life is!

But if a husband has no threshold and does not seek to increase his energy, or has even committed self-indulgence and wanton licentiousness, damaging the endocrine fluid in his reproductive glands, then his energy will inevitably decline, and he will have symptoms such as kidney deficiency, impotence, underdevelopment, thin sperm infertility, and premature aging. Then, even if he has a beautiful wife like a flower, how can he enjoy the grace of beauty? Or even be completely unable to perform his conjugal duties, ashamed to face his wife! If such a husband does not quickly seek to remedy his defects, how can his wife continue to sacrifice and waste her youth? Therefore, some become ill with depression, suffering from anemia, menstrual disorders, infertility, and breast and face decay; others have illicit affairs or elope due to sexual urges; or even righteously file lawsuits against their husbands in court, initiating divorce proceedings, which is also a common occurrence in today's society. How miserable the husband is at this time!

However, it is no longer difficult for a husband to seek to enhance his energy and cure his hidden diseases in today's era of flourishing medicine.

Health and Beauty

### Breast Beauty Lies in the Activeness of Early Summer

— Yao Chongpei, American Doctor of Medicine

Fair young lady in the prime of youth,

Snowy skin, flowery face, and jade-like makeup,

Most captivating to the soul,

Shaking and heaving bosom.

The most noticeable and captivating thing on a woman's body is her pair of breasts. Look: the weather is gradually getting hotter these days, and most fashionable ladies who are at the forefront of fashion have already put on new summer clothes. The material is so thin, and the body is so full. Because the size, length, and width are moderate, the curves of their whole body are fully revealed. The one-step-three-bend movement is enough to make you lose your mind, how can you bear the pair of breasts on her chest, which stand proudly and shake her clothes, as if they are showing off to people and greeting everyone who is watching. People are not made of wood or stone, how can they not feel hot in their hearts and weak in their legs when they see such healthy and beautiful ladies? Therefore, such ladies, in today's age when women must have "health beauty," have taken full advantage of all kinds of advantages, and the result of happiness is naturally limitless!

But then again, if in the past, due to breast self-indulgence, menstrual disorders, excessive bleeding, nutritional disorders, or weak multiple births, the function of the ovaries was damaged, affecting metabolism, and leading to breast atrophy, thin hips, and loss of curves, then even with makeup and beautiful clothes, she is not worth a glance from a man of the times. As a result, she will be rejected everywhere, and her fate will be very tragic! The only remedy does not need to be sought elsewhere. Just take women's "Reproductive Element" three times a day, two tablets each time, for four consecutive weeks, and you will feel an increased appetite and a relaxed body. Continue to take it for another three weeks, and the atrophied breasts will rise and bulge, and at the same time, the hips will become plump, the muscles smooth, and the cheeks more delicate.

### The Seriousness of Seminal Emission Syndrome

— Venereal Disease Specialist Zhan Nianhui

Enough to bury youth and happiness, and delay the promising future of young people!

After a man passes the period of spring passion, seminal emission is inevitable, but if he is officially suffering from seminal emission syndrome, then its seriousness cannot be ignored. Originally, there are two types of seminal emission, physiological and pathological. Physiological seminal emission is due to the excessive production of semen in the body, or an occasional seminal emission within a few months, and there is no feeling of fatigue, dizziness, or other abnormalities the next day. This phenomenon is called overflowing sperm by doctors to distinguish it from seminal emission. If suffering from seminal emission syndrome, there will be two or three or more emissions per month, and there will be a feeling of fatigue and discomfort after the emission. When young people encounter this phenomenon, they must seek medical treatment as soon as possible. If it is not treated in time, the number of emissions will gradually increase, or even to the point where they emit semen at the sight of beauty, or even emit semen during the day, becoming sperm leakage syndrome. At the same time, due to the depletion of semen in the body, symptoms such as brain decay, forgetfulness, insomnia, palpitations, back pain, kidney deficiency, impotence, and underdevelopment will inevitably erupt one after another. As a result, learning is not progressing, studying is unsuccessful, and the future is ruined! And it will be disliked by women, hated by wives and concubines, and the happiness of life will be lost!

Seminal emission is not an incurable disease. Patients only need to take the special medicine for seminal emission, "Hymid's Semen-Consolidating Tablets," and they can achieve the effect of sleeping peacefully and stopping seminal emission that night. If there are already the above-mentioned symptoms due to seminal emission, take both the gonadotropin preparation "Reproductive Element" to fundamentally cultivate and tonify the brain, kidneys, essence, and blood, and you can quickly restore perfect health. If patients can come to our clinic for diagnosis and treatment in person, we can guarantee a cure.

### Ironclad Facts

— Recorded by Venereal Disease Specialist Zhan Nian-zeng

(I) Nocturnal Emission and Spermatorrhea Can Lead to Youthful Demise

Mr. Qin Zhi, age twenty, is from Hangzhou. His father is a real estate merchant, and the family is quite wealthy. He is currently a senior in high school at a certain middle school in M埠. Because he is naturally intelligent and excels in both character and academics, he is prone to being led astray by his cleverness. Mr. Qin developed romantic feelings early on and couldn't help but engage in love affairs with female classmates, exchanging love letters as a habit. Overwhelmed by longing, he couldn't restrain himself and committed masturbation. Despite repeated attempts to quit, he couldn't decisively break the habit, leading to weakened sperm control and subsequent spermatorrhea. Initially, it occurred two or three times a month, gradually increasing to five or six times. At first, it was due to dreams, but later it happened even without dreams. As a result, he felt mentally exhausted, suffered from memory loss and weakened brain function, insomnia, palpitations, and other symptoms. With slight exertion, he experienced lower back pain, fatigue, and weakness. His grades, once consistently in the top tier, now frequently fell below passing, posing a serious risk of dropping out or repeating a grade! During the spring break, he caught a cold and was bedridden for several days. He worried he was doomed to an early death! Therefore, he earnestly requested treatment (as narrated by the patient himself). Mr. Qin came to my clinic for treatment at the beginning of last month. After diagnosis, it was determined that his condition was indeed due to untreated spermatorrhea. I immediately instructed him to purchase two boxes of the "Hemitol Coagulant Tablets," a specific drug for spermatorrhea, and two dozen vials of the reproductive gland extract "Reproductive Essence" to take concurrently. After the spermatorrhea subsided, he continued to take "Reproductive Essence" and received Delemen's electrotherapy simultaneously. After more than a month, he felt clear-headed and energetic, and the aforementioned symptoms had completely disappeared.

(II) A Husband with Premature Ejaculation and Impotence Causes Suffering to His Wife

Mr. Shen Ke-xian, age thirty, works in the banking industry. After marriage, he developed symptoms of kidney deficiency and impotence, with occasional nocturnal emissions. As a result, marital relations were not fulfilling, or even impossible. This was not only unfulfilling for himself but also caused great suffering to his wife. He had tried various tonics and supplements on the market, but they had little effect. Recently, his body felt increasingly weak, so he sought treatment (as narrated above). After examining his condition, I instructed him to purchase three dozen vials of "Reproductive Essence" and one box of "Hemitol Coagulant Tablets," and he received daily electrotherapy injections and other medical treatments. After two months, Mr. Shen felt energized and strong, and all his symptoms had disappeared. The couple's love deepened further.

### Maintaining the Shanghai Status Quo: The Attitude of All Nations Is Extremely Firm; All Support Admiral Hepburn's Opinion; European War Developments Will Not Have Any Impact

After Admiral Hepburn, commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, arrived in Shanghai, he considered that the European war was increasingly expanding, and that European countries such as England, France, and Italy all had a portion of their defense forces in China. As a precautionary measure, Hepburn consulted with the commanders of the defense forces of various countries stationed in China to jointly maintain the status quo. Therefore, the Shanghai International Settlement would not be affected by other disputes related to the European war, which greatly pleased the people. However, Commander Takeda of the Shanghai Japanese Naval Landing Force suddenly convened a meeting of the commanders of the British, French, American, and Italian defense forces the day before yesterday (the 20th), leading to much speculation from the outside world. A reporter from the Heiminsha Newspaper specifically inquired about this matter to those close to the International Settlement authorities and those familiar with the diplomatic situation in Shanghai. According to reports, after Admiral Hepburn repeatedly contacted and consulted with the commanders of the defense forces of various countries in Shanghai, the military commanders of various countries stationed in Shanghai unanimously and enthusiastically supported Admiral Hepburn's concern for jointly maintaining security. Even if the European war were to develop in any way, no disputes or impacts that could potentially arise would occur in Shanghai. Although the Japanese side made a similar proposal the day before yesterday and convened a meeting of the commanders of the defense forces of various countries, the commanders of the European and American stationed forces still adhered to the same principles that Admiral Hepburn had previously consulted and agreed upon. It would be unwise for any party to cause disputes in Shanghai due to the European war. Therefore, the future of the Shanghai International Settlement is secure.

British Commander Visits Hepburn

General Grasset, commander of the British Army in China, left Hong Kong on the 18th and arrived in Shanghai on the 20th. He was accompanied by four important subordinates and staff members. They are currently staying at the residence of Major General Simmons, commander of the U.S. Army stationed in Shanghai. After arriving in Shanghai, General Grasset, accompanied by his entourage, visited Mr. Ke Zijiewei, the new Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession. The two gentlemen had a very pleasant meeting that lasted a short time. After taking a photo together, they parted. To understand the general situation in Shanghai, General Grasset traveled by car to the U.S. Asiatic Fleet on the morning of the 21st and boarded the flagship Augusta to visit Admiral Hepburn. General Grasset will not stay in Shanghai for long. This visit is purely a routine annual inspection. He is scheduled to leave Shanghai this Friday and head north to Tianjin and then to Beijing for inspections.

Churchill Cables Thanks to British Overseas Chinese in Shanghai

According to the English-language "Da Mei Evening News," when former British First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill took office as Prime Minister last week, various patriotic British overseas Chinese organizations in Shanghai, including the Chinese United Association, the British Women's Public Association, the British Chamber of Commerce, and the British Overseas Chinese United Association, jointly sent a congratulatory telegram to Churchill on his success. This telegram also received the full support of the heads of the four British overseas Chinese associations in the city: St. George, St. Andrew, St. Patrick, and St. David, as well as the Australian-New Zealand Association and the Canadian Association. This morning (the 22nd), Churchill replied, stating, "Humbled to receive your telegram of congratulations, deeply grateful for your earnest wishes. Churchill bows."

### The Balance of Power in the Far East Has Not Changed

The recent war in Europe has reached a serious stage, indirectly affecting the situation in the Far East. The United States has decided to use all its strength to maintain the status quo in the Far East to curb the delusions of ambitious individuals. It is rumored that the U.S. government, in view of the seriousness of the situation in the Far East, has ordered a powerful fleet stationed in Hawaii to sail to the Far East and be commanded by Hepburn. The fleet includes more than one hundred large and small warships, which will be deployed in Singapore and along the coast of China, with Singapore as the base, to prepare for any possible emergencies. According to a certain foreign professor at a well-known university in Shanghai,

The Balance of Power in the Far East

Will not be on the verge of collapse in the near future, and the development of this balance is absolutely beneficial to China. At the same time, since launching the war of aggression against China, Japan has lost its superior position as a first-class power, sinking deeper and deeper into the quagmire and unable to extricate itself. Its national policy has changed from being proactive to being passive, at a loss and not knowing what to do. Therefore, public opinion in the country has risen to criticize, with a strong sense of "Where is Japan going after all?" Therefore, Japan's influence on the balance of power in the Far East is far less obvious than before. According to the professor's observation, the

Important Factors

Affecting the balance of power in the Far East are two: (1) the Sino-Japanese War, (2) the attitude of the United States, and (3) the Soviet Union's Far Eastern policy. These three factors are intricately related and mutually constrained, allowing the status quo in the Pacific to be maintained. The United States is a democratic country, and its policies are mostly influenced by public opinion. The majority of the American public sympathizes with England and France in the current European war. However, even if the war develops in the future, they will only agree to lend money to England and France. Moreover, given the

Current Situation

The tension in the Pacific is no less than that in Europe. As for its Far Eastern policy, it emphasizes three points: (1) the United States will never recognize territories or interests obtained by violence; (2) it will use all means other than military force to pressure Japan to comply and maintain its interests in China; and (3) it will vigorously support the open door policy in China. The American public, especially those in cultural circles and those familiar with the situation in the Far East, such as Harvard University Professor Yan Lawrence, former U.S. Naval Commander in China Ya Luer, and Dr. Meng Lu, all

Sympathize with China's

Resistance and advocate for economic sanctions against Japan. However, the U.S. authorities still consider the timing immature and require further consideration. As for monitoring Japan's actions, they have always been unremitting. For example, they recently dispatched a fleet to permanently reside in Honolulu to warn Japan about maintaining the status quo in the Dutch East Indies. According to the professor, the U.S. authorities are also closely monitoring the defenses of the West Coast and Honolulu. Honolulu recently held blackout and air defense exercises.

### Over One Hundred Norwegian Ships: Shipping Operations Concentrated in Shanghai: Jardine Matheson & Co. Manager Diverts Ships to Both Europe-Asia and America-Asia Lines

After the outbreak of the European War, various ships sailing on the Europe-Asia routes were significantly affected. Due to concerns about sea mines and submarine attacks, sailing was extremely cautious. British and French ships changed their routes to the Cape of Good Hope and then to Europe via the Indian Ocean. China strictly adheres to neutrality, so trade and transportation are as normal as before the war. However, the number of ships from various countries being requisitioned by their governments has decreased. As for transportation on the Pacific routes, it has suddenly become prosperous.

More Than Twenty President Liners Added

The American President Lines has added more than twenty unscheduled ships. Recently, the Yomachichi arrived in Shanghai tomorrow morning, carrying more than 3,000 tons of tobacco, galvanized iron, and paper from the United States. The company's regular mail ship, President Taft, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai this morning at 10:00 AM from Xiaoluson via Zha Port, berthing at buoys 11 and 12. Passengers will transfer to a small launch and disembark at the Customs Wharf at approximately 11:00 AM this morning. The mail ship is scheduled to leave Shanghai for the United States at 9:30 PM tomorrow (the 24th). The last passenger launch will depart from the Customs Wharf at 8:00 PM tomorrow evening.

Regular Liners Transferred to the Atlantic

The regular mail ships of Jardine Matheson & Co. operating on the Pacific route (i.e., the America-Asia Line), such as the Pacific, the Taiping, the Taiyi, and the Sun, were transferred to the Atlantic route after the outbreak of the European War. Now, the majority of ships operating on the Europe-Asia and America-Asia routes are Norwegian ships. Recently, seeing the prosperous transportation on the America-Asia Line, the original plan of one ship per month from Shanghai to the United States has been increased to one additional ship starting next month. The new ship Tamerlane has been designated as the first additional ship and is scheduled to depart from Shanghai on June 10th.

Norwegian Ships Resume Service on Europe-Asia Route

The Europe-Asia Line service was suspended after the outbreak of the European War. Now, the Norwegian ship Tricoior is the first to resume service, departing from Shanghai for Europe, stopping at Le Havre, France. It is scheduled to depart from Shanghai for Hong Kong, Singapore, Penang, via South Africa to French Morocco and then to Le Havre this Sunday (the 26th), without passing through the Mediterranean Sea. It is heard that the Norwegian merchant agent has more than one hundred ships, all of which will come to the Far East to participate in the Europe-Asia Line service. The Tongsheng fast ship, represented by Tongyi Shipping Company, is scheduled to depart from Shanghai for Hong Kong, Penang, Singapore, and other ports this week, with cargo transportation being crowded. The Zhini-Canada ship of the Java Company is scheduled to leave Shanghai at 4:00 PM today for Xiamen and Hong Kong, via various ports in Southeast Asia back to Surabaya.

### Coal Balls Fell by Six Yuan Per Ton Yesterday; Retail Prices Have Not Yet Been Reduced

Due to the appreciation of foreign exchange, the price of Shanghai coal has fallen sharply. Yesterday, the price of coal dust remained unchanged, but the price of coal balls fell by another six yuan per ton, bringing it to one hundred and thirty-two yuan per ton, or less than eight yuan per dan (a unit of weight). However, the selling prices in most coal ball retail stores on the market are rarely below eight yuan per dan, except for those selling at a loss. This is quite contrary to the flat-price laws promulgated by the authorities. It is hoped that the coal ball merchants will voluntarily reduce prices.

### President of the British Overseas Chinese Women's Association to Broadcast a Speech Today

Mrs. Nash, President of the American Overseas Chinese Women's Association, is scheduled to deliver a speech on French Radio today.

All large and small packages to Fengxin in the Zhejiang area (except for Nanping and other places), as well as the Ganlu Road and its transit points, and various places in Southern China, will also be suspended. However, small parcels containing personal items and medicines to individuals in the aforementioned areas can still be sent as usual.

### Sino-Western Flower Show Holds a Flower Show at the Shanghai Race Club Clubhouse

### New Shortcut for Europe-Asia Mail Delivery: Hami-Almaty Air Route Connects with Chongqing-Hami and the Soviet Union: Mail to Europe Can Be Sent via This Route

According to postal authorities, the Hami-Almaty air route operated by the Sino-Soviet Aviation Corporation has been officially opened and has begun carrying airmail. Domestically, the route connects with the Chongqing-Hami route and various Sino-European air routes. Internationally, it connects with the Soviet air route. All airmail to the Soviet Union's Asian and European parts, as well as other European countries, can be sent via the Hami-Almaty route. However, senders should indicate "Via Almataa" on the airmail envelope.

### Unprecedented Victory in the Henan-Hubei Campaign: Shanghai Organizations Celebrate Victory and Send a Telegram to Chairman Jiang Reaffirming Their Determination to Support: They Hope to Continue the Effort and Restore the Motherland

Da Guang She reported that all sectors of the city were extremely encouraged by the news of our side's unprecedented victory in the Henan-Hubei campaign. Various industrial and commercial groups in Shanghai sent a special telegram to the central government to congratulate them. The original text of the telegram is as follows: "To Chairman Jiang of the Military Affairs Commission in Chongqing and all the officers and soldiers at the front: Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, for three years now, thanks to your wise command and the courageous efforts of the officers and soldiers, the enemy has sunk deep into the quagmire and is in an inextricable situation. In the recent Henan-Hubei campaign, we have won another unprecedented victory, inspiring the three armies and terrifying the enemy. The end of their road and the day of their destruction are not far away. The good news has spread, and the people are rejoicing. All sectors of Shanghai have a firm determination to support the national policy and have unwavering faith that we will win. We hope to continue the effort and restore our homeland. We respectfully send this telegram in advance to express our anticipation. Shanghai organizations bow."

In addition, the Shanghai General Labor Union sent a special telegram to the central government to celebrate the unprecedented victory in the Henan-Hubei campaign, which made the final victory even more assured. The original telegram is as follows: "To Chairman Jiang, the General Commander: The Henan-Hubei campaign has achieved an unprecedented victory. The Japanese army is fleeing without a trace, with 60,000 captured. The good news has been reported, and the people are rejoicing. The assurance of final victory has been further confirmed. In addition to urging our members to work harder, we send this special telegram to express our congratulations and respect. Shanghai General Labor Union bows."

### German Consulate in Shanghai Pays Attention to Public Opinion, Translates Observations and Intentions from Various Newspapers: German Overseas Chinese in Various Industries Severely Affected

Since Germany's attack on the Netherlands and Belgium and the expansion of the scope of the European war, the German official offices in Shanghai have paid close attention to the public opinion in various countries' newspapers. Important headlines are translated and telegraphed to Berlin. As for trade in the Far East, it has suffered a serious blow. The American and French merchants who used to have dealings with them have now severed trade relations, and future business is quite bleak.

### The Four Banks Allocate 450,000 for Northern Jiangsu and Northern Anhui Relief

Yu Qiaqing initiated the handling of relief in Northern Jiangsu and Northern Anhui, and mortgaged his private property to raise one million yuan to purchase 200,000 bags of imported rice. However, it still felt like a drop in the bucket. He telegraphed Chairman Jiang of the Joint Office of the China, China, Communications, and Agriculture Banks, requesting that they provide a relief fund of 450,000 yuan for Northern Jiangsu and Northern Anhui. The Joint Office of the Four Banks has now received Chairman Jiang's order and telegraphed Yu, stating, "Shanghai Bank relays to Mr. Yu Qiaqing, we have read your telegram about purchasing imported rice to transport to Northern Jiangsu and Northern Anhui to handle relief. The Chairman has telegraphed the Shanghai branch to lend 450,000 yuan. We have telegraphed the reply, please contact us. Yulin General Office, confidential document, printed."

### Two Japanese Warships Berth at the Oujiang Estuary to Monitor Foreign Ships

After the Shanghai-Wenzhou route was frequently obstructed, recently, all ships sailing to Wenzhou have been obstructed and forced to return. Yesterday, it was learned that the Deheunian Shipping Company's Feikang ship was also obstructed outside the port of Wenzhou. The company had not received any telegrams as of last night. It was also learned that there are currently two Japanese warships berthed in the waters off Wenzhou, constantly launching speedboats to patrol the estuary. It is clear that their intention is to monitor the movements of foreign ships.

### Belgian Overseas Chinese Merchants in Shanghai Do Their Best to Donate to Their Motherland

Although the number of people is limited, they eagerly hope for foreign aid. Since Belgian Ambassador Ji Youmu issued a call, all sectors of the city and overseas Chinese in Shanghai have responded enthusiastically, donating large sums of money to cover the medical expenses of the Belgian Red Cross. However, the number of Belgian overseas Chinese in Shanghai is only a little over one hundred. Although they are doing their best to raise funds, their resources are relatively weak. Now, with the enthusiastic assistance of Chinese and foreign merchants, the soldiers at the front have no fear of a shortage of medical supplies and are wholeheartedly fighting. This is not only something that the Belgian government and foreign officials should be grateful for, but also something that the hundred or so overseas Chinese in Shanghai are praising unanimously.

### The French Concession Will Thoroughly Investigate Housing Sub-renting and Establish a Special Department to Manage Rent Matters: Price Labeling of Goods Is Still Mostly Perfunctory and Evasive

According to the English-language "Da Mei Evening News," it has been learned that the French Concession's municipal authorities are determined to control all prices within the concession and will take stern measures to deal with illegal profiteering and the illegal collection of sub-renting when renting out housing. The French Concession Municipal Council's Price Equalization Committee is scheduled to meet on the 23rd. One of the resolutions in its minutes is to establish a special department dedicated to managing rent matters. It is hoped that the staff of the department will be selected on the 23rd, so that it can start working in early June. At that time, the department will thoroughly investigate housing rents and other expenses, first asking landlords and tenants to submit reports, and then comparing and studying the rents before the war and now. It will also conduct a thorough investigation of sub-renting and other matters that have resulted in illegal profits. It is heard that the department will work closely with the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession, and the Price Equalization Committee hopes that within three weeks of the new department's establishment, it will formulate strict measures to deal with the collection of sub-renting and other fees.

Crack Down on the Rice Industry

The Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association received a reply from the Municipal Council yesterday, stating that it deeply hopes that the method of limiting the payment period and delivery period will be effective in cracking down on speculation. It also hopes that any speculation that violates the rules will be reported at any time so that it can be cracked down on. The association immediately announced that the market should comply. The rice and grain trading methods are as follows: From the 10th of this month, regardless of domestic or imported rice (based on a unit of 160 jin), payment must be made with a bill of lading within five days of the transaction date, and the goods must be weighed and shipped within ten days. Imported rice will be paid in full according to the Yinghua book, Hong Kong rice, and domestic rice according to the original quantity on the cost sheet. However, it is feared that there may be insufficient quantity found during weighing, so the seller will deduct two jin per bag and return it to the buyer. Furthermore, to facilitate small imported rice buyers, the industry is notified that transactions of thirty to fifty bags should also be sold. However, if payment is required before weighing, the seller must provide a delivery slip.

Supervise Price Labeling

As foreign exchange appreciates, merchants continue to control prices and mostly refuse to comply with the authorities' price labeling and trading methods. Various civic groups have advised citizens to minimize consumption as much as possible and to not do business with merchants who do not label prices in order to show their resistance. It is understood that since the civic groups issued this advice, a small number of merchants have labeled prices for sales, and some have cut out advertisements and pasted them on the windows to evade responsibility. However, this is far from universal. Currently, all parties hope that the industry associations should urge member merchants to uniformly comply with the authorities' regulations, implement price labeling sales, and reduce prices according to accurate costs to benefit the common people and put industry and commerce on the right track.

Punish Rice Merchants

The Public Concession Municipal Council and the French Concession Municipal Council will begin implementing their legal sanctions against speculative merchants in the middle of next week. It is heard that there are ten rice merchants in the Public Concession who have repeatedly ignored warnings from the Municipal Council for failing to label the prices of their goods. Therefore, the Municipal Council has decided to file a public lawsuit against these twenty people in the middle of next week to punish them as a warning to others. The Municipal Council's Price Control Committee will also send staff to inspect and check the stores within the concession to see if the prices are labeled in full according to the committee's regulations and to review whether the labeled prices are appropriate or inflated. It is claimed that in the past, neighboring stores often labeled different prices on the same goods, with a difference of about ten cents. The Municipal Council has now ordered those who have labeled prices too high to correct them automatically.

### The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Replies to the Municipal Council, Agreeing with Daylight Saving Time: The Post Office Is Likely to Be an Exception

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce received a letter from the Public Concession Municipal Council proposing to hold a "Daylight Saving Time" campaign, advancing the clock by one hour in order to increase working hours and reduce electricity consumption, and requesting their consent. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce immediately replied, expressing its agreement.

Furthermore, it is reported that the Municipal Council plans to implement Daylight Saving Time from June 1st, advancing Shanghai time by one hour. Whether this matter will be implemented will be decided within days. According to a reporter from Da Tong She, most of the public has expressed their approval of this matter. However, it is questionable whether the Shanghai Post Office will take the same approach due to its work arrangements. It is noted that the last time Shanghai implemented a similar Daylight Saving Time campaign, only the Shanghai Post Office did not implement it.

### Postmaster-General Zha Peilin Will Go to the Kunming General Post Office

The Postmaster-General of the Shanghai Postal Administration is planning to travel to the Kunming General Post Office next month to report on the postal situation in the Shanghai postal area and the guerrilla areas such as Nanjing and Hangzhou, and to make requests. He will stay in Yunnan for about four weeks and then return to Shanghai via Haiphong.

### Stabilize the Value of Legal Tender, Maintain the Black Market for Foreign Exchange, Ensure That Fluctuations Are Not Too Drastic, and Prevent Manipulation by Arbitrageurs and Speculators

In addition to fully stabilizing the legal exchange rate, the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee will continue to maintain the black market for foreign exchange in Shanghai for the sake of friendly trade. It has decided to ensure that the external prices do not fluctuate too drastically under the principle of not violating the natural trend of foreign exchange. It will also work with the British HSBC Bank to supply foreign exchange when the black market exchange rate falls sharply to stabilize it. If it rises too much, it will try to absorb it to replenish the fund. At the same time, it will do its best to prevent arbitrage by the Japanese puppets and manipulation by speculators.

Speculation and Opportunism

Since the soaring prices, the average poor common people have been unable to maintain their minimum standard of living. Salaried workers, with their low incomes, also feel that making a living is difficult. Seeing the profits of speculators, who earn ten thousand upon ten thousand, the desire to take a chance arises spontaneously, and they even want to make risky attempts. Therefore, the practice of "scalping" in the market has been quite active recently. Scalping is market jargon for buying goods for immediate sale and then selling them after making a small profit.

Should Awaken Quickly

There are now many people engaged in this practice, like the carp crossing the river. Now, due to the appreciation of the exchange rate, the sharp drop in gold prices, and the fall in the prices of all goods, speculators have learned a great lesson. It is heard that some speculators have gone bankrupt as a result and even committed suicide.

Table Tennis Friendly Match: Peicheng Defeats Soochow; Singles: 5-0, Gan Lanjun Suffers a Crushing Defeat; Doubles: Evenly Matched, Exciting Performances

Cao Jingyuan, the principal of Peicheng Girls' Middle School at 34 Xiaoshadu Road, and Zhu Zhiying, the director of physical education, established a table tennis research class to promote table tennis among female students. They selected the ten most outstanding female students to form a table tennis team and hired Chen Linsheng, a veteran table tennis player, as their instructor. Since then, their skills have improved by leaps and bounds. In the opening demonstration match of the Baolian Cup last Tuesday, they defeated the Baolian Women's Team 6-1 in their first appearance, achieving excellent results and proving to be a rising force among women's teams. Yesterday, the school accepted the challenge of the Soochow Women's University Table Tennis Team for a friendly match in the Peicheng Table Tennis Room, with Ding Du serving as the referee. A total of five singles matches and two doubles matches were played. Peicheng took the lead in one go, winning 5-0. In the last match, Soochow sent out its main player, Gan Lanjun, a former youth team player known for her attacking shots. Unexpectedly, Guo Huichao of Peicheng also showed her skills. Gan attacked while Guo defended, creating a spectacular display. In the third game, Guo attacked with short block shots, which Gan was unable to cope with. As a result, Peicheng won 5-0. In the doubles matches, Soochow sent out a mixed-gender team, which proved to be very strong. In the first match, they encountered fierce resistance, but ultimately relied on Lu Xiangyuan's accurate attacking shots and Luo Qingyu's effective saves to defeat Peicheng's Feng Mingyin and Guo Huichao team 21-17. In the second match, Peicheng sent out the doubles champions Gui Rongzheng and Zhang Lizhi. The two worked well together, coordinating their offense and defense. Although Gan Lanjun of Soochow was paired with the strong player Chen Ning, they were no match for Gui and Zhang's cooperation, and lost 12-21. In conclusion, Peicheng defeated Soochow Women's University by a large margin.

The outcome of this match may determine who wins the finals, so both sides will do their best to win. Qingyun A suffered an unfortunate defeat to Gonghua the day before yesterday and will definitely field its strongest lineup tonight to turn the tide; otherwise, it will have no hope of winning the Zongjing Cup championship and will also have difficulty winning the second or third place. However, the strength of Huayi A should not be underestimated. Players such as Zhang Ying, Fu Qifang, Liu Ziyan, and Ma Tingke are all top players of their time. The match will be intense and exciting, as expected. Referee: Shen Zhu Kuisheng; Location: Liangxi Billiards Room.

Commercial News and Finance: Foreign Exchange Rates Tighten, Prompting Selling

Yesterday's Foreign Exchange Market Conditions

The listed prices for all currencies remained unchanged. In the unofficial market, the British and American exchange rates fluctuated. Operators believed that the unfavorable development of the European war had a negative impact on the market, so bearish sentiment was not eliminated by a temporary increase in foreign demand. In other words, the market was prone to selling when prices tightened. In the morning, the exchange rate fell sharply by 0.01075, leading to a weakening of both the British and American currencies after the opening. Subsequently, heavy selling by speculators bolstered the market, but soon after, Macauley aggressively bought up £100,000 worth of British gold. It was said that this was on behalf of the Equalization Fund, causing sellers to temporarily retreat and the potential for tightening increased. The initial call rate remained at 0.0625, while the American exchange rate was seen at 5.375 yuan. However, Chinese merchants returned to engage in heavy selling, especially in the futures market for the American exchange rate. As a result, the market tightened again at the close. In the end, British gold closed at 4.0625 shillings to the yuan, and the American exchange rate closed at 5.53125 yuan, with the British currency weakening by 0.078125 and the American currency slightly strengthening by 0.03125. The futures and spot markets moved in the same direction.

Macauley's Appetite is Very Strong

In the morning, the London near-term was down 0.0615, the far-term was up 0.0625, and the silver price remained unchanged. The London raw gold price remained fixed. The exchange rate of British currency against the American currency was unchanged, against Shanghai it decreased by 0.015625, and against the French currency it did not change. The American currency decreased against the British currency by 0.01075, against Shanghai it decreased by 0.01, and against the French currency it decreased by 0.000875. The central listed prices for various currencies remained the same. The bank's opening selling price for spot currencies in the morning was 4.09375 shillings per yuan for British gold and 5.40625 yuan for the American exchange rate. Compared with the evening close of the previous day, the British currency weakened by 0.03125 and the American currency strengthened by 0.09375, due to the sharp drop in the exchange rate. After the opening, Chinese merchants generally sold, and the market stabilized and strengthened. At that time, speculators sold May American exchange rates to foreign firms for 5.46875 yuan, and then for 5.53125 yuan, while foreign firms sold spot British gold to Macauley for 4.1875 shillings. HSBC's listed price was unchanged, and the silver balance tax was announced to be lower by 0.005. Later, Macauley's appetite was very strong, absorbing spot British gold at a call rate of 4.15625 shillings. Moreover, due to the scarcity of sellers, the position suddenly felt insufficient, and the situation was very tight. The American exchange rate weakened to 5.375 yuan, and the British exchange rate even reached 4.0625 shillings. However, Chinese merchants sold again when they saw the high price, and the situation soon loosened. It is estimated that speculators sold May American exchange rates to foreign firms for 5.5 yuan, and June American exchange rates for 5.25 to 5.3125 yuan. The noon close was still flat. As a result, British gold closed at 4.140625 shillings and the American exchange rate closed at 5.53125 yuan. This month's British gold was 4.125 shillings and the American exchange rate was 5.5 yuan. June's British gold was 3.96875 shillings and the American exchange rate was 5.25 yuan. Compared with yesterday's closing price, the spot British gold increased by 0.078125, and May and June both strengthened by 0.09375, while the American exchange rate was uniformly weaker by 0.03125 in both the futures and spot markets.

Hong Kong American Exchange Rate Fluctuates Greatly

Hong Kong, 22nd (Wednesday) The exchange market opened steadily this morning, but the American exchange rate fluctuated. The British exchange rate showed no changes in spot or futures markets. The American exchange rate sharply decreased by 0.08125 to 19.625 yuan. The Shanghai exchange rate decreased by 1 yuan to 359 yuan (yesterday afternoon it was 360 yuan). The Japanese exchange rate also tightened by 3 yuan to 83.5 yuan. At 10:00 AM, the American exchange rate slightly loosened by 0.00625 to 19.6875 yuan.

Tianjin British and American Currencies Both Weaken

The spot British exchange rate tightened by 0.00625 to 3.0625 pence, and the spot American exchange rate also weakened by 0.00625 to 4.9375 yuan. The Shanghai exchange rate rose by 2.5 yuan to 114 yuan. The unofficial market for "Joint Currency" was slightly lower by 0.15 yuan.

Foreign Currencies Encounter Another Setback

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw the British and American gold pounds ultimately fall again by two yuan along with the gold price. The supply of British gold notes was also strong, and the price fell by one yuan. The American gold notes were initially flat, but then, due to the general perception that the pound price had fallen sharply by more than a dime and that American stocks had also fallen, indicating unfavorable conditions for the Allied forces, various parties strongly increased their supply. The price once retreated to 17.6 yuan, but then the Equalization Fund resumed its purchase of foreign exchange, so it rose again to 18.4 yuan, but eventually retreated again to 17.7 yuan, a decrease of 0.45 yuan compared to the previous day. In addition, there was also a supply of Hong Kong notes, French francs, Singapore dollars, Annam piastres, and Philippine pesos, and the market prices all weakened. The supply and demand for Japanese yen and Korean won were balanced, and the market prices remained stable. The former remained at 1.08 yuan, and the latter remained at 0.92 yuan.

Exchange Rate for Bills and Discounts Rises

Yesterday, the discount rate for exchange rate bills and notes slightly increased. Throughout the morning and afternoon, the rate was consistently between 115 yuan and 120 yuan per thousand yuan, an increase of two yuan. The interest rate for the Qianye Guild remained unchanged, with both the morning and afternoon markets quoting 0.26 yuan.

Banks Close for Interest Calculation; Staff Members Currently Processing

Mr. Ying Yongyu of the banking sector stated that since the outbreak of the war, the floating deposits of various banks in the city have increased, and the number of current accounts has surged. The interest calculation procedures at each term (June 20th and December) are cumbersome, and there is a real need for a holiday. In addition, banks in Tianjin, Hankou, and Chongqing have already implemented holidays for interest calculation. He has sent a letter to the Banking Association for discussion. At present, colleagues from various banks such as the Bank of China, the Bank of Nanjing, and the Bank of Communications in this city have expressed their support, and it is hoped that this practice will be adopted by the banking industry so that the interest calculation (June 20th) can be implemented.

Gold Market Fluctuates; Briefly Breaks Through the 6,000 Yuan Mark, But Ultimately Falls Again Due to War

Yesterday's unofficial market for cash gold saw an increasingly wide range of fluctuations, the result of competition between new bulls and bears. However, the general sentiment was still influenced by the deteriorating European war situation, leading to a tendency to sell, so the price ultimately fell by 70 yuan. The opening price in the morning was 5,750 yuan, a decrease of 80 yuan from the previous day. Furthermore, due to selling by money exchange businesses and banks, the price fell to a low of 5,660 yuan. Subsequently, the exchange market reported tightening, and buying sentiment suddenly rose, especially with aggressive bidding by new bulls, such as the continued purchase by the Hong Kong gang, which was very strong. In addition, gold shops and banks were also absorbing, and the price briefly broke through the 6,000 yuan mark, reaching a high of 6,030 yuan. However, this was short-lived, and the price soon fell back. At that time, the foreign exchange market weakened, and gold shops, banks, and retail investors continuously sold, and the price was only 5,740 yuan. The closing price was also only 5,760 yuan, a decrease of 70 yuan from the previous day. In the afternoon, there was no trading heard outside the market. The total transaction volume for the half-day was about 3,000 taels. Jewelry stores ultimately quoted a small increase of ten yuan for gold ornaments. Customs gold and other prices remained fixed.

Cash Gold Falls by 70 Yuan

Since the morning, each bar (ten taels) was initially down 80 yuan because the exchange rate had fallen sharply, but the American exchange rate soon reversed and loosened, making it difficult to boost confidence. The opening price was 5,750 yuan, with gold shops trading ten taels. Subsequently, due to the tendency of money exchange businesses to sell and a certain bank's urgent selling, the price fell another 90 yuan. The interbank trading price for ten taels was only 5,660 yuan. Then, the foreign exchange market tightened, and a certain bank was the first to stop selling and aggressively buy, and the price rose again. Soon after, buying sentiment gradually increased, with securities firms and gold shops competing to aggressively buy, and the Hong Kong gang also actively participated. Before long, the price soared past the 6,000 yuan mark, with gold shops buying 30 taels from banks for 6,030 yuan. Unexpectedly, the market suddenly turned at this time, and selling sentiment rose again. Gold shops and banks rushed to sell at the high price, and the exchange market weakened again. Many retail bulls sold when they saw the situation. By the time of the close, the price had fallen back to 5,740 yuan. Later, securities firms sold ten taels to banks, making the noon closing price 5,760 yuan. As a result, the price fell by 70 yuan compared to the previous day, with a range of 370 yuan in half a day. The selling price of this brand of cash gold by gold shops was more than ten yuan higher than the unofficial price, and the buying price was reduced by thirty yuan. The current bid gold price was more than fifty yuan lower than the listed gold price, and there was little trading.

Jewelry Gold Quoted at a Small Increase of Ten Yuan

Initially, the selling price of jewelry gold per tael by the Datonghang was still suspended at 600 yuan. However, at 9:30 AM, it was quoted at a small increase of ten yuan. At the same time, it returned to ten yuan higher at 9:50 AM. At 10:10 AM, it returned to ten yuan lower. At 10:40 AM, it fell back to ten yuan. At 11:45 AM, it was quoted at a small increase of ten yuan. There were no changes after that. As a result, it was quoted at a small increase of ten yuan, with Datonghang changing the suspended price to 590 yuan. The new Datonghang price was the same as the upper price, and the buying price was reduced by about thirty yuan.

Securities: A Gloomy Wednesday for Foreign Stocks Today

Yesterday's securities unofficial market turned bearish again. After falling for two consecutive days, it fell by about one yuan. Initially, there were rumors in the concession, which were nothing more than unfounded fears. In the afternoon, rumors suddenly spread that both the United States and Italy had joined the shame group, and the world would become a furnace, and people's hearts were again uneasy. In fact, there was no problem in the concession, and the United States and Italy joining the war, although expected, had nothing to do with government bonds. There were those who came out as bulls, and those who compensated as bears, each causing confusion. The market should improve today. Yesterday, Jiufeng consistently sold, while Hongkang bought. Yichang consistently bought in both the morning and afternoon. Defu bought more in the afternoon, and there were more sellers. Shunkang, Yitai, Renchang, Houdale, and Maole, especially No. 38, were the most eager to sell, so the market was even weaker in the afternoon, falling by 0.5 to 0.65 yuan compared to the previous day. The total transaction volume was more than 900,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:

Category Highest Lowest Closing Compared to Previous Day

Unified A 59.80 59.40 59.40 Down 0.60

Unified B 51.80 51.15 51.25 Down 0.65

Unified C 50.00 49.40 49.40 Down 0.50

Unified D 48.50 47.80 47.90 Down 0.65

Unified E 49.90 49.55 49.55 Down 0.60

Stock trading: 100 shares of Bank of China were traded at a price of 73 yuan.

Yesterday's public stock market could be named "Gloomy Wednesday." The brokers of the public industry association could not recall a day in their memories that was the same as this scene. The sorrow and desolation can be described as extreme. Stock prices have all become secondary matters, and the only point of anxiety in the public mood is the serious development of the war in northwestern France the day before yesterday. "Giger will be miserably defeated" was the general expectation the night before, and the fact turned out to be the case. At the opening, the public showed extreme indifference to the market. There was much to be said for the actions of the buyers, but the power of the sellers ultimately prevailed, and the closing price was the lowest of the day. Among rubber stocks, the stocks of various Dutch Indian companies suffered a serious blow again. The English-Chinese stock fell from 25.5 to 21 yuan, which is one example.

London, 21st (Tuesday) The listed market prices of Chinese foreign debt remained stable today, and there were no changes in the prices of various bonds.

London, 21st (Tuesday) The listed market prices of British companies in the Far East rose slightly today after consecutive falls in bank stocks. HSBC's London-registered shares rose by half a pound to 78.5 pounds, and Hong Kong-registered shares rose by 1.5 pounds to 81.5 pounds. The rest remained flat.

Shahua: In order to Protect Losses, Flower Shops Sell Futures Yarn; Current Loan Hong Kong Gang Procurement Still Good

The yarn market continues to rise, and the trend is slightly stable. Because the actual demand is not bad, people's hearts have changed to stability. However, the cotton industry situation is still weakening due to the increasingly serious European war. Therefore, flower shops in the current yarn market have successively sold futures to protect losses. As a result, the table is still feeling loose.

The morning opening of the current yarn was due to the rise in gold in the afternoon of the previous day, and the good face was remembered.

In recent years, customs in Shanghai have changed drastically, morals have declined. The Zhou brothers' parricide case has not yet completely concluded, and now another case of a younger brother plotting to murder his elder brother has occurred. Fortunately, the police station discovered it early, allowing it to be solved. The details are recorded below.

Zhuang Renjun, a man from Dacha (大塲),

over thirty years of age, operates the Zhengfeng Herbal Medicine Store at number 419 Hankou Road. His younger brother, Zhuang Debao (22 years old), also works at Zhengfeng, responsible for sales and collecting payments. Recently, Zhuang Renjun discovered that his brother and another salesman, Meng Zhenhua (22 years old) from Nanxiang, had jointly embezzled collected funds amounting to several thousand yuan. He sternly ordered them to find a way to repay the money before the end of the old lunar year's Dragon Boat Festival. Meng and Zhuang Debao, finding it impossible to repay the money at once, conceived an evil plan. Meng then said to Xu Jin, "Your brother disregards brotherly affection and insists on the return of the funds. But you and I both

cannot raise huge sums of money.

The matter will inevitably end badly. It would be better for us to murder your brother. Not only can you avoid being oppressed, but you can also rise to take over your brother's business, so that you and I can enjoy freedom from now on," and other sweet-talking words. Zhuang Debao, upon hearing this, disregarded brotherly affection and readily agreed. Meng then returned to his hometown of Nanxiang and recruited four fellow villagers: Qiang Yunsheng, Sun Baokui, Teng Baozhong, and Chen Rongqian. They came to Shanghai and established a base in room 235 of the Jincheng Hotel at 570 Hankou Road, as a place for Qiang and the others to stay. At the same time, they instructed Qiang and the others to carry out

the assassination of Zhuang Renjun.

After the matter was completed, a reward of 400 yuan would be paid. To gain trust, Zhuang and Meng first paid 150 yuan. They also agreed to take action on the night of the 19th of the month. However, that night, Zhuang Renjun, for some reason, did not return home. Qiang and the others waited for a long time but did not arrive, so they returned empty-handed. As a result, they decided to go again at 10 p.m. on the 21st. But at 7:45 p.m. that afternoon, this secret was suddenly

detected by the Laozha Police Station.

They immediately rushed to room 235 of the Jincheng Hotel and arrested Zhuang, Meng, Qiang, Sun, Teng, and Chen. The 150 yuan reward that Zhuang and Meng had prepaid was also seized at the same time. After being interrogated, they also went to number 27 Xiaohualong (小花) Road, Zhejiang Road, and arrested Meng's lover, Chen Fengzhen (21 years old, a waitress in the Yong'an Rooftop Garden) from Changshu (常熟). Weapons prepared for the assassination were seized, including two pistols and ten bullets. Yesterday, they were all

transferred to the First Special Court,

Criminal Division 1. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi briefly explained what happened. Because this case still needs investigation, he requested a postponement of the hearing. Chief Judge Qian Hongye of the Criminal Division briefly questioned each defendant. Meng Zhenhua fully confessed without hesitation, while Zhuang Debao was evasive. The court then ordered that they be returned to custody together and the hearing be postponed.

breach of trust and embezzlement in the First Special Court. According to their statement, the two defendants, using their positions as chairman of the board and liquidation lawyer, without the consent of all shareholders, arbitrarily sold the entire assets of the factory to the Liming Factory and privately unsealed the factory seal that was kept in the custody of lawyer Peng Xuehai, and signed a

transfer contract with the Liming Factory. According to the contract, the price was 20,000 yuan, but according to a secret informant to the plaintiffs and the board meeting minutes of Liming Factory, Liming Factory spent as much as 38,000 yuan. In addition to 20,000 yuan as the price, the rest was privately embezzled by the two defendants. The plaintiff, Zhu Chunrong, as manager, could not remain silent and, in addition to

refusing to sign, also published a statement declaring his position. The defendants ignored it, so he filed this lawsuit to investigate, etc. The court approved the statement and Judge Jiang Shuzi summoned the two defendants to court for questioning. They denied any breach of trust or embezzlement. The court, considering that the case was clear, announced the end of the debate and scheduled the judgment.

Judge Fei opened the Criminal Division 3 for trial. According to the victims, the defendants Tong Rende and others initially tricked us into working as guides at his Shanghai Light Guide Agency. The money they lent us was all written on receipts to him. Now he is issuing passes and forcing us to follow him to Nanjing to engage in prostitution. We don't agree to go. He took out the loan receipts and asked us for money. There was no way, so we had to obey him. Now we beg the judge to protect us according to the law. The court verified the confessions and briefly questioned the defendants, then ordered them to be remanded in custody and the hearing postponed for seven days. The victims were temporarily handed over to the Women and Children Relief Association for care.

Judge Li has been hearing the case. Because Xi claimed that the money given to Feng was a Jincheng Bank check borrowed from Zhang Binren, who worked at the Ministry of Railways, the court postponed the hearing. The hearing continued yesterday afternoon. The plaintiff was absent due to illness and was represented by lawyers Xu and Lu. The defendants Feng and Xi also arrived in court with their defense lawyers. When questioned, Feng stated that he had obtained more than ten checks from Liang and had returned them all on the due date. Only one check for 500 yuan had not been cleared by the bank. As for the checks for more than 30,000 yuan, he had already given them to Xi Shaofen and had only received a check for 15,000 yuan in the name of Zhang Binren from Xi. At this point, the plaintiff's lawyer Xu stated that it had been discovered that Feng Ruizhang had his own check at the China Reclamation Bank and did not use the plaintiff's check, which showed malicious intent to defraud. After questioning, the court adjourned the hearing to a later date. Xi was released on her original bail, Feng was released on a written guarantee of 15,000 yuan, and was taken into custody due to lack of bail.
