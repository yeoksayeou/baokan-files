### The Japanese Army, Advancing West from Chao-Shan, Suffers a Complete Collapse and Retreats to Anbu. Chinese Forces on the Yong-Qin Road Recapture Numerous Strongholds; Japanese Reinforcements from Xiaodong and Nachen Suffer a Crushing Defeat.

Meixian: The Japanese, advancing west from Chao-Shan in three routes, have been intercepted fiercely by the Chinese army at Aoding Mountain, Datouling, Fugang, Qingma Mountain, Sangpu Mountain, Shaxi, and other places for days on end. Mobile units have also launched fierce assaults on the Japanese flanks and rear. The Japanese have been repeatedly cut off and surrounded by the Chinese forces. By noon on the 12th, the Japanese army suffered a complete collapse, breaking through and retreating towards Anbu. The Chinese army is pursuing on multiple routes, inflicting heavy casualties. The remaining Japanese forces, having retreated to the fortress city, are now heavily surrounded by the Chinese army and are on the verge of complete annihilation. (Dispatch of the 14th)

After the recapture of Daluling by the Chinese forces, the remaining Japanese forces in the vicinity were completely eliminated. It is estimated that over 500 Japanese soldiers were killed. The Japanese army sent over 100 trucks of reinforcements, along with numerous artillery pieces and two aircraft, from Xiaodong. On the morning of the 12th, under artillery and aerial cover, they launched a fierce counterattack against the Chinese forces. The Japanese aircraft even dropped incendiary bombs indiscriminately, setting fire to all the vegetation. The Chinese officers and soldiers were exceptionally enraged and engaged the Japanese in hand-to-hand combat, each man fighting as if he were a hundred. After three hours of intense fighting, over half of the Japanese forces were annihilated. Subsequently, the Japanese continued to reinforce with trucks from Datang. Bloody fighting continued until night. (Dispatch of the 14th)

Chongqing: According to a foreign military observer who recently returned to Chongqing from the Guinan frontlines, the temporary cessation of Sino-Japanese hostilities in the southern Guangdong region is expected to continue for some time. The primary reason is the onset of the rainy season. When he was north of Kunlun Pass, the area had experienced continuous rainfall for four days, and it is expected that even heavier rains will fall soon, making large-scale military operations in the area very difficult.

Chongqing: In the past week, the Japanese have made great efforts to invade Jieyang, suffering heavy losses due to ambushes by various Chinese units. Regarding the Japanese setbacks and the current situation, a military spokesperson told a Central News Agency reporter that the Japanese offensive on Jieyang was launched in two routes, north and south. The northern route advanced from Chaoan along Aogu Lane, launching a fierce attack on Jieyang. The southern route advanced from Anbu along Sangpu Mountain and Xiapu Mountain towards Dagang. Seeing that the Japanese had ventured deep, the Chinese army dispatched surprise troops from all directions to cut off the Japanese rear. After three days and nights of encirclement, the Japanese forces completely collapsed. On the northern route, the Japanese army at Aoding Mountain was subjected to a night attack by the Chinese forces, suffering nearly complete casualties. The remaining Japanese soldiers fled back along the original route. There are no longer any traces of the Japanese army in the vicinity. The Japanese reinforcements attempting to advance west along the Chao-Jie Highway from Guxiang were routed midway by the Chinese forces, scattering in disarray and suffering heavy casualties. On the southern route, the Japanese launched a fierce westward offensive starting on the 7th, but were repeatedly intercepted and annihilated by the Chinese army, suffering over half of their forces. The Japanese forces in the Xiapu Mountain area were surrounded and annihilated by the Chinese army, suffering exceptionally heavy casualties. A portion of the Japanese forces, cut off due to the blocked highway, were surrounded by the Chinese army in the area west of Xiapu Mountain and are being annihilated. (Dispatch of the 14th)

Chongqing: A spokesperson for the Chinese army commented today on the battles in northeastern Guangdong Province, saying that the Japanese attempt to occupy Shantou northwest and Jieyang has failed due to the Chinese recapture of Chenghai, northeast of Shantou. It is reported that after the puppet army led by Huang Dawei occupied Chenghai, the Japanese army transferred a division of troops from the Yangtze River region to fight in the Shantou area, with Jieyang as their destination. On March 7th, the Japanese army launched an attack on Jieyang in two routes, one from Anpu and the other from Renan. The Chinese army defended against the Japanese army attacking from the west while simultaneously dispatching a strong Chinese force to bypass the Japanese flanks and attack their rear, recapturing Chenghai on March 8th. As a result, the Japanese army retreated towards Shantou. (Reuters dispatch of the 14th)

Chongqing: Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, various domestic organizations have sent personnel overseas with numerous titles, lacking coordination, often arousing suspicion among the overseas department and overseas Chinese groups, leading to disputes and numerous abuses. It has been heard that the overseas department, in order to unite spirits and coordinate actions, has sent letters to the Executive Yuan, the Military Affairs Commission, and various organizations, stipulating that in the future, central or local (including Hong Kong and Macau) organizations that send personnel overseas to engage in national salvation work, such as soliciting donations, organizing societies, recruiting personnel, and investigating overseas Chinese affairs, regardless of whether they are party members or not, should personally contact the overseas department or its Hong Kong office first for liaison, in order to notify the local party branches and consulates overseas to provide assistance, prevent villains from taking advantage of the name to confuse the truth, and strengthen the power of resistance.

### Chongqing Newspapers Welcome Soviet-Finnish Peace

Chongqing: The local newspapers all express joy at the establishment of a peace treaty between the Soviet Union and Finland, believing that the Soviet Union's worries in Western Europe have been lifted and that it can turn its attention to the Far East. According to the Xinhua Daily, the newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, the peace between the Soviet Union and Finland is tantamount to the surrender of the imperialists. Imperialist countries have spoken daily of assisting Finland, but in reality, they have only provided a small amount of loans. Their assistance to China already reveals a glimpse of their sacrifice of oppressed nations. Therefore, in the struggle of nations, regardless of domestic or foreign policy, independence is essential. (United Press dispatch of the 14th)

Chongqing: An editorial in the Dagong Bao this morning criticized the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty, saying that the treaty has provided the Soviet Union with a guarantee of security and prevented the spread of the European war. The Soviet Union's entry into Poland, its treaties with the Baltic states, and its decision to conclude a peace treaty with Finland have completed its western defense program. This western border is now safe and free from any possible aggression from Europe. The Soviet-Finnish peace can also prevent the possibility of a direct conflict between the Soviet Union and Britain and France. The Soviet Union now fears not an attack from Britain and France, but an attack from Germany and Japan. However, since Germany is currently reliant on Soviet aid, and regardless of the outcome of the European war, Germany's attack on the Soviet Union after the war is impossible. Therefore, it can be safely inferred that the Soviet Union's relations with Britain and France will not continue to deteriorate (and the Soviet Union can also avoid an attack from Germany). The current position of the Soviet Union has enabled it to turn to the Far East, aiding China in resisting Japan. If the Japanese militarists collapse, the Soviet Union will not only help China but will also eliminate the threat to its eastern border. (Reuters dispatch of the 14th)

### Japanese Prisoners Express Extreme Desire to Naturalize

Chongqing: The reporter visited a prisoner of war camp in a certain place yesterday and saw that the rooms were clean, the equipment was complete, the prisoners were lively, and their lives were comfortable. They shook hands with the reporter and spoke freely, expressing great satisfaction. The remarks of fourteen people, including Oyama Masao, who were recently brought from a certain place, are briefly recorded as follows: (Most of us voluntarily surrendered in a certain place in December last year because those who disrupt the peace of East Asia are the Japanese militarists. In order to save East Asia, we are extremely willing to participate in the movement to overthrow the Japanese militarists. Japan's launch of the war against China has increased the suffering of the Japanese people, consumed Japan's national strength, and brought nothing to the people. Now our families are living in difficult circumstances, our parents, wives, and children are starving and freezing, unable to support them. The national finances have reached a dead end, and there is a lack of manpower in rural areas and factories, resulting in a great shortage of production. The signs of national subjugation are already evident. Therefore, we must join hands with China, work together to restore peace in East Asia, and hope to be naturalized as Chinese people, to work for the peace of China and the East or the Far East.

### The Lessons and Future of the Current World

Here, I would like to offer a third discussion on the affairs of Finland and the Soviet Union, and I especially wish to express my thoughts to the people of Britain, France, America, and the Soviet Union.

Finland's acceptance of the Soviet Union's proposal, abandoning resistance, ceding territory, and making peace, has stirred world public opinion with diverse reactions, with the intensity reaching an extreme. The Soviet Union is smug and content, Finland is grief-stricken and in pain, Germany is rejoicing, Italy is delighted, Sweden and Norway are ashamed, fearful, and joyous, Britain and France regret and seek to improve, and the Americans are regretful, lamenting, and unable to hide their shock. Indeed, because the problem is complex and the impact is far-reaching, the observations differ in their aspects, and the estimations differ in their angles, the feelings and perceptions are necessarily so different. In light of these different perceptions of the same problem, international events should not be measured rashly. Is it not pedantic to measure them by right and wrong? Is it not narrow-minded to measure them by profit and loss? Is it not superficial to measure them by emotion? Is it not narrow-minded to measure them by reality? Is it not helping the violent and flattering the wicked? Is it not obstructive and slow, and of no benefit to the overall situation, to measure them by lofty and outstanding ideals? To insist on one of these and measure by it will create its own discourse, but how can it be a definitive conclusion!

Regarding Finland and the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union has launched both diplomatic and military offensives against Finland since last autumn. What is the nature of this, and what is its intention? When it gradually gained favorable timing and gradually controlled geographical advantages in the war, it then opened up a path of negotiation and sought peace. Although what it took from Finland was very substantial, according to Swedish Foreign Minister Gunther, the terms of the compromise were milder than those initially conveyed by Sweden. This means that the Soviet Union still left room for Finland to maneuver during the negotiations, and the question of whether to comply or resist was for the Finnish government authorities to consider and choose as an independent and free country. The initial nature and intention have received little forgiveness from world opinion, and the final initiative and turnaround can also be criticized. However, supposing the Soviet Union had not done this and had decided to destroy Finland and intended to expand the European war, what would the consequences of this supposition be? There is absolutely no objective fact to serve as the premise for the argument of the supposition, and there is no way to draw a conclusion but much to think about deeply. In this situation, I believe that countries should make two judgments about the Soviet Union: first, that the signing of the peace treaty by the legitimate government of Finland should be recognized in law and in fact as a success for the Soviet Union; and second, that the Soviet Union's turnaround in its attitude towards Finland should be recognized psychologically and practically as the Soviet Union's willingness to compromise. Such a judgment may be an important factor in planning to stabilize the international situation.

The anguish and grievances of the Finnish government in signing the peace treaty will certainly be met with universal sympathy. And its loyal and brave resistance for over a hundred days has ended under these tragic conditions. Not only is it a case of "not the fault of war," but it has also, through glorious war achievements, preserved the independence and freedom of the nation. From the beginning, if it had not resisted, it would inevitably have been politically reduced to a vassal of the Soviet Union; if it had resisted and been utterly defeated, it would have been fundamentally destroyed, as the examples of Czechoslovakia and Poland show. If we set aside the cases of Czechoslovakia and Poland and take the highest example, comparing it with China, Finland is very different from China. The various objective conditions and inherent conditions of the Finnish nation make it impossible for it to resist the Soviet Union and achieve victory on its own. Therefore, China has this confidence and fights, while Finland would be acting recklessly to do so. This is one difference. China expects spiritual and material assistance from friendly nations, and although the assistance received is regrettably small, it has already contributed to the resistance. Finland, in addition to spiritual and material assistance, also hopes for military and manpower support, but this is like a drop in the bucket, too slow to be of any help. This is a second difference. Japan's ambition towards China is to swallow it whole, and its situation is akin to a snake swallowing an elephant. The Soviet Union's peace with Finland proves that its ambition is not to swallow it, and this cannot be used as proof. Its situation is akin to an elephant swallowing a snake. The differences do not stop there, but even with these three points, those who support China's resistance understand the Finnish abandonment of resistance and the painful cession of territory and the making of peace. Those in world opinion who regret the abandonment of Finland's resistance are no different from those who watch a fire from across the river. Those in world opinion who say that Finland has since fallen into the hands of the Soviet Union must look at how the Soviet Union will implement its policies, how Finland will conduct itself, and how Finland's environment and the evolution of the world situation will develop. To hastily regard Finland today as having lost its independence and freedom is either malicious or a neurotic pessimism, not a definitive argument.

The ending of one of the three major events of the day with the cessation of hostilities and the making of peace by Finland and the Soviet Union is, from a local point of view, a move from motion to stillness, from abnormality to normality. However, the impact it has will certainly be seen as a powerful impetus to the global situation. It is still difficult to predict which way the global situation will develop after this impetus. It may even develop in multiple directions simultaneously, even in surprising, frightening, or joyous ways, but in any case, it is definitely not an anomaly. We do not need to assume any particular direction of development and try to discuss it here, but if we take some lessons from the Finnish-Soviet problem and place them in the present, engraving them in our hearts, we firmly believe that it will definitely be helpful in dealing with the developing global situation. What are the lessons? The most noteworthy among them are: (1) The League of Nations is useless without reorganization and replenishment. At the beginning of the Finnish dispute, the League of Nations gathered to deal with it. Although China abstained, dozens of countries voted to expel the Soviet Union from membership and to assist Finland in resisting. But what harm did this do to the Soviet Union, and what benefit did it bring to Finland? The League of Nations has only exposed itself as needing to be reorganized and replenished. (2) The prestige of Britain, France, and America, although undiminished in essence and strong in self-confidence, has fallen sharply in objective evaluation. Therefore, what Britain, France, and America want to repel has failed to stop people. To make people stop, they must take a few steps forward themselves. (3) To provide assistance, one must look at the need, one must be proportionate, and one must be timely. If blood is needed but iron is given, if iron is needed but wheat is given, if wheat is needed but banknotes are given, it is not useless, but it is not effective. If one hundred is needed but ninety-nine is given, it will also be a failure. If it is needed today but promised for the future, it will be of little use for mourning. (4) Spiritual and material aspects cannot be separated. In terms of the spiritual aspect, whether domestic or international, can Finland have any regrets, yet it ultimately had to submit to material forces and sacrifice material things? Yesterday's commentators said that Finland's not fighting affects the spirit of Britain and France more than it affects material things. This is either very thoughtless or a deceitful statement. It is fortunate that Finland did not perish. If it had perished, even with a little luck, its national spirit would have been enough to adorn eternity. Who can deny it, but what good would it do? (5) In wartime, only military means can promote diplomacy. Diplomacy cannot make up for the inadequacy of military means. Those who believe in diplomacy and rely on diplomacy will fail at least in the diplomatic sphere. Britain and France have no regrets about their diplomacy with Finland, but because they lack military strength, diplomacy is useless. In the case of Sweden and Norway, diplomatic failure has hindered military means. (6) The investment and assistance of Britain and France in Czechoslovakia and Poland have, at least for the time being, been reduced to nothing. However, the claims on Finland still exist, and the rights and interests in China still exist. This is because of the power of resistance. Poland was defeated and the situation in Eastern Europe changed. Finland submitted and the situation in Northern Europe changed. Only the precarious situation in East Asia can still be sustained. This is because of the power of resistance. China will never deny the benefits of American, Soviet, British, and French assistance to the resistance, but based on the facts and lessons, it must be recognized that this is not the effect of these countries' assistance to China, but the merit of China's resistance to Japan. If the resister does not resist, the assistance is in vain. If the resister is ultimately defeated, the assistance will be lost.

I hope that the people of Britain and France will think deeply about these lessons. I hope that the people of America will think deeply about them. The Soviet Union is China's best friend. Please let them think more deeply about the Far East based on their own experiences. How should we deal with the unresolved problems of the world? I especially hope that people of all countries will think deeply about the fact that the way to stabilize the international situation is through various principles that are either proposed or recognized by all parties. Today, deviations from these principles are coming one after another. And those who are defeated, those who perish, and those who submit, after years have passed, those who have reaped benefits from deviating from these principles will have managed and digested what they have gained. Fortunately, China in the Far East still has a strong resistance. Otherwise, after a few more years, even if the principles eventually triumph, what kind of situation would the world be in? If we do not make every effort to coordinate and deal with these problems now, but wait until the years pass and we must revive the dead one by one, what is the calculation?

### British Indian Affairs Minister Shot by Indian, Prominent Indian Government Official Vaudoyer Dies, Perpetrator Mohan Singh Arrested on the Spot, Motive Seemed to Be Resistance to Oppressive Policies

London – Last night, the Indian Association held a meeting in Caxton Hall, London. Suddenly, an Indian man fatally shot Sir Michael O'Dwyer, former Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab, and wounded Sir Seton, the Minister of Indian Affairs, Sir Dane, former Governor of the Punjab, and Lord Lamington, former Governor of Bombay. Dane's arm was severed, and Seton was grazed by a bullet and fell beside the chairman's seat. The well-known Middle East authority Sykes was beside him but was unharmed. O'Dwyer, however, was shot in the chest, fell to the ground, and bled profusely. Order was immediately disrupted, and police cordoned off the meeting hall. Approximately 450 people were not allowed to leave or make telephone calls. The police recorded statements from everyone, which took two and a half hours. After being admitted to the hospital, Minister of Indian Affairs Seton found a bullet in his clothing. Seton told reporters that he heard a gunshot and felt a pain in his side before falling to the ground, followed by several more gunshots. The perpetrator was a short, stocky Indian man with a dark complexion. He squeezed to the press seats and fired four shots in a row. He then held the gun high and shouted, "Get out!" He fled from the crowd, but two people jumped up to hold him down. The police then escorted him to a police car and drove him to the police station. Shortly after, officials issued information stating that an Indian man named Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, 37, was charged with the murder of O'Dwyer and the attempted murder of Seton, Lamington, and Dane, and would be tried in criminal court today. After the tragedy, Sykes told a Reuters reporter, "I was lecturing on the situation in Afghanistan at the meeting, which was attended by about 400 people, with about 50 more standing on the sides. As the meeting was adjourned and I was saying goodbye to Seton, I suddenly heard several gunshots and then saw O'Dwyer fall to the ground. I chased after the perpetrator and saw a woman named Miss Herring bravely step forward to stop the perpetrator, even though he had a firearm. The perpetrator eventually pushed Miss Herring aside. Fortunately, an Englishman named Lees tackled the perpetrator from behind, and Indian police officer Captain Pendergast also stepped forward to assist, pinning the perpetrator to the ground. Lees handed me the perpetrator's gun, and after a brief look, I saw that it was a large military handgun, and it had probably fired five shots, but I did not disassemble it and handed it over to the police. I returned to check on O'Dwyer and he had died. Sir Dane was wounded in the arm, and Lord Lamington was wounded in the hand. Seton was knocked down but his injuries were very minor. There was no panic in the hall, and everyone behaved very well. In my opinion, the perpetrator was a sturdy Asian man, about 40 years old. He seemed to be chewing on some kind of pill in the hall, and people were paying attention to him because they didn't know who he was. Before the shooting, he put his hand in his vest, where the gun was hidden." (Reuters dispatch, 14th)

London – "Scotland Yard" (British National Criminal Investigation Department) recently issued a bulletin stating, "The East India Association and the Royal Central Asian Society held a joint meeting today, chaired by Major General Sir Sykes. Prominent Indian government official Sir Michael O'Dwyer, Minister of Indian Affairs Lord Seton, Sir Donald, and Lord Lamington all attended. As the meeting ended, a single assailant fired six shots in a row. Sir Michael O'Dwyer died on the spot, and three others were injured. The perpetrator fled into the crowd, but the police have arrested a suspect and scheduled him for interrogation tomorrow morning." According to general observations, this case clearly has political implications, as Sir Michael O'Dwyer served as Governor of the Punjab in India. During his tenure, the region was troubled, with repeated riots. British military commander General Dyer suppressed them severely, while Sir Michael O'Dwyer defended him, thus incurring much criticism. Furthermore, he did not support the concept of a pan-Indian federation and was strongly opposed to Gandhi's activities. (Havas dispatch, 13th)

London – Prime Minister Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons today regarding the Caxton Hall shooting incident, "We express our deepest sympathy to Lady O'Dwyer and her family for their tragic loss, and we wish all those injured a speedy recovery. As far as he knows, the injuries are not serious and the progress is good." Chamberlain continued to describe the incident and announced the perpetrator's name as Mohan Singh. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)

New Delhi – At today's meeting of the Council of States, the opposition leader proposed a resolution condemning the assassination of former Punjab Lieutenant-Governor Sir Michael O'Dwyer and requesting the chairman to express deep condolences to Lord Seton, the British Secretary of State for India. Leaders and members of other parties also seconded the motion. The Punjab Legislative Council in Lahore also passed a resolution today condemning the Caxton Hall attack. Mr. Lal, a representative of the Congress Party, stated that any action that violates the Congress Party's creed of nonviolence is not acceptable to the Congress Party, but the Congress Party will not participate in this resolution.

### Japanese Navy Unwilling to Open the Yangtze River, Citing Third-Country Aid to China

Tokyo – A spokesman for the Japanese Naval Ministry stated today that third-country aid to the National Government would delay the opening of the Yangtze River, as this aid would enhance Chinese military strength and hinder Japan's efforts to clear the Yangtze River. The spokesman cited the U.S. loan of $20 million to China as evidence of second-country aid to China. He stated that the U.S. demands that Japan reopen the Yangtze River, but at the same time aids Japan's enemy, which is incomprehensible. (United Press dispatch, 14th)

### Gandhi Urges Indians to Wait for the Right Moment, Not to Trouble Britain for the Time Being

Calcutta – According to reliable sources here today, Indian national movement leader Gandhi has asked the All India Congress, which is currently meeting in Ramgarh, not to trouble Britain while it is preoccupied with events in Western Europe, and to wait for the right moment before raising the demand for national self-determination. However, some believe that the conclusion of the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty will influence the decision of the All India Congress, as the uncompromising faction led by Bose will use the reason that the Soviet Union no longer threatens Britain to seek the realization of Indian national demands. Meanwhile, Gandhi also arrived here this morning. As his car drove to the All India Congress, there were thousands of welcomers along the way. (United Press dispatch, 14th)

### Singapore Port Authority Strike Incident, MacDonald Responds to Questions in the House of Commons

London – During last night's meeting of the House of Commons, Labor MP Jones asked what steps the government has taken to improve the conditions of Singapore port workers and whether there were actions to evict skilled workers from their homes. Colonial Secretary MacDonald replied that he was instructing Governor Thomson to provide information on the current situation in the area. MacDonald also responded to Jones's supplementary question, saying that he was not certain whether there were any evictions from their homes, and that he would take appropriate action when he received the report. Labor MP and Mr. Wilson asked whether it was strange that labor unrest had occurred in almost all colonies since MacDonald took office as Colonial Secretary. MacDonald did not answer this question.

### British Loan to China Negotiations in Progress, Butler Answers Questions from Members of the House of Commons

London – During this afternoon's meeting of the House of Commons, opposition Liberal MP Roper raised questions on the issue of aid to China, stating that the U.S. Federal Export-Import Bank had recently granted a line of credit of $20 million to China, and that Britain also had an obligation to aid China in accordance with the resolutions passed by the League of Nations General Assembly. He asked whether the government was prepared to take appropriate measures to provide similar assistance to China. Foreign Office Under-Secretary Butler immediately replied that China and Britain were seemingly in negotiations regarding this matter, and that the British government was fully aware of the obligations stipulated by the League of Nations resolutions and would do its best to fulfill them under the current difficult circumstances. (Havas dispatch, 13th)

### The Minai Declaration Is Not Worth Taking Seriously, London Comments

London – Regarding Japanese Prime Minister Minai's statement yesterday that Japan wants to respect China's independence and freedom, although newspapers have not yet commented, Reuters has learned that officials and Far East experts here believe that this statement has nothing new and does not mention the issues that other countries want to hear. Minai's statement did not mention the conditions Japan is giving to Wang Jingwei, nor did he reiterate Konoe's guarantee that Japan would not demand territory or reparations, nor did he clarify the exact nature of Japan's "New Order in East Asia." Although Tokyo newspapers have repeatedly discussed the meaning of the "New Order," they have never clearly explained it. Britain and the United States have already stated to Japan regarding the proposed Wang government that the two countries will abide by the resolutions of the Nine-Power Treaty and are unlikely to change their attitude. Chinese people here sneered at Minai's remarks and said that Wang Jingwei could not recruit any reputable figures. If Japan wants to continue its war in China, then China is prepared to wait and has no doubts about the outcome of the war. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)

### Japanese Shipping Plans to Expand

Tokyo – Before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the tonnage of Japanese ships was only 4.5 million tons. Now, an expansion plan has been drawn up, with the goal of increasing it to 7.5 million tons by the end of 1942. Various shipping companies have also been recruiting a large number of sailors to meet the demand. According to statistics published in local newspapers, Japanese shipyards built a total of 50,000 tons of merchant ships last year, which requires approximately 6,000 sailors. However, due to the war, many workers have been absorbed by the military-related industries, and only 4,000 people have been hired as a result of the recruitment. But after the recent implementation of the Seamen's Insurance Law, this situation has changed. The 20 seamen's referral agencies plan to recruit 8,000 sailors this year. There is a continuous stream of applicants. Taking Tokyo as an example, the goal is to recruit 800 sailors, cooks, stewards, and firemen, but there have already been 1,500 applicants, which shows the enthusiasm. (Havas dispatch, 13th)

### Annam Returns Mail on Japanese Ship

Osaka – The Osaka Shosen's "Saigon Maru," which had all its mail seized by Annam naval authorities in Saigon on the 12th, telegraphed the Osaka Shosen head office on the afternoon of the 14th, stating that all mail, except for a few small packages containing prohibited items, had been returned.

### Finnish President Broadcasts Decision to Devote Efforts to Reconstruction, Rumors of a Provisional Government to Approve the Treaty, People of the Ceded Territories Prepare to Move to New Areas

Helsinki – The Finnish President broadcast to the nation, expressing admiration for the army and gratitude for the people's bravery in the war, and stating that Finland must now devote itself to reconstruction. He also expressed confidence in Finland's future because its freedom remains intact and its army is ready to protect the country's existence at any time. It is now estimated that as a result of the war and the treaty, 400,000 Finnish civilians have lost their homes and property. Furthermore, according to General Mannerheim, Commander-in-Chief of the Finnish Army, the Soviet Army suffered 200,000 casualties in the war, and lost 1,500 tanks and 700 aircraft. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)

Stockholm – The Finnish delegation arrived here by special plane from Moscow at 7:30 p.m. today. The plane returned to its country at 9:00 p.m. (Havas dispatch, 13th)

Helsinki – Finnish Prime Minister Ryti and other members of the Finnish delegation arrived here by plane this morning. All Finnish cabinet members, except for those who resigned, greeted them at the airport. It is unknown when the Diet will approve the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty, but the Diet will convene a meeting tomorrow. It is said that approval of the treaty requires a five-sixths majority vote in the Diet. (Haitong Agency dispatch, 14th)

Copenhagen – According to news here today, the Finnish government will probably resign in its entirety and establish a provisional government to approve the peace treaty with the Soviet Union and resume relations with the Soviet Union. This move would allow those who advocate resisting the Soviet Union to avoid signing a humiliating peace treaty with the Soviet Union. (United Press dispatch, 14th)

Helsinki – Because the severity of the war situation has become increasingly clear, it is obvious that Finland has no other option but to make peace. Soviet troops have penetrated deep into southern Finland across the ice, forcing the coastal batteries east of Helsinki to open fire. It is reported that Finnish Prime Minister Ryti obtained guarantees from his parliamentary colleagues before going to Moscow, so there is no doubt that the country will approve the treaty. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)

Helsinki – Political figures here say that although the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty has been concluded, relations between the two countries remain tense. In addition, after the Soviet Union establishes a naval base on Finland's Hanko Peninsula, the two countries may have new disputes at any time. Sweden and Norway refuse to allow British and French troops to pass through their territory to Finland, so Finland's relations with those countries may not be good in the future. Foreign observers say that since a corner of Northern Europe will not become a battlefield, the Soviet Union can free up 40 army divisions and 2,000 aircraft for use in future operations. (Havas dispatch, 13th)

Helsinki – After the conclusion of the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty, people across the country expressed regret and dissatisfaction with the Scandinavian countries, blaming them for bearing responsibility. The radio address given by Danish Foreign Minister stated that foreign aid was insufficient and Finland's situation was dire, which was surprising to general public opinion because it was unexpected. (Havas dispatch, 11th)

Helsinki – It has recently been announced here that the land ceded by Finland to the Soviet Union has 150,000 Finnish residents. The government is currently drafting plans and raising funds to move them to the new border. (Haitong dispatch, 14th)

Moscow – Moscow Radio reported that the entire Soviet Union is holding grand demonstrations to celebrate the conclusion of the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty. The speeches stated that although the Soviet Union has acquired territory in the northwest after the successful conclusion of the war, it does not deny Finland's independent existence. (Haitong dispatch, 14th)

Stockholm – According to a Moscow correspondent for Aftonbladet, the Soviet Union plans to establish the Karelia Republic in the territory ceded by Finland, with Vytegra as its capital. Important government positions will be given to Finnish communists currently residing in the Soviet Union. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)

Finnish Government's Proclamation to the People

Helsinki – The Finnish government issued a proclamation to the people last night, stating that a ceasefire will take effect today after the signing of the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty. Finland has been at war with a strong enemy since November 30 last year, for three and a half months. Countless soldiers have sacrificed themselves for the country, and the nation will forever admire them. Finland has decided to make peace, believing that peace can avoid even greater dangers. Finland's heroic soldiers and steadfast people, prepared to make the greatest sacrifices, have maintained their freedom and honor. The European war is not yet over, but we have restored peace. Remember our sacrifices and rebuild our country. The government will consider caring for the families of fallen soldiers as its responsibility and honor, and the people's work and bread as the government's most important duties. Compatriots residing in the ceded areas, and compatriots whose homes have been destroyed by the war, will be given new homes. All of these things require the greatest effort. Recent developments in recent hours have given us hope that we will become more united in times of crisis. At this critical moment, only mutual assistance and cooperation can lead to a bright future. (Haitong dispatch, 14th)

Finnish Commander-in-Chief's Message to the Troops

Helsinki – General Mannerheim, Commander-in-Chief of the Finnish Army, Navy, and Air Force, issued a message to the troops yesterday, stating that the Finnish army sacrificed more than 15,000 soldiers in glorious battles. Although the Soviet army currently controls most of the battlefield, the Finnish army's achievements have unfolded a glorious page in world history. The Finnish soldiers' perseverance and sense of responsibility have accomplished difficult tasks, eliminating a huge number of enemy troops, shooting down more than 700 aircraft, and destroying more than 1,500 tanks. Women's groups also participated in wartime service, and workers risked bombing to take on wartime relief work, which is commendable. However, although the Finnish army can sacrifice heroically, Finland has not adequately prepared to fight against a powerful country, and the Finnish government has to accept harsh peace terms. The Finnish army resisted for sixteen weeks, holding an incomplete defense line and awaiting the assistance they expected, which failed to materialize. Only two battalions of volunteers participated in the fighting. However, if Sweden and Western European countries had not provided material assistance, the Finnish army would not have been able to fight for so long. The Finnish army has not collapsed, but the number of enemy troops continues to increase, and the Finnish army has had to retreat completely. The Finnish army is well aware that it bears the responsibility of safeguarding Western civilization in Eastern Europe and will continue to fight bravely to defend the motherland in the future. (Haitong dispatch, 14th)

### Finland Suggests a Defense Alliance to Sweden and Norway, Both Countries Express Willingness to Discuss, Swedish Foreign Minister Speaks to Aid Finland's Reconstruction

Helsinki – Finnish Foreign Minister Tanner told reporters last night that before the Finnish delegation went to Moscow, Sweden, Norway, and Finland had agreed to hold talks aimed at guaranteeing the borders of the two countries. These talks were initiated by Finland and will continue for several days. Tanner also said that Finland has not been pressured by Western powers before or during the war, and the peace was decided solely by the Finnish government. Germany did not participate in the mediation. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)

Stockholm – According to reliable sources here today, Sweden is now planning to form a defense alliance of a mutual assistance nature with Finland and Norway, (1) to protect Finland's new borderlines and to enhance the position of Sweden and Finland in the Baltic Sea, and to support Norway's neutral territorial waters rights. It is reported that this plan was submitted to the Finnish side by Sweden at the same time as the Soviet Union's peace terms were handed over. The Soviet Union also approved this plan in advance, stating that as long as it does not conflict with the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty, the Soviet Union will not object. (United Press dispatch, 14th)

Stockholm – The Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying that the Swedish government, in reply to the Finnish government's inquiry, has stated that it is prepared to examine the possibility of Norway, Sweden, and Finland concluding a defensive alliance. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)

Stockholm – It is not yet certain whether the talks on a joint Swedish-Norwegian guarantee of borders have indeed begun. The Swedish Foreign Ministry told a Reuters reporter today that, as far as they knew, the Norwegian government had agreed to consider the matter. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)

Oslo – Norwegian Foreign Minister Koht declared today that the Finnish government had asked Norway, Finland, and Sweden two days ago about the possibility of establishing a defense alliance, and the Norwegian government had replied that it was prepared to consider it. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)

Oslo – A Norwegian newspaper reported that although the terms of the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty are harsh, Norwegians welcome the signing of peace as a relief. The newspaper emphasized that it is now even more necessary than before to increase aid to Finland. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)

Stockholm – Foreign Minister Günther gave a radio address this evening, stating, "According to unofficial news, the Soviet Union and Finland have concluded a peace treaty. Although the Swedish nation is extremely saddened after hearing the contents of this treaty, it is still full of admiration for Finland's actions. As for the position of the countries on our role in this peace conference, there are many misunderstandings. In fact, we are only intermediaries. In short, Finland could not help but consider the peace conditions proposed by the Soviet Union, and it was not under pressure from any party. Fortunately, as a result of the negotiations between the two sides, the conditions accepted by Finland are different from those we relayed, which is somewhat gratifying. It is expected that the countries that failed to provide more assistance to Finland in accordance with the promises made last December were disappointed, but in fact, the country did not have any hope of winning. At this time, we should do our best to assist it, and never make any request in return. Our volunteers' sacrifices for that country will always be remembered. At this point, the most urgent thing for us is to assist its reconstruction. Do not think that the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty will be completed and we can rest easy. It is necessary to know that the current crisis still exists. After the change in the Finnish border, the general situation will become more delicate. Therefore, we must prepare to deal with unexpected events and should use Finland as a lesson." (Havas dispatch, 13th)

### Fate of Northern European Countries Bleak, British Military Experts Observe

London – According to military observers here today, from now on the entire Scandinavian Peninsula and Finland are under the shadow of Soviet military force. Even if Finland and Norway establish a Nordic Three-Country Defense Agreement, it cannot offset the strategic advantages given to the Soviet Union by the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty. In this treaty, Finland's defense forces have been invisibly restricted. At the same time, the Soviet Union's tentacles have spread to the entire peninsula. For example, the cession of Karelia has destroyed Finland's Mannerheim Line. This line is located in the most defensible location of Finland's natural environment, but after this location, there is no terrain that can build a line as strong as the Karelia Mannerheim Line. Therefore, from now on, national defense has lost its strongest barrier. Furthermore, after the Soviet Union has acquired bases on the Hanko Peninsula and the mainland, it has seized the most important heartland of southern Finland. Finland's granting of a railway to the Soviet Union in the mountainous region of its waist has opened a gateway for the Soviet Union to enter the Gulf of Bothnia, connecting it with Sweden, and further north to Petsamo. In addition to restricting Finland's naval power, it is necessary to allow the Soviet Union to enter and exit northern Norwegian cities. Therefore, from now on, not only will it be difficult for Finland to resist the Soviet Union again, but Sweden and Norway will also be threatened. (United Press dispatch, 14th)

### Anguish in Helsinki: Funeral March Broadcast, Air Raid Precautions Not Lifted

### US Decides to Continue Aiding Finland, Assisting with Reconstruction; Roosevelt Condemns Soviet-Finnish Treaty, May Revise Foreign Policy

Washington: President Roosevelt last night vehemently condemned the Soviet-Finnish peace terms. He stated, "This war has not clarified the inherent rights of small nations to maintain their integrity against attacks by powerful nations. The Finnish people, with superhuman courage and steadfast resistance, have matched their strength against superior forces. They have earned the permanent peace and independent sovereignty of their nation. The Finnish people and government have increased the respect and fervent concern of the American people and government for Finland. The United States firmly believes that superior military force compelled Finland to accept peace." The President's statement indicates that the United States may eventually recognize the Soviet gains, as the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty contains formal diplomatic elements. It is generally recalled that the United States did not recognize Italy's conquest of Abyssinia and Albania, Germany's occupation of Czechoslovakia, Austria, Poland, Danzig, and Memel, or the Soviet Union's seizure of eastern Poland. At the same time, Secretary of State Hull indicated that he would soon issue a statement regarding the Finnish peace. It is widely believed that the State Department will be forced to revise its diplomatic policy to address the new European issues. Observers generally feel that the policy of moral embargo on arms to the Soviet Union will need to be reconsidered. Jesse Jones, Chairman of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, stated that the remaining portion of the US$10 million credit recently extended to Finland by the Export-Import Bank will be used for postwar reconstruction and refugee relief work. Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stated, "The Soviet-Finnish peace is unrelated to us." Some members of Congress view the Soviet-Finnish peace as a victory for Hitler. (United Press dispatch, 14th)

New York: Finnish President Kallio yesterday telegraphed former US President Hoover, stating that Finland had "signed forced peace terms." He requested Hoover to continue his efforts in the United States to alleviate the difficulties of the Finnish people. Hoover replied, stating that he would do his utmost to assist Finland. (United Press dispatch, 14th)

Washington: Diplomatic circles state that the US government, at the beginning of the Soviet-Finnish war, imposed a "moral embargo" on the Soviet Union. Although the two countries have now established a peace treaty, the embargo should be maintained, at least until the United States clarifies its attitude toward various small countries, before further consideration. The US Federal Export-Import Bank's previously decided credit line of US$20 million to Finland will not be cancelled, so that the country can use it for reconstruction work. (Havas dispatch, 14th)

### Soviet-Finnish Armistice: No Loss to Britain and France; Germany Claims Allied Failure; London Does Not Acknowledge

London: Reuters diplomatic correspondent reports that well-informed circles in London are taking a broad view of the end of the Soviet-Finnish war and do not acknowledge the claim made by Germany and pro-German newspapers that this represents a failure on the part of the Allies. It is true that small countries are forced by circumstances to accept the demands of powerful neighbors, and that the principle of solidarity among small countries has suffered a blow as a result. However, in practical terms, the Allies have suffered no loss. Although the Allies had made arrangements to send troops to aid Finland, the governments of Norway and Sweden expressed their disagreement, and Finland did not issue a direct appeal, resulting in the failure of the Allied troop deployment plan. The result was very unfavorable to Finland, but the Allies did not suffer any losses. Furthermore, the various military supplies that the Allies were constantly supplying to Finland can now be retained for their own use. Now that the Soviet Union no longer needs to devote its strength to a war of attrition, it can provide more economic assistance to Germany. However, the Soviet Union suffered significant losses in the war against Finland, and it will take time to recover, leaving no spare capacity to attend to other matters. Furthermore, there is no mutual assistance pact between the Soviet Union and Germany; all that exists is a non-aggression treaty. Although Germany hopes to obtain more supplies of oil, food, and raw materials from the Soviet Union, those familiar with the situation in Moscow are certain that the Soviet Union is primarily concerned with its own interests, not those of Germany. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)

### Soviet Citizens Hold Meetings in Various Cities; Support Soviet-Finnish Peace Treaty

Moscow: Soviet citizens unanimously expressed their approval and welcome for the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty. Mass rallies were held in major cities such as Moscow and Leningrad, expressing enthusiastic support for the Soviet government's wise policy of safeguarding border security. (TASS dispatch, 14th)

### Final Battle Reports from Soviet and Finnish Sides

Moscow: A communiqué from the headquarters of the Leningrad Military District stated that after two hours of intense fighting, Soviet troops occupied Viipuri at 7:00 AM yesterday. As of 12:00 PM, there were no other significant developments elsewhere. According to the treaty signed on the 12th, all hostilities ceased at noon yesterday. (TASS dispatch, 14th)

Helsinki: The last Finnish war bulletin announced that Finnish troops continued their counter-offensive in Karelia until the ceasefire time. All Soviet attacks on all fronts were repelled. Four Soviet aircraft were shot down and fifteen tanks were destroyed on the final day of fighting. In the past few days, a total of sixty Soviet tanks were destroyed on the ice of Viipuri Bay. Soviet aircraft bombed Rovaniemi and Kemi. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)

### Danish Newspaper Reports News from Helsinki: Kuusinen Executed

Copenhagen: According to news from Helsinki carried by this newspaper, Otto Kuusinen, the head of the Finnish puppet government established in Terijoki at the beginning of the Soviet-Finnish war, has been executed. Kuusinen was reportedly executed for supplying the Soviet government with incorrect information about the situation in Finland before the war. Stalin was reportedly enraged by Kuusinen's advice to launch an adventurous action against Finland to save the Finnish people from Mannerheim's control, as the outcome was contrary to his judgment. He personally ordered Kuusinen's execution. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)

### Welles Flies Back to Paris; To Meet with Daladier; Met with Lloyd George and Others Before Leaving England; Rumor of British Hope for US-Brokered Peace

Paris: US Undersecretary of State Welles, when calling on Prime Minister Daladier this afternoon, presented a letter from President Roosevelt. (Havas dispatch, 14th)

Paris: US Undersecretary of State Welles arrived here by plane from London on Sunday afternoon in order to travel on to Rome before returning home. British Ambassador to France Sir Ronald Campbell, US Chargé d'Affaires to France Mr. Murphy, and many other dignitaries welcomed him at the airport. After disembarking, Welles was accompanied by Murphy to meet with Prime Minister Daladier for a conversation lasting thirty minutes. Afterwards, when reporters asked him to express his feelings about the trip, he replied, "No comment." (Havas dispatch, 14th)

London: US Assistant Secretary of State Welles and US Ambassador to Britain Kennedy last night again held talks with Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax for an hour and a half. Afterwards, Welles and Kennedy dined with the Prime Minister. Welles met with Lloyd George yesterday to discuss matters for eighty minutes, then met with Bruce, the High Commissioner for Australia in the UK, and visited the Dominions Office to meet with Dominions Secretary Eden. Later, he also spoke with Maxton, the leader of the Independent Labour Party. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)

London: US Undersecretary of State Welles met with Lloyd George, the British Prime Minister during the last World War, for eighty minutes yesterday. At the same time, British Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler denied in the House of Commons yesterday that Welles had submitted a memorandum to the British government outlining US foreign and economic policies. (Associated Press dispatch, 14th)

London: US Assistant Secretary of State Welles spent four busy days in the UK, meeting with numerous British government officials and political leaders. He departed for Paris today and will meet with Mussolini and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano in Rome before returning to Washington around the end of January. According to Reuters diplomatic reporters, the main feature of Welles' report to President Roosevelt will be a repeated statement of the outlines of the minimum peace terms that the Allies and Germany might accept, as well as Italy's postwar desires. Many neutral country reporters traveling with Welles believe that the information he has collected seems likely to lead President Roosevelt to appeal for peace negotiations. However, when assessing the feasibility of this action, the impact on the US domestic and political situation must also be taken into account. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)

Milan: According to the "Popolo d'Italia"'s correspondent in London, British political figures hope that the United States will launch a peace offensive. It is widely rumored that after US Undersecretary of State Welles returns home, the United States will put forward concrete peace proposals. (Haitong dispatch, 14th)

London: US President's envoy, Undersecretary of State Welles, accompanied by US Ambassador Kennedy, has departed from here today after holding final talks with British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax. A tragic peace initiative has also come to an end with Welles' departure from Europe. Welles saw no glimmer of hope for peace in Europe. What he can report to President Roosevelt is a terrifying picture: both sides of the European warring nations are stubbornly clinging to the current stalemate and will not give up until one side is exhausted and defeated. In the past 24 hours, the reaction in London to Welles' visit has undergone a complete transformation, even giving him the nickname "busybody." The Daily Mail commented on Welles' trip, "We are fighting for our survival and do not want to be dissuaded by silver-tongued people." The influential Daily Mail also stated bluntly on the front page that Welles' visit to Europe was related to Roosevelt's own government's future. Two weeks ago, general hopes here were high, but now those hopes have gone with Welles and seem to have been replaced by open and unhidden suspicion. When Welles was treated by senior officials, what he heard was, of course, only the most careful comments. If Welles could have immersed himself among the people, he would have seen the anti-American sentiment that is rising. As far as reporters know, the attitude of Britain towards the US in 1916 seems to be reviving. There is now a widespread opinion here that the United States is reaping huge profits, playing the role of Shylock. Although US Ambassador Kennedy has tried hard to dispel this rumor, this opinion has not only not disappeared, but is also spreading. Even the learned are becoming increasingly critical of the United States. An important official told a reporter, "Britain does not mind that the United States does not join the war, but the fact that the United States misunderstands Britain's motives for fighting cannot but make the British people feel uneasy." The British people are now gritting their teeth, determined to fight the war to the end, no matter how great the cost or how long it takes, until final victory is achieved. There is not a single person who does not hold this attitude. Therefore, given the current situation, unless Hitler completely surrenders, the British will never rest. The attitude of France is the same. Germany is now overflowing with resources and seems able to generously take advantage, but the US State Department and its envoy Welles can only obtain pessimism from Hitler. If President Roosevelt's decision to run for a third term depends on Welles' report, then please Roosevelt make a decision immediately. As for the realization of peace, it seems that the earliest hope will be this winter, but if a great war breaks out this spring and summer, then the prospects for peace will certainly be even more distant. From the Near East to London, reporters have heard calls for peace along the way, but what they have seen here is an unbreakable hatred, with the strong implication that "not showing sympathy is tantamount to hostility."

### MacDonald to Visit Paris; To Discuss Colonial Issues

Paris: British Colonial Secretary MacDonald is scheduled to lead a number of experts to Paris in the near future to hold talks with French Colonial Minister Mandel.

### French Senate Holds Closed-Door Session; Debates Soviet-Finnish Incident

Paris: The Senate convened a meeting here at 3:10 PM today. First, Senator Jeanneney reported on the inquiries raised by the Senators. Prime Minister Daladier immediately delivered a speech, stating briefly that while the government could immediately discuss the inquiries concerning the Finnish-Soviet issue, he requested that the discussion of the inquiries concerning the current war in Western Europe and other related military matters be postponed. After discussion by the Senators, the Senate finally unanimously decided to hold a closed-door session to immediately debate the issue of the Soviet-Finnish peace negotiations. (Havas dispatch, 14th)

### US Aircraft Export Issues

Washington: The US House Armed Services Committee yesterday investigated the issue of aircraft purchases from the United States by Britain and France. According to well-informed sources, the committee will first seek the opinion of Secretary of War Woodring. The committee took this action because Britain and France requested to order large quantities of aircraft, citing that their own aircraft production capacity was not as great as Germany's. Senator Thomas offered to investigate rumors about how this aircraft order would affect the US military preparedness plan. Undersecretary of War Johnson also opposed divulging military secrets to the Allies. President Roosevelt has convened a Cabinet meeting, chaired by Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau, to reconcile the views of various departments. Roosevelt, Woodring, Johnson, and Secretary of the Navy Edison all participated. According to the Secretary of the Navy, the British order for aircraft does not hinder the US military preparedness plan, and military secrets will not be leaked. (Haitong dispatch, 14th)

Washington: The House Military Subcommittee began reviewing the government's policy of supplying military aircraft to the Allies today. Secretary of War Woodring will be the first to express the government's views. Yesterday, President Roosevelt consulted with aviation experts in the Defense Department on the extent to which the United States must fulfill foreign orders in order to help increase the United States' ability to build aircraft, thereby strengthening national defense. Undersecretary of War Johnson told news reporters that he strongly opposed setting aside US orders and trying his best to fulfill Allied orders. The United States has signed a contract to supply foreign countries with the Curtis P-40 fighter, which is indeed very superior. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)

### Military Backing of the British Empire; Eden Issues Statement

London: Dominions Secretary Eden stated today at a gathering of the Foreign Press Association that the assistance the British Empire is now receiving is unparalleled in history. When this assistance is fully utilized, it will have a decisive impact on the war situation. The British Empire Air Training Plan is now in full implementation, and it is estimated that no fewer than 50,000 pilots, airmen, and observers can be trained each year. The Australian Navy has left its homeland and is taking on part of the responsibilities at sea. He felt that when he met with Hitler previously, Hitler was constitutionally unable to understand the psychological and spiritual workings of a free democratic country. No matter how the war progresses, there can be no hesitation or compromise at this time. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)

### German Coal Sufficient for Italian Consumption

Rome: After Italy and Germany concluded an agreement on coal, Italy obtained one million tons of coal per month from Germany, totaling twelve million tons per year. Thereafter, all of it was transported by rail. With this German coal, combined with domestic coal production, Italy has enough for its own consumption and does not need to rely on British coal or buy coal from the United States. According to informed sources, after Italy purchases additional coal from Germany, the quantity of agricultural products and food exported to Germany will certainly increase to pay for the coal. (Havas dispatch, 14th)

Berlin: The "Völkischer Beobachter" commented on the German-Italian coal transportation agreement in this morning's article, stating briefly that Germany is now transporting coal to Italy by land, which is a blow to Britain's attempt to force Italy to make concessions at sea. When Germany and Italy sought economic and political cooperation, Britain used various means to obstruct them. Today, Germany has become Italy's sole supplier of coal, and economic cooperation is extremely close. Italy no longer needs to seek fuel from other countries. (Haitong dispatch, 14th)

### Zhu Jiahua Discusses the European War: Not Unfavorable to China; Chinese Diplomacy Can Maneuver with Ease and Bears an Important Mission for World Peace

(Chongqing Correspondence) Dr. Zhu Jiahua, Minister of Organization of the Central Party Headquarters and Vice President of the Chinese Branch of the League of Nations Union, is an expert on international affairs. Recently, at the invitation of Chongqing University, he gave a speech on "Impressions of the European War." Mr. Zhu used statistical figures to deduce the future of the European war. His conclusion elaborated that the European war is not unfavorable to China. The full text is extremely insightful and has been personally proofread by Mr. Zhu. It is essential reading for those who care about the global situation. The original text is recorded below:

1.  The Origin of the War

Since the outbreak of the European War, although the front line has only seen skirmishes, forming a stalemate, judging from the trend, no matter how hard various parties mediating for peace try, the issue of war and peace in Europe is still unclear for the time being.

In the last World War, the belligerent countries sacrificed nearly 20 million lives and countless sums of money to obtain the Treaty of Versailles. Having learned from pain, Europeans cherish the peace treaty obtained at such a high price. European politicians have been painstakingly trying to maintain the treaty while avoiding unfortunate events that frequently arise from it as a starting point. However, the Treaty of Versailles, achieved through numerous hardships, only barely supported the peace that everyone admired for twenty years before throwing the war-weary people of Europe back into the embrace of the god of war.

The reason for the outbreak of the last war was that the national policies of various countries were influenced by the expansion of production, leading to a scramble for colonies, raw materials, and markets. The famous Prussian military scholar Clausewitz once said, "War is a continuation of politics." The evolution of European politics had reached a point where it could not advance any further, so they did not hesitate to use war to alleviate political difficulties, resulting in an unprecedented tragedy in history. In 1919, when everyone gathered in Versailles, they each harbored fears about the future, believing that as long as they restrained the defeated countries and prevented them from retaliating, future wars could be avoided. Therefore, the root causes of the outbreak of the 1914 war were not thoroughly examined or eliminated, so the Treaty of Versailles could not establish a foundation for lasting peace. Moreover, because the politicians after the war still clung to old ideas and did not seek change, they did not adopt new opinions to solve new problems.

The so-called new problem is the increasingly excessive production that comes with post-war recovery and prosperity. The so-called new idea is to abandon the scramble for resources and markets and, based on the spirit of international technical cooperation, jointly develop underdeveloped areas to absorb and solve all surpluses. This was the original suggestion of our Premier Sun Yat-sen. In his "Industrial Plan," Sun Yat-sen said, "Recent world wars have proven that humanity suffers from war, whether victorious or defeated, and the instigators suffer even more. This is true for those who fight with force, and even more so for those who compete with trade. President Wilson has already established the League of Nations to prevent future wars of force. I would like to further promote international cooperation to develop China, so as to avoid future trade wars. In this way, the greatest cause of future wars can be fundamentally eliminated." Such profound words, a good contribution to world peace, have been consistently upheld by China. The Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee last year reiterated and clarified them. Unfortunately, few listened. For twenty years, European politicians failed to pay attention, leading Europe to repeat its mistakes and resort to arms again.

2.  Strategy

At the beginning of this European War, some people overestimated the power of scientific weapons, believing that once the belligerent countries came into contact, there would be a very fierce large-scale battle immediately, and that European culture would inevitably be destroyed. However, this is not the case in reality. The facts of the past six months tell us that the belligerent countries are both adopting a strategy of attrition, rather than a blitzkrieg of annihilation. What is most noteworthy is that they focus on naval and air warfare, remaining entrenched on land. This can be said to have created a new record in war history. From the beginning of the war until now, it can be said that "there is no war on the Western Front," with no trench warfare, let alone a main force battle of general attack.

So why is the strategy of attrition adopted by both belligerent countries this time more thorough than that adopted in the second half of the last war? This naturally stems from the lessons learned from the last war. People know that the reason why Germany failed last time was due to insufficient economic strength. Clausewitz also said, "War is a political game played with different tools." Today, we may say that "war is an economic competition of weapons." Therefore, if we want to understand the strategies of both belligerent countries and predict the way out of this war, then we should start by analyzing the economic status quo of each belligerent country, so as not to deviate too far from the facts.

### Jiangsu Provincial Government: Coordinating Freight Transport and Regulating People's Livelihood; Organizing a Trade Commission as a Specialized Agency

Xinghua Correspondence: In order to collect materials, coordinate freight transport, and regulate the people's livelihood, the Jiangsu Provincial Government has specially organized the Jiangsu Provincial Trade Commission to handle matters related to unified enterprise, transportation, and trust. The commission was officially established on [blank] of this month and held its first meeting, passing the organizational charter of the Jiangsu Provincial Trade Commission and starting to draft various operational rules. The commission consists of 25 members, including members of the provincial government, heads of various departments, and heads of various offices as ex-officio members, as well as Lu Xiaobo, Wu Yunshan, Huang Pichen, You Jinsheng, Wang Dajue, Li Limin, Ge Bingzhi, Ling Huian, Lu Xuanzhi, etc. as members. A chairman is also appointed, concurrently held by the chairman of the provincial government, and a chief secretary is appointed by the provincial government. Five standing committee members are appointed by the Secretary-General of the Provincial Government, the Director of the Department of Finance, the Director of the Department of Construction, the Director of the Jiangnan Administrative Office, and a member appointed by the Provincial Government. The commission has four departments: General Affairs, Enterprise, Transportation, and Trust, each with a director to handle various businesses. Offices are also established in the locations of the provincial government and administrative offices to facilitate trade connections. It is reported that the commission's trade funds are provided by the provincial government, but are settled monthly, with 80% of the profits turned over to the provincial treasury, and the remainder used as public reserve funds and employee bonuses. These measures are currently being submitted to the Provincial Government Committee for approval and reported to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Economic Affairs for record.

### Japanese Merchant Shisu Prepares to Open a Silk Factory, Sericulture Industry Will Be Completely Seized

Suzhou Correspondence: The southwestern townships of this county, including Mudu, Guangfu, Xiangshan, Hengjing, Dongshan, Huguan, Wangting, Dongqiao, Huangdai, etc., have traditionally been sericulture areas. Before the war, the Wuxian County Government specially established a Sericulture Guidance Association, sending experts to guide farmers to improve silkworm rearing methods. Over the years, the total output has reached more than 20,000 dan for the entire county, accounting for more than 30% of the province's output. After the fall of the area, most of the mulberry trees in the sericulture areas were cut down by the Japanese army for fuel, causing the sericulture industry to plummet. Last spring, some farmers, forced by livelihood, continued to plant mulberry trees and raise silkworms, but as a result, due to the Japanese manipulation of market prices, they did not benefit much. Many even suffered losses due to the high price of mulberry trees. At the end of last month, a large number of Japanese people came to Suzhou from Shanghai, surveying sites in the Panmen and Xudou areas, preparing to open a silk factory, and bringing 50,000 sheets of Japanese silkworm eggs, colluding with puppet police, and going to various villages to force farmers to buy them. It is reported that the price is 1.5 Japanese yen, and it is stipulated that the farmers who buy the silkworm eggs must sell all the fresh cocoons to the Japanese factory in the future. At the same time, the Japanese intelligence agency also notified the fresh cocoon market from the beginning of this month to close immediately. Therefore, in the future, the sericulture industry in this county will be completely seized by the Japanese.

### Founder of Scouting, Baden-Powell, Passes Away; China Scout Association Sends Condolences by Telegram

(Chongqing Aviation News) Lord Baden-Powell, the founder of the Boy Scouts, passed away in Africa last year at the age of 83. The China Scout Association recently received a letter of condolences from the International Scout Bureau, and Chairman Chen Lifu has sent a letter on behalf of the national male and female scouts to express condolences and to comfort his family.

It is reported that Baden-Powell was a British Londoner who joined the army at the age of 19, held important military positions, and rose to the rank of Lieutenant General and Cavalry Inspector General. In the summer of 1907, Baden-Powell selected more than 20 children on Brownsea Island for outdoor camping, teaching them various knowledge of daily life, with great success. This was the first Scout troop in the world. The following year, he published the book "Scouting for Boys," which became popular throughout the country. The Scout movement then developed rapidly in England and gradually spread to the world. In 1910, he resigned from all military positions and devoted himself to this cause. In 1909, he developed the Girl Scout organization. In 1916, he founded the Cub Scouts. In 1918, he started Rover Scout training. In 1929, he was awarded the title of Marquess by the King of England for his meritorious service in founding Scout education.

The aim of Scout education is to utilize the lively and active nature of young children, focusing on outdoor activities, imparting common sense, promoting handicrafts, strengthening physical fitness, cultivating character, and promoting patriotic ideas. It has the basic values of general education, so various countries have adopted it one after another, integrating its organization and training principles into national policies to cultivate the youth and children of their own countries into healthy citizens. There are now Scout organizations in 50 countries around the world, with more than 3 million members.

Baden-Powell devoted himself to Scout education for more than 30 years, publishing 28 kinds of works. He usually advocated that young people of all countries should be friendly and kind to each other in order to establish a foundation for world peace, sparing no effort, and his contribution to the world is very great.

Causes of Rising Prices Summarized

According to reliable sources, the meeting's content involved the subcommittees submitting reports summarizing their investigations to Eugène, Chairman of the Price Stabilization Committee, and conducting discussions on general price issues. It is said that the causes of the current price increases, according to the investigation results of each group, can be summarized into three factors: speculative manipulation, supply difficulties, and exchange rate relations. Except for the exchange rate factor, which is a financial problem that cannot be solved independently, efforts will be made to resolve the remaining causes of price increases as soon as possible. The content of the reports prepared by the two subcommittees and the general effective measures proposed to suppress and stabilize prices have been submitted to the French Consul-General for approval and implementation. Although the Public Concession authorities did not send representatives to the subcommittee meeting the day before yesterday, the opinions of the two Concession authorities are completely consistent and maintain close contact. It is reported that the two Concession authorities will jointly negotiate specific measures to suppress and stabilize prices, and will take consistent and effective steps to resolve the causes of speculative manipulation and supply difficulties that have led to price increases.

The Shanghai Times reported that the French Concession Price Stabilization Committee held a plenary meeting on the 13th, and the subcommittees investigating rice, coal, flour, and other daily necessities submitted their reports, and immediately passed a resolution to be submitted to the French Consul-General. Once the French authorities have agreed on joint measures with the Public Concession Works Department, they will be implemented. It is reported that the two Concession authorities will be able to take joint action within days.

Hoping for Public Supervision

The high price wave in this city threatens the livelihood of the entire citizenry. Since the French Concession Municipal Council and the Public Concession Works Department have successively established special committees to conduct research and investigations, the soaring prices have been significantly curbed. The Works Department has also formally announced strict measures to crack down on hoarding and manipulation, and will prosecute and punish those who seek profit without regard for the people's hardships according to law. Public organizations such as the Shanghai Citizens' Association are hoping that citizens, with their own interests at stake, will jointly supervise and report to the authorities as much as possible if they find out about hoarding and manipulation. In addition, trade associations in various industries have also begun to assist the authorities in adjusting prices in the same industry, because if things go to extremes, those who suffer in the future may still be the industries themselves. Thanks to the cooperation of all parties, the trend of rising prices can be curbed.

### Further Arrival of About 40,000 Bags of Foreign Rice; No More Under-the-Table Transactions; Domestic Rice Also Transported to Shanghai from Inland Ports; Owners Eager to Sell, Prices Continue to Drop by About One Yuan

The French Mail Steamship Company's regular mail ship "Chafei" (霞飛), which started from Marseilles and sailed to the Far East this time, was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday, but it is now learned that it arrived earlier at about 9:00 a.m. the day before yesterday (the 13th), and sailed to the Hongkou Gonghexiang Wharf at noon to dock. The ship loaded more than 38,000 bags of foreign rice via Saigon. It has been unloaded yesterday and is scheduled to leave Shanghai for Japan this morning. It will return to Shanghai around the end of the month to return to Europe. Jardine Matheson's "Yongsheng" (永生) vessel arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong the day before yesterday and also transported 1,617 bags of foreign rice, which were unloaded at the Roosevelt Wharf warehouse. It is reported that the ship also has 177 bags of Indian rice and 994 bags of Tianjin rice, which are all on board. It is scheduled to set sail and transport to Yantai and Tianjin tomorrow.

Rice Market Closely Supervised

The authorities of the two Concessions are actively working to suppress the prices in this city, and are paying special attention to the people's food. Supervisors appointed by the authorities are stationed in the rice industry tea market regularly, working closely with the market management committee to monitor the market's operations and report the number of transactions and actual sales in the market to the authorities on a daily basis for verification. The practice of various rice merchants evading registration and engaging in under-the-table transactions in the past has not been discovered for a long time.

Supply Exceeds Demand, Rice Prices Continue to Fall

In addition to the arrival of about 40,000 bags of foreign rice mentioned above, 2,700 to 800 bags of domestic rice were also transported from inland ports. Under the circumstances of sufficient inventory and owners urgently seeking to sell, rice prices continued to fall by about one yuan yesterday. Saigon No. 1 rice is now at 43 yuan in national currency, a difference of 12 to 13 yuan compared to the highest price of rice.

### Jesson Dockyard Workers Strike; Three Russian Police Injured

At 3:10 p.m. yesterday, workers at the Jesson & Co. dockyard at 614 Yangshupu Road suddenly went on strike. The Central and Huishan police departments immediately sent more than 50 police officers to suppress the strike, but when they arrived at the factory, three Russian police officers had already been seriously injured. It is reported that a total of more than 500 people participated in the strike. As for the demands made by the workers, according to Mr. Bonner, the factory manager, last night, it is not yet known, because they are engaged in negotiations with the workers' representatives. According to another source, the workers put forward a total of nine conditions, the most important of which are wage increases and rice subsidies. The workers unanimously resolved yesterday that if the demands are not fully accepted by the factory, they will refuse any mediation. It is understood that at 6 p.m. yesterday, more than 500 workers gathered in the factory to wait for a solution. Subsequently, the police repeatedly persuaded them before they dispersed.

### City Chamber of Commerce Agrees with Yitaixing Company to Supply Price-Controlled Coal Ash; Daily Supply of 57 Tons Allocated to 16 Factories; Coal Briquette Warehouse Receipts to be Cleared Today Without Extension

Since the beginning of the price-controlled sale of coal briquettes, although each person is limited to buying 20 cents worth, buyers still flock to buy them, greatly benefiting the common people. However, due to the high price of raw materials (coal ash), a request was made to Mr. Yu Qiaqing to find a way to reduce shipping costs. More than ten days have passed, and no definite news has been received. Now, in order to remedy the situation, the small coal briquette factories have asked the Public Association to find a way to suppress the market price of coal ash. The association immediately sent Chen Cuifang, Huang Yuxiu, Xue Bofang, and Zhou Baosun to the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce yesterday to make a request for assistance. The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce agreed to convene representatives of various coal ash dealers on the 16th of this month to discuss appropriate measures to provide assistance so that the small coal briquette factories can continue to ship goods and supply the market.

Price-Controlled Period

The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Chamber of Commerce of the Coal Briquette Industry, saying: "We are writing to inform you that in order to maintain coal briquette production, eliminate panic, and provide relief to small coal briquette factories, from today until the 31st of this month, please have the Yitaixing Coal Company supply 57 tons of price-controlled coal ash daily according to the regulations, and allocate it to 16 factories. Enclosed is a list of factories and tonnage allocations. We hope that your association will quickly inform the factories to contact Yitaixing Coal Company for processing. This is of utmost importance. Sincerely."

Allocation Methods

The following methods have been established for remedying the small coal briquette factories: (1) Factories without inventory should check the actual daily production and supply tonnage. If more purchases are required, they should be calculated at market prices. (2) Purchase spot goods for cash on a daily basis, and warehouse receipts will not be issued. (3) Hongji No. 2 ash will be reduced by 10 yuan in legal currency per ton at market price (i.e., 100 yuan per ton) until the end of March in the lunar calendar. (4) Those who have not cleared their low-price coal ash warehouse receipts or who have repeatedly failed to repay their loans will not be supplied. (5) Coal ash purchased previously will not be returned.

Warehouse Goods Cleared

The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce had previously convened a meeting with coal industry-related organizations to urge all coal briquette warehouse receipt holders to ship goods within a time limit so that there would be more spot goods on the market. It was decided that the deadline would be on the 15th of this month. Since the announcement, many warehouse receipt holders have gone to ship goods, but a few have still not done so. The industry association has decided not to extend the deadline any further and will end it today. A reporter from the Xin Sheng Bao learned from the industry association yesterday that those warehouse receipt holders who still fail to ship goods in accordance with the regulations today will be severely punished after public discussion as a warning to others.

Boiled Water Association

The Shanghai Boiled Water Industry Association held a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees yesterday afternoon at 7 p.m. Chairman Zhang Delong reported on the purpose of the meeting, stating that in order to take into account the livelihood of the poor and social security, the industry has resumed selling water, enduring pain and making sacrifices. However, the way to remedy the situation lies in suppressing the market price of coal ash, so it is proposed to continue to negotiate with the Mining Bureau to supply coal for fuel at low prices. All the attending committee members unanimously agreed. As for the various proposals, they will be formally announced today.

### Works Department Chief of Finance Talks; Increase in Surtax Difficult to Stop; Cites Various Benefits for Chinese; Does Not Discuss Citizen Affordability

Mr. Mauger, the chief of finance of the Works Department, gave a speech at the Rotary Club in the Capital Hotel yesterday, stating that the recent opposition from all walks of life to the Works Department's decision to increase the municipal surtax was due to the fact that they were not aware of the increase in various demands made on the Works Department by all walks of life in recent years. The Works Department's various measures for the Chinese and Japanese in this port in recent years are countless, and the strongest opposition to the decision to increase the municipal surtax by 50% from July 1 is from the Chinese and Japanese, which makes it difficult for him to understand. Mr. Mauger continued to say that when the Chinese government withdrew from Shanghai, the Works Department took over the prisoners in various prisons on its behalf, and the various facilities for Chinese education are also too numerous to mention. As far as the current municipal surtax policy of the two Concessions is concerned, there are indeed differences, because the Works Department adopts the so-called "colonial divisional regime," while the French Municipal Council adopts a completely "democratic regime." As far as the current year's budget is concerned, the expenditure of the Public Concession has increased by a total of 7 million yuan due to the above-mentioned requirements, of which 3,157,190 yuan is used for education, 2,722,190 yuan is used for prisons, and 1,190,430 yuan is used for commercial groups. As for the French Concession, this kind of expenditure is greatly reduced. If all the expenses of the fire brigade and the police station are added to it, the number will be even greater.

### Post Office Designated as Restricted Area; Great Inconvenience to the Public; Vehicles Carrying Mail Cannot Cross Bridge; Parcel Printing Plans to Relocate for the Better

Since the Shanghai Postal Administration Building was designated as a restricted area in Hongkou by the Japanese on the day of the incident, the public has suffered mental pain and inconvenience in their actions when going to the bureau to post mail. The following is a record of the various situations:

Extreme Inconvenience to the Public

Since the Japanese side, in the name of the "Concession Forces Command," extended the wire mesh from North Sichuan Road to the bridgehead of the Waterworks Bridge, and the road along North Suzhou Road to the north bridgehead of the Sichuan Road Bridge of the Postal Administration was suddenly cut off, those who went to the bureau had to detour through the Sichuan Road Bridge, which caused extreme inconvenience to the public posting mail.

No Results from Negotiations

After the above-mentioned incident occurred, although Shanghai Postmaster General [unclear] specifically dispatched Japanese Deputy Postmaster General Kanesashi Ichiro to negotiate with the Japanese Consulate and other relevant parties, the Japanese side used the excuse that the area north of Suzhou Creek, west from North Henan Road, was its defense zone, and there were no results.

Must Pass Through Japanese Military Outpost

The inconvenience to the public caused by the Postal Administration Building being designated as a restricted area is evident in that, in addition to having to pass in front of the Japanese soldiers' outpost when going to the Administration Building to post mail, heavy items such as parcels and printed matter, which must be transported by vehicles, generally have to detour through the Zha Pu Road Bridge.

Vehicles Cannot Cross the Bridge

Not only that, but all vehicles carrying mail, whether for business trips or moving equipment, including cars and rickshaws, cannot pass through the north of the bridge. Therefore, the senders had to find a way to carry the mail back and forth across the bridge by hand, and then hire a car to send it to the bureau, which is how inconvenient the transportation is.

Japanese Blame Car Dealers

According to a reporter from Datong News Agency, the Shanghai Postal Administration also raised the above-mentioned facts of inconvenience with the Japanese side, but the Japanese side said that the reason why vehicles cannot load and wait for mail to cross the bridge is due to the North District car dealers' discrimination against business competition, and it is not the intention of the Japanese side.

Considering Relocation for the Better

Now the Postal Administration is considering relocating the Parcel and Printed Matter Section to other sub-bureaus, and there is a proposal to move it to the Jiangxi Road Post Office, but the location and area for stacking parcels or printed matter is quite a problem, so it has not yet been decided.

### Anti-Tuberculosis Campaign in This City Opens Today; X-Ray Exhibition Held at the Same Time

The Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Campaign, initiated by local leaders Lin Kanghou, Yuan Ludeng, and Ding Fubao, is scheduled to hold its opening ceremony at 3 p.m. today at the Hongqiao Sanatorium at 99 Avenue Joffre, and an X-ray photography exhibition will be held at the same time. All sectors are welcome to visit. Starting at 4 p.m., a group X-ray examination of citizens will be carried out. All those found to have lung disease will be given free X-ray photography. Mr. Ding Fubao, the vice president of the association, donated 6,000 yuan, which is specially used to purchase X-ray photography film, and a major philanthropist donated a huge sum of 10,000 yuan. With this assistance, the association is more excited about all its work. Guo Shun, Jiang Yiping, Zhao Jinqing, Xi Yushu, Pei Yunqing, Zha Xiaochu, Xu Guanwei, Li Ze, Li Wenjie, Zhang Jingli, Zhang Jingdi, Long Xingwu, Wang Boqi, Ma Yinliang, and Dong Xingsheng have been hired as executive committee members, and He Dekui, Wu Yunqi, Huang Hanzhi, Guan Jiongzhi, Jin Zongcheng, and Cai Chang and many others have been hired as committee members, and Ding Huikang is the general manager, promoting everything, and working with the greatest effort to reduce the spread of pulmonary tuberculosis and improve the health and social security of citizens.

### No Definite News on Cancellation of "Passes" in Nanshi

There have been rumors in Nanshi for days that the Japanese side will cancel the so-called "passes" from today (the 15th) in order to "prosper the market," but as of last night, this rumor has not been confirmed. According to someone who serves in a related field, the abolition of the "passes" in the so-called "safe area" north of Lujiabang must be implemented sooner or later, but the date has not yet been decided. Roughly, it depends on the future of the gambling dens in West Shanghai. If West Shanghai stops gambling, and Nanshi inherits its [unclear], then the "passes" will be revoked immediately, it is said.

### American Journalist Talks About Deteriorating Relations Between Japan and the United States; No Improvement Possible in the Near or Distant Future; Japanese Farmers Forced to Manufacture Cannons

James A. Michener, editor of Collier's magazine, who once came to China in 1937 to investigate the Sino-Japanese war, recently went to India with his wife from Manila, intending to stay there for three weeks to investigate the current situation there and the impact of the European war. When [Mr. Michener] made a stopover in Shanghai on his way to Manila, he went ashore for sightseeing. In 1927, the American warship Panay was bombed. His wife happened to be on the ship and witnessed the brutality of the Japanese aircraft. When Mr. Michener was residing in Japan, he wrote an article published in a Manila newspaper, believing that the reason why the Japanese-American Treaty of Commerce and Navigation could not be renewed was entirely due to Japan's face-saving considerations and its unwillingness to yield to the United States. He believes that there is no possibility of improvement in Japanese-American business relations in the near or distant future. He has a detailed observation of the Japanese government's planned control. He said that Japan began to implement this plan as early as two years ago. By next spring, he expects that even Japanese farmers who work ten hours a day in the fields will be forced to manufacture aircraft or cannons in factories set up by the state. At present, Japan is extremely short of salt, sugar, gasoline, and other daily necessities. There are very few cars on the road, because the government has banned unnecessary gasoline consumption.

### American Consul General Gauss to Take Office in Australia Next Month; Important Decisions Recently Made with Admiral Hart; To Be Implemented After Arriving at New Post

According to news from the US Consulate, US Consul General to Shanghai, Mr. Gauss, is scheduled to leave Shanghai for Australia at the beginning of next month. It is understood that Mr. Gauss had been ordered to be transferred to the US Consul General to Australia long ago, but the order to leave Shanghai and take office had not yet arrived in Shanghai, so he has not yet made the trip. According to reliable sources, Mr. Gauss recently had a meeting with Admiral Hart, Commander of the US Asiatic Fleet, and made a decision on the US's position in the Pacific. Mr. Gauss's trip to Australia will be to implement the results of their discussions.

Reluctant to Leave After Many Years in China

According to a US Consulate official, Consul General Gauss has become an important figure in the Far East since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, and has been working diligently day and night, with almost no time to spare, which is truly admirable. Since 1906, he has been working for the government, serving in Washington and Paris for several years before being sent to China, where he has been for 33 years. During this period, due to his duties, he has traveled all over China, from Shanghai, Tianjin, Xiamen, Jinan, Shenyang, and Peiping, and finally transferred from Peiping to Shanghai. Now he is leaving Shanghai for Australia, so he really feels reluctant to leave this second home.

### Edison Bulb Factory Labor Strike Resolved

A labor strike at the Edison Bulb Factory on Robison Road in West Shanghai, which employs approximately 1,500 workers, was resolved after negotiations between labor and management. The strike had been initiated due to worker demands for increased wages, which were initially unmet. Ultimately, labor representatives presented a proposal for salary increases, and mediation by the Jing'an Temple Road Police Station led to an agreement. The factory management accepted the proposal to increase monthly wages for each employee, and all workers officially resumed work yesterday.

### Refugee Association Writes to Various Industries, Continuing to Solicit Donations

The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association previously launched a fundraising campaign because refugees from the occupied areas gathered in Shanghai, in order to provide long-term support. Leaders in various industries in the city, in the spirit of human mutual assistance, have been working hard on this fundraising campaign. Since its inception, it has achieved remarkable results. However, the association had previously notified various industries that there were regulations on the deadline for donations. It is now learned that the deadline will expire in turn, and [the disaster] continues to rise, causing general refugees to be unable to reflect on life. The association itself also feels that it is difficult to continue to provide for the more than 30,000 refugees in the city who have not yet been completely repatriated. It specifically notified various industries the day before yesterday to continue to raise donations in order to implement the original intention of providing disaster relief.

### Twenty Gambling Dens in West Shanghai May Close; Date is the 20th of this Month

The Continental News reported that it is heard that gambling dens in West Shanghai are currently paying heavy donations in order to obtain a business license. However, these 20 gambling dens will be closed on the 20th. But every time the closure period approaches, the gambling dens pay huge sums of money to survive. On the 10th of this month, the gambling dens were closed for one day, but 20 of the 23 gambling dens each paid 20,000 yuan and were able to continue operating. The donation fee for the gambling dens is approximately 500,000 yuan per month.

(Another report) The problem of the closure and survival of large and small gambling dens in the extra-settlement road area of ​​West Shanghai, according to the person in charge, has the possibility of closing on the 20th of this month. According to reports, the 20 large gambling dens in the "badlands" are currently open as usual, but they will also announce their closure before the 20th. The rumor that they were closed on Tuesday night is inaccurate. There was a proposal to order them to close in the middle of last month. The owners of these gambling dens, seeing the "gambling dens" as the source of their lives, paid huge sums of money to maintain their business. On the 10th of this month, 20 gambling dens were closed for one night, but each gambling den paid 20,000 yuan. Since the Public Works Department and the puppet "municipal government" signed the Provisional Police Agreement on the extra-settlement road area of ​​West Shanghai on February 12, the new patrol team there will be established and patrol will be implemented. Therefore, all gambling dens may be closed on the 20th of this month, it is said.

### Curfew Hours, Pedestrians Encounter Violence, Sun Fengming Injured

At 3:30 AM yesterday morning, a sudden axe attack occurred at the intersection of Xiaoshadu Road and New Jiapo Road in West Shanghai. It is reported that the victim was Sun Fengming, 43 years old. While passing by, he was attacked with an axe, sustaining injuries to his back, hands, and feet. He collapsed from his injuries with blood gushing out. Seeing that their objective was achieved, the assailant fled with the axe. Neighbors heard moaning and opened their doors to investigate, discovering Sun lying in a pool of blood, injured all over. They called an ambulance which transported him to the Labor Hospital for treatment. The police are currently investigating the circumstances of the attack.

### Robbers Resist Arrest, One Robber Wounded and Captured, Stray Bullet Injures a Pedestrian

At a certain hotel at the intersection of Maite Hesi Tu Road and Xin Zha Road, several robbers suddenly arrived at around 10 PM last night. They broke into the hotel, brandishing guns to intimidate. They stole a significant amount of national currency and subsidiary currency from the counter, but the exact amount is unknown. As the robbers were fleeing with the loot, a clerk from the hotel followed behind and alerted the police on patrol, who gave chase. The robbers turned around and opened fire to resist arrest. The police returned fire, and several shots were exchanged. A robber named Zhu Tianyuan, 27 years old, was shot and wounded on the spot, sustaining one bullet wound each to his right arm and left leg, and collapsed. He was arrested and taken to the police hospital for treatment. A stray bullet also struck a pedestrian named Lu Guojie, 30 years old, who lived nearby at number 41, in the leg. He was quickly taken to Binlong Hospital by police officers from precinct 2287.

### Chicken and Duck Boat Robbed, Boat Owner Cut

Xu Rongsheng, a 31-year-old native of Pudong residing at number 239, East Street, Nanhui City, primarily sells chickens and ducks. Yesterday morning around 5 AM, a batch of his chickens and ducks were being transported by a private boat to Shanghai for sale. When the boat reached Datuan Town, several robbers ashore, wielding guns, ordered the boat to dock. The boatmen dared not disobey and steered the boat to the shore. The robbers swarmed aboard and searched the three people on the boat, stealing dozens of French currency dollars, clothing, and bedding. When Xu Rongsheng and the boatman, Shen A'er, 29 years old, offered slight resistance, they angered the robbers, who used knives to inflict severe wounds on both of them. After the boat arrived in Shanghai, people transported the two injured men to a hospital for treatment.

### China Relief Society Promotes Refugee Production Plan, Avoids Unnecessary Waste of Labor, Contributes to Wartime Production

The Central Relief Committee believes that, among war-zone refugees, apart from a few who can support themselves, the majority, 80-90%, are unable to do so. How to resettle them long-term, prevent this large workforce from being wasted, and guide them to contribute to wartime production is a critical issue. It has been learned that the Committee, having considered previous refugee relief methods, has formulated a comprehensive refugee production plan and issued instructions to relevant agencies for active implementation. The content includes: (1) Concentrating agricultural talents from guerrilla areas to refugee-receiving regions to organize group farming, with the aim of collecting refugees, engaging in production, and stabilizing their lives. (2) Promoting and managing small business loans and land reclamation loans for refugees, and encouraging refugees to claim and cultivate wasteland. (3) Selecting appropriate locations to establish small-scale factories to provide work for refugees and achieve self-sufficiency (proposed factory types: earthwork factories, cloth shoe factories, thread sock factories, towel factories, small cotton textile factories). (4) Promoting and managing subsidies for land allocation and house construction to help refugees become self-reliant.

### Raw Materials for Biscuit and Bread Industry, Flour Mills to Provide as Much as Possible, Fuxin and Fu Already Agreed

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, based on the request of member factories and shops affiliated with the Biscuit, Candy, Canned Food, and Bread Industry Association of this city, which specialize in manufacturing biscuits and pastries for sale, totaling twenty-four establishments employing nearly ten thousand workers who depend on this for their livelihood, where large factories need about one hundred bags of flour daily and small factories need several bags daily, has observed that since the price of flour in the market has risen, the supply of raw materials has also been affected. If these factories are forced to suspend operations due to a lack of raw materials, it will inevitably disrupt social stability. Therefore, in accordance with the Association's request, it prepared a letter of introduction, and the Association dispatched personnel to negotiate directly with the Fuxin and Fu flour mills, requesting that they supply as much as possible at market prices, according to the required quantity, so that products can meet market demand without fear of shortage.

### Xilimen Gambling Den Security Shot, Tao Chengquan Shot, Ambushed While Riding in a Car, Two Gunshot Wounds, Condition Very Critical

At 1:40 PM yesterday afternoon, an assassination occurred near the Xilimen gambling den on Jing'an Temple Road. The victim was Tao Chengquan (40 years old), a security guard at the gambling den. Tao had just finished work, was wearing a Western suit, and was walking out of the den. At the intersection of Diji Road, Tao was about to board a public bus going east when suddenly four men appeared, lying in wait. One of them immediately drew a gun and fired four shots at Tao. Two bullets struck Tao in the lower body, and he immediately bled profusely and collapsed to the ground. Seeing that their objective was achieved, the four men fled in different directions. Police arrived and transported Tao to Tongren Second Hospital for treatment. His condition is very critical.

Another report: Tao Chengquan, a native of Nanhui, currently in his forties, has a residence at No. 65, Yong'an Lane, Jing'an Temple Road, West Shanghai. He was working as a lookout at the Xilimen gambling den in Diji Road. Around 3 PM yesterday afternoon, Tao left his house and noticed a crowd arguing at the entrance of the Xilimen lane. Tao went forward to investigate. Unexpectedly, one of them pulled out a pistol and fired several shots at him, hitting him with two bullets, one in his abdomen and one in his right leg. Blood gushed out. The assailant then left. Police transported the man to Tongren Hospital for treatment.

### Contractor Builds Houses, Unauthorized Mortgage of Land Certificate, Miao Songyin Arrested, Huang Ruisong on the Run

Miao Songyin, a 55-year-old native of Tongzhou, along with Huang Ruisong, who is currently on the run, first established the Songsheng Construction Company at No. 1, Songqing Lane, Avenue Joffre. On December 16th of last year, they contracted with the Zhongyu Bank to build houses on land registered at No. 5503, Lingshi Road, Avenue du Roi Albert, according to the land certificate No. 291. Lu Xien (55 years old, from Shanghai), the manager of Zhongyu Bank, signed a contract with them. Lu handed over two land ownership certificates, a building permit issued by the Bureau of Public Works, and house plans to Miao and Huang. Unexpectedly, Miao and Huang disappeared.

Then detective Shen Lianfang reported the defendant's resistance to arrest. The plaintiff, Lu Xien, also stated the experience of being deceived.

### Letter

To the editor: According to the client Zhang Ronghai, upon reading your newspaper's article "Unmarried Minor Woman's Inheritance Confirmed," which stated that Zhang Ronghai lives at No. 3, Jian'an Lane, Ximen Road, and runs a brothel, etc., this is incorrect. The undersigned previously served in the police and is currently an official. Both positions are highly respected and have nothing to do with running a brothel. Furthermore, since childhood, I have been raised as the son of the deceased Zhang Chunlin and his wife. Prior to this, Lin Gen, the adopted son of the deceased Chunlin Gong, and his wife, made a settlement with the entire Zhang family and their daughter Maotou in 1933. All of the above should be corrected in the form of a letter from a lawyer to correct the record. I request that the newspaper grant the correction. Sincerely, Lawyer Xu Wufang, March 13.

### Finance - Forward Foreign Exchange Tightens Across the Board, Spot Exchange Not Significantly Affected, HSBC Continues to Sell British Gold, US Exchange Tightens More Sharply Than British

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no change in HSBC's listed prices. The black market for British and American exchange rates continued to soften, but the situation was very peculiar: HSBC was willing to supply spot exchange at a rate of 4 shillings 1.125, and the volume reached over 600,000 pounds, but due to tight credit, there were few spot buyers, and the price was not significantly affected. On the other hand, demand for forward exchange was high, and it continued to tighten. The April forward rate had already entered the 4-shilling barrier. Because the declines in US-British exchange rates were unexpected this morning, the opening price was only down by half a point. The opening price of US exchange was relatively hard, but Sassoon first absorbed it, followed by aggressive buying from Japanese banks and buying from Chinese banks, so the price gradually softened. Fortunately, HSBC supplied spot British gold as much as possible, so it was able to hold steady, while forward exchange followed and tightened slightly. By closing, British gold was still 4 shillings 1.125, and US exchange was only 6.375 yuan. After the afternoon, tightening continued, especially in forward exchange. However, HSBC continued to maintain spot British gold, so the momentum was slightly dampened. Therefore, the closing price of British gold was still 4 shillings 1.125, and US exchange had tightened to 6.34375 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous day, the British rate was flat and the US rate was tighter by 0.09375. The potential of forward exchange continued to diverge from spot exchange.

HSBC Sold 600,000 Pounds

At the beginning of the morning, the London exchange rates for near and far months fell by 1.875 each. The New York silver price remained flat, and the London gold price remained stable. The exchange rates for British, American, Shanghai, and French exchange rates were all flat. The US exchange rate tightened by half a point against the British pound, fell by 0.2 yuan against Shanghai, and fell by a small amount against France. The central bank's listed prices for each exchange rate remained the same. The bank's opening spot selling price in the morning was 4 shillings 1.125 for British gold and 6.46875 yuan for US exchange, compared to the previous close, the British rate was flat and the US rate was looser by 0.03125. This was because the exchange rate decline was not significant. After the opening, Sassoon first absorbed spot US exchange at 6.46875 yuan. Following this, a certain bank absorbed HSBC spot British gold at 4 shillings 1.125. At this time, foreign banks were already interested in buying spot US exchange at 6.46875 yuan, so the market seemed stable but slightly soft. After the announcement that the HSBC listed prices remained unchanged and that the silver balancing tax was down 1.125 points, Japanese banks suddenly began aggressive buying, strongly absorbing HSBC spot British gold at 4 shillings 1.125 and foreign banks' May forward British gold at 4 shillings 0.015625, and May US exchange at 6.21875. Later, Chinese banks also followed in absorbing foreign banks' May US exchange at 6.40625. This created a steady situation with slight tightening. After 10:30 AM, Japanese banks resumed their activity, and Chinese banks continued to buy, and American banks also started to show buying interest, so the market suddenly tightened. Japanese banks closed in foreign banks' May US exchange at 6.1875, and American banks absorbed their May US exchange at 6.375. By closing, British gold was 4 shillings 1.125 and US exchange was 6.375. The May British gold was 4 shillings 0.09375 and US exchange was 6.34375, compared to the morning opening, the British rate was flat and the US rate was tighter by 0.09375.

April British Exchange Advances to 4 Shillings

The market initially opened flat, but then Japanese banks and speculators bought forward contracts, and some also closed positions, so the market continued to tighten. However, HSBC was still willing to supply current shillings, so it remained stable, but forward contracts tightened across the board. Foreign banks and Japanese banks closed in HSBC spot British gold at 4 shillings 1.125, totaling 200,000 pounds. A certain bank absorbed Chinese banks' April US exchange at 6.21875. Later, a buyer also ate up Chinese banks' April US exchange at 6.1875, and Japanese banks also bought foreign banks' April British gold at 4 shillings. At the same time, Chinese merchants also purchased foreign banks' April US exchange at 6.1875 and 15625. By closing, British gold was 4 shillings 1.125 and US exchange was 6.34375. The current month British gold was 4 shillings 0.046875 and US exchange was 6.25. The next month British gold was 3 shillings 984375 and US exchange was 6.125. As a result, compared to the previous day, spot prices were flat for the British and tighter by 0.09375 for the US. This month British tightened 0.0825 and US softened 0.15625. Next month British tightened 0.0825 and US rose 0.1875.

### Another Surge in Rising Prices: New Gold Prices Emerge One After Another; Yesterday, the Top Price Soared to 5,145 Yuan

Yesterday, the spot gold market situation once again created a new historical gold price record. The gold rush was overwhelming, astonishing those who heard of it. The reason was that the exchange rate was tight, and a certain securities group continued to invest, coupled with the fact that operators in the government bond and stock markets were all concentrating on gold. Everyone believed that buying gold was the only way to preserve wealth, so the price could only rise and not fall. At its peak, it reached a high price of 5,145 yuan. At the closing bell, it was still 5,130 yuan. Regarding the situation of the day, the market opened sharply lower by 55 yuan in the morning due to the strong US dollar exchange rate and the selling by gold firms. Shortly after, the US dollar exchange rate rebounded, arousing excitement among the people. Retail investors bought heavily, and securities groups absorbed continuously. Hong Kong groups also entered the market at this time. Although there were also sellers, ultimately, due to the difficulty in balancing supply and demand, the flames of rising prices became unstoppable, reaching 5,080 yuan. Later, many who had made profits sold off, causing a pullback of 29 yuan. However, due to a sudden rush to purchase by gold firms, the price was raised again to 5,068 yuan. In the afternoon, various groups were searching for gold, once again pushing the price to a peak of 5,145 yuan. Although there was a slight setback later, buyers did not stop, so the result was a sharp increase of 135 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was approximately 4,000 taels. Gold jewelry in silver shops rose by 15 yuan, reaching a peak of 520 yuan. Customs gold and other types remained stable.

Spot Gold Jumps by Over 100 Yuan Again

Since the morning, the initial opening price per bar (ten taels) dropped sharply by 55 yuan due to the strong US dollar exchange rate and weak market sentiment. Gold firms and money exchange businesses sold to suppress prices, with gold firms selling 20 taels to silver firms at 4,940 yuan. Shortly after, the US dollar exchange rate suddenly rebounded, and buyers rushed in. Securities groups and retail investors bought at the low, pulling the price up by 55 yuan. Securities groups bought 10 taels from gold firms at 4,995 yuan. Subsequently, a certain silver firm and jewelry group sold, while gold firms also sold, suppressing the price by 33 yuan. Gold firms sold 50 taels to silver firms at 4,962 yuan. After that, the US dollar exchange rate suddenly softened, and it was reported that although spot gold was stable, futures were slightly tighter. Therefore, market sentiment recovered, and securities groups and a certain silver firm scrambled to buy. At the same time, Hong Kong groups also came to search for gold, coupled with retail investors following suit, resulting in a leap of 118 yuan. Silver firms bought 20 taels from jewelry groups at 5,080 yuan. Then, a certain jewelry group and securities group sold to realize profits, and buyers gradually decreased, causing a small pullback of 29 yuan. Silver firms traded 20 taels at 5,051 yuan. Near the closing bell, a certain gold firm suddenly came to purchase, raising the price by 19 yuan. Gold firms bought 50 taels from securities groups at 5,070 yuan. Following that, money exchange businesses sold 10 taels to silver firms at 5,068 yuan, as the afternoon closing price. The initial opening price in the afternoon was stable. Securities groups initially absorbed 50 taels from money exchange businesses, still at 5,068 yuan. Later, due to tight foreign exchange futures prices, securities groups, a certain silver firm, and gold firms rushed to buy. In addition, Hong Kong groups were also active. Soon, the price surged by 52 yuan, jumping beyond the 5,100 yuan mark. A certain jewelry group bought 50 taels from gold firms at 5,120 yuan. Afterwards, a certain gold firm exited the market with substantial profits, and Hong Kong groups ceased buying, causing a small pullback of 50 yuan. Securities groups traded 50 taels among themselves at 5,070 yuan. At that time, securities groups had strong buying interest and absorbed over 200 taels. Simultaneously, a certain money exchange business also came to buy, and as the exchange rate futures continued to soften, the price surged again by 75 yuan. Gold firms bought 30 taels from jewelry groups at 5,145 yuan. After entering the market, a certain silver firm suddenly sold high, and many retail investors closed out positions, causing a drop of 45 yuan. A certain silver firm sold 50 taels to money exchange businesses at 5,100 yuan. Finally, a certain money exchange business saw an opportunity and bought, and securities groups also bought, raising the price by 30 yuan. A certain silver firm bought 50 taels from gold firms at 5,130 yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, the price increased sharply by 135 yuan compared to the previous day. It had been rising for five days, totaling 354 yuan, with a fluctuation of 205 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of spot gold from reputable gold firms was several yuan higher, while the buying price was reduced by 20 yuan. The current bid price was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, with little activity.

Gold Jewelry Listed at 520 Yuan

The initial selling price of gold jewelry per tael was still listed at 505 yuan by Dahang Tong. At 10:30 AM, it increased by 5 yuan. At 3:00 PM, it increased by another 5 yuan. At 4:15 PM in the evening, it increased by another 5 yuan. As a result, Dahang Tong changed its listing to 520 yuan, a new record high since the market's existence. The listing price of Sinhang Tong was the same, with the buying price reduced by about 15 yuan.

### Food: Manipulation of Foreign Rice Has Reached Exposure; No. 1 Saigon Rice Only Opened at 42.5 Yuan; Manipulating Hoarders Could Not Have Imagined Such a Terrible Fall; A Huge Drop of 10 Yuan in Two Weeks

Yesterday, the source of domestic rice,粳米 (Jing rice) and糯米 (glutinous rice), was from 12 trucks carrying over 600 bags transferred out of Hongkou. It was said that the off-market price outside the rice market was even more sluggish, and transactions were extremely rare. The market price had fallen by about 1 yuan, and the outlets for rice were also scarce. Moreover, with the arrival of new shipments, people were even more uneasy, resulting in a high price for inferior goods, a decrease of 1 yuan, while medium and lower-quality goods were reduced by 1.5 yuan. Since the previous market, the price of various kinds of foreign rice has first tightened and then weakened. Yesterday, market sentiment declined further. Foreign firms were still selling at low prices, leading original grain merchants and speculative hoarders to sell off, causing the market to fall further, which was rare this year. The market-wide transaction seemed to have come to a standstill until the market closed without any change. Statistics on the prices of various goods showed that both Saigon Small Grain were all continuing to fall sharply by 1.5 to 2 yuan compared to the previous market. If No. 1 Saigon rice closed at only 42.5 yuan, Fire Grain at 41 yuan, Small Grain at 38 yuan, No. 2 Siam at 38 yuan, and Mixed Broken Rice at 34 to 33 yuan. Looking back at the sharp fall in rice prices this time, based on the highest price of 52 yuan for No. 1 Saigon rice at that time, it has fallen sharply by 10 yuan in two weeks. Moreover, the current price of 42.5 yuan for No. 1 Saigon rice has fallen below the closing price of 43 yuan last year. The same is true for other goods such as Fire Grain. This was beyond the expectation of the rice industry, especially for the speculative hoarders who specialized in speculation and manipulation, but it was a cause for joy for ordinary people who depended on rice.

Yesterday, the wholesale market for foreign rice continued to decline. The market opened in the morning with high prices due to the rise in gold prices, and sellers intended to support prices. However, the supply of goods arriving from various sources was continuous, and general speculators were under pressure from tight monetary policy and had to sell at reduced prices. No. 1 Saigon March futures opened at 52 yuan, then fell to 51.3 yuan. In the afternoon, it was 51 yuan, and there were no buyers. No. 2 opened at 47.5 yuan, and Small Grain opened at 48.35 yuan. The market was weak and lacked transactions. The original package of No. 2 spot goods also started at 46.5 yuan and fell to 46 yuan, and the original package of Small Grain spot goods also fell to 47 yuan, which was nearly 1 to 1.5 yuan lower than the day before. However, market sentiment was weak, and the market situation was not yet stable, and the speculators still had the appearance of eagerly seeking to sell their goods.

Over 30,000 bags of foreign rice continued to arrive. The French ship "Xia Fei" brought over 30,000 bags from Saigon. Jardine Matheson's "Yongsheng" ship brought 1,617 bags from Hong Kong, which were unloaded yesterday. It was reported that the "Yongsheng" ship also had 1,077 bags of foreign rice bound for Yantai and 994 bags of foreign rice bound for Tianjin, which would be shipped to Yantai and Tianjin tomorrow on the same ship.

### Poor Sales to Customers; The Price of Returned Flour Weakens Again

Yesterday, the flour market showed signs of weakening again. The market for returned goods had been tightening for several days after the lifting of the export ban. However, although exports were not restricted, Northern merchants were still not enthusiastic due to the sharp fall in prices in Tianjin. In addition, rice prices in Shanghai continued to fall, and market sentiment was inevitably weak. It was said that the asking price for "Green Cannon" brand was still 15 yuan, but there were no buyers. "Old Cannon" brand initially opened at 14.5 yuan, and then weakened to 14.43 yuan. The market later opened at 14.4 yuan, but only scattered purchases from inland regional merchants. The market changes may have to wait until the end of the low-price period. It was said that after the expiration of the "Maintenance Flour", the factory's price will inevitably increase.

The wheat market was also quiet yesterday. After Suzhou wheat opened at 25 yuan the day before, buyers successively complained about the high price. However, sellers were determined to hold on because of the shortage of inventory and the failure to arrive of foreign wheat. There were no transactions in the morning. It was said that only one lot of Suzhou wheat was offered in the after-market, with a price of 24.75 yuan, which was slightly lower by 0.25 yuan compared to the previous day.

### Securities: Rumor of British Following US Aid to China; Public Bonds Market Sentiment Exuberant

Due to the rumor that Britain would follow the US to automatically aid China, the international situation was good, and the market sentiment did not reflect the shrinking of the US dollar exchange rate and the soaring gold price. Market sentiment suddenly turned exuberant, and the auction prices unanimously rebounded. Whether it has the ability to continue depends on how the facts turn out. Judging from the environmental situation, public bonds will not be too soft. Yesterday morning, the market price rose slowly due to a temporary change in market sentiment. Type C once again broke through the 89 mark. Lianhe had some replenishment. Yongkang, Taifeng, Renchang, and No. 64 all had demand, but Hu Heji, Yida, and No. 25 were still being sold off. In the afternoon, Xieda, Shengda, Jiufeng, and Lianyi all had sales, and Yongkang continued to replenish. No. 4, No. 16, and Tiansheng also had purchases. The market price increased by 0.125 yuan, resulting in a rebound of 0.25 to 0.4 yuan compared to yesterday. The total transaction volume was approximately 700,000 yuan. A concise table is recorded below:

Stock trading, 50 shares of Guanshengyuan were traded at a price of 25 yuan. The stock market of the Public Industry Association opened steadily yesterday. Later, due to speculative sell-offs, prices fell slightly, and the transaction volume was not large. Rubber stocks did not break the dull situation due to the tight exchange market.

London, 13th (Wednesday) telegram: The listed market prices of Chinese foreign debts today were still stable, and there were no changes in the upper and lower grades of various bonds.

Gulagram Rubber fell by 7.5 pence, to 21 shillings and 3 pence. The new price of Shanghai Waterworks A shares after ex-dividend was £15, which was £1 lower than yesterday. Only Kailuan Coal Mine bearer shares rose by 3 pence, with a price of 19 shillings, and the rest were stable.

### Yarn and Cotton: Cotton Yarn Mills Changed to Selling for Cash; Although There Were Some Sell-Offs During the Rise, Market Sentiment Was Still Firm and High

The yarn market continued to rise, with a very strong trend. This was due to the shrinking of the US dollar exchange rate, soaring gold prices, and increased market sentiment, which fueled buying interest. However, due to the high base prices, some had a tendency to sell off. Therefore, during the drastic rise in prices, there were sell-offs. However, the prices offered by the manufacturers were extremely high, and all were changed to cash sales. As a result, large buyers were actively purchasing, and the market trend was still prosperous.

The morning opening for spot yarn saw market sentiment slightly loosen due to the fall in overseas cotton markets, and profit-taking long positions emerged, resulting in a slightly weak market. The price of 20-count Double Horse in March was 970 yuan, and it immediately fell to 963 yuan. Shortly after, it was heard that the exchange rate had been reduced again, market sentiment gradually increased, and there were large buyers who were buying, so the market price gradually rose to 981 yuan. According to statistics, the transaction volume in half a day was 2,043 packages. The spot price of 20-count Double Horse yarn rose by 16 yuan. On the 15th, 45 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong and 155 pieces were shipped to Xiamen. The amount purchased by various regional merchants is listed as follows: Fellow merchants: 1,863 Hong Kong: 160 Fuzhou: 10 Inland: 10 Total: 2,043

### Sluggish Cotton Market; Although US Cotton is Small, Factory Demand is Not Healthy

Transactions in domestic cotton have been relatively sluggish. This is due to the mediocre price of Indian cotton and the lack of shrinkage in the British exchange rate, resulting in slightly weaker sentiment. However, the purchasing prices remain high. The US dollar exchange rate has shrunk drastically, making 42-count raw materials very expensive. The factory's demand for Xin Naxi is healthier, but there is no amount of quota available for collection. Therefore, the market is stable. From Subei sources, 1,106 packages of Datong Flower have arrived. The current cotton situation is as follows: Pingguo Er: 186.00 Fellow merchants bought: 900 pieces North Taicang: Straw bag: 207.50 Also: 260 packages Also: 204.00 Also: 200 packages Wujiang Flower: 239.00 Shen Xin purchased: 1,000 dan Tongda Packaging: 213.00 Fellow merchants bought: 200 pieces

Foreign Cotton Market Prices: In the New York cotton market, the morning initially saw prices decline due to reports of falls from Liverpool. Later, prices fell again due to mass sell-offs and the liquidation of some long positions, especially for deferred deliveries. As a result, closing prices fell by over ten pounds for near-term deliveries and twenty-two pounds for deferred deliveries. Indian shipments are forecast to fall by another eight rupees. Egyptian prices saw both rises and falls.

Another report: Due to the tightening of the British and American exchange rates in the Shanghai port foreign cotton trade recently, the US dollar exchange rate has shrunk to 6.375 yuan. Although the US cotton fell by over 20 pounds yesterday, the converted cotton price did not fluctuate much. However, market sentiment is not as firm as it was a few days ago, so the transaction is quite quiet. The factory does not want to offer new yarns, so it has not taken any action. The price of US cotton sent to the factory converted at a US dollar exchange rate of 6.375 yuan is as follows: 20-count US Middling: 279.50 Also, Lower Grade: 269.60 32-count: Also: 293.00 Also, Lower Grade: 282.00 42-count: Also: 295.00 Also, Lower Grade: 285.60

### Piece Goods: Domestic Merchants Actively Buying; Cotton Cloth Continues to Rise

The cloth market continues to rise due to the brisk sales in the local and Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong regions. The industry reports a contraction, and both inside and outside the industry have the idea of ​​doing more. The selling price of coarse and fine cloth has risen by 0.25 to 0.5 yuan, fine twill has risen by 0.125 yuan, and bleached, dyed, and printed cloth from factories such as Luncang and Yihe has increased by 0.5 to 1.5 yuan. The turnover in the local market reached more than 1,000 pieces. Merchants from Wen Ning in eastern Zhejiang bought more than 500 pieces of coarse cloth, bleached cloth, and colored cloth. Merchants from Fujian and Guangdong also bought more than 100 pieces each.

The trade in East Cloth in the local market is brisk. White fine cloth and fine twill each continued to rise by 0.3 to 0.4 yuan per piece, and colored serge rose by 1 cent per yard. However, the factory warehouse receipts of Longtou fine cloth, where the goods from last year that have not been sold in March, must be charged a warehouse rent of 10 yuan per piece in April. Therefore, there is a distinction between new and old warehouse receipts, and the selling price differs by 0.15 to 0.2 yuan per piece. So yesterday, when the price was firm, the old warehouse receipts of Longtou were 28.2 yuan, while the new warehouse receipts had to be 28.35 yuan. The current issue of Four Gentlemen serge has increased to 8.475 cents, and the next month is even more expensive, with sales opening at 8.6 cents. On the 14th, 47 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong and 280 pieces were shipped to Haiphong. On the 15th, 9 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong.

### Sugar Market: Dutch Red Opened at 3,000 Bags

Yesterday, the sugar market continued to exhibit upward momentum. The Association's designated price for spot goods was 24 yuan for coarse white, up 0.5 yuan, at 63.5 yuan for both local and foreign new goods, and 63.2 to 63 yuan for old goods. Transshipment goods remained at 49 yuan. Dutch red was up 0.5 yuan, MP Mark at 48 yuan, WA Mark at 47.5 to 47.2 yuan. The Joint Venture opened for sale over 3,000 bags of WA Mark transshipment goods at a price of 39 yuan. Taikoo Che Bai also rose by 0.3 to 0.5 yuan, B Mark East warehouse at 67 yuan, West warehouse at 67.5 yuan, CW Mark at 67 yuan, CX Mark at 66.6 yuan, DY Mark at 66 yuan, HX Mark at 65.5 yuan, and the East warehouse goods were discounted by 0.5 yuan. H Mark Che Chi rose by 1 yuan, new goods at 45.5 yuan, East warehouse at 45 yuan, and old goods at 44.5 yuan. Local Xue Bai was 63 yuan, up 0.5 yuan, local Bing rose by 1 yuan, No. 1 was 75.5 yuan, and Jing Ming Bing was 77 yuan. Dongxiang red from Guangsang locally produced sugar was traded for over a thousand bags, with special high-grade at 41.2 yuan, medium-grade at 40 yuan, and those with soft identity at 39.3 to 39.5 yuan. 100 bags were opened yesterday, with soft identity at 39.4 yuan. Several dozen bags of Hainan foreign were at 51 yuan. Jianbang opened for sale 200 bags of Diaoh Qing, still at 49 yuan.

### Oil Market: Prices Too High; Raw Soybean Oil Difficult to Sell

The market for soybean oil and peanut oil has not seen much development recently. The fluctuation range is only within one yuan. In short, prices are expensive, and there is a sense that the moving funds have become too large. Therefore, both buying and selling are sluggish, and the rise and fall are also slight. However, the recent trade has shown some activity, and the market price has risen by two yuan in the past two days. However, sales are only within the tastes of local shops. Yesterday, the total market traded 230 barrels of Dalian soybean oil at a price of 116.5 to 117 yuan, 20 barrels of Changzhou soybean oil at a price of 115 yuan, 20 barrels of Hankou soybean oil at a price of 112 yuan, 50 barrels of Bengbu soybean oil at a price of 112 yuan, 10 barrels of Jiangbei soybean oil at a price of 115 yuan, 100 dan of Dayou factory soybean oil at a price of 91 yuan, 300 pieces of Yantai soybean oil at a price of 82 yuan, 20 barrels of Qingdao peanut oil at a price of 114 yuan, 30 barrels of Jiangbei raw oil at a price of 112 to 112.5 yuan, and 600 cans of Yantai raw oil at a price of 104.5 yuan.

### Opening the Dams

The five dams downstream of the Grand Canal are: Cheluo, Nanguan, Xinba, Zhongba, and Zhaoguan. Only Zhaoguan is located in the territory of Ganquan, and the remaining four dams belong to Gaoyou. In the fifth year of Tongzhi, there was a flood. The opening of the dam was delayed, resulting in the breach of the Qingshui Tan embankment. Subsequently, Cao Shuai Wu奏 (memorialized) the determination of restrictions. The opening and closing were timely, so over the years, major disasters have not been brewed. It is planned that every year before autumn, the limit is set. When the water level is one zhang and four chi, Cheluo is opened. Over four cun, Nanguan is opened. Over four cun, Xinba is opened. Another four cun, Zhongba is opened. After autumn, the Cheluo system is set, with a water level of one zhang and two chi and eight cun as the rate, and the Nanguan dams are still limited to four cun. In the sixth month of last year before the full moon, there were heavy rains for ten days. In addition, the upstream water势 (power) of Honghu was high, and the limit had been exceeded by more than one chi before autumn. The superior authorities all said that they should be conservative. Yang Daoxian, Pang Sheng San observed, personally came to the project to see if opening the dam was for the sake of the people's lives, or if protecting the dam was for the sake of the people's livelihood. They all thought that it was for the sake of the people and should not be biased. The water level was protected until after autumn, when the water level reached one zhang and six chi. Therefore, Cheluo was opened on the 16th, Nanguan was opened on the 20th, and Xinba was opened on the 24th. The water situation gradually receded.

### Giant Monkey Becomes a Worship

There is a village in India called Agubala. Recently, 200 large monkeys suddenly came. Experts say that this is a species of Baipomu. This type of monkey is about three to four chi tall, strong, and bold. They are not afraid of people at all and enter the homes of the villagers to grab fruit and food and play with miscellaneous things. Women and children are all abused by them. People hate them but dare not attack them. Because this type of monkey will retaliate in groups if one of them is attacked, even the police dare not do anything about it. It is now heard that they have奏 (memorialized) to the 朝 (court), asking to send troops to suppress them.

Spring and Autumn

### Business Ethics and Reputation

— Chu

Since the discovery of lining the rice bucket with manure paper and lining the oil scoop with 洋鉛皮(white lead skins), almost every day new methods of deception are discovered, such as insufficient weight on scales. In today's life where prices are so high, this kind of layered exploitation, we feel that simply imposing fines does not seem to be enough to serve as a warning to others.

However, these methods of deception certainly did not start today. We have never seen people who buy oil actually weigh it, and no one cares about the weight of rice and grains. Other biscuits and candies naturally do not pay attention to the difference in weight. So, deducting one or a few from ten or one hundred seems to be normal behavior, not worth mentioning. For example, recently two well-known biscuit and candy companies were also found to have insufficient weight on their scales and were fined. A certain plantation company even used unsterilized milk on the market. They are all long-established companies in Shanghai. How could they be willing to destroy the company's business reputation for a small amount of profit? If you allow me to say something arbitrary, their scales have weighed countless tons of biscuits and candies, and unsterilized milk may have caused people to have gastrointestinal diseases, but it was only discovered today.

The first and most important thing in doing business is to adhere to business ethics, and at the same time, pay attention to your own shortcomings everywhere. Don't think that because customers are careless, you can deal with them casually; you must know that the carelessness of customers is a sign of trust in you, which is the most valuable harvest in business, but once a problem is discovered, the profits you have harvested cannot make up for the losses you will suffer.

As for those who deliberately use deceptive means to deceive customers, there is naturally no question of morality. I have already said that fines are too light a punishment for them. However, in the final analysis, the most important thing in doing business is reputation. After a reputation goes bankrupt, it will inevitably encounter the greatest punishment.

### Discussing Graduation Yearbooks

— (Quan)

Recently, various schools are preparing to publish graduation yearbooks and annual yearbooks. Regarding various issues, a certain newspaper has launched a heated discussion. At a time when citizens of all levels in the isolated islands are seriously threatened by prices, I would also like to express my humble opinion to discuss it.

The issuance of a yearbook or annual report naturally has commemorative significance; this significance certainly cannot be erased. The issuance of this kind of commemorative book may become a precious page in a person's life history. When I graduated from high school, although I did not express opposition to the issuance of the yearbook, I did not pay attention to it. Many years later, when I occasionally flip through it, recalling my life as a student, I can't help but feel vicissitudes. At that time, a book that was not worth paying attention to has now become my treasure. However, things have changed, and now a graduation yearbook requires 4 to 5 yuan, which is not only too wasteful, but also in the current economic difficulties, this 4 to 5 yuan cannot be borne by ordinary parents.

I believe that the commemorative nature of a yearbook does not lie in the splendor of the decoration, the exquisite paper, or the publication of a few copied academic articles. I think that the yearbook must truly achieve commemorative value, such as emotional words between teachers and students, and real records of each student's life at school. Other prefaces, empty farewell feelings, and artistic works of flowers and birds do not need to waste space, and only white paper printing is required. This saves money and has a real commemorative meaning. Or a small number of students in a grade cannot afford this expense, then of course they cannot be forced; you can take a group photo together, and use the group photo to make a zinc plate for printing. (Because if you ask a photo studio to print more, the price is extremely high.) Then everyone signs on the back of the group photo. I think a photo like this is enough to be worth a thick, splendid yearbook. Then print a directory (which can be printed on a mimeograph), which is truly a simple and inexpensive yearbook. Writing this, I thought of someone last year who advocated donating yearbook fees to save lives. I think a splendid yearbook can be omitted, but at least a simple and inexpensive souvenir must be printed, and then use the remaining money to save lives, wouldn't that be good?

### New Shanghai Commodity Price Lament (Part 2)

— Tu Shouzuo

Today, the price of tofu equals that of meat, with ten squares selling for one silver dollar. Compared to the past, it's shocking, a fivefold increase since before the rice war.

For New Year banquets, guests are invited, and sumptuous dishes display wealth. A single course can cost fifty or sixty yuan, yet people say the styles are unadorned.

Guests are offered cigarettes in white tin packages, but even that is considered thrifty and ridiculed. A canned pack sells for about two yuan, casting good money into the fire.

A cleaver costs four yuan and change, and the price of Fuyang straw paper keeps rising. Most other types of paper are incredibly expensive, with red paper selling for two hao per sheet.

The selling price is different from before, what can one do? Socks are worn out, and it's time to buy new ones. Real stockings cost one yuan and eight jiao, and cotton socks are more than six jiao per pair.

Red and green tea, used to quench thirst, have seen their prices increase again and again. Each pound costs at least one yuan and six jiao, with old leaves lacking the fragrance of young buds.

Fried dough sticks resemble hinge supports, and sesame cakes look like crab shells. One piece costs two fen in legal tender, causing hunger among the working class.

Everyone is raising prices with a ruthless heart, subtly increasing costs while reducing quantity. One Yuan head silver coin buys three pounds of goods; New Year cakes, both yellow and white, are traded by the English weight.

Noodle shop owners are also cunning, demanding a temporary halt to the production of plain flour. The new price is four jiao and six fen for two jin, as the machinery grinds back into operation.

The price of fresh fruit on trees is increasing, and even when available, it's hard to buy. Fortune oranges can only be replaced by mandarin oranges, with one yuan buying only two jin.

Comparing the present with the past is impossible; as the water rises, so does the soap head. In the past, one sheep weighed nine pounds, but now four pounds is all one can get.

Gold is the central hub of the market, where foreign exchange speculation determines gains and losses. The five-hundred-yuan mark is on the verge of being broken, causing the most alarming impact on commodity prices.

Fish and shrimp enhance the pleasure of wine, but at this moment, fish and shrimp are unbearably expensive. One liang of green fish costs one jiao, and each live shrimp costs three fen and three li.

Sales are unique, and prices are considered low; no one is hoarding salt. One yuan buys one hundred and ten liang on the vegetable scale, and the deal can still be negotiated with a slight addition.

Oppression has become stricter, making it hard to clothe oneself and impossible to remain silent. After surviving the chaos, one worries about clothing and food, with daily life more difficult than scaling steep cliffs. (To subsidize the stabilization of rice prices)

### To Those Who Sympathize with Impoverished Students - Reply to Gentlemen Zhi and Tao -

— Qiang Gong

Since my humble work "An Absent Student" was published on the sixth of this month, I hoped to lighten the burden on my heart, as it was merely the duty of the writer to report. Now, the editorial department has forwarded letters from Gentlemen Zhi and Tao, both expressing sympathy for an absent, impoverished student and willing to provide assistance, inquiring, "If there is such a case, please provide the address of the impoverished student. Or is it a small piece of social writing depicting the current state of affairs?" My respectful reply is as follows:

An absent student exists, and the situation is real; even if Mr. Tao believes it is "a small piece of social writing depicting the current state of affairs," it must have a subject to depict, not something conjured out of thin air.

Because Gentlemen Zhi and Tao have shown compassion for the impoverished student and wish to provide assistance, I express my deepest gratitude and have sent a school servant to investigate the address and bring the original letters from Zhi and Tao to the student as "rice coupons." However, the student has already returned home, and their earnest intentions cannot be conveyed. The misfortunes of the poor know no bounds! The student did not register for the current term, and the previously described situation occurred last winter during a snowy scene.

However, in today's isolated island, there must be many such impoverished students. In the future, I will report any encounters to Gentlemen Zhi and Tao so that their desire to benefit impoverished students can be fulfilled as soon as possible. I will also collect information on the oppressed groups in society and the inhuman situations they face, writing about them to find a path of mercy for the disaster victims. I hope that beyond Gentlemen Zhi and Tao, more people will rise up.

Episode 21: Combining Economic Principles with Delicate Maintenance; Enhancing Machinery to Aid Literary Achievement

Miss Zhu Airen and Miss Zhen He had never visited a newspaper office abroad and found it very interesting. Shao Huihua said:

'The evening paper here is not very extensive, it is only in Shanghai city and a few places near Shanghai that it can be delivered on the same night. Because at six o'clock, there are still trains and buses leaving Shanghai for various docks, so the last evening paper is rushed out to catch this time. That's only running a very small part of the machinery, if it's the morning paper, then all the machinery is started, that's a sight to see.' Wu Junsuo said: 'Oh! Are all these twenty-odd machines running?' Shao Huihua said: 'Although not all of them are running, at least eighteen or nineteen are running. The remaining few are either having some problems, but they are prepared as backups. Or because they are too tired, too exhausted, like a person, they also need to rest. The newspaper has to be published every day at the same time, there can't be any delays, so it's better to have a few more machines.' Wu Junsuo said: 'After the newspaper comes out of the machine, what's the second step?' Shao Huihua said: 'Don't you see a large skylight above each machine? This skylight is the next floor. The printed paper is automatically transferred from the machine to the skylight on the upper floor and delivered upstairs. Upstairs, near the skylight, are the packing rooms, where the machine automatically delivers the paper, and then someone packs it. From the packing room to the truck transporting the paper, there is also a small track that is temporarily set up. When the truck is full, it speeds away, to the train station, to the ship dock, to the airport. Generally, from the time the roll of blank paper is sent to the machine, until it is printed, packed, loaded, and transported onto boats and airplanes, it takes no more than ten minutes. The distribution time can be considered extremely efficient, and this is because everything is in order, so it can be done step by step. And this is a daily occurrence, and once you get used to it, it becomes second nature.' Wu Junsu said: 'Amazing! Do these machines have to be divided by province? You said there are twenty-four machines, are they divided into twenty-four provinces? Or is each machine given a place name, as the name of the machine, like the street names in Shanghai, with Shandong Road, Shanxi Road, Hubei Road, Henan Road names. Otherwise, why is there a sign on each machine, with the names of various places written on it?' Shao Huihua looked at it and smiled, 'This makes a lot of sense.' She pointed to a machine near her and said: 'For example, the machine above has a sign with the name of Zhejiang Province, needless to say, the newspapers printed on this machine are all transported to Zhejiang Province. If it is marked with another province, it is transported to another province.' (250)

### Citizens of the Kingdom of Heaven (4)

We cannot assume someone is a citizen of the Kingdom of Heaven just because they are respectable. A respectable person may never uphold justice, support morality, or have generosity, courage, and selflessness. Nicodemus was a respectable man, and Pilate was also a respectable man, but they lacked the courage to uphold justice at risk. Many respectable people can only passively avoid doing evil, but cannot actively promote justice. Morally, they are correct, but spiritually, they are dead. They believe in God, but are unwilling to take risks for God; they believe God maintains justice, but at crucial moments, they rely on human power instead of God. They are afraid to sacrifice or engage in moral or spiritual risk-taking. Therefore, to be citizens of the Kingdom of Heaven, besides being genuinely respectable, we must also have noble faith, and be willing to fight our own wild nature every day, so that it is under our control. For the sake of maintaining justice, honor, and chastity, we must be willing to give up everything else. The Kingdom of Heaven represents a life of truth and justice. Individual lives and social work must be guided by the qualifications set by Jesus—tolerance, charity, selflessness, and goodwill. Every Sunday, we recite the Lord's Prayer, "Thy kingdom come." Do we truly want God's kingdom to come? Know that God's kingdom cannot fall from the sky, it can only come through our efforts. We must ask ourselves if we have the courage, strength, and will to be citizens of the Kingdom of Heaven? For detailed study, please write to P.O. Box 1227.

### Random Talks on Opera by Hu Qi

— Su Shaoqing

Review of Xi Xiaobo's "The Bird Basin"

Yesterday I listened to Xi Xiaobo perform "The Bird Basin". Xi played Liu Shichang, singing the Xipi Yuanban, the "Sighing at Life" section, the tempo was slightly fast. When singing "The sky changes" to the scattered part, he placed the "changes" character as a narrow, short note at the end of the previous word. Xiaobo's voice is well-developed in the high range, so he is good at producing this sound. The "Traveling" scene is best at this part. The next scene, singing "What a good Zhao Da…" section, he disliked the "exists" being too low, and the "midway" "mid" character being too high, which does not complement the "way" character's low tone. Tonal highs and lows must complement each other, otherwise it's called a "hard mountain range." Although the "mid" character is Yin Ping tone, it does not need to be a high note (gongche notation six), because the "way" character, Yang Ping tone, uses a low tone (gongche notation at the four character), going from six to four is not harmonious. This matter seems small, but its importance is actually great. This is a distinction between the fine and coarse points of musical meter, and it must be paid attention to. Singing the two lines "Yes, yes, I understand", he completely imitated Ma Lianliang's singing style. For those who don't know opera, they may think this sounds good in Lianliang's records. If you listen to the "understand" and "come" characters, Yang Ping tones, they all use Beijing pronunciation, which has a tendency to be reversed. Singing the "Old sir, no need" section is generally very good, the "ba" and "ao" characters are all acceptable, but slightly lacking in fullness. The large section of Fan Erhuang, "Never opened his mouth", the beginning tempo is too fast, "The Lord of Heaven sent down rain," using the old tune's high pitch, is very good. I haven't heard this tune in many years. After "Three years", he adds a large piece of embellishment, but this embellishment is very poor and can be removed. The "cover the face" "face" character embellishment is very sufficient. The "pity me" "pity" character is dragged out for several sections, then the "me" character suddenly becomes very slow. This is a new method invented by Yan Jupeng, and is also not a good example. The "pity" character is sung on the beat, which also does not match the beat position. All the way singing fast "tempo", suddenly "shifting slow" particularly is not allowed by singing rules. This three-character embellishment, the best was Wang Yutian, a Tan school amateur. In short, Xi Xiaobo's beautiful high tone has not reached the age of maturity, so this play lacks sad emotion. In a few more years, with diligent practice, it will not be difficult to reach the pinnacle. At present, it is not appropriate to sing tragedies. If he sings according to Liu Hongsheng's style, "The Execution of His Son", "The Execution of the Yellow Robe", Xiaobo's voice will surely become popular. Using troops requires using one's strengths. I wonder if Xiaobo will listen to my words? (The End)

### Superstitions of Movie Stars

— Lu

Superstition is very common in Hollywood. Almost every star is superstitious, and very peculiar and strange. For example:

Bette Davis likes to shoot the first scene on a rainy day, or shoot a rain scene first; because she won her first Oscar on a rainy day.

Robert Taylor never puts his hat on his bed.

Errol Flynn does not sail or fly on the thirteenth.

Joan Crawford believes old socks can bring her luck.

David Niven is most afraid of broken mirrors.

Werner Moore's makeup box always has a picture of a Jewish pray-er taped inside.

Henry Fonda considers encountering a dwarf an unfavorable omen.

Ann Sheridan always wears a gold chain when filming her first scene, said to be the one she wore when she first appeared on screen.

Hedy Lamarr always stays in bed on the thirteenth and also on Friday.

Patricia Lam is in the past he almost drowned.

Sonja Henie always shoots with old shoelaces.

### Tian Han, Ouyang Yuqian, Wang Bosheng — Recent New Developments

— Haixing

Tian Han recently went from Changsha to Liuzhou, Guangxi. According to him, he is very interested in improving local opera, and has written more than a dozen such scripts in recent years.

In addition to serving as the director of the Guangxi Drama and Music Hall, Ouyang Yuqian was recently hired as the host of the Nanhua Theater, which was established with funding from the provincial government. Construction has already begun, and Ouyang has appointed Li Hua as the manager of the theater. After the theater is established, in addition to staging spoken dramas, it will also stage improved Beijing opera and spoken dramas, it is said.

Chongqing recently established the "Chinese Academy of Arts". The authorities hired Wang Bosheng as the dean, and Wan Laitian is in charge of the drama department.

Old Shu's Jest

### About Sona

— Sheweng

All musical instruments used on stage are indeed tools that control the plot. Whether it is singing or dancing, speaking or acting, being lively or still, everything is helped by the music to express and transform as much as possible. Not only do the performers rely on it for their livelihood, but the audience also does not feel lonely because the music propels the story. Among the instruments, the sona can be said to be the most ancient. Its exciting meaning is actually more powerful than the sheng, xiao, pipe, and flute. In Beijing opera, the sona is sometimes used to play tunes, which insiders call "large characters." Now, however, there is playing but no singing. Most of it has changed from the so-called large characters to being wordless. When I watched the play "Cui Ping Mountain", as Yang Xiong was returning home and his wife was facing him, Yang Xiong suddenly reached out and slapped Qiaoyun's face. At this time, the stage played a short sona sound. If you say that it is also helping the action, it is unavoidable that it is inexplicable, and it does not seem to fully display Yang Xiong's angry emotions. Also, after the slap on Qiaoyun's face, Yang Xiong gave her another slap on the other side. The sona still rang out with the same tone, and it seemed to continue the first half of the tune. But I don't know whether the sona that followed Yang Xiong's hand hitting Qiaoyun's face had singing or not. Who should sing it? What is the meaning of the lyrics? It's all hard to solve. Unless he has a basis for it, that it originated from Kunqu opera or Qinqiang opera, before getting the correct answer, I will always consider it mysterious. For the shallow viewers, they would even think that Pan Qiaoyun's face has vocal cords, a joke.

Reader's Opinion

### Contributing to Film Publications

— Qian Zhenni

Dear Editor: I am a total movie fan. I watch one or two hundred Chinese and foreign movies every year. I also have several hobbies: one is collecting brochures and ticket stubs, and now I even have those from Odeon and Epulo. Another is collecting star photos. Regarding this, I think it's best to have autographed photos, but I regret to say that I have received very few from stars, which shows how difficult it is. A third is widely purchasing film and television publications. From small newspapers to the early film supplements of Shen Bao, I treasure them all. I read in the Entertainment Circle that a comprehensive "China Film News" pictorial weekly will be published before March 22. This is not only good news for me, but probably for all readers. I have the lowest expectations for any film and television publication: First, it must uphold a pure purpose like the "Entertainment Circle". In terms of content, avoid malicious records such as attacks, because this is indirect deception of readers. I hope that each special issue will have interesting and valuable news, and I also hope to have introductions to film songs and trivia. Second, the form must be beautiful. The photos, paper, and printing must all be well-crafted so that readers will permanently save them. Third, it should be able to solicit autographed photos from stars on behalf of readers and give them away, which is what movie fans would most like.

In the midst of the scarcity of Chinese film publications, I hope that you will support the birth of new publications, which will invisibly promote the development of the Chinese film industry. What do you think? Qian Zhenni

(Editor's note) Mr. Zhenni's hopes are indeed very reasonable. I have always hated boring film and drama publications that needlessly attack individuals. This is really an immoral and impure attitude, so this publication has always taken "hiding evil and promoting good" as its duty. Regarding the "China Film News" being launched on the 22nd, it is said to be a very substantial and perfect publication.

Joan Crawford is learning "Tarzan is Coming."

### "Maiden's Lament" on Stage

— Yan

The Zhengyan Art Troupe is newly established. Although it is a new organization, the members are all veterans in the drama circle and drama workers who are familiar to everyone.
