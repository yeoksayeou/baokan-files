Konoe Firmly Declines, Seeking a Secondary Choice

Tokyo - Minister of the Imperial Household Yuasa bears the weighty responsibility of recommending a successor to the Emperor. Therefore, he is soliciting opinions from all sides, considering Prince Fumimaro Konoe as the number one candidate. He is earnestly requesting Konoe to come forward and resolve the current situation. However, Konoe's mindset remains unchanged, forcing the work of selecting a successor to the premiership to consider a second step. (Fourteenth, Domei News Agency)

Tokyo - Minister of the Imperial Household Yuasa convened a meeting of senior statesmen in the palace at 11:00 AM this morning to inquire about their intentions. As a result, it was decided to recommend Military Councilor and Navy Admiral Mitsumasa Yonai to form a cabinet.

Abe's Statement Explaining Reasons for Resignation

Tokyo - This morning, Abe issued the following statement to reporters: "Since forming the cabinet last August, I have strived to handle domestic and foreign affairs, with the handling of the China Incident as the main objective. However, it has become apparent that opinions regarding the implementation of the government's established policies and plans have not been consistent. Therefore, I have submitted the resignation of the entire cabinet to the Emperor in order to avoid a standstill in the government during this critical time and to prevent possible repercussions in the handling of the China Incident, which has entered its first phase." (Fourteenth, Reuters)

Speculation on Political Trends of the New Cabinet

Tokyo - The sudden appointment of General Mitsumasa Yonai to the premiership has surprised most people. Yonai had previously served as Navy Minister in the cabinets of Kiichiro Hiranuma and Prince Fumimaro Konoe. Within the Abe Nobuyuki cabinet, the navy already had three members, wielding considerable influence. Now, instead of appointing Army Minister Hata Shunroku to form the cabinet, Yonai has been chosen as Prime Minister, making it easy to predict one or two political trends. Sources in Tokyo point out that the Japanese Navy is attempting to seek understanding with Britain and the United States, paying particular attention to the United States. They also note that Japanese newspapers had not mentioned Yonai as a candidate for successor to the premiership until this morning, which seems to be significant. (Fourteenth, Haitong News Agency)

Tokyo - According to tonight's news, the Emperor has appointed Navy Admiral Mitsumasa Yonai to form the succeeding cabinet. The previous report that General Hata Shunroku had been ordered to form the cabinet has proven to be inaccurate. The Abe cabinet, following Konoe and Hiranuma, shouldered the heavy responsibility of continuing to strengthen the wartime economy of a quasi-totalitarian state. Due to the lack of achievement and mismanagement of the various cabinet members, people of all classes, including capitalists, industrialists, bureaucrats, politicians, and the general public, have become increasingly dissatisfied. The Abe cabinet was thus forced to resign after a majority of members of the House of Representatives declared their opposition. If the Abe cabinet had used the means of dissolving the Diet to suppress the opposition, the passage of the massive one billion yen budget would have been significantly delayed. There are also many indications that the results of the general election would show the opposition to the cabinet in the House of Representatives to be even stronger than it is now. The entire nation of Japan now expects a strong and extraordinary statesman to emerge and correct the mistakes of the previous three cabinets. (Fourteenth, Reuters)

Chongqing's Observation of the Japanese Political Situation

Chongqing - According to Chinese sources familiar with the Japanese political situation, the new Japanese cabinet that will follow the Abe cabinet will inevitably be a military junta. Its power will inevitably be greater than that of the bureaucratic regime that has resigned. The Japanese Abe cabinet was the weakest and most useless cabinet of the Japanese wartime cabinets. The complexion of the new cabinet will inevitably tend more towards young military personnel, and thus its military actions against China will inevitably become more aggressive. The weakness of the Abe cabinet lies in its incompetence. Although there was no shortage of "American experts" such as Kaku Murata and Admiral Nomura Kichisaburo in the Abe cabinet, relations between Japan and the United States ultimately failed to improve and could only await the expiration of the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation. At the same time, the Abe cabinet also failed to promote relations between the Soviet Union and Japan. In fact, since the outbreak of the European war, due to the increased friendship between the Soviet Union and Germany, there was a good opportunity to improve Soviet-Japanese relations, but Abe missed this opportunity. Furthermore, Abe failed to resolve the "China Incident" and failed to establish Wang Jingwei's "rule" at an early date. The only achievement of the Abe cabinet was the conclusion of the Soviet-Japanese Fisheries Agreement, but in general, this agreement was purely technical and not very important. Domestically, Abe faced two major difficulties: (1) The rice riots in major and minor cities in Japan, which showed the economic difficulties in Japan, and (2) the collective resignation of officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which has completely destroyed the dignity of the Abe cabinet. In the end, the new government that arises in Japan will inevitably be a more powerful military junta, but if Japan's military actions against China become more aggressive, China's resistance to Japan will inevitably become stronger.

### Brief Biography of Yonai

Tokyo - The new Prime Minister Yonai is currently sixty years old and is from Iwate Prefecture. He graduated from the Naval Academy in the 34th year of Meiji (1901) and later became a naval ensign. He progressively rose in rank, reaching the rank of naval vice admiral in the 5th year of Showa (1930). During that time, he served as the captain of various warships such as the "Kasuga," "Iwate," "Fuso," and "Mutsu." He also served as the Chief of Staff of the Second Fleet, the Commander of the Chinkai Naval Base, the Commander of the First Overseas Expeditionary Fleet, assigned to the Naval General Staff, the Commander of the Third Fleet, the Commander of the Sasebo Naval Base, and the Commander of the Combined Fleet. He assumed the position of Navy Minister when the Hayashi cabinet was formed in the 12th year of Showa (1937). He later became a Military Councilor until today. (Fourteenth, Domei News Agency)

### Various Sectors in Japan Place High Hopes on the New Cabinet; Establishing Domestic Order Is Considered a Matter of Urgent Necessity

Tokyo - This morning, newspapers generally advocated the formation of a strong cabinet that not only enjoys the trust of the Imperial Court but also the support of the people. Most newspapers strongly argued that the new cabinet should prioritize domestic affairs, especially those concerning agriculture and industry, as this is necessary for waging a long-term war. The "Asahi Shimbun" stated that the new cabinet should first establish domestic order, otherwise any attempt at foreign policy in Manchuria will inevitably fail. (Fourteenth, Haitong News Agency)

Tokyo - The Japanese industrial sector has shown extremely favorable feelings towards the emergence of the Yonai cabinet. The issues that remain are which figures will be in charge of the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. However, if one infers from the personality of General Yonai and the forces behind him, the policies will definitely be fairly stable. Therefore, various parties are very eager to cooperate with the political parties in handling foreign affairs and assisting the new cabinet in managing rear-area matters. Here is a summary of the hopes of the financial community for the Yonai cabinet: (1) The first problem to solve is restoring the political authority lost by the previous cabinet. (2) Domestic economic controls regarding price issues and materials issues should be properly managed with responsibility. (3) Regarding foreign affairs, especially trade policies, it is imperative to respect the full opinions of private sector operators to ensure smooth operation. (Fourteenth, Domei News Agency)

### A Review of Abe's Achievements After Four and a Half Months in Power

Japanese Prime Minister Kiichiro Hiranuma, due to his policy of strengthening the Anti-Comintern Pact, felt uneasy in his position after Hitler turned his back on Japan and approached the Soviet Union. General Abe took the stage on August 30 of last year, assuming the position of Prime Minister. This was one week after the Soviet Union and Germany concluded an agreement, and two days after the outbreak of the European War. General Abe had no notable reputation and had been retired for three years. People generally believed that because he had been living in seclusion for so long, he would have no grudges or enemies, and his cabinet formation would not cause much controversy. In addition, the military supported him, and he was related to Prince Konoe's confidant, Marquis Kido (his eldest son married the Marquis's daughter). All of these were favorable conditions for forming a cabinet at the time. This is the story of how General Abe came to be appointed Prime Minister.

Only Achievement at the Beginning of His Tenure

At the beginning of his tenure, he temporarily held the position of Foreign Minister while also being Prime Minister, and on September 5, he issued a statement that Japan would not participate in the European War. Subsequently, on September 16, a cease-fire agreement was reached with the Soviet Union regarding the Nomonhan Incident. All of this was welcomed by Japanese public opinion. Especially in the case of the Nomonhan Incident, as a result of repeated clashes between Japanese and Soviet forces, a total of 18,000 Japanese soldiers were killed. This was only announced by the Japanese government on October 4.

Military Failure: A Major Blow

Prime Minister Abe then appointed Navy Admiral Kichisaburo Nomura as Foreign Minister on October 23 to strengthen the cabinet. He then adopted a "three-pronged offensive": Firstly, a military offensive against China. The Japanese army began attacking Changsha, but never entered the city. Later, the Japanese side explained that there was no intention to do so, only to "punish" the Chinese army. Secondly, a domestic offensive. Prime Minister Abe, in view of the fact that the Army and Navy Ministers had the right to directly meet with the Emperor at any time to report on various cabinet affairs, which allowed them to compete with the Prime Minister within the cabinet, attempted to reform the system and abolish this right. However, the results were never announced. It is said that restrictions were only placed on the handling of the "China Incident." Regarding other public affairs, the Army and Navy Ministers could still enter the palace at any time. Thirdly, an offensive against bureaucratic politics. Prime Minister Abe, disregarding the opposition of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, attempted to establish a Ministry of Commerce, which led to a unified opposition from all officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who resisted by "diplomatic slowdown." After several days, on October 13, the Abe cabinet finally yielded. Its weakness and incompetence were thus fully exposed. After suffering repeated failures in the above three offensives, the Abe cabinet switched to a defensive posture, but various blows continued to follow.

No Achievements in Diplomacy or Domestic Affairs

U.S. Ambassador to Japan Joseph Grew delivered a speech at the American Club in Tokyo on October 19 of last year, warning Japan that what U.S. public opinion expected was "facts, not empty words." This was the first blow suffered by the Abe cabinet. Subsequently, the leaders of the two major political parties, the Seiyukai and Minseito, refused to join the cabinet on November 21. This was the second blow. However, it is generally believed that the main reason for the deterioration of the political situation was domestic economic instability. For example, some areas of Japan were facing rice shortages, and in the northern regions, Kyushu, and Korea, there were even rumors of rice riots. In addition, there was also a shortage of charcoal, a daily necessity for Japanese families. It is said that the insufficient supply of both rice and charcoal was not due to a fundamental lack of supply, but to uneven distribution. As a result, rice prices soared, and the general public was greatly shaken. The public believed that the cabinet's policy of trying to suppress the prices of various necessities had failed. The cabinet initially claimed to suppress prices, but then, unable to suppress them, changed to stabilizing prices at the current level. In the end, however, it was unable to stabilize them and changed to revising prices according to "fair standards." In addition, the budget passed on December 8 of last year, totaling over one trillion yen, was an unprecedentedly large budget. It is expected that in order to cope with this huge expenditure, the government will inevitably raise tax rates and continue to pursue inflationary policies.

Attempts to Reverse the Decline Ultimately Unsuccessful

When the House of Representatives reconvened on December 26, over 200 members of various parties passed a resolution in an informal meeting, demanding Abe's resignation. Although Japanese political parties have not held a decisive position in national political life for the past ten years, the actions of these members were sufficient to prove that the general public was increasingly dissatisfied with the weakness and incompetence of the Abe cabinet. Under these circumstances, the Abe cabinet attempted to make a final struggle in diplomacy in order to reverse the decline, but was ultimately unsuccessful. For example, on December 31 of last year, the Japanese government concluded a temporary agreement with the Soviet Union on the fisheries issue, thereby showing that the two countries were adjusting their relations. This was one thing. The Japanese government announced the opening of the lower Yangtze River in order to appease U.S. public opinion and pave the way for improving relations between the two sides. This was another thing. However, the tense domestic political situation did not ease as a result. Furthermore, in terms of military affairs, although the Japanese army had captured Nanning City in Guangxi Province, China, several weeks ago, it did nothing to stabilize the cabinet's position.

After the beginning of the new year, government authorities held meetings with representatives of the Japanese army stationed in China (Lieutenant General Itagaki Seishiro, Chief of Staff of the Expeditionary Army, also flew back to Tokyo from China to participate). They discussed the "Wang Jingwei New Regime." However, after the completion of these preliminary talks, Army Minister Hata Shunroku, the spokesman for the military, publicly stated that the military hoped that the Prime Minister would resign. The Abe cabinet therefore finally collapsed. (Havas News Agency)

Editorial

### Abe's Fall and Japanese Politics

The Japanese Abe cabinet finally proved unable to sustain itself and carried out a collective resignation yesterday morning. It has been difficult to select a successor to the premiership. It was not until late last night that it was learned that former Navy Minister Yonai had been ordered to form a cabinet. Whether the new cabinet can be successfully formed, what the lineup of cabinet members will be, and what policy direction it will take are all unknown. Since China launched its full-scale resistance, Japan has changed its prime minister four times. The Konoe cabinet lasted the longest, for nineteen months. The Hiranuma cabinet was very brief, lasting eight months. The Abe cabinet was formed on August 30 of last year, and lasted only four and a half months, an extremely short cabinet tenure.

The fall of the Konoe cabinet was due to the failure of the peace offensive against China. The fall of the Hiranuma cabinet was mainly due to strengthening the anti-communist pact of Germany, Italy and Japan, but ultimately being betrayed by Germany. As for Abe, his fall is almost bewildering and bizarre. It is still remembered that at the beginning of Abe's ascent to power, we once commented on his essence based on the clues he revealed, calling him "unprecedentedly poor and empty." Regarding his hopes, we judged him to be "inherently deficient from birth and imbalanced later in life, unable to accomplish anything and without any future prospects. He can be said to have been doomed from the moment he was born." Now, upon examination, we are secretly glad that our previous comments were somewhat accurate. Abe achieved nothing and had no solutions for Japan's military actions against China, its international diplomacy, or its domestic economy. Compared to the general situation four or five months ago, everything in Japan today has only deteriorated. However, there are things that cannot be completely dismissed. During the Hiranuma cabinet, Japan was loudly boasting about joining forces with Germany and Italy to constrain Britain and France. When Germany engaged with the Soviet Union, Japan was suddenly isolated internationally. Abe succeeded him, and less than twenty days later, the Soviet-Japanese Nomonhan ceasefire agreement was signed, and recently, the Soviet-Japanese fisheries issue was resolved. This was something Hiranuma was unable to do, but Abe achieved it through effort. However, given Japan's international environment in the past four or five months, Germany launched a large-scale invasion of Poland, Britain and France declared war to assist Poland and restrain Germany, the Soviet Union was determined to act in Northern Europe, the world was in turmoil, and the United States was reserved. This was truly an excellent environment for Japan to change course, extricate itself from the quagmire, compensate through trade, and restore its international position. However, it was unable to come up with a plan and ultimately ended up as it is today. Is it not due to those who bear the heavy responsibility of the nation to shoulder the nation's reliance? Regarding the Soviet border disputes and fisheries issues, matters of the utmost insignificance, it is more accurate to say that the Soviet Union granted them to Abe.

It was inevitable that Abe would not be able to remain in his position for long due to his inherent and acquired poverty and emptiness. However, it is not in accordance with the usual course of events for him to collapse at this moment. Why is this said? If the collapse was in response to the general international situation, then the European War broke out just two days after Abe formed his cabinet. This was something Abe could not have anticipated when he was ordered to form his cabinet. It would have been an unusual but not extraordinary event to reorganize the cabinet at that time to adapt to the dramatic changes. If the collapse was in response to the U.S.-Japan antagonism, then it was generally known that there was a five-month distance between Abe's formation of the cabinet and the expiration of the treaty. There was ample time to seek a remedy. Now, with only ten days left before the expiration, this is precisely an important moment for countries and politicians with firm national policies to solemnly prepare for the event. Why did Abe procrastinate until the last day? If the collapse was in response to the so-called "China Incident" in Japan, the essence of Japan's policy of establishing a so-called new central government is not worth discussing here. However, Japan has claimed that this is an immutable policy, so why did the prime minister leave a few days after deciding on these "conditions"? In short, although the Abe cabinet was said to be a cabinet with no prospects from the beginning, its fall today is all the more perplexing because it fell without knowing its main cause. This type of cabinet tide is unprecedented in the political history of Japan and other countries.

Examining Abe's final statement, there is a sentence that says, "I have made handling the China Incident the main goal, but there has been no consensus on the opinions regarding the implementation of the government's established policies and plans, which is now apparent." Therefore, he has resigned to avoid possible repercussions. Thus, one might speculate that the collapse of the Abe cabinet was only a technical issue under the policy of handling the so-called China Incident. However, is that credible? Abe's "policy of handling the China Incident" was based on the Konoe Declaration. Abe was unable to win, only Konoe could. While Abe was on the verge of collapse, Konoe was the only one whom the Japanese military, government, and public unanimously respected. Therefore, Konoe had a duty that he could not shirk! However, Konoe declined, saying, "I believe that my economic knowledge is insufficient to be of assistance. My conscience dictates that I am unable to assume the heavy responsibility of resolving the current situation. Moreover, the future political situation will not be based on lineage." Thus, it can be seen that the problem is not a technical issue of promoting the policy towards China, nor is it only a problem of the policy towards China. The problem is in the economy, which seems close to the truth. However, 260 Diet members pressured Abe based on the hardships of the people they had witnessed in various regions, but Abe remained unmoved. He was ultimately forced to leave because of one word from Army Minister Hata Shunroku. Abe's successor is not an economic authority, but Navy Admiral Yonai. Therefore, the economy is still not the main theme, which is even more perplexing?

Due to the above reasons, it is said that Abe's fall is bewildering and bizarre. What is so strange about it? He failed to measure his own abilities, and recklessly engaged in military aggression for two and a half years, resulting in exhaustion of strength, depletion of wealth, fatigue of troops, and resentment among the people. He knew that he could not continue and that he had to fundamentally change his national policy. However, he was misled by the exaggerated education of the past and the false propaganda of past years, leading the lower levels of the military and civilians astray, making it difficult to reverse course. However, there is no statesman with great knowledge and courage who dares to bear the resentment of the moment and forcefully correct the wrongs of aggression. Heavy members are only struggling in the dead end of military, diplomatic, and economic matters. Is their hesitation and sorrow any different?

### German Forces to Launch Offensive on the Western Front Within Three Months; Willing to Attack Neutral Countries If Necessary; German Troops Along the Dutch Border Deploying Northward

London - Lord Milner, a member of Parliament, recently published an article in the Sunday Chronicle, stating that within the next three months, Hitler will launch a nationwide offensive on the Western Front in order to break through the lines of Britain and France. If necessary, he will not hesitate to attack neutral countries. In order to overcome current difficulties, Hitler must launch a large-scale offensive as soon as possible. If he delays, he will inevitably lose the opportunity completely. In other words, Hitler must achieve a military victory or he will be unable to save himself. Therefore, he has no other good strategy than to take a gamble. (Fourteenth, Havas)

Rotterdam - According to German sources cited in a report from the Dutch border by a Rotterdam newspaper, Germany is currently imposing large-scale restrictions on domestic passenger trains. This move is likely a sign of major military activity. According to the general expectation of the German people, military action will definitely occur once the weather clears. The concentration of German troops along the Dutch border, which used to be limited to the vicinity of Coesfeld, is now extending northward. Therefore, the town of Gronau in Westphalia is full of German troops, and the town's train station is now closed to trains. The German people are showing anxiety and unease because German newspapers and radio stations are not publishing important world news. (Fourteenth, Reuters)

The Hague - Due to the concentration of German troops along the Dutch border, the Dutch military authorities have decided to issue an order to cancel all leave for officers and soldiers, and those who are currently on leave are being recalled. (Fourteenth, Havas)

The Hague - In recent days, German troops have moved closer to the Netherlands, and German aircraft have also violated Dutch airspace. The Dutch army yesterday deployed to important strongholds in the Nijmegen area to prevent any eventuality.

London - The Sunday Chronicle recently reported that German leader Hitler has formulated a plan with Foreign Minister Ribbentrop regarding the country's "war aims." In essence, these are the peace terms that the country intends to propose to Britain and France after its eventual victory. The detailed contents will be announced in a short period of time. In general, there are six points: (1) Britain and France should cede all of their colonies in Africa to Germany. (2) France should cede the provinces of Alsace and Lorraine to Germany. (3) Britain and France should pay Germany a large indemnity, totaling 400 billion pounds. (4) Britain should sign a commercial treaty with Germany that includes a most-favored-nation clause, which should also apply to their respective colonies, including India. (5) Britain and France should grant Germany certain special concessions in finance, so as to ensure that Germany maintains political and economic dominance. (6) France should sign an alliance treaty with Germany for a term of 25 years. (Fourteenth, Havas)

### 法海長陳述　協約國海上戰績　商業獲得自由　使德海外貿易銷滅於無形　德警告中立船勿受英護送

Paris. The French Minister of the Navy, Guesthart, yesterday published an article describing the remarkable achievements of the Allied Powers at sea in the four months since the start of the war, stating that the Allied Powers have achieved freedom for their commerce and rendered German overseas trade virtually extinct. Furthermore, 400 German ships dare not leave neutral ports. The French Navy alone has sunk 10 German submarines, inspected 239 merchant ships, and intercepted 622,000 tons of goods bound for Germany. Apart from the Baltic Sea, Allied routes are completely open as usual. Large armies have arrived from the colonies without a single loss. Over 1,300 Allied ships and more than 200 merchant convoys have safely crossed the sea under the escort of French warships. The Allied Powers have collectively sunk approximately 30 German submarines, and French warships have suffered no losses. A total of 11 French merchant ships have been lost, 7 of which were sunk by German submarines. The number of losses is approximately 2% of the total number of French merchant ships in September. French shipyards are currently actively building 126 warships. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)

London. British fishing boats have been repeatedly attacked by Germans during the past week, with as many as six sunk. According to the secretary of the North Sea Fishing Boat Industry Association, British fishing boats are generally unarmed. Due to this cowardly act by the enemy, they have requested the government to arm each vessel for use in times of necessity. Also, the fishing boat "Flavia" has returned to a port in Scotland after being attacked by a German aircraft en route. The German aircraft strafed with machine guns from 50 feet above, followed by dropping nine bombs, all of which missed. There were no casualties on board. (Associated Press dispatch, 14th)

Berlin. The German Foreign Office mouthpiece, "Deutsche Aussenpolitische Revue", warned neutral ships today, stating that if neutral ships are influenced by British propaganda and escorted by British warships, they will automatically become participating units and may encounter the danger of war. This is a trick by Britain to drag neutral countries into the European war, and it is hoped that all neutral countries will be careful not to fall into their trap.

### 日對外貿易　畸形發展　對「非日金集團」　仍居於入超地位

Tokyo. According to official statistics released a few days ago, Japan's foreign trade increased significantly last year, totaling 7,006 million Japanese Yen, an increase of 23% compared to the previous year. Imports increased by 10% compared to the previous year, and exports increased by 36%. The total surplus was 800 million Japanese Yen, an increase of 740 million Japanese Yen compared to the previous year's surplus. However, according to experts, although the surplus is large, not all of it can actually be converted into foreign currency. This is because Japan's foreign trade partners must be divided into two different groups: one is the "Yen Bloc", including "Manchukuo" and the occupied areas of China, and the other is the "Non-Yen Bloc". Japan's trade with the countries of the "Non-Yen Bloc" can be called "true foreign trade". If we analyze the overall trade situation of Japan last year, most of the imported goods came from these countries, while the exports of Japanese goods to these countries accounted for more than half of the total. In other words, Japan actually had a trade deficit of approximately 500 million Japanese Yen with the countries of the "Non-Yen Bloc". From this, it can be seen that although Japan has an overall trade surplus, it still has a trade deficit with the countries of the "Non-Yen Bloc". It is naturally conceivable that it cannot fully exchange export goods for foreign currency. Furthermore, the main reason for the surge in Japan's foreign trade last year was the high global prices. Often, the trading volume of certain goods did not increase, but due to soaring prices, the total value increased sharply compared to the past. For example, the export volume of Japanese silk last year, calculated in terms of quantity, actually increased by 20%. The same is true for Japan's import of raw cotton. In addition, the Japanese government's strict control of the domestic economy has been quite effective in improving the trade balance, because the government has made every effort to limit domestic consumption in order to export more goods abroad. (Havas dispatch, 13th)

Washington Shipping News. The Department of Commerce recently announced that the manufacturers of rayon in Japan relied on the countries of the Scandinavian Peninsula for the supply of fibers. Due to the European war, they have switched to purchasing from the United States. It is also reported that the Japanese rayon industry has obtained government approval to order 30,000 tons from the United States and Canada. The deepening dependence of the Japanese economy on the United States due to the impact of the European war can be clearly demonstrated here. (Havas Agency)

### 美國民衆　反日情緒強烈　美日商務談判無法進行　此後將入於無條約狀態

Chongqing. According to the English-language Chu Pao here today, the people of the United States are all demanding a ban on the export of military supplies to Japan. Therefore, the US Congress should not delay this matter any further. Public sentiment in the United States is extremely strongly opposed to Japanese aggression. At the same time, we are even more confident that after the expiration of the US-Japan commercial treaty, the United States will take more active measures to end the war. (Associated Press dispatch, 13th)

Washington. The "Army and Navy Journal" stated in an article yesterday that the resignation of the Japanese Abe Cabinet also brought an end to the talks on the US-Japan commercial treaty. US-Japan trade will henceforth be conducted under conditions where neither party has treaty obligations. Japanese goods exported to the US will be subject to additional fees until Japan agrees to abide by the Nine-Power Treaty. (Associated Press dispatch, 14th)

Tokyo. Professor Ouchi and two associate professors from Tokyo Imperial University, along with 17 so-called radicals, were arrested on December 1, 1937, for violating the Public Security Preservation Law. Recently, the preliminary judge determined that the charges were confirmed, and they will be publicly tried by the Tokyo District Criminal Court. These people are so-called People's Front movement members. It is said that this movement is centered on the Japan Labor Party and labor unions. At the time of the arrest, there were a total of 400 people, and Professor Ouchi and 20 others were the most important. (Havas dispatch, 13th)

Congressman Betts of Kentucky told the Associated Press reporter yesterday that this move by the Navy will allow the House to completely re-examine the situation of the Navy. Although he personally supports the Guam reinforcement plan, some members of the Naval Affairs Committee have suggested that the Guam reinforcement plan be submitted to the River and Harbor Committee instead of the Navy Department.

### 美遠東政策的透視

Since the Soviet Union and Japan signed a truce agreement last September, and then Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov in October Revolution Anniversary speech said pro-Japanese, Japan and the Soviet Union will be conducted business negotiations, rampant, the United States for the Far East situation because it is becoming increasingly concerned, the general concern people from the inquiry, the Far East of the Soviet Union and Japan is as good as the Nazi and Soviet countries, carve up China, Guoer then the Open Door policy and traditional U.S. interests will be how.

The U.S. government at least has made it clear that any rights in China, will not frankly automatically give up. The United States will not be for these rights war, but in the "war outside" there are other ways to express indignation. This month on the 26th, the U.S. and Japan commercial treaty will expire, and now have not taken concrete steps to negotiate a new commercial treaty or interim measures. The implication is that, by the 26th of this month, Japan will not enjoy U.S. Secretary of State Hull and twenty-two countries ordered reciprocal trade agreement provides the tax cuts. Its own meaning a kind of punishment, Congress and the majority of members advocated the passage of a ban on arms and raw materials to Japan bill, this action in the U.S. and Japan existing commercial treaty abolished after the can be legally implemented. The State Department has also decided attitude, the United States rights in China Gou not get protection, that is, not with Japan to negotiate a new commercial treaty. The U.S. position in China has long been the United States and China legitimate government signed various treaties various agreements, be confirmed, not to recognize the third party Japan has the right to change or modify.

U.S. to Japan's attitude will not because the Soviet Union and to the Far East attention and the slightest soft. Japan and the Soviet Union's every move, the United States is regarded as a jackal of the same burrow. The U.S. government authorities condemn the Soviet Union is with condemnation of Nazi Germany as severe. The three countries there is nothing great understanding, but in the U.S. eyes, are in violation of international law of the country. The United States is not willing in the three countries, pull one to contain the other. The U.S. for the Far East situation can be said to no longer be in maintaining balance. Previously the U.S. often help Russia to contain Japan, or to help Japan to contain Russia. The U.S. in 1933 recognized the Soviet Union is also contained meaning of Japan. The two countries Gou there is a country too strong, the U.S. often against the country developed. In 1899, Russia's economic influence into Manchuria, is to promote the Open Door policy is a main reason. Until the last war after the United States sent troops to Siberia is to curb Japan's ambitions. The U.S. history for the two countries Japan and Russia is that so. Now have this traditional policy abandoned. By recently, the Soviet Union for Finland's attitude, the United States both sternly condemned, the Soviet Union's newspapers also counter each other. The Soviet Union Embassy in the United States celebrated the October Revolution Anniversary, U.S. Cabinet and senators surprisingly no one participated, only by the State Department Soviet Division sent a second to attend perfunctorily, the U.S. dissatisfaction with the Soviet Union's emotions is evident.

If the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany relations, the United States is to note the Soviet Union and Japan relations, rather than for the Soviet Union and Germany relations, but also recognize the two sides not without parallel the original element exist in it. U.S. Undersecretary of State Mays Smith recently reviewed foreign policy, although not referred to the Soviet Union, but the Far East will be a detailed statement. He addressed the Washington Treaty would say, "in recent years, these treaties have been because of the Far East of the unfortunate events suffered significant impact. The U.S. government still be obliged to abide by these treaties of the objectives, the spirit and the provisions ...... any revision must be based on these treaties of the original text, taking into account U.S. interests, in accordance with international law of the procedures established to do, can not be by any country of unilateral actions out of it ...... domestic part of the people advocated the U.S. foreign policy of the basic principles temporarily shelved, until the rapidly changing international situation after stable and then set advance and retreat. International stage of the new combination or not to need our country policy revision overhaul. I for this claim dare firmly answer, other countries between what combination, the U.S. nation will never give up its basic principles ...... foreign group what change, the U.S. will never revoke the international relations should be in order progress of the claim." However, the United States is prepared to be the advocate for the judge, but is not willing to be the executor. This layer, Mays Smith Undersecretary has also been added to the description.

### 蔣委員長夫婦購買　節約建國儲蓄券　潘公展談節約儲蓄之正確性

Chongqing. Because the "Frugality and Nation-Building Savings Certificates" are currently being widely promoted, which is directly related to the needs of people's livelihood adjustment and indirectly helps the completion of national construction undertakings, Chairman Chiang and his wife recently purchased savings certificates for several thousand yuan respectively to demonstrate their advocacy. (14th dispatch)

Chongqing. Pan Gongzhan, Deputy Minister of the Central Propaganda Department and Standing Committee Member of the National Frugality and Nation-Building Savings Movement Committee, recently spoke to reporters about the correctness of frugality and savings. According to him, the government's establishment of "Frugality and Nation-Building Savings" during the Anti-Japanese War and Nation-Building period has two functions: (1) In a passive sense, it can cultivate national habits of thrift and frugality, and economize on waste, as a preparation for the improvement of personal and family life. (2) In an active sense, frugality can create capital consumption for production, improve the national economy, and strengthen the power of the Anti-Japanese War. Last year, the government promulgated "Frugality and Nation-Building Savings", designating the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Farmers Bank, and Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau to handle it. Other public and private banks that are guaranteed by the Ministry of Finance can also handle it. Currently, the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank, as well as the trust bureau of the Central Bank, have all opened for business. It is said that the results are still good. As for the "Frugality and Nation-Building Savings Certificates", the government has promulgated regulations, designating the Central Trust Bureau, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Farmers Bank, and the Postal Savings Bureau to handle them. This savings certificate originated in the United States. During the last European war, it was called "War Savings Certificate" and was the best method for promoting small-amount savings. In the United Kingdom at that time, the effect was very good, absorbing an amount of 300 to 400 million pounds, which was extremely effective for wartime economy and stabilizing the post-war economy. Our country is imitating it, which is of great significance. This savings certificate has now been issued by the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, and the Central Trust Bureau has also prepared for it. It is said that it will also be issued within this month, and the Central Bank has been requested to allocate an independent fund of 10 million yuan as a guarantee. The other three banks, the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank, are also preparing to issue them. This savings certificate is absolutely different in nature from various public bonds and various securities. Its principal and interest can be repaid in a short period of time. On the national level, under the principle of fulfilling responsibility and serving the country, we enjoy the preferential rights of savings. On the national level, we can concentrate funds and use them for various construction undertakings. This is the correctness of frugality and nation-building, and it is an unprecedented and excellent opportunity in our country's history. We deeply hope that the people of the country will not easily miss it. (14th dispatch)

### Close Cooperation Between German and Soviet Troops on Polish Border Arouses French Attention

Paris, according to reliable French sources, there is now close cooperation between the German and Soviet military authorities in the Ukrainian region of Poland. This is currently receiving a great deal of attention here. News from Germany about Germany possibly mediating the Soviet-Finnish war has led people here to question whether this German suggestion is aimed at getting the Soviet Union to abandon northwestern Europe and shift its activities to the southwest. Until recently, the Soviet army had been exclusively guarding certain parts of Poland, preventing Germany from establishing a common border with Romania. The export of Romanian oil to Germany was therefore difficult. But at present, German troops have entered the Ukrainian region of Poland, and a German military mission is also active in Moscow. Therefore, people here believe that this is a sign of close German-Soviet military cooperation. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)

Therefore, the government is taking defense measures in order to eliminate public anxiety. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)

### Chinese Troops in Southern Guangxi Intensify Siege of Japanese Troops in Nanning, Japanese Wounded and Heavy Weapons Withdraw South to Liuzhou, Eight Japanese Aircraft Shot Down

Guilin correspondence, the Japanese invasion of southern Guangxi is actually related to the invasions of northern Hunan and northern Guangdong. It is because the Japanese wanted to lure the Chinese army to aid Guangxi, and then carry out a large-scale plan in northern Guangdong and northern Hunan. This has been seen through by the Chinese army, which responded separately. The Japanese army in northern Hunan did not dare to come again, and the Japanese army in northern Guangdong also collapsed completely. The Chinese army in southern Guangxi intensified its counter-offensive against Nanning, determined to eliminate the main force of the Japanese army. Since the counter-offensive from various directions, the mechanical units and the new air force have contributed greatly, so the battle situation is recorded as follows:

Siege of Nanning

Since the Chinese army recaptured the Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth Ponds, the Japanese army repeatedly launched counter-attacks on the Fifth and Sixth Ponds. After being met with a head-on attack by the Chinese army, the Japanese army was defeated and retreated south. The Chinese army followed and pursued, capturing more than 400 Japanese officers and soldiers, who have been sent to a certain unit in the rear. The Japanese army in Shanxu was fiercely besieged by the Chinese army. After a day and night of fierce fighting, more than half of them had been annihilated by the Chinese army. The remaining were defeated and fled in panic. On the evening of December 28, the Chinese army launched a fierce attack on the Luotang Fortress, and captured the Luotang Fortress that night. The Japanese army in Kunlun Pass lost their barrier, and the Chinese army continued to advance. Hundreds of Japanese cavalry to the west of Kunlun Pass once tried to break through desperately on the 27th, but were chased by the Chinese army and collapsed in panic, leaving more than 50 bodies behind. The Chinese army seized more than 30 military horses and many important documents. According to reports, there are only more than 4,000 Japanese troops in the area north of the Yong River, and about 1,000 in Gaofeng, who are constantly attacked by the Chinese army, so casualties are often more than 60%. For several days, the Japanese army in Nanning has been withdrawing heavy weapons, ammunition, and food to the south bank of the Yu River. On the 28th, they also withdrew 20 artillery pieces from Nanning across the river along the highway towards Xiaodong. At the same time, the Japanese army around Nanning has been repeatedly attacked by the Chinese army, suffering heavy casualties. According to inquiries, more than 3,000 Japanese wounded are being transported from Nanning to Xiaodong. Except for a small number of seriously injured, who use stretchers, the rest are walking with injuries, traversing the mountains in great pain. Many people died along the way.

Chinese Aircraft Assist in Battle

The Chinese army's counter-offensive against Nanning this time was greatly aided by the air force. The Chinese aircraft currently stationed in Guangxi are giving the Japanese army a major blow at any time. The Chinese aircraft have been sending teams to sweep the remaining Japanese troops in Kunlun Pass and Jiutang, providing great help to the Chinese army's ground attack units. The Chinese army has now completely eliminated the Japanese troops in western Kunlun and is flying to the front to assist the troops continuing to advance westward.

Japanese Army Flees Westward

The Chinese army's continuous and fierce counter-offensive is unstoppable. The Japanese army divided into two groups and fled westward from Sile, attempting to occupy Longzhou. The defending troops in that area gave them a head-on attack. At the same time, in order to annihilate the Japanese army in that area, the Chinese army dispatched another elite force to detour and pursue. After two days of fierce fighting, more than 1,000 Japanese troops in Sile were completely surrounded and annihilated, capturing more than 700 rifles, more than 40 light machine guns, several small steel cannons, and countless ammunition and horses, and capturing two colonels. Sile has now been completely recovered by the Chinese army. As for the vanguard of the Japanese army attempting to disturb Longzhou by fleeing westward, their rear was cut off, and they were met with a head-on attack by the Chinese army. They were panicked and fled back, attempting to break through Sile to avoid being annihilated.

Air Battle Over Liuzhou

At 1:30 PM on December 30, 18 Japanese Type 96 fighter planes attempted to invade Liuzhou. The Chinese air force heard the news and took off from various locations, surrounding them from all directions and launching a fierce attack. Although the Japanese planes charged left and right, they had no chance to escape. After about 15 minutes of fighting, the remaining Japanese planes could not hold on and fled in panic. As a result, the Chinese army shot down a total of eight Japanese planes. Two have been found, killing one Japanese aviator, Cheng Tianbo, who belonged to the Japanese Navy's 14th Air Corps. His clothing was made in Sasebo and the British naval port. In addition, many scattered personal belongings and amulets from Mount Kominato were obtained. The remains of the other Japanese planes are being searched by various local agencies. It has been found that one is in Dalongtan, five miles from Liuzhou, and the fuselage is completely destroyed. The other is in Labao, five miles from Liuzhou. The pilot parachuted to escape, but was shot dead by the Chinese army.

### Unstable Situation in Wuxi, Disturbance Continues After Assassination of Puppet Governor

Wuxi correspondence, after the puppet governor Yang Shoutong was assassinated, the disturbance in the city has not ended. At the same time, Yang's guard, Zhang Wansheng, was also killed. Yang was 63 years old, lived at Zhenghe Bridge, South Gate, Wuxi, studied in Japan, graduated from Tokyo High School, and was the manager of Guangqin Yarn Factory before the war. He took office as a puppet official on August 13 last year. Recently, Qianqiao Xin Sheng Silk Factory bribed to release the detained fresh cocoons with 40,000 yuan, which was found out by the puppet provincial government and given a major demerit. Before a few days had passed, he was shot and killed. No one knows who will succeed him. Since the 11th, the puppet government has temporarily stopped issuing county resident certificates, moving certificates, and passes. The Japanese army has also banned traffic inside and outside the city, and on Wuqiao, Xinglong Bridge, Yinglong Bridge, Qingming Bridge, Tingzi Bridge, Shiren Bridge, and Tangnan Bridge from 6 PM to 8 AM the next day (Japanese time) without the permission of the Japanese army. The Japanese Gendarmerie has offered a reward of 1,000 yuan to investigate and arrest the attackers. Water and land transportation is also very strict. The city gate has been closed for three days and has not yet been opened.

### Dinghai Puppet Officials Revolt

Dinghai correspondence, the Japanese army used the local gentry and scoundrels Ding Ziheng, Chen Jianan, He Chuicang, Qi Dejun, Wang Hongqing, Wang Kuichang, Xu Yangxi, Hong Qiliang, etc. to organize a puppet county government. However, there are quite a few upright gentry among them who were lured by the Japanese. County Chief Su sent spies to the city many times to persuade them to revolt or warn the criminals, hoping that they would repent. As a result, Shen Songnan, the puppet vice-chairman who was forced to be a traitor, Chen Songling, the chief of the finance section, and Hu Muxin, the chief of the transportation section, were all deeply moved, so they abandoned their official hats and fled to other places to hide. Yesterday, dozens of puppet soldiers revolted again and brought their guns and equipment to join the Chinese guerrillas. Therefore, the Japanese army has been extremely panicked recently.

### Fujian Province Promotes Wartime Higher Education, National Xiamen University Moves to Western Fujian, Three Private Schools Also Move to Northern Fujian, Fujian Provincial University Actively Prepares to Open in the Spring

(Fuzhou correspondence) There are four universities in Fujian Province: National Xiamen University and three private colleges: Union College, Fujian College, and Hwa Nan Women's College. Xiamen University was located in Xiamen before the war and has now moved to the interior of western Fujian. Union College, Fujian College, and Hwa Nan Women's College were all located in Fuzhou before the war and have now moved to the interior of northern Fujian. Among them, Xiamen University has the most complete equipment, followed by Union College. According to a recent inspection report by the Ministry of Education, after Xiamen University moved to a certain place in western Fujian, the school buildings were rented from private houses and ancestral halls, most of which were too small and insufficient for use. There are now three colleges and nine departments: the College of Liberal Arts has three departments: Chinese Literature, History, and Education; the College of Science has four departments: Mathematics and Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and Civil Engineering; and the College of Business has two departments: Commerce and Economics. There are a total of 319 male and female students in the entire school, including 74 in the College of Liberal Arts, 113 in the College of Science, and 114 in the College of Business. There are a total of 87 faculty and staff members. A tutor system is implemented, dividing the students into 23 groups, each group with 9 to 13 people, and a tutor is responsible for guiding them. The tutor group meets once a month to discuss moral education and practical issues. Starting this year, it is planned to establish a class in the Department of Education, the nature of which is similar to the second part of the normal college and the in-service training class for secondary school teachers, to train excellent teachers for secondary schools to meet the current needs of the province. However, since the beginning of the War of Resistance, universities and colleges in major cities in the southeast have completely moved to the southwest and northwest provinces. The universities and colleges in this province are also limited by economics and student places, and cannot accommodate high school graduates in this province as much as possible. At the same time, in order to actively carry out public health and various economic construction projects in the province, and train local administrative cadres, a large number of agricultural, medical, and law specialists are needed. Therefore, a medical college was established in the 26th year of the Republic and renamed the Provincial Medical College in July of this year. Now the provincial government has decided to run a large-scale Provincial Fujian University next year, with three colleges: Agriculture, Law, and Medicine, and an attached normal training course, specializing in training teachers for secondary schools in this province. At present, two groups of science and music are set up first, and then groups such as Chinese language, history, and geography will be added. The start-up fee is set at 400,000 yuan, and the regular annual fee is 360,000 yuan, which has been passed by the provincial government meeting and included in the next year's budget. Regarding all preparatory matters, the provincial government has appointed 12 preparatory committee members to prepare in groups. The drafting of university regulations, the compilation of college courses, the purchase of books and instruments, and the construction of school buildings have all begun and are expected to open in February next year. In addition, the Department of Education has ordered the organization of a graduate continuing research committee in various private colleges. It has been found that graduates of various private colleges in Fujian Province rarely have the opportunity to continue academic research after leaving school. Even if a few young people can work hard to study on their own, they also feel the pain of no guidance and lack of tools. In order to make up for the above shortcomings and promote the atmosphere of academic research, the Department of Education has specially formulated the guidelines for the organization of the graduate continuing research committee in various private colleges, and has detailed regulations on the methods of guiding graduates to continue research. The provincial government has ordered all colleges to comply with it. (November 20)

### Ministry of Education Investigates Educational Organizations in Shanghai

(Chongqing News) It is reported from Shanghai that there are so-called "Educational Association," "China Education Federation," "China School Federation," "Private School Association," "Private School Federation," and "Primary School Federation" and other "organizations" that issued notices to schools to increase tuition fees and improve treatment due to the soaring prices in Shanghai. The Ministry of Education has already stopped the activities of the Shanghai Secondary School Teachers' Union, the Secondary School Principals' Union, and the Secondary School Advancement Association. As for the so-called "Educational Association," "Private School Advancement Association," and "Primary School Federation," they have not applied to the Ministry for registration and will not be recognized according to law. The Ministry has also telegraphed Shanghai to investigate thoroughly, hoping that the Shanghai education community will pay attention to organizations that falsely borrow names. (Dahua News Agency)

### First Cycle Creates a Winning Streak: Lido Defeats St. Francis Xavier 4-2, With Lido Leading 3-1 in the First Half: Lido's Offense and Defense Were Excellent Yesterday

Lido has created a clean sweep of all victories in the first cycle of the Western Union Football First Division League. Yesterday, at the Yiyuan Stadium, they overcame the so-called dark horse, St. Francis Xavier, 4-2, with Lido leading 3-1 in the first half. With this, the entire first cycle is complete. St. Francis Xavier is made up of young and strong players. In the first ten minutes of the game, they played with vigor and momentum. Lido was almost in danger due to the intensity of their offensive. Fortunately, Lido's defense was strong, with Li Yichen guarding the three goals like an impregnable wall. St. Francis Xavier failed to break through, and their morale was weakened. Lido switched to offense, using the left wing, where Qiu Ting was very active, repeatedly penetrating. The St. Francis Xavier team's defense was weak and fell into chaos, losing three goals in a row. The outcome was thus determined. The rest of the game was just formality. The lineups of the two sides were as follows: Lido: Lu Zhongen, Li Yichen, Zhang Linggen, Yan Shixin, Meng Yiliang, Jiang Zhaoxiang, Cao Qiuheng, Sun Jinshun, Huang Kehou, Xu Wenkui, Wu Qixiang. St. Francis Xavier: Kai Botuo, Qie Hu Te, S. Xu Erz, Eduard, Greenbo, K. Kui Shitie, Kai Luolie, Qu Pantuosun, Xu Erz, Toutuo Meng, Fu En.

St. Francis Xavier Runs Rampant

St. Francis Xavier kicked off and attacked first. Huang Kehou intercepted and passed the ball, and Wu Qixiang rushed into the enemy's camp and shot, but it went wide. St. Francis Xavier came with all its strength, like a storm, unstoppable. This was St. Francis Xavier's initial momentum. It was a pity that it was only a flash in the pan, and the sharp edge gradually faded. Lido's army retreated, defending tightly. A Kui knocked down an enemy general and was penalized with a free kick. Greenbo aimed and shot fiercely, with great momentum. Chang Lu received and fumbled, but luckily kicked it out, averting danger. Unexpectedly, in a moment, Fu En, who had been trapped by Li Yichen for a long time, broke free from Li's shackles and drove straight in. Fortunately, Zhang Linggen saved it, which was a great contribution. Fu En came again, shooting from afar. Toutuo Meng gritted his teeth and shot dangerously. Both shots were saved by Li Yichen's divine block. Fu En caught the ball and lobbed it from afar, but there was no response, and Chang Lu finally caught it safely.

Three Goals in a Row

Within ten minutes, St. Francis Xavier was so fierce and invincible. Lido fought hard, and the situation was dull and undeveloped. But finally, the tide turned. Qiu Ting cut in and fell into the enemy's arms. A Kui crossed three levels and passed it to the center. Unexpectedly, Kehou headed it, missing by an inch. Qiu Ting cut across the center, dribbling and shooting. Sun Jinshun arrived in time, but just as he was about to shoot, Greenbo cleared it from the danger zone. Qiu Ting Kehou then made two consecutive fierce shots, but still failed to score. In a blink of an eye, more than half an hour had passed. Two minutes later, A Kui made a long pass from the center, and Qixiang intercepted and rushed forward, lobbing it to the center. Jinshun Kehou rushed together, and Kai Botuo was knocked to the ground, unable to get up quickly. Sun Jinshun headed the ball outside the goal line, then pushed it into the net, scoring the first goal. The audience cheered. Four minutes later, Lido's golden gun was fired, and the momentum was like a broken bamboo. A Sun and Qiu Ting passed the ball to each other. A Sun seized the opportunity and passed it. Qiu Ting shot, and the St. Francis Xavier goal was broken again. Five minutes later, Qiu Ting cleverly tricked Da Xu Erz, passing it to A Kui from afar. A Kui headed it backward, and the iron leg volleyed, kicking it into the lower right corner from afar. Lido scored three goals in seven minutes, and the audience cheered. Fusi was entangled by Yichen, and urgently switched positions with Toutuo Meng, but still could not escape A Li's control. So he changed to center forward, which was indeed effective. In the forty-second minute, Fusi passed from the center, and Eduard took advantage of the momentum to lob it. Zhang Linggen missed it, and Kai Luolie strode in and shot from five yards away. Chang Lu had no choice but to let the ball in. St. Francis Xavier broke the duck egg, and the first half ended 3-1.

One Gain and One Loss

After the two teams regrouped, Fu En still played center forward, but was strictly guarded by Meng Yiliang and still did nothing. Both sides built high walls, and the situation became dull again. At the fourteenth minute, A Li made a long pass outside the field, and Xiao Xu penetrated to twelve yards, and it seemed certain that it would hit, but unexpectedly it was blocked by Da Xu Erz and went out. In a blink of an eye, Xiao Xu shot from thirty yards away, and Chang Lu blocked it with his arm and kicked it out of the danger zone. In the sixteenth minute, A Kui and Qie Hu Te competed for the ball. The ball touched Qie Hu Te's hand, and A Kui took the penalty kick at twelve yards, hitting the lower left corner with his right foot, making it 4-1. The victory was thus established. After that, Lido's offensive was repeated, but none of them were successful. A Kui's shot flew high into the sky, and Lao Sun's close header went wide. Qixiang again hit the goalkeeper's arms. After that, the situation calmed down, and Lido did not do too much, relaxing the offensive, thinking of celebrating the victory, but unexpectedly in the last two minutes, Pantuo Tianbian shot from twenty yards away, and flew straight into the upper right corner of the net. Soon after, the whistle blew, and Lido won 4-2.

### Reserve Cup Replay: Lido Eliminated, Lax Gets Finals Ticket in 1-3 Overtime Victory

The reserve cup replay between Lido and Lax took place yesterday at Jiaozhou Park. It attracted a large audience. Unexpectedly, Lido suffered a heavy loss due to the fierce battle with Fangji in the morning, Li Yichen bore the brunt of the damage, Sun Jinshun's fat body could no longer climb, and Meng Wu also struggled to support. With the main players discouraged, Lax was waiting leisurely, and was thus able to succeed. In the first half, Lido was in a favorable position, but failed to complete the task. Repeated good opportunities were lost due to A Li's inability to move. In the replay, Meng Yiliang accidentally fouled after only five minutes, and was penalized with a free kick. Peige scored from twenty yards away, which was unexpected. Lido launched a desperate counterattack, and finally Wu Qixiang scored one goal each in the last three minutes. In the extended replay, Yinggelun scored another goal in the first half, making it 2-1. In the second half, Wu Ermu also scored in the crowd, and Lido suffered an unprecedented defeat of 1-3, and unexpectedly lost the Reserve Cup, which was deeply regrettable. After Lax won the finals ticket, they will compete with Xifusi for the championship. In yesterday's game, Lido's Zheng Tongyu and Jiang Chao were very hard-working. Meng Yiliang still had stamina, but Wu lost more than just that. The front line was full of injured players, and only Xiao Wu was able to score a goal. The lineup is as follows: Lido Club: Zheng Tongyu, Jiang Chao, Meng Yiliang, Yun Feng, Zhang Xianlun, Wu Qixiang, Le Xiuhua, Zeng Rongzhong, Li Yichen, Shen Zuliang, Zhang Mingsheng. Lax: Greenbo, Musaidike, Kofu Lie, Kofu Siji, Aqigu Fu, Xu Lun Siji, Ke Xunaite, Ke Tiebo Tuo, Bo Blot, Yinggelun Pei Ge Wu Ermu.

Yesterday's Football Results

Lido Club defeated St. Francis Xavier (Group A) 4-1. Lax defeated Lido Reserve (Reserve Replay) 3-1. Italian Navy defeated French Army (Character Cup) 4-2. Italian Navy defeated French Army (Replay) 4-2. French Chamber of Commerce drew with St. Francis Xavier (Reserve Group) 1-1. Park Union defeated Song Union (Group B) 5-2.

### Tonight's Xiqing Basketball: Shanghai Qing vs. Mai Bai

Since Shanghai Qing joined the Xiqing Basketball Tournament, it has only missed three appearances so far, making it one of the teams with the fewest opportunities to play among the eleven troops. It has accumulated two wins and one loss. However, because it has the most opportunities, even though it unfortunately lost to the Little Bears 37-29 in the first game, it is still a team with bright hopes for the future. Tonight's battle against Mai Bai is a crucial test of their ability to strive for the top. Tonight's Group B game is Yun team vs. Giant, starting at 7:15. The schedule is as follows: Yun Team vs. Giant (Group B) 7:15 Shanghai Qing vs. Mai Bai (Group A) 8:00 Zhong Yi vs. Mai Hong (Group A) 9:00

### The Dynamics of Shanghai Finance in the 28th Year

— Zhu Boquan

I. Introduction

Since the war spread in the winter of the 26th year, the ports along the Yangtze River and the coast have fallen one after another, and Shanghai has a sense of being an isolated island. This is true in terms of the political environment and transportation, and it is also true in terms of the economic situation.

Shanghai has always been the trade center of the Southeast. Now, the agricultural and native products of various places, such as cotton, rice, silk cocoons, jute, and livestock, are either prohibited by the government or obstructed by transportation in the inland areas, and most of them cannot be transported to Shanghai. In the occupied areas, most of them are controlled or bought out. There are very few who can freely transport to Shanghai for marketing or distribution, and regardless of whether the industry and other industries in the occupied areas still exist or not, there is no way to intervene. Therefore, the original normal economic relationship between Shanghai and various places is like a broken lotus root with lingering threads, which is very different from the past. Even though there has been a good harvest in various places this year, the benefits of trade migration are mostly not owned by the Chinese people.

Before describing the main text, we must first examine the general economic situation within the isolated island, and then we can have a more intimate understanding of the financial market in the past year.

The economy within the isolated island has many morbidities after the war, which has been very obvious in the past year. The main points are divided and described as follows:

Because (1) the order and safety of the Shanghai Concession has been maintained to a considerable extent, the people who fled from various places during the war all regarded Shanghai as a paradise, and they have gathered more and more in the past two years. Where people gather, funds follow. In addition, (2) the economic facilities in the North have been renovated this year, and (3) the war has broken out in Europe, and the British Eastern territories have implemented financial controls. For these two reasons, the funds that have been fleeing have also regarded Shanghai as a den. Therefore, the funds accumulated in Shanghai in the 26th year have become more and more rampant in recent years. Although the discussion about the transfer of funds to the Southwest has been very popular in recent years, the large-scale transfer may not be achieved overnight. How to coordinate and consider both aspects and disperse the funds in Shanghai so that they can be used in the right way still needs further efforts. This influx of hot money is one of the morbidities.

The influx of hot money is so great, and the normal investment channels are even more lacking due to the aforementioned interruption of trade relations with various places. Therefore, the buying and selling of foreign exchange, foreign currencies, gold, and various goods has reached its peak this year. Speculators regard it as a shortcut to get rich quickly, and those who are worried regard it as a guarantee of private property. If they don't go this way, they will go that way. This prosperity of speculation is the second morbidity.

Prices have soared this year. According to the figures released by the China Statistical Society, taking the 25th year as the benchmark, the 26th year was 118 strong, the 27th year was 153 weak, June of this year was 164, and it rose step by step to 283 strong in September. The reasons are (A) the crazy shrinkage of the foreign exchange black market, (B) the continuation of the European war, plus (C) all kinds of commodity speculation within the concession, and (D) all kinds of controls outside the concession. The prices within the isolated island are no longer limited to economic factors. Therefore, the rice is as precious as pearls and the firewood is as expensive as cassia, which is not only a description in words. The public within the isolated island has actually shouldered the same burden as the people in the war zone. This is a very serious problem that cannot be ignored. This is the third morbidity.

Due to the large local consumption, the sharp increase in prices, the stimulation of the European war, the small industries, importers, and retailers within the concession have all achieved a well-off life in recent years. The real estate and construction industries have also become more active than the previous year due to the continued increase in population. This prosperous image of industry and commerce within the concession is a morbidity that cannot be denied. This is the fourth morbidity.

The financial market situation in the past year is divided into sections and described below.

II. Issuance of Legal Tender

The total amount of legal tender issued at the end of June in the 26th year before the war was 140,000 yuan (approximately, the same below). At the end of the same year after the war, it was 160,000 yuan. At the end of June of the 27th year, it was 170,000 yuan. In July of this year, the government announced that the total amount of legal tender issued at the end of June of the 28th year was 260,000 yuan. The ratio of cash reserves to guarantee reserves, which was originally 60 to 40, is now 44 to 56. Comparing the above figures, the increase in issuance in the first year after the war was only 30,000 yuan, the increase in the second year was 90,000 yuan, and the amount issued at the end of June of this year increased by one time compared to before the war.

Regarding the increase of about one time in the issuance of legal tender after the war, there were quite a few malicious comments at the time. But: (1) Since the currency system reform in the 24th year of our country, the amount issued increased by about 60,000 yuan in the 25th year. After the war broke out, the increase in the first year of the war was reduced. In fact, at this time, the issuance of legal tender continued in the process of development, and the reason why the increase was reduced was mostly due to the government's consistent adoption of a sound and conservative policy on the issuance of legal tender. In the early stage of the war, there was even a trend of contraction. (2) Although legal tender in the war zone has been destroyed and used in many ways, the need for it in the southwestern provinces is still great. It cannot be compared with the use of banknotes in other countries, which has already reached a considerable level, or even an extreme level. In the past year, the government has repeatedly stated that the policy of maintaining legal tender has not changed. It has tried its best to tighten legal tender in the war zone, and it has also been extremely cautious about the supply of legal tender in Shanghai. All of these are facts that are better than eloquence. It can be said that there is no sign of malignant inflation so far. As for the reduction of cash reserves, it is true that the government said that it is still higher than most countries.

Since the foreign exchange black market has been shrinking frequently, and in August there were rumors that the government had ordered a large amount of legal tender abroad, in the isolated island where rumors are as many as waves, "Will legal tender become the mark?" We often hear this question. Those who are slightly knowledgeable, have common sense, know the history of the mark, and know the status of the issuance of legal tender can immediately deny it. However, the fanaticism of the foreign exchange market has suddenly increased. We have no way to estimate how much legal tender is circulating in Shanghai, but because the status of legal tender is of great concern to the general public, we will briefly describe one or two in this section.

The soaring prices this year have greatly reduced the purchasing power of legal tender in Shanghai. However, the purchasing power of the same legal tender is very different in Shanghai and other places, and there are also differences in other places. Taking rice as an example, the market price in eastern Zhejiang is only half of that in Shanghai. The high price of goods in Shanghai is no longer dominated by various economic factors. As mentioned earlier, the low exchange rate of the legal tender black market is one of the above-mentioned economic factors, but the increase in the amount of legal tender issued is not enough to constitute a factor. As for the prices in the inland areas, although they are all higher than before the war, each has its own reasons in terms of production and transportation.

As countries intensify their military buildup, the prices of metals have soared. Between summer and autumn, the copper coins, copper subsidiary coins, and copper-nickel subsidiary coins circulating in the market were all bought up, melted down, and smuggled. In addition to the angular subsidiary coin tickets, subsidiary coins are almost extinct in the market. Therefore, stamps were used as substitutes, and then train tickets, bus tickets, stamps, etc. all became temporary subsidiary coins. General stores printed value vouchers for change. The variety was dazzling, which was extremely inconvenient for the public. The price increase was probably also assisted by this invisibly. After September, the Central Bank issued five-cent and one-cent subsidiary coin tickets, and increased the issuance of angular subsidiary coin tickets to meet the needs. The number seems to be still insufficient.

III. Foreign Exchange Black Market

The most changeable and influential aspect of finance this year is the foreign exchange black market. Since the government implemented foreign exchange control last year, the Central Bank has supplied foreign exchange at the statutory price. Because its supply is extremely strict, the general demand for foreign exchange is still obtained from the black market. The transaction is quite prosperous, and the market price is also quite stable due to the government's regulation. The situation this year can be divided into three periods:

The first period is from January to May. At the beginning of the year, the foreign exchange black market still hovered around 8 pence to 8 and a half pence. In March, the Exchange Equalization Fund was established with a fund of 10 million pounds, and the British borrowed half of the fund. Therefore, the rise and fall of the foreign exchange black market was less significant. However, the demand for foreign exchange was still huge. Generally speaking, there were four reasons:

(1) The huge amount of imports exceeding exports. Although Shanghai has always been an import-export port, the amount of imports exceeding exports has never been greater than at this time. According to Finance & Commerce statistics, from January to June of this year, Shanghai's foreign trade converted imports at the statutory price first, and then converted to national currency at the black market price. The total imports were 600 million yuan, and the exports were 170 million yuan. The imports exceeding exports in half a year reached 430 million yuan, which is about 13 times the imports exceeding exports in the same period of the 27th year. (2) The escape of funds from the north. In North China, the so-called joint bank notes were forcibly used this spring, and the price of legal tender was reduced in stages. Even the circulation and use of legal tender in the Tianjin Concession was threatened in many ways. Therefore, the funds from the Northeast came to Shanghai in a steady stream, and one part of them was used for foreign exchange. (3) The Japanese used various tricks to arbitrage the legal tender that was looted in the north and other war zones. After this legal tender came to Shanghai, it was exchanged for foreign exchange at any time. (4) Although the general public in Shanghai has a long-standing belief in legal tender, the psychology of the masses during wartime is very different from peacetime. They follow the crowd and are unavoidable. Most of them are overly worried, but the trend of hoarding legal tender, when applied to foreign exchange, adds another burden to the foreign exchange market. At the same time, the export bills on the market are as rare as phoenix feathers. Under this state of oversupply, the continued stability of the black market exchange rate for more than five months is almost entirely due to the support of the government and the Equalization Fund.

The second period is from June to August. On June 7th, the Exchange Equalization Fund temporarily stopped maintaining the black market exchange rate. The announcement was like a bolt from the blue, and the city was shocked. Rumors spread, and speculative and blind buying came one after another. HSBC Bank changed its listing three times in one day. The 8 pence black market exchange rate, which had been stable for 18 months, fell to about 6 and a half pence.

There were many different speculations about the Equalization Fund's cessation of foreign exchange supply to the black market at that time, except for meaningless and malicious rumors. The most common one was that the fund had been used up in the past three months and could no longer be maintained. In fact, as mentioned above, the purchase of foreign exchange in the first half of the year was as described above. In the continuation of this situation, whether it is a wise move to continue to maintain the 8 pence exchange rate is self-evident. The abundance of the fund balance is a secondary issue. Therefore, the financial authorities issued a statement on July 10th, saying that the matter was approved by the government, and its purpose was to make the black market exchange rate "suitable for the standards that are beneficial to China's economy." The market's hearing was corrected. At the same time, at the new level of about 6 and a half pence, there was a considerable supply in the market, and the respite was slightly relieved.

### Japan's Economy is Collapsing

— Zhao Jianzi

Blatant Signs of Collapse

There are many reasons why Japanese Prime Minister Abe's position is unstable; however, the lower house members only single out the economy, which is beyond remedy, as a target of attack. The military also uses the "insufficient resolution of the China Incident as a pretext for clinging to power" to pressure Abe to step down. Revealing the hardships of the people, whether as a facade or not, is always the most powerful means in political struggle. From this, one can imagine the anxiety in the lives of his people! (Editor: The Abe cabinet has already fallen.)

This is the fourth reorganization of Japan's wartime cabinet, and it is the first time that economic problems have been used as a reason for the cabinet's downfall. The Japanese economy has always suffered from congenital deficiencies, and the war has exacerbated this condition. In the past, the hardships of the Japanese people had long been unbearable, but their ruling class still avoided mentioning them, maintaining a calm demeanor. Now, they have suddenly become flustered and, with the joint signature of more than half of the members of the Diet, are publicly declaring the reasons for the cabinet's downfall, shouting loudly. Of course, it is already in imminent danger; I am sure they will still avoid seeking medical attention for their condition!

The Disintegration of the Ruling Class

Japan's ruling class is a combination of warlords, bureaucrats, and financial cliques. The first threat to them when the national economy collapses is "financial helplessness."

"Financial helplessness": The warlords will have no power to wield because their power relies solely on modern weapons, which can only be obtained by extracting the fat from the people. The ability and purpose of bureaucrats to be active is nothing more than money. Without money, they are also at a loss. The financial cliques are uniquely afraid of the financial burden being too great, unable to be passed on to the people; profits will be drastically reduced, and there is even the danger of having to empty their own pockets. Therefore, whenever the issue of finance is raised, Japan's ruling class will start to clash with each other. Although the targets of attack by the lower house members are food and prices, seemingly speaking for the people; in essence, they are planning for themselves. However, this calculation must be based on stabilizing the livelihoods of the people. Thus, they have chosen the two points of food and prices, which are of serious concern to the people's livelihood.

Financial Helplessness

In the past two and a half years: total expenditures have exceeded 21 billion; of which 12.7 billion have been thrown into the Chinese battlefield and have vanished into thin air. In order to raise this uncompensated expenditure, 10.7 billion in public bonds and more than 1.1 billion in banknotes (excluding those issued in Korea and Taiwan, and military currency in China) have been issued; and general taxes have been increased by 50% to 3-4 times. For example, ordinary income tax, which used to be 50 yuan, now requires 211 yuan; like the temporary profits tax, which used to be 30 yuan, now one must pay 140 yuan or face imprisonment. Moreover, in addition to this desperate expenditure, there is also the loss of millions of lives and countless indirect losses of various material and spiritual kinds!

The total amount of expenditures for the next fiscal year has increased by more than 1 billion yuan compared to the current year, reaching 10.4 billion yuan. Although temporary military expenses are listed as 4.5 billion, general accounting has increased by nearly 700 million, reaching 4.95 billion yuan. Among them, the combined increase for the army and navy is nearly 500 million, accounting for more than 2.3 billion; debt servicing has increased by 200 million, reaching 1.4 billion. In order to supply such huge funds, taxes are ruthlessly increased again, but the estimated increase is less than 1 billion; therefore, they have no choice but to plan to issue another 5.5 billion yuan in new public bonds.

Of the 10.7 billion new public bonds issued in the past two and a half years, 2.1 billion were handed over to the deposit department, and 7.6 billion were handed over to the Bank of Japan. This is what they call "digestion of public bonds." At the end of Showa 11 (i.e., the end of 1936 before the war), the current amount of Japan's national debt was 10.4 billion; the following year (i.e., the end of the first half-year of the war) it increased to 11.9 billion; at the end of the 13th year, it increased to 16.2 billion; at the end of November last year, it had already increased to nearly 20.9 billion, and by the end of the next fiscal year, it is feared that it will break through the 30 billion mark.

Leaving aside how long this can last? Looking at the present, both the Japanese government and the people have reached the end of their rope.

The Disintegration of the National Economy

Looking at the two points of commodity prices and food that the lower house members are attacking, they include all the symptoms of the disintegration of Japan's wartime economic system. The material needs of the war have exhausted foreign exchange resources and the people's living resources; therefore, commodity prices have soared, and there is no way to remedy it. In November last year, the wholesale price index increased to 242%, the retail price index increased to 235.7%, and the cost of living index increased to 226%. No matter how high-pressure the government implements control, the upward trend is still increasing day by day.

The manpower needs of the war have emptied the labor force in rural and urban areas. According to the Diamond Company's survey, the proportion of female and child labor in the total number of factory workers has increased by an average of more than double compared to before the war, reaching 48.1%; the situation in rural areas is even worse. Therefore, agricultural production has sharply decreased, and famine is becoming more serious. The lack of manpower makes it impossible to replenish the army and increase production is in a desperate situation; foreign trade is becoming increasingly worse. In the past two years and eleven months, exports to third countries were only 5.87 billion yuan, while imports reached 7.62 billion, with a trade deficit of 1.8 billion yuan. Considering the situation of trade and other receipts in his pre-war international balance of payments, most of them were overpayments exceeding income: like Showa 10, the overpayment was 194 million yuan, and in Showa 11, the overpayment was 36 million yuan. Under these circumstances, who can believe the reports he published on gold reserve preparations?

According to his own account, Japan's domestic gold production is only a little over 100 million yuan per year, and it can never offset the reverse surplus in the international balance of payments. Therefore, the only way to procure overseas materials, apart from seizing the foreign exchange resources in the occupied areas of China, is to seize the living needs of the people of other countries to supplement them. Seizing people's needs to meet military needs is already a last resort; moreover, the other side of suppressing people's needs is the complete exhaustion of financial tax sources. Therefore, financially, they have no choice but to rely on borrowing and issuing more banknotes. The more the banknotes inflate, the more commodity prices rise, the more purchasing power decreases, the more the volume of commodity transactions among the people declines, and the contraction rate of banknote issuance is equal to zero. For example, the contraction rate of banknote issuance in January of this year was only 26.4%, which had decreased to 10.4% by November; in October, it even shrunk to 6.9%. Pure inflation is the main phenomenon in malignant inflation. Japan's wartime economy is moving towards this malignant end of pure inflation. No matter what, they do not hesitate to prohibit banknotes flowing out of the country from returning to the country. This last resort of "foreign goods when leaving home" not only completely loses the credit of the Japanese yen but also cuts off the foreign exchange resources of overseas remittances from overseas Chinese, which is the main item in its trade and other income. Therefore, the result is that the difficulty in procuring materials is increasingly increased; thus, the vicious cycle of borrowing, increasing taxes, issuing more banknotes, seizing people's needs, promoting high commodity prices, sharply reducing purchasing power, declining people's transactions, and exhausting tax sources, finally stepping into today's desperate situation.

Conclusion

Japan's ruling class has seen that as the war drags on, China's economic foundation for resistance and reconstruction becomes stronger day by day, while its own war economic foundation is closer to complete bankruptcy. Therefore, they are eager to make peace. But unconditional peace would mean that the Japanese warlords would not be able to account for their actions back home; conditional peace is definitely not what China wants to hear. Because of this stalemate, in China, it is precisely where the long-term war of resistance has a chance of winning; in Japan, however, it is difficult to escape the dangerous fate of a complete collapse; and this dangerous fate is now rapidly sweeping in. Therefore, when looking forward to the future of the Sino-Japanese War, apart from the Japanese, there is absolutely no need to consider the issue of war and peace; there are only the goals of victory and defeat; and victory will definitely belong to China, and defeat will definitely belong to Japan. The Japanese members of the Diet unprecedentedly used economic problems as the reason for the cabinet's downfall, which reflects the micro-signs that the Japanese economy has begun to collapse rapidly; it also sets forth that China's war of resistance has grasped the assurance of final victory. In order to welcome the speed of the final victory, in addition to military efforts, economic resistance should be strengthened. The people in the occupied areas should especially resolutely oppose the economic blockade in terms of materials, so as to shatter his dream of borrowing the body to revive the soul! They should not use the excuse of a special environment, sticking their necks out and letting him carry out blood-letting work!

### Grain: Japonica Rice Stabilizes, Inland Merchants Actively Purchase Imported Rice, Which Initially Soars but Then Recedes

Because bank warehouses are all closed on Sundays, goods in each warehouse are not available for inspection; only goods in our own warehouse are traded among themselves in the market; therefore, retail and wholesale transactions are scarce. Only local stores purchase small amounts of early japonica and early and late glutinous rice, so from morning to noon, there is little change in the prices of various goods. Although rice stores have slow sales, merchants from the interior suddenly actively purchase, all in wholesale transactions. The opening market is tight, and merchants shout out high prices. No. 1 Saigon rises from 37.3 yuan to 38 yuan, No. 2 Saigon also rises from 36.3 yuan to 37 yuan, rising all the way, seemingly about to soar into the clouds. However, general sellers also change their initial intentions and instead sell, making the market even tighter. Suddenly, some sell at high prices, and the market supply increases, so merchants from the interior are discouraged and unwilling to buy more. The market is then seen to hesitate and gradually soften. At the closing market, the price is only slightly higher than the opening market by two or three jiao.

Knowledge of Sexuality

### Discussion on External Stimuli of Sexuality

— Dr. Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Medical Department of the Russian Labor University

…Internal stimuli are caused by the vigor of hormones in the puberty glands…External stimuli are caused by the temptation of pornographic books and beauty

Although sexual desire is an instinct of human life, known without learning and capable without telling, there must be a reason for it to cause sexual arousal. What is the reason? That is, the relationship between internal and external stimuli. The so-called internal stimuli are when sexual desire naturally springs up and impulses without external temptation, and there are two reasons for this! One is the vigor of the puberty glands, and the other is the vigor of endocrine stimuli such as the thyroid gland and pituitary gland. This kind of puberty gland or thyroid gland endocrine has a certain amount, but if it is vigorous, this kind of secretion is enough to stimulate the sexual nerves and make them start. If there is too much secretion, the more the sexual nerves are stimulated, the more intense their start. Therefore, even without external temptation, sexual desire can also naturally impulse.

As for external stimuli, there are many kinds, some belonging to the mental and some belonging to the physiological. The former is caused by mental function, such as reading pornographic books, pornographic plays, pornographic paintings, and having beauty in front of you, all belonging to this. No matter how honest and reliable one is, when encountering external temptation, the nerves will inevitably be stimulated. Once stimulated, the sexual nerves will be affected, and sexual desire will inevitably impulse. Therefore, researchers of sexuality must not be ignorant of the two major causes of internal and external stimuli.

If the puberty glands of internal stimuli lose their prosperity, their sexual desire will show a morbid state. Even if there is external temptation, even if beauty is in front of you, it will be of no avail. Therefore, those who are good at hygiene must not allow the hormones of the puberty glands that dominate sexual desire to be wounded by荒淫, because apart from the decline of age, it is caused by excessive masturbation or纵慾荒淫. After the puberty glands are weak, nocturnal emission, spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, and neurasthenia cannot be avoided. How can one get pleasure during intercourse? This is not only a sign of one's own physical weakness, but also affects the love between husband and wife.

Now that it is clear that sexual desire stimulation lies in the prosperity of the puberty glands, therefore impotence, premature ejaculation, and other symptoms are also caused by the loss of health of the puberty glands. Therefore, the only way to treat the symptoms is to actively take the male "Butikon" containing hormones of male壮动物 puberty glands, which is most suitable for the symptoms, because "Butikon" contains pure testicular essence, all collected from orangutans and monkeys, because the nature of orangutans and monkeys is most suitable for the human body, and it contains brain-nourishing phosphorus, blood-nourishing iron, and bone-nourishing calcium. It produces sperm and nourishes the kidneys within 24 hours after taking it. The female "Butikon" can regulate menstruation and seeds, and has long been praised by doctors.

Spring and Autumn of Gonorrhea

### Groundbreaking Anti-Gonorrhea Drug

— American Medical Doctor Huang Zhongchang

In recent years, my treatment of gonorrhea has become smoother than before; because my pathological anatomy of gonorrhea has been identified by science and experience, and in terms of medication, there is also a special drug available. Giving us a strong help.

Speaking of the invention of the special drug for gonorrhea, it was not accidental. Originally, the contagiousness of gonorrhea was extremely strong, and once infected, before "Kerinon" was invented, it simply made it impossible for doctors and patients to get rid of it. Therefore, every time gonorrhea is infected, it inevitably changes from acute to chronic, and from chronic to malignant. Once gonorrhea becomes malignant, the patient not only has the danger of making the disease infertile, but also has his life sacrificed by it, which is very regrettable. Therefore, all countries are actively working to prevent gonorrhea, and are rewarding scientists with honor and money. Of course, there must be brave men under heavy rewards, and Dr. Peter, a German gonorrhea master, took the lead in inventing the special drug for gonorrhea "Kerinon," which achieved unprecedented amazing results, and is worthy of being a groundbreaking achievement in gonorrhea treatment. Therefore, the world's most honorable and bonus was obtained by Dr. Peter and recognized as a special drug for gonorrhea. I have a good and pleasant impression of this drug.

Whether it is just beginning or has become chronic leukorrhea, taking "Kerinon" can produce anti-gonorrhea phagocytic effect in the shortest time. This effect occurs in every cell in the body, so its bactericidal power is abundant throughout the body, reaching everywhere and every detail; therefore, both acute and chronic gonorrhea can be taken. As for external medicine, men can use "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" externally according to the diagram and instructions to wash the urethra. Women with gonorrhea leucorrhea, in addition to taking "Kerinon" internally, can also use "Car Er Xue Di Vaginal Tablets" externally as a suppository, which will be effective. Strong physician

### Cured Example of Cold Limbs

— German Medical Doctor Zheng Ting

Patient Yu Chengda, 37 years old, Ningbo, Zhejiang, lives at No. 2, Xin Qiao Yong An Lane, Sampan Factory, Mupu, (self-report) - I was born with congenital insufficiency, and also had nocturnal emission before marriage. After marriage, I felt kidney deficiency. After I was 30 years old, I became more and more depressed. I felt back pain when I sat down a little.

Gonorrhea Lecture

### Gonorrhea Damages Marital Happiness

— Yao Juyan Physician Consultation time: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM

"No disease is a god, having a wife is enough for everything", the first sentence is an idiom, and the second sentence is derived from "having a son is enough for everything". In fact, based on my experience of more than 20 years, the love between couples in the world was originally very strong, but there are many who destroy their love due to venereal diseases, so those who suffer from venereal diseases often cause nameless resentment in their wives due to the transmission of the virus. In this way, how much fun is there in life? Therefore, once there is a venereal disease, especially gonorrhea, it should be treated immediately. Having gonorrhea is equivalent to the wife asking for a divorce. Even if there is a wise wife who reluctantly stays and leads a miserable life together, it is definitely not the happiness of a couple. Due to the above reasons, those who are infected with gonorrhea should be treated as soon as possible before entering the chronic gonorrhea period. It can be cured quickly and can avoid infecting the wife, which is a win-win situation. In case you have been misled by quack doctors and inferior medicines and turned to chronic gonorrhea, you must not fail to treat it early.

As for the treatment method, according to my many years of experience, only the special drug for gonorrhea "Kerinon" has the most excellent effect, because this drug uses non-specific therapy, and is made of a mixture of protein and pigments. After taking it, it can produce an anti-gonorrhea phagocytic effect within a few hours, and can have a direct bactericidal effect on the lesion without hindering other healthy parts. I also use German sensory static electricity therapy and German anti-gonorrhea blood serum, and the results are all expected. If the wife is also infected and has gonorrheal leucorrhea, in addition to taking "Kerinon" internally, you can also use "Car Er Xue Di Vaginal Tablets" externally as a suppository, which can also achieve the same effect and restore the happiness between husband and wife. Consultation time: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM Every day, 20 numbers are sent for consultation, and each number only costs 5 jiao and a full book on sexually transmitted diseases is given as a gift.

### Foreign Commentators Briefly Describe: China's Finances are Solid, National Banks Fulfill Wartime Tasks, and the People Support National Policies and Donate Generously

China's wartime finance has a solid foundation. For two years of the War of Resistance, it has been able to cope with it comfortably. According to foreign commentators, the reasons for the stability of China's wartime finance are: (1) China is still largely an agricultural society. The economic foundation lies in the broad countryside. A self-sufficient economic life exists everywhere in mainland China, so it is not as deeply affected by the war as industrialized countries. (2) The Chinese people are industrious and hardworking, and their living standards are very low, so they can all endure temporary pain. (3) Financial policies are appropriate, and financial institutions are becoming more and more comprehensive. For example, controlling foreign exchange, stabilizing the currency system, and achieving macro-effects. National banks can also fulfill wartime tasks under the overall national policy. (4) The promotion of foreign trade has increased exports of important Chinese products such as tung oil, tea, bristles, and medicinal materials compared to before the war. The European War still does not affect exports, which is of great benefit to the war economy. (5) Although China is at war, the people are motivated by patriotism and can still pay various donations and taxes as usual, even in areas adjacent to the war zone. The government has also not created new taxes under the pretext of wartime. Although there are excessive profits tax and inheritance tax after the war, they are taken from those who have the resources and are fair good taxes. In addition, the Chinese government has issued a number of value bonds, which have been deeply recognized and purchased by domestic and overseas Chinese, and automatic donations are also very enthusiastic.

According to the number of steamed buns distributed, a total of 1,680 were distributed on the 9th, 4,800 on the 10th, 7,488 on the 11th, 8,800 on the 12th, and 10,000 on the 13th.

### Children's Home Distributes Winter Clothes to Refugee Children on a Regular Basis, 6,000 Sets for Girls have been Made, Scheduled Distribution Dates

The Shanghai Office of the China Children's Welfare Association previously held a campaign to solicit winter clothes for refugee children last year, which was enthusiastically supported by all sectors of society, and the results were quite satisfactory. After the fundraising campaign was completed, the association immediately started the procedures for bidding and ordering.

### Japanese Currency Allowed for Purchasing Stamps; Shanghai Post Office Implements It; No Prior Report to the General Administration; Poorly Considered Measures Difficult to Implement; It is Said That the Occupied Areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Chongqing Are Also Collecting and Using It Simultaneously

The Shanghai Postal Administration issued Notice No. 1598 on the 9th of this month, allowing the purchase of stamps with Japanese currency or Japanese military scrip. The bureau may accept it at an exchange rate of one Japanese yen (i.e., one hundred sen) equaling 1.25 yuan in legal tender, effective today. However, all sectors are paying close attention. It is understood that this matter was unilaterally decided by the French Postal Director of the Bureau, Chapeleau, and the Japanese Deputy Postal Director, Kaneji Kin'ichiro, without the approval of Guo Xinshong, Director of the Kunming Postal General Administration of the Ministry of Communications. Therefore, the General Administration has not yet been informed of this matter. However, it is generally believed that this measure by the post office has the suspicion of promoting the power of the Japanese yen, so all sectors are determined not to accept Japanese currency or Japanese military scrip when purchasing stamps.

(Airmail Rates Also Changed)

Regarding the airmail rates required for airmail to Japan and North and Central China, new regulations have been set and will also be implemented today. (A) Airmail rates for air routes from Shanghai and Nanjing to Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and other Japanese territories: (1) Letters: 44 fen in national currency or 35 sen in Japanese currency per 20 grams or fraction thereof; (2) Postcards: 22.5 fen in national currency or 18 sen in Japanese currency per card; (3) Other mail: 94 fen in national currency or 75 sen in Japanese currency per 60 grams or fraction thereof; (B) Airmail rates for air routes from Shanghai, Nanjing, and Beiping to North China and from Shanghai, Nanjing, and Hankou to Central China (up to Hankou): (1) Letters: 25 fen in national currency or 20 sen in Japanese currency per 20 grams or fraction thereof; (2) Postcards: 12.5 fen in national currency or 10 sen in Japanese currency per card.

(Exchange Rate Set According to Market Regulations)

The bureau stated that the above method of converting national currency to Japanese currency is not fixed and will be determined at any time according to market value fluctuations. However, according to the opinions of the general postal community, the post office's sudden permission to purchase stamps with Japanese currency is tantamount to indirectly promoting the Japanese yen. Therefore, the above measures of the Shanghai Post Office are considered to be lacking in consideration. Furthermore, according to a Datong News Agency reporter's investigation, the post offices in the occupied areas of Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces have all decided to start collecting and using Japanese currency and Japanese military scrip today. The Shanghai Postal Authority has dispatched Japanese low-ranking inspectors to inspect the implementation of the purchase of stamps with Japanese currency and its exchange rate in the post offices in the occupied areas, and whether there are any difficulties.

Muslim Youth Celebrate Festival

The 20th of this month is the Muslim Eid al-Adha (Sacrifice Festival). Wealthy Muslims from all over the world gather in Mecca to worship the Kaaba. After completing the pilgrimage, they slaughter livestock and distribute it to relatives, friends, and poor believers. Those who cannot go to the Kaaba can hold worship ceremonies in mosques everywhere and slaughter livestock to distribute to relatives and friends. Muslims in Shanghai also gathered in various mosques on the morning of that day. In view of the fact that there are still more than 100,000 refugees in Shanghai awaiting relief, some Muslim youths have specifically organized a Muslim youth dinner party on this day, and invited imams to give lectures on religious doctrines, and all the remaining funds from the dinner party on that day will be donated to refugees. Any Muslim youth in Shanghai who wish to participate at that time can quickly send a letter to No. 33 Seymour Road to ensure delivery.

### Strike at Japanese Public Bus Company; Drivers and Female Ticket Sellers Demand Subsidies Unsuccessfully, Leading to Strike

According to the Continental News, the Huazhong Public Bus Company, a Japanese company operating in the public concession north of the Suzhou River and Zhabei, has recently experienced a strike. Some of the company's drivers and female ticket sellers demanded subsidies due to the high cost of living, but were unsuccessful, so they went on strike on the morning of last Thursday. It is reported that the company does not intend to reconcile, ordering employees who remain in their positions to work harder, and even dispatching office workers to act as drivers. Those who are unfamiliar with driving are acting as ticket sellers.

### Four Giant Ships Managed by Tianxiang to Change Routes Between Europe and the Far East; Other Giant Ships to Replace Routes Between the Far East and New York; All Ships Fly the Norwegian Flag and Have a Good Reputation

According to the Continental News, Tianxiang Shipping Company in Shanghai announced that four of the five old ships managed by the company operating between New York and the Far East have changed routes between Europe and the Far East, and will be replaced by four 10,000-ton ships from the Norwegian Williamson Shipping Company.

Three ships operating between New York and the Far East, the Talisman, the Thamesis, and the Torrens, are newly built and have sailed from Norway to Shanghai for their maiden voyages. The fourth ship, the Titania, was built earlier and previously sailed in European waters. The Titania left Shanghai in November last year and has arrived in New York. The Talisman arrived in Shanghai from Norway earlier in November and began operations, arriving in Lausanne. The Thamesis and the Torrens are scheduled to depart from Shanghai on the 21st of this month and the 20th of February, respectively. Only the Taoyang, an old ship of the company, still operates on this route. All ships fly the Norwegian flag and are among the few giant ships operating in the Far East, also capable of carrying 12 passengers.

### The Financial Sector Should Abandon Selfish Interests; Discrepancies Between Exchange Remittances and Surcharges Contradict Principles; Hoarding Cash Affects the Economy

After the fall of Shanghai, because funds from the interior concentrated in Shanghai and there was a lack of legitimate investment channels, speculation flourished. Foreign exchange, bids, public bonds, cotton yarn, rice, and grains were all objects of speculation. Eventually, foreign exchange depreciated sharply, from a price of eight to four. Other prices also broke through unprecedented records under the promotion of speculative waves. The price of one stone of white rice reached 40 yuan. People were unable to make a living, and cries of sorrow were everywhere. Social security was threatened, and national morality was almost completely degraded. The harm to the future of the War of Resistance is not insignificant. The Ministry of Finance's Ma telegram restricting the payment of deposits aims to stabilize the foundation of finance and eliminate the atmosphere of market speculation. However, it is heard that some who do not understand the situation are using certain institutions to hoard cash, engaging in the operation of their own interests. As for the exchange surcharge, in financial principles and the country's wartime financial policy, this should not happen. The government's measures to stabilize finance, and Ma's telegram restricting withdrawals, aim to prevent the escape of funds and stabilize the financial market. However, the occurrence of white exchange surcharges in Shanghai has caused the market's chips to have different values. The government's power is temporarily insufficient, causing a surcharge to be created in the market for no reason. Those who seek profit cannot prevent the escape of funds, but only allow a few people to manipulate it, seeking profits through surcharges. As for the government's wartime financial policy, it is very sound and thorough, and its protection of finance is benevolent and righteous. With the start of southwest construction, the movement to transfer capital to the interior is fierce, and the promotion of various savings campaigns aims to concentrate national strength and support the war situation. If all Chinese citizens are forced by the environment and cannot transfer a large amount of capital to the interior, they must not use wartime financial phenomena and overemphasize private interests, so as to affect the entire social economy.

### Sudden Increase in Fares for Passenger Ships of Various Countries

In the past six months, the passenger ships of various countries operating on the Far East route have recently increased their fares accordingly due to the high price of coal and rising prices. Passenger ticket prices have increased by more than one-third compared to before the war. Recently, overseas Chinese returning from Europe have gathered in France to take French ships to China because they are aware of the excessive burden of travel expenses, as French ships have the cheapest fares compared to passenger ships of various countries. However, according to overseas Chinese returning home, the current fares of French mail ships, the lowest class of general cabins, have increased a lot compared to before the war. Before the war, the fourth-class fare was only 16 pounds per person, but after the war, it gradually increased and has now risen to 25 pounds per person, equivalent to more than 1,100 yuan in Chinese legal currency. It is also heard that after January, it will increase again to 35 pounds per person.

### Restrictions on Carrying Cigarettes for Passengers Going to Ningbo

The Ningbo Inspection Office stipulates that each foreign passenger must not carry more than 100 cigarettes or 50 cigars. The container must be unsealed. If the amount is reached, even if it is a small number, it must be detained and transferred to the Cigarette Management Office, and the crime will be punished as private smuggling.

### Huang Qingping, Owner of Hengji Public Rice Shop, Kidnapped Yesterday; Traveling by Chartered Car Through Avenue Edward VII, Suddenly Intercepted and Abducted by Four Men

At 11:35 yesterday morning, a kidnapping occurred on Avenue Edward VII at the junction of the British and French concessions. The victim was Huang Qingping (also known as Ju Sheng, 49 years old), a rice broker and owner of Hengji Public Rice Shop at 25 Bailinan Road in Pudong. At the time, Huang had just returned from listening to market conditions at the Qinglian Pavilion Rice Market on Simalu and was returning to his residence at No. 3, Lane 1292, Chongqing Road, Avenue Edward VII, for dinner in his own chartered car. Unexpectedly, when he arrived in front of the Dahua Dance Hall at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Route Belles in the French Concession, four men who had been lying in wait there forced him into a car, No. 3697, parked on the corner of the road, and sped west. When the driver of the chartered car, Ding Afu from Jiangbei, saw this, he rushed back home to report. After Huang's daughter, Huang Ruxin, reported the situation to the Public Concession Police, they dispatched detectives to strictly investigate Huang's whereabouts. As the incident occurred in the French Concession, they notified the French Police. The French Police also received a report at the time and urgently notified all police posts to pay attention to the car. The Chief of the Criminal Division, Wan Langdeng, also ordered an investigation.

### General Closing Period Approaching; Various Industries Begin Preparations; Qianye (Money Exchange) Industry Plans to Formulate Business Handling Plan; Accommodating Overdrafts on Transactions

Since the Qianye Industry Association decided that February 7th would be the general closing period for the 28th year of the Republic of China, various industries have already begun preparations for the general closing, such as collecting customer accounts, temporarily suspending new accounts, allocating funds, and waiting. The Qianye Industry Association has scheduled an executive committee meeting on the 25th of this month to formulate a business handling plan for before and after the general closing period, and then submit it to the members' standing committee meeting on February 2nd for implementation. As for the transaction amounts that have been released by various banks, according to past practice, all debts must be cleared before the general closing. Now, in order to support the national goods industry, accommodation will be granted to domestic goods factories and firms. A four-day holiday is scheduled from February 8th to handle the general closing, and business will resume on the 12th. As for the Shanghai financial market, it remains stable as ever. The money market for foreign exchange has no signs of tension, so there is no problem for various industries to safely pass the general closing period.

### Public Concession Factories Employ 210,000 Workers

According to the Municipal Council, the total number of workers employed by Chinese and foreign factories in the Public Concession and the extra-territorial road construction areas in western Shanghai last month was 211,500, an increase of 62,040 compared to 149,460 in the same month of the previous year. In terms of factories, there are more than 160 more than the previous month, and up to 1,000 more than the same period of the previous year, but most of them are small industries.

### Preparations in Shanghai for Memorial Service for Wu Peifu; Coffin Scheduled to Be Placed in Nianhua Temple; Staff for Memorial Service Already Assigned

General Wu Fuwei passed away suddenly on December 4th last year due to a minor tooth ailment at his residence in Shijin Garden, Beiping. The news shocked the country. After the Lugou Bridge Incident, General Wu resided in Ping until last year. A certain party wanted to win him over at all costs, using both enticements and threats. The General did not dishonor his integrity and was loyal to the country. While resting quietly in his residence in the old capital and devoting himself to self-cultivation, he passed away unexpectedly. The country has lost this pillar, and everyone mourns and regrets. It is learned that Wu's residence in Beiping is scheduled to move the coffin to Nianhua Temple in Beiping on the 24th of this month, and then choose a auspicious day to return the coffin to his ancestral home in Penglai, Shandong, for burial.

Shanghai Branch for Funeral Established

Tao Jiayao and Zhao Xien have been assigned as preparation directors. The accountants are Li Lisheng, Wang Zhongli, Chen Jingyan, and three others. Zhao Jing'an is in charge of affairs. Once preparations are completed, it will be announced in the newspaper.

Brief Biography of General Fuwei

General Wu Fuwei, whose name is Peifu and courtesy name is Ziyu, was from Penglai, Shandong. He was 66 years old. He joined the army early and traveled in the military for 40 years. During the Sino-Japanese War, he studied at the Kaiping Military Academy and then graduated from the Baoding Surveying and Mapping Hall. He served in the Wuwei Army guarding Gubeikou and served as a Yantai Commissioner in the Staff Office of the Beiyang Army. He was later appreciated by former President Cao Kun and appointed Deputy Inspector of Zhili, Shandong, and Henan and Inspector of Hubei, Hunan, Zhili, Shandong, and Henan, and awarded the title of General Fuwei, Army General. His achievements and reputation shook the world. Although he experienced many changes, his strength and heroic spirit were admired by people at home and abroad. Later, he lived in the old capital, engaged in self-cultivation, lectured on morality and virtue for many years, and devoted himself to writing. During the August 13th all-out war of resistance, General Wu was determined to serve the country, especially to recover the country's sovereignty. After suffering from illness for eight days, he passed away due to a mistake in tooth extraction.

### Nanshi to Become the Second "Bad Land"; Opening of Two Iron Gates Unconfirmed; But Local Gangs and Gambling Dens Have Already Obtained Fake Licenses

The "Citizen Certificate" issued by the Nanshi Chinese Office has recently been suddenly banned by the Japanese. Outsiders who do not know the inside story have made many speculations. It is heard that the Japanese Nanshi Special Affairs Agency has scheduled a meeting today to discuss remedial measures for the banned "Citizen Certificate." As for the rumor that the Xinbeimen and Nanyangqiao iron gates will be opened today (the 15th), it has not been confirmed. According to the Japanese, the date is not far off. It is heard that before the opening of the iron gates in Nanshi, the Japanese puppet agents have already obtained many licenses for local gangs, gambling tables, flower clubs, and listening devices, with as many as twenty or thirty licenses each. A large number of rogues and local bullies are working hard to secure them. It is expected that after Nanshi is opened in the near future, it will become the second "bad land" of western Shanghai.

### Summary of Important Administrative Matters of the Municipal Council in 1939 (Continued)

Gazette Published Once a Month

Regarding the printing and distribution of the Council's Gazette, although foreign taxpayers raised opinions at the annual meeting, the Council organized a special committee to review the matter. As a result, it was considered that the current methods adopted by the Council were not inappropriate and did not need to be changed. Subsequently, at the end of the year, it was decided to change the Gazette to be published once a month from the beginning of this year, but the information on municipal affairs would not be less than in the past.

Relocation of British Army Remains to Hongqiao

The remains of British soldiers who died in battle during the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom period in the late Qing Dynasty were buried in the Nanshi Cemetery. In the past, the Council decided to relocate all coffins to the Hongqiao Cemetery. This section has been stated in the Council's annual report of the previous year. The relocation work was completed last year, and a monument was erected on the new cemetery.

Collection of Refugee Donations and Allocation of Uses

Last year, refugee donations continued to be collected at various entertainment venues, and the total amount paid to the Council throughout the year was 356,841.33 yuan. Together with the balance of 35,647.34 yuan carried over from the previous year, and the remainder of 53,684.41 yuan from the rice sales surplus, the total of the two figures was 446,353.08 yuan, which could be used to relieve refugees. The Joint Committee of Shanghai Foreign Charities requested to allocate 20% of this entertainment donation. The Council approved this, and decided that after deducting the expenses incurred by various departments of the Council for undertaking relief work and setting aside a part of the reserve fund, 80% of the remaining amount would be allocated to the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, and 20% would be supplied to the Joint Committee of Shanghai Foreign Charities. As of the end of November, the relief funds allocated totaled 380,869.79 yuan.

Restrictions on Placing Coffins in Funeral Homes

At the beginning of last year, the issue of coffin placement homes within the Concession was still extremely complex. There were many applications to establish coffin placement homes in the residential areas of western Shanghai. These petitions were all rejected. As for those that had been opened before, they could not be arbitrarily expanded. A certain coffin placement home was ordered by the Council to demolish unauthorized buildings. New coffin placement wooden houses were built around the roads outside the western district, and their locations were also restricted by the Council.

Rickshaw Rent Not Allowed to Increase

Regarding the issue of public rickshaw fares, the Council organized a special committee at the beginning of last year to review the request submitted by the Rickshaw Industry Association and consider various related facts. As a result, the Council Board approved the committee's proposal not to allow an increase in fares. However, this issue was raised again for consideration at the end of the year.

Temple Fair

Last year's Jing'an Temple Fair was still held on private grounds on Great Western Road to avoid crowds.

Service Awards for Fire Department

The Council decided to award a long service medal to the volunteer reserve team of the fire brigade, with conditions similar to those for the long service medals of the Volunteer Corps and the Special Police. Fire department staff who have served for 20 years and are capable may also be awarded medals by the Council.

Consular Court Hears Two Cases

At the beginning of last year, the US Consul General Gauss, the British Consul General Felippo, and the Japanese Consul General Miura were elected as judges of the Consular Court, with Gauss as the President of the Court. Between October and November, the Consular Court heard a case against a former detective of the Police Department for dismantling the Council. The detective was dismissed by the Bureau for violating regulations, losing part of his accumulated retirement pay. The Consular Court then ruled to return the case to the Bureau for consideration of changing the punishment. The Bureau has followed the court's handling. Between November and December, another case against a former Russian team member of the Volunteer Corps for dismantling the Council was also accepted by the Consular Court, but the trial was not concluded by the end of the year.

Changes in Senior Staff

The Council's former Secretary-General Feixindun retired on June 30th last year. Foreign taxpayers expressed their praise to Feixindun at the annual meeting held in the spring. Felippo, the Council's General Office, was promoted to the position of General Office and Secretary-General from July 1st last year. Major Ford, the former Director of the Finance Department of the Council, retired after serving his term on June 12th last year. Foreign taxpayers also gave a eulogy to Ford at the annual meeting. He was promoted from June 13th. (To be continued)

### Airmail Postage in Occupied Areas to Increase from Today

Airmail to Anqing, Jiujiang, Wuhu, Hankou, Wuchang, Beiping, Tianjin, Jinan, Datong, Zhangjiakou, Shanhaiguan, Qingdao, Tongshan, Xuzhou, Bengbu, Shijiazhuang, Taiyuan, Zhangde, and Kaifeng, the flat rate was originally 5 cents, including the airmail fee of 2 jiao, totaling 2 jiao 5 fen. The Shanghai Postal Administration has now stipulated that from today onwards, the airmail fee will be changed to 2 jiao 5 fen, and the total with the flat rate will be 3 jiao, the same as the airmail fee to the southwest. If registered and express mail, the additional fees should be paid separately. The airmail fee to Japan will also be increased from 3 jiao 5 fen to 4 jiao 4 fen from today onwards, and the total with the flat rate will be 4 jiao 9 fen. If it exceeds 20 cm, it will be added successively. This fee increase is unrelated to the rumored postage increase.

### Widespread Rumor that Chen Gongbo and Others Have Gone to Hong Kong

Reports from the mainland state that, according to widespread rumors in this city last night, Chen Gongbo and two others recently disagreed with Wang Jingwei. Chen reportedly departed for Hong Kong on December 31st of last year, and it is said he will not return here. The other two, Gao Zhongwu and Tao Xisheng, also reportedly followed Chen south in the days after. It is rumored that all three are now in Hong Kong. As for the reason for their disagreement, the details are unknown.

### Russian Emigrants in Shanghai Celebrate New Year's Day Yesterday

Yesterday was the Russian New Year's Day. All Russian emigrants in Shanghai celebrated enthusiastically. The Russian New Year differs from that of other countries due to customs, much like the Chinese Lunar New Year. The Russian Christmas falls on January 8th, while the New Year is on January 14th. Russian churches also held celebrations and commemorations as usual yesterday.

### Suggestions for Suppressing Rice Prices: Legal and Administrative Measures Should Be Taken Simultaneously, with the Joint Efforts of the Authorities and Residents

— Li

Since the authorities of the two concessions restricted rice prices and issued public notices stating that anyone found monopolizing or manipulating the market would not be protected, and their hoarded goods would be confiscated, the measures can be said to be quite strict. At the same time, public figures concerned about the people's food have organized a Food Adjustment Association, trying to raise funds to order foreign rice to curb the ambitions of monopolizers and manipulators. For a time, rice prices on the surface did not exceed the limited price. However, in reality, it was still loose on the surface but tight underneath. It can be seen that these conscienceless rice weevils are still operating secretly. If members of society only complain about the high price of rice and do not work together to try to eat cheap rice, I am afraid that relying solely on the Food Adjustment Association to order foreign rice will not achieve the goal in this period of high foreign exchange rates. But what is the right approach? According to my personal opinion:

(1) Establish more rice distribution points at low prices. The matter of transporting and selling foreign rice is now being handled by the Food Adjustment Association. However, for ordinary people, it is not easy to come up with half of the fixed price of a bag of rice at once, so they still cannot enjoy the benefits. It is necessary to set up as many low-price distribution points as possible in suitable locations to meet the needs of all parties, so that the rice weevils' rice will always be hoarded in warehouses. Except for being moth-eaten and moldy, or being sold at a low price according to the estimated value, no one will bother with it. Then the rice weevils will naturally feel that they have nowhere to sell their tricks and will no longer hoard. Although it is well known that domestic rice-producing areas have had an unusually good harvest this year, why order foreign rice and settle the bill in foreign exchange? Isn't the price almost the same as that of domestic rice? But it should be known that domestic rice is not so expensive in the producing areas. It is rumored that the price of rice in Wuhu differs greatly across the river. On one side, it costs about 20 yuan per dan, while on the other, it is less than 10 yuan. The difference is so great, and it can be understood that the reason is whether or not it is controlled by special forces. As for shipping it to Shanghai, a procurement certificate from special forces is also required, but it can only be shipped to Hongkou. If you want to move it south of the Suzhou Creek, you still need to find a way. Therefore, even if the rice weevils try to raise the price of rice and calculate the benefits, it is far less than the embezzlement of special forces. The more money these embezzlers get, the more Chinese compatriots die tragically. The bombing of several places, the planes and bombs, are largely made possible by this kind of money. Then, while eating expensive domestic rice, we still have to suffer cruel harm. It is better to eat foreign rice and be at peace physically and mentally. This is originally a last resort. Unless a person is insane, how can they willingly let rights leak out? (To be continued)

### Plainclothes Chinese Detectives Commit Robbery, A Glove with a Detective Number is Left Behind, Arrest, Dismissal, Interrogation, and Summons for Further Interrogation

Wu Shaorong, a native of Haimen, who lives in a bungalow with no number on Teisdelang Road in the French Concession's West District, was suddenly broken into by a bandit at 7:00 PM on December 1st of last year. The bandit, holding a flashlight and pretending to have a handgun, forbade any outcry. The bandit then rummaged through the boxes and cabinets, stealing over thirty yuan in cash and slapping Wu's wife before fleeing. Afterwards, the victim, Wu Shaorong, found a black velvet thread

glove

left behind by the bandit.

He took the glove to the French police station to report the incident and request an investigation. The detective chief found number 1033 inside the glove, which belonged to Chinese detective Gao Guangyi, number 1033. The detective was brought in for questioning. He confessed that Chinese detective number 1022, who lives near the victim's home, went to find him that night. Number 1022's wife said that he was in the victim's house. However, when the detective chief went to look, he could not find number 1022, but only saw the victim's daughter and others playing mahjong. He then confiscated a mahjong score sheet.

The detective chief investigated

and found that Chinese detective number 1022 had already been dismissed for misconduct. He then ordered the dismissal and detention of Chinese detective Gao Guangyi, number 1033. The day before yesterday afternoon, Gao was sent to the First Criminal Division of the Special Second Court, where Judge Miao Qingbang interrogated him. Police lawyer Yuan Jiahuang explained the case and requested a postponement for investigation. Then, the plaintiff, Wu Shaorong, recounted the circumstances of the robbery. Gao's testimony was the same as that given at the police station, denying the robbery. The court reviewed the testimonies and ordered a postponement to summon witnesses for further interrogation on the morning of the 23rd at 9:00 AM. The defendant was detained.

### Counterfeiters Receive Separate Sentences

Chinese Detective Wang Chengying, Detective Xu Decheng, and Detective Xia Shutang of the Gordon Road Police Station received a tip from an informant on the 22nd of last month and cracked a case involving Shandong native Zhang Keqin, Liu Xueke, and Tianjin native Liu Jizhong, who were selling large quantities of counterfeit banknotes at No. 12, Lane 66, Beijing Road, and No. 36, Taianli, Tiantong Road. 2,660 counterfeit banknotes of Farmers Bank, Communications Bank, and Central Bank, each valued at five yuan, were confiscated, along with suspects Pan Wenbao from Pudong, a woman named Liu Sunshi, and others. They were taken to the police station and sent to the First Special District Court. The four suspects, including Pan Wenbao, hired lawyer Yu Enliang to defend them. The defendant Zhang Keqin confessed that Zhang Baolin and Cao Zida, who are at large, were the masterminds of the case. Each defendant was ordered to be returned to custody to await sentencing. The day before yesterday, Judge Huang Risheng presided over the trial and sentenced Zhang Keqin to eight years of imprisonment, Liu Xueke to five years, and Liu Jizhong to three years and six months, as warnings. Pan Wenbao, Liu Sunshi, and Zhang Wangshi were all acquitted and released. The confiscated counterfeit banknotes were confiscated and destroyed according to the list.

### A Rogue Who Dined and Dashed Stabs a Waiter to Death

Chuan Hebing, a waiter from Wuxi at the Dongsheng Restaurant at No. 18 North Shansi Road, had a quarrel with rogues near the Suzhou Creek Pier because they refused to pay for food and drinks. This led to resentment. At 1:45 PM on the 8th of this month, Chuan went out on business and was attacked by these rogues near the pier, who stabbed him fatally with a triangular knife. Afterwards, Chinese detectives Shang Wu and Zhu Mengwei of the Hui Police Station investigated and arrested the murderers Zhang Xueheng from Jiangbei, Cheng Lianguan from Changzhou, and Liu Jirong, all of whom were young rogues. A triangular knife discarded by Zhang was also retrieved from the Suzhou Creek. They were sent to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. The day before yesterday morning, Judge Huang Risheng presided over the trial and, after a clear investigation, ordered them to be returned to custody to await sentencing.

### Major Drug Case at Roosevelt Wharf: Police Strictly Arresting the Masterminds, Crackdown on an Organization in Baoxingli, A Total of Thirteen Arrests

At around 11 PM on the 28th of last month, the French Concession Police Department cracked a major drug case at Roosevelt Wharf No. 5 (previously mistakenly reported as Taikoo Wharf No. 3). At the time, a total of 160 kilograms of opium were seized, totaling 2,460 taels, worth

over ten thousand yuan.

Three suspects were arrested at the scene and taken to the police station for a thorough investigation. Due to the seriousness of the case, the details were not disclosed. According to the news reporter's investigation, the three arrested at the time were Yang Tianxiang (Shandong), Li Huaian (Tianjin), and Ma Ji (Shandong), all of whom were arrested for picking up the opium at the wharf. After interrogation, they confessed that the main organization was located in the French Concession

inside Baoxingli

at No. 32. The police sent detectives there and arrested ten staff members: Li Shufang, Wang Jinhai, Wen Xingren, Wang Chunnian, Guo Zhiyuan, Sun Zhaozhong, Wu Zhengrong, Wu Wanxiang, Chen Yushan, and Liu Baolai. Account books and other items were confiscated. After a thorough interrogation, it was found that there were still

important masterminds

Li Jian (Shandong) and a Western foreigner, who had already been interrogated and escaped. The police have now issued strict orders for their arrest. It is now known that the police sent the above thirteen suspects and the seized opium to the First Criminal Division of the Special Second Court the day before yesterday. Police lawyer Yuan Jiahuang gave an account of the proceedings, stating that because the case

situation is complicated

and the fleeing masterminds still need to be arrested, a postponement was requested. Presiding Judge Miao Qingbang reviewed the submissions and briefly interrogated each suspect before ordering a postponement to the 27th of this month for interrogation. The defendants were returned to custody.

### Butcher Shop Employee Stabs a Vendor to Death

Liu Chubao, a 25-year-old from Jiangbei, who lived at No. 5, Lane 31, Seymour Road, made a living selling beef at the vegetable market. At 10:15 AM yesterday, Sai Shipai (28), an employee of a butcher shop from Anhui, went to Liu's stall to collect a debt. The two began to argue. Sai, in a fit of anger, grabbed a beef-cutting knife from the stall and stabbed Liu in the head several times, causing injuries to the right neck and back of the head, causing heavy bleeding. Liu fell to the ground in pain. Afterwards, the police arrived and arrested Sai. The injured was sent to Baolong Hospital, where he died at 3:30 PM after failing to respond to treatment.

### Moral Re-Armament Representative from Burma to Broadcast Tonight at the Gospel Radio Station

Since the completion of the Burma Road, Burma has become a close neighbor to our country and an important route for foreign transportation during the war. Recently, the Burmese delegation came to China, and the people of Chongqing welcomed them warmly. The close relationship between the two countries is evident. The World Moral Re-Armament Assembly will be held in the United States this time, and Ms. Ma Ningtai, a representative from Burma, traveled a long way to attend. Ms. Ma has traveled to Europe and the United States several times, and her moral cultivation is very profound, and she is respected by representatives from various countries. After the meeting in the United States, she first went to Japan on her way back to promote the Moral Re-Armament movement. It is said that many Japanese aristocrats have been changed under her guidance. For example, a certain baron's family can gather with their children and servants every morning to reflect on themselves. In large stores in Tokyo, all employees gather together every morning to listen to God quietly. Ms. Ma has now come to Shanghai and will carry out Moral Re-Armament work in the free areas of China and other Asian countries. Tonight (the 15th) at 7:30 PM, during the time when Dr. Wang Wanbai gives a lecture on the Gospel Radio Station (frequency 760), Ms. Ma Ningtai will be invited to broadcast a speech.

### French Public Works Bureau Employee, Bureau Staff Member, and Driver Arrested for Impersonation and Fraud

Ge Jianfeng, 24, from Ningbo, worked as a driver for a Westerner in the French Public Works Bureau. Recently, he impersonated a health inspection officer and demanded five yuan from Wang Jinlong's small factory at No. 100 Caishi Street under the guise of an inspection. A few days ago, he demanded ten yuan from Wang again, but Wang discovered that Ge was an imposter and reported him to the French police. The police arrested Ge, and the day before yesterday, he was sent to the First Division of the Second Special Court. The police lawyer explained the case and requested a postponement for investigation. The defendant admitted the impersonation and fraud. Judge Miao reviewed the confession and ordered a postponement for further investigation. The defendant was detained.

### Palm and its Products are Prohibited from Transportation

The Ministry of Economic Affairs telegraphed the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, stating that palm trees do not belong to the hemp category in botany. As for palm and its products, the Ministry of Military Affairs was telegraphed to check whether they had military uses. The Ministry of Military Affairs has now telegraphed back that palm and its products are related to military use and should be prohibited from transportation to avoid supplying the enemy. All trade associations are hereby informed.

### Social Miscellany

At the Hengfeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory on Maran Road in the French Concession, at around noon yesterday, two workers, Jiang Maoyin, 32, and Shi Ayun, 20, both from Ningbo, were using a machine to starch cloth in the cloth room when the axle derailed. The two were knocked to the ground. Jiang's hands were crushed, and Shi's left leg was crushed. Bleeding was unstoppable. The factory sent them to the hospital for treatment.

Chinese and Western detectives from the Hui Police Station received a tip that several bandits were hiding in the Nanyang Hotel at No. 294 North Zhejiang Road. So at noon the day before yesterday, they secretly went to the address and arrested five people: Zhang Haihai, Cai Daodao, Wang Ajin, Tang Guien, and Zhang Agen, all from Tongzhou. A fake handgun was confiscated. They were all taken to the police station. The day before yesterday, they were sent to the First Special Court for detention. Judge Huang ordered a postponement for one week for further verification.

Qian Zhiyu, a farmer from Xiaolijiashai, Luobiegen Road, West Shanghai, accidentally started a fire while cooking dinner at around 7:00 PM the night before last. The fire quickly broke through the roof, and the flames lit up the sky. Fortunately, the villagers tried their best to put out the fire, which was extinguished after about two hours. Five tiled bungalows were burned down, and several others were damaged.

Fu Qingyou, 34, from Yancheng, a worker at the Tongtai Truck Company on Pingjili Road in the French Concession, accidentally fell off the truck while driving with the army to the Waibaidu Bridge at around 2:00 PM yesterday.

He died at 5:00 PM after failing to respond to treatment.

Deng Qi, a young woman from Suzhou staying at the Tongshang Hotel at No. 184 Avenue Edward VII, suddenly stabbed herself in the throat with scissors in her room at 2:45 AM yesterday. She was discovered and taken to the hospital for treatment, and her life is in danger. The woman is 28 years old and had just arrived in Shanghai from Suzhou. She had been staying at the hotel for only three days. The reason for her suicide is said to be the double pressure of divorce and economic problems.

### Weather Report

The Zikawei Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday stated that Shandong is cloudy and cold, with localized snowfall and strong northwest to north winds. Here and in the East China Sea, there will be fog in the morning and fairly strong northwest to northeast winds. Also, in the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in this city was 48.2 and the lowest was 34.7. On the same day last year, the highest was 58.3 and the lowest was 28.4.
The cooked water industry understands the greater good and denies price increases.

### The Cooked Water Industry Understands the Greater Good and Denies Price Increases. For the Convenience of the Public, We Will Not Seek Petty Profits.

The Shanghai Cooked Water Industry Association held an emergency meeting last night, attended by over 40 representatives, directors, and supervisors from various districts. After the customary formalities, Chairman Zhang Delong reported that Ji Jianmin and Yu Liyang, who are not members of the industry, had falsely used the name of the cooked water industry to publish a price increase notice in the newspaper. The association could not find their address and its legal advisor, Yin Tinghua, has repeatedly published warnings in the newspaper. Shi Xingli proposed that the association was established to seek the welfare of the public. Although coal prices have soared, we can only temporarily endure the pain and maintain business. If prices are raised again, it will increase the burden on ordinary people and have a negative impact on citizens. If households use coal briquette stoves to boil water, the direct business losses to the industry and indirectly the citizens are prone to fires, endangering everyone. The proposal was unanimously approved to resolutely oppose another price increase. Wang Zhijian then expressed his opinion, hoping that colleagues in the industry would walk on the path of light. A letter should be sent to the Citizens' Association, Taxpayers' Association, and Special District Citizens' Association and other groups, requesting assistance in purchasing coal in bulk to compensate for the losses. Yin Tingsen and others voluntarily donated money for advertising to deny another price increase.

### The Truth About the Heinous Crime of Bandits Plotting to Kill a Korean Woman: The Deceased's Husband is Usually Law-Abiding and Has Never Sold Drugs.

Regarding yesterday's report in this newspaper about the robbery and attempted murder of a Korean woman on Father Zhaolus Road, the deceased's husband has sent a letter stating the truth as follows: To the esteemed Chief Editor of Shen Bao, I respectfully write this letter. Today, I read a news report in your newspaper about the murder of my wife, and the headline, "Extortion of Bribes Failed, Leading to Plot to Murder Drug-Dealing Korean Woman," is inconsistent with the facts. I hereby declare the following: I have been working as a ticket inspector for the British-owned Tram Company for 17 years. I have always been

honest and impartial

in my work, which is well-known. Everyone, Chinese and foreigners alike, who knows me believes this. This is the nonsense of the arrested criminal. The criminal also admitted yesterday in the First Special Court that no drugs were found in my home. This is strong evidence. If a carelessly spoken confession is used as a headline in large print, then I will be unjustly wronged, and the loss to my reputation will be irreparable for generations. After my wife was murdered, there was not a single cent left in the house to pay for the funeral. I borrowed 300 yuan from the Tram Company. In addition, friends and others, because I am usually law-abiding and rely solely on my monthly salary of 100 yuan from the company to make a living, know that I must be in great difficulty after this tragedy. They generously offered their help, so I was able to raise more than 600 yuan to complete the funeral arrangements.

My heart is still in pain

and has not been eased. If my family were indeed drug dealers, our finances would not be so difficult. Also, the report said that the Gao surnamed criminal had been hired by my family and then dismissed, which is also completely inaccurate. I have only hired female servants many years ago and have never hired male servants at all. Moreover, in recent years, due to salary cuts in the company, income has not covered expenses, and my wife has personally handled everything in the house without hiring a female servant. The case is currently under trial in the Second Special Court.

The full details will come to light in the future. However, I am sincerely afraid that the outside world will misunderstand the truth. I hereby specially send this letter, requesting that it be published in an important position, like a news report, so that the truth can be clarified for all. I wish you good health. Luo Yu respectfully writes, January 14th. Also, the report said that I am Luo Quexin. Luo Quexin is the name of my murdered wife, and my name is Luo Yu. This is hereby corrected.

Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation

### The Spirit of Mutual Assistance in the Four Matters of Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation and the Enjoyment of Life

— Letian

—Like "Good Scenery" Doesn't Cost a Penny—

Since the outbreak of the European War in September 1939, new knowledge and insights on the cultivation of the spirit in advanced Western countries have been used by world-saving heroes in a timely manner to save themselves. How could we Chinese, who have endured national disasters, and our people who have worked hard to survive, not have a color of unhappiness? However, if we think about how willpower can overcome the environment, and we feel that we can turn bad luck into good, the new method of celebrating the New Year should be different from the past. If our people are determined to assist the central government, escape danger and enter a happy environment, they should first break through the three major difficulties of "anger," "suffering," and "silence." This is the newest medicine for my compatriots to turn into good luck in the 29th year of the Republic. I happened to observe it from the Western allies of the Second European War, and I am happy to share it with others and not keep it a secret.

First, anger: Our Chinese proverb calls being angry "getting angry," which coincides with the Western saying. According to medical principles, very few people, regardless of gender, age, or ethnicity, are naturally angry. Anger is a temporary abnormality, mostly due to physical fatigue. "Getting angry" is like having a fever, which is the body's automatic response to the environment, just like the "safety valve" of a steam engine. When the internal heat is too full, it can automatically open the valve and release the heat. When a dog is healthy, the dog owner can stroke it at will and the dog will be happy. If the dog is injured and in pain, it will bark wildly if touched slightly. The same is true when people are too tired and "get angry." It's a pity that people who get angry generally do not admit that physical fatigue is the reason for getting angry. In general, there are two strategies for human safety. The lower strategy is to let it get angry, and the upper strategy is to reduce physical fatigue by resting. One theory is that avoiding stimulating things such as pepper can also prevent anger. Another theory is that a daily action log, writing down the words or actions that easily make the other party angry, and then reflecting on oneself so as not to get angry again, is in line with the theory of mental analysis scholars in treating diseases.

Second, suffering: Whenever a person encounters irresolvable suffering, such as being determined to save people and using their minds or abilities to relieve the suffering of compatriots or companions, they can often forget their own suffering. Or comparing oneself to the suffering of others makes it easier to understand one's own suffering.

Third, silence: In families during times of famine and chaos, men are either loyal to the country or working hard to make a living, and women are more likely to feel silent because they cannot enjoy the joy of reunion. Even worse are those who are widowed, widowed, orphaned, and lonely due to the chaos. At this time, to break through the difficulty of silence, one should first find a career or job that suits one's body and mind. People must work hard so that their spirits have a place to live, and all worries and fears will naturally have no way to occur. As for women, it is best to help others. For example, during the European War, women were knitting lines to make cold clothes for soldiers and refugees, which is a key to relieving silence.

There is no eternally unchanging bad luck, nor is there an eternally unchanging good luck. Misfortune and fortune depend on each other, and they circulate day and night. A new luck is coming, and when the stripping reaches its limit, it recovers. The above-mentioned three essentials of spiritual enjoyment can be shared with families in our poor country. It is said that "good scenery doesn't cost a penny."

### Snake Skin Handbags

— Qin Jiaju

Longhumen is a Cantonese dish of the highest quality, and everyone has probably heard of its name for a long time. But snake skin handbags are probably still little known to people in Shanghai. This is a specialty of Haiphong. After they eat the delicious snake meat, the remaining skin is used to make handbags. Each handbag is made of about four or five pieces of snake skin with different patterns, so it is impossible to find two handbags with the same pattern. So in Haiphong, Shanghai ladies all have one in hand to show novelty. The price of this kind of handbag is not expensive, and the quality is very strong and durable, and it can also avoid getting stained, so many men also use it as a wallet. However, putting it in a bag and being too close to the body seems a little worrying. I think curious people in Shanghai must also want to get one to play with, at least to learn something. Unfortunately, I can't bring too many on the boat, otherwise it would be a very good gift to give to women.

### Small Tips for the Household

— Shijie

Burn the oiled paper from a worn-out umbrella into ash, mix with sesame oil, and apply to scalds from boiling water to prevent festering.

After leather shoes get wet, crumple newspaper into pieces and stuff them inside. This not only absorbs moisture but also helps maintain the shoe's original shape.

To make socks last longer, it's best to have several pairs and change them daily. Soak the worn socks in water, rub with soap, leave for three hours, then rinse with water and dry. This not only cleans them but also prevents damage to the fibers.

If black canvas shoes fade, brush them with soot from the bottom of a pot using a bristle brush, and they will be as black as new.

If leather shoes lack shine, wipe them with lemon two or three times to make them gleam brightly.

New porcelainware, if boiled in saltwater, can be made durable for a long time.

### One Week Economic Menu

— Ms. Hua Ying

Meat prices are outrageously expensive; pork, beef, and mutton are all two or three times more expensive than before, making them truly unaffordable. As for chicken and duck, needless to say, ordinary families don't have the luxury of eating them. Therefore, besides buying some pork and beef to shred and stir-fry each day, we must eat more vegetables. Among the vegetables, large green cabbages are delicious after being hit by frost, and there's also a type of small rosette bok choy, which can offer a change of pace. Although it may sometimes have a slightly bitter taste, if you add more sugar and oil and cook it thoroughly, the flavor isn't bad. Speaking of vegetable prices, they also cost around ten cents of subsidiary currency per pound, which is certainly different from the past, but compared to meat prices, they are still much cheaper.

Monday

Stir-fried shredded pork with dried bean curd sheets, sweet and sour fried ribbonfish, stir-fried rosette bok choy, jellyfish, pickled radish

Tuesday

Celery beef soup, cellophane noodles with white fish head, braised tofu with spinach, pickled mustard greens with soybean sprouts

Wednesday

Soybean stewed pig's feet, shrimp and egg drop soup, stir-fried green cabbage with fried dough sticks, braised radish slices

Thursday

Curried beef slices, scallion-baked small yellow croaker, scallions braised tofu in Hangzhou style, braised cabbage

Friday

Glass noodles with shredded pork soup, braised yellow croaker with pickled mustard greens, braised vegetarian ten-delicacy dish, dry-mixed shredded bean curd with celery

Saturday

Braised sliced mutton, glass noodles with green fish slices, stir-fried wheat gluten with shrimp roe, pickled mustard greens with mung bean sprouts

Sunday

Fermented bean curd meat, stewed ribbonfish, alfalfa, stir-fried radish

### On Ferries

— Qi Yu

As everyone knows, ferries are set up to compensate for the inadequacy of bridges. Usually, at wide river mouths where land transportation is convenient, the construction of bridges is a huge project or too costly, so ferries are established. A single boat regularly travels between the two banks, ferrying passengers, which is both convenient and cost-effective, and truly an important auxiliary to inland transportation.

The river networks of Jiangnan are crisscrossed, and transportation is relatively developed, so there are particularly many ferries. Especially in the counties of Suzhou and Wuxi, because they are close to Taihu Lake and have many harbors, ferries are everywhere. Usually, you only need to spend one copper coin to save yourself a long trek, so why not do it?

In modern times, with the advocacy of science and the increasing development of transportation, the use of ferries has become more widespread and complete. Taking the ferries on the Huangpu River as an example, they used to be civilian boats. Whenever the tide rose or the waves surged, the boatmen had to work hard to cross this wide river, and the passengers were terrified. But since there have been ferries, this kind of danger no longer exists.

But ferries are not only for ferrying people, but also for ferrying cars and trains. For example, Zhenjiang and Yangzhou are separated by a large river, but the cars on the Zhenjiang-Yangzhou highway can still travel directly because they use civilian boats to ferry them across. Another example is the pre-war direct train service between Shanghai and Pingjin. The connection between the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway and the Tianjin-Pukou Railway from Nanjing to Pukou relied on ferries in the Yangtze River. The freight cars were first driven onto the ferry, ferried to the other side, and then connected to the railway so that the freight cars could drive off. There could be no simpler way. If a bridge were to be built over the Yangtze River, how easy would that be?

At present, the government is actively developing the inland areas, especially highway transportation is the most important, and ferries are also a very important auxiliary, which should not be neglected.

### Food and Health

— Cao Lingyou

Whether we eat properly has a great impact on our health. For the convenience of narration, I will briefly describe it in three points.

(1) Mood While Eating

Whenever and wherever you eat, you should always be filled with joy in your heart. It is absolutely harmful to the body to eat with anger or anxiety.

(2) Method of Eating

After the food enters the mouth, it should be chewed slowly and carefully, and then swallowed. The most standard chewing should be done thirty-two times. Swallowing food hard with soup or tea is not only useless, but will cause all kinds of stomach problems.

(3) Nutritional Value of Food

Food should always be distributed evenly. It is not advisable to eat one kind of dish every day, and the variety of food per meal should not be too much. Two or three kinds are the most suitable, so as not to hinder digestion. According to the research of hygienists, the nutritional value of eggs and vegetables is far above that of delicacies.

Dear Contributor: Thank you very much for your wonderful work in December of last year. The payment has now been settled. Please come to the accounting department from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM on the 16th to the 20th of this month, with your seal, to collect it.

### Ningbo's Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation

— Zhu Tingyun

Since all the seaports were successively blockaded, Ningbo has become the only transportation line to the inland areas, and the traffic of travelers and freight is quite busy. Although Ningbo also suffered the same bombing as other places this spring, it has long been rebuilt from the rubble into a new city appearance, which is even more prosperous than before. This time, the author stayed in Ningbo for half a month and conducted a brief survey of Ningbo's clothing, food, housing, and transportation.

Currently, the most popular clothing in Ningbo is army uniforms in grass green and light yellow. Whether on the streets or in public places, men and women can easily be seen wearing them at any time and anywhere. Even children wear them, with cloth leggings, flat-top haircuts, and cotton overcoats, showing a spirited and enterprising attitude. In addition, short overcoats made of domestic leather are also worn by many people. As for ordinary clothes, they are indeed much simpler. Foreign clothing materials also occupy the majority, but so-called modern fashions with bare chests and arms are hard to find.

In terms of food, various daily necessities are indeed much cheaper. The price of rice is only more than twenty yuan per stone, which is closely related to people's livelihood. As for various vegetables, because they are closer to the countryside, they are naturally cheap. Fresh shrimp that are still jumping, winter bamboo shoots just dug out of the bamboo garden, are both fresh and cheap. However, the prices of marine fish such as fresh ribbonfish are high because fishing boats cannot export to catch fish in the waters of Zhoushan and other places, and they have to rely on Shanghai, which is indeed a matter of great sadness and indignation. The only fruits are the tangerines from Huangyan and the golden bridge, which are also delicious. Among the local products, "Ningbo rice cakes" are the most famous, followed by laver cakes, square cakes, bean paste candies, and lotus root silk candies, which are also very exquisite. As for restaurants, most of them are naturally Ningbo-style restaurants. There are also a few Anhui and Cantonese restaurants. The only one that cooks and sells Western-style pastries is "Baoshan." As for fuel, no one uses coal because coal is scarce and expensive. Therefore, they have switched to using charcoal and charcoal briquettes, so eating out in restaurants takes a lot more time. Most of the drinking water is rainwater, and most of the rest is river water, which tastes salty and is difficult to use for making tea.

Living in Ningbo, rent is also very cheap. The difficulty is the fear of air raids. However, since the outbreak of the war, only a limited number of houses have been destroyed by air raids. Only the bustling urban area of Zhongqiao was bombed in April of last year, but it has now been restored. Ordinary houses are mostly false three-story buildings, and there are the most of them along Zhongshan Road, almost every family is like this. In the old-fashioned houses, the paint on the parlors and rooms is very exquisite, with vermilion glossy paint, which is very magnificent. Yong lacquer has long been famous in our country. As for the hotel industry, since the freight and passenger traffic has been prosperous, it has also developed abnormally. Hotels such as Anping Hotel are equipped with water heaters and bathtubs, and the facilities are also very modern, with room rates of more than six yuan per day. As for other lower-level hotels, a double-bed room also costs two yuan, three or four cents a day, because there are so many travelers coming and going, they are often fully booked.

Ningbo's transportation industry was well-developed with highways and railways before the war, but after the war, these novel means of transportation were automatically destroyed. Inland transportation relies only on waterways, so "fast boats" and small steam launches bear the important task of transportation. In some shallow places, the ancient means of transportation, "bamboo rafts," are used to maintain transportation. For foreign trade, although the ships from Shanghai cannot enter the blockade line, the transshipment of civilian ships is also very convenient. Therefore, Ningbo is still an important center for foreign and inland transportation today. As for Ningbo itself, there are many rickshaws and bicycles. The road surface in the bustling urban area is also an asphalt road, but the quieter ones are completely built with crushed stones, which is not convenient for walking.

In short, the cost of living in Ningbo is indeed lower than that of the isolated island, and the local situation is also full of unlimited vigor.

### How to Organize Academic Research Groups - Can Imitate the "Reading Club" Method

— Fo

On the 12th, after reading Mr. Xinliang's article "How We Organize Reading Clubs," I had a thought. This thought was originally ordinary and not a strange or special thought. However, this kind of reading club is still not enough, and it should be gradually and greatly expanded.

According to Mr. Xinliang, the reason for organizing a reading club is due to the high price of books and the extremely weak purchasing power of individuals' economic strength. Therefore, the method of collective book purchase is used to relieve the hunger for knowledge. I agree with this method one hundred and twenty points. However, I hope to organize more of this kind of reading club, the more the better. The group does not need to be too large, as it is difficult to manage. The number of people does not need to be too large, as the members are inevitably complex. Just two or thirty people in a group, up to fifty or sixty people in a group. Assuming fifty or sixty people pay a membership fee of one yuan per month, then fifty or sixty yuan of books can be purchased each month. If each person pays a membership fee of fifty cents per month, then twenty or thirty yuan of reading materials can be purchased, and there will be a lot of books to see.

Recently, there are many dance halls and cinemas in Shanghai, and even gambling houses and opium dens in western Shanghai are everywhere. However, it is as rare as phoenix feathers to find an academic research group. Even if there is one, it only has the meaning of publicity and lacks the spirit of research. In other words, there is only a formal organization without spiritual research. Therefore, this kind of group is not easy to develop. I hope to organize this kind of academic research group, not only limited to purchasing and reading books and newspapers, but also expanding it, such as calligraphy and painting, as well as poetry, songs, or researchers of various sciences, should also, based on their knowledge, organize this kind of academic research group.

After all, learning has no limits. The more you research, the more interesting it becomes. The more you research, the more inventions you make. Therefore, Mr. Ma Xiangbo once said that a college graduate is not that his studies have been completed, but that his studies have just begun. Therefore, a college graduate is like getting a key to a bookshelf, and he can arbitrarily study the books in the bookshelf. Assuming that you get this key, and you think that your studies have been satisfied, it is really a big mistake and a special mistake. This is really a wise saying. I hope that modern young people will always open this key to the bookshelf and put the books in the bookshelf into their stomachs. Do not hang this key on your body as a golden signboard, or as a stepping stone for promotion and wealth.

Or it may be said that there are quite a few organizations that are economical and principled to read pictures, novels, and magazines. For example, the novels and magazines rented out by bookstores, or the books lent out by circulating libraries, are also organized according to economic principles. However, it is difficult to find slightly advanced or specialized books, or to find the books that you want to read in your ideals, especially books on calligraphy and painting, it is even more difficult to rent. It is true that they have books that I don't want to read, and I want to read them, but they don't have this book. There is still no proper and complete book rental agency. Originally, there were several libraries where you could go to see them. However, now there are few such agencies. Therefore, organizing academic research groups is really required by the situation. Ambitious young people, or non-young people, should quickly organize them.

I hope that the people on the isolated island will take the time and money spent on pleasure, or in theaters, dance halls, and gambling halls, and spend them on academic research, turning useless into useful, and turning waste into economy. The difference cannot be measured by distance.

### After the Rain, the Sky is Clear

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter 19: Watching Flowers and Appreciating the Moon, Building a Family; Planting Jade and Conceiving Pearls, Having Skills in Pregnancy

It turned out that Dr. Tang Huizhen was a religious person, so she made this argument. However, Zhu Airen also agreed with this statement, feeling that if this artificial insemination method became popular, it could be said to be a major change in ethics. Moreover, her own Women and Children's Hospital and Baby Home would probably have a direct relationship. This time, the two of them talked about the invention of artificial insemination by European and American scientists, which was also a casual conversation. What was strange was that the conversation was between two unmarried young ladies. Unmarried young ladies studying how to raise sons is truly what the ancient Chinese books said, "There is no one who learns how to raise sons before marrying." But their positions should all study this matter, because one is a female specialist and the other is the director of the Women's Hospital, how can they turn a deaf ear to it? Zhu Airen ate dinner at Tang Huizhen's house, and then returned to the hotel, but saw that the two Miss He had also returned to the hotel. They also went out in the morning. They went to the International Hotel to visit Mr. Jiang, their father's friend, to see if he had come to Shanghai. They asked at the front desk of the International Hotel, and the answer was, "Mr. Jiang will arrive tomorrow. He has already sent a telegram, and the room has been booked." Mr. Jiang was originally a regular customer of the International Hotel, so he knew as soon as he asked. The two Miss He came out of the International Hotel and went to visit several of their fellow villagers and classmates. Among the foreigners, they also knew several textile experts. They are now going to start their own textile factory, and they also want to recruit talents to help them. A textile factory also needs various specialists. That kind of textile factory needs both skilled female workers and skilled technicians. It is of course impossible to recruit those skilled female workers in Freedom Village, so it is necessary to prepare in advance. Fortunately, there are several higher textile schools and textile technical personnel training institutes in Shanghai, which are all cultivating textile talents. Higher textile schools can create technicians, and training institutes can create various textile workers. They thought: In the future, after their textile factory is established, they will also set up a textile personnel training institute near the factory site. Because the textile industry in China is becoming more and more developed, the need for textile personnel will inevitably increase in the future, and there will inevitably be a shortage of talents. Even their own factory will definitely add new technicians and new workers every year. It is estimated that their textile factory will be established in Freedom Village, and it is inevitable that they will recruit many technicians and workers from Shanghai. This can be asserted. I am afraid that it will be urgent at the temporary moment, but it must be prepared now. The two Miss He also know the teachers in these higher textile schools, so they also want to visit them and ask for advice. (227)

### A Reporter's Visit to a Newspaper Vendor

— Zeng Zhen

My lifelong hobby is only books, but books are so expensive that poor kids can only rummage in book stalls or linger in newspaper stands.

After meeting often, I naturally became familiar with the newspaper vendors. The following is a conversation with a certain newspaper vendor. If I can't name it, let's call it an interview.

I didn't originally intend to talk to him. The motive arose after seeing him, because I didn't think he looked like an ordinary newspaper vendor: he was tall and slender, but a little thin. He was wearing a worn-out suit, and his feet were in broken leather shoes that were about to come apart. He had a long face and a very clean appearance. Moreover, when I approached the newspaper stand, he was reading a book, which was "×× Economics."

I took a magazine from the bookshelf and flipped through it randomly for a while. He also glanced at me, so I started a conversation with him.

"Is there a discount on this magazine?"

"Sir, this magazine has to be sold at the real price, because I only get 20% off when I buy it myself." He explained kindly, without any unhappy look, and his words were very frank and straightforward. I continued to ask him:

"Can you reduce the price a little?"

"I can't, because we can't earn much money at the real price."

"How many copies of this magazine can you sell each issue?"

"Within ten copies; there are not many that can sell ten copies."

"Which magazine sells best?"

"Movies and the like!"

"Now that paper is so expensive, the prices of various magazines have almost doubled, and even fewer people are buying them. Therefore, most of the magazines on the shelves now have to be returned." He said with emotion, and with a very worried look.

"Then how much money can you earn every day?" I asked sympathetically.

"It's hard to maintain a living!" He was distressed.

"Then why do you sell newspapers?"

"There's nothing else to do!"

So I talked to him in detail. He told me that he was a student who had received junior high school education, in a county near Shanghai. His father was an official in a customs office, but since the war started, his family was gone, and his parents were nowhere to be found. He was lonely and drifted to the isolated island, living as a newspaper vendor. But he said that as long as there was a chance, he would leave here and would not want to sink his ambition.

In the end, I bought a magazine from him and slowly strolled home.

### Suggestion to Recall Altered Banknotes

— Ding

During a busy business, a colleague of mine received an altered ten-yuan banknote. This banknote was altered from a five-yuan banknote issued by the Central Bank. If the four corners of the banknote were not blurred, it would be impossible to see the flaw. When the colleague took out the banknote to count it and found out, the buyer had long since disappeared. He was very angry and wanted to tear it up, but when he thought of how difficult it was to find money, he couldn't help but shed tears. He resentfully pressed the banknote under the glass plate as a reference for others to guard against. I have also seen altered banknotes several times. It is conceivable that many people must have been deceived, and some people then passed the altered banknotes on to others, which is a lack of morality. In my opinion, these banknotes should be handed over to charitable organizations, and the original face value of the altered banknotes should be recovered. Then, the charitable organizations can gather them together and exchange them at the respective banks. This method is without loss to both parties. Now, I borrow a corner of your newspaper for discussion by people from all walks of life.
