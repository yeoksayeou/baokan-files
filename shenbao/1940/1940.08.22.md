### Several Elite Chinese Army Divisions Deployed on the Yunnan-Vietnam Border; Chairman Chiang and Others Inspect Defense in Yunnan; Chinese Counteroffensive in Longzhou Strives to Prevent Japanese Advance to the West

Hong Kong, Kunming Correspondence: The crisis in Yunnan Province is worsening. The Japanese Hanoi Inspection Group, led by Major General Nishihara, has begun negotiations with French authorities regarding the establishment of naval and air bases in Vietnam. The aim is to attack Yunnan Province and increase Japan's control over Vietnam. These negotiations have been ongoing since last week. However, the Japanese side claims that these negotiations are to discuss increasing trade between Japan and Vietnam. If the Japanese obtain land and air bases in Hanoi and Haiphong, it will greatly facilitate their attack on Yunnan Province. It is widely expected that the Japanese troops in Longzhou, southwestern Guangxi, will launch a large-scale invasion of Yunnan to assist the offensive from Vietnam. Several divisions of elite Chinese troops have been deployed on the Yunnan-Vietnam border. It is reported that General Chiang Kai-shek and Generals Bai Chongxi and Yang Jie visited Yunnan last weekend to inspect the defense of Yunnan and conferred with Long Yun, Chairman of Yunnan Province and military leader of the province. If the Vietnamese authorities yield to Japan, the Chinese troops stationed on the Yunnan-Vietnam border will take offensive action when necessary. An unconfirmed report states that several Chinese soldiers crossed the border into Vietnam earlier this month, escorting cargo trucks and a large amount of gasoline in front of Japanese inspectors. These Chinese soldiers were extremely well-trained and well-equipped. As a result, Lieutenant General Catroux was removed from his post as Governor-General of Indochina and replaced by Vice Admiral Decoux, commander of the French Far East Fleet. It is reported that the French fleet has left Haiphong to avoid being encircled by the Japanese navy, as the Japanese naval power in Tokyo Bay far exceeds that of the French. Currently, the Chinese army is launching a major counteroffensive in the southern, northeastern, and central parts of Longzhou to prevent the Japanese army from moving west from Longzhou to invade Yunnan. (21st International News Agency)

Chongqing: The Central Daily News recently reported that Vietnamese Governor-General Decoux has rejected all demands made by the Japanese side and has put forward a counter-proposal, demanding that future Japanese inspectors not be allowed to land and enter Vietnam, and that the two Japanese warships anchored offshore should leave immediately. The Kuomin Kung Pao, under the large-character headline "Thailand and Vietnam Jointly Resist Japan," declared that a Thai military delegation, led by senior military leaders, will arrive in Hanoi to discuss joint defense between the two countries with the Vietnamese Governor to resist the Japanese advance southward. In describing the Vietnamese Governor's rejection of the four demands made by the Japanese side, the newspaper also stated that France has concentrated more than thirty warships in Vietnamese waters, which have come from Madagascar. The newspaper also claimed that Japan has concentrated nearly thirty warships in Tokyo Bay and sixty warships along the coast of Hainan Island. The newspaper also stated that Japanese warships have repeatedly violated French waters within Guangzhou Bay. It also stated that on August 10, the French authorities in Guangzhou Bay disarmed many Chinese police officers. According to well-informed sources, at a time when France and Japan are about to clash over Vietnam, Thailand's true attitude is an important issue concerning the Far Eastern political situation. It is understood that the news they have obtained from various parts of Southeast Asia regarding Thailand's attitude is quite different. The Thai government seems to be wavering at the crossroads of two paths. The first path is to join hands with Japan and take the opportunity to send troops to recover eastern Cambodia, which it considers lost territory, when Japan invades Annam and Tokyo. The second path is to unite with France to jointly resist Japan's invasion of the Indochina Peninsula. The Thai military delegation may submit its recommendations to Bangkok for a decision. (21st United Press)

London: Reliable sources recently stated that the US government recently notified the Japanese government that Britain is very concerned about the current situation in Vietnam. The source also said that Washington has sent a similar policy statement to Tokyo. It is reported that these Anglo-American notes were sent to the Japanese government after news of Japan's request to use Vietnam as a base was released. (21st Dispatch)

Editorial

### The Far East and Europe

Whether the center of the world today is Europe or the East is naturally not a question that can be decided in a few words. From an economic and commercial point of view alone, Europe held supreme authority until the eve of this great war, and therefore did not lose its leading position. However, when it comes to the political destiny of the world, the view that Europe dominates the world, which prevailed half a century or even a century ago, has clearly become outdated. At the very least, the many changes taking place internationally are no longer determined solely by forces in Europe. The Versailles Conference, which resolved the post-World War I situation, only produced some clumsy and impractical proposals for the Far East. The events in the Far East that began in September 1931 formed the initial trigger for this European war. Contemporary politicians who control the world's destiny should draw new insights from these experiences. If they continue to cling to the flamboyant views of the previous century, viewing Europe as the center of the international community and forcing the situation outside of Europe to be subordinate to their interests in Europe, this incorrect understanding will inevitably lead them to produce a large number of political crimes.

War is currently underway in Europe, with both belligerents mobilizing all their forces to achieve victory. Recently, fierce battles have reached a brutal level in the North Sea and the Red Sea, but the final outcome does not seem to be determined in the short term. In all the warring countries, they should not only confine their eyes to a corner of the European continent, and arbitrarily dispose of all events outside Europe as insignificant branches. If that is the case, even if they achieve success in the war in Europe, they will inevitably suffer a tragic failure outside of Europe. The recent rapid tightening of the situation in the South China Sea and the South Pacific should be a powerful warning to the European belligerents. It must be understood that today's war is not only being waged in Europe. The European war certainly attracts worldwide attention, but the war in the Far East also affects the entire international situation. The European war is only a re-enactment of some historical tragedies, while the struggle in the East is pregnant with the struggle for freedom, independence, and a just order. Therefore, the Far Eastern issue should at least be an independent category, and it must not be forced to change with the interests of Europe. If some politicians nine years ago made an irreparable mistake due to a mistaken understanding of the Far Eastern aggression, then the consequences will be even more unimaginable if the countries currently at war repeat the same mistakes.

The recent failure of some British officials and people to promote the opening of the Yunnan-Burma Road proves that although the British government has been thoroughly taught a lesson by showing weakness and making concessions, it is still lingering in the erroneous segments of its history and has not yet made the determination and courage to change its course. The blockade of the Burma Road has been going on for a month. China has certainly been severely restricted, but what has Britain gained? As a result, Japan's arrogance has become even more arrogant, and its threats to Britain have become even greater. The three-month deadline will be reached in an instant. At that time, the European war may not be able to have a decisive future. Will Britain continue to make unwise and unjust surrenders, or will it resolutely change its course and make up for its mistakes? There are currently no signs to be found. However, the British authorities should see clearly that the Far Eastern issue and the European war are two completely different things. The safety of the Far Eastern situation depends on the future of the Sino-Japanese War, and it must not rely on Japan's "goodwill". Even in Germany and Italy, they should see clearly that the assistance that Japan can provide is limited, and the obstacles to the future development of Germany and Italy are endless. Germany and Italy should know that Japan is determined to share weal and woe with Germany and Italy. Even if the opposing situation in Europe is expanded to the Far East, the beneficiaries will not be Germany and Italy.

Recognizing Europe as the center of the world only occurred after the unprecedented development of modern colonial undertakings. Even in the past, Europe was deeply troubled by the Tartars and Turks, so that the European continent could not protect itself. Today, the European countries have encountered threats from the East for the third time, and even if they are at war themselves, they should not underestimate this point. This phenomenon is actually only based on the endless expansionist desires of the Eastern aggressors, and there is absolutely no preference for or aversion to the various opposing countries. There is no shortage of people in the West who claim to be familiar with the affairs of the East. They should seek a thorough understanding and correct strategy for the current situation in the Far East. If they are blinded by prejudice again and imagine that they can improve their position in the European war by condoning the spread of the Far Eastern wildfire, they will not only fail to obtain the immediate benefits they seek, but will only encourage the advancement of the delusion of conquering the world.

### British Prime Minister Formally Announces Lease of Western Hemisphere Territories to US for Defense; Term Set at Ninety-Nine Years; Details to be Discussed Soon

London: British Prime Minister Churchill, in a long speech in the House of Commons last night on the current war situation, made the most important announcement: "A few months ago, we realized that for the benefit of both Britain and the United States, the United States should have naval and air bases in the Western Hemisphere to prevent Nazi countries from acquiring temporary or long-term control over most of Western Europe's land and resources. Therefore, we decided to notify the US government that we would be willing to grant the United States this kind of defense convenience and lease appropriate areas in Britain's Atlantic territories to the United States to consolidate its security and prevent future dangers. We have taken this action voluntarily, neither at the request of others nor with any expectations. The principle of the union of interests between Britain and the United States to respond to common purposes has been demonstrated in several agreements before the war, such as the matter of several small islands in the Pacific Ocean now becoming important refueling points. We are in complete agreement with the Canadian government on this matter. We now know that the United States is also concerned about the air and naval defenses of the Atlantic coast, and President Roosevelt has recently stated that he is willing to discuss with us, Canada, and Newfoundland the problem of the United States developing its naval and air force facilities in Newfoundland and the West Indies. Of course, there is no question of transferring sovereignty in this matter, nor is it contrary to the wishes of the relevant colonies. The British government is willing to provide the United States with defense conveniences by means of a ninety-nine-year lease. We are certain that our interests and the interests of the United States, as well as the interests of Canada and Newfoundland, will all benefit from this. Undoubtedly, this approach will unite the two major democratic countries of Britain and the United States in some of their affairs and seek mutual common welfare. This trend will continue to flow like the Mississippi River, and nothing can stop it." (21st Reuters)

London: Foreign Secretary Halifax, in replying to questions during debate in the House of Lords as to whether British discussion with America would affect bases outside the Atlantic, such as Singapore, said: "Anglo-American negotiations, confined to the Atlantic, West Indies and Newfoundland, have now been agreed upon in principle, but have not yet begun to discuss details. However, he was gratified that no great difficulties would arise in the discussion of details." (21st Reuters)

New York: President Roosevelt told reporters at Hyde Park, New York yesterday that US talks with Britain on obtaining naval and air bases were proceeding satisfactorily, but that he was unwilling to predict when concrete developments could be expected. Asked if he had reached agreement with Canadian Prime Minister King on the establishment of a US-Canada joint defense council, with the possibility of using US destroyers, the President replied that this was merely a press report. (21st Reuters)

US to Send Eleven-Member Committee to Participate in US-Canada Joint Defense Group

Hyde Park: President Roosevelt said yesterday that he would announce the dispatch of an eleven-member committee on Thursday to participate in the formation of a permanent US-Canada joint defense. (21st United Press)

Ottawa: It is heard that Canadian Prime Minister King will convene a special parliament in mid-September to pass the US-Canada joint defense bill. (21st United Press)

Ottawa: Canadian Prime Minister King stated yesterday at a press reception that the mission of the Canadian-American Defense Committee was largely to study mutual defense and provide consultation. The committee will contribute new ideas on national defense to both governments. This does not mean that Canada is avoiding its responsibilities, but that Canada will assume its share of mutual obligations. (21st Reuters)

Washington: Those opposed to intervention in the European war are increasingly worried about the relationship between the United States and Canada, which is already a de facto alliance. They say that the Senate, which is responsible for US foreign affairs, has not yet commented on the dramatic changes in foreign policy. In addition to military affairs, economic affairs are now also showing signs of preparation for intervention. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau's trip to Canada is said to be related to loans. He may fly to Britain to discuss lending aid to Britain with Churchill. As for the US dispatch of warships, it is not very important. The New York Sun's Washington correspondent said that the Senate's current problem is whether Britain will soon join the US in resisting Germany with its naval and air forces. US neutrality has become empty talk. Sending warships to aid Britain and compulsory military service are only a small part of the problems that Roosevelt wants to solve before the presidential election. (21st Haitong Agency)

US Has Entered Emergency Period; Members of Congress Approve Sale of Warships

Washington: Members of Congress yesterday continued to support the statement that the executive leader has completed a plan to transfer fifty US destroyers to Britain through Canada as an intermediary. However, the Navy Department refused to comment on the matter. According to reports, once the US-Canada defense treaty is formally signed, Canada will be supplied with several destroyers by the United States. A Navy Department spokesman said, "We have no official documents to release regarding the sale of destroyers to foreign governments," but he said that the Navy Department will express its views on the matter to President Roosevelt. (21st United Press)

Washington: Senator Wheeler yesterday gave a national broadcast, opposing the US sale of destroyers to Britain, and said that America's first line of defense is its own navy and the ocean between the US, Europe, and Asia, not the British navy. In principle, there is no such thing as "non-war-like" aid. The current priority is to maintain America's way of life. We must recognize that war destroys our democracy." He also said, "The last European war has proved that democracy cannot be saved on the European battlefield." He advised the people to be careful of sweet words and to remember the facts that accompany war, namely death, destruction, and poverty. (21st United Press)

Washington: US Ambassador to France Bullitt gave a speech in Philadelphia a few days ago, and Undersecretary of State Welles responded yesterday, announcing that the State Department fully endorses this speech, that the United States has entered an emergency period, and that it must have people like Bullitt who have witnessed the actual situation report truthfully. (21st Haitong Agency)

Former British Secretary of War Belisha Says European War Promotes Anglo-American Union

London: Former Secretary of War Belisha claimed that the result of the European war may lead to an Anglo-American union. In discussing Churchill's speech, he said that the mixing of British and American interests is now inevitable. Everything the Prime Minister said about US relations is enough to compensate for a diplomatic mission. If this trend can unite the British and American people, it is enough to compensate for the scourge of the European war. (21st United Press)

### US Representative to the Vatican to Return Home Soon to Discuss Work with President

Vatican City: According to those close to Myron Taylor yesterday, President Roosevelt's representative to the Vatican, Myron Taylor, will return to the United States soon to consult with the President on his work here. They said that Taylor was unwilling to discuss his future plans, so it was impossible to know whether he would return to Rome after meeting with the President or remain in the United States. They also emphasized the importance of Taylor's talk with the Pope yesterday, pointing out that the meeting lasted one hour and fifteen minutes, and that he and the Pope had a thorough discussion on the general situation in Europe.

### Panama's Defense Should Be Improved; US Congressman Thomas Writes to Secretary of War Stimson

Washington: New Jersey Republican Congressman Thomas recently wrote to Secretary of War Stimson, saying that the defenses of the Panama Canal Zone and Puerto Rico are completely inadequate and should be improved. He said that the defenses of these two places have not been improved in the slightest in thirty years. Thomas advocated increasing anti-aircraft guns, ammunition depots, hand-held machine guns, aircraft, tanks, etc. in these two places, and believed that Panama's oil storage and ammunition depots should be built underground. He also believed that Puerto Rico's air force was too weak, with only twelve aircraft. However, he praised the morale of the troops stationed in Panama and Puerto Rico. (21st United Press)

### British Blockade of Yunnan-Burma Transport; Questions Raised in the House of Commons

London: During a meeting of the House of Commons today, a question was raised asking whether, in view of the closure of the Burma Road, which prevents the transport of military supplies to China, the government would propose to cancel the 1 million barrels of oil produced by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, which is controlled by the British government, that were sold to Japan in April 1940. Undersecretary of State Butler replied that he could not add anything to the reply made by the Minister of Petroleum on April 23. Liberal Party MP Mander rose to speak, saying, "On the one hand, oil is supplied to Japan to attack China, while at the same time China is not allowed to obtain this supply from the Burma Road. Can there be anything more unfair than this?" Butler replied that, as the Minister of Petroleum announced on April 23, the British government had stated that its policy was not to interfere in the company's commercial activities. According to the Minister of Petroleum's reply to a question on April 23 of this year, the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company supplies Japan with a large amount of oil on a purely commercial basis. Although the government holds a large share in the company, it has declared its policy of non-interference in the company's commercial activities. (21st Reuters)

### Japan to Withdraw Nationals in Britain; Negotiations with Germany to be Held on Safety of Japanese Ships

Tokyo: According to semi-official sources, in order to guarantee the safety of 800 Japanese nationals returning to Japan from Britain, the Japanese government will soon negotiate with Germany on the safety of the Japanese ships "Hakone Maru", "Fushimi Maru" and "Hakozaki Maru". The "Suwa Maru" arrived in Liverpool the day before yesterday, carrying 40 Japanese nationals. The remaining three ships will also arrive in Liverpool soon. (21st Haitong Agency)

London: The Japanese Embassy here has not attempted to organize any organized withdrawal of Japanese nationals in Britain. A spokesman for the Japanese Embassy said that only a small batch of 40 Japanese nationals, who wished to return home for business reasons, were currently being given passage facilities and had already booked their berths. (21st Reuters)

### Example of Japanese Aggression: Includes the Dutch East Indies and Vietnam; Cabinet Accepts Koiso's Proposal; Matsuoka Reports on Diplomacy to the Emperor

Tokyo - Yesterday, the Emperor, at his summer palace in Hayama, received Foreign Minister Matsuoka to hear a report on diplomatic issues. Prior to his audience with the Emperor, the Foreign Minister held meetings with Prime Minister Konoe, Minister of Commerce and Industry Kobayashi, army representatives, and General Koiso, who is about to go to the Dutch East Indies. According to semi-official sources, within the scope of current East Asian economic policy, a decision has been made regarding the approach to the "Southern Advance." Political figures here state that Japan's "Southern Advance Policy" specifies the inclusion of the Dutch East Indies and Vietnam within the East Asian economic sphere. General Koiso's "Southern Advance Policy" has been accepted by the Cabinet, and he will begin to implement this policy. (Haitong News Agency, 21st)

### Japan Again Pays Attention to the Pacific Status Quo: Does Not Oppose American Patrol of Canadian Waters

Tokyo - Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma stated today that the Foreign Ministry has received reports regarding the Shanghai International Settlement defense area, confirming the details reported in the newspapers. However, the assertion that U.S. Ambassador to Japan Grew visited the Japanese Foreign Ministry regarding this matter is untrue. He has heard rumors of the transfer of British islands in the Pacific to other countries. If this is the case, then he cannot remain silent. The United States previously issued a statement maintaining the status quo in the Pacific, but now it seems to have changed its opinion. Since Canada and the United States are adjacent, Japan does not oppose the United States patrolling Canadian territorial waters. (Reuters, 21st)

### Britain Strives to Improve Relations with the Soviet Union: New Trade Agreement Soon to be Concluded

London - Dominions Secretary Attlee, speaking in the House of Lords yesterday and delivering a statement largely similar to that made by the Prime Minister, stated that improving Anglo-Soviet relations is a matter of concern to the British government. Soviet interests intersect with the British Empire on many points. Caution in all matters will facilitate a better understanding. He believes that the basis for a satisfactory trade agreement with the Soviet Union already exists. British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Cripps has met with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and has successfully executed his difficult mission. Cripps is keenly aware of the importance of these negotiations for trade, and as a result, an Anglo-Soviet trade agreement is expected to be concluded soon. (Reuters, 21st)

### Bloodshed in Mexico City: Trotsky Assassinated; Seriously Wounded in the Head and Life Endangered; One Assailant Arrested

Mexico City - The exiled Soviet revolutionary Trotsky was assassinated yesterday at his residence here, suffering serious head injuries. It is reported that the assailant was a frequent visitor and appeared to be a member of the family. According to doctors, Trotsky's life may not last until dawn. (Associated Press, 21st)

Mexico City - Former Soviet Communist leader and founder of the Red Army, Trotsky, was violently attacked in his study yesterday by a friend with an axe, suffering severe wounds to the head, shoulders, and knees. He is currently in critical condition in an oxygen tent at the Green Cross Emergency Hospital. Although doctors have administered stimulants, his breathing remains very weak. Doctors are making every effort to save him. The man who wounded Trotsky is 36 years old, named Teriou, and is a reporter for a Paris newspaper, fluent in English and French. He has been arrested at the police station. According to the guards at Trotsky's villa, speaking to an Associated Press reporter, Trotsky was attacked at 4:20 PM yesterday. They believe Teriou must have directly entered Trotsky's room to commit the act. At the time of the incident, guards outside the door heard Trotsky's cries and immediately rushed into the room, apprehending the assassin. Trotsky's wife, hearing her husband's cries, ran into the room, caught sight of Trotsky's terrible condition, cried out in shock, and has been by his side ever since, attending to him. After Trotsky entered the hospital, he was lucid once before surgery and able to speak to the police, as the police approached Trotsky to obtain his verbal report. The surgery went well, but afterwards he fell into a coma. A nurse at the hospital said that Trotsky may not survive. Trotsky's secretary has sent telegrams to New York and Long Island, urgently requesting famous doctors to try and save him. (Associated Press, 21st)

Mexico City - The exiled Soviet leader Trotsky recently invited a French Jew named Johnson for tea. For some unknown reason, the man struck him with a hammer, causing a severe fracture of Trotsky's skull. He is now in the emergency hospital in critical condition. The assailant was struck unconscious by Trotsky's guards at the time of the attack and is now detained at the local police headquarters. Trotsky's residence is guarded by police, strictly prohibiting others from entering. In May of this year, twenty people attacked Trotsky's bedroom with machine guns, attempting to kill him, but were unsuccessful. (Reuters, 21st)

San Francisco - The founder of the Mexican Communist Party, Trotskyist leader Rivera, recently stated that Stalin should be held responsible for the attack on Trotsky, and believes Stalin was instructed by Hitler. (Associated Press, 21st)

### British Government, for Freedom and Justice, Resolves to Fight to the End; Churchill Reports on the War Situation in the House of Commons; Believes the War's Prospects are Gradually Becoming Favorable to Britain

London - Prime Minister Churchill reported on the current war situation in the House of Commons last night. In his address, he: (1) Declared Britain's intention to maintain and implement a strict blockade not only against Germany but also against Italy, France, and other occupied countries; (2) Urged the nation to prepare for the wars of 1941 and 1942 in a determined and systematic manner; (3) Expressed the British government's unwavering determination to continue fighting to achieve victory; (4) Praised the loyalty and bravery of British pilots and the excellence of British aircraft; (5) Reported that the British Navy is stronger than at the beginning of the war, but expressed the hope that overseas friends could provide timely assistance to Britain to fill the gap between the fleet in peacetime 1939 and the fleet in wartime 1941; (6) Expressed gratitude for the United States' supply of large quantities of guns and ammunition of various kinds; (7) Announced that the production of new British aircraft has now caught up with Germany, and that American aircraft are gradually arriving in Britain. Mr. Churchill spoke for 68 minutes. Upon finishing his speech and taking his seat, the entire House cheered.

The Prime Minister told the House of Commons that Britain has lost nearly 92,000 people since the start of the war, including those killed, seriously wounded, captured, and missing. In contrast, the losses in the first twelve months of the last Great War reached 365,000. We must actively prepare for war in the next two or three years. Although human life is short, two or three years is not a long time. Two or three years is insignificant in the history of a nation. We are currently doing the most honorable thing in the world, being the sole guarantor of freedom for all of Europe. Therefore, during these two or three years of hardship, we must not complain. Our efforts in the future are not limited to self-defense. Where there is a will, there is a way. We must prepare everything and not miss any opportunities. The way to quickly end the war is not in empty words, but in showing the enemy that we have the will and ability not only to fight for a long time, but also to inflict heavy blows on the enemy. The path to final victory may not be as distant as we expect. This is something we cannot predict. No matter how long or short the road is, or how dangerous or easy it is, we must reach its end. (Loud cheers)

Strictly Enforce Blockade of the European Continent to Prevent Civilian Food from Aiding the Enemy

We want to maintain and implement a strict blockade, not only against Germany but also against Italy, France, and other occupied countries. I learned from the press that Hitler has also announced a blockade against Britain. Let us listen to this statement with a grain of salt. I recall that the German Emperor also did this during the last Great War. (Laughter from the audience) If we allow food to be transported in an endless stream to supply the Germans and help their war effort, or if we allow food to be supplied to the ravaged people and ultimately seized by the occupiers, then we would be prolonging the suffering of all of Europe and becoming the target of general condemnation. There are currently many proposals based on the noblest of motives that food should be allowed to pass through the blockade to save disaster victims. I regret to state that we must reject such requests. (Loud cheers) The Nazi Party claims that they have created a new and unified economy in Europe and have repeatedly stated that they have sufficient stocks to feed the people of the occupied territories. On June 27th, German radio stated that Hoover's plan to supply Belgium, France, and the Netherlands was admirable, but the German people have already taken the necessary steps. As far as we know, Norway had enough food to last a year when the German army invaded. Although Poland is not a wealthy country, it produces enough food for its own consumption. The other countries invaded by Hitler also had ample food reserves and produced their own food at the time of the German invasion. If all civilian food is now gone, it must have been moved to feed the German people. The harvest has just been completed, so there should be no risk of famine at this time or in the coming months. The only thing that can cause famine anywhere in Europe today and this winter is German extraction or German failure to distribute all the food they possess. Furthermore, one point worth noting is that the most valuable food is often necessary for the manufacture of important war materials. Oils are used to make explosives, sweet potatoes are used to make alcohol, and the civilian-type raw materials currently used in aircraft manufacturing are made from milk. If the Germans use these foods to help them bomb our women and children, rather than to feed the good people who produce these foods, then the imported food will also be used directly or indirectly for this purpose, or to reduce the enemy's responsibility for doing so. We want to hold Hitler fully responsible and help the people of Europe groaning under Hitler's yoke in every way possible to hasten the arrival of their liberation. We can arrange in advance to quickly import food for civilian use where the German army has been cleared and freedom has been restored. We should do our best to encourage the storage of food everywhere in the world. Europeans, including Germans and Austrians, should know that the destruction of Nazi power will immediately restore food freedom and peace. (Loud cheers)

Britain is Determined to Fight Alone; Righteousness Will Ultimately Prevail

The new British government has been in power for only three months, and misfortunes have come one after another. The Netherlands could not resist. Its beloved monarch suffered abroad, and Rotterdam, known for its peace, became a scene of cruel massacres like those in the Thirty Years' War. Belgium was invaded, and the expeditionary force sent by King Leopold was cut off from its return route, almost captured, and barely escaped, losing all its equipment. Soon after, France withdrew from the battlefield, and Italy became our enemy. The entire territory of France fell into enemy hands, and its arsenals and large quantities of military supplies were transferred to enemy use. The Vichy puppet government was established and could become our enemy at any time. The entire west coast of Europe, from the North Cape to the Spanish border, is within Germany's sphere of influence, and all its ports and airfields can be used as launching points for an invasion of Britain. The German air force, in terms of numbers, surpasses Britain's and has approached the British Isles. Thus, what we feared in the past has now become a reality. Enemy bombers can not only reach the British coast from many directions in a matter of minutes, but also gain the cover of their fighter planes. If we had faced this situation in early May, it would have seemed impossible that we would be the darlings of heaven after the war, or that we would still be standing tall today with confidence in final victory. Even the world did not believe that we could still survive. Today, we are stronger than we were in the past. (Loud cheers) Although Britain is fighting alone now, it has nothing to fear and will not retreat. Even those who previously longed for peace are now dedicated to the war, because we are more united than ever before. Death is a small matter; the shame of failure and the disgrace of neglecting one's duty are great matters. How the future will unfold cannot be predicted. The hardships ahead may be even greater than they are now, but no matter what, we must deal with them. We are certain that righteousness will prevail.

Military Strength Greatly Enhanced; Resources Inexhaustible

We have not only strengthened our resolve, but also fortified our islands. We have reorganized the army to an extent that was impossible just months ago. With the support of overseas friends, we have transported various weapons across the Atlantic and landed them safely, without losing a single cannon or bullet. Our factories are working actively as never before, with greatly increased production. The entire British army is stationed in the country, with over two million soldiers armed, ready at any moment, three-quarters of whom are in regular units. This is the first time in wartime that Britain has had such a large army on the British Isles. The whole country awaits the arrival of invaders from the sea or air. I told the House of Commons in mid-June that the stronger the land army in the country, the thicker the enemy's invading forces must be, and the less difficult it will be for our navy to destroy the enemy forces when they invade. Even if the enemy lands and our navy continues to attack their lines of communication, the difficulty of supplying the troops will be even greater. Today, as in Nelson's time, the first line of defense is the enemy's ports. Aerial reconnaissance and photography have provided new assistance. Our navy is also stronger than it was at the beginning of the war. Warships that began construction at the beginning of the war are now gradually being completed. We hope that overseas friends will provide timely assistance to make up for the inadequacy between the fleet in peacetime 1939 and the fleet in wartime 1941. The ocean is open. Enemy submarines have not disappeared, and magnetic mines have not been cleared, but the tonnage of merchant ships under the British flag is now greater than before, after a year of unrestricted submarine warfare and eight months of severe mine attacks. (Loud cheers) In addition, we have four million tonnes of merchant ships that have fled to British ports from invaded countries. We have more food reserves of various kinds than in peacetime, and we are undertaking a great program to increase food production.

I make these statements not to boast. The current crisis is still great, but our strengths and resources are more than sufficient to cope. The reason I describe them is so that the nation should know the solid reasons on which our beliefs are based, and the good reasons why we feel that even if we fight alone, even for many years, we can still continue to fight. Because Britain's continued resistance and Germany's continued resistance will rekindle the fire of hope in the hearts of hundreds of millions of people in Europe who have been ravaged, and from this spark, a huge flame will grow to engulf Nazism.

British Air Force is Superior; Blitz Becomes a Dream

The war in the skies over the British Isles has reached a high point in the past few weeks. The size and duration of its scope cannot be predicted at this time, but we must expect the enemy to make even greater attempts than before. The enemy is still setting up airfields in France and the Netherlands, and the transport of troops and weapons for the invasion of Britain is also underway. What is very obvious is that Hitler cannot admit failure in the air war against Britain until he has suffered extremely serious damage. Hitler has boasted so much about how the German side is winning in the air war, how the British side is losing, and how the British are cowering in air-raid shelters and scolding their aristocratic government for mismanaging the country and harming the people. If he does not carry out his air offensive, will his lies not become even more obvious? (Laughter from the audience) Therefore, we can be sure that Hitler will continue to attack as long as he has this ability. As far as the situation in the air war is concerned, the advantage belongs to the British side. I stated in the House of Commons two months ago that in France, British fighter planes often inflicted losses on German planes at a rate of three to one. During the Dunkirk operation, British planes again achieved victories at a rate of one to three or four. Therefore, we expected an even higher ratio in the air war over the British Isles, and that is indeed the case. (Loud cheers) Enemy planes and pilots shot down over the British Isles or in the seas near Britain are either destroyed or captured, while among the British planes and pilots that crash, many have unharmed fuselages and uninjured crew members who can soon rejoin the war.

The Decisive Factor in the War is the Supremacy in the Sky

The measures taken by the Aircraft Production Department to repair damaged aircraft are great and amazing. They can get damaged aircraft back into battle in no time, and quickly supply all kinds of parts and aircraft materials. At the same time, the great increase in the production of British aircraft and engines has led to a daily increase in the number of various aircraft, and the quality has also been improved. Enemy aircraft certainly outnumber British aircraft, but new British production now exceeds German production, and the aircraft produced by the United States are now gradually being shipped to Britain. The strength of British bombers and fighter planes is stronger than at any time. This is a fact that can be seen from daily statistics. We hope and believe that we can continue to engage in air warfare with the enemy for a long time. The longer we continue, the faster our air force can achieve the goal of first being equal to the enemy in number and then gaining supremacy in the sky. The outcome of the war largely depends on whether or not there is supremacy in the sky. British fighter planes have done a commendable job in defeating the enemy, but the work of British bomber squadrons bombing enemy territory night after night should not be forgotten. We can prove the results of British planes bombing military targets in Germany not only from reports from all sides, but also from the photographs taken. The bombing of German military industry, transportation, air bases, and military supply depots will continue on an ever-increasing scale, and may reach a level never dreamed of before within a year. This method will not stop until the end of the war. This is the longest but the surest way to achieve victory.

Discussing the Situation in the Middle East; Unwilling to Predict Trends

What good would it do for the Nazi army to gain victory near the Black Sea or to penetrate deep into the Caspian Sea, or to press directly on the gates of India, if the entire economic and scientific structure of the German war machine were to be broken and shattered at home? The longer we have been able to preserve our army at Dunkirk, the more difficult it will be for the enemy to launch a large-scale invasion of Britain. We have therefore been able to use our maritime supremacy to focus on the Mediterranean and to deal with another enemy who, after stabbing France in the back at a time of hardship, is now our enemy in Africa. France's defection has, of course, greatly damaged Britain's position in the Middle East. Take, for example, the defense of Somaliland. We relied on French troops to attack the Italian army from Djibouti, and also relied on France's naval and air bases in the Mediterranean and on the coast of North Africa. The French navy was also what we relied upon. Even if France proper is temporarily destroyed, there is no reason why the French navy and most of its army and overseas colonies should not fight alongside us. France, with its powerful navy, strategic bases, and ample funds, could still be a major combatant in the struggle. If we were in their shoes, we would fight to the end, and we would, to the best of our ability, arrange for the maritime safety of Canada and other dominions, so that they would have the means to carry on the struggle from overseas. Most of the countries that have been ravaged by Germany are steadfast and unyielding. The people of the Czech Republic, Poland, Norway, the Netherlands, and Belgium are still armed and engaged in battle, and the United States and Britain both recognize these fighters as the representative authorities and legitimate governments of their countries. France alone has prostrated itself at this time. This is not the fault of the great and noble French nation, but the fault of a minority in Vichy. We have deep sympathy for the French people. (Loud cheers) The old comradeship between Britain and France has not died. General de Gaulle and his comrades are now demonstrating the Anglo-French relationship in an effective form. These free Frenchmen have been sentenced to death, but their names will eventually be commemorated on stone in the towns and streets of a free and restored France. This is something that will happen in the future, as sure as the rising of the morning sun. However, my belief in the future does not affect the difficulties we are currently facing in the Mediterranean and Africa. British troops have recently withdrawn from Somaliland. There will be even greater battles in the Middle East theater. I am unwilling to predict the trends. We still have many troops in the Middle East, and there are many ways to reinforce them. We have complete naval supremacy in the Eastern Mediterranean. We must do our best to demonstrate, in a loyal and resolute manner, the duties and responsibilities that are incumbent upon us in the world.

Will Not Lay Down Arms Until the Goals of the War are Achieved

Aside from this, I think the House of Commons does not want me to say anything more, or to ask for a detailed explanation of Britain's war aims, and the kind of post-war peace that Britain desires. I think that the war is still in its early stages, and it would not be wise to make any pronouncements on this matter at a time when the war is raging. However, one aspect that we can see more clearly is that we must think not only for ourselves, but also for our eternal security, and for the principles for which we are fighting, and for the long-term future of the British Commonwealth of Nations.

### Italy Announces Blockade of British Colonial Coasts; Includes the Mediterranean, Red Sea, and Gulf of Aden; Warns Neutral Vessels Not to Enter Dangerous Zones

Rome - An Italian official spokesman said yesterday that after the occupation of Berbera and British Somaliland by Italian troops, they have been able to threaten Britain's Red Sea entrance. At the same time, it was learned that Italy has ordered a blockade of the entire British Empire and Egypt, and has informed all neutral countries that any ships entering the prohibited area "will be immediately destroyed." The message also reiterated the warning of June 15, stating, "The British mainland and its various colonies, dependencies, mandated territories, and areas where British troops are concentrated, such as Egypt, are all dangerous zones within 30 miles of the coast, and navigation along the African coast, the Red Sea, and the Gulf of Aden is particularly dangerous." Italian officials also said, "After Berbera was occupied by our troops, British Somaliland has almost entirely fallen into our hands." Officials hinted that before taking action to attack and close the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait, Italy wanted to first seize all important British bases in Northeast Africa, and this victory is the first step in this action. The Bab-el-Mandeb Strait connects the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean and is a shortcut from Europe to India, Australia, and New Zealand. (International News Agency, 21st)

Rome - Italy has recently followed Germany's lead and announced a tightening of the blockade of British territories, and has notified neutral governments, warning neutral vessels not to enter Italian war zones. The war zone is quite extensive, including the coastal areas of the British territories and protectorates in the Mediterranean, Red Sea, and Gulf of Aden, and the coasts of the British colonies, Egypt, and Sudan in Africa.

### Italy Occupies British Somaliland: Military Strategic Importance; One of the Pillars of the Suez Canal Has Been Broken; British-Indian Sea Lane of Communication Blocked

Rome: Berbera, the capital of British Somaliland, has now been occupied by Italian forces. Berbera is a natural harbor with a depth of 30 to 60 feet, especially suitable for trade between the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea. Several important highways extend from Berbera into the interior. The city is a center for the trade of colonial products, especially large quantities of ostrich feathers, rubber, hides, and ivory. The annual trade with Aden amounts to 50 million Italian lire. (August 21, Hai Tong Dispatch)

Rome: Local newspapers believe that the occupation of Berbera marks the end of the British Somaliland campaign. Only police action is needed to clear out the remaining British troops. A well-known reporter, Gaida, published an article in the "Italian Daily," stating that British Somaliland has become part of the Italian Empire. The British Navy was only responsible for evacuating troops and military supplies and did not defend Berbera with heavy artillery. One of the pillars of the Suez Canal has been broken. The other pillar, the port of Aden, is only 360 kilometers from the coast of Somaliland and will also be subject to attacks by the Italian air force. (August 21, Hai Tong Dispatch)

Vichy: The French radio station announced that the British withdrawal from British Somaliland is a major victory for Italy. Italy has controlled the Gulf of Aden, which is equivalent to controlling the Gibraltar of the Red Sea. The British communication line with India has been cut off for centuries. (August 21, Hai Tong Dispatch)

Rome: After the Italian forces occupied British Somaliland, the East African defense line decreased from 4,000 kilometers to 1,100 kilometers. Five British air force bases have fallen into Italian hands. Italy began preparing to attack British Somaliland after joining the war on June 10. On the 15th of this month, the Italian air force began attacking British air force bases, bombing Port Sudan six times, Aden eight times, Moyale twice, Djibouti twice, Bobeira six times, Berbera five times, Zeila twice, and Akobo and Wajir several times. Italian forces occupied Gallabat and Kassala on July 4, Kojak and Jessa near Moyale on July 17, and Kojak on July 31. On the 5th of this month, they began attacking British Somaliland. The war zone is between 50 and 60 square kilometers. The Italian forces attacked in three directions: the first towards Zeila, occupying it on the 8th; the second towards Hargeisa, occupying it on the 9th; and the third occupying Usna on the 10th. After the Italian forces occupied the Kaling and Godetala passes between Hargeisa and Berbera, they advanced to the first line of British defense. The Italian forces occupied Adenle on the 12th, and the first line of defense was breached with the occupation of Jerrato. On the 19th, the Italian forces broke through the second line of British defense, which included machine gun and artillery positions, as well as concrete trenches and barbed wire. The total number of British troops was 40,000, while the number of Italian troops has not been announced. (August 21, Hai Tong Dispatch)

### Evacuating British Troops Safely Arrive in Aden

Cairo: An official announcement stated that all British troops evacuated from Berbera, Somaliland, along with most of their equipment and supplies, have now arrived in Aden. The small portion of equipment left behind was destroyed before the withdrawal. There are no changes in the western Shahan region, and there is nothing to report from other fronts. (August 21, Reuters Dispatch)

### French Somaliland: Italy Sees It as a Sure Thing

Rome: The railway from the port of Djibouti in French Somaliland to Addis Ababa is now under Italian management, as stipulated in the Franco-Italian armistice agreement. The railway is 800 kilometers long. After Italy occupied Abyssinia, due to France's control of the port, freight volume was low, only 80,000 tons per year. Currently, Italy has added four motor locomotives and six steam locomotives to increase the railway's transportation capacity. (August 21, Hai Tong Dispatch)

Rome: An Italian official, Stefani News Agency's diplomatic correspondent, issued a direct threat to French Somaliland today. Regarding the British withdrawal from British Somaliland, the correspondent wrote that the people of British Somaliland, like the people of neighboring French Somaliland, have long had a tendency to connect with the people of Italian Somaliland. This has now been realized in British Somaliland, and the day of realization is not far off for French Somaliland, Abyssinia's natural outlet to the sea. (August 21, Reuters Dispatch)

### German Aircraft Active Over Britain: Heavy Bombing on the Southeast Coast; British Aircraft Successfully Attack German Military Areas

London: After two very quiet days over Britain, this morning was once again filled with activity, as German aircraft continued to launch large-scale attacks on cities in the northeast and southeast of England, the Midlands, and coastal areas of Wales. However, German aircraft were quickly repelled by British fighter planes in all areas. One German aircraft flew low over a suburb of a city in the Midlands, bombing and destroying several shops and houses, causing some deaths and injuries, including children. Another German aircraft strafed a busy city on the coast this morning, but fortunately, there were no casualties. A city in the southeast heard the whirring of aircraft in the clouds, but no aircraft were seen, and the sound of a major explosion was heard in the distance, likely caused by a high-explosive bomb. It was reported that a German aircraft near the coast was pursued and shot down by a British Spitfire fighter. According to a joint announcement by the Ministry of Aviation and the Ministry of Internal Security, German aircraft bombed a city in southeastern England this morning, with several bombs falling in a park. Several houses near the train station were also destroyed, and several people were injured. (August 21, Reuters Dispatch)

London: Yesterday, enemy aircraft approached the southeast coast of England in batches, resulting in a fierce battle that lasted for two hours. The outcome is still unknown. A squadron of twenty enemy bombers was forced to change course by fierce anti-aircraft fire. The second squadron of enemy aircraft was also repelled, and their escort fighters failed to attack the barrage balloons and were driven out to sea by British fighters. An airfield on the southeast coast was attacked by enemy dive bombers and sustained only minor damage before the enemy aircraft were repelled. According to a communiqué from the Ministry of Aviation, British bombers conducted daytime reconnaissance over the Netherlands and the North Sea, bombing an anti-aircraft gun position near Amsterdam and the Flugging airfield. One British aircraft did not return. Last night, British aircraft attacked thirty enemy airfields in Germany and enemy-occupied areas, bombed the Kiel naval base in Germany, the oil refinery in Hanover, the power station north of Leipzig, key enemy transportation lines in the Ruhr area and northwestern Germany, and oil tanks near Bordeaux. Two British aircraft were lost. According to a communiqué from the Ministry of Aviation and the Ministry of Internal Security, on Tuesday morning, there was less enemy aircraft activity over Britain. Cities in Essex and South Wales were bombed, with bombs hitting houses, injuring several people, and few fatalities. A port in South Wales was also hit, with minor damage. Yesterday afternoon, large formations of enemy aircraft approached the southeast coast. A town in East Anglia was bombed, with no deaths or injuries, and material damage was limited to shattered windows. The main target of the enemy aircraft's attack yesterday afternoon appeared to be an airfield on the south coast, but the enemy aircraft seemed unable to achieve their attack objectives, so very few enemy aircraft penetrated British defenses, and there was no material damage. Yesterday, a city in the southwest was bombed, killing and injuring several people. In another city in the southwest, a German aircraft flew in, swooped down, and strafed people swimming on the beach, then ascended and strafed the local militia stationed on the cliff top. A British fighter aircraft flew in to intercept it, and the German aircraft fled into the clouds. According to incomplete reports, three enemy aircraft were shot down by British fighters yesterday, and one was shot down by the Polish Air Force squadron of the British Air Force. The Ministry of Aviation announced that it has now been confirmed that another eight enemy aircraft were destroyed by anti-aircraft fire on Sunday. On Sunday night, a German seaplane was shot down by anti-aircraft fire off the northeast coast of England. (August 21, Reuters Dispatch)

### Romanian-Hungarian Negotiations Nearing Rupture; Romanian-Bulgarian Negotiations Underway

Bucharest: Regarding Hungary's territorial claims to Outer Transylvania, the proposals put forward by Romania and Hungary differ greatly. Therefore, it is generally believed that the negotiations between Romania and Hungary held in Turnu Severin are likely to break down and will not resume. The Romanian government's official newspaper, "Romania," stated that Hungary's demands are "excessive and ridiculous, and simply unimaginable." (August 21, Reuters Dispatch)

Craiova: Romanian and Bulgarian delegations opened negotiations here at 11:00 AM yesterday regarding Bulgaria's claim to the Dobruja province of Romania. Romanian officials expressed satisfaction with the so-called "Bulgarian acceptance of Romania's negotiation basis plan." The issue of Silistra seems to be the only difficult problem due to its important military position. (August 21, United Press Dispatch)

### American Ship Loads Tungsten and Antimony in Haiphong

Hong Kong: The Overseas Chinese Daily News recently reported from reliable sources in Haiphong that an American ship loaded tungsten and antimony ore worth US$10 million yesterday, preparing to transport it to the United States. It is believed that the sale of these items to the United States was planned by the former Minister of Finance, Song Ziwen. It is also reported that these items were originally intended to be shipped to Vladivostok under the Sino-Soviet barter trade agreement. (August 21, United Press Dispatch)

### Chinese Chemical Society Holds Its Eighth Annual Meeting in Emei; Will Visit Chengdu and Jiading for Inspection After Closing

Chengdu, August 20 (Dispatch): The eighth annual meeting of the Chinese Chemical Society opened at 9:00 AM yesterday at the School of Law of Sichuan University in Emei. The meeting hall was meticulously decorated. More than 200 members and guests attended the meeting. Wu Baluo, the president of the society, was unable to attend due to transportation difficulties. Zhang Hongyuan, director of the board and chairman of the organizing committee, presided over the meeting. Dai Anbang, director and deputy president, gave a speech. The conference received dozens of congratulatory messages. The instructions and encouragement from the president of the Central Bank, and Ministers Chen and Weng of the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Economy, respectively, were particularly earnest. The President's instructions stated that under the current situation in our country, whether from the perspective of people's livelihood or national defense, the development of science, especially the field of chemistry, is a pressing matter. He also stated that the success or failure of the anti-Japanese war and national reconstruction in the future will be the responsibility of our academic community. When the national foundation is consolidated and the country reveres virtue and rewards merit, our academic community will occupy the most glorious position, bringing welfare to the people and creating peace for all generations. This is the ambition and duty of all of you. Cheng Tianfang, the president of Sichuan University, gave a welcoming speech to the conference and hosted a public banquet for all members at Baoguo Temple in the afternoon. More than 100 papers were presented on the morning of the 20th. In addition, there were several important proposals. The conference schedule is five days in total. After the closing, an inspection group will be organized to visit Chengdu, Jiading and other places to inspect the chemical industry. (August 21 Dispatch)

### Japanese Troops Suffer Losses on the Yongqin Road

Wuming: After the Chinese troops broke through the Japanese strongholds such as Nalan on the Yongqin Road, the Japanese forces entrenched in Xiaohuan increasingly felt isolated. In an attempt to struggle, they gathered a unit on the morning of the 18th, first bombarded fiercely with artillery fire, and then launched an infantry attack towards Nalan, Nabi, Bancheng and other places. After Chinese troops countered and engaged in a fierce battle until noon, the Japanese were defeated, leaving behind more than 180 corpses. (August 21 Dispatch)

### Air Raid Alarm Issued in Chongqing Yesterday

Chongqing: Around noon today, it was reported that four batches of Japanese aircraft had flown into Sichuan Province, and an alarm was issued. However, the Japanese aircraft did not arrive, and the alarm was lifted at 1:30 PM. "It is reported that the Japanese aircraft flew into Sichuan from southern Shanxi and bombed several small villages about 150 miles west of Chongqing." It is heard that Japanese bombers have been protected by fighter planes in the past two days, which has never been seen before. Therefore, it is generally believed that the Japanese army is now using the Yichang airfield to send fighter planes to protect their bombers. (August 21, Reuters Dispatch)

Chongqing: Most of the city of Chongqing was destroyed, and 40,000 homeless people began their evacuation at dawn today. When the usual air raid alarm sounded again at noon, residents had to take shelter in trenches. However, the wartime capital was not attacked today, and Japanese aircraft were not seen during the two-hour alarm. According to the Chinese side, a small group of Japanese aircraft was discovered in Shunqing, 90 miles north of Chongqing. It was also claimed that a Japanese bomber was shot down on August 11 in Shizhu, 80 miles east of Chongqing, and four of the eight crew members were captured alive. According to official estimates, 10,000 people were displaced by the air raid yesterday, and they spent the night in the areas bombed by Japanese aircraft. The United Press reporter investigated the area again this afternoon and saw a group of people from the city gazing at the rubble, as if on a tour. All the people in the city have already moved to the countryside, and only a few have taken their belongings with them. The great fire yesterday was extinguished at dawn today, but wisps of smoke continued to rise. Many Chinese people here say that the ancient city of Chongqing has virtually disappeared from the map. The printing houses of the Xinmin Daily and the Central Daily News were burned down in the past two days, but the Xinmin Daily continued to publish today. The newspaper stated that Japan is imitating Germany in attempting to force the Chinese to surrender with an aerial blitzkrieg, but the morale of the Chinese people has been strengthened as a result. Germany can mobilize 2,000 aircraft at a time, but this Eastern imitator has sent less than 200 naval and air aircraft. The Chinese people should remember the words of Chairman Chiang, "Even if the National Government is in a pile of rubble, it will continue to administer as usual. We can only respond to the enemy's bombing with an even stronger determination." (August 21, United Press Dispatch)

Chongqing: Kang Xinru, the speaker of the Chongqing Municipal Council, made a statement regarding the Japanese air raid on Chongqing, saying that Japanese aircraft are attacking Chongqing day and night, dropping large amounts of bombs or incendiary bombs, with the aim of slaughtering our unarmed civilians. According to the Japanese military spokesman in Hankou, Chongqing has been attacked 38 times in three months, with 3,300 aircraft sorties and 2,500 tons of bombs dropped. The lives and property of our Chongqing citizens will certainly suffer some sacrifice, but their strong and unyielding will to resist will not be shaken by the threat of Japanese aircraft, and will only strengthen our hatred of the enemy. We firmly believe that Chongqing will not be reduced to ruins. Even if it becomes ruins, we are determined to rebuild the glory of the future. We firmly believe that Chongqing is unconquerable, as is the rest of China. The Japanese will never achieve their goal of subjugating us unless they abandon their brutal acts, and they will only reap endless evil consequences. The close cooperation between the air defense department in providing relief to citizens and the government's timely and effective collaboration in displaying the great compassion of rescuing the dying and healing the wounded is enough to reassure our compatriots across the country and international friends. As for the homeless, we will do our best to appeal to the government and people from all walks of life to provide extensive relief. (August 21 Dispatch)

### Principles for Adjusting Court Personnel Established

Chongqing: In order to adjust the number of personnel in courts and prisons and adapt to the complexity of affairs, the Judicial Yuan has formulated three principles for thoroughly adjusting and replenishing court personnel: (1) Regarding prosecutors and clerks, each judge or prosecutor must be assigned a recording clerk. In addition, a number of clerks are established to handle registration and administrative affairs. (2) Regarding accounting and statistics, a separate accounting system is being implemented. Accounting and statistics for judicial organs are particularly important. Therefore, accounting officers and statisticians are specially established in high courts, high branch courts, and local courts with more complex affairs. A new type A prison will also specially establish an accounting officer to emphasize accounting administration. (3) Regarding bailiffs, law enforcement officers, and guards, the jurisdictions of the first and second-level courts in various provinces are very broad, but the number of bailiffs and law enforcement officers is generally small and should be increased appropriately for distribution. As for prison guards, the standard is one guard for every ten prisoners, and one chief guard for every ten guards. (August 21 Dispatch)

Implementing management and establishing a good personnel system; 2. Purifying officialdom; 3. Actively providing food relief; 4. Meticulously reorganizing finance; 5. Stepping up the implementation of the new county administration. Chairman Lin and Chairman Chiang gave many instructions, and there will be a groundbreaking advancement in provincial administration in the future. (August 21 Dispatch)

### Hurricane Hits Hong Kong

Hong Kong: This morning, a violent hurricane 80 miles southeast of Hong Kong is moving west. It is expected to pass through the coastal area south of here today. Hong Kong is now experiencing strong winds and heavy rain, and no small boats can be seen in the harbor. Ocean-going liners are moored in sheltered places. The "Number 9" hurricane signal was hoisted at 6:00 AM. (August 21, Reuters Dispatch)

### Chinese and Foreigners Enthusiastically Bid Farewell: 300 British Troops Left Shanghai Yesterday; More Than 100 British Troops from Tianjin Arrived Here Yesterday; British Troops Requisition Five Ships to Set Sail One After Another

A portion of the British troops ordered to withdraw finally made their move yesterday. Shortly after noon yesterday, cheers were endless along Jing'an Temple Road and Nanjing Road, as large numbers of Western residents were bidding farewell to detachments of the British East Surrey Regiment and the West Yorkshire Regiment. The scene at that time was reminiscent of the grand occasion when British troops first arrived here in 1927. Comparing the two, they were exactly the same. As they departed, the soldiers also cheered loudly along the way to respond to those who were bidding farewell.

Column Moves East with Motorcycle Escort

Those who made the most affectionate farewell to the people of Shanghai yesterday totaled 300. They departed from the British barracks on Great West Road, marched in formation into Hongkou, and boarded the Desheng Wheel steamer bound for Hong Kong. The British troops marched in columns of three abreast. At the start, four motorcycles led the way, one of which belonged to the US Navy Fourth Regiment. This was followed by the US Navy Fourth Regiment's band of about 30 people, led by Mr. Keifen. Among the departing British troops, the East Surrey Regiment was in the front row, followed by the West Yorkshire Regiment's band, and finally the West Yorkshire Regiment detachment.

Parting Sentiments Movingly Touch Hearts

When the British troops passed through Jing'an Temple Road and Nanjing Road, the band played farewell songs, which were moving and emotional. Residents nearby came out to watch, and the sidewalks were crowded with pedestrians, and traffic was temporarily cut off. British and American expatriates waved handkerchiefs and nodded as the column passed, and the soldiers also raised their hands in salute and shouted "Goodbye." Those living in tall buildings also leaned out of the windows, watching and calling out, and some were even filled with tears, following the column with reluctance. The parting sentiments were movingly touching hearts. Photographers with mirror-box cameras also crisscrossed the area. Patrolmen were reinforced along the Bund, and peddlers and beggars had disappeared.

American Troops Play Music to See Them Off

When the column turned from Nanjing Road to the Bund and reached the gate of the British Consulate General, the American military band withdrew from the column, lined up on the side of the road, and began to play farewell music to say goodbye to the British troops. When the British troops passed over the Garden Bridge, the White Russian detachment of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, who were taking over the defense, all raised their guns in salute. The British troops also paid attention and returned the salute. A team of Japanese naval marines was also at the foot of the bridge, saluting the British troops. The British troops continued to advance along Broadway Road to the Gonghexing Wharf and boarded the Desheng Wheel steamer moored there. Their military luggage had already been moved on board the previous day.

British Troops from Tianjin Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Afternoon

Regarding the withdrawal of British troops stationed in China, the British military authorities requisitioned five vessels from Jardine Matheson & Co., namely the Yong Sheng, Hao Sheng, Yi Sheng, and De Sheng, as well as the Great Britain Company's Tanda. The Tanda is returning to Shanghai from Japan today and is scheduled to depart from Shanghai with British troops on the 26th. The De Sheng, carrying 160 British troops stationed in Tianjin, arrived in Shanghai at around 11:00 AM yesterday. It docked at the Roosevelt Wharf, and the British troops disembarked at 2:00 PM. The ship moved from the Roosevelt Wharf to the Yangshupu pontoon at 4:45 PM yesterday (customs time) and anchored. After the British troops returned to the ship, it was scheduled to weigh anchor and depart in the morning.

Yi Sheng Ship Sailed Yesterday

The Yi Sheng moved from the Roosevelt pontoon to the Gonghexing Wharf in Hongkou the day before yesterday. After the British troops boarded the ship yesterday afternoon, it departed at 4:30 PM and sailed south from the Wusongkou at 6:30 PM. The Yong Sheng arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong last Monday and was requisitioned to transport troops. It was then docked for painting. It is reported that it will be completed and leave the dock today and is scheduled to dock at the Gonghexing Wharf in Hongkou. As soon as the British troops board the ship, it will leave Shanghai.

Hao Sheng Repairs Will Be Completed Soon

The Hao Sheng weighs more than 5,600 tons and originally sailed on the Nanyang Singapore and Japan routes. It was also requisitioned to transport troops this time, so after arriving in port last week, it was anchored at pontoons 24 and 25, where it was painted day and night, and the work will be completed soon, awaiting the British troops to board the ship, then it will weigh anchor and depart. It is reported that each vessel will stop briefly in Hong Kong before heading straight to Singapore. The four Jardine Matheson vessels were requisitioned to carry troops, so the cabins were all freshly painted, and the dining halls were also renovated, at a huge cost.

### American Eastern Banking Corporation Continues to Repay Old Debts: More Than 900 Checks Have Been Issued

The American Eastern Banking Corporation, which is currently in liquidation, will repay the second batch of old debts, amounting to one-tenth, to its creditors, who are classified as "Class B" by the US Consular Court in China.

Calculated at the Current Exchange Rate

This amounts to approximately 1,050,000 yuan in legal tender. More than 900 checks are required. The issue date for the checks is August 20 of this year, and they can be cashed at the Bank of Communications at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Sichuan Road. 500 of the checks were mailed to creditors in Shanghai on August 19, and the rest were mailed on the 20th. It is noted that in April 1937, the American Eastern Banking Corporation used

The First Batch of Old Debts

Amounting to two-tenths, to repay "Class B" creditors. Together with this second batch of old debts, this is three-tenths. At that time, the liquidator of the American Eastern Banking Corporation also repaid the old debts of "Class A" creditors in full, after deducting 8% of the liquidation fees payable by the creditors. The repayment of old debts to "Class B" creditors, or those issued today, is the last batch, but there is still a

Possibility of Continuing to Repay a Small Amount

Of old debts in the future. Regarding the liquidation of the American and Foreign Bank, it is noted that the liquidator of the bank once used 37.5% of the old debts to repay depositors and other creditors. The sixth batch of old debts, amounting to 5%, was repaid in September of last year. It is expected that the bank will soon use the last batch of small old debts to repay depositors and other creditors.

### ### Great China Evening News Reporter Cheng Zhenzhang Passed Away Yesterday, Condition Worsened Last Night and Finally Succumbed, Elderly Mother Was Present and Fainted

Cheng Zhenzhang, a reporter for the Great China Evening News, left his home for the office at around 9 a.m. on the 19th. While walking on Avenue Road, two people suddenly jumped out of a car parked on the side of the road, pulled out handguns, and fired two shots at him. One bullet hit his mouth, and the other hit his abdomen. The assailants fled without a trace. He was later taken to Guangci Hospital for treatment in a police car. At that time, there was little bleeding, and he was in good health. After the doctors did their best to perform surgery, his condition seemed good. After a blood transfusion the day before, his condition suddenly worsened, his temperature rose, and he became unconscious. After administering a cardiac injection, he gradually calmed down. By yesterday afternoon, his temperature had risen to over 40 degrees Celsius, and his pulse was 150 beats per minute. At around 6 p.m., he suddenly jumped out of bed, shouting that something was unfinished and he had to take care of it personally. The doctor forcibly held him down and repeatedly comforted him, but his agitation did not subside. At 8:05 p.m., he suddenly passed away. His elderly mother was present and, upon seeing this, was heartbroken and fainted once. She was revived by the hospital staff, who strongly advised her to go home. Currently, the funeral arrangements are being handled by the newspaper. The body was sent to the Wanguo Funeral Home on Jiaozhou Road at 9 p.m. last night, and the funeral date will be chosen later. Mr. Cheng was only 30 years old, unmarried, and lived with his elderly mother, relying on each other. Besides her, he had no close relatives. His sudden and tragic death has caused grief among all who have heard of it.

### British Troops' Abandoned Defense Areas Taken Over by Shanghai Volunteer Corps, Area North of Suzhou Creek Assigned to A Company, Central Area Assigned to White Russian Unit

The British troops' defense area in the western Hongkou district of the International Settlement north of the Suzhou Creek (i.e., the area from North Henan Road to North Xizang Road) was originally scheduled to be taken over by the White Russian Unit of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps starting at 8 p.m. on the 20th. However, according to inquiries made by a Pingming News Agency reporter with relevant parties, the Japanese side actually opposed the White Russian Unit taking over the western Hongkou district and insisted that the area be taken over by the British Unit. At the same time, they also opposed the other units in the Shanghai Volunteer Corps taking over. Therefore, the Shanghai Volunteer Corps Commander Hampeh summoned A Company at 8 p.m. the night before, and the takeover was completed at 10 p.m. It is understood that A Company consists of volunteer members of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, who all have other professions, unlike the White Russian Unit, which is a formally trained army unit. Currently, the central area of the International Settlement, such as the area from the Bund to Yu Qiaqing Road, is still defended by the White Russian Unit.

British Unit Organization

A Company is a British unit of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps. The Jewish Unit is also incorporated into this company, but it was not included in the call-up the night before to take over the area north of the Suzhou Creek. The A Company's British members include over 90 in A Platoon, over 80 in B Platoon, 70 in the Scottish Unit, and over 60 in the British Machine Gun Unit (i.e., the anti-aircraft unit), for a total of over 300 including officers. According to the quota, each platoon should have 120 people, so there is a considerable shortage.

Six Areas Taken Over. A Company took over the British troops' defense areas at 10 p.m. the night before, totaling six areas: 1. The intersection of Boundary Road and Baoshan Road; 2. The Qianjiang Guild Hall at the intersection of North Henan Road and Haining Road; 3. The First Special District Court on North Zhejiang Road; 4. The Dry Bridge Entrance on North Zhejiang Road; 5. The iron gate at the border of the Concession on Kaifeng Road; 6. The vicinity of the pseudo "Central Market" on North Xizang Road. Among the British barracks, the First Special District Court serves as the headquarters of A Company.

Japanese Side Denies Stationing Troops in Western Shanghai

Yesterday, at a reception for Western newspaper reporters, a Japanese naval spokesman denied reports that Japanese naval landing forces had stationed troops in the western Shanghai defense area. The spokesman said that any Japanese troops seen in the area were soldiers going to guard Japanese-owned textile mills. When reporters asked whether patrol duties in the western Shanghai area would be taken over by the navy or the army, the spokesman replied that he had not yet received reports on this issue, and the date on which Japanese troops would be stationed in the area had not yet been decided. The spokesman also said that the Japanese authorities in Shanghai were unaware of any discussions taking place between the United States and Japan regarding the Shanghai defense area, but this did not mean that such discussions did not exist.

### Tribute Rice Arrives in Shanghai Continuously, Prices Fall Steadily

The tribute rice ordered at the beginning of this month has been shipped to Shanghai in succession. Shipments have been arriving daily recently. It is reported that from January to June this year, a total of 1,875,269 piculs of foreign rice were shipped to Shanghai (each picul is 160 city pounds; two piculs is one bag; each bag is one dan two dou and a half), worth 3,487,636 national currency. Among them, Annam accounted for the largest share, with 1,135,106 piculs, followed by Siam with 541,970 piculs, and Burma third with 181,376 piculs. According to the current daily rice consumption in Shanghai, calculated at 9,000 dan, the supply is indeed very abundant. Yesterday's fair price sales were extremely crowded, and rice prices in various shops fell by about 6 jiao.

### Eastern Zhejiang Suffers No Damage Despite Repeated Bombings, Shengxian, Changle, and Jinhua Bombed, Japanese Warships Shell Fortress Again

According to a telegram from Jinhua received yesterday by Zhejiang groups in Shanghai, at 7:58 a.m. on the 20th, two Japanese planes were spotted in Xushan, flying from northeast to southwest. The Japanese planes then passed over Yuyao, Xikou, and Xinchang, circling once over Xinchang before entering the airspace of Shengxian. After circling, they dropped two bombs, one landing in the Qiantang River and the other in a field. They then flew to Changle and dropped six bombs, causing destruction before heading east towards Dongyang, Shaoxing, and Baiguan before heading out to sea.

Bombing of Wulishan

Also, at 8 a.m. the day before, two Japanese planes appeared, flying from east to south. They circled three times over Zhuji before entering the airspace of Yiwu, circling twice, and then entering the airspace of Jinhua, circling for a long time. They also blindly dropped thirteen bombs on Wulishan in Jinhua, causing no damage. At 1:23 p.m., a Japanese plane was also spotted over Yuhuan, then flew towards Wenling, Haimen, Ninghai, Fenghua, Xikou, and Guanhaiwei before heading out to sea.

Shelling of Zhenhai

Japanese warships outside Zhenhai Port suddenly opened fire again the day before, shelling the Zhenhai fortress. It was found that the Japanese warships opened fire at 7:40 a.m. A Japanese warship sailed from the Lichang waters to Zhenhai Port and suddenly fired eleven shots at the south bank of the Yangtze River without any target. The shells all landed in the sand, causing no damage. After opening fire, the Japanese warship still sailed to the Lichang waters and anchored there. It had not left by yesterday morning. It is reported that the defending forces are currently monitoring it.

### Shanghai-Fujian Resumption of Navigation Negotiations Have Not Yielded Results, Gulu and Wenzhou Bombed (Separate Reports)

Regarding the issue of third-country shipping on the Shanghai-Fujian route, Mr. Zhang Zhonghe, the Chinese manager of the British-owned Yilong Company, told Pingming News Agency reporters yesterday that there is little hope of resumption in the near future. The company's authorities' negotiations with the Japanese side through the British Consulate have not yielded any results. Rumors that the Jianghai Customs has allowed Fuqing in Fujian Province to clear customs, revealing a glimmer of hope for the Shanghai-Fujian shipping route, are actually premature. Furthermore, rumors that the company's Shenai Wheel has sailed to Yantai to seek other developments are also untrue. The wheel is still staying in Shanghai. All of the company's ships are stranded in Shanghai awaiting orders and are not currently considering changing to other routes. He also said that because the matter concerns business, we have no choice but to argue for the resumption of navigation based on reason.

Shenhua Aftermath

Regarding the issue of the Yilong Company's Shenhua Wheel being robbed, the opinions of the robbed passengers and the company are still quite divergent. Pingming News Agency reporters separately inquired with the Yilong Company authorities and the Fujian Provincial Association yesterday. The Fujian passengers who were robbed, in addition to asking the association to make four demands to Yilong, also stated yesterday that if these demands are not accepted by Yilong, they will not hesitate to resort to the law. It is also learned that these four demands were sent to the company by the Relief Committee this morning, and the results will be discussed at the association's executive meeting this afternoon.

Yilong's Attitude

However, the Yilong Company authorities stated that they have no obligation to fulfill these conditions. According to the Chinese manager of the company, they will naturally agree to the clause that "once navigation is smooth, the company's first ship should first carry the passengers who were robbed this time back to Fujian free of charge," and they are also very sympathetic to allocating funds to relieve the robbed passengers. However, if this matter is raised as a responsibility-style condition and for compensation for losses, etc., then it seems that there is no obligation to fulfill it.

Xijiang Arrives in Shanghai

According to news from the French Postal Ship Company yesterday, the company's Xijiang Wheel arrived in Shanghai from Kobe, Japan, at about 10 a.m. yesterday and moored at buoys 14 and 15. Because the wheel brought many passengers and goods from Kobe, it was originally scheduled to sail eastward tonight but has been postponed to 8 a.m. on the 24th and will sail directly to Haiphong without stopping at ports. According to the company, there were not many passengers on this voyage, which is presumably due to the current situation. However, there were many goods and cargo being transported.

Small Wheel Sails to Songmen

The German-owned Huilinyang Company's Gaodeng Wheel has decided to sail to Songmen and other places in the Zhejiang sea mouth on the 24th of this month. Yesterday, the vessels sailing to Songmen included the Yian Foreign Company's Lima Wheel and Liping Wheel, which sailed to Songmen on the 19th. There is no news of their arrival yet. Both of these wheels are less than 50 tons, with very small hulls and small capacity, and cannot carry cargo.

Gulu Bombed

When Japanese planes bombed Gutoutou on the 8th of this month, there were a total of three Japanese planes. After reconnoitering over Bijiang Town and Pingyang County, they flew towards Ruian. Then, they returned and dropped a bomb in the bamboo forest under Fangyan across the river from Gutoutou, destroying one thatched house and more than 200 bamboo poles, killing two civilians and injuring one woman. Afterwards, they flew to the Bijiang Lingxipu Riverbank and dropped a bomb and strafed with machine guns, killing six people, injuring eight, and sinking five civilian boats and one sailboat, and damaging six civilian boats.

Wenzhou Attacked

Wenzhou was bombed by Japanese planes on the 11th of this month, with a total of nine bombs dropped. It is said that bombs fell in the vicinity of the New Pier, four bombs fell on Paotai Island, and one 100-pound bomb fell on Futoumen, with unknown losses.

### Kong Xianfen Narrowly Escapes Kidnapping, Fortunate to Avoid Danger Due to Alertness, Bandits Attempted to Drag Kong into Car, Fortunate that Loud Cries for Help Scared Away Bandits

At the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Route Muriel at around 8:45 a.m. yesterday, a failed kidnapping occurred. The victim was Kong Xianfen, who was fortunate to avoid danger due to his own alertness and loud cries for help. The details are as follows:

One Bandit Stops Car, Attempts Kidnapping

Kong Xianfen, styled Songsheng, is 43 years old and lives at No. 6, Lane 75, Route Muriel. At around 8:45 a.m. yesterday, Kong left his residence in a chartered car to run errands. As soon as the car left the lane, after traveling for dozens of steps to the vicinity of the Fuxiang Lumber Company at the corner of Route Muriel and Avenue Joffre, a bandit suddenly jumped out from the side of the road and stopped the car. At the same time, he attempted to drag Kong out of the car and force him into a car that had been lying in wait there.

Struggles Vigorously, Fortunately Escapes Danger

At this time, Kong saw that the situation was not good and immediately struggled vigorously and shouted for help. The chauffeur was also anxious and shouted. The bandit, fearing that the police stationed at Avenue Joffre would be unfavorable to him, abandoned Kong and fled, jumping into a bandit car on the side of the road and driving away quickly, disappearing without a trace. Kong saw that the bandit car had left and immediately had the chauffeur report the attempted kidnapping to the nearby police. A revolver was found nearby, and a suspect was apprehended together with the client and taken to the police station. After the police chief reported the incident, he urgently ordered Chinese and Western detectives to rush to the scene to investigate. On the one hand, they were pursuing the bandits based on the client's description of the bandits' appearance and clothing. However, the number plate of the bandit car could not be recalled on the spot. The police are currently investigating.

### Ke Zijiewei Sends Letter to Thank All Police Officers

The special precautions taken by the authorities of the two concessions starting on the 9th of this month have been quite successful. The anniversary of the "August 13th" Songhu Anti-Japanese War was able to pass under strict military and police precautions. In addition to sending a letter to the Shanghai Volunteer Corps Commander Hampeh to express his gratitude, Ke Zijiewei, the Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, also sent a letter to Smith, the Commissioner of Police, yesterday, stating that during the past period of special precautions, all special police officers and others made great contributions to assisting with the precautions, which consequently reduced the number of violations. Therefore, the results were very satisfactory. This special letter is sent to express thanks and for your information.

### French Concession Rent Committee Convenes Second General Meeting, Chinese Language Group Discussed Disputes between Second Landlords and Third Tenants the Day Before

The French Concession Rent Investigation Committee is scheduled to convene its second plenary meeting in early next month. At that time, French Consul General Oren and members of the committee's various subcommittees will attend. Pingming News Agency reporters learned from the committee's secretariat yesterday that the secretariat has distributed notices of the convocation of the second general meeting to the Chinese, French, and English subcommittees, urging them to quickly sort out the various materials recently collected in order to provide a basis for research and discussion when the general meeting is held.

Chinese Language Group Holds Joint Meeting

Furthermore, the first and second groups of the committee's Chinese language group held their fourth joint meeting at 8 p.m. the day before at the French Concession Taxpayer Association. The attendees included Chairman Lan Xuzhang, Committee Members Zhu Wende, Xu Jashi, and Wang Runniu, totaling five people. Mr. Zhang and Mr. Dai, who had previously submitted opinions to the committee, were also invited to attend. Their statements were roughly as follows: Rent disputes often occur between second landlords and third tenants. The reason for this is that second landlords often take advantage of the special situation of Shanghai being overcrowded and impose various unduly harsh conditions on third tenants, such as using fixed-term leases to evict tenants who have reached the end of their term, increasing rents without end, and unreasonably restricting the use of water and electricity. All of these methods are used to the extreme. In short, second landlords often use their superior position to seek excessive profits, resulting in endless disputes and affecting public order. The Rent Committee should find ways to adjust this. After discussion, the subcommittee agreed to accept these opinions as a reference for promoting its work.

### Chief Nurse's Sudden Death Case, Perjury Portion of Trial Concluded, Sentencing Scheduled for the 28th

Li Wangying, also known as Jie Ru, a woman from Pingtan, Fujian, who was the chief nurse at the Zhongxi Sanatorium at No. 536 Bushi Road, was 31 years old this year. She had worked at the hospital for nine years and remained single. On the Dragon Boat Festival on June 10 of this year, she went home to visit her family and then returned to the hospital to sleep. Unexpectedly, at around 10 a.m. the next morning, her nephew Li Konglan came to the hospital to ask his aunt for an injection, but Li Yuying was already lying stiff in bed, her body cold. She had been dead for a long time. Lu Zhenqing (from Beiping, 39 years old this year, son of the hospital's director Lu Zhong'an), the hospital's administrator, notified the Chinese Funeral Home to transport the body to the funeral home for embalming. Afterwards, he ordered Dr. Lin Zhengliang (38 years old, from Ningbo) to issue a death certificate stating that Li Yuying died of a stroke, without reporting to the police station in accordance with the regulations of concession hospitals. Just as the coffin was about to be buried in the Hongqiao Cemetery, someone using the pseudonym Lei Huayun separately sent letters to the Fujian Fellow Villagers Association, the Second Special Court, and the French Police Department, reporting that Li Yuying's death was unclear and requesting an investigation and prosecution. Subsequently, Zhao Changmin, the prosecutor of the Second Special Court, investigated Lu Zhenqing and Lin Zhengliang and believed that they were indeed suspected, and filed a public prosecution with this court on charges of fabricating evidence. The details have been reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday morning, the case was tried by Judge Zhu Chuzhe with Prosecutor Zhao at the Second Criminal Court. First, according to Lin Zhengliang's statement, he graduated from the medical department of St. John's University and had been working as a doctor in Shanghai sanatoriums. He transferred to Zhongxi Hospital before July. Perhaps I was not in the hospital at the time of death. I arrived at the hospital in the afternoon and learned that the deceased had been sent to the funeral home. I only issued a certificate of death from stroke on the 14th, because I had treated the deceased's illness and given her eight injections before she died. Therefore, according to my academic observations, perhaps she died of a stroke. However, it was not Lu who forced me to issue it. The court immediately questioned him: Why did you say that Mu Ming'er issued it during the investigation last time, and now you suddenly changed your testimony? Lin hesitated. According to Lu Zhenqing's statement, my father is the executive director of Zhongxi Hospital. I was appointed by the board of directors as the director of the hospital and sent to assist my father in managing the hospital affairs. I graduated from Beiping Medical University. On the day of the deceased's death, I originally intended to report to the police station, but the deceased's parents did not want an autopsy, so I notified the funeral home to embalm the body and had Dr. Lin issue a certificate. The court, believing that the case was clear, ordered the same debate. Prosecutor Zhao then stood up and prosecuted Lu Zhenqing for the crime of instigating others to fabricate evidence, and Lin Zhengliang for the crime of fabricating evidence. The two defendants commissioned lawyers Ling Changyan and Shan Yuhua to defend them. The court hearing scheduled the verdict for the 28th. The two defendants were released on their original bail.

### At Yile Tian Teahouse, Consuming Tea and Arguing, Axe-Wielding Assailant Attacks, Severely Wounding Two People, Assailant Flees Afterwards

At 7:40 p.m. last night, several people were sitting around a table in Yile Tian Teahouse on Nanjing Road, consuming tea and arguing. They disagreed, and a verbal dispute arose, followed by mutual beatings. Suddenly, one person pulled out a sharp axe and attacked Li Gongjian (33 years old, from Anhui) and Chen Asheng (40 years old), severely injuring them. Li Gongjian's waist and lower abdomen were severely wounded, his intestines protruding, and he fell to the ground. Chen Asheng was also severely injured. The assailants dispersed. The injured two people were taken to Renji Hospital for treatment by patrolmen. Li Gongjian's injuries are quite serious, and his life may be in danger.

### Sentai Money Shop Accountant Embezzles Large Sum of Money, Huo Ganquan Flees, Yan Zhurong Implicated and Arrested

The Sentai Money Shop at No. 517 Sichuan Road was established by Zhang Taihe. He originally employed Huo Ganquan as an accountant. Recently, Zhang discovered that Huo frequented dance halls and spent money lavishly, so he was very suspicious. Therefore, he recently hired Yan Zhurong from Zhenjiang as an accountant to supervise him. After Yan took over, he immediately discovered that Huo had embezzled thousands of yuan in funds. At Huo's request, he did not report it. Later, when the owner checked the accounts, Huo returned the embezzled funds in full, so it was not exposed. On the 4th of this month, Huo begged Yan again, saying that he planned to engage in speculation and borrowed a large sum of money. Yan actually lent him a total of 17,500 yuan in cash and US dollar bills. A few days ago, Zhang Taihe suddenly ordered the accounts to be cleared again. Huo was unable to repay the money in time and fled. After Zhang found out, he reported it to the General Police Station. After investigation by Chinese detective Han Shouyou, Yan was detained for aiding and abetting embezzlement. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The police lawyer Ru Baozhen requested that he be temporarily detained as further investigation was required. After questioning by Judge Xiao, he ordered him to be detained pending rescheduling of the trial.

### Three Arch-Criminals Involved in Over Forty Cases

Shang Wu, the Chinese detective chief of the municipal police, and Ma Bingzhang, a detective, previously arrested ten arch-criminals in the Anle, Changzhou Jie Road, and Zhonghua three hotels in North Zhejiang Road. The arrested included Chuan Zhengfu, Wang Zhangzhong, Yuan Xiaomao, and the women Chuan Linshi and Yao Shenshi, all from Shaoxing. They were sent to a special court for detention.

### Apprentice Carpenter Kills Cook

Ni Ahu, a 19-year-old apprentice carpenter from Pudong at the Shuntai Construction Company located at 631 Julu Road in the French Concession, had a poor reputation and often stole items from his colleagues, leading to his being looked down upon. Recently, Cai Binglang (40 years old), a cook from Chongming working for the same company, discovered that Ni was responsible for the theft of some items within the company. He reported this to the accounting department the day before yesterday afternoon, resulting in Ni's reprimand and dismissal. As Ni was unable to return home immediately, he was allowed to stay at the company temporarily. Unexpectedly, Ni became deeply unhappy due to his dismissal, causing him to toss and turn in bed at night. Cai, who shared the room with him, noticed his restlessness and suspected him of further misconduct. He accused Ni of stealing again. Ni, being young and impulsive, took a sharp axe around 5:00 AM yesterday morning, while Cai was still asleep, and struck Cai violently on the head, killing him instantly. After the incident, Ni fled to 528 Avenue Joffre, where he was eventually apprehended. He is currently in police custody for interrogation.

### Qinghua Agricultural Research Institute: Plant Physiology Group's Work, and Manufacturing Applied Chemistry Instruments to Meet Urgent Needs

(Kunming News) The main work of the Plant Physiology Group at the National Qinghua University Agricultural Research Institute originally focused on physiology. Due to the war, it has temporarily also been researching applied biology problems. The following is a summary of the group's recent work over the past year and a half:

(A) Regarding Practical Issues

(1) Utilization of Vegetable Oils: Extraction and utilization of castor oil, tung oil, and turpentine, led by Tang Peisong and others. Yunnan castor oil, after appropriate treatment, can be used as a lubricating oil for machines, trains, cars, and airplanes. Tung oil can be used to make candles and shoe polish, and can also replace paraffin wax for making biological sections. A special article has been published in the American Stain Technology magazine. The candle-making process has obtained a patent from the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Furthermore, research on tung trees and tung oil has received funding from the Rockefeller Foundation. By applying chemicals to tung branches, roots can be generated in a short period.

(2) Utilization of Plant Growth Hormones: The group can be considered a pioneer in the research and utilization of growth hormones in China. Science contains Hu Dujing's research report on eight economic plants (privet, ash, kapok, etc.). According to the report, plants treated with growth hormones all develop roots quickly.

(3) Using Chemical Methods to Produce Polyploid Plants: Using the chemical action of colchicine to increase the number of chromosomes in plant cells, transforming them into polyploid plants. This is a new discovery in genetics and breeding in the last two or three years. The group is currently collaborating with the Sichuan Agricultural Improvement Institute to focus on large-scale polyploid plant breeding research, especially focusing on the breeding and improvement of rice, wheat, barley, oats, and legumes.

(4) Applied Chemistry Work: 1. Synthesis of plant growth hormones. Due to wartime equipment limitations, production is limited. Plans are underway to scale up production to meet demand. 2. Production of anhydrous pure alcohol. Previously, approximately 30 gallons were produced, which was used by various biology departments in the country for experiments.

(5) Instrument Manufacturing: The institute has a workshop for manufacturing various metal instruments, wooden products, and blown glass products.

(B) Regarding Physiological Issues

(1) Experiments on Plant Stimulus Conduction: Using electrical principles and instruments to explore the physical mechanisms of plant stimulus conduction.

(2) Research on National Nutrition: The group is currently collaborating with the Red Cross Rescue Headquarters to investigate and improve the diet and nutrition of Chinese soldiers. It is also planning to promote rational food types and production for the military and the entire country.

(3) Promoting Plant Development: Using physical methods such as temperature and chemical agents and growth hormones to shorten the maturity of plants.

(4) Cell Respiration: Tang Peisong has conducted research on seed respiration. Recently, he published an article in the Annual Review of Biology reviewing cell respiration in recent years, discussing this issue in detail.

### Zhao Jingshen Creates "An Introduction to Literary Chinese"

There is a major unresolved issue in Chinese language education: elementary school students are accustomed to learning vernacular Chinese, but when they enter junior high school, they suddenly have to learn literary Chinese, which they find difficult to understand. This is due to the lack of a literary Chinese foundation in elementary school. To solve this problem, Beixin Bookstore has specially invited Zhao Jingshen to create "An Introduction to Literary Chinese" as a supplementary textbook for elementary school. It consists of four volumes, one for each semester, each priced at two and a half jiao. It includes translations between literary and vernacular Chinese and includes grammar lessons to demonstrate methods of understanding. The selected texts are also short and easy to understand. It is reported that many schools have already adopted it.

### Opportunity to Learn Rabbit Farming Techniques

The Huinong Rabbit Farm at 230 Lujia Road in the Western District of this city raises various types of fur rabbits on a large scale. In order to promote the rabbit farming industry and promote rural production, it has established a rabbit farming technical training class at the farm, hiring expert Professor Feng Huanwen to oversee everything. The current session plans to recruit ten students, with a graduation period of six months. Tuition and practical fees are waived. Interested parties can request a copy of the regulations from the China Agricultural Bookstore on Jiaotong Road in this city.

### School News Roundup

Guoqiang Middle School: Since its establishment, Guoqiang Middle School has followed the educational spirit of Nanyang Middle School for decades. Among the 185 applicants for this year's enrollment, 32 were denied participation in the entrance exam due to their unkempt appearance or frivolous behavior. In the end, only 36 were admitted. The school authorities were displeased with the poor performance of the examinees. It is rumored that another enrollment exam will be held on August 30th, but students with poor academic or behavioral records are discouraged from applying.

Sanlin Commercial Vocational School: Sanlin Commercial Vocational School and Elementary School have been located in the Pudong countryside for more than forty years. The school has a simple academic atmosphere and strict discipline. Even after moving to Shanghai, the school has remained unaffected by the superficial environment. The school board believes that living is currently difficult and that in order to reduce the burden on students' families and maintain low tuition fees, they are raising funds to make up for the shortfall. It is reported that the school will re-select teachers this semester, with new hires including commercial teachers Zhu Gongyan and Wu Mingxin, English teacher Lu Guanqun, Chinese teachers Li Yunzhou and Guan Xibin, and mathematics and science teacher Li Weiqin.

Mingguo Elementary and Middle School: Mingguo Elementary and Middle School on Weihaiwei Road has been operating for nearly thirty years. Teaching has always been serious and management has always been strict. Graduates from all classes are able to cope with their studies and employment, earning the praise of society. The school was fully enrolled early this semester. There were quite a few who failed to meet expectations after the admission examination. The school recently approved the request of parents of students and generally asked to increase classes. The school's ordinary classes are full and cannot accommodate them. For the sake of popularity, it was decided to expand the half-day classes. It is rumored that the tuition for the school's half-day classes is extremely low, almost on a voluntary basis. The teachers are all well-educated. It is also learned that the opening date for the elementary school department of the school is the 22nd, and the middle school department is the 26th.

### Finance: New York Pound at Official Price, Local Foreign Exchange Sterling Flat, US Dollar Loose

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's list showed no ups and downs. In the black market, Sterling was flat, and the US dollar suddenly loosened, because the New York pound price had risen above the official price. From all perspectives, the United States' entry into the European War is becoming more active. Operators considered the news negative, so they sold out. However, HSBC was willing to buy in, and outsiders also absorbed, so it stabilized after loosening. At closing, the US dollar was 5.59375 yuan, and Sterling was stable at 3 pounds 703125 yuan. The US dollar was up 0.0625, and Sterling was flat. There was active trading in Sterling and US dollar in the morning, but no market on Wednesday afternoon.

Foreign Exchange Continues to Be Sold Off

Early in the morning, the London big deal was close to 20.0625, the New York silver price was still flat, and the London gold was stable. The exchange rate between Sterling and the US dollar was unchanged, and the rate against Shanghai was also flat. The US dollar was up one and a half cents against Sterling, at 4.03 yuan, and down three cents against Shanghai. There was no market against France. The central government's list of exchange rates remained unchanged. At the opening, banks quoted the spot selling price of Sterling at 3 pounds 703125 yuan and the US dollar at 5.53125 yuan, both flat compared to the previous evening's close. After the opening, Chinese speculators unanimously sold, and the market had hardened. It is estimated that the American banks and Youli bought US dollars for August at 5.5625 yuan and 5.59375 yuan, while simultaneously opening for September at 5.5625 yuan. HSBC's list was released and remained unchanged. The silver equalization tax remained unchanged. Thereafter, American banks also switched to selling, because HSBC had the ability to absorb and the potential was still stable. It is estimated that HSBC absorbed American banks' spot US dollars at 5.59375 yuan. Then Chinese banks in Shanghai and American banks sold US dollars for September to foreign banks, still at 5.5625 yuan. By the time of closing, everyone felt relieved, but there were no transactions and prices were rarely changed. As a result of the closing, spot Sterling was flat at 3 pounds 703125 yuan, the US dollar was up 0.0625 at 5.59375 yuan, Sterling for September was up 0.015625 at 3 pounds 6875 yuan, and the US dollar was up 0.0625 at 5.5625 yuan.

### U.S. Dollar Weakens; Cash Declines

Yesterday, spot cash was sluggish and trending downwards in the gray market. This is because the foreign exchange market is still tight, but expected to ease. It is generally believed that in the near future, it will not tend to weaken. The rumors of the United States entering the war are all negative factors. Therefore, the trading volume on the surface has been very disparate, with only a certain money exchange firm buying, while sellers came in droves, making it unsustainable. Despite several attempts to pull it up, the minority could not defeat the majority, and it finally fell. The opening price in the morning was 5,710 yuan. After a certain money exchange firm bought, it immediately rose to 5,730 yuan. Soon, gold and silver shops came to unload, falling to 5,685 yuan. Later, the money exchange firm re-entered, pushing it back outside the 5,700 yuan mark. However, before closing, it had fallen to a low of 5,678 yuan. The midday close was still at 5,700 yuan, a decrease of 52 yuan compared to the previous day's settlement. Trading was still active in the morning, with approximately 1,700 to 1,800 taels. Silver jewelry shops ultimately lowered the price by a small 10 yuan, while customs gold remained flat.

Spot Cash Drops 40 Yuan

Since the morning, each bar (ten taels) initially saw a drop of 30 yuan upon opening due to weak market sentiment. A gold shop released 20 taels of silver shop, priced at 5,710 yuan. Shortly thereafter, reliant on the money exchange firm competing to buy, it once rebounded by 20 yuan. The money exchange firm took in 50 taels from gold shops, etc., at 5,730 yuan. Soon after, foreign exchange reports showed easing, and gold and silver shops resumed unloading. Before long, a certain silver building suddenly released a large amount on behalf of a large client. Although securities firms occasionally bought, it was still broken into the 5,700 yuan mark. Gold shops released 10 taels of silver shops, trading at 5,685 yuan. Afterwards, sellers decreased, and fortunately, the money exchange firm revived buying interest, returning the price to 5,708 yuan. Ultimately, due to the foreign exchange easing, gold shops took advantage of the high price to sell again, and the market fell again. Silver shops released 20 taels of cash shops, retreating to 5,678 yuan. However, before closing, fortunately, the securities firms' buying interest re-emerged, and the silver building that initially sold also slightly re-entered, so the closing price was still 5,700 yuan, resulting in a drop of 52 yuan compared to the previous day's settlement. The fluctuation in the morning was also 52 yuan. There was no market in the afternoon, but there were some transactions outside the market, with the price gradually falling to 5,690 yuan. Finally, with a lack of buyers, the cash shop's own-brand gold sold for a price that was ten yuan higher than the spot price. The buying price was reduced by 30 yuan, and the current standard gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the list price, with few people opening trades.

Jewelry Gold Reduced by a Small 10 Yuan

Initially, the price for each tael of silver jewelry sold by silver shops remained at 590 yuan among the major firms. Around 11:15, it was reduced by a small 10 yuan, and there were no changes after that. The major firms changed the price to 580 yuan. The new firms had the same price as above, and the buying price was reduced by about 30 yuan.

### U.S. Dollar Tickets Fall, While Japanese Currency Rises

Yesterday, in the foreign currency market, the spot market trended downwards. British and American gold pounds also fell by one yuan each. There was an ample supply of British gold tickets, and the market price fell by two cents. The decline in U.S. dollar tickets was very intense, due to rumors that the United States was about to join the European war, and various pro-seller rumors. As a result, various parties flooded the market with supply, and it retreated to 17 yuan, 7 jiao, and 3 fen in the afternoon, a drop of 2 jiao compared to the previous day's settlement. There was still a strong demand for Hong Kong tickets, and the market price increased by one cent. The rise in Japanese gold tickets became more intense, reaching a high of 1 yuan, 4 jiao, and 1 fen in the evening market. The supply and demand for Korean tickets was still even, and the market price remained flat, remaining at the original level of 1 yuan and 6 fen in the evening market.

### Discount Rate Rises by Only One Yuan

Yesterday, the discount rate for foreign exchange drafts continued to rise slightly. In the morning, the discount rate was 37 yuan per thousand for those discounting out and 35 yuan for those discounting in. In the afternoon, it was 36 yuan for discounting out and 38 yuan for discounting in, an increase of one yuan compared to the previous day. The interest rate for interbank lending within the association did not change, with both the morning and afternoon markets quoting 1 jiao and 5 fen.

### New Chinese Dime Notes: Bright and Striking

Recently, there has been a shortage of one-yuan banknotes and one-dime and two-dime subsidiary currency notes in the city, especially one-dime notes, which are rarely seen on the market. Most of the circulating notes are old and broken five-fen notes from the Central Bank. It is now heard that HSBC has freshly shipped new ten-cent notes from the Bank of China from Hong Kong, with a rather beautiful design and good paper. The front is red and the back is white. A reproduction of the design is specially made to the right, but it is not easy for various sectors to obtain these new dime notes, which seems to offset their function of adjustment. It is hoped that the supply will be greatly increased.

### Oilcloth Speculation Goes Awry

The oil market has been greatly affected by the continued decline in production prices over the past two days. Previously, general firms predicted that foreign merchants would be involved in production areas, and therefore hoarded a lot, leading to excitement and rising prices. However, actual sales could not keep up, and the production price also fell slightly, causing speculative hoarding to rush out, and the market atmosphere sank. The number of transactions also decreased. Yesterday, in addition to 400 pieces of land cargo Jiaozhou raw oil being settled for survival, other transactions included 200 pieces of spot Jiaozhou raw oil, priced at 63 yuan; 50 pieces of Yantai raw oil, priced at 63 yuan; 20 barrels of Qingdao raw oil, priced at 94 yuan; 50 pieces of Bingqi soybean oil, priced at 71 yuan; 50 barrels of Dasu soybean oil, priced at 98 yuan; and 200 dan of Dayouyu Factory soybean oil, priced at 76 yuan and 3 jiao.

On the 22nd, 250 bags of soybeans were shipped to Hong Kong, and another 1,075 bags were shipped to Singapore. There were also 620 pieces of soybean cake and 500 bags of raw kernels shipped to Singapore, as well as 100 bags of raw kernels, 1,000 cans of raw oil, 388 bags of sesame seeds, and 300 cans of sesame oil shipped to Hong Kong. The day before yesterday, 1,206 cans of tung oil were shipped from Tianjin.

### Securities: After Six Consecutive Days of Gains, Domestic Debt Continues to Rise, with Another Yuan Increase

Yesterday, the bullish trend in the gray market for securities became more and more vigorous. The market situation advanced all the way from morning to night. After six consecutive days of gains, there was actually a sharp increase of one yuan, which has not been seen in recent months. There is an abundance of idle capital, and more and more people are collecting spot goods. However, the rumors on the market are still baseless, using extremely vivid and detailed language, but they are all spread after the market has already risen sharply, and most of them are embellishments. The situation is not yet clear, so there may be a slight pullback today, but it will not be a sharp drop. Yesterday morning, buyers were most active in China One and Ji Kee. Hong Da, Tong Hing, and Jin Wei were also not weak. Union Benefit and Union Harmony also had purchases. The 20th and 38th bulls came out in large numbers, but the market price did not waver. Runli and Tong Kang continued to sell, and the chips were still in short supply. The price rose by 5 jiao to 7 jiao in the morning. Trading was particularly active in the afternoon. Hong Da, Tong Hing, Union Benefit, Xinfu, Le Mao, and Union Harmony also added to their positions or covered their shorts, while the 20th and 38th cuts were still very active. Tong Kang still had sales. The rest, such as retail investors, were sometimes bullish and sometimes bearish, and were exhausted from running around. Yongchang's trading gradually unfolded. As a result of market competition, the price continued to rise by 8 jiao to 1 yuan, with a transaction volume of about 1.7 to 1.8 million yuan. A concise table is listed below.

Stock Trading: 200 shares of China Merchant Electric were traded at a price of 5 yuan and 6 jiao 5 fen.

Yesterday, the stock market opened extremely strong, and the prices of various stocks almost all soared. Later, due to the surge in profit-taking and short selling, the bullish trend was immediately suppressed, and the market situation softened slightly at the close. There were rumors of a strike at British Union, but the price of the stock stabilized. Interest in trading rubber stocks was greater than before.

London, 20th (Wednesday) dispatch: Today, the listed market prices of Chinese foreign debt and Far East British companies' stocks remained flat. Only HSBC Bank's London-registered shares rose by half a pound, priced at 62 and a half pounds. Hong Kong-registered shares remained unchanged, and there were no other gains or losses.

### Food: Rice Prices Rebound

After fluctuating for two days, the foreign rice market suddenly saw actual sales take advantage of the flat price to make prominent purchases. For a time, floating hoarding and retail investors stirred up trouble, resulting in a shift from the flat and tired state of the past few days to a firm and unusually strong state, rising by more than one yuan. Actual sales then turned lukewarm due to the high price, and floating profit-takers took advantage of the high price to release their goods, but it was already close to the closing time, so the market was still 6 jiao to 7 jiao higher than the previous market. Number One Chen Saigon was priced at 58 yuan and 6 jiao, New Tip at 57 and a half yuan, Number Two at 53 yuan and 2 jiao, 53 yuan, Number One Luo Siam at 58 and a half yuan, 58 yuan. It is rumored that the request for a transport certificate for 100,000 bags requested by the inland party will be signed in the coming days, and the Shantou party is also taking action. In addition to buying a small amount of spot rice, they are also very focused on returning the original packages. Siam Number Two opened at 60 yuan, then rose to 62 and a half yuan, another increase of one yuan compared to the previous market. Saigon Number Two opened directly at 62 yuan and 9 jiao, and the market was still calling higher. Total transactions amounted to six or seven hundred tons, with more than 8,000 bags of spot goods opened. Futures rice once saw a soft market before closing, due to floating holders releasing their goods, but it recovered its bullishness at the close.

More than 40 dan of new Zhoupu japonica rice arrived and sold quickly and smoothly, so the price was difficult to show alongside other goods, and it remained firmly at its original level, continuing to open at 61 and 2 yuan. There was a lack of glutinous and japonica domestic rice arrivals yesterday. Rumors of trading on the open and gray market, coinciding with the rebound in foreign rice, all turned bullish. Selling prices also increased by half a yuan. Chang Bang Qing japonica opened at 66 and a half yuan, 66 yuan. Wuxi Qing japonica opened at 65 and a half yuan, 65 yuan. Changzhou Su Kun japonica opened at 64 and a half yuan, followed by Su 61 yuan, Nangang original package early rice 62 and a half yuan, 61 and a half yuan, Hu Jian 60 yuan to 59 yuan, Jin Li Special Yuan 61 and a half yuan, 61 yuan, Chang Dan Bai Yuan 59 and a half yuan, 58 and a half yuan, Hong Kong Special Yuan 61 and a half yuan, 61 yuan, Medium 58 and a half yuan, 58 yuan, and Yuan 53 and 4 yuan.

### Flour and Wheat: Flat and Dull

Yesterday's spot market for flour was dull. Checking the prices of two flour mills, the price was 15 yuan. Fuxin and Fufeng can both place orders. It is heard that the Fuxin factory will resume operations as soon as the newly arrived foreign wheat starts to rise. In addition, the northern gang often has difficulties transporting flour, so people are inevitably discouraged. The market price of the Japanese factory's green phoenix flour is also therefore sluggish, with the market price for this month opening at 14 yuan, 3 jiao and 5 fen, September at 14 yuan, 7 jiao and 5 fen, and October at 14 yuan, 8 jiao and 5 fen. More than 3,000 bags were traded. Inland flour and foreign flour still saw few imports and exports, and the market was also mediocre.

The new wheat market was also not exciting. Checking nearby vehicles and ships, arrivals were not lonely, but the flat and soft flour prices meant that the factories inevitably focused on buying. It is also heard that a ship of foreign wheat ordered by the Fuxin factory arrived in Shanghai yesterday. It is rumored that this wheat was ordered by the Japanese factory, but this has not been confirmed. It can be determined by observing the Fuxin factory's opening and supply situation. Today's market price for high-quality wheat is 23 yuan, and the Japanese factory's purchase price is 21 yuan, 2 jiao and 3 fen, with 3,000 to 4,000 bags traded daily.

### Yarn and Cotton: Hand Goods are Being Sold Off; The Yarn Market is Difficult to View Optimistically

The yarn market is flat, and the situation remains in a revolving state. However, although actual sales have not seen wholesale development, the Hong Kong gang continues to make purchases in small quantities, so some people are still optimistic and dragging in goods. However, those holding goods generally believe that the current situation has an oversupply trend, and they are afraid that there will be no major increase in the long term, so they are selling off their hand goods in large quantities.

The spot yarn market opened this morning, and the situation in the market was still peaceful, with no major changes. The opening price for 20-count Variant Horse yarn was 910 yuan. Soon, a certain scalper household took in one or two hundred bags in the market, and the table felt slightly dry. Asking prices gradually tightened, gradually rising to 920 yuan. Once the high price was reached, it did not rise any further, and those who sailed with the wind sold off, resulting in a decline back to 915 yuan. The closing price was still slightly better. Checking the half-day transaction statistics, 2,280 bags were traded. The market price of 20-count Variant Horse yarn was not much different from the previous day. Today, 1,565 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong. The amount of purchases made by each gang is listed as follows:

Counterparts: 1,540 Xiamen: 110

Inland: 100 Hong Kong: 620

Total: 2,280

### New Cotton Gradually Enters the Market; This Year's Harvest is Good

The current cotton situation still lacks excitement. As for the overseas cotton market, it is also in a revolving state. New domestic cotton is gradually entering the market, and it is said that there is a good report on this year's harvest, so everyone is taking a wait-and-see attitude. The current cotton market remains bleak as ever.

In other news, the overseas cotton market price is firm and active in the New York cotton market. At the same time, due to the improvement in stock prices on Wall Street and the hedging of some funds, the closing price was 4-5 pound coins higher than the previous day. The Indian cotton market rose by one rupee along with the top forecast yesterday.

In the Shanghai cotton market, the sluggish yarn prices in recent days have affected cotton trading. Factory demand has also been quiet. Counterparts, due to the lack of spot goods on the market, are ordering cargo from foreign firms for shipment, but there have been no transactions for several months, and the current war risk rate is quite high, which is equivalent to a price of 56 yuan higher than the spot price.

### Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Spot Sales are Still Lively

The trend in the cloth market is stable. Spot sales rise and fall, but are still lively. Demand from the northern gang and the Nanyang gang has increased slightly. The opening prices of various goods are flat, with fluctuations of only 1 jiao to 2 jiao and a half. More than 600 pieces of coarse cloth, grey cloth, bleached cloth, and flannel are handled on this street. More than 100 pieces of heavy flannel, coarse cloth, and serge are handled by the Yantai gang on the northern road. 50 to 60 pieces of colored cloth and colored twill are handled by the Xi'an gang. Several hundred pieces of fine twill and colored cloth are handled by the Guangdong and Hong Kong gangs. More than 100 pieces of Shilin cloth and blue cloth are handled by the Sichuan and Yunnan gangs. More than 4,000 pieces of colored cloth, bleached cloth, straight tribute, and other goods are handled by the countries of Siam and other foreign countries.

Eastern cloth declined again yesterday, as the actual transaction volume was ordinary and the market was slightly soft. The opening price of 12-pound Dragon Head Fine Cloth in the morning was 31 yuan and 2 jiao, and the market price fell to 30 yuan and 9 jiao later. Four Gentlemen Serge was around 9 jiao and 1 fen. Mid-range fine cloth and fine twill were relatively firm, with minimal increases and decreases.

80 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong on the 21st, 815 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong on the 22nd, and 35 pieces were transferred to Singapore.

### Silk and Tea: The Position of Real Silk is Shaken

Overseas silk prices have fluctuated slightly recently, and the number of transactions on the exchange is also only three or four per day. It is heard that the sales of new artificial silk in the United States are quite astonishing, and the position of real silk is in danger of being shaken. Moreover, the level of silk prices and the strength of silk sales are still related to the subtle diplomatic relations between Japan and the United States. Silk trading in Shanghai is quite quiet. The British and French gangs have thin appetite and higher prices (the difference between white factories is 400 yuan). Japanese firms have also been inactive for a long time, but it is said that 150 dan of white factory Zhili were transacted yesterday.

### Feng Mei Pearl Tea is Gradually Starting Up

Yesterday, the tea market moved slightly. Uncolored Feng Mei pearl tea has seen a gradual start-up trend due to repeated sample mailings and promotional telegrams from merchants in recent days. Yesterday, Jinlong, Tongfu, Yihua, Xiehe and other firms imported a total of 180 boxes of green tea. Pearl tea was sold at prices ranging from 265 yuan to 190 yuan, and Feng Mei was sold at 220-230 yuan. Market prices are all trending towards stability. Black tea is also brewing. It is heard that German merchants have a large appetite, and many tea factories have started production to meet foreign sales.

### Sugar Market: Yi Sugar Continues to Rise; Dutch Red Opens at 5,000 Bags

Yesterday, the market for coarse white and Dutch red sugar continued to rise. The current goods of the association-designated market, 24 coarse white, were 73 and a half yuan for local warehouses, up 5 jiao. The foreign warehouses were 73 yuan in the morning and 73 yuan and 4 jiao in the afternoon, up 6 jiao. Old goods were 72 yuan and 8 jiao, and transit goods were 57 yuan and 7 jiao to 58 yuan, up half a yuan. Dutch cotton white KD mark was 72 yuan and 2 jiao, TML mark was 73 and a half yuan, up 5 jiao to 7 jiao. Dutch red spot goods were 63 yuan, up 1 yuan, and road goods were 62 yuan and 3 jiao. Swire Foreign Company opened 5,000 bags of Dutch red for immediate loading at a price of US$2.56, O.I.E. example. Swire's carriage white lower grades were tight, with the B mark at 74 yuan and 7 jiao, the DY mark at 71 yuan and 2 jiao, the HX mark at 70 yuan and 8 jiao, and the H mark carriage red at 61 yuan, up 1 yuan. For domestic sugar, the Jian gang opened 210 bags of top Dia Qing at 64 yuan. The Chao gang opened another 93 bags at 62 and a half yuan. Dongxiang red still rose, with slightly oily packages at 55 yuan, and the next grade at 54 yuan and 8 jiao, with a total of 200 bags traded, up about 2 yuan. 10,630 bags of sugar arrived from Hong Kong yesterday.

### Coal  White Coal Seemingly Tight, Secretly Loose

The white coal market, after its self-propelled price increase the previous week, ultimately suffered due to sluggish actual sales in the city. Stockpilers released large quantities, resulting in a situation of external strength but internal weakness, with an apparent tightness but underlying stability. Transactions among firms saw price discrepancies. While the listed price for Hongji white coal was 216 yuan, the black market offered discounts of 10 yuan, causing disorder among shops on this street and inconsistent prices.

### Newly Established Water Conservancy Bureau

Since Shanghai opened to foreign trade, sails and masts have crowded the Huangpu River. Fujian and Guangdong sand boats, and other vessels are moored and docked haphazardly in the river's center. Although the area south of the Sixteenth Bund Bridge is not related to foreign ships, it is a necessary route for official steamships traveling from Wusong to Gaochang Temple. When typhoons and tides rise, collisions are a constant worry. Furthermore, boatmen dumping mud and stones, and residents and shopkeepers discarding garbage into the Huangpu River cause great damage to the water conservancy. Previously, Liu, the Circuit Intendant of Songjiang, Suzhou and Taicang, appointed Zhang Hanqing, the judicial commissioner, and Wu, the sub-prefect of Songhai Defense, to survey the boundary from the Sixteenth Bund Bridge to the South Wharf, and to set up boundary markers to indicate the limitations of the wharf. Now, Zhang, the judicial commissioner, has again been instructed to establish the South Section Water Conservancy Bureau in conjunction with the county authorities. From the Sixteenth Bund Bridge to Longhua, four Western-style fir plank patrol boats have been stationed, with officers and patrolmen patrolling day and night, specifically managing the boundary markers along the riverbank, guiding Fujian and Guangdong sandboats to berth in separate groups, and inspecting the dumping of mud and stones, and the construction of wharves along the river. Furthermore, personnel familiar with water conservancy will be dispatched to measure sections at any time. If there are any silting or shallow areas that hinder navigation, poles will be erected to indicate the course to avoid. In the event of matters involving the New Customs Marine Office, harmonious consultation is still required. A general bureau has been established in a rented house located in the South End of the Jianghai Customs, in the Dongting Mountain Wharf Lane, west of the Ankang Villa and separated by a wall.

### Ideals and Reality

By Wang Da

Reality is the concrete fact in the universe that cannot be denied. Its scope is extremely broad, from the existence of a nation or a society to the growth of a grass or a tree, as well as various things closely related to our daily lives, all of which are included. Ideals are an internal psychological activity that always surpasses concrete facts; however, it is different from fantasy or delusion, because it is created by our intellect and judged by correct rationality. Simply put, reality is the real environment around us, and psychology is the possible imagination of our mind.

Since reality surrounds us, its influence on us is obviously huge and irresistible. Inherited customs, man-made laws, and social moral standards are constantly exerting pressure on us. Whether it is beneficial or harmful to us, we must deal with it. Therefore, dealing with the current reality has become the first priority in everyone's life.

However, if the real environment is too harsh and the troubles it causes increase day by day, then people will involuntarily generate various desires and ideals based on their own preferences. When the time is right, they will resolutely rise up to resist the environment and use their own intelligence to transform an environment that meets their ideals. Therefore, sometimes we can even say that today's ideals often become tomorrow's reality. Such examples are not difficult to find in the history of civilization. For example, democratic politics in the era of tyrannical autocracy was just an ideal in its infancy; similarly, in the field of science, the fact that airplanes can fly today is precisely the ideal that people held when they saw kites soaring in the sky in the past.

From this point of view, ideals and reality can be said to be two good companions on the journey of human evolution, which are parallel and indispensable. Based on reality, ideals are generated, and then ideals evolve into facts. This cycle of endless recurrence is the driving force for advancing cultural history. However, in the vast sea of ​​people, there are often many people who deliberately make biased remarks, either emphasizing reality while belittling ideals, or suppressing ideals while admiring reality. This is really an unwise move. Generally speaking, focusing too much on reality easily leads to vulgarity and baseness. People who suffer from this disease only know how to live in peace and survive, accept whatever comes their way, and succumb to the real environment. They rush to where there is profit, forget righteousness for small gains, and are indifferent to human life. Conversely, people who are too immersed in ideals are only immersed in the beautiful realm of ideals, and the distance from reality becomes increasingly distant. They boast that they are different from the common people. Little do they know that once the beautiful dream ends and life forces them to face reality, they will inevitably find it difficult to cope due to the long-term separation. Wandering on such a wrong path will eventually lead to realizing that they have made no contribution to human civilization, and turn into despair, becoming increasingly pessimistic and unable to extricate themselves.

Therefore, the right outlook on life is first of all to recognize reality, grasp reality, and then, inspired by one's own mind, always embrace a correct, error-free, and achievable ideal, with the goal of improving human civilization and welfare, and moving forward on the road of life. In this way, the individual can be considered to have contributed his efforts to the whole within his own boundaries. Now is the eve of the impending decline of human civilization. The young people of the times should be alert, recognize their own tasks, quickly recognize reality, determine their ideals, bravely accept the challenges of the bad environment, and make a desperate struggle for their ideals!

Family

### Father

By Yu Yu

The body, which has been working for a day, is often soaked in salty sweat. Whenever the sun sinks into the sea and a breeze blows through the clothes, everyone must think of taking a bath and moving a rattan chair to sit in the breeze. If you meet an old man who loves to talk and laugh, you can tell stories about ancient and modern times to the neighbors on the left and right, sighing that the present is not as good as the past, and that one year is not as good as another. Young people will listen attentively with loving and respectful faces, and from time to time ask some surprising questions. Such as: "Did rice sell for four yuan a dan at that time? It's really cheap!" "Grandpa, was there a tram at that time?"

If someone doesn't like these old stories, they can sit alone in a relatively sheltered place, lightly waving a cattail leaf fan, recalling something, thinking about something, which is also very pleasant. At that time, no one would notice that there was another person living in silence.

Recently, friends have seen me and said that I have changed, and I myself feel a little different from before. Since my father passed away this spring, my youthful and active personality has also been buried with my father. I would rather sit alone in melancholy, no longer sitting quietly by and listening when people talk about old stories like before. This may be because I can no longer find my father's voice on summer evenings!

Since I was a child, I slept in the same bed with my father until I lived in school. I remember that every night, whether it was winter or summer, I always loved to listen to my father tell stories. Later, I got tired of hearing my father's stories, so I turned to asking about things from the past. My father often told me about his past struggles, how he borrowed twelve yuan from home to go to Nanjing to study; how he went to Zhangjiakou on a mule cart for a living at the age of twenty, and so on, often mixed with words of encouragement to me: "Look, look, I used to eat radish and rice every day in school. It's really incomparable to now. You have to study hard!"

Last summer, my father may have felt that he was old and would not live long, and feared that his life's experiences would be forgotten, so he said more than usual. Often, one thing was said over and over again, and I seemed to listen patiently, sometimes deliberately asking him questions that I knew very well. Whenever the time was too late, he always said in his old voice: "I have too many experiences in my life. I can't finish talking about them in a few months. I really want to write a book when it's cooler. Alas, I really have to write a book."

The weather has cooled down, and it has gone from cool to hot again. The book about my father's life experiences was never written. My father's old voice can never be heard again, and even my father's shadow will soon be slightly forgotten by familiar people.

Recently, friends have said that I have changed. Yes, I have changed, and my environment has also changed. The idle talks during the cool of the evening no longer arouse my interest. I would rather sit alone in a sheltered place, thinking and recalling, because my father's voice can no longer reach me anywhere.

Hawthorne Case

### The Dancer's Ending

By Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter 5 Bad News

Ni Jinshou reluctantly sat down on the sofa next to the desk and automatically reported his experiences. The loyal old servant Shi Gui also listened attentively near the door.

He said: "Just now Mr. Hawthorne called me. I happened to be back at the office, so I told him about my investigation into Yu Gantang and Lu Jiansheng's whereabouts last night. Then I asked him about his experiences, and he also told me that Zhao Boxiong lived at 774, 7th floor of the Asia Hotel, but had already moved out. He also told me that at that time, he accidentally saw Yu Gantang, and you had gone upstairs with him. I was just about to discuss a meeting place with him and prepare how to proceed, and wanted to ask him to catch Yu Gantang immediately when suddenly there was a bang in the telephone receiver, like a piece of glass breaking. After that, there was no sound from him. Then there was a buzzing sound, like some kind of disturbance. I knew something must have gone wrong."

I waited for him to pause and continued to ask: "After that, you rushed to the Asia Hotel, didn't you?"

Ni Jinshou nodded and said: "Yes, but unfortunately, my car kept running into red lights, which delayed me a lot. When I arrived at the hotel, apart from a piece of the glass door of the telephone booth being broken, there was nothing unusual. Even the broken glass on the ground had been swept away."

"Didn't you see Hawthorne?"

"No, the telephone booth was empty, and there was no one outside the door."

I thought to myself that there were four or five people at the door of the telephone booth when I went down the elevator. Ni Jinshou probably arrived at the Asia Hotel after I left. I didn't think of this at all at the time, so I didn't see the broken glass on the door of the telephone booth either.

I also said: "Of course you had to ask the hotel staff."

Ni Jinshou replied: "Yes, the hotel staff didn't recognize Hawthorne. They only said that a man with a gray thin wool coat and a navy blue suit was shot by someone while making a phone call. The murderer escaped on the spot, and they didn't see what he looked like either. The shot man immediately fell to the ground, but got up in a while, pressed his cheek with a white handkerchief, and walked out. They wanted to send him to the hospital, but the man didn't agree and walked out on his own. They naturally held the principle of 'the less trouble, the better,' and didn't even report it to the court. I thought that the shot man must be Mr. Hawthorne without a doubt." (83)

### Tracing the Footsteps of Greta Garbo

— Qinghui

After fifteen years of competition, Garbo still stands unchanged in Hollywood. Although approaching middle age, inevitably with the beauty of her youth fading, she remains extremely popular. No competitor can contend with her. Is this merely a coincidence?

Before Garbo came to Hollywood, almost no one in Sweden knew her. Only after she met the great director Stiller did she embark on a path of great prospects. He brought her to Hollywood and introduced her to MGM Studios. The contract stipulated a weekly salary of four hundred dollars in the first year, six hundred dollars in the second, and seven hundred and fifty dollars in the third.

Initially, no one paid attention to this foreign daughter. But after the film "The Torrent," audiences worldwide were shaken; they discovered a unique soul in the film industry. At that time, she had no interest in Hollywood, especially as Stiller had failed because he could not understand the American character and psychology, further disappointing her. She almost returned to her homeland with her benefactor, if not for Stiller's earnest persuasion.

Later, she met John Gilbert, one who sympathized with her somewhat. They collaborated on several films, and their daily closeness changed her outlook on life significantly.

As she gradually achieved success, many bad tidings came from Sweden! Her beloved sister died, and her benefactor Stiller died. Courageously, she worked while weeping. However, her poor state of mind forced her to distance herself from the public. "Mysterious Woman" became the nickname generally given to her at this time.

From silent films to talkies, her fame did not diminish at all; on the contrary, it became even more active. She successively starred in many famous films, such as "Mata Hari," "Romance," "Camille," and "Grand Hotel." After "Two-Faced Woman" was filmed, she returned to Sweden for a trip. Upon returning from visiting her hometown, she co-starred with Robert Taylor in "Camille," with Charles Boyer in "Conquest," and with Melvyn Douglas in "Ninotchka." Her most recent new work is the biography of "Madame Curie." Spencer Tracy was Garbo's designated leading actor. It is said that in this film, she not only smiles, but also sings.

### A Surprising New Force

— Plum Blossom Pavilion Master

Shen Manhua and Wang Hongfu Replace Tan on Stage

Tan Fuying and Chen Lifang's troupe finished their contract yesterday. The management approved the replacement of them with Shen Manhua and Wang Hongfu. The contract is for one month, after which Wu Suqiu and Chi Shigong will continue to perform. Currently, Manhua is in Shanghai, and Hongfu arrived in the South on the 20th by ship from Qingdao. As soon as Wang arrives in Shanghai, performances can begin. The dramatic arts of Shen and Wang are briefly recorded below:

Shen is from Yushan, Suzhou. She has lived in the old capital since childhood. With a love for Peking opera, she was able to perform on stage in colorful costumes at a young age. She initially studied Qingyi roles, later also learning Huashan roles. Mei Lanfang, hearing her sing, deemed her promising and accepted her as a disciple. After being mentored by Mei, Manhua's desire to learn became even more fervent, and Mei was happy to guide her. She performed in the old capital for several years, earning a reputation above Wei Lianfang, Lin Qiuwen, and Zhu Qinxin. Her voice is clear, bright, and sweet, almost indistinguishable from Mei's. In addition to excelling in Dan roles, Manhua's Xiaosheng roles are also among her specialties, such as "White Gate Tower," "Shooting the Halberd at Yuanmen," "Flying Tiger Mountain," "Commanding Wine," and "Visiting the Village in Yuejia Village," which are all performed vividly and colorfully, showing that she has learned from a good lineage (Manhua is also a proud disciple of Jiang Miaoxiang), offering a unique experience. At this time of generational transition at the Updated Theater, the collaboration between Shen Manhua and Wang Hongfu is organized, with the renowned Xiaosheng Jiang Miaoxiang assisting them, truly a surprising new force. Wang Hongfu, a Sheng actor, also known as Xiao Baofen, is quite famous in the Qingdao-Jinan area. He once performed in Shanghai and took on leading roles. I have not seen Hongfu's art, but according to the renowned amateur opera enthusiasts Luo Quyuan and Wang Dabang, Hongfu's skills are unmatched by anyone in the Peking opera circle.

### Thoughts on "The Wilderness"

— A Han

Generally speaking, "The Wilderness" is not as tightly structured as "Thunderstorm," nor as tragic as "Sunrise." However, in comprehensive evaluation, the intentions, diction, and all the reflections of "The Wilderness" surpass both "Thunderstorm" and "Sunrise." This is because it exposes the darkness of the feudal forces of the old society, burying the previous generation and burying the current generation. However, the later generations should fight against the dark environment, even the social system, and create the light of humanity!

Looking back at today's society, although it is no longer the era when "The Wilderness" was published, the life of Chou Hu is still growing and declining among the young community, and many are sacrificed and buried under a somewhat "trumped-up" charge. In the play, Chou Hu avenged his grievances and hatred, and acted boldly without any emotional impulse. Even in the end, he used his own knife as the destination of his life. This, Chou Hu suggests: For the sake of future generations, people of the previous generations should liberate themselves from shackles.

Huang River's personality is always a tough guy of the times. He has reason, he has emotions, therefore: when acting, he also uses his personality to develop the character in the play. Therefore, the leading role of Chou Hu is matched in terms of personality acting. Sun Jinglu's age is very young, but she has already grasped many aspects of style. Her Jinzi completely covers up the demeanor of Cui Xi in "Sunrise" and Sifeng in "Thunderstorm," and presents a typical performance in the form of a rural woman with romantic vigor. Therefore, it has also won excellent results. Zhang Xuemei's Jiao's mother is violent, Wu Jingping's Daxie is cowardly, Ge Xin's fool is stupid, and Chang Yu of Chouhu is innocent. All the characters are personified, intertwined on the eve of the collapse of the old society, and the transmission of acting skills is moving. In terms of scenery and sound, the configuration of the "Wilderness" performance is successful.
