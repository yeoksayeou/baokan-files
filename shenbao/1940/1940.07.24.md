Editorial

### After Britain Refuses to Ceasefire and Make Peace

The international situation centered on Britain and Germany is not a simple matter of right and wrong; nor is there a simple and definite philosophy that can be used as a yardstick for criticizing the overall situation. Criticism is useless. Please analyze the cause and effect of each step of the facts.

The most recent new fact is that the German leader, Mr. Hitler, expressed his intention to cease fire and make peace to Britain in his parliament four days ago. Everyone is watching how Britain will react. Will it accept this proposal? However, the British Foreign Secretary, Mr. Halifax, gave a speech in his House of Lords the day before yesterday and rejected it with a "No!" Although the German side did not regard Mr. Halifax's speech as a definite answer, saying that it must wait for the British Prime Minister, Mr. Churchill, to announce it in the House of Commons today to be considered an official response; although there is a difference in the positions of the Foreign Secretary and the Prime Minister; although the speeches of the two in the House of Lords and the House of Commons have different weights; although time brews endless functions and wonderful uses; however, we absolutely cannot imagine that what Mr. Churchill will announce will be completely different from Mr. Halifax's and will not reject Mr. Hitler's proposal with a "No." For the sake of our "greater self," we cannot help but have a selfish thought and sincerely hope that the European situation will achieve an early ceasefire and make peace; however, in the most recent new fact, we do not need to wait for Mr. Churchill's statement. We know for sure that Britain will never hesitate on the fork in the road of war and peace and is determined to continue fighting Germany independently. We reserve our criticism of the overall situation, but we cannot but praise the strong and great British spirit and praise the loyal, brave, and robust British subjects!

Britain has decisively rejected the fork in the road, held its head high, and stepped onto the road of struggle. On that road, let's try to look into the distance.

Britain must regard the United States as its ideal partner, and it is also very reasonable! However, there are many obstacles to overcome in order to realize the ideal. There are two basic obstacles. First, many people in the United States have always regarded themselves as third parties in the general international situation; whether it is the European war or the Asian war, when taking any action, they only feel that they are helping others. Second, although Britain's rights and interests are all over the world, Britain is the most important country in Asia other than Asian countries; although the current situation in Europe is the inevitable result of the tolerance of Asian tyranny by the disciples of the British Simon eight or nine years ago; although the victory or defeat of the Asian war will directly affect the safety of Britain's national foundation and the gain or loss of rights and interests; however, many people in Britain have always regarded the European and Asian wars separately. We only look into the distance on Britain's road of struggle, and these two points are undoubtedly the demons on Britain's road. We are unwilling to say with a very narrow mind that the attitude of many people in the United States towards Europe is a clear lesson for the attitude of many people in Britain towards Asia, because "retribution is not missed"; we are willing to examine this kind of demon. In terms of the first point: if Britain is defeated, the United States will immediately feel the serious impact. This is the simplest common sense, and anyone knows it clearly. Even on the American side, if you look at the writings of far-sighted people in the United States in recent years, you can also see the relationship clearly. What they say is more objective and more straightforward than any foreigner's opinion on the United States. However, one is because Americans, who have always lived under the concentration of wealth in the world, cannot help but have a delusion about the role of their own economic power in their intuition; thinking that gold is enough to command everything in the world, they are calm and leisurely in all aspects of international affairs. Second, when participating in the European war last time, they felt that the purpose was noble, and they were full of hope to "stop war with war" and lay the foundation for world peace forever; in the end, they found that what the United States sacrificed only maintained the interests of Britain and France, and the American ideal was not achieved at all. These two reasons combined have gradually formed the attitude that many Americans currently take towards the European situation; they are only happy to help Britain and France on a priori basis. Now Britain is determined to move forward on the road of struggle, but can it control the demon? Can it change the minds of the Americans and become partners? Let's wait for the facts to explain!

In terms of the second point; there has always been an undue division in Britain's Far East policy, between America or the Soviet Union, that is, in several views of both the U.S. and Soviet Union it is generally thought that European and Asian events should be seen as related, while Britain often thinks that separate viewing is the most infinite use based on its British-style wisdom. In the past, this British wisdom has brought great evils to Britain and the world; that is, the initial failure of the British-Soviet negotiations last year was actually one of the hidden reasons for this; and the two decisions on the "Tokyo Agreement" last year and this year were also caused by this kind of wisdom. Recently, on the one hand, it expressed its firm determination to fight in Europe, but on the other hand, it accepted the request to block the滇缅 transportation for three months. This is only some British people who inherited British-style wisdom think it is correct and wonderful, and are embarrassed to defend themselves. In fact, Britain continues to fight and wants to call on the international community to be its partner, and its arguments will inevitably be discounted as a result, that is, it will add to the demons on its own road of struggle. Fortunately, as long as it can withstand the German offensive, then these three months, Britain will have an excellent opportunity to re-examine itself.

### Japanese Planes Attack Hechuan and Qijiang, More Than a Thousand Chinese Are Killed or Injured, the National Relief Commission Sends People with Money to Provide Relief

Chongqing: The Air Defense Command has just declared that after two Japanese reconnaissance planes were shot down by Chinese planes yesterday, Japanese planes immediately bombed Hechuan, 30 miles north of Chongqing, and Qijiang, 50 miles south of Chongqing. More than a thousand Chinese were killed or injured in the two places. This Japanese air raid was obviously a retaliatory measure for the two Japanese planes being shot down. The National Relief Commission has sent representatives with money to the two places to provide relief. (Dispatch of the 23rd by the United Press)

Chongqing: Yesterday, most people here witnessed two Japanese reconnaissance planes being shot down by Chinese fighter planes. It is reported that the official estimate is that each of the two Japanese planes shot down was worth 100,000 yuan. According to the Chinese Air Defense Bureau, the two Japanese planes flew in yesterday morning and were shot down by Chinese planes as soon as they reached the airspace over Chongqing. Both planes fell near the center of the city. The two Japanese planes were probably to indicate the target for the later bombers. At first, they flew very high, and the Chinese fighter planes could not attack them for a while. It was not until the two planes flew low below the clouds that the Chinese fighter planes took the opportunity to shoot them down. According to reports reaching here, three teams of Japanese bombers had left Hankou, but they did not reach Chongqing, apparently because the weather was gloomy and the inspection was not clear. However, it was heard that the Japanese bombers had bombed Hechuan southwest of Chongqing and Qijiang south of Chongqing. (Dispatch of the 23rd by the United Press)

Chongqing: After a week without being bombed by Japanese planes, yesterday a Japanese reconnaissance plane suddenly circled over General Chiang Kai-shek's private residence. According to Chinese reports, the plane has been shot down by Chinese fighter planes. (Dispatch of the 23rd by Haitong News Agency)

### China Should Form an Alliance with the United States and the Soviet Union - Lin Yutang's Opinion

Chongqing: Mr. Lin Yutang, a well-known Chinese writer who recently returned to China, recently wrote an article in Ta Kung Pao, advocating that China should form an alliance with both the United States and the Soviet Union at the same time, saying that this is the only solution to China's diplomatic relations. Mr. Lin said that in the future, the Pacific situation must be that Japan is on one side, and the United States, China, and the Soviet Union are on the other side, opposing each other. From the same standpoint of helping China, the United States and the Soviet Union will never oppose each other, so it is not impossible for China to form an alliance with the United States and the Soviet Union at the same time. From the geographical situation, past friendship, and future transportation, the Soviet Union is the closest friend of China among all friendly countries. The most reasonable diplomatic policy for China today is to form an alliance with both the United States and the Soviet Union at the same time. Americans generally hope that China will defeat Japan. Americans are very happy to hear the news that Chinese soldiers are working hard to defeat Japan. Therefore, the United States naturally thinks it is a matter of course that China hopes to get more assistance. The United States and the Soviet Union have now become important determinants in solving the Pacific problem. Even if Germany wins, it will have to respect the views of the Soviet Union in the Far East. China's war of resistance is half for the interests of the United States and the Soviet Union. The United States and the Soviet Union should not hesitate to do their best to help China. (Dispatch of the 23rd by the United Press)

### U.S. Secretary of State Hull Announces Pan-American System is Purely Self-Defense, Distinct from Aggressor Policies of Europe and Asia, Recommends Economic Alliance to the Assembly, Advocates Joint Management of Dutch and Belgian Territories in the Western Hemisphere

Havana, Cuba - U.S. Secretary of State Hull declared at the Pan-American Conference that the purpose of this meeting is to deliberate on plans to cope with the current urgent issues. The tragedies suffered by a large part of the world make us more aware that the Americas are also in danger. To fail to recognize this danger in time and prepare to resolutely deal with it would be tantamount to suicide.

Hull mentioned the proposal to establish a joint trusteeship for the territories in the Western Hemisphere belonging to European-occupied countries, saying: "We do not seek to absorb these territories or expand our sovereignty, nor do we wish to place these lands within any sphere of influence. However, we cannot allow these lands to become bargaining chips in the resolution of European disputes, or battlegrounds for adjusting such disputes. Either of these occurrences would be seen as a threat to the peace and security of the Western Hemisphere, as it would indicate the potential use of these lands to promote systems incompatible with the Pan-American system. Therefore, any attempt to modify the status quo of this region, whether through cession, transfer, or impairment of the current governance, will be a matter of deep and urgent concern for the American republics. Therefore, today, we must jointly discuss this common problem. We must position ourselves to act swiftly and without hesitation." Hull announced that the U.S. government supports the joint trusteeship proposal, and said that the U.S. government is prepared to cooperate with other republics to implement this proposal when the opportunity arises. He also said that the establishment of a joint trusteeship in any place must not be accompanied by the thought that any American republic has a special interest in that place. The purpose of the joint trusteeship must be to enhance the interests and security of the American nations and the interests of the local area. Furthermore, as soon as the situation permits, the land should be restored to its original sovereignty, or its independence should be declared when it can establish and maintain a stable autonomous government. Hull mentioned the threats felt by the American nations, saying that there are activities originating outside the Western Hemisphere but directed within the borders of the Americas. This is an attempt by foreign governments to seize control of the American republics for their own benefit. We must be aware of the intentions of these evil schemes. The governmental structure has been undermined by foreign propaganda, and there are precedents in other countries for us to learn from. We have long known the source and extent of these evil schemes, so we should urgently adopt remedial measures to safeguard the independence and political integrity of each American republic. All friendly nations cannot object to our preventive measures, because the Pan-American system contains no implication of aggression or threat to any country.

The Pan-American system relies purely on a policy of self-defense. Members of the Pan-American community do not seek to establish hegemonic power, nor do they want others to extend their hegemony. The Pan-American system is also different from the regional policies recently adopted elsewhere in the world. Some places in the world have cited the Pan-American system as a precedent for their regional policies. However, it must be known that the sole purpose of the Pan-American system is self-defense, while regional policies are not for self-defense but seek to conquer free and independent people by force, military occupation, and economic and political control. The American republics must not ignore the possibility of attacks directed from the outside and originating from within.

Hull also said that the most pressing situation currently faced by the American republics is the result of the stagnation or change in the nature of foreign major commercial markets. He will now propose an immediate cooperative procedure, with four points: (1) Strengthen and expand the activities of the Pan-American Financial and Economic Advisory Committee; (2) Facilitate the temporary handling and sale of surplus goods; (3) Develop commodity agreements to guarantee equal trading conditions for both production and sales; (4) Consider ways to improve the living standards of the people of Latin American countries. In trade matters, we should study a broader system of Pan-American cooperation to achieve cooperation in long-term economic development and foreign exchange. If the American nations help each other and implement the measures decided by the conference with courage, determination, and faithfulness, they can create an economic defense system and avoid the dangers of foreign economic control and domestic economic difficulties. We never want to hinder trade with Europe or elsewhere, but we want to increase trade with countries that treat us with good faith and peaceful friendship. Otherwise, we will only defend ourselves. (Reuters, 22nd)

Washington - Far Eastern experts here studied Secretary of State Hull's speech at the Havana Pan-American Conference last night. Their interpretation is that it is a new rebuttal to Japan's declaration of hegemony over Asia. Hull's speech carefully clarified the United States' policy in the Western Hemisphere and made a significant distinction between this policy and Japan's so-called "Far Eastern Monroe Doctrine." The purpose of this speech is clearly to dispel the confusion caused by President Roosevelt's statement two weeks ago, through his secretary, O'Laughlin, that he agreed to allow Japan to adopt the "Monroe Doctrine" in the Far East.

### President Roosevelt Submits Proposal to Congress, Requests Increase in Loans for Export-Import Bank to Purchase Surplus Products from South America

Washington - President Roosevelt recently proposed to Congress to increase the lending power of the Export-Import Bank by $500 million so that the bank can help handle the surplus commodities of Latin American countries. President Roosevelt also proposed that the restrictions on the bank's lending power should be lifted. It is generally expected that this move by the President will greatly contribute to the progress of the Pan-American Conference in Havana. It is widely believed that this is another step in establishing a Pan-American mechanism to handle the surplus products of certain countries in the Americas so that the omnipotent country cannot achieve its goals in South America (Reuters, 23rd)

### Cuban Foreign Minister Elected Chairman of the Assembly, and Five Committees Appointed

Havana, Cuba - Cuban Acting Foreign Minister Komba has been elected Chairman of the Pan-American Conference, and the delegates warmly welcomed U.S. Secretary of State Hull's speech. (Reuters, 23rd)

Havana - The people of Havana do not seem to pay much attention to the actions of the foreign ministers of the American countries at the Pan-American Conference. The failure of Germany, Italy, Spain, and Japan to send diplomatic representatives to observe has attracted the attention of some people. This conference appointed five committees to be responsible for investigating voting credentials, drafting the conference agenda, studying neutrality issues, examining peace issues, and studying economic issues. The United States has great influence over the appointment of committee members. Therefore, the countries selected as committee members are mostly in tune with the United States and have no conflicting interests. What is most thought-provoking is that the three major countries in South America (Argentina, Brazil, and Chile) did not get a seat on the Economic Committee, because these countries value their trade with Europe and do not agree with Roosevelt's plan to create a Pan-American economic alliance.

### France Dispatches Hudan to Visit South America to Negotiate French Territory Issues

Vichy - According to sources in diplomatic circles here, former French Cabinet Assistant Hudan will visit South America to negotiate the issue of French territories in Central and South America. They pointed out that the French government is quite concerned about the United States and the Pan-American Conference's use of the Monroe Doctrine to restrict European countries' territories in the Americas. Hudan's visit is aimed at dealing with this trend, and at the same time, he will study France's export trade to Central and South America. Britain and France are trying to exclude German and French trade with South America. Diplomatic circles believe that Hudan does not have the power to sign agreements, and his visit is of an informal nature. However, the information Hudan obtains will make a great contribution to the entire European economic structure. (Haitong News Agency, 22nd)

### Prime Minister and Army Minister Issue Statements

Tokyo - The new Prime Minister Konoe received reporters from various newspapers at his official residence at 3:30 PM today to discuss domestic and foreign politics, such as establishing a new political structure, strengthening national defense, and adjusting relations with Germany, Italy, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Konoe said that strengthening national defense will receive his first attention. The total resources of the country will be adjusted and concentrated on this great purpose. Foreign policy will be refreshed. The whole country will need to endure some hardships under national defense, but Konoe promised to guarantee the minimum living standards. A reporter raised the question of how Japan would reconcile its relations with Germany and Italy with its relations with Britain and the United States, and asked Konoe to give a straightforward answer. Konoe replied that this issue involves negotiations with the Imperial Headquarters and consultations with various cabinet members, so it can be announced in the near future. Another reporter asked about the basic policy towards the South, and Konoe only replied that he had given serious attention to this matter. Konoe also said that his remarks in 1938 regarding the resolution of the "China Incident" remain unchanged. The government's policy of assisting the Chinese "new regime" and overthrowing the Chongqing government will also remain unchanged from what was implemented by the previous administration. Finally, a reporter asked him to comment on the proposed large-scale adjustment of Japanese-Soviet relations. Konoe replied that it is necessary to adjust relations with all countries, but he refused to make any comments on adjusting relations with the Soviet Union, the United States, the South Sea region, Germany, Italy, and other countries. Konoe promised to consult with the Supreme Command before issuing a statement. (Reuters, 23rd)

To achieve this goal, Japan's national defense should be strengthened, and at the same time, it should break away from its dependence on Britain and the United States and strengthen its relations with the German-Italian axis.

### Chongqing Sources Comment on Japanese Political Situation

Chongqing - After the establishment of the new Konoe Cabinet in Japan, a Central News Agency reporter visited an observer and asked about the character and trends of the new Konoe Cabinet. The gentleman recounted the causes and effects to the reporter, and his analysis of the new cabinet was quite interesting. Excerpts are as follows: Konoe is known as being indifferent to fame and wealth, but in fact, his desire for political power is no less than that of his contemporaries. This time, his involvement in the new party movement aims at seizing political power, especially under the name of (establishing a new political system), and therefore friction occurred with Yonai. Konoe's eagerness to try was revealed as early as the summer of this year when he recommended his confidant Kido Koichi as Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal. When he decided to resign as President of the Privy Council, he recommended Hiranuma Kiichiro to succeed him, but he was rejected by Yonai. Konoe wants to fill the palace with party members, and then he can do whatever he wants. His efforts are only seen after Ito Hirobumi and Yamagata Aritomo. This time, he came out to form a cabinet before the new party was established. From a third-party perspective, it may not be too early, but Konoe's goal is political power, and the political party is just a means to seize political power. There is no difference from Konoe's perspective. It took six days to form this cabinet, which was quite unexpected. It is feared that the struggle to seize cabinet seats was quite fierce, so he had to be cautious and consider it carefully. Judging from the cabinet members announced today, except for Matsuoka Yosuke and Kobayashi Ichizo, there is really no one who can be called a politician. People like Yasui Eiji, Kawada Akira, and Hoshino Naoki are all skilled bureaucrats. They are more than capable of handling affairs, but not enough to make political decisions. Why did Konoe adopt the principle of small people this time? This seems to be because he learned from the failure of the previous principle of big people, and he had to retreat and make it easier to control as the first priority. This is like giving up eating because of choking. Konoe still reserves three ministerial positions to place party members after the new party is established, but these three vacancies are all idle positions. Even if the new party is established, whether the party members will accept it is still a question. Recently, such as the Kuhara and Nakajima factions of the Seiyukai party, and the Aso faction of the Social Democratic Party, have all announced their dissolution and are waiting to join the new party, while Machida Chuji of the Minseito party, in his capacity as party leader, stated that if the new party's political program is consistent with that of the Minseito party, then the party will not hesitate to support it. There is no mention of dissolving the party to join, which shows that it is in fact against the new party. Even if some of its members participate, the Minseito party itself may still not dissolve. This is a major obstacle to the establishment of a new party. Moreover, the established party politicians who originally rushed to Konoe's banner all had the sole purpose of approaching political power. Now that Konoe has formed a cabinet, and his cabinet members are distributed in this way, it will surely dishearten those who come. Therefore, whether the new party can be established has become a problem. What will be the foreign policy of the new Konoe Cabinet? This point is very important. According to our observation, the fundamental policy will probably not change much. The so-called strengthening of relations with the German-Italian axis will be decided by the intentions of the United States and Germany. At present, Germany does not seem to attach much importance to Japan's position, and it is even less willing for it to develop towards the South Seas. The United States has assumed the role of guardian of the Pacific and cannot sit idly by and watch it act recklessly. Matsuoka Yosuke's appointment as Foreign Minister is most noteworthy. This time, Konoe's content, the influence of Ikeda Seihin is the smallest, which is also closely related to the cooperation between the new cabinet and financial capitalists. It may not be able to last long because of this, and it is not known. In short, the new Konoe Cabinet is very mediocre, and those who have expectations for Konoe in the country will be greatly disappointed. (22nd Dispatch)

### Japan's Invasion of China Reaches End of Its Rope, Observations from Soviet Newspaper

Chongqing - Moscow reports that Professor Bol Shunyov recently published a long article in the government-run "News" newspaper, titled "Three Years of Chinese Resistance." The article briefly stated that the Yonai Cabinet resigned a few days after the third anniversary of the war against China, and the newly established Konoe Cabinet is the fifth cabinet to resolve the China Incident. According to three years ago, when the Sino-Japanese war broke out, Konoe was the Prime Minister. Now Konoe is back to end the "China Incident" as his own responsibility. In the past two or three months, Japan's need to end the Sino-Japanese war has been more urgent than ever before. First, due to the changes in the European situation, Japan believes that the current situation is the best opportunity to implement the Southern Advance and develop towards the southwest Pacific. Second, the severity of the domestic situation in Japan. In addition to other difficulties, Japan is now encountering the most serious rice shortage. This panic is felt not only in Japan and Korea, but also in Manchuria and the Japanese-occupied areas in China. Taking Shanghai as an example, riots have recently occurred. Secondly, in the past few years, the Japanese authorities have tried to improve their financial and economic position, but the results have been minimal. The lack of raw materials has increased day by day, the cash reserves of Japanese banks have gradually decreased, and various exorbitant taxes have emerged one after another to exploit the civilians. At the same time, prices have soared and wages have been reduced by 50%. These are the major domestic and foreign difficulties encountered by the Japanese Yonai Cabinet. The Yonai Cabinet not only failed to solve the above-mentioned difficulties, but also failed to alleviate them. Today, this responsibility has been transferred to the Konoe Cabinet, which is what the Japanese ruling class expects from the new cabinet. (22nd Dispatch)

The Latvian Parliament also unanimously passed the land declaration this morning, declaring that all land belongs to the people, in other words, the land has been nationalized. All farmers with small amounts of cultivated land can obtain state-owned land. All acts that infringe on farmers' personal property and force farmers to organize collective farms will be severely punished according to the crime of endangering the interests of the people and the state. The declaration also firmly opposes all actions that use state land for private gain. At the afternoon meeting, after listening to the report from the Minister of Finance, Commerce, and Industry, the Parliament unanimously passed the declaration that banks and major industries should be nationalized. (Tass, 23rd)

Berlin - A German news agency report from Riga stated that the Latvian Parliament, which had just been incorporated into the Soviet Union, recently resolved that all land in the country should be nationalized.

The Parliament unanimously passed the land declaration, declaring that all land belongs to the people, in other words, the land has been nationalized and will be used by farmers forever.

### Residents of Riga Rush to Buy Goods

Riga - After the Latvian Parliament decided to join the Soviet Union, the commercial areas were crowded with customers last night, rushing to buy various goods. Shops have either sold out all their goods or have temporarily closed.

(Haitong News Agency, 23rd)

### Lithuanian Sports Delegation Arrives in Moscow

Moscow - The sports delegations of Lithuania and Latvia arrived here on the 20th. The Lithuanian delegation congratulated the Soviet sports personnel, saying, "Under the rule of former President Smetona, we regarded the Soviet Union as a forbidden zone.

Our country must follow the path of the great Soviet Union and move forward." (Tass, 22nd)

### News of Soviet Demands on Romania: To Organize a People's Government; Romania's Difficult Position; Romanian and Bulgarian Prime Ministers to Visit Berlin

Switzerland - It is rumored that the Soviet Union has already demanded that Romania "organize a People's Government." However, official sources here have not been able to confirm this. Political circles generally believe that the Soviet government hopes a well-known anti-German figure will assume power in Romania. If the above-mentioned demands are true, they will inevitably conflict with German interests. Germany will find such Soviet policies difficult to tolerate. As for Romania, while Hungary is demanding Outer Transylvania, it would not dare to do anything to provoke Germany's anger. In short, Romania's current position is quite difficult. Germany and Hungary signed a business agreement a few days ago, stipulating that Hungary would grant Germany significant economic benefits in return for German support of Hungary's demands in Southeast Europe. Therefore, even if the Soviet Union demands that Romania organize a People's Government, the Romanian authorities would find it difficult to accept, only giving Germany an opportunity to actively support Hungary's demands. (Havas Agency, 23rd)

Bucharest - The Romanian government is currently seeking Soviet approval to appoint former Foreign Minister Gafencu as ambassador to the Soviet Union. It is rumored that the Soviet Union has sent a note to the Romanian government requesting that it revise its current system of governance in a more democratic direction. This cannot be confirmed here. However, political circles acknowledge that the attitude of the Axis powers has brought Romania and the Soviet Union closer together. The appointment of Gafencu is the first step in this direction, especially since Gafencu is the most acceptable figure to Moscow. (Reuters Agency, 23rd)

Berlin - The German News Agency announced that the German government has invited the Bulgarian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister to Berlin. It is generally believed that the Romanian Foreign Minister will also come to Germany soon for a short visit. (Reuters Agency, 23rd)

### Soviet Government Bonds: Oversubscribed

### British Foreign Secretary Delivers Speech: Rejects Hitler's Peace Proposal; Reaffirms Determination Not to Cease Fire Until Freedom is Achieved; Will Resist Evil Forces to the End with Various Self-Governing Territories

London - British Foreign Secretary Halifax broadcast from London last night, rejecting Hitler's call for England to cease fire and reaffirming the determination not to cease fire until freedom is achieved. He said, "We certainly know that this struggle will make us sacrifice everything, but because what we defend is worth any sacrifice, it is a noble cause to be the defender of such treasures: free people rather than slaves, free countries rather than German dependencies, and a national society of free cooperation to seek the welfare of the whole. This is the pillar of a new and better order that the British people want to see. I hope that today's Britain, which is guiding the war to avoid the endless tragedy of mankind that Hitler's victory would surely bring, will be a guiding path so that all peoples can move towards a better life. We and our overseas self-governing territories will always insist on resisting evil forces. Hitler is now ordering Britain to submit to his wishes. I don't want to waste time refuting his distortions of various major events since the start of the war."

Hitler's Appeal is Based on Panic

"Hitler claims he does not want to destroy the British Empire, but there is no suggestion in his remarks that peace must be based on justice, nor is there any recognition of the right of other European countries to self-determination, a principle that Hitler often invokes for the Germans. What Hitler is appealing for is nothing more than based on fear. What Hitler is arguing is nothing more than a threat. He says nothing about the future of the countries he has seized with false pretenses, which is very important. It is clear that Hitler's so-called Europe is a Europe where Germany rules over people whose freedom has been taken away, while our so-called Europe is very different from what President Roosevelt and South African Prime Minister Smuts have said. We want to see Europe as a free group of independent countries. If it is not, we will never be moved by threats. Hitler has now made it clear that he is preparing to bring all of Germany's power to bear on Britain. This is why every city, town, and village in Britain has only one kind of strong and unyielding spirit. Everyone knows that if Hitler wins, then everything we consider worth living for will be completely destroyed."

Will Not Cease Fire Until Freedom is Guaranteed

"We do not want war. There is no one here who wants the war to be extended a day longer than necessary. But we will not cease fire until our freedom and the freedom of others has been guaranteed. We want to be able to live our own lives as we wish, and not constantly look around to guard against secret police listening nearby. We want to serve the true God as we wish, and this kind of religious freedom is based on the conscience that we cannot indulge, because conscience is not something we can hand over to others. But in Germany, its people have handed over their conscience to Hitler, so they have become machines. What impact does this have on Hitler? When Hitler first seized power, he carefully declared that his goals were limited and that he was only concerned with the happiness of Germany and had no demands on neighboring countries, but his desires gradually increased, and today he claims to be the supreme protector. Hitler has established his rule in Central and Northern Europe, and as for the south, he has not fought against France, but seeing Hitler's victory in France and reporting to Mussolini, he may give him the position of master of the Mediterranean, which he has not conquered."

Germany Wants to Determine the Fate of Other Countries by Force

"In Hitler's view, force has become the final determinant of the fate of individuals and nations. Since Germany has this force, it is the only country that can decide how all nations will live in the future. As for whether the people want it, he does not care. Hitler believes that people are fragile creatures born to obey, who will soon know how to obey their master. As for respect for promises, in Hitler's view, it is a sign of weakness, and the idea of legal equality is also intolerable to Hitler. Hitler himself has acts of betrayal, cruelty, and sin, so betrayal, cruelty, and sin have become rights. This is the responsibility of us Christians to resist with all our strength."

Oppressed Nations Look to England for Counterattack

"The people of the British Empire and those who love truth, justice, and freedom cannot accept Hitler's new world. As we consider the future, there is much to be relieved about. Hitler can set up his 卐 flag at will, but if Hitler cannot destroy the strength of Britain, then the foundation of his empire is built on sand. The oppressed people are full of grief and indignation, and are constantly praying that Hitler's offensive will be shattered before the fortresses of the British Isles. They look to us and must not let them down. There will eventually be a day of reckoning, and at that time, the German people's wild plans for Europe will be defeated by the insurmountable passion of the people for freedom."

American People Increasingly Disgusted by Hitler's Actions

"Outside of Europe, across the Atlantic, there is a great power that is becoming increasingly disgusted with Hitler's actions. The American people, who have worked hard to build their country, will not want to obey a madman. They have examined Hitler's narrow and distorted ideas and feel that what he advocates is the way of hatred, what he does is the act of violence, and what he gives to mankind is the action of enslaving the human soul. The great people of the United States are as sincere as we are in seeking victory and resisting aggression. This is something we are happy to hear. Their country, like ours, is based on Christian teachings and faith in God. We should each call on heaven to bless what we love and bless our cause, and then, with this spirit, proceed in this sacred war. We and our self-governing territories will always resist evil forces, and although we know the danger of our work, we will move forward with the belief that we will eventually be victorious with the help of God." (Reuters Agency, 23rd)

### Germany's Offensive Against England: The Time is Not Yet Ripe; German Side Attaches Importance to the British Prime Minister's Speech

Berlin - The official German news agency, the German News Agency, accused Churchill of responding to Hitler's peace proposals by intensifying the bombing of German civilians, and said that Germany may immediately launch its vaunted all-out war on England. A German government spokesman said that Germany's blitzkrieg against England is now only waiting for the British Prime Minister's speech in the House of Commons this afternoon. If the German proposals are completely rejected, then the war on England will begin immediately. According to official sources, Halifax's speech yesterday afternoon cannot be considered completely formal, but Churchill's rejection of peace talks may remove the "moral barrier" to aggression. Previously, German leaders had all harbored a hope that a revolution would occur in England, overthrowing the current government and negotiating peace with Germany. Now, this hope has been abandoned. Well-informed sources say that Germans now deeply believe that the British people no longer have the opportunity to overthrow their government. According to high-ranking sources, it is not yet known when the long-rumored offensive against England will be launched. It is expected to be officially announced within a few days. However, they also said that an attack of such a large scale, as dreamed of by Hitler, requires endless preparation and planning. Hitler seems to be still waiting for the time to be ripe so that he has sufficient strength on the sea, land, and air to control the power of victory. (International News Agency, 23rd)

Berlin - Britain's rejection of Hitler's peace appeal last night blamed President Roosevelt for "joint responsibility." An authoritative source said, "After Churchill's speech, we will be able to understand how events will unfold." Britain's rejection of Hitler's speech is "new evidence of the British government's lack of thought and irresponsibility, thus leading the British people into dangerous straits. (United Press, 23rd)

Washington - A government spokesman here refused to comment on British Foreign Secretary Halifax's speech last night rejecting Hitler's "appeal to reason," but senior administrative officials here clearly welcomed the speech. People here believe that now is not an appropriate time for democratic countries to accept peace, and Halifax's statement that most countries overseas are opposed to Hitler's policies is intended to bring the entire Western Hemisphere into the anti-Nazi camp. (United Press, 23rd)

Berlin - A German Foreign Ministry spokesman told foreign reporters here today that Berlin believes British Foreign Secretary Halifax's broadcast speech is Britain's negative response to Hitler's peace proposals. Halifax's speech is full of hypocrisy. The British Foreign Secretary refused to listen to Hitler's statement that Germany had no intention of destroying the British Empire. The British government is obviously making decisions based on the theories of other statesmen. History will show whether this move by Britain is a wise decision. Germany's attitude has been clearly expressed in Hitler's speech and can be discussed no further. Now Halifax and his British government and the British people have answered with a "no." Germany must now also give a reply. (Haitong News Agency, 23rd)

### British and American Public Opinion Respond: The Foreign Secretary's Speech Clarifies Moral Issues

London - The Times commented on Foreign Secretary Halifax's speech today, saying that Halifax has clarified in clear terms the moral issues involved in this war, saying that Germany's doctrine is to make all countries its dependencies and to be controlled by the master, while Britain advocates liberalism, by countries forming a group to cooperate with each other, to manage the welfare of the whole, and to unite with each other with justice and integrity. This ideal concept of international life is the main purpose of Britain, but it is not unique to Britain. Most other countries hold this view. Britain is determined to make the principles that Britain and the freedom-loving countries regard as more precious than their own lives win victory. The Allies will eventually win, because the human passion for freedom is truly insurmountable. The Daily Telegraph said that Foreign Secretary Halifax's speech was the same as that issued by President Roosevelt last week, and has raised the point of contention to a higher level, and mentioned the final sincerity of free people in the doctrine of fighting to the death. The newspaper also commented on Hull's speech at the Pan-American Conference, saying that its meaning must not be misunderstood by Berlin, and its statement prohibiting interference in the territories of European countries in the Western Hemisphere is clear and unmistakable. On both sides of the Atlantic, we have reached an era in history where economic plans and "new measures" can no longer be limited by national borders. There is no reason to fear for a long time that American policy will make it difficult for the British navy to blockade enemy territory or prevent supplies from reaching enemy territory through indirect routes. (Reuters Agency, 23rd)

London - News from around the world has expressed enthusiastic support for British Foreign Secretary Halifax's speech. Newspapers in New York gave detailed coverage and positive comments on Halifax's speech. The point that was unanimously emphasized was that Halifax had rejected Hitler's peace offensive, and its wording left no doubt about Britain's determination to continue fighting until freedom was won. (Reuters Agency, 23rd)

### German Invasion of England: Not Easy to Achieve Success; Observations of a Famous American Aviator

London - The New York Times today published an article by Major General Seversky, a famous aviator and aircraft designer, stating that if the British side maintains control of the air over the British Isles and the English Channel for a long time, then the German invasion of England cannot succeed. Without the protection of a large air force, it is unimaginable to transport large armies to land. This has been seen in the retreat of the Allied forces from Dunkirk, because the Allied forces were able to withdraw thanks to the British control of the air. Although the number of British and German aircraft is different, there is no doubt about the British defensive advantage. Judging from the results of German air raids so far, it can be seen that Germany cannot complete the first stage necessary for its invasion of England with its current equipment, that is, to seize air supremacy over British territory. The moment Germany originally set for the invasion of England has quietly passed, and the new period for the invasion of England must be delayed. The reason is here. The scale of German air raids on England is not large, the effectiveness is small, and the losses are extremely high, often losing half of them. The German side has obviously failed to destroy the British air force. Although the bad weather has improved the British defensive position, it has not seriously hindered its air strikes. When it comes to late autumn and winter, there are more days suitable for flying over Germany than over the British Isles, so winter warfare is indeed favorable to the British side. Germany must start its invasion immediately, or we must wait until next spring, but since Germany's current equipment cannot break through Britain's air defenses, there is really no hope of success in invading England. (Reuters Agency, 23rd)

### British Government Assists: Czech Restoration

London - Prime Minister Churchill announced in the House of Commons this afternoon that after Foreign Secretary Halifax conducted negotiations with Dr. Beneš, representing the Czech National Committee, the British government has decided to recognize the committee as the Czech provisional government.

### British Bomber Squadron: Again Attacks the European Continent; Airports in France, the Netherlands, and Germany are Bombed; Large German Aircraft Factory Suffers Night Attack

London - A large squadron of British Air Force bombers flew to German territory and German-occupied areas to launch large-scale attacks. A 15,000-ton German supply ship off the coast of Denmark was also among the targets. Oil tanks in Ghent caught fire after being hit. In air battles around the British coast yesterday, four German aircraft were destroyed and the British side lost two fighter planes. According to an Air Ministry communiqué, British aircraft sorties attacked oil tanks in places like Rotterdam, shipyards in places like Wesma, storage yards in aircraft factories, ships in the Vise River canal, and airfields in France, the Netherlands, and Germany. Three British aircraft went missing. It is now confirmed that German aircraft recently raided Britain at night, and one crashed after hitting a balloon cable. After British aircraft attacked Ghent, an oil tanker in the Salreid Canal there caught fire after being hit. British aircraft attacked a major German aircraft factory at night, dropping more than 35 tons of high-explosive bombs and hundreds of incendiary bombs. The factory in Göttingen caught fire after being hit, and flames soared into the sky. Nine enemy airfields and seaplane bases were also attacked by the British Air Force at night. (Reuters Agency, 23rd)

London - The headquarters of General Teger, commander of the French forces in England, issued a communiqué stating that on Sunday night, French pilots participated in the British Air Force's attack on northwestern Germany. Although they encountered fierce resistance from ground defenses, the French pilots were still able to bomb their targets and returned safely after achieving significant battle results. (Reuters Agency, 23rd)

Stamford - A Turkish traveler who had just arrived here told a Reuters reporter today about the damage caused by British air raids on Germany. He said that he had traveled to Hamburg, Emden, Bremen, Düsseldorf, Cologne, and Essen and saw that almost none of the factories were intact. From what he saw, it was clear that the British Air Force only bombed military targets, and most of the civilians had been evacuated. The German authorities are doing their best to prevent news of material damage from spreading to other parts of Germany, so the people of Berlin know very little. Hitler still seems to be supported by the Nazis, but others have begun to understand the dangers and difficulties of invading England. (Reuters Agency, 23rd)

London - A Navy Ministry communiqué said that yesterday morning, a squadron of Navy Air Arm's Skua aircraft attacked Bergen. Due to bad weather and poor visibility, the main objective could not be achieved, but they dropped bombs on a seaplane base and sank an enemy anti-aircraft ship. Skua aircraft are the Navy Air Arm's dive bombers. (Reuters Agency, 22nd)

### German Side Announces Air Force Battle Results

Berlin - The official news released by the German High Command yesterday was supplemented by military experts as follows: The great effectiveness of the German Air Force's attacks on British merchant ships has been confirmed by the Supreme Commander of the Air Force yesterday. As a result of the German Air Force's attack on a convoy in the English Channel, a tanker and four merchant ships were sunk, with a total tonnage of over 40,000 tons. The sinking of the tanker is a major blow to Britain because Britain can no longer freely transport oil from Iraq to Britain from the eastern Mediterranean. It now has to detour around the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa, which is six times longer than the Mediterranean route. In other words, the number of tankers needed by Britain has also increased six times compared to before. The German aircraft team's attack on British aircraft hangars, harbor facilities, and factories on July 21 was also very effective, especially the bombing of reservoirs. The report also said that two German Red Cross ambulances were shot down by British aircraft in the North Sea. This is the third time German Red Cross aircraft have been shot down. The aircraft are painted all white and the red cross is even more clearly visible, and they are very easy to distinguish from fighter planes and destroyers. The attack on the Red Cross aircraft is truly regrettable, because the aircraft treat the enemy's victims equally. (Haitong News Agency, 23rd)

Berlin - This afternoon's German military report said that a German midget submarine sank as much as 18,000 tons of British convoy cargo. Yesterday, German aircraft flew reconnaissance missions over England and Scotland, and bombed various seaports, airfields, anti-aircraft batteries, and searchlight locations day and night. Pembroke, Chatham, Sheerness, Edinburgh, and Aberty were the most heavily bombed ports. Three merchant ships in the English Channel were bombed by German aircraft. One German aircraft went missing. It has now been confirmed that the number of enemy aircraft shot down by German anti-aircraft fire during the bombing of Wilhelmshaven on Saturday night (20th) was not only four, but actually six.

### British Navy Ministry Announces: Merchant Ship Losses

London - The Navy Ministry announced that in the week ending July 15, a total of 61,032 tons of merchant ships were lost due to enemy action, including nine British ships totaling 32,163 tons, four Allied ships totaling 7,335 tons, and six neutral ships totaling 20,734 tons. (Reuters Agency, 23rd)

### Foreign Aircraft Appear: Over Gibraltar

Madrid - According to news received here, yesterday several aircraft of unknown nationality circled over the Gibraltar fortress. British anti-aircraft batteries immediately opened fire. At 11:15 AM, 30 aircraft of unknown nationality invaded the airspace over the fortress, but did not drop bombs.

### Mines Laid: Outside Irish Territorial Waters

London - The British Navy authorities have secretly laid mines in the Irish Sea to prevent Hitler from using Ireland as a way to invade England. According to the Navy Ministry, mines have been laid outside Irish territorial waters. This move makes it dangerous for ships entering this part of the Irish Sea or the Bristol Channel, and cuts off a portion of the Irish coastline. Now ships traveling from Falmouth to Bristol must detour to the right, past southern and northern Ireland, before reaching their destination. (Reuters Agency, 23rd)

### British King Inspects: Coastal Airfield

### German Government Announces: Secret Anglo-French Documents, Minutes of the French National Defense Committee Meeting: Plan to Bomb Romanian Oilfields

Berlin: The Anglo-French plan to bomb Romanian oilfields was completed in the autumn of 1939. This shocking action was discovered in a report written by Wang Jia, a former special commissioner of the French government, in October of last year. Nine excerpts from it will be published today in Berlin from the secret political archives of the French General Staff. Wang Jia was appointed by the former French Minister of Public Works to work in the French Embassy in Bucharest. His task was to draft a plan to destroy the oilfield refineries, storage tanks, and transportation routes, and to implement this mission. This conspiracy was no different from the Allied Powers' demand in 1916 to cut off Germany's oil supply from Romania. The destruction plan had to completely destroy everything. On September 16, Wang Jia, accompanied by his assistant, Captain Angoud, arrived in Bucharest. Wang immediately contacted the French Ambassador and other embassy staff. Because the scope of the task was extensive, personnel were added under Wang's command. The report stated that all the staff were French, engineers from an oil company, and were given military ranks when hired. Each was a specialist in oil production and head of a specific category. On September 18, Wang was introduced to Sir Hoare, the British Minister in Bucharest. Some of the staff and engineers in the British Embassy had cooperated with Wang Jia in 1916 in the plan to destroy the oilfields. The report stated that the French drafted two plans, and the British reviewed and criticized them. The plan stated that temporary and hasty destruction would not be effective, and burning oil wells was not an important task. What needed to be destroyed were drilling machines, production machines, transportation tools, and refining machines. The effect of setting fires was not permanent. It takes three months to drill an oil well, but it takes a year to build a refinery. Therefore, the destruction must be extensive and permanent, and prevent the use of semi-destroyed parts to build a new plant. To achieve this goal, a dual plan was drafted, which could be implemented within 24 hours (working ten hours a day). The most important oil wells (80%), all refineries, pumping machines, and oil storage were to be destroyed, so that the oil fields could not be used for at least six months, and 75% of the current oil production would be destroyed. This plan would take ten days to a month to complete. If many important storage tanks and transportation routes could be destroyed, 90% of the production could be eliminated. The explosives needed had already been prepared, and several drainage ditches had been dug to flood the oil wells. The burning of raw materials could be included, and fire could be used to complete the destruction at the end. (Haitong Telegraph, 23rd)

Berlin: Last autumn, the Allied Powers planned to block the Douli River in Romania. Fortunately, this violation of international law was discovered by Germany and stopped in time. The secret telegram sent by the former French Ambassador to Bucharest to the French Foreign Minister on September 28 last year was about this matter. The ambassador's telegram stated: "I believe that regarding the blocking of the Danube River, we should immediately implement it, so that the inland river traffic between Romania and Germany is completely cut off. It is reported that Germany intends to send a part of the Rhine River Fleet to the Danube River. The interruption of the river's traffic is extremely beneficial to us and can have the same effect as destroying the oilfields, because this move will simultaneously stop the transportation of oil and grain. The value of these products accounts for 80% of Romania's exports to Germany. The implementation of this plan is very simple, and all the measures taken will be reported in the next telegram." In early April of this year, this French conspiracy was carried out. At that time, more than a dozen barges and several British speedboats went to the Danube River, carrying a large number of handguns, ammunition cartridges, depth charges, mines, and thousands of boxes of explosives. The boats contained specially trained British officers wearing sailors' uniforms with forged passports, who were going to block the Danube River by force. However, this attempt was fortunately stopped by Germany in time and failed to materialize. (Haitong Telegraph, 23rd)

Berlin: The French National Defense Committee held a meeting on April 9, chaired by President Lebrun. It was decided to invade Belgium at that time. The minutes of this meeting will be published in Berlin today.

General Gamelin supported the invasion of Belgium. Minister of Defense Daladier also advocated this military action. The National Defense Committee immediately unanimously resolved the following items: (1) The French government requests the Belgian government to allow operations in Belgium; (2) Military operations will begin immediately after obtaining permission; (3) Request the laying of mines in the Belgian rivers; (4) The French government informs the Norwegian government of its willingness to provide assistance; (5) The Prime Minister, Minister of Defense, Minister of the Army, and Admiral Darlan are scheduled to go to London in the afternoon. (Haitong Telegraph, 23rd)

### French Ministry of Agriculture Relocates Back to Paris

Vichy: In order to expedite the French government's relocation back to Paris, the French and German authorities have recently agreed to relocate the Ministry of Agriculture to Paris first. At the same time, farmers, rural technicians, wine industry instructors, flour industry, sugar industry, agricultural labor unions, and agricultural cooperatives, as the harvest season approaches, will be ordered to resume activities and will do their best to provide relief for food in areas devastated by the war. (United Press, 23rd)

### Second Batch of Australian Troops Arrives in England

London: Sydney Radio stated that the Australian reinforcements, including the railway forestry unit that left Sydney on May 22 and the nurses who embarked from Melbourne on May 23, have now arrived in England and joined the Australian troops already in England. Their safe arrival in England proves the absurdity of the German claim of blockading England, and shows that the broadcasts of Rome and Berlin regarding Australian troops are merely their imagination. According to Axis broadcasts, Australia refuses to send more soldiers abroad. (Reuters, 23rd)

### Mauritius Islands Pledge Allegiance to England

London: Sir Clifford, the governor of the British-led Mauritius Islands in the Indian Ocean, yesterday presented Secretary of the Navy Alexander with a silver cigarette case, a gift from the people of the colony to the British warship Mauritius, at the Admiralty. The case contained two checks, one for £11,000 to purchase a seaplane for the warship, and the other for £150,000, donated to the British government as war expenses. Sir Clifford said that many of the donations were from French people, and their loyalty to the Allied cause would never waver. (Reuters, 23rd)

### Dutch People Passively Resist

London: The Dutch radio station controlled by the Germans broadcast yesterday, appealing to many Dutch people who refuse to participate in the construction of a new country, or who remain aloof and suspicious, or who are unwilling to give up their comfortable lives. It is claimed that "Surprisingly, even those who have nothing to lose besides themselves hold a hostile attitude towards the new order. Why are we so angry that the Dutch people are avoiding involvement? Why refuse to listen to the radio? The old days will never return, why are we sad?" The reporter from the radio station then mentioned the Dutch "whispering campaign," saying that the radio station would stipulate a 15-minute period each day to discuss current affairs issues. (Reuters, 23rd)

### Shanghai American Association Sends Telegram to Washington Calling For Stricter Policy on Far East Amid Tensions Due to Terrorist Activities

Yesterday at 12:15 PM, the executive committee of the Shanghai American Association held a meeting at the American Club on Fuzhou Road. According to reliable sources, members of the association, in light of the terrorist activities and anti-American sentiment discovered in Shanghai, convened a special meeting to discuss measures and send a telegram to Washington requesting the United States to adopt a stronger attitude towards the Far East. It is said that this telegram will be sent in the name of the Shanghai American Association. According to reports, the anti-American sentiment of the Japanese in this city began with the case of the American Navy arresting Japanese military police on the third anniversary of the July 7th Incident. The comments in the Japanese newspapers at that time were filled with animosity towards the United States between the lines. Subsequently, anti-American slogans and leaflets were found in the Hongkou District. As for the "expulsion order" issued by the Nanjing "government" against six well-known American journalists in this city, it can also be regarded as an expression of anti-American sentiment. It is reported that the six people on the "blacklist" opened by the Nanjing "government" are Allman, Powell, Ermert, Starr, Gold, Fiers, and Mills. It is said that the meeting held by the American Association yesterday also discussed the recent terrorist activities, including the bombing of Shen Bao and the assassination of Zhang Sixu.

New York Times Comments on New Order

The English-language Da Mei Evening News reported that, according to a telegram received today by the New York Times' Far East representative Apongt, the New York Times published an editorial yesterday entitled "New Order." The content roughly stated that in a week in which terrorist activities were used against Chinese, American, and British journalists in Shanghai, a Chinese student who had studied in the United States was assassinated. Reporters received advice and wore bulletproof vests or were accompanied by bodyguards. The New York Times reporter Apongt reported that he was abused by Japanese thugs and various manuscripts were stolen. This shows the true situation under a regime that prides itself on being able to restore order in the Far East.

No Progress in the Case of American Journalist

The Zi Lin West News reported that the Japanese authorities refused to make any comments regarding the incident in which Apongt, the Far East manager of the New York Times, was insulted by two Japanese at his Broadway Building residence around 12:00 noon on the 10th. At a reception for journalists, Japanese Embassy spokesman Tsurumi Ken stated, "Regarding Apongt's unfortunate encounter, we have received a protest from the US Consulate General on July 20. We greatly respect Mr. Apongt. This case is a complicated issue and is currently under investigation. We cannot repeat other comments." Apongt was also present at the reception and immediately pointed out that the two Japanese were not ordinary bandits. They had obtained cash and several valuables, but left them in place, which showed that they were clearly ordered to obtain certain manuscripts. Would this narrow the scope of the investigation? Tsurumi Ken replied that this was a very interesting suggestion, but he could not repeat other comments besides that the investigation was in progress. Apongt then said that the manuscripts were easily destroyed, and the Japanese authorities should speed up the investigation, because the two Japanese found the manuscripts, which were of no value to them and would probably destroy them. The spokesman replied, "We are asking the police department to speed up the investigation, but Apongt should know that this case is quite complicated."

### Shanghai West Special Police Issue: Final Discussions to be Held; Compromise Expected by End of Month

The English-language Da Mei Evening News reported that Captain Shi Mao, the acting police chief of the Public Concession (Police Chief Major Bao Wen is currently on leave), told reporters this morning (23rd) that regarding the establishment of a joint police force between the Public Concession Bureau and the "Municipal Government" in the outer road area, the police department has prepared a detailed report and submitted it to Fei Lipu, the director-general of the Public Concession Bureau, and Fei will hold final discussions with "Mayor" Fu Xiaoan in the near future. This statement heralds the hope that the establishment of the joint police force will be agreed upon soon. According to another source, the establishment of the joint police force is expected to be agreed upon within the month, after which the two parties will discuss the donation tax and court issues included in the agreement signed in February of this year.

### News of the Recapture of Zhenhai Arrives: Morale in Shanghai Boosted; Electricity and Telephone Services in the City Restored; No Gaps Left in the New Blockade Line

Zhenhai County and its key fortresses have been recaptured, and the artillery units have all returned to defense. This city has received a telegram from Ningbo stating that electricity and telephone services have been restored. Yesterday, County Chief Yu of Yin County telegraphed a certain group in this city to announce the victory. (Details omitted) Zhaobao Mountain, Pingyuan, Hongyuan, Weiyuan Forts, as well as Jinji Mountain and Qi's Mountain, were recaptured by our army in succession on the morning of the 22nd. On the afternoon of the 22nd, six Japanese warships were anchored on the sea surface of Taiping Mountain near Longshan. There are no Japanese warships outside Zhenhai Port. Yu Jimin bowed. This city has also received telegrams about the situation at the time of the recapture. Since dawn on the 22nd, the Huajun division recaptured key points such as Jinji Ridge. The Huo regiment of the division captured Hongyuan Fort. At 3:03, the Zhou regiment of the division recaptured Zhenhai County. At 8:10, the Hua army occupied Zhaobao Mountain. All the remaining Japanese fled back to the ships in a panic. Xiaogang was recovered by the division of the Hua army. As for Pingyuan Fort, it was recovered as early as the 18th. The Japanese army abandoned a lot of guns, ammunition, etc. The county government, county party headquarters, and police station have moved back to the city to work. Because street battles had taken place in the city, there were many corpses left, which have already begun to be buried. The area where the fighting took place has been cleaned up. Most of the refugees in the city fled to the countryside and have also returned one after another.

Sandu Bay is Under Martial Law with Mines

According to maritime information, there are no Japanese troops in Sandu Bay, but the island has been declared under martial law, and dangerous objects such as mines have been placed, so it is feared that it will be difficult to resume navigation for the time being. The details are as follows: (1) According to sources from the Fujian Fellow Association, Sandu Island was indeed bombarded by Japanese warships gathered in the Minhai area on the 21st, and residents of the island fled to Ningde District, which is more than ten miles away from the island. (2) According to a private telegram from the Min merchants in Shanghai, Ningde was bombed indiscriminately by a large number of Japanese aircraft the day before yesterday. (3) According to the telegram bureau of the Ministry of Communications on Edward Road, telegrams sent from Shanghai to Sandu are received and sent as usual, but the bureau has not confirmed whether they can reach their destination. (4) According to the American news agency, telegrams between Shanghai and Sandu are received and sent directly as usual without any problems.

Portuguese Ship Detained at Wenzhou Port

The Zi Lin West News reported that Shanghai received news yesterday (22nd) that the Portuguese ship Sinta and its captain Haniho and crew members have been detained by the Japanese naval authorities outside Wenzhou. It is heard that the ship left Wenzhou after the Japanese authorities prohibited navigation. According to reports, Sinta has been sailing to Wenzhou for two months. Several other Portuguese ships sailing between Shanghai and Wenzhou are now idle in this city.

Shipping Companies Predict Future Shipping Affairs

According to shipping observations, the resumption of merchant ships sailing between Shanghai and Ningbo in the future will be affected, because the Ningbo military authorities have built a new blockade line near Meixu in the Yongjiang River, which is very solid and does not leave any gaps. Therefore, the small boats sailing between Ningbo and Zhenhai have not resumed. In addition, the merchant ship docks on the north bank of Ningbo Jiangbei have also been completely destroyed, so it will take a considerable amount of time to rebuild them. According to this observation, it is feared that the resumption of shipping between Shanghai and Ningbo will be difficult to achieve in the short term. As for the blockade line outside Zhenhai Port, the Japanese have destroyed a lot of it, which has now been repaired. In addition to using the docks and ships of Ning Shao Sanbei Hongan Merchants as the blockade line for the new blockade line in Meixu, the new Keston ship of the German company Haibi Ocean and the Yongmin ship (formerly the Suinan patrol ship) were also sunk in the blockade line. Now the Haibi Ocean company has received a report from the owner of the Keston ship detailing the sinking. Currently, the ships sailing between Shanghai and Ningbo are moored at the Huangpu Manzu various pontoons and docks. Once the military action stops, the German companies Lihe, Lulin, and Far East, the Italian companies Yihua and Lococia, and the Norwegian company Hualun, etc., will try to resume shipping to protect the rights and interests of the shipping companies. According to a reporter from Da Guang She, after the Japanese tax officer of the Customs notified the shipping companies to sail to the ports of Minjiang, Hanjiang, Sandu Ao, Oujiang, and Jiang, the Jianghai Customs has not yet resumed customs clearance for the above ports as of yesterday.

Shanghai-Wenzhou Sailing Ships Will Sail When Opportunity Arises

The Feikang ship of Lulin Shipping Company is expected to arrive in the city from Wenzhou around noon today. According to the company, if the situation is good, the ship is scheduled to sail to Wenzhou again before next Monday. In addition, the Xinanni ship of Weilihani Company, which previously postponed its voyage to Wenzhou, is now expected to announce its sailing schedule soon.

### Final Verdict and Utmost Mourning: Zhang Sixu Embalmed Yesterday, More Than 600 People Went to the American Church to Offer Condolences, Funeral at Hongqiao Cemetery Concluding a Glorious Life

After the death of Mr. Zhang Sixu, director of the board of directors of the Chinese and English Da Mei Evening News and Da Mei Daily and sales director of Aetna Life Insurance Company, all party-state elites and Chinese and foreign people mourned in unison. Mr. Zhang's remains were moved from the International Funeral Home to the American Church on Badang Road at 7:00 AM yesterday, and a solemn and respectful funeral ceremony was held at 9:00 AM, and then sent to Hongqiao Cemetery for burial. All parties mourned together, and the whole country was shocked and mourned. Mr. Zhang's posthumous honor can follow his chastity and courage and smile in Jiuquan. The news obtained yesterday is compiled as follows:

Mourning the Deceased in the Cold Wind and Bitter Rain

At 7:00 AM yesterday, Mr. Zhang's coffin was moved from the International Funeral Home on Jiaozhou Road by a technician to the American Church at No. 53 Badang Road. From 8:00 AM, Mrs. Zhang, accompanied by her daughter and maid, arrived at the church by car. All the employees of the Chinese and English Da Mei Evening News and Da Mei Daily and Aetna Life Insurance Company, as well as Mr. Zhang's Chinese and Western former friends, arrived in succession in cars and group buses in the cold wind and bitter rain to participate, totaling about 600 people. Dozens of Chinese and Western detectives were densely arranged around the church, and an armored vehicle was stationed on the roadside to provide protection.

Simple and Solemn Funeral Ceremony

The architecture of the American Church is very magnificent. Mr. Zhang's American-style copper coffin was placed in front of the altar, covered with a bunch of fresh flowers. A copper plate was also placed on the coffin lid, engraved with (Sumiel·H·Chang) in Western characters, which is Mr. Zhang's Western name. The coffin was surrounded by wreaths from all walks of life. A piano was placed on the altar, and four or five hundred rattan chairs were placed under the stage. The arrangement was extremely simple and solemn. When the ceremony was in progress and the coffin was moved out, Chinese and Western reporters competed to capture various situations with cameras.

Chinese and Foreign Guests Pay Their Respects to the Remains

At exactly 9:00 AM, the religious ceremony began. First, Deng Wanjun played mourning music, and Dr. Mai Meiling, the president of Zhijiang University, the officiating pastor, held a divine prayer. Then, Mrs. Wu Xinde sang a mourning song, accompanied by the piano. The singing was mournful and moving, evoking sad thoughts. After the song, Mr. Anderson took the stage to recall Mr. Zhang's life, moving the listeners. Finally, Pastor Mai Meiling read the Bible, and all the guests stood solemnly and sang hymns. Mr. Zhang's maid in the seat sobbed softly and wiped away tears with a handkerchief frequently, showing how deeply she mourned her master. At this point, the ceremony ended. The copper coffin was opened by a technician from the funeral home, and the guests paid their last respects in order, and then exited the church in sequence. After a while, led by Pastor Mai Meiling, Li Zufa, Wu Shougang, Shao Youlian, Hale, Starr, Bai Lusi, and Gold slowly carried the coffin out of the church, and then the technicians and workers loaded the coffin into the hearse parked on the roadside and drove westward to Hongqiao Cemetery.

A Life of Glory and Eternal Farewell

After the hearse moved, Mrs. Zhang and her daughter and other Chinese and Western relatives and former friends all took cars to the funeral, with detectives densely arranged along the way to provide protection. When the car arrived at the cemetery, a cloth curtain was set up on the tomb. After Master Mai Meiling made the final prayer, Mr. Zhang's chaste soul slowly sank into the tomb passage with this five-foot copper coffin, which had ended his life's glorious history. Mrs. Zhang and relatives were beside her with tears in their eyes, mourning this eternal farewell. After the funeral, Mrs. Zhang also went to the tomb of Mr. Zhang's mother and deceased son to add a visit, and then everyone dispersed.

Central Officials All Went to Pay Respects

According to reports, those who went to pay respects to Mr. Zhang yesterday morning included Shi Qingfu, representatives of the two members of the Central Committee, Jiang Bocheng and Wu Kaixian, and the Shanghai commissioner of the Central Propaganda Department. The condolence letter from the commissioner's office is recorded as follows: "The family of Mr. Zhang Sixu, I extend my regards. Mr. Sixu, with the generosity of a scholar, served as a commander and celebrity. He was brave, not frustrated in the slightest, loyal like Wang Zun who drove a chariot, and pure like Wen Xu who held a beard. Knowing that there was a crossbow ambush, he strode forward calmly. Recognizing that there was sand in the saliva, he still advanced without armor. When Peng's carriage fell and the carriage died, the whole country mourned. This office has reported the situation of the death to the Central Propaganda Department. In addition to the three ministers, Wang, Pan, and Dong, sending a special telegram of condolence, they also ordered this office to send representatives to pay respects and send a condolence payment of 1,000 yuan. I specially send a member to bring it. Please check and accept it. I send a special letter of condolence to express my condolences. Best regards. Commissioner's Office of the Central Propaganda Department stationed in Shanghai."

Condolences from All Parties Unanimously Mourning

(1) "The Secretariat of the Shanghai Chinese Seamen's Union, translated and sent to the funeral committee of Mr. Zhang Sixu to forward to the family of Mr. Zhang Sixu, I extend my regards. Mr. Sixu, upholding justice, speaking for the people, with noble character, was admired by both Chinese and foreigners. Now, he has been brutally attacked and died for the country, which is extremely sad. I hope you will restrain your grief and take care of the orphans to carry on your aspirations. I respectfully offer my condolences. Yang Hu bowed." (2) "The family of Mr. Zhang Sixu of the Shanghai Chinese Da Mei Daily, I extend my regards. I recently heard that my brother Sixu suddenly suffered the poisonous hands of villains, and I am extremely saddened. I send a special telegram of condolence. Wang Yaming of Guiyang Central Daily bowed."

### The Strike at the Shanghai Gas Company Continues; Authorities Attempt to Mediate; Gas Supply Normal and Uninterrupted; No Progress Between Labor and Management Yesterday

Following the complete strike by workers at both the old and new plants of the British Shanghai Gas Company, the labor-management standoff persists due to the firm stance of both sides. Gas supply to the city was briefly interrupted the day before yesterday, but was restored that evening. Eight workers arrested in Yangshupu the day before yesterday have also been released. Details are as follows:

Gas Supply Normal

Since the workers at the new Yangshupu plant joined the strike, and because the boiler room that supplies gas to the entire city is located in that plant, the company hired over fifty White Russians to take over the work to protect the interests of consumers. However, because these White Russians were inexperienced, gas supply was briefly interrupted the day before yesterday. After the company's Chief Engineer Mr. Samson and all the technicians supervised the White Russians in working overnight, gas supply to the city was resumed the day before yesterday evening. The company also hired a large number of White Russians to assist in the work, so the situation yesterday was good, and a gas panic in the city should not occur.

Workers Released

After eight workers at the new Yangshupu plant in Yangshupu were arrested the morning before yesterday, the workers sent representatives to the police station to demand their release. After several negotiations, all were released at 10 p.m. that evening. The reason for the arrest is rumored to be varied. Some say it was because the workers prevented the White Russians from going to work and were arrested, while others say it was due to other private matters. However, when reporters inquired with workers at the old plant, they were unable to accurately explain the true reason for their arrest.

Government Mediation

Yesterday, although there were no special actions by either labor or management to further worsen the situation, both sides maintained their firm stance, and no opportunity was found to bring the two sides closer. Although the concession authorities are closely monitoring the development of the labor unrest and thoroughly investigating the truth, after the failure of the Industrial Section's mediation, they are now preparing an effective mediation plan to alleviate social concerns.

Company Notice

In order to continue to supply gas to users, the company has resumed operations at all branch offices starting yesterday. The notice is as follows: "To our esteemed customers: Although the company has unfortunately experienced a sudden strike, for the convenience of our customers, the company is making every effort to maintain normal gas supply. Furthermore, all branch offices of the company will resume normal business hours starting Tuesday, July 23, 1940. This notice is for your information. By order of the Board of Directors, Secretary Brown."

### Visitor from Haiphong Talks; The Situation in Vietnam is Concerning; Since the Blockade of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, Japanese Personnel Have Been Very Active

According to a certain gentleman from the local transportation industry who recently returned to Shanghai from Vietnam, the situation in Vietnam after the implementation of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway blockade is as follows:

The Vietnamese People are Greatly Agitated

Since the French authorities in Vietnam accepted the Japanese demand to implement a blockade on the transport of military supplies on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway from July 1, the Vietnamese people have been greatly agitated. Japanese inspectors currently working in Vietnam have great power and often make things difficult even for the transport of non-military supplies, resulting in a decline in business on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway and substantial losses. The Japanese are also secretly monitoring the activities of overseas Chinese. The patriotic activities of overseas Chinese in Vietnam are often suppressed. These so-called "inspectors" are actually mostly army and navy personnel, and their mission is by no means simple. Furthermore, the Japanese are coming to Vietnam to travel in droves and are very active. The places they have been to are as clear as the palm of their hand.

Merchants' Goods are Mostly Sealed Up

Goods from this port destined for Haiphong have traditionally been transported via the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. However, due to the railway's busy freight traffic, vehicles are often insufficient. In addition, many goods from the United States cannot be transported for the time being, and a large amount of cargo is still piled up in Haiphong, not yet shipped. These goods are mostly the lifeblood of merchants and are unrelated to military needs. However, the French authorities in Vietnam blindly comply with the Japanese and have recently sealed up all the goods of the Chinese, estimating the value of the sealed goods to be as high as over ten million yuan. It is heard that the Chongqing National Government has protested to the French authorities.

### The Women and Children Relief Association is Raising Donations; Published a Letter to All Sectors

The China Women and Children Relief Association has organized a fundraising committee and has now selected No. 422, Xingye Building, 4th Jiangxi Road, Beijing Road, as its office and has begun operations. The association was founded in the third year of Xuantong and has been dedicated to rescuing lost and abducted women and children for over 30 years, numbering over ten thousand people. After the outbreak of the war, the Jiangwan Rehabilitation Center was hit hard, and the movable property of the center was completely destroyed. Since moving to Shanghai, the work has continued as usual. In addition to returning those who have been recovered at any time and introducing them to factories or businesses to learn skills to become self-reliant, the number of women and children in care has increased without decreasing. They are crying out for food and clothing, and with the current high prices of everything, they do not have enough to wear or eat, and their situation is extremely difficult. The fundraising committee has issued a letter to all sectors, earnestly requesting philanthropists to generously donate to support this sole Chinese organization for the relief of women and children, so that it can continue to exist forever, which is truly an immeasurable merit.

### A Fake Policeman Slipped into the French Concession; Was Driven Back to Nanshi

The English "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reported that a fake policeman belonging to the Nanshi garrison slipped into the French Concession on a bicycle without carrying weapons after 10 a.m. on the 23rd.

### The Second Batch of Subsidiary Currency Has Arrived in Shanghai; Temporarily Distributing Only the 5-Cent Denomination; Each Bag Contains 5,000 Coins

The Shanghai Banking Association previously approved the minting of 1-cent and 5-cent aluminum coins for supplementary issuance due to the subsidiary currency panic in Shanghai. The first batch of 50 million coins has already been exchanged, but they are still not widely seen in the market. It is now known that the second batch of aluminum subsidiary currency has arrived in Shanghai, but currently there is only the 5-cent aluminum coin, and the 2-cent aluminum coin is still being minted. This aluminum currency will still be exchanged by the Banking Association through the Bank Preparation Association. In order to promote widespread circulation, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce has notified all industry associations that if various industries need aluminum coins, they can apply to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce through their respective associations. After the Municipal Chamber of Commerce approves, it will then notify the Bank Preparation Association to exchange them separately. It is also learned that these 5-cent aluminum coins are packed in bags of 5,000 coins each, with each bag worth 250 yuan in national currency. It is best to make up at least the number of one bag for each exchange to avoid the trouble of piecemeal counting.

### The Ministry of Education Orders Students Studying in Hong Kong to Register in Hong Kong as Soon as Possible

(Hong Kong Correspondence) The education authorities formulated registration measures for students returning to China during the war of resistance last year and handled registration matters in Hong Kong. After the announcement of these measures, communication registration was often inconvenient due to many obstacles in transportation. A considerable number of students studying abroad and residing in Hong Kong were also found to be present. In view of this, the Ministry of Education reiterated the previous order, hoping that students studying abroad in Hong Kong who return to the country will register as soon as possible. The relevant instructions have now been received, and the following is an excerpt:

Ministry of Education Instructions It is noted that students studying abroad who graduate and return to China should submit their graduation certificates to the Ministry for registration and verification. The Ministry has previously announced registration measures for students returning to China, and has ordered all students to comply. It is now found that only a small number of students who have returned to China in recent years have complied with the above-mentioned regulations and completed the registration procedures. In order to understand the actual research situation of each student abroad and to facilitate the overall planning for the distribution of work after returning to China in the future, the previous order is hereby reiterated, hoping that all students studying in Hong Kong, after graduating and returning to China, must submit their graduation certificates to the Ministry for registration in order to facilitate assessment.

Registration Measures The registration measures are as follows: (1) All students who have been ordered by the Ministry to return to China or have returned to China on their own initiative since the outbreak of the War of Resistance may apply for registration in accordance with these measures. (2) Students applying for registration are limited to those who have already received a student certificate issued by the Ministry. (3) The registration location is in the Ministry in Chongqing, but those who are outside the country may use communication registration. For communication registration, all certificates should be sent by registered mail. The Ministry is not responsible for any loss in the mail. (4) When applying for registration, domestic school graduation certificates and foreign academic qualification documents should also be submitted for verification, along with two recent 2.5-inch half-length photos. After the certificates are verified and stamped, they will be returned immediately. (5) After the students have been reviewed and qualified, the Ministry will handle them separately in accordance with the following two items: (A) Those who have graduated from foreign colleges and universities or have graduated from domestic universities and have studied in foreign research institutes for more than one year will be introduced to work separately by the Ministry within the possible scope in accordance with their professional research, and the Ministry may designate corresponding work and give a living allowance as appropriate. (B) Those who had not graduated from domestic colleges and universities before going abroad, and who have not graduated from foreign colleges and universities, will be assigned to domestic schools for trial reading by the Ministry according to their subjects of study. After the term test passes, they will be compiled into formal students. (6) Students who have graduated from foreign colleges and universities, after registering in accordance with these measures, are exempt from the registration stipulated in Articles 25 or 32 of the Regulations on Studying Abroad, but self-funded students who have obtained master's and doctoral degrees must still submit a copy of their graduation thesis.

Although trading was still lively, most of it was swap transactions. Major banks were active in buying and selling, but the market was not affected. Only because American banks were still actively buying in the morning, the US dollar once appeared tight at 6.065 yuan. However, Japanese banks and Chinese speculators were unanimously selling, so supply and demand gradually balanced. The afternoon close was at the morning opening price. Later, it was heard that American banks and Zhengjin slightly sold, but were absorbed by HSBC, so the increase was minimal. As a result, British gold was 3 shillings 875 pence, and the US dollar was 6.25 yuan. Compared with the day before, both British and American currencies were unchanged.

Later, Japanese banks and Chinese speculators came to sell off, and gradually returned to the flat. Yuehua Bank would make the July US dollar at 6.1525 yuan that day.

The market was quiet and stable in the afternoon. After the silver banks slightly reduced their positions, they could not support the continued decline of more than ten yuan. At that time, the trading subsided and the market closed soon. The price was 5,270 yuan, which was 15 yuan lower than the previous close. The transaction was flat throughout the day, about 1,500 taels. The jewelry gold in the silver building remained unchanged, and the customs gold remained flat.

Gold Falls 15 Yuan

Since the beginning of the day, the price per bar (10 taels) was initially raised by 35 yuan due to the shrinking exchange rate and the tightening of the US dollar. The silver shops' gold purchase price was 5,329 yuan per ten taels. Later, because a certain money exchange bank's bulls released a large number of orders, and both Western and Chinese newspapers had negative news, those who were buying stopped. The price fell back by 65 yuan. The price of money exchange business for ten taels was 5,255 yuan. After that, the number of supporters decreased, and securities firms and retail investors took advantage of the low price to absorb them, and the price increased by 35 yuan. The securities firms purchased 20 taels from the silver shops for 5,290 yuan. Subsequently, the money exchange business and the silver shops came back to release them, and the price was reduced by 25 yuan. The price of the money exchange business for ten taels was reduced to 5,260 yuan. Then, the silver shops issued ten taels to the money exchange business, and the closing price was 5,270 yuan. The market trend was mediocre in the afternoon. The market opened slightly higher. The first silver shop helped the money exchange business with ten taels, and the price was 5,275 yuan. Subsequently, gold shops and English firms released them, and the price dropped by ten yuan. The price of gold shops near the silver shops was 5,265 yuan for ten taels. After entering, the securities firms purchased 40 taels from the silver shops, and the price was 5,270 yuan, which was the closing price for the evening. As a result, it fell by 15 yuan compared with the previous day. The fluctuation throughout the day was 65 yuan. The selling price of cash gold in the current silver shop's brand was more than ten yuan higher than that of spot gold. The purchase price was reduced by 30 yuan. The current standard gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there was little opening.

Jewelry Still Hanging at Old Prices

The price of jewelry gold per tael in the silver shops has not been changed. Datonghang still hangs at 540 yuan, and the new trade is similar to the above price. The purchase price is reduced by about 30 yuan.

### Foreign Currency Fluctuations Vary

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw spot gold rise and then fall, and British and American gold pounds followed suit, falling slightly by five cents. The demand for British gold notes suddenly increased, and the market price rose. American gold notes still did not escape the market trend and ended up rising slightly by six cents. The demand for Japanese gold notes and Korean notes decreased sharply, and the market prices unanimously weakened. The former was 1.21 yuan per share, and the latter was 1.05 yuan.

### Financial Commentary

— Sheng Kaiqiong

As of July 20 (Continued)

The so-called commercial exchange listing exchange rate is the listing price used by the Bank of Communications and the Bank of China to manage import and export foreign exchange. Since last July, British gold has been 7 pence, and the import price is 13.625 yuan. Now the black market price is about 4 pence and 6.25 yuan. Therefore, subscribing for 500 pounds of British gold at the commercial exchange price is 17,143 yuan, and at the black market price is 30,000 yuan. If subscribing for 1,000 US dollars, at the commercial exchange price is 7,339 yuan, and at the black market price is 16,000 yuan. The advantages and disadvantages are self-evident.

I sincerely advise the Chinese in Shanghai who have funds, instead of using a large amount of funds to engage in national goods, speculate on foreign exchange and foreign stocks, or acquire foreign exchange and foreign stocks as a way to protect wealth, why not invest in this construction gold public bond that saves the country, protects wealth, and has high profits!

Franc and Dollar Seek Connection

French Vietnam announced that all exports must be settled in US dollars or Dutch currency. Hong Kong and Singapore opposed this regulation and protested to Vietnam. Hong Kong business circles said that the goods that have been imported will still be handled according to the previous agreement, and the goods imported from Vietnam will be handled according to the new regulations. As for the reason why Vietnam took this measure, it is nothing more than that the franc has been linked to the US dollar, and it is naturally more advantageous to settle in US dollars than to settle in depreciated pounds.

According to France's policy of listening to the Nazis after investing in Germany, finance is of course no exception. Therefore, the franc, which has always been side by side with the pound, has also broken away from the pound's pricing. According to the German radio station's announcement on the 7th of this month, the franc will be priced according to the US dollar. Later, on the 13th, the semi-official news was that the franc was priced at 43 francs 30 centimes to one US dollar. According to this exchange rate, one franc will be equal to 2.31 US cents. According to the US exchange rate of 4.02, one pound is equal to 174 francs, which is two francs more expensive than 176 before France surrendered. However, since it is priced according to the US dollar, it must be converted according to the pound price on the New York market. According to the 3.91 on the 19th of this month, the franc on that day should be 169 to one pound.

Although the Nazis announced that they would link the franc to the US dollar, the New York market has not had a market since it was closed on June 17 until now. The following is a statistical table of the high and low prices of telegraphic transfers to Paris in the New York market in the past four years:

This Week's Foreign Exchange and Foreign Stocks

The changes in foreign exchange this week were slightly more moderate than the previous week, especially the changes in British gold were smaller. The fluctuation of the US dollar was 0.46875, while that of British gold was 0.09375. The US dollar was generally stable except for the initial tightness and then relaxation on Monday and Tuesday. British gold was also extremely calm except for the separate changes on Tuesday and Thursday. There have been many changes in the current situation this week. Before one wave has disappeared, another wave follows, such as the fact that Britain actually compromised with Japan and imposed a three-month blockade in Myanmar, but US Hull issued a statement protesting. Following this was the collapse of the Mitani cabinet and the entry of Kondō. There is an air of peace between China and Japan. In this way, it is impossible for people to analyze the true advantages and disadvantages and the true possible situation in a short time, and speculators can only blindly enter and exit. Because there are too many changes and the entry and exit are too fast, the changes in the market price cannot be followed, so in addition to the exporters selling slightly when the market was still tight at the beginning of the week, the importers have become silent again. This week there is also a basic factor affecting the foreign exchange market, that is, rumors that the British will abolish the use of free pounds. The agreement was established by the British and the US Federal Reserve Bank on the 18th. According to the market price of 4.02-4035, the pounds will be bought. From now on, the mutual payment between the pound group and the non-pound group will be at the statutory exchange rate. Switzerland, Canada, Newfoundland and other places will also adopt the same method, so the New York market once fluctuated. The free pound rose from 3 on the 13th to about 3.84, and fell to 3.775 on the 17th. Later, it rose straight to 3.91 on the 19th. The Shanghai exchange market was also greatly dominated by it. The average price of industrial stocks this week was 239.23, which was 15.91 higher than the previous week. The average price of rubber stocks was 261.16, which was 61.46 higher than the previous week. 2,483,939 shares were traded, with 28,256,200 yuan for industrial stocks, 7,773,500 yuan for rubber stocks, and 129,000 yuan for bonds, totaling 36 million yuan, an increase of about 22 million yuan compared with the 14 million yuan of the previous week. The rising trend was the strongest on Monday, and then it became flat, because the overall trend of foreign exchange tightened greatly on Monday, and then relaxed. (End)

### Securities: Foreign Stocks Profit-Taking, Domestic Bonds Buying Strong

The black market for securities moved up again yesterday. Various transactions were slightly more lively. There were also rumors of peace in the market. Although the matter was not necessarily true, it was said to be logical. The market had been waiting for a long time, so of course people were unwilling to give up the opportunity. Therefore, most people are long-term and short-term, and there is a purchase as soon as the market price falls. The current market price of each bond includes 3 yuan of interest, which makes the short sellers deeply worried. Yesterday, the purchases of various gangs were still stronger than the sales. Lianhe received more purchases. Hongda, Yitai, Renchang, Hu Heji, Xinfu, Lianyi, and Yuan all made up for their losses or made profits. However, Jiuxueyangchu has always been unremitting. Tongkang, Xuetai, Bie, and No. 16 all cut their positions or sold out, but supply and demand were still not balanced. Type A rebounded by 3 yuan, Type B approached 4 yuan again, Type C broke through 3 yuan again, and Type D broke through 1 yuan, and the trend gradually moved, and there was a possibility of continued rise. As a result, the market price rose by 2.5 cents to 6 cents. The total number of transactions was about 800,000 yuan. A series of clear tables are shown below.

Stock trading, 51 shares of Huacheng Tobacco Company were traded, and the price was 43 yuan.

Yesterday's dynamic of the plain business stock market was somewhat disappointing. The market atmosphere at the opening was extremely strong. After the opening, those who benefited competed to close their positions, and the prices were immediately suppressed to the previous closing level. Although various stocks were maintained throughout the day, there was nothing characteristic to say. If there is good news, the market's upward responsiveness will be very difficult. The current price is still much lower than the high price we have seen.

London, 22nd (Monday) Telegram

Today's listed prices of various Far East British companies' stocks are generally stable. Only the price of the Macquarie Bank stock fell by 2 shillings and 6 pence, and the price was 6 pounds and 1 shilling and 6 pence. The rest are unchanged.

London, 22nd (Monday) Telegram Today's listed prices of Chinese foreign debts are still balanced. There are no changes in the bonds above and below the range.

### Yarn: Although Sales are Clear, Yarn Merchants are Still Optimistic

The futures factory continued to open a batch, and some people's minds were relaxed because of it. Only those who accepted it were optimistic and must have good hopes. The fundamental issue of the future of the market must be whether the actual digestion is strong or not. Yong'an Factory opened 2,000 pieces of Jincheng and 100 bales, and the price was 810 yuan.

The current yarn market opened in the morning due to good Naxon, and people hoped to rise. All colleagues had positions in their hands, and they were very happy to rise. They unanimously shouted higher, and 20 counts became 935 yuan. A certain bull was about to buy dozens of bales, so the popularity suddenly became enthusiastic and the buying momentum was surging, rising to 943 yuan. However, customer sales were still dim and dull, and there was a general trend of grabbing hats, shouting to rise, but actually secretly exiting when the price was good. As a result, the actual market was slack, and it once again fell back to 931 yuan. The closing price was 932 yuan. The statistics of transactions in the morning and half a day were 250 bales ago, and the price of 20 counts rose by 4 yuan. Shenxin No. 9 Factory reopened 20 counts of Shuangma with 400 bales, and the price and deadline were the same as the previous day. Dingyang received 150 yuan per bale, and Wu Ji received 110 yuan the previous day. The attached material is correct. Today, 1,035 pieces of yarn were shipped to Hong Kong. The amount of purchases by each gang is listed as follows:

Hong Kong 185 Fellow Traders 1,00 Yunnan 40

Wenzhou 30 Total 1,25

### Cotton Mill Demand Still Weak

Spot transactions are still few, and mills' acceptance is narrow, due to sluggish yarn sales. Only sales between dealers to cover short positions are slightly embellishing the market. Tongzhou Hua Qingxiang entered 164 bales, priced at 171 yuan. Dealers entered 130 bales of fire-engine-branded grass-packed cotton, priced between 142 and 152 yuan. All are machine-processed.

Another report on cotton market prices: The New York cotton market has been unusually quiet lately. All parties are adopting a wait-and-see attitude. Real transactions are also quite mediocre. The weather in the cotton-growing areas is good, and as a result, yesterday's closing prices fell by two or three points compared to the previous day. India's forecast yesterday predicted an increase of three rupees.

Shanghai's foreign cotton trade was exceptionally quiet all day. Mills' intake was weak. Inventory is still considered abundant, unlike the Japanese mills' meager stocks. There is a large supply at the bottom of the market. The current cotton price is unlikely to fall further, so dealers' intentions are quite firm.

### Fixed Price: Cloth Prices Have Fallen to Within Cost, Leading to Selective Purchases

Domestic Cloth: The cloth market is stagnant and shows no sign of improvement. However, cloth prices have fallen within cost, and manufacturers are reducing production daily. Therefore, general holders are quite tight with their holdings. There is a wide gap in the market by about 2 jiao and a half. Yesterday's actual sales were still lackluster. However, conditions in eastern Zhejiang are stabilizing. The Fengyu Gang and the main street's various wide-range shops absorbed some goods, leading to a slight market rebound. White cloth prices have become more stable. The Mujie market saw transactions of over 300 pieces of white cloth for bleaching and dyeing, nearly 200 pieces of colored cloth, fine cloth, and twill from the Hong Kong Gang, over 100 pieces of colored cloth and twill from the Intermediary Gang, and 70 to 80 pieces of fine cloth and twill from the Helping Gang.

Eastern Cloth: The market is languishing. Mid-range fine cloth and fine twill continue to decline due to sluggish actual sales, losing another 2.5 to 5 jiao per piece. However, transactions in Dragon Head fine cloth and Four Gentlemen Bi Ji are quiet in the main street's mental state exchange. Therefore, the market shows little movement. Dragon Head's new stack orders are still selling for 28 yuan and 45 jiao, with older stack orders falling by 1 yuan per piece. Bi Ji fluctuates between 8 jiao 5 fen and 5 fen 2.5 li.

Exports: 205 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong today, 200 pieces to Tianjin, and 500 pieces to Yantai.

### Grains: Rice Prices Rebound Slightly as Arrivals and Inventory are Both Strong

Yesterday, when the foreign rice market first opened, customer offers were still high, and the situation seemed tight. For example, the Huowen Association bid 57 yuan. However, the general customers felt this was difficult to handle and their buying interest waned. Not only was this the case for shops on the main street, but also customers in inland villages who were transporting rice inland felt it was difficult to profit. Seeing that sales were not good, and pressured by the congestion of incoming goods, speculators were willing to sell their goods at a discount. Prices for all types of rice retreated, and the entire market declined together, falling by half a yuan or so compared to the previous market. The closing prices were: No. 1 Chen Saigon, 56 yuan 2 jiao, 56 yuan; New Pointed, 55 and a half, 55 yuan 3 jiao; No. 2 Chen Pointed, 53 yuan and a half, 53 yuan; New Pointed, 52 yuan and a half, 52 yuan; No. 1 Patrol, 56 yuan, 55 yuan 8 jiao; No. 2, 52 yuan, 51 yuan 8 jiao; Huowen, 55 yuan and a half, 55 yuan 2 jiao; No. 1 Hong Kong Pointed, 55 yuan, 54 yuan 8 jiao; No. 2, 52 yuan, 51 yuan 4 jiao; Small School Pointed, 54 yuan, 53 yuan and a half; Tokyo Master Pointed, 49 yuan and a half; Secondary to 46 yuan and a half; Rough Pointed, 43-44 yuan; Broken Pointed, 43 yuan, 42 yuan and a half, secondary 41 yuan; Rice Industry, 44 yuan and a half, 44 yuan.

The foreign rice market yesterday showed that spot rice was initially actively being digested, and the market continued to rise. However, customer demand then slackened, and those who were floating sought to sell, and the market turned weak again. Those recalling the road rice initially had scattered hoarding, selling off as prices rose. No. 2 Patrol Rice, which was loaded on the 26th of last month, opened at a price as low as 61 yuan and a half, a difference of 1 and a half yuan compared to the previous day's highest price of 63 yuan. After the price fell, it was absorbed by short covering and customers who were helping out, rising from 62 yuan to 62 yuan and 8 jiao. However, before the market closed, it was pushed down to 62 yuan by the emergence of long positions. Spot rice for immediate delivery initially opened at 61 yuan and 8 jiao, then rose to 62 yuan. No. 2 Saigon for shipping in the last half of June and the first half of July opened at 60 yuan and 2 jiao. In the end, all were weaker than the previous market. The main reason was that both arrivals and inventory were high, and sales were very slow, making it difficult for the market to improve. Moreover, the 15,000 bags of Parsi rice from the Hangzhou Gang were said to have only issued procurement permits, and transport permits had not yet been signed, making the market even softer. Yesterday, only 4,000 bags of spot rice were transacted. Original bags returned totaled 350 tons. 1,000 bags of foreign rice were also shipped from Taikoo, Hubei to Yantai.

There were no arrivals of japonica and glutinous round rice yesterday. Rumors of transactions in the dark market, because the foreign rice market had weakened, people were all floating, so related arrivals were correspondingly soft. The selling price of all japonica and glutinous rice fell by varying amounts of 4-5 jiao. The Chang Gang's fresh special clear japonica entered the 70 yuan mark again, at 69 yuan and a half, 69 yuan. Special clear japonica was 68 yuan, 67 yuan and a half. Fresh Kun Changzhou japonica was 66-7 yuan, secondary to 62 yuan and a half, 62 yuan. Clear four thin rice was 68 yuan, 67 yuan and 4-5 jiao. Nangang early rice was 62-3 yuan. Baimi Piaoyang Special was 6 jiao. Changdan white yuan was 62-3 yuan, secondary 61 yuan. Hong Kong white yuan was high from 60 yuan, secondary to 57 yuan 3 jiao, it is said.

### Japanese Flour Continues to Decline, Wheat Still Has Good Harvests

Flour: The market trended more weakly yesterday. It was found that the No. 2 flour factory's price still requires 16 yuan. Various factories, because the raw material purchase is difficult, have no intention of mutually intimate milling, and step by step the price is going down. Especially Japanese flour's declining trend is particularly strong. For example, Yuanfeng brand spot, only opened at 14 yuan 1-2 jiao, more than before another 2-3 jiao lower. August-September futures were 2 jiao lower. The main street customers all have purchased, because they covet its low price, in order to supply to the needs of the common people. Other Jinshan brand and Johnson flour, etc., are also all quietly smaller. According to the flour price, during the time when wheat is newly harvested, it is originally seen as small. However, the current environment is different. Therefore, the factory side, once wheat is increased, the factory price will be reduced, it is said.

Wheat: Yesterday, transactions were still quiet. It was found that the production area and Hongkou stored wheat have seen fullness. Only the problem of transporting people into the concession is especially difficult, so the Chinese factories have until now found it difficult to purchase a lot. Every day, no more than one or two thousand bags. The price to pull is about 23 yuan or so. It is heard that the Japanese factories are purchasing a lot, eating the market severely. Comparing with the Chinese factories, the difference is far from 3 yuan. But the cargo owners are still holding on.

### Sugar Market: Strip Green Slightly Falls

The sugar market was tight first, then loose, yesterday. In the end, the ups and downs were few. The association's planned price, spot 24 coarse white cost 68 yuan 7 jiao to 3 jiao. Foreign piers opened at 68 yuan 5 jiao to 2 jiao in the morning, and 68 yuan in the afternoon. Transshipment goods immediately hit the money order for 52 yuan 6 jiao, 30-day delivery was 53 yuan 1 jiao, only small 5 fen to 1 jiao. Taikoo Cart White B Mark was still 78 yuan, Dutch Cotton White was 70 yuan and a half, Dutch Red was 58 yuan 4 jiao. Local factory moldy white and local water had no changes. The domestic sugar had a Guang Gang opening more than a hundred cases of strip green, 44 yuan 5 jiao to 45 yuan and a half, than before, small yuan allowed.

### Sesame Cake: The Price of Peanut Oil Soars

Yesterday, the peanut oil market remained strong. The reason was that various parties were interested in trading, and they felt that soybean oil was too restricted and uninteresting. Therefore, although peanut oil had been rising for three consecutive days, it was still considered suitable, so the general public's desire to buy remained strong. The price rose by another yuan or so. The transactions included 200 pieces of current oil from Jiaozhou, 100 pieces of oil en route, with prices both opening at 62 yuan. There were also 100 pieces of current oil from Yantai, with the price also at 62 yuan, 150 barrels of Qingdao oil, priced at 98 or 99 yuan, and inferior quality oil opening at 76 yuan. There were 50 barrels of Jiangbei local oil, priced at 86 yuan, and 50 barrels of Tianjin oil, also priced at 86 yuan. Since soybean oil’s domestic sales have been restricted, Dalian barrel oil has become a rare commodity, resulting in few sales from foreign firms. The day before yesterday (the 22nd), the general merchants wanted to invigorate the market and threw out 10 barrels, priced at 90 yuan. Although the market was not formal, yesterday the foreign firms released 300 barrels, priced from 90 yuan to 93.5 yuan. In the end, the closing price returned to 93 yuan. Today, 600 units of soybeans are headed to Hong Kong.

### Old News Re-copied: Sixty-Seven Years Ago (454) (See _Shen Bao_ from the Twelfth Year of Tongzhi in the Late Qing Dynasty)

American President's Tour

In ancient times, rulers had the tradition of making inspection tours. As recorded in historical texts, in the second month of the year, the ruler made an eastern tour to Mount Tai; in the fifth month, a southern tour; and in the eleventh month, a northern tour. All of these were done to correct the seasons and months, establish laws, measures, and weights, cultivate etiquette, harmonize music, gather local customs, facilitate communication between superiors and inferiors, and connect the aspirations of the ruler and the people. These were grand events. Later generations, like Qin Shi Huang and Emperor Wu of Han, used tours as a pretext for sightseeing, spending lavishly wherever they went. Wise and enlightened rulers used this as a warning, staying mainly in the capital and rarely venturing out. Consequently, information from below was often blocked from reaching the ears of those above, which was lamented by commentators. There has never been a ruler who, while holding a position of high honor, was so eager to observe customs and inquire about the well-being of the people. Wherever his travels took him, he was greeted with enthusiastic welcomes. He was revered and feared, and no distance was too far to travel, as is the case with the current President of the United States who has come to Shanghai. According to research, the United States is located in the Americas, on the opposite side of the globe from the three continents. Since its opening, it has had little contact with other regions. During the Hongzhi reign of the Ming dynasty, Columbus of Spain discovered the land by large ship. Subsequently, Portugal, England, and France also followed suit, gradually developing the area. Towards the end of the Qianlong reign in our dynasty, Washington raised troops and established an army, expanded territory, and rose up to become independent, without any intention of using the country for selfish purposes. He established a system of recommending successors. The position of president is publicly elected by the people, with each term lasting four years, and a maximum of eight years. This seems to retain the ancient tradition of abdication.

### Husband Loses Money, Wife Falls Ill — A Lesson on the Desire to Hoard and Profit

— Blind Doctor

"Be content with your lot" is an outdated and trite saying. However, upon careful consideration, if everyone could "be content with their lot," without greed or unreasonable desires, they might not become immensely wealthy, but they would also avoid unexpected major storms.

I have a colleague named Zhou, who used to be extremely frugal. He rarely wasted money, even on going to the cinema, and never engaged in speculative businesses. Therefore, although his monthly income was only a hundred yuan, after covering expenses for himself and his wife, he still had fifty yuan left over each month. Over the years, he had accumulated a good sum of money, and he was quite comfortable.

But strangely enough, his attitude suddenly changed this year. Perhaps it was because he heard that someone made tens of thousands by hoarding goods, and another made hundreds of thousands by purchasing goods for profit? So, two months ago, he listened to the encouragement of a friend who said that buying ×× pills and ×× oil would yield the best interest, because they were essential medicines for every household, and there would always be a market for them. Moreover, in his opinion, the prices might rise sharply in the future. Thus, my colleague Zhou, who was known for his prudence, resolutely decided to engage in this speculative business, putting his so-called "hoarding to get rich" plan into action. But alas! Since he bought the goods, the price has gradually fallen, and Zhou's face has also become thinner. Zhou was originally a cautious person. It is difficult to predict how low the price will fall in the future. Moreover, if the goods are not sold, he will be worried every day, unable to sleep or eat properly. So, gritting his teeth, he made a ruthless decision and sold all the goods he had purchased. Heavens! Since he started hoarding, he had worried for more than two months, and his savings from decades of frugality had been reduced by more than half. How could he not feel heartbroken and resentful? What is even more tragic and pitiful is that his wife, Ms. Zhan, is also a diligent and virtuous housewife. She is not only less wasteful than modern women, but she even skips lunch every day (because Zhou's lunch is provided by the company, Ms. Zhan cooks a little extra at dinner time to serve as lunch for the next day to save money). Now, hearing that her husband had lost several thousand yuan for no good reason, she suddenly fell ill due to shock. Although Zhou tried his best to comfort and explain to her, and also hired a doctor to treat her, she has gradually recovered, but her eyebrows are furrowed, and her face has become much thinner! Today, Zhou resolutely told people, "From now on, I will no longer have unrealistic thoughts. As the saying goes, 'Ill-gotten wealth does not enrich the poor,' this is a lesson for me on wanting to hoard goods to get rich."

### About Riddles

— San San

The Great Eastern Advertising Company held two riddle contests, and in my opinion, some of the riddles were inappropriate. I am pointing them out here for experts to consider:

1.  For "artificial silk," "stumble" is not as relevant as the character "統" (unify).
2.  For "Half above, half below, half empty in the middle, half removed, still half left," the answer given is "隨" (follow), but I think it should be "卡" (card).
3.  For "Holding him in your hand, looking at him with your eyes, thinking of him in your heart, is it him or not?" the answer given is "pawn ticket," but I would suggest "photograph."
4.  For "Brother knows it," the answer given is "Kunming," but the riddle would be better if changed to "Brothers competing for military service."

### Thoughts Inspired by "Medicine Residue"

— Lu Yu

After reading Mr. Cao Jian's article "Medicine Residue" in the newspaper on the 19th, I couldn't help but think of those small slips of paper posted on the streets and in the alleys that say "Heaven is yellow, earth is yellow..." and "Selling severe cold..." These things, though rarely seen in more prosperous areas, are still frequently found in the corners of poor villages. Generally speaking, this is the same superstitious habit as throwing away medicine residue. They simply want to have passersby glance at them and take away all the illnesses and disasters that are happening to them. This kind of foolish thinking is really laughable.

In our opinion, this is not worth discussing. How can this idea of shifting misfortune to others have any effect? But in the minds of ordinary foolish men and women, it is like a Taoist's incantation. These few words contain boundless magic power and generate great hope.

From a moral point of view, if you are sick, you should seek medical treatment instead of pushing it onto others regardless of the consequences. What a selfish and self-serving thought! You want to get better while hoping that others get sick. Regardless of whether this kind of thinking has any effect, having this kind of mentality in your heart is probably ten times worse than the disease of "cold" or "night crying."

This kind of mentality is very prevalent among the people of our country. It is even more hateful and unacceptable than "everyone sweeps the snow from their own doorstep." Regarding this point, I hope that we can all practice the virtue of "Do not do unto others what you do not want done unto yourself" from the ancient sages. Don't do things that harm others and do not benefit yourself.

Amateur Musings

### Talking About Apprentices

— Shi Wei

The apprentices discussed here naturally refer to those old-fashioned shop apprentices.

Speaking of this issue, many people will say in unison: this system cannot continue, because it is a matter of the future of young people, and it is also a matter of national strength.

Yes, no one can count how many promising young people have had their futures buried under the apprenticeship system over the past thousands of years.

Regarding the life of apprentices, I think many people must know it. This article only intends to point out the following comprehensively:

1.  Academics—is an empty phrase. All day long, what you do is wipe the display windows, pour tea, serve food, and even carry children and empty chamber pots... It takes two or three years to learn the basics of doing business.
2.  Remuneration—is simply equal to zero. What is given is one yuan, or two or three yuan per month. With soaring prices, a haircut, a tube of toothpaste, and a towel are already gone.
3.  Leisure life—is non-existent, because there is simply no free time. From five or six o'clock in the morning to eleven or twelve o'clock at night, you have to work for the shop. If you happen to steal time to flip through the newspaper, you will be scolded as a "lazybones," but washing water pipes, or waiting at the door on cold winter nights, is considered appropriate.

What kind of people are nurtured in this environment? The facts tell us: most of them are depressed, selfish, profit-oriented, and especially lack a national and ethnic concept.

Undeniably, this system, if it continues, is definitely not a blessing for the country and society!

But some people say: "One must endure the bitterest of the bitter to become a superior person." When young people jump into society, they always have to learn first!

We say: It is necessary to endure hardship, and this is a virtue. But enduring hardship must be meaningful and reasonable; to be familiar with a certain business, to complete a certain task, it is indeed necessary to show a spirit of hard work, because otherwise, you will not be able to achieve the goal; but this cannot be interpreted as physical labor from morning to night—thus causing these apprentices who are in their developmental stage to become sallow and thin.

Learning is necessary, but it must be useful; pouring tea, serving food... do you still need to learn?

Today, there are some old gentlemen who have also been apprentices, and they have also shed tears in the still of the night, sighing: "My parents gave me life." But when they themselves become bosses today, they inflict the pain they suffered in the past on later generations.

But there is still progress. Some apprentices are intensifying their studies in difficult environments; some managers and bosses are improving the lives of apprentices. (For example, doctors pay to send apprentices to the Hudong Commune...) But this is still a minority!

Let us speak up for the apprentices! Because———

Cultivating one more healthy young person is to preserve one more point of vitality for the country.

### Thoughts, Sights, and Sounds

Recently, various employment agencies are also overcrowded, and there are two reasons for this: one is because of the rice shortage in eastern Zhejiang, and rural women are coming to Shanghai to work as maids; the second is because of soaring prices, and middle-class families also have to make calculations to make ends meet. In order to save expenses, they have to make some layoffs and tighten their belts. According to a friend's calculation, employing a servant requires more than forty yuan more per month. Including wages of five yuan, food expenses of twenty-five yuan, and extra income (including stealing while buying things...), ten yuan, so in order to save money, servants are really unaffordable, so even employment agencies are "overcrowded":
— Wei Kang

Walking along Changsha Road, I saw a row of rice shops. On the counter inside the shop, there was a white lacquered sign with the four large black characters "金珠玉粒" (Golden Pearls and Jade Grains), as if grinning mockingly at the poor!

Hawthorne Investigates

### The Dancer's Ending

Chapter 3: Conflicting Information

"How were you able to enter the room? Did you have a key to the room?"

"No, the room wasn't locked. Miss Wang wanted Jinmei to go in and clean the room, so she often didn't lock the room when she went out."

"After that, you went out to find Manager Lu and Miss Jiang?"

"Yes. I couldn't get through to Jinmei's phone, so I went to the Happy Dance Hall to find Miss Jiang, but I didn't see her. They told me that she had accompanied a dance customer to the Celestial Palace. I rushed to the Celestial Palace, but I missed her again. My legs were sore, and I finally found Miss Jiang at the Guangming Dance Hall. When she heard the news, she insisted that we should first report to Manager Lu. Since Manager Lu hadn't gone home, she guessed that he was gambling in some hotel, so she accompanied me to several hotels, but we couldn't find him. Then I accompanied Miss Jiang back. By that time, it was already dawn."

Hawthorne stood up, stretched, and waved his hand to Old Mao, "Alright, go back to the gatehouse. If there's anything else, I'll call you again."

Old Mao nodded and stole a glance at Inspector Ni, seeing that there was no reaction, he immediately turned around and walked out.

Ni Jinshou also stood up and said to Hawthorne, "Three of the four people in this house have been questioned. There is still one old woman, Wu Ma, left. Perhaps she has more important information. Do you want me to call her in?"

Hawthorne nodded. Ni Jinshou walked out of the reception room. Hawthorne walked to the low steel bar window and stood still. He wanted to absorb some fresh air, but his eyes were fixed on the thin rosebush trembling in the sunlight outside the window. His eyebrows were also tightly furrowed, showing that he was racking his brains over this difficult problem. (54)

Amusements World

After the Sudden Change in the European Situation

### Hollywood Severely Affected

— Jing Yuan

After the sudden change in the European war situation, Hollywood has also been severely affected. Recently, Douglas W. Churchill wrote an article in the New York Times, stating: "Due to the changes in the European war, most of the people are concerned about current affairs, which has greatly affected the business of cinemas, and the shrinking of overseas markets has made the film companies that produced blockbuster films this year panic."

Due to the changes in the European situation, Hollywood filmmakers have been formulating countermeasures for the future. Among them, there are two factions, each adhering to one argument, arguing fiercely. One faction advocates increasing the wholesale price of films while reducing the salaries of film stars. Only those with a weekly salary of no more than 500 US dollars can sign long-term contracts. The other faction believes that the best remedy is to save production costs, and the cutting costs, which are time-consuming and expensive, must also be reduced as much as possible.

Warner, RKO, Paramount, and Universal Pictures do not adopt the above two strategies. 20th Century Fox has laid off 350 employees to reduce the burden, and MGM has laid off at least 250 small supporting actors and staff.

Due to the continuation of the war, the production of films will also be reduced by at least 25%. MGM's production budget for 1940-41 originally planned to shoot 52 feature films, but recently it also announced the abandonment of 12 films. The purpose is of course to save money.

At the beginning of the European war, some people advocated abandoning the filming of B-grade films. This proposal is no longer applicable. According to the observations of famous filmmakers, in the second half of this year, the output of B-grade films will be reduced by at least half.

Warner and MGM ordered all radios installed in the studio or dressing room to be removed, and Warner posted a notice in the studio declaring that no one should talk about anything related to Germany in the studio.

Some people predict that the continuation of the European war will cause Hollywood to enter a recession. Forty percent of the people in the film city area rely directly or indirectly on the film industry for their livelihoods, and it is feared that it will lead to the tragedy of unemployment.

### China United Film Company Expands Its Territory

— Feng Ling

In recent years, the China United Film Company has emerged on a large scale, undoubtedly enough to manipulate the entire silver screen. Under its jurisdiction, there are the Xinhua, Huacheng, and Huaxin factories. At that time, it owned the Dingxiang Garden, the Hualian General Factory in Xujiahui, and the Mingxing Second Factory on Albert Road. Later, the Albert Road factory was taken back and rebuilt by the landlord, and Hualian was also leased by Hezhong and Minhua. Therefore, the China United Film Company focused on working in the Dingxiang Garden.

The area of the Dingxiang Garden is indeed very large, but due to the intensity of the work, such as the joint production of ten folk films this time, it feels insufficient to manage. Therefore, the China United Film Company is planning how to expand.

At present, in addition to developing in the Yihua Studio in a cooperative manner, and continuing to rent a part of the Hualian General Factory, the China United Film Company has also rented a large open space on Fukaissen Road and Jules Road. The area is near the northwest corner of the Dingxiang Garden, covering a total area of two mu and three fen, and the property belongs to the Shanghai Bank.

The gate of the Dingxiang Garden is on Haig Road. Now the China United Film Company intends to open up this open space and build the gate on Fukaissen Road. At the same time, it plans to build a new studio at the original gate.

As for the date of commencement of construction, it will be after all ten folk films have been completed. In the near future, the China United Film Company will be焕然一新 (huanran yixin –take on a completely new look).

### Careless Talk Causes Trouble

— Hua Zhi

Since Britain joined the European war, women, like men, have also made great contributions to the country; but they have a common problem, which is that they like to discuss national defense secrets wantonly, which is very dangerous, because this kind of empty talk is used by the "Fifth Column," which is often very detrimental to the military affairs of the country.

In order to make women across the country understand the example of reckless talk causing trouble and tongues causing the loss of the country, the British Intelligence Department recently filmed three educational films, which are being screened in more than 2,000 cinemas across the country. The names of the three films are: "Mobilization of All Members Brings Disaster from the Mouth" and "A Record of Careless Talk Causing Trouble." The content of the last film narrates that an air force general accidentally told a woman about air defense secrets, and she inadvertently revealed it to others, which was discovered by the enemy, resulting in great danger. The film was watched by 20 million people, and many women who were usually careless in their words have become silent after watching the film.

Travel Musings on the Arts

### Appreciating Music

— Xiao Tian

Gathering words into phrases, connecting them with tunes, and regulating them with beats is called music. As the saying goes, if the music is wrong, Zhou Lang turns his head. This means that if it is not wrong, he will just listen quietly, but if it is wrong, he will turn his head to correct it. I once saw an ancient painting depicting Zhou Lang wearing a crown and belt, sitting cross-legged in the middle, surrounded by a group of concubines. Shens, pipas, and flutes were played together. One concubine held a clapper and stood on the side, and another concubine held nothing, her mouth slightly open, as if she was a singer. Judging by the intention, it was probably Kunqu opera. However, the meaning of appreciating music now, the so-called music, is definitely not specifically referring to Kunqu opera. All songs of Ping, Han, Hui, Yue, Xiang, Qin, Min, Shao, and other dramas are music; Suzhou Tanhuang, Shanghai opera, storytelling, and big drum are all music; and all local songs are music, even new songs accompanied by Western music are also music. The so-called appreciating means gracing with a visit. Therefore, the meaning of appreciating music can be interpreted as listening to songs, or it can be interpreted as watching dramas.

Yue opera star Little Baiyu Meiz is the beloved daughter of the famous predecessor Baiyu Meiz. She is beautiful, talented, studious, and has inherited the family tradition. She is even better than her predecessor. Her voice is like a string of pearls, and she has captivated countless customers. After coming to Shanghai, she has been a pillar of the Yue opera stage at the New World for many years. Recently, she was hired by the Tianxiang Grand Theater with a large sum of money and is scheduled to perform on stage on July 1st of the lunar calendar. This time, the Shaoxing Pingtiao Donation and Fundraising Committee is hosting a grand Yue opera performance with eight women's Yue opera troupes. She should accept the invitation of the hosts Huang Yuzhai and Wei Jinshan to perform as a charity, with Ma Zhanghua, Li Yanfang, and others performing on the same stage. The peony and green leaves will give the audience a feast for the eyes.

Female Laosheng (old male role) performer Qin Bijun was recently hired by Singapore and is scheduled to depart from Shanghai on the Taisheng Wheel today for a distant expedition. Qin Ling is a top student of the veteran performer Zhao Yunbi. She has performed on various stages over the years, and her artistry has long been praised by connoisseurs. She is capable of performing many plays. As she is about to embark on her journey, she specially broadcasted the excerpt "Zhu Lian Village" at the Xindu Glass Radio Station at the request of her friends in Shanghai to mark her departure, which was well received by the audience. Famous performer Chen Hefeng recently recomposed the entire "Chasing Han Xin" for Bijun to prepare for performances in Singapore.

### Anecdotes from the Longevity Pot

Watching Tan Fuying and Chen Lifang Perform Together

Tan Fuying has been performing at the Xinxing Theater for half a month. The weather is hot, and both the actors and the audience feel tired. He took a three-day break starting from the 17th and then returned to the stage. Therefore, on the night of the 16th, he and Dan (female role) Chen Lifang performed the double excerpts "Sangyuan Hui" (Meeting in the Mulberry Garden) and "Dayu Shajia" (Killing the Family with Fishing Rods) to gather momentum. It is commonplace for pillar performers and famous actors to perform double excerpts. It is a great fortune for the audience to see them perform double excerpts and still be able to concentrate and show strength that is different from usual. I was invited by Mr. Wu that day and was able to watch both excerpts. After watching, I wrote this to express my joy. I am not encouraging famous actors to often perform variable excerpts. When famous actors perform double excerpts, it is like the army launching a surprise attack, marching quickly with muffled drums, and advancing at double speed. It is okay to do it occasionally, but if it is done continuously, it is like a weak horse carrying a heavy load on a long road, only seeing its tendons stretched and struggling to survive. Those who are cunning will inevitably reduce the amount of work and perfunctorily tell the story and then be done with it. Therefore, listening to opera is not about the number of excerpts, but about the quality of the performance. As the saying goes, "It is better to eat one good peach than a basket of rotten peaches." This is what it means. Today, Fuying and others occasionally perform double excerpts, and they actually put in a lot of effort and do not slack off at all. This is exactly the surprise attack that is occasionally launched, and it can also prove that they actually have long-term strength and can further invigorate their spirits and work hard to research and return to the path of energetic and flavorful singing and performance. Isn't this a happy thing? If the singing and performance of famous Laosheng is energetic and flavorful, then performing the "Three Kingdoms" epic, from "Fancheng," "Changting," "Zhaoguan," and "Huansha," to "Yu Chang Sword Assassinating Liao," is also possible; if not, then singing "Xue Bei Yuan" or "San Niang Teaches Her Son" is also possible. Listening to opera is about exquisiteness, not quantity; it is about flavor, not length; the length and quantity of the opera are not worth mentioning! Enough of the idle talk, I will now describe the content of listening to the opera this evening.

I arrived early and was able to see the second excerpt, "Shuang Yao Hui," performed by Huadan (young female role) Ji Yanfen and others. The wives and concubines in the room solve the order of the evening by rolling dice. There is this emotion but no such thing. This is a playful little play. Ji Yanfen's whole body movements are in line with the Huadan requirements. I don't know why she hasn't become popular? Jiang Miaoxiang, Ye Shengmao, and others performed "Yuanmen Shooting Battle." Miaoxiang is extremely gentle in private, but when he gets on stage, he likes to work hard, as if he is two different people. It can be called an interesting thing. (To be continued)
