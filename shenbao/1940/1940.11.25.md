### Unpredictable Changes in the Far East Situation: President Roosevelt Responds Accordingly, Intensifying Steps to Aid Britain Under Discussion; American Reporter Discusses the Chaotic Japanese Political Situation

Washington - At yesterday's press conference, President Roosevelt was asked about the possibility of an incident occurring in the Far East and whether the United States would maintain the status quo. The President stated that no one could speculate on such matters hours in advance. A reporter then inquired about Roosevelt's recent discussions with Lord Lothian, Chairman of the British Defense Purchasing Commission. Roosevelt replied that he would discuss Lothian's future activities. The reporter further inquired about the nature of Lothian's activities, but the President declined to answer, directing the questioner to inquire directly with Lothian. The President also stated that he had not discussed the possibility of the United States providing further destroyer aid to Britain with Lothian. (United Press dispatch, 22nd)

Washington - Today's newspapers published remarks by Mr. Fleisher, former editor of the Japan Advertiser, regarding the domestic situation in Japan. He stated that there are significant divisions of opinion in Japan regarding domestic and foreign policy, and that revolutions, riots, and assassinations have occurred repeatedly in recent years. He believes that such actions are likely to continue. On July 5th, Japanese police arrested 38 warriors claiming to be sent by Heaven, because they were plotting to assassinate Admiral Yonai and Count Matsudaira. It is rumored that the mastermind behind this plot was Colonel Hashimoto, who was responsible for shelling the British gunboat "Ladybird" in the Yangtze River in December 1937. There is no possibility of Japan restoring liberalism in the short term. Japanese liberals are currently in hiding. Japanese policy depends on the European war. If Germany wins, Japan will inevitably move towards Nazism. If Britain wins, Japan will adopt a more cautious policy. In July, Konoe ascended to power in a bloodless revolution, but internal conflicts among extremist factions continue to make Konoe's position difficult. The extremist factions are divided into those who support the Emperor as a dictator and those who advocate direct dictatorship with the Emperor as a figurehead. Opinions on foreign policy are even more divided. The Axis alliance is not welcomed by the public, and the government was forced to delay national celebrations until the 2600th anniversary of the founding of the nation, when they were held jointly nationwide. The Konoe government is currently eager to draw the Soviet Union into the alliance, and is therefore negotiating a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union. Germany seems to have guaranteed Japan that the Soviet Union will not attack Japan in the event of a conflict in the Pacific, and Japan is eager to see this guarantee realized.

### Japan's Only Elder Statesman, Saionji, Passes Away; Aged 92

Tokyo - According to a semi-official Japanese source, Japan's last elder statesman, Prince Kinmochi Saionji, passed away tonight after several days of illness, at the age of 92. Born into an aristocratic family, he was born in Kyoto in October 1849. In 1867, when the Meiji Restoration restored power from the shogunate, he was not yet 20 years old, but he was already involved in national affairs. He once led troops to suppress the remnants of the shogunate, and was appointed to an important position after the pacification, but he resigned to pursue knowledge and went to France to study law and politics. He returned to Japan in 1880 and founded Meiji University and Women's University, and published a newspaper. In 1882, he accompanied Hirobumi Ito to Europe and the United States to investigate the parliamentary system. In 1885, he was appointed as the Minister to Vienna, and three years later he was transferred to Berlin. In 1894, he joined the cabinet as Minister of Education, and in 1898 he was reappointed as Foreign Minister. In 1900, he succeeded Ito as Acting Prime Minister, and then formed cabinets twice. He served as President of the Seiyukai party from 1903 to 1914, after which he retired and did not actively participate in politics. In 1918, when the Terauchi Cabinet collapsed, he was ordered to form a cabinet, but he declined and recommended Hara Takashi as his replacement. In 1918, when World War I ended, he led the Japanese delegation to the Versailles Peace Conference. The following year, he returned to Japan and was recognized as one of the elder statesmen. Since then, he has retired to his villa in the countryside, offering advice to the government. (Reuters dispatch, [Number missing]th)

Editorial

### The Dead End of Japanese Diplomacy

Enumerating the various failures of Japan today, diplomacy must be considered the most prominent. In the three years of war, Japan has changed foreign ministers seven or eight times, and as a result, the cabinet has collapsed two or three times. In terms of policy, almost all lines and diplomatic terms have been tried one by one, but with very little success. The only major achievement has been the conclusion of the Tripartite Pact (now it should be the Quintuple Pact!). Not only has Japan's international standing not improved, but it has deteriorated, entering an unprecedentedly difficult situation. Compared to any wartime country, this is almost unparalleled, and in Japanese history, this can be considered an unprecedented phenomenon. In the past two months, since Konoe's provocative remarks against the United States, he has avoided this issue and remained silent. Matsuoka's Ministry of Foreign Affairs can only soothe American resentment and appease Japanese anxiety. Not only is the so-called "revolutionary diplomacy" a mere empty slogan, but the ambitions and adjustments to the diplomatic lineup that he talked about at the beginning of his tenure have not materialized. Diplomacy with the United States is now close to being stranded, and Kichisaburo Nomura seems to lack the interest and courage to serve as ambassador to the United States. Kensuke Horinouchi, who rushed to Moscow after the Tripartite Pact was signed, has not made any progress in negotiating a non-aggression pact after more than a month. The Tripartite Pact has severed the last bit of friendship between Japan and Britain and the United States. On the other hand, Germany and Italy themselves are of no help to Japan. Are Hungary and Romania, the two allied countries that Germany has pulled in for Japan, merely allies on paper? As for the "resolution of the China Incident" and the Southern Advance policy, which are fundamental national policies of Japan, Matsuoka bears the greatest responsibility, but in reality, neither the peaceful offensive nor economic negotiations have achieved the desired results. The recent Imperial Conference and Privy Council meetings convened by the Japanese government may have made new decisions on this, but it is unlikely that they will fundamentally alleviate the major difficulties. Looking at Matsuoka recently, he is calm and prudent, quite different from when he was actively pursuing the wishes of the military and withdrew from the League of Nations in Geneva. This is his transformation. At the same time, it also shows his bitterness.

Japan's diplomatic difficulties are so great today, but in the past, there was a brilliant page: in both the Sino-Japanese War and the Russo-Japanese War, Japan benefited from good diplomatic maneuvering, and the Anglo-Japanese Alliance laid the foundation for Japan's dominance in the Far East. After the Russo-Japanese War, Japan concluded agreements with France and Russia one after another, obtaining an understanding of its sphere of influence in the Asian continent. During World War I, it secretly allied itself with Britain and France, and concluded the Lansing-Ishii Agreement with the United States, thus acquiring several major rights and interests in China and the Pacific. These can all be considered diplomatic victories for Japan. Japan's leap from a semi-colonial status to a first-class power, in addition to the victory of foreign wars and the development of the economy and industry, diplomacy was an important key. Without the achievements of foreign operations, its foreign wars and industrial development would inevitably encounter obstacles, and whether it could quickly become rich and strong is still questionable. However, that golden age has passed. The current Japanese diplomatic lineup may not be comparable to the likes of Okuma, Mutsu, Hayashi, and Kato, but in recent years, the leading figures have included the political wanderer Ugaki, the American friend Nomura, the conservative Arita Sato, the pro-military Matsuoka Shiratori, and the former Prime Minister Hirota, who was somewhere in between. From the army to the navy, from the old faction to the new faction, almost all have been tried one by one. Their lack of achievement is exactly the same. Obviously, the central problem here is not about the strength or weakness of talent.

Although history is not without precedents of diplomacy saving countries from danger, diplomacy is ultimately only one link in the overall political picture, and its application cannot be independent of the entire national destiny. The conditions for Japanese diplomacy today are not necessarily worse than its military, political, and economic conditions, but because its hopes are too extravagant, its failure is also the most miserable. They fantasize that diplomacy can save the military and political situation, but they lack a position, do not speak of good faith, and only engage in speculation and opportunism, with the closeness or distance to the great powers based only on temporary, one-sided interests. Diplomacy like this would be difficult to succeed in any era, but the focus here is not entirely on diplomacy itself, but rather on Japan's entire national policy. Examining the words and actions of the Japanese government over the past ten years, it is not difficult to find that they are disjointed and wavering, and that there are contradictions. The reflection of this in major foreign actions is that they suffer from unclear goals and change their minds. Diplomacy cannot be an exception to this. The fact that Konoe has taken the stage again is already the last gasp of Japanese imperialism. Matsuoka's task is naturally more difficult than before. If he had been calm and pragmatic from the beginning of his tenure, and did not make hasty changes, he might not have been able to help much, but he would not have encountered greater failures than his predecessors. However, he was in a hurry to choose, and vainly tried to take a chance by concluding the Tripartite Pact. At the same time, he was hampered by national strength and circumstances, and could not immediately make a 180-degree turn in national policy to take risks and advance rapidly, but still had to maintain a small, albeit uneasy, attitude. Waiting for extraordinary changes in the international situation to occur, so as to obtain major gains at a small cost. However, his assessment of the international situation, from the European war to his attitude towards China, the United States, and the Soviet Union, is completely contrary to the facts. Although the reaction of Britain and the United States is still somewhat slow, Japan's situation has fallen into a dilemma, turning from side to side with difficulty. This situation is entirely the result of the Japanese authorities' own actions.

Now Japan's southern advance is like an arrow on the string, the war of aggression against China has not yet been settled, relations with Britain and the United States have reached a dead end, and there have been no gains in diplomacy with the Soviet Union or with the Axis powers. This is a desperate situation for Japanese diplomacy, and also a great crisis for its entire national destiny.

Berlin - The "German Foreign Policy Correspondence" published an article yesterday welcoming Romania's accession to the Tripartite Pact, stating that Romania had previously become a victim of British conspiracies, but now has changed its course and resumed cooperation with European countries. Under the leadership of Antonescu, Romania has regained its interests in Europe. The Axis powers will be able to guarantee Romania's legitimate status. The new European order cannot be achieved at the roundtable conference. The failure of Geneva can serve as a lesson. It requires a period of struggle to be realized. Britain's starvation blockade policy on the continent has created a sense of solidarity in Europe. The Tripartite Pact has had the effect of mutual dependence among European nations and will unite to deal with the enemies of the continent. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 24th)

Rome - Italian people have long known that Romania will join the Tripartite Pact, so the news did not cause excitement among the people here, but everyone was happy because Italy often regards Romania as one of its Latin sisters. Italian newspapers all described this matter on the front page, believing that this is a victory for the Axis powers. A famous Italian journalist commented in "Italian News" that the policies of the Axis powers and the Tripartite Pact have now expanded their influence to the shores of the Black Sea. On the contrary, Britain's position has become increasingly isolated. For example, the British government's protests to Sweden, Finland, Belgium, Romania, the Soviet Union, and Japan have not received a response. According to Hungarian newspapers, Bulgaria will also join the Tripartite Pact. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 24th)

Berlin - German newspapers this morning all carried accounts of the four major political events of last week, namely, the visits of the Italian and Spanish Foreign Ministers to Berlin and the successive accessions of Hungary and Romania to the Tripartite Pact. The "German General Report" stated that within these ten days, two more European countries have joined the Tripartite Alliance. Romania's adherence to the Tripartite Pact is not only a symbol of purging Romania's past politics, but also a sign of Romania's determination to help build a new European order. After Romania joined the Tripartite Pact, it has now accepted the basic belief of European peace. The "Berlin Local Daily" stated that the major nations of the world are now undergoing a large-scale reorganization process, and no one can deny the fact that a new era is gradually approaching. In the future, all countries can obtain security that they could not obtain before. All those who have safely reached new lands after this revolutionary crisis are confident in the future. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 24th)

Berlin - The German Foreign Ministry mouthpiece, the "German General Report," stated that Slovakia's participation in the German-Italian-Japanese Tripartite Pact is clear evidence of supporting the new order. The Slovak people, under the leadership of Hlinka, stubbornly fought against the oppressive democratic government that was not Czech. Now Slovakia has become independent with the help of Germany and joined the Tripartite Pact, expressing its determination to cooperate in building Europe. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 24th)

Istanbul - Turkish authorities told reporters that the declaration of martial law in various parts of Turkey is not due to any special event, but is part of the ordinary national defense measures under the current circumstances. Turkey is still determined to avoid being drawn into the vortex of war unless attacked or threatened. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 24th)

Sofia - Sofia is very surprised by Turkey's declaration of martial law in the Thracian province and the straits area. Political circles in Sofia stated that Bulgaria has not taken any measures that would cause Turkey to declare martial law. Relations between the two countries have been very friendly since the signing of the treaty in 1925. Therefore, Bulgaria has also had to take necessary precautions on the border, but believes that Turkey's measures will not lead to serious consequences. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 24th)

### Greek Troops Advance in Rain and Snow, Intensifying Siege of Italian Army's Left Flank; Rumor of Italian Army Abandoning Pogradec

Athens: The Greek High Command announced today that Greek troops along the 120-mile front on the Greek-Albanian border continued to advance last night despite rain and snow. It is claimed that the Greek army's pincer movement is poised to encircle the northern and southern ends of the Italian army's shattered line. While the bad weather minimized air force activity, Greek troops encircling the Italian army's left flank took the opportunity to tighten their encirclement. It is rumored that the Italian army has withdrawn a portion of its forces from Santi Quaranta, a major port in Albania. It is also claimed that Argyrokastron is about to surrender. Two divisions of the Italian army, numbering 30,000, failed to defend Argyrokastron and retreated north, reportedly falling into the jaws of the Greek army's pincer movement. The Greek army is now redoubling its efforts to annihilate this besieged Italian garrison. Greek snipers and search parties are currently pressing the Italian army into a state of siege. However, the Greek communique admits that Italian warships shelled the Greek island of Samos yesterday, reportedly causing minor damage. It is reported that the Greek army is continuing its advance along the entire front, capturing large quantities of military supplies for its own use. Meanwhile, according to news reaching here today, a mutiny broke out among Albanian troops near Larisa, resulting in the deaths of two Italian officers and thirty soldiers, after which they joined the Greek army. It is also reported that General Papagos, accompanied by his staff, triumphantly entered Korçë, which had been captured by the Greek army. (24th International Telegram)

Athens: The Greek army's fierce advance in the general offensive is increasing, causing new threats to the northern and southern ends of the Italian army's fragmented line in Albania this morning. It is rumored that the Italian army is now withdrawing from Santi Quaranta, an important seaport in southern Albania. The loss of this city will isolate the Italian forces in the south by sea. It is rumored that two Italian divisions, totaling 30,000 men, are surrounded near Argyrokastron, cutting off their retreat to the north. Argyrokastron itself, the main base of Italian power in Epirus, is in even greater danger. Authoritative sources here claim that the city's fall is only a matter of time. It is reported that the Greek army has launched a fierce hand-to-hand battle from Delvinë, while also dispatching troops across the Libohovë to monitor the flanks of Argyrokastron, thus placing the city in imminent danger. Yesterday evening, an Italian naval aircraft bombed several districts of Corfu, but there were no casualties. (24th International Telegram)

London: Yesterday's "Exchange Telegraph" Athens dispatch stated that the Italian army is rumored to have abandoned Pogradec in Kopania to form a line of defense south of Elbasan along the Kamby River to resist the Greek army. (24th United Press)

Yugoslav Capital: According to unconfirmed Greek sources here yesterday, Greek troops have entered Pogradec in Albania. This news has not been confirmed by United Press border sources. (24th United Press)

Athens: A local communique declared that the Greek island of Samos in the Aegean Sea was shelled by four Italian destroyers last night, totaling more than seventy rounds, but resulting in no damage whatsoever. It is believed that the ships sailed from Leros. Corfu was also bombed by Italian aircraft and strafed with machine-gun fire, fortunately without damage or casualties. (24th Reuters)

Italian Army Constructs New Positions Northwest of Korçë

Belgrade: According to local reports, there were no major battles on the Greek-Italian front yesterday. The Italian army has constructed new positions northwest and west of Korçë, making it difficult for the Greek army. It is expected that the Italian army will soon launch a counter-offensive. The Italian army's right flank has concentrated a large force and is poised to attack. There was heavy snow and thick fog on the front on Friday, preventing both sides' air forces from operating. (24th Huitong Telegram)

Budapest: News reaching here this morning stated that the Greek army's general advance northward after the fall of Korçë was temporarily halted by the Italian army last night. The news also stated that large reinforcements of Italian troops are now arriving in the northern Albanian theater of war, and a major Italian offensive is expected next week. (24th International Telegram)

Rome: According to the Italian Army Headquarters, the Italian army on the Greek front is continuing to move according to plan. Greek attempts to hinder this movement have been unsuccessful. A British aircraft was shot down and destroyed near Tallaria on our coast. Italian aircraft encountered British aircraft over Malta, shooting down six British aircraft. Italian aircraft bombed Mika Bar and Halfa airfield, dropping multiple bombs. All Italian aircraft returned. Italian aircraft bombed a British ship near the island of Samos in the Aegean Sea, causing it to catch fire. Italian light warships struck a British speedboat and mine-laying boat. All Italian ships returned safely. On the East African front, a British tank column attacked Ilgalo in Kenya and was repulsed. Italian fighter planes shot down a reconnaissance plane over Kisumu, and the pilot was captured. British aircraft dropped bombs near Ta Kamir without causing damage. British aircraft launched a night raid on Turin and Reggio Calabria, dropping flares, incendiary bombs, and explosive bombs, without casualties or damage. (24th Huitong Telegram)

Two Italian Divisions Routed Across the Devol River

Athens: The Italian army, which was jointly bombed by Greek and British aircraft and trapped by Greek cavalry, was driven out of the Kamia Plateau behind Korçë yesterday. The troops commanded by Italian Army Ministry official General Sosso have reportedly not launched a counter-offensive against the advancing Greek army. It is reported that the Greek army is proceeding with caution because the Italian army is using tanks and armored vehicles to cover the soldiers' retreat. It is also reported that the Italian army is retreating in an orderly manner and has now withdrawn across the Devol River, retreating further towards Pogradec. According to various sources, while the Italian rearguard was still crossing the bridge over the Devol River, British bombers bombed the bridge. However, the Italian army had laid explosives on the bridge, preparing to destroy it immediately after the troops had crossed. When the British bombed the bridge with explosives, numerous explosions occurred, completely destroying the bridge. After the bridge was destroyed, the famous Greek Evzone unit, along with Greek cavalry, bravely advanced across the frozen river on horseback. At the time the bridge was blown up, there were several Italian tanks on the bridge, which were all destroyed. The Greek army also discovered a large amount of bridge repair materials in the captured Italian cargo trucks. This material can now be used by the Greek army to repair the Devol River bridge and continue to pursue the Italian army. Greek armored vehicles had crossed the river within a few hours, and Greek soldiers were using Italian anti-aircraft guns to protect the bridge from Italian counter-attacks. It is reported that of the five Italian divisions that previously held the Korçë area, two divisions have been routed by the Greek army in battles to resist the Greek army, hold passes, and defend mountain villages, and were scattered by Greek riflemen. It is reported that the Italian troops in the mountain passes included the famous Bersaglieri and Alpini units. According to the Greek army, the Albanian villages in the highlands have been burned by the Italian army, presumably in retaliation for the Albanian rebellion. (24th United Press)

Greek King Issues Order Commending Troops for Valiant Combat

British Military Supplies Continuously Shipped into Greece by Land, Sea, and Air

Cairo: A Reuters correspondent reports that Britain is continuously shipping military supplies into Greece by land, sea, and air. The reporter saw giant aircraft flying to Greece in the Mediterranean area yesterday, loaded with direct-fire guns, bombs, and ammunition. These planes landed to refuel and took off again after a few minutes. After reaching Greece, they quickly unloaded their cargo and transferred it to the front lines for use by the Greek army. The reporter also saw a heavily guarded air convoy heading for Greece, so that no planes in the convoy were lost en route. The first items to enter Korçë were British cannons, and British planes, mixed with Greek planes, flew over the city as the Greek army entered the city and pursued the fleeing Italian troops. The Greek army is now quickly learning the techniques of using new British cannons and is quite capable of handling them with ease. (24th Reuters)

Bulgaria Denies Troop Concentration on Border

Sofia: The foreign reports that Bulgaria will send a note to the Greek government, presenting Bulgarian demands, were denied by officials here yesterday, proving them to be inaccurate. (24th Huitong Telegram)

Sofia: The Bulgarian official news agency issued the following statement yesterday: "The reports from a certain country's news agency that Bulgarian troops are concentrating on the Turkish-Greek border are denied by the authorities today. The reports are completely unfounded." (24th Huitong Telegram)

### Soviet Government Replaces Ambassador to Germany; New Ambassador Dekanozov Accompanied Molotov on Visit to Berlin

Moscow: The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR has appointed Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Dekanozov as Ambassador to Germany. The previous Ambassador to Germany, Shkvartsev, has been dismissed. It is noted that Dekanozov previously accompanied Molotov to Germany. (24th TASS)

Moscow: A few hours after Romania officially joined the Axis powers of Italy, Germany, and Japan, the Soviet Union announced last night that it was recalling its current ambassador to Germany, Shkvartsev, and replacing him with Deputy Foreign Commissar Dekanozov. The official reason for this unexpected replacement has not been stated, but foreign diplomatic circles in Moscow believe that this move, occurring on the same day that Romania followed Hungary in joining the totalitarian bloc, is noteworthy because Romania and Hungary's accession to the Axis has extended the Axis' power directly to the Black Sea, which is an important rear gateway for the Soviet Union. Turkey and Bulgaria seem to have felt a sense of threat, and the European war situation may become chaotic. The aforementioned diplomatic circles are eager to know whether the replacement of the Soviet ambassador is intended to prevent this trend. It is pointed out that the Soviet Union has repeatedly solemnly declared that the Soviet Union's policy is to limit the scope of the war and keep it as far away from the Soviet border as possible, and before the ambassador was replaced, the German claim that Hungary's accession to the Axis was fully approved and cooperated by the Soviet Union was denied by the Soviet official news agency TASS. (24th International News Service)

### Admiral Leahy Appointed U.S. Ambassador to France

Washington: The appointment of Admiral Leahy as the U.S. Ambassador to the Vichy government has been announced by the authorities. It was previously believed here that President Roosevelt's appointment of an ambassador to France indicated that he was more concerned about the head of the Vichy government, Marshal Pétain, than the Vichy government itself. It was generally known that President Roosevelt's selection of personnel for this position would not be limited to experienced diplomats, which is now even more certain. "The Washington Post" commented on this matter, saying that President Roosevelt is evidently trying to strengthen Marshal Pétain's hand in order to resist Nazi efforts to drag France into the "New European Order." Washington insiders generally view Admiral Leahy as a person who has the President's complete trust. It is generally felt that the situation in the Mediterranean is now extremely urgent, and the final destination of the French fleet is still undecided. Therefore, it is particularly appropriate to appoint a senior naval officer as ambassador to France. (24th Reuters)

### U.S. and Britain Reach Agreement to Lease Western Hemisphere Territories; United States Permitted to Construct Military Bases; Another Step in Solid Cooperation Between the Two Countries

Washington: The Navy Department announced yesterday that the United States and Great Britain have mutually agreed on the locations of British territories in the Western Hemisphere that will be leased to the United States for military bases. The Navy Department also stated that the agreement includes Bermuda, the Bahamas, Jamaica, Antigua, St. Lucia, British Guiana, and Newfoundland, but does not mention Trinidad. It is reported that in Bermuda, the United States will establish an army airfield on Long Bird Island and a naval airfield, naval base, and garrison area on St. David's Island and nearby islands. In addition, the United States will establish an explosives storage depot between St. David's Island and Haddington Island. Britain will also allow the United States to freely build bridges and construct all the necessary conditions for bases in these locations. In the Bahamas, the United States will use the vicinity of Abaco Bay and Mayaguana Island. The United States' interests in Jamaica will include the following seven points: (1) Permission for U.S. ships to dock at Portland Bight; (2) Land area including Goat Island and nearby bays, with an area of 33 square miles; (3) Establishment of defensive fortifications at Portland Bight and Portland Island; (4) Designation of 100 acres of open space near Williamsfield for rest and hospital use; (5) Designation of one square mile of land five miles south of the Vega Canal in May Pen as an emergency auxiliary landing area; (6) The right to develop resources and use the British Royal Naval Dockyard; (7) The joint use of airfields in the area by both the United States and Britain.

### British Air Force Crosses Channel, Heavily Damages German Air Bases; Multiple Dogfights Occur Over the Channel; German and Italian Aircraft Attempts to Attack London Fail

London: The British Air Ministry announced today that last night and early this morning, the British Air Force dealt another major blow to Axis military targets, including German invasion bases in the coastal areas of Europe, which contrasted sharply with the minor air raids by the German Air Force last night. Since yesterday morning, after multiple dogfights between British and German aircraft over the Channel, several squadrons of German bombers attacked Liverpool and cities on the northeast coast yesterday evening, but were repelled by intense German anti-aircraft fire. It is claimed that British fighter squadrons attacked White Cliffs three times, but were all dispersed and driven away by the British Air Force. After dusk, Hitler's air force only launched sporadic air raids. It is believed that the recent arrival of Italian pilots has made it difficult for them to coordinate with the German Air Force, which has greatly hindered German air operations. (24th International Telegram)

London: Enemy aircraft repeatedly attempted to infiltrate London yesterday, but only one squadron of enemy aircraft flew very high over London in three air raids. An Air Ministry communique stated that houses in southern London and a town at the mouth of the Thames were slightly damaged, but the number of casualties was very small. The Messerschmitt Me 109 had not been seen for almost a week, but it flew over again yesterday, but was hindered by land-based artillery fire. Anti-aircraft guns defeated the second wave of attacking enemy aircraft and shot down at least one enemy aircraft in the third wave of attacks, which appeared to be a Junkers bomber. The British Air Force finally drove back the enemy aircraft. Two Dornier seaplanes were shot down by British aircraft off the French coast. (24th Reuters)

London: The British Air Force's targets for its intense attacks on Friday night and Saturday morning were the Merignac airfield near Bordeaux, because it is the concentration point for German aircraft attacking British shipping in the Atlantic. According to the Air Ministry communique, the airfield's buildings and ground aircraft sustained heavy damage. Flames rose hundreds of feet after the airfield was attacked. British pilots could see their bombs falling. Barracks and aircraft hangars along the coast between Brest and Lorient were also bombed that night, as British aircraft continued to attack the bases used by the Germans for their attacks. Another part of the British Air Force attacked targets in the Ruhr region. The night raid covered a wide area. All British planes returned except for one. During daylight yesterday, Central Aircraft attacked enemy airfields at Schiphol and Bergen in the Netherlands, as well as factories in the Ruhr region of Germany. (24th Reuters)

Berlin: A large number of British aircraft attempted to attack Berlin last night, but failed to break through the German air defenses. British aircraft flew towards Berlin from all directions and at different altitudes, and at one point launched a group attack to try to break through the air defenses, but were stopped by searchlights and anti-aircraft guns. Many people in the villages around Berlin did not enter the shelters and watched the battle on the streets. It is claimed that people were seen jumping with parachutes. No bombs fell near Berlin. The British aircraft's bombing of Potsdam and Rauen was also unsuccessful. (24th Huitong Telegram)

Berlin: Two hundred and fifty German aircraft attacked Southampton, a major port on the southern coast of England, last night, dropping 300 tons of explosive bombs and 12,000 incendiary bombs on the harbor, docks, and warehouses, bombing throughout the night and setting fires everywhere. While German aircraft were concentrated on bombing Southampton, a small number of aircraft also dropped bombs on London, Liverpool, and Bristol. The Glandson Ordnance Factory was bombed and caught fire. (24th Huitong Telegram)

London: British communique states that on Saturday night and Sunday morning, British bombers were very active as the weather improved. In addition to bombing the freight yards and stations in Berlin and Leipzig, they also heavily attacked the largest port in the German interior, the port of Duisburg-Ruhrort, the canal docks in Boloyes, and the railroad junction in Dortges. In addition, the Krupp factory in Essen and several airfields were also heavily bombed by British aircraft. A squadron of British bombers also attacked targets in Turin, Italy. Three British planes were lost. (24th Reuters)

London: Last night and early this morning, British bombers heavily attacked northern Italy, Germany, and German-occupied areas. Berlin was heavily bombed again, and several targets were destroyed. However, German officials said that all British aircraft were forced back by heavy anti-aircraft fire and were unable to reach the center of Berlin. The Italian cities attacked included Turin and Reggio Calabria. Italian officials said that British aircraft dropped bombs, Molotov bread baskets, and flares. (24th Reuters)

### Italian Port of Taranto Attacked Again

Cairo: Last night, a communique here disclosed that the important Italian seaport of Taranto was attacked again by the British Air Force. It is said that a large fire started south of the western pier of the port, and there was also a violent explosion near the main railway station, illuminating the entire town. A fire and explosion also occurred near the oil refinery. All British aircraft returned safely to their bases. (24th Reuters)

### Marseille Bombed

Vichy: An aircraft fleet of unknown nationality bombed Marseille at midnight, dropping multiple bombs. Officials here believe that the aircraft were British. Four people were killed and three were injured at the time of the bombing, and several fires broke out. Details are still unknown. French anti-aircraft batteries also opened fire. (24th Huitong News Agency)

Vichy: French State Councillor Laval arrived here this afternoon from Paris to investigate the bombing of Marseille last night. A total of twenty bombs were dropped last night, two of which did not explode, making it possible to trace their origin. It is generally suspected that the bombs were dropped by British aircraft. Political figures here believe that although the leaflets found after the bombing of Marseille are in Italian, they are largely the same as the leaflets dropped by British aircraft in Italy. The French authorities consider this matter quite serious. (24th Huitong Telegram)

### Pope to Make Peace Appeal

Vatican City: Pope Pius XII completed his final important peace appeal last night, so that he could hold mass at St. Peter's Basilica today to pray for the soldiers who have died in the European war. His appeal will be released at this time. According to Church communications sources, the Pope will praise the United States' efforts for peace in his speech. This speech was originally intended to be religious in nature and avoid political involvement. (24th United Press)

### England Urgently Hopes for US Financial Aid: British Ambassador States After Returning to His Post

Washington – British Ambassador Lord Lothian recently returned to England to confer with various leaders of his home government. He arrived back here today, and when reporters asked him about the Johnson Act, which the United States is considering amending or canceling, the British Ambassador replied that such a suggestion would not be appropriate for the British side to make. As for how Britain will continue to pay for the military supplies provided by the United States, it will be resolved within the next six months. It was also suggested that Britain liquidate its gold and bonds to cover expenses in the US exceeding $100,000. (Reuter's dispatch, 24th)

New York – British Ambassador to the United States, Lothian, returned here from England today and told reporters that Britain is increasingly feeling the inadequacy of its financial resources. All cash and foreign securities will soon be exhausted, and the financial difficulties in the budget for the coming year will be very serious. Therefore, next year will be a difficult year for the country, not only requiring various war supplies such as munitions and ships, but perhaps also financial aid. American assistance would be appreciated. Britain does not have any feelings that American aid is insufficient. The British people hold a very high belief in final victory without any doubt. The bombing of London has only strengthened national unity. The British feel that they will certainly not be defeated by Hitler, but will defeat Hitler. Lothian will immediately depart for Washington, and after returning there, he will expedite matters regarding increased US assistance to Britain. (Reuter's dispatch, 24th)

New York – The American Institute of Public Opinion announced yesterday that 45% of the American people favor the United States changing the Johnson Act's loan restrictions to England. The question used in the survey was: "The Johnson Act stipulates that the United States will no longer loan money to any country that does not pay interest on previous debts from the European war. Do you support changing this law to allow Britain to borrow money from the United States?" (United Press dispatch, 24th)

### A Painful History of the European War (3): Three Protagonists in the French Tragedy

(3) Reynaud, Exhausted by Coping

After Reynaud returned to Paris from London, Parliament was about to reconvene. Besides announcing the intensification of the blockade, there was not enough time to take any other measures. In reality, the news of intensifying the blockade did not make much of an impression, and even he himself did not have much confidence in it. Last winter, when Reynaud was still Minister of Finance, he stood between the Minister of Blockade and the Minister of Armaments, laughing and saying that he hoped the war would achieve its victorious goal sooner, relying less on the first friend (referring to the blockade) and more on the second friend (referring to armaments). Well-informed French people generally did not trust the blockade very much, and the parliamentarians, during their recess, also heard unfavorable reactions to the government's declarations from their constituents. Therefore, they sent representatives to Daladier, asking him when he would "carry out the execution of the Reynaud government." They thought the sooner the better. However, Daladier already had a clear plan and knew that Reynaud was about to fall, so he did not want to push him down himself. In short, in this critical moment of survival, the farcical drama in the French Parliament was still being performed with great enthusiasm.

In the days just before the direct clash, Reynaud secretly told his subordinates that he would feel very lucky if the number of abstentions in the Chamber of Deputies did not exceed sixty votes. At the same time, the leader of the Socialist Party, Léon Blum, had it spread that Reynaud was not a proponent of a major offensive, contrary to the rumors spread by the opposition party. It was also learned from other sources that Reynaud, after meeting with the military leaders, knew that they had no such plans for the time being. In the first few days after the war began, people generally believed that a long-term war could make Germany yield, and this idea was prevalent in London as well. Former British Secretary of State for War, Hore-Belisha, declared, "Can we win safely?"

Daladier knew that there were gaps in French defenses and that the statistics submitted to the parliamentary committees contained many errors. From September of last year to March of this year, he sometimes felt deeply pessimistic; however, he allowed France to believe that "we can defeat the enemy without much effort," and therefore, he became increasingly popular. When Daladier resigned, one parliamentarian even shouted in panic that the war led by Reynaud was no longer a "war of a democratic country."

Since France had no grand plans, it only returned to the path of intensifying the blockade, and on April 7, laid mines off the coast of Norway to prevent iron ore from being transported to Germany. Germany responded by invading Denmark and Norway on April 9. At this point, the motion to overthrow the French government was no longer an issue; Germany's initiative had saved Reynaud's cabinet's life. However, the "waiting" government or the commanders of the three armed forces were able to plan and devise strategies to prevent national disasters. Their time, however, was lost from that point onward.

No matter how the French government responded to an enemy taking the initiative, it was always one step behind and ineffective. The meeting held at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 7:00 AM on April 9 was a foreshadowing. Two days later, Weygand set off for Syria, and the Prime Minister gave flowers to this commander who had not been given the supreme command of the country to see him off. At that time, the partnership between Daladier and Gamelin remained unshaken.

From April 9 onward, the situation took a sharp turn for the worse. France's fate no longer depended on long-term mistakes; it would now be a total reckoning that would affect the entire country. Weygand was appointed Commander-in-Chief with difficulty on May 19, but the situation was already beyond saving, and even with extraordinary abilities, he could not turn the tide.

The Commander-in-Chief and Minister of War, who had been responsible for France's military affairs for four years, only took responsibility when the crisis was imminent, while Prime Minister Reynaud, who had only been in office for a few weeks, had to bear not only his own sins but also the blame for several former Prime Ministers.

In two weeks, things changed so quickly and unexpectedly that Reynaud was often confused and indecisive. How to deal with the French fleet was a clear example. He was probably so confused at this time that he could not adapt to the changes. His response to events could not emulate Napoleon or Clemenceau's personal appearances and improvisations, but instead, he hid in his residence, drafting speeches, preparing to broadcast them on the radio. Even if every word was moving, it would not help the overall situation. Moreover, fate destined him to announce news of defeat every time he stood before the microphone, making the French people regard him as a "bad omen" and afraid to listen to his broadcast speeches. In short, Reynaud's indecisiveness was already very obvious, as can be seen from simultaneously giving General Petain and Baudouin two important positions, which showed his confusion.

French law stipulates very clearly that it is the government's responsibility to preside over the war situation, and the commander is only responsible for executing military affairs. Therefore, the French army must be commanded by civilian officials in peacetime and cannot determine the country's military policy. The democratic country initially established this principle, originally imitating the precedents of enlightened monarchs of past dynasties. How could anyone have known that the relationship between the military and the government would change with the times and become completely different from the original intention of the legislation? The government granted the generals the power to act expediently, thinking that it could protect the country's peace, but did not know that it was abandoning its responsibilities and deceiving itself.

In the French Third Republic, the relationship between the military and politicians had never been very smooth. Before 1914, countless factional disputes in Parliament arose from anti-militarism. Army commanders were often the targets of attacks and investigations, and they had to be constantly vigilant, which made those in charge very wary.

After 1914, the French victorious soldiers naturally enjoyed great prestige, and the saying "the General Staff is never wrong" spread everywhere. The military and political circles had long been incompatible, and at this time, the military's power rose, and they gradually became dictatorial. The admired victors dominated the entire country. The old guard remained entrenched, and the newcomers had no way to rise. Those who advocated new weapons and new tactics were all subservient to others. If a major or lieutenant colonel talked about the power of tanks in the War of Flandres, a group of generals would just smile and dismiss it as nothing more than reading an ideal novel.

How could anyone know that the military situation was vastly different from the past and that one could not stubbornly refuse to change? France's first mistake was not knowing that "the occupation of territory" could not be like Napoleon's use of troops, sparing no expense to fight on enemy territory. This is what is called "defending against the enemy outside the borders is better than defending against the enemy inside the borders." Because France took a purely defensive position, it gradually developed a mystical concept of believing in the Maginot Line, reducing the spirit of seizing the initiative.

In fact, military offensive and defensive strategies must adapt to changing circumstances. How can one cling to old ways? In 1914 to 1915, the French army lacked heavy artillery. If it had taken the offensive at that time, it would have made a big mistake. Of course, it had to hold firm. Later, those who advocated a defensive position often used the excuse that France lacked manpower and could not take a large-scale offensive war. But in the modern era of war, which relies on material resources rather than manpower, is this statement credible? If France had ten or fifteen mechanized reserve divisions, even if Germany's population was twice that of France, who could say that the French army was unable to stop the German offensive?

### Lack of Libido in Men Is Not Always a Pathological Condition

– Co-authored by Yao Chongpei, MD, USA, and Zhan Nianceng, Venereal Disease Specialist

(Time) 10 AM to 6 PM, closed on Sundays

One often hears people say: lack of libido in men is a pathological condition. Even more people say: a decrease in libido in men can indicate that his life is coming to an end! The purpose of this sensational fallacy is nothing more than to encourage people to indulge in licentiousness, and the harm it causes is greater than knives and guns killing people.

Our argument: lack of libido in men is not always a pathological condition. Because for accomplished men after marriage, the desire for career often outweighs love. Or, because their mental cultivation deepens gradually, or because their spouses are dissatisfied with their intentions, they gradually develop a sense of indifference towards sexual desire. But this does not mean that they are weak and incompetent. Because when there is a beautiful view and a good night, when they are in high spirits; or when the couple is happy and acts playfully, they will definitely show their vitality and grandeur, both to delight their own minds and to comfort the tender and ardent affection hidden deep in the heart of their beautiful spouse. Therefore, this kind of man not only does not hinder love, but also helps love to be eternally long-lived!

However, there is a type of man who suffers from early masturbation, nocturnal emission, early marriage, and excessive indulgence, causing significant damage to the secretions of the gonads (i.e., semen). They suffer from premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, scattered energy, thin semen leading to infertility, kidney deficiency, brain weakness, and neurasthenia, etc. This type of man often has two different manifestations: one is that they cannot find pleasure in sexual life, feel tired of life, and fall into a bitter state of pessimism, so their libido is weak. This is undoubtedly a pathological condition. The other is that their bodies are deficient, but their desires are strong. During the long winter nights, they frequently want to try, arousing their wives' excitement. However, in real sexual life, they only flash briefly or cannot perform at all. How can this not arouse their wives' hatred? It is often heard that couples become estranged, love is broken, and various family tragedies such as elopement and divorce occur. It is also countless that the symptoms worsen, leading to premature aging, short life, and early death!

If there are the above-mentioned symptoms, then it cannot be confused with lack of libido. One must seek thorough treatment as soon as possible to avoid serious consequences! The method of treatment: According to world-renowned doctors and our experience, taking gonadotropin preparations made from healthy animals is the most effective treatment for this. Therefore, this agent was invented earliest, supervised most carefully, contains precious ingredients, contains cruciform crystals of gonadal hormone, pituitary crystals, as well as deer antler essence, vitamins, and many other ingredients. Therefore, its efficacy is certain, and its replenishing power is great, unmatched by any similar preparations. After taking it, semen can be produced, kidneys can be nourished, the brain can be strengthened, and blood circulation can be promoted in one day and night. Continuous use will further promote development, nourish nerves, and regulate metabolism. The above-mentioned symptoms will inevitably be cured invisibly in a short period, and energy can be further increased. Elderly people often take it to prolong life, rejuvenate and return to youth. However, those suffering from nocturnal emission must also take the highly effective medicine for treating nocturnal emission "Ximitu's Semen-Consolidating Tablets" (available in Wuzhou Taihe Sino-Western Huaying Sino-English and other large pharmacies) to consolidate the sperm gate and stop the leakage, then the source will be opened and the outflow will be restricted, and the effect will be even faster.

Patient Li Jianfei, from Hunan Province, age 30, married for 10 years, suffered from nocturnal emission, brain weakness, kidney deficiency, lack of children, neurasthenia, etc. Although he had repeatedly taken over-the-counter medicines on the market, they had little effect. Recently, the symptoms worsened, and a friend urged him to go to Hong Kong for work, but he was blocked by illness and was extremely anxious! (Above is self-reported) Last month, he came to our clinic for diagnosis and treatment. After a detailed examination of his symptoms, we found that they matched what he said, and we instructed him to purchase two dozen "Gonadotrophin" and one dozen "Ximitu's Semen-Consolidating Tablets" and take them concurrently, and to apply electrotherapy every other day. It has only been a month, and now all his diseases have suddenly disappeared, his face is rosy, his energy is abundant, and the love of his couple is even stronger. We have heard that he will take his family to Hong Kong to take up a new position, then in the warm and beautiful southern country, another sweet couple will be added!

### Remedies for Imperfect Breasts

– Yao Chongpei, MD, USA

Forehead carved with tram tracks, breasts like deflated purses.

Such women may dress up, but men will shake their heads. Don't underestimate a woman's pair of breasts! It really has ten thousand points of magic and precious value. To be honest, if a woman's breasts are higher and more elastic, it can not only fully set off her plump chest and graceful waist, forming a beautiful curve that makes people intoxicated with love. At the same time, due to the soundness of her own ovarian function and the vigor of her metabolism, her temperament is gentle and supple, her skin is crystal clear and white, and her cheeks are red and charming. Such a girl, not only in her virgin era - it can also be said in her study era, due to her extraordinary intelligence and character, can be among the best, be the most outstanding student, and be loved by teachers, elders, relatives, and friends. Even if she marries later, relying on these beautiful conditions, wouldn't her husband obey her every command and treat her like a living treasure?

But the facts tell us that such women are also the most difficult to find. The only main reason is that women have various physiological differences, such as menstruation and pregnancy. Therefore, there are often women in their prime who have many tram tracks engraved on their foreheads, rough skin, and are skinny, and especially embarrassing is a pair of breasts, like two dry, deflated purses. Although such women are fully covered with powder, parading in the streets, there are few who are not sneered at by men? If you want to remedy it, the most practical and reliable way is to quickly take the gonadotropin ovarian preparation "Gonadotrophin" for women. The main reason why the breasts are sagging and lose their fitness is that the gonadal ovarian function is destroyed by symptoms such as irregular menstruation, white discharge, weak multiparity, and malnutrition. After taking "Gonadotrophin" for women, the ovarian function can be cultivated, metabolism can be strengthened, menstruation can be regulated, and the palace can be warmed and the discharge can be stopped in one day and night. If you continue to take it, it can not only cure various symptoms, but also make the breasts high, the hips plump, and the complexion rosy, staying young forever.

### Young Men with Nocturnal Emission Enjoy a Difficult Life of Happiness

– Venereal Disease Specialist Zhan Nianceng

Everyone knows that nocturnal emission is a symbol of weakness. If young people suffering from nocturnal emission continue to delay treatment, the degree of weakness will inevitably increase rapidly. The most terrible thing is the brain weakness and kidney deficiency caused by nocturnal emission!

The semen in a man's body is like the lubricating oil in a machine, which can lubricate the functions of various parts and make them active. The desire for sexual love is due to the activity of semen (i.e., gonadal secretions). Therefore, they enthusiastically choose a spouse, talk about love, get married, have children, and form a family... opening up the brilliant flowers of life and enjoying the infinite happiness of life! If a man suffers from kidney deficiency due to untreated nocturnal emission, then premature ejaculation and impotence will inevitably follow; or nocturnal emission will weaken the development function. Although he is an adult, his sexual organs are still thin, like a child; or the semen is thin, leading to infertility after a long marriage. All these symptoms make it difficult to enjoy the joy of newlyweds, let alone the happiness of life. Countless young people in the world have lost love and joy because of this and have fallen into the tragic situation of the world? Those who suffer from brain weakness and insomnia due to nocturnal emission, which affects their studies and careers, and regret it in their old age, or even die young, are also everywhere!

The most effective treatment for nocturnal emission is to take "Ximitu's Semen-Consolidating Tablets." This medicine can indeed consolidate the sperm gate and calm the nerves. After taking it, it can achieve the effect of sleeping and stopping nocturnal emission on the same night. However, patients must recognize the words "Ximitu..." when purchasing it to avoid being confused by miscellaneous medicines and delaying the treatment. Those who have already had the above-mentioned symptoms due to nocturnal emission must also take the gonadotropin preparation "Gonadotrophin" made from healthy animals to cultivate and replenish the brain, kidneys, semen, blood, and nerves. Taking it continuously for a month can increase body weight, strengthen energy, and eliminate all diseases invisibly. In addition to taking the above-mentioned good medicines, if patients can come to our clinic to receive new therapies such as electrotherapy injections, we can guarantee a cure.

### Fundamentally Resolve the Food Problem of This City: National Rice Must Be Freely Transported to Shanghai

### Previous Consultations a Month Ago Have Not Yielded Results
### Relying on Foreign Rice to Make a Living Is Still Not the Best Policy
### Coal Stocks Are Sufficient to Meet Demand This Winter; No Need to Panic

According to well-informed sources yesterday, the Shanghai Municipal Council consulted with the Japanese authorities in this city more than a month ago to allow domestic rice and wheat to be freely transported to Shanghai from the occupied areas, but no substantial results were achieved. Therefore, there seems to be no end in sight for citizens having to pay high prices to buy foreign rice. The only way to fundamentally solve Shanghai's rice problem is for domestic rice to be transported here steadily without obstruction. Currently, the amount of domestic rice being transported into Shanghai is negligible, only accounting for one-tenth of what Chinese residents need.

Rice Merchants Speculate and Raise Prices Artificially

A few weeks ago, there were rumors that the reserves of foreign rice in this city were running low. Fortunately, a large amount was shipped from Vietnam, which prevented a crisis from occurring. Currently, the selling price of foreign rice has not yet fallen due to exchange rate differences, transportation costs, and insurance costs. According to well-informed sources, a few days ago, there were rumors that war had broken out between Vietnam and Thailand, causing turmoil in the Shanghai rice market. It was also rumored that the Vietnamese authorities might soon ban rice from being shipped out of Saigon. Rice merchants seized the opportunity to profit, causing rice prices to rise.

Foreign Rice Supply Is Extremely Abundant

Subsequently, both Siam and Vietnam have been shipping large quantities of rice to Shanghai, and the rumors have subsided. More than 7,500 tons of Australian wheat have also arrived in Shanghai and are being unloaded. Shipping circles say that Siam, Saigon, and Hong Kong will soon continue to ship large quantities of rice and wheat. Last week, the Jinan [steamer] carried 7,153 bags of rice, and the Yuezhou [steamer] carried 4,435 bags of rice, both arriving in Shanghai. A French ship also carried 14,200 bags of rice and wheat. And the Lina [steamer], which arrived in Shanghai on Wednesday, also unloaded 7,500 tons of Australian wheat. The current reserves are sufficient, and there is no possibility of interruption.

Coal Stocks Are Sufficient; No Need to Panic

However, most citizens are concerned about the future of their food supply due to the current situation and the lack of clarity in the market conditions. According to an official from the Shanghai Municipal Council's Price Survey Department, the city has sufficient stocks of Hongji coal, so there is no need to panic about the future supply of coal. It is unreasonable for coal balls to increase in price. The price of coal should not change much in the next few months, and the prices of imported food are only slightly affected by the European war.

### Salvation Army: Relief for the Hidden Poor

### Small Loans Can Be Obtained with Shop Guarantees
### Shelter Can Be Established Next Month

The beggar shelter, which is being actively prepared, is expected to be established next month. Thousands of beggars in this city will be able to find a place to call home. However, there is no concrete relief plan for the hidden poor who are difficult to openly beg. It is reported that the Salvation Army has specifically established a small loan relief program to address this issue. Any legitimate merchants who have fallen on hard times and have shop guarantees can apply to the Army for relief. After investigation by the Army, loans can be granted. This loan does not charge any interest. Borrowers use this money for small-scale operations. If it is used for improper purposes, the guarantor will be held accountable. There have already been more than 700 people applying for this relief loan.

### American Red Cross Sends 20,000 Bags of Rice and Wheat to Shanghai to Relieve the Poor, Distributed by the American Red Cross in Shanghai, Also Collecting a Large Quantity of Medicines to be Shipped to Shanghai Soon

Refugees in Shanghai After the War Gather: They are facing difficulties with food and clothing, have no means of livelihood, and are displaced and impoverished, which is truly pitiful. In view of this, the American Red Cross, taking advantage of the return to the United States last November of its Director-General and Director-General of the China Relief Commission, Mr. Baker, extensively promoted and appealed to the American people to generously provide relief. It is now known that Mr. Baker has returned from his leave and arrived in Chongqing via Mandalay Road in late last month, fully presiding over China's relief work to benefit the poor. His spirit is commendable.

Large Shipment of Rice and Wheat Arrives in Shanghai Last Night

The American Red Cross Board, at the urging of Mr. Baker, decided to be responsible for soliciting various relief supplies in the United States and transporting them to China. At 6:00 PM yesterday, the American ship "Collinsworth" arrived in Shanghai from the United States, carrying 20,000 bags of rice and wheat, which were handed over to the American Red Cross in Shanghai for distribution to various refugee organizations. Mr. De, the Director-General of the YMCA, also participated in the matter. The livelihood of 15,000 refugees in this city will be guaranteed as a result, and a serious problem will not occur for the time being.

Spare No Effort in Relieving Refugees

According to reports, the American Red Cross was originally an advisory body for the American side at the beginning of the Sino-Japanese War, and was once closed. Later, it was reorganized into the American Red Cross in Shanghai, a branch of the American headquarters. Since its establishment, it has spared no effort in relieving Chinese refugees. From October 1937 to March of this year, the American Red Cross remitted 800,000 yuan to Shanghai for relief donations. In December 1937, the refugee problem in Shanghai was extremely serious. At that time, there were 18 shelters, accommodating 137,000 refugees, and 75,000 people were wandering the streets without a place to live. In addition, about 665,000 people fled from the occupied areas to Shanghai and lived in the homes of relatives and friends, but their lives were difficult. Fortunately, they were able to maintain their lives thanks to the continuous assistance of the American Red Cross. In August of this year, the American Red Cross remitted another US$10,000 to Chongqing to relieve civilians who were victims of air raids.

Additional Medicines to be Shipped Soon

In addition to the aforementioned rice, wheat, and donations, the American Red Cross is also collecting a large quantity of medicines in the United States to be shipped to China, including 15 million tablets of quinine, 20 million tablets of aspirin, 1 million tablets of sulfanilamide, 20,000 pounds of heavy magnesium carbonate, 30,000 pounds of boric acid, 2,000 pounds of anesthetics, 5 million yards of gauze, and 40,000 pounds of cotton. The medicines can be used by 2,500 patients for six months, and are scheduled to arrive in Rangoon in the near future, and then be transferred to Chongqing via Mandalay Road, and then distributed to various places. Currently, the American Red Cross in this city is also trying to ship 900,000 tablets of quinine from Java to Shanghai for use.

### Deadline for Winter Clothing Donation Approaching at the End of the Month, All Sectors Urged to Donate as Soon as Possible, Little Time Remaining, Do Not Miss the Opportunity to Serve the Country, Schools and Organizations Should Especially Take Responsibility

The winter clothing donation campaign in this city has been actively promoted to all sectors by the Donation and慰勞 (comforting) Committee after it pledged 500,000 yuan to the Chongqing General Association. The goal is to raise 1 million yuan in Shanghai. Since the campaign began, all citizens have deeply understood the great righteousness and enthusiastically donated. As of the end of last month, the committee has verified the donation reports from various organizations and the used receipt stubs.

It is confirmed that various trade associations have remitted approximately 400,000 yuan, schools have remitted more than 70,000 yuan, and organizations and institutions have remitted more than 50,000 yuan, totaling more than 900,000 yuan in national currency. In view of the frequent good news from the front lines, various sectors are very excited and have redoubled their efforts in the donation work. In order to fulfill the original intention and raise the full amount, in addition to reporting to the Chongqing General Association, the deadline has been extended by one month, so that all sectors can contribute as much as possible during the extension period and continue to shoulder this work to complete the glorious task. As the extension deadline is approaching, the committee is making a final appeal for donations to all sectors, and hopes that trade associations, schools, organizations, etc. that have not participated in the winter donation campaign will rise up and promote donations in the short term, and do not miss the opportunity for citizens to serve the country. It is also hoped that those in charge of various organizations will take responsibility and participate immediately, and there should be no excuses or cowardly evasions. Furthermore, those trade associations and organizations that have the strength but have not made efforts to effectively promote donations have submitted only a very small amount of donations to perfunctorily fulfill their responsibilities. During this final period, it is hoped that they will continue to make total efforts to effectively promote donations to reach the amount stipulated by the committee. The committee will close the campaign at the end of this month and will handle the complete closure. It is hoped that all those who have not participated and all organizations that have raised a certain amount should donate as much as possible as soon as possible, submit the donations on time, and complete the great mission of the era.

### British War Fund Continues to Receive Large Sums Last Week

The British Central War Fund received 75,000 yuan in donations last week. The total amount has reached 1,404,198.74 yuan. Among the donations last week, 14,000 yuan was from the sale of flowers on European War Peace Memorial Day. The stock exchange donated 10,000 yuan, the China Textile Company donated 5,000 yuan, and two rubber companies donated a total of 7,000 yuan. Other private donations were all above 1,000 or 2,000 yuan, so the total amount is indeed quite considerable. In addition, the fund received a donation of 40 pounds from the British expatriate community in Nanjing last week, totaling 22,465 pounds, 8 shillings, and 9 pence.

### Frugality and Nation-Building Movement Advances, Reaching 50 Million Yuan, A Strong Manifestation of Self-Reliance, Completing the Great Cause of Nation-Building in Hardship

Since the authorities advocated the frugality and nation-building savings movement, and the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Farmers Bank of China, and Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau issued national construction savings bonds, compatriots at home and abroad have responded enthusiastically and purchased them. It is learned that due to the active promotion over the past year, as of the anniversary of the establishment of the National Savings Association on November 10 of this year, the total amount of savings bonds purchased by compatriots across the country, including overseas Chinese, has reached 50 million yuan. The savings deposits received by various banks and the savings and remittances bureau over the past year have also increased by more than double compared to the previous year. Currently, this movement, due to the widespread establishment of savings promotion networks and agencies for collecting savings funds, has spread to provinces, cities, and counties across the country, and even to remote villages. Overseas Chinese compatriots who purchase savings bonds by mail, since the Joint Treasury revised the flexible measures, the procedures for purchasing by mail have become more secure and convenient. People in the international community have unanimously praised the Chinese authorities for advocating frugality and nation-building, and the enthusiastic response of the people across the country, believing that the strong manifestation of self-reliance of the Chinese nation will surely enable them to complete the great cause of nation-building in the midst of arduous warfare.

### New and Old Provincial Notes in Various Provinces All in General Circulation in Shanghai, Newly Issued Provincial Notes Allowed to be Used in the Same Way as National Currency, Jiangxi Yumin Bank Notes Can be Applied for Exchange

Since the promulgation of the measures for managing the issuance of one-yuan notes and subsidiary notes by provincial banks or local banks in various provinces, provincial banks or local banks have complied with the orders of the Ministry of Finance to issue one-yuan notes and subsidiary notes. As for the banknotes issued in the past, they have all been taken over by the Issuing Reserve Management Committee. The newly issued one-yuan notes and subsidiary notes are limited to circulation within the province. However, provincial banks or local banks mutually exchange them and use them in the same way as the legal tender of the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Farmers Bank of China, and Central Bank. The reserve fund is 60% in cash and 40% in guaranteed reserve.

Mutual Exchange Between Banks

The reporter of New Voice News learned from the banking community yesterday that provincial banks or local banks are: (1) Zhejiang is Zhejiang Local Bank, (2) Jiangsu is Jiangsu Bank and Jiangsu Farmers Bank, (3) Jiangxi is Jiangxi Yumin Bank, (4) Fujian is Fujian Provincial Bank, (5) Anhui is Anhui Local Bank. All of the above banks have issued banknotes and small denomination notes, and have all complied with the order to be taken over by the Issuing Reserve Committee. Therefore, the reserve funds for the banknotes previously issued by various banks have been transferred to the Issuing Reserve Committee. From now on, the newly issued banknotes are limited to one-yuan notes and subsidiary notes of one dime and five dimes, and will be handled in accordance with the newly promulgated measures. Various banks have also agreed to follow the previous method of mutual exchange. Although the banknotes are limited to circulation within the province, all banks agree to mutually exchange them.

General Circulation in Shanghai

Now, provincial banks and local banks have drafted operation plans and proposed banknote amounts and types, and submitted them to the Ministry of Finance for approval to issue new banknotes. The Central Trust Bureau will print them on behalf of the banks. After the printing is completed, they will be sent to the Issuing Reserve Management Committee for safekeeping by the designated custodian bank. The issuers will deposit the reserve fund with the custodian bank and collect the banknotes for issuance. Because the new measures stipulate that they are limited to circulation within the province, various banks are doing their utmost to prevent them from flowing into other provinces. Regarding the one-yuan notes and subsidiary notes of the Jiangsu Farmers Bank and the Zhejiang Local Bank in the Shanghai concession area, they have been in general circulation in the past, so they can still be used in general circulation in the future. Those who hold Jiangxi Yumin Bank notes, etc., can apply to the Shanghai branches or offices of the respective banks for exchange into legal tender.

### Shanghai Municipal Council to Reconsider Telephone Rate Increase, Tendency to Reduce it Appropriately

The Shanghai Telephone Company recently requested a rate increase from the Shanghai Municipal Council because it intends to install 16,000 new telephone users, and the cost of purchasing equipment is extremely high. Although the proposed rate increase plan has not yet reached the decision stage, the extent of the rate increase has increased across the board, causing strong opposition from residents throughout the city. According to the Ping Ming News reporter, the Shanghai Municipal Council will hold a board meeting at 4:00 PM on Wednesday to discuss the issue. According to well-informed sources, the Shanghai Municipal Council authorities, in view of the excessive telephone rate increase and public outcry, are reconsidering the proposed rate increase plan and have a tendency to reduce it appropriately. However, it is still necessary to wait for the French Municipal Council to reply before discussing it together. It is not yet known whether the French Municipal Council's reply can be delivered before the board meeting on Wednesday. According to the opinions of the Chinese side, the reason for the telephone company's decision to increase rates is due to the excessive cost of installing 16,000 new telephones. Therefore, this burden should be added to the new telephone users. The Shanghai Municipal Council should also consider this point from the fundamental level, which is the fair way to go. Moreover, telephone is a public utility, and public interests should be taken into account, and the burden on public use should not be increased excessively.

### Draft of Real Estate Leasing Regulations Formulated by the French Concession Housing Rent Research Association

The French Concession Housing Rent Research Committee has drafted a chapter on the leasing and transfer of real estate within the concession, as reported in previous newspapers. According to the Continental News, the French Concession Public Works Bureau has promulgated regulations on the leasing and transfer of houses to prevent the malpractices of collecting small rents and forcing the sale of furniture at high prices. According to major foreign real estate companies in the city, they have never charged small rents, so they are not affected by these regulations. Those who will be hit are many Chinese real estate companies and second landlords. An executive of a French real estate company said that he has heard of the collection of small rents, but it has nothing to do with the company. The reporter recently asked

Public Works Bureau

Deputy Director and Head of the Information Office, Mr. Nash, about the Shanghai Municipal Council following the example of the company and trying to ban the collection of small rents. Nash replied that he could not comment until the Director-General and President of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Mr. Fessenden, returned from his short vacation. Mr. Fessenden is scheduled to return to work on Monday, and may issue a statement on the matter the next day. It is also heard that the

French Municipal Council

will evaluate rents with reference to the current situation and study the expenses of the industry, such as the increase in land taxes, the increase in repair costs, the ratio of Chinese and foreign rents, and the purchasing power of the currency to determine the standard. The original text of the draft chapter is recorded below for reference:

The lessor's adoption of the method of terminating the original lease contract shall take effect immediately upon arrival of the aforementioned notice, without the need to invoke other legal procedures.

### Market Price of Government Bonds Rising Steadily, Creditworthiness Increasingly Solid, Establishment of Sino-American Loan Encouraging, 96 Government Bonds Soar in Opening Price

After the Ministry of Finance made every effort to maintain creditworthiness, the principal and interest of government bonds issued after the war were repaid on schedule and never overdue. The unified reconstruction and growth bonds issued earlier were discounted and paid by the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Farmers Bank of China, and Central Bank, which was deeply trusted by bondholders. In addition, good news was frequently reported from various places, and the Sino-American loan was established. Therefore, the Shanghai securities grey market was encouraged, and prices soared. Various banks and overseas Chinese absorbed the bonds in unison, creating a new record since August 13, which is sufficient to show the strengthening of the government's position and the consolidation of the legal tender's credit, and is also a good phenomenon in the financial dynamics of Shanghai. It can also enable Shanghai's floating capital to gradually enter the right track. At the same time, due to the improvement in the bond market, the number of subscribers for the government bonds issued after the war is increasing day by day. The first issue of the military supplies and construction bonds issued this year has been fully subscribed. The 96 government bonds, which have been suspended for a long time, were opened for auction last Friday, and the price rose by eight cents on Saturday. The consolidation of the credit of national bonds can be seen.

### Embezzlement and Corruption, Three Defendants Sentenced

Lin Jingshui, manager of Liyuan Firm, Room 102, No. 126 Hankou Road, recently had two batches of goods imported and entrusted Maolong Trading Firm at No. 7A The Bund to transport and declare them. When the goods arrived, Lin Jingshui, manager of Julong, notified Pan that the customs had deemed that the prices of the two batches of goods were underestimated and that additional customs duties were required, totaling more than 2,202 yuan. Pan did not suspect anything and paid the full amount. However, after inquiring with the customs, it was found that the matter of additional customs duties mentioned by Lin was completely fictitious and was obviously a deliberate fraud. Therefore, he reported to the General Police Station, which ordered detective Han Shoushan to arrest Lin Jingshui and escort him to the Fourth Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Peng Qixin prosecuted him for fraud under Article 339 of the Criminal Code. After questioning by Judge Dai, Lin confessed to his crime, but the civil lawsuit was settled with Pan. The court then announced the verdict, sentencing Lin Jingshui to six months' imprisonment with a three-year reprieve.

Zhou Bing'ao, Zhou Bing'ao from Ningbo, lives at No. 11 Tongding Lane, Sichuan Road. He was an accountant at the Yingming Photo Studio at No. 311 Nanjing Road. Recently, he took advantage of his position to embezzle public funds of 2,148.5 yuan. Manager Zhou Yanqing investigated and reported to the General Police Station, which ordered detectives to arrest Zhou Bing'ao and escort him to the First Special Court for questioning. The case was previously referred to the First Special Court for custody. The case was previously referred to the First Special Court for custody. On the previous day, Judge Xiao opened the court for further questioning. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi said that the case had been verified, and the civil lawsuit between the original and defendant parties had been mediated.

Zhang Jundai, the Lixin Handkerchief Factory at No. 4 Lane 17, Jiaotong Road, was opened by Cao Caisheng from Pudong, who hired Zhang Jundai as an accountant. From January to the end of October of this year, Zhang took the opportunity to embezzle accounts amounting to 4,791.76 yuan. After Cao discovered this, he reported to the General Police Station, which ordered detectives to arrest Zhang Jundai and escort him to the First Division of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu prosecuted him according to law. After questioning by President Feng, Zhang Jundai was sentenced to six months' imprisonment with a two-year reprieve in court.

### Humorous Elements in "The Great Dictator"

Is this a case of being insufficient before the world? Or did that cannon, by chance, suffer a slight ailment? That X-7418-R shell did go out, but it didn't reach Paris. Not far from its hometown, it lay on the battlefield like a fat pig. Neither exploding nor detonating, it was completely silent.

The Turkish military officer, seeing this scene, was greatly astonished. So he ordered someone to investigate the reason why the shell didn't explode. The Major ordered the Captain, the Captain ordered the Platoon Leader, the Platoon Leader ordered the Corporal. The Corporal, already a minimal figure in the army, like sesame seeds or green beans on the road, was unwilling to risk this danger and passed the order on to the Private, Hynkel. Chaplin, being the lowest of the low, seeing that there was no one "behind" him to pass the order to, had to bite the bullet and check why the shell didn't explode!

Hynkel hesitated to move forward, neither able to advance nor daring to retreat. He inched closer to the shell, one step at a time. But that mischievous shell not only started spitting fire but also began spinning around him. This frightened him immensely, almost causing his soul to leave his body, making him truly "spin in circles." The audience, seeing this, felt a little worried for him, but mostly, they were laughing so hard their stomachs hurt. However, heaven never bars all roads. That big shell, in the blink of an eye, with a "whoosh," disappeared without a trace.

Hynkel, as represented by Chaplin, did many awkward things in the army. At that time, anti-aircraft guns were crudely made, with the barrel pointing straight up. Attached to the gun body was a chair for the person observing enemy planes. Hynkel also once served as an anti-aircraft gunner, hanging in mid-air, observing enemy planes through the periscope, aiming the gun. His expression was beyond any painter's ability to capture.

Hynkel was a soft-hearted and nervous person, unable to withstand living under fire. His ears were so badly affected by the explosions that he developed a kind of mental illness. He forgot everything completely, unable even to speak. Later, he was discharged from the army and returned to his hometown to recover. After regaining his health, Tomainia was ruled by a dictator. With no way to make a living, he became a barber to support himself.

At this time, Chaplin on the screen lived in the Jewish quarter, returning to his civilian identity. His three treasures—a bowler hat, a bamboo cane, and large, wide-toed, broken leather shoes—were all back on his person. Of course, he also had his signature clothes to wear: a short, narrow jacket, two balloon-like trousers, a stiff collar, a black tie, a small vest... wrapping Chaplin's entire body. He couldn't sit still, couldn't stand steady, raised his cane, raised his hat, constantly busy. When he walked, the heels of his large leather shoes landed first, dragging along, his feet pointing outward, swaying back and forth, as if he had no bones, only a copper wire holding him up from the inside...

This trademark and style of his has been the same since 1914, until today. Anyone who has seen "Shoulder Arms," "The Pilgrim," "The Gold Rush," and "City Lights," can close their eyes, and this "precious living figure" will immediately appear before them. There's no need to describe it further here.

Hynkel's lover, Hannah, played by Chaplin's wife, Paulette Goddard, doesn't find Hynkel's attire and behavior strange at all. Instead, she loves him wholeheartedly. When he is driven out by the dictator, he begins to court her. Chaplin's shy and embarrassed demeanor is also memorable.

Hynkel, while barbering, mistakenly uses white paint on the faces of stormtroopers. This is like patting a fly on a tiger's head, offending them in a way that deserves death. From then on, that wonderful and unpredictable story unfolds.

After the barber is mistaken for the dictator, he meets Napaloni in the palace. One real, one fake, one spirited and lively, one understanding inside, intricately complicated, confusing everyone. When these two dictators are getting their hair cut in the palace, they refuse to yield to each other because the problem of whose chair should be raised higher proves impossible to solve.

The fake dictator appears to be making himself into a dictator on the surface, but inside he is extremely pained, extremely conflicted. In several scenes, he raises his right hand to salute, but his face is full of sorrow, almost about to cry.

Chaplin spent two years of effort making "The Great Dictator," determined not to create a shoddy product. He personally participated in everything from writing the script, directing, and scoring the music to designing the sets. Several of the great scenes in the film are unlike anything Chaplin had ever done in his previous films. Besides the first scene of the European War, as mentioned earlier, there are many other places where a lot of money was spent on making props and sets.

That new-style Tomainian cannon was specially made for this film. It measures 100 feet long, weighs 6,500 pounds, cost $15,000 U.S. dollars, and can fire shells just like a real cannon. It is the most expensive prop in "The Great Dictator."

The dictator's residence, the grand office, welcoming foreign heads of state like Napaloni, the lively scene at the train station, the welcoming crowds on both sides of the road, the grand banquet, the lavish and extravagant ballroom, and so on, are all lavish sets built regardless of cost. Who says that clowns don't need to spend a lot of money to act in comedies? Chaplin has truly boosted the morale of comedians everywhere.

Chaplin also had some twists and turns in naming this film "The Great Dictator," and in the end, he considered it a successful work. Initially, he wanted to name it "The Dictator," but 台難斯氏 had already used this name before, and the 百拉蒙 Company held the copyright to the name. If Chaplin wanted to use this name again, he would have to pay 百拉蒙 twenty-five thousand dollars. He managed to find a solution: he added the word "Great" above "Dictator" to differentiate it. Afterwards, he said to others, "I call my film "The Great Dictator"—completely free!"

Before "The Great Dictator" was released, Chaplin invited a reporter from the New York Times to visit. When the film showed Chaplin, who played the dictator, stepping into a 廠式 car, an officer ran over and saluted him. Then the camera panned out, and at least a hundred thousand people appeared on the screen, welcoming and shouting in a great scene.

The reporter asked Chaplin, "Where did you get this scene?"

Chaplin was very clever. He said, "Where did we get this scene? Guess where we got it from? It was filmed in Germany—my hired Fifth Column secretly filmed it in Germany. Hitler is not only the character I play. He's also paying for the production of my film. It saved me a lot of money. Isn't that strange?" (The End)

Sexual Health

### Love Problems and Marriage Safety Issues

— American Medical Doctor Huang Zhongchang

Regarding the study of marriage problems, the British 爱凯 has strongly advocated marriage based on love, condemning all marriages not based on love as immoral, and insisting that the establishment of a husband and wife relationship must be based on love in order to create a complete family; but on the other hand, he still advocates free marriage; if their love cools, they may separate and seek new love, which also shows that love cannot guarantee its perpetuity, it also shows that repeated love is inevitable, and it also shows the reason for the occurrence of female adultery.

Couples formed through mutual love seem to be able to be complete, but perhaps due to abnormal sexual organs, her sexual desire cannot be satisfied; or after living together for a long time, everyone is in contact with each other every day, exposing each other's shortcomings, causing spiritual dissatisfaction, then love gradually cools down, and cracks occur in the family, and then "varied sexual demands" occur, causing love to decrease day by day, resulting in tragedies such as divorce. The saying "Marriage is the tomb of love" is indeed correct. The best method of marriage, instead of marriage based on love, is to strive to cherish sexual health after marriage. What is sexual health? It is that the foundation of marriage is not only built on love, but also takes into account the actual issue of sexual desire. Academic achievement, temperament, and status can be used as conditions for varied love, but if after marriage, a sexual flaw is found in either party, then the initial love cannot be maintained permanently, and great disappointment will inevitably occur, leading to love for other people; therefore, love without sexual health as a backing rarely leads to a long life together, resulting in either divorce or adultery. However, the remedy for this kind of harm must use the latest science to be effective, because the dissipation of sexual energy is caused by damage to the pineal gland, which governs sexual desire, so the correct treatment method must be to take the German authentic testicular essence preparation for men "补体康". The ingredients of "补体康" are extracted from the testicles and ovaries of animals. It has an astonishing effect on premature aging, kidney deficiency, and inability to perform sexual acts. It can supplement the brain, kidneys, and blood. Elderly people who take it can rejuvenate. The female version can regulate menstruation and promote fertility. This has been clinically proven to be effective for a long time and is trusted by Chinese and foreign doctors. It can be said to be a specific medicine for kidney deficiency.

### Nocturnal Emission Is Most Tempted

— German Medical Doctor Zheng Ting

The motives of young people who commit self-pollution are mostly tempted by the outside world. They often go to public places or like to go to singing and dancing stages. Once they are fascinated by sights and sounds, they use self-pollution as a remedy, which is not uncommon. It is important to know that self-pollution is the greatest bad habit that damages brainpower and sexual function, and because there is no object, it can be done with a single thought, so it is easy to become an addiction. As it is committed for a long time, its harm gradually deepens. In recent years, people in the medical community have long been loudly appealing and warning young people not to consider self-pollution as feasible, but those who speak earnestly are ignored, and those who commit it increase day by day, which is considered a major threat to the health of young people.

The earliest symptom of self-pollution is nocturnal emission. Semen is the foundation of human health. If emissions are too frequent, hundreds of diseases will occur, which can lead to neurasthenia, incomplete development, weak brain and kidney deficiency. For the sake of health, treatment should be sought quickly. This can be treated with the German "耐而斯遗精片," which can stop it, but self-pollution must be stopped, and health preservation must be strictly observed, then the effectiveness of the medicine will be greater. Usually, do more work that is beneficial to your career, do not idle, and do not go to places where men and women are mixed. This is also a necessary way to prevent self-pollution.

### The Great Realization of Gonorrhea Treatment

— German Medical Doctor Wu Kechun

People who suffer from gonorrhea always feel at a loss when choosing medicine, because once it is treated incorrectly, there will be endless troubles. Acute cases turn into chronic cases, and chronic cases then develop complications such as orchitis and prostatitis, which can lead to infertility and physical disability, which is deeply regrettable.

In the field of gonorrhea treatment, after the transmembranous sterilization therapy was declared a failure, and the general chemical therapies were mostly unworthy of their name, and there were no valuable achievements for our clinical use, we buried ourselves in research, not knowing how much effort was spent. Fortunately, 利耳珂禾氏 and 林那塞氏 discovered the improved chemical therapy of gonorrhea: autogenous immune therapy. This method is used to inject into the human body to increase the patient's anti-gonococcal toxin, so that a large number of blood cells are produced in the blood to annihilate the gonorrhea hidden inside. This method has been recognized by doctors around the world. When German Doctor 彼德 came out, he went a step further and used the most precise scientific methods to make the gonorrhea oral medicine "克淋侬". After repeated animal experiments, it was confirmed that this medicine is a specific medicine for gonorrhea and has no side effects.

Because this method can increase the human body's anti-gonococcal toxin and white blood cells, this gonorrhea oral medicine can absolutely cure all acute and chronic gonorrhea in men and women, and there will be no adverse effects. The discovery of this "克淋侬" medicine is the realization of the ideal effect in gonorrhea treatment. In terms of external medicine, men can use "抗淋水" as a suppository, so that no matter how deep or shallow the gonorrhea is hidden, it can be completely eliminated and solved permanently.

### Gonorrhea Lecture

— Doctor Yao Juyan

Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, intersection of Sichuan Road

Gonorrhea Easily Leads to Neurasthenia

Neurasthenia caused by gonorrhea has many symptoms. Gonorrhea is most likely to damage reproductive function. Prostatitis, which we most often encounter, is often likely to turn sexual nerves into the possibility of sexual neurasthenia. Therefore, those who suffer from prostatitis must pay attention to this. From my 20 years of experience, people who are usually neurotic are particularly prone to this disease. Although the prostate gland is not very swollen, if palpation is performed, the patient will feel unbearable pain.

The fundamental and rapid treatment of gonorrhea must have a scientific basis, otherwise, no matter how well you say or write that it can be cured in three to five days, the facts are always the facts. Local surgery in general does not seem to have any effect, because the speed of gonorrhea's escape and its ubiquity are like mercury spilling on the ground, penetrating every pore, so to ask for a complete treatment method for gonorrhea, you must first make a comprehensive and precise plan to be effective. Here, based on my long experience, German static electricity therapy and X-ray therapy are the transcendent gonorrhea therapies in physical therapy, and the latest chemical preparation in gonorrhea oral medicine has an anti-gonococcal phage effect, which has the great power to surround and kill gonorrhea that is good at escaping. Stubborn gonorrhea can be fundamentally solved in a short period of time. It can also restore sexual nerves to their original health, which is unmatched by any gonorrhea therapy. Also treats syphilis, scrofula, chancroid, and sexual neurasthenia. Consultation hours: 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Starting today, 20 patients are sent for consultation every day, and each number only costs 50 cents.

### Secret to Coughing and Stopping Coughs

— Doctor Sheng Zaiqiang

Regardless of traditional Chinese medicine or Western medicine, cough is a difficult disease to treat, so lung disease is more common than any infectious disease, and its mortality rate is also alarming. Therefore, ordinary people should not think that a cold and cough is a minor illness and not treat it. If unfortunately, the cough becomes lung disease due to lack of treatment, then the patient should not be pessimistic. In fact, lung disease is not as terrible as generally thought by doctors. As long as you take care of yourself and treat it properly, there is nothing mysterious about it. According to my experience, "补肺拿尔" medicine has a special effect on relieving coughs and treating lungs. No matter if the disease is in the second or third stage with hemoptysis, taking this can absolutely cure it. However, during the recovery period, you should be quiet and avoid exertion, and eat more nutritious foods, so the disease will be easier to cure. This is the condition for the inevitable cure of pulmonary tuberculosis.

### Minister Chen of the Ministry of Education Announces Measures to Subsidize Food for Teachers and Students of National Schools, Approved by the Executive Yuan Meeting

(Chongqing Air Dispatch) Minister Chen of the Ministry of Education announced the following measures on November 13 regarding subsidies for food for teachers and students of national schools:

With the rise of the war and schools in the war zone suspended, the central government, in order to continue educational undertakings and maintain the studies of young people out of school in the war zone, on the one hand ordered colleges and universities to move to the rear to hold classes, and on the other hand established national secondary schools and Zhongshan secondary school classes to accommodate secondary school students. Furthermore, because poor students in the war zone have had their economic sources cut off, special loan measures have been formulated to prevent the majority of poor youth from dropping out of school. The original loan amount was set at 7-8 yuan per month, but due to different prices in various places, appropriate reductions were made as appropriate. In September of this year, the highest amount has been increased to 18 yuan, and this month it has been increased to 25 yuan. Recently, President Chiang and Vice President Kong have been concerned about the living conditions of teachers and students of various schools, and the Ministry of Education has stipulated subsidy measures. Food rice for teachers and students of national schools will be subsidized if the market price exceeds 50 yuan per stone. The food loan for poor students in the war zone and the food expenses for students of national normal schools will be calculated at 2.1 dou per person per month. If the market price of food rice in various places exceeds 50 yuan per market stone, the excess amount of the food loan will be reported by each school to the Ministry for approval of the standard, and then the actual expenditure will be reported to the Executive Yuan for additional appropriation. As for self-funded students of national schools, if the monthly food cost per person exceeds 18 yuan, if the family is unable to bear the excess amount within the approved standard of the food cost for loan students in the same area, the parents may request the school to issue a subsidized food loan. After the school examines and reports to the Ministry for approval, it will discretionarily lend the full amount or half of the excess amount for relief. These measures have been approved and implemented by the Executive Yuan, and the current food problem in various schools can be solved accordingly. In recent years, students in various schools have strived to reduce food expenses, and nutrition has often been insufficient, but they have been able to encourage themselves, strive to learn, and increase their sense of responsibility since the war. In the future, it is hoped that students of various schools will be kind to the government's love for youth, maintain the utmost sincerity of education, and deeply remember the hard lives of soldiers on the front line and the people in the rear, and work even harder to study hard and live up to expectations. It is also hoped that teachers and staff of various schools will be aware of the difficulties of the times, maintain the spirit of serving education in the past, continue to train and guide young people, and shoulder the responsibility of resisting the construction of the country. The future of education truly relies on this.

### The Circulation and Endorsement of Zhuang Tickets

— Nutao

1.  Overview

Zhuang tickets are promissory notes issued by money shops, promising a fixed amount, and unconditionally guaranteed for payment by the issuing money shop. They are a type of economic credit security, referred to by scholars as promissory securities. According to the classification in the Bills of Exchange Law, Zhuang tickets should be legally considered "promissory notes." However, Zhuang tickets originated with money shops and have a long history, dating back before the promulgation and implementation of the Bills of Exchange Law (October 30, 1929). Therefore, the industrial and commercial sectors continue to use the old name (Zhuang ticket) and have not changed the name to promissory note according to legal provisions. (However, in other ports, habits vary; for example, in Hankou, tickets under 100 yuan are called Zhuang tickets, while those over 100 yuan are called exchange tickets. The "Ping Tickets" of Guangzhou and the "Red Yao" of Yangzhou are all Zhuang tickets.) However, notes issued by banks that undertake to pay are generally called bank promissory notes and are abbreviated as "promissory notes." In terms of legal status, the two are equal. (Editor's note: Today, Zhuang tickets issued by Shanghai money shops are marked with the words "promissory note," in compliance with the provisions of the Bills of Exchange Law.)

The form of Zhuang tickets is generally similar, but not uniform. They are usually made of thick Xuan paper, mostly white, and sometimes printed with light-colored patterns. They are divided into sight drafts and time drafts. Sight drafts are payable upon presentation, while time drafts range from five to ten days (Article 41 of the Shanghai Money Trade Regulations stipulates a maximum of ten days). According to law, the amount of a sight draft that does not specify a payee must be at least 50 yuan (Article 10 of the Implementing Rules of the Bills of Exchange Law). However, in practice, the amounts are often large, up to hundreds of thousands or even millions. They are usually in bearer form. The first line is the number, the second line is the amount, the third line is the name of the issuing money shop (with a seal but no signature), and the fourth line is the date (sight drafts show the date of issue, while time drafts show the month and day of maturity without the word "maturity"). The overlapping part of the ticket is also numbered, and the amount, date, and overlapping part are stamped with detailed patterns. The size and style of the characters are not fixed and are determined by each money shop.

Money shops have a long history, and Zhuang tickets have an excellent reputation, even surpassing bank promissory notes. They can circulate freely in the domestic industrial and commercial sectors, and even foreign banks and trading houses are happy to accept them, trusting them more than bank promissory notes. In the past, when bank promissory notes were not yet commonly used, foreign banks and trading houses almost refused to accept anything other than Zhuang tickets in transactions with Chinese merchants. Therefore, the Shanghai industrial and commercial sectors commonly call Zhuang tickets "golden butterflies," able to fly all over the sky without any obstacles.

2.  Reasons for the Excellent Reputation of Zhuang Tickets

The nature, form, types, and position of Zhuang tickets in the financial world have been briefly described above. The reason why Zhuang tickets have been able to win the trust of society and gain the reputation of "golden butterflies flying all over the sky" is not accidental. The reasons can be found in the following points:

(1) Zhuang tickets are based on money shops, and payment is unconditionally guaranteed by the money shops. Money shops have a long history and held a leading position in the financial world of China in the past. Before the rise of modern banks, every commercial port and major city was sure to have several powerful money shops that controlled the economic lifeline of the entire city. Therefore, Zhuang tickets also circulated unhindered, and over time, the habit became deeper, and the trust of society became even more solid.

(2) Zhuang tickets are issued by money shops, and the money shops are the principal debtors of the Zhuang tickets. In the past, money shops were all sole proprietorships or partnerships (although some have recently been reorganized into limited liability companies in accordance with the Banking Law, partnerships are still by far the absolute majority, especially in other ports). Therefore, the capital owner or partners bear unlimited or joint and several unlimited liability, so the payment guarantee for Zhuang tickets seems to be more substantial.

(3) In Shanghai, exchange money shops are the elite of the money industry. The qualifications and procedures for "entering the garden" (joining the Shanghai Money Trade Association) are very strict, and their financial strength and reputation are very strong. Therefore, the Zhuang tickets they issue can naturally spread without being promoted.

(4) Historically, forgeries and counterfeit signatures of Zhuang tickets have been rare. Even if the issuing money shop unfortunately goes bankrupt, it must give priority to repaying the holders of Zhuang tickets, so they will not be implicated. This point is most trusted by society.

(5) Also, in Shanghai, the Shanghai Money Trade Regulations also stipulate: "…For current account customers who issue Zhuang tickets to money shops, whether they have already paid the money shop, bought goods, or discounted the tickets, if it is clearly confirmed that there are accounts to check, goods to point to, or that it is a case of embezzlement by a watchman or self-deception, the ticket holder shall not, at any time, request the money shop to report the loss and stop payment…" (See Article 45, Paragraph 1 of the revised regulations of the Shanghai Money Trade Regulations in 1933. However, it is not absolutely impossible to report a loss, but the conditions and procedures for reporting a loss are very strict.) It can be seen that holding a ticket is equivalent to obtaining cash, and there are very few disputes, so it is almost inevitable that it will be welcomed by people.

(6) Furthermore, because the acceptance (bank or commercial acceptance) and discounting of bills of exchange in China are still in their infancy, and the circulation of checks is not yet widespread, there is actually a great need for a type of negotiable currency. It is even more urgent for merchants to finance their capital. Now that Zhuang tickets were used habitually before bank promissory notes, they are easily circulated in society and surpass bank promissory notes.

(7) In addition, the Chinese industrial and commercial sectors have always preferred to be conservative, and although the new banks also have a "current account" department, the transaction procedures are ultimately more mechanical and meticulous than those of money shops. Therefore, the old-style or semi-modern industrial and commercial enterprises that occupy an absolute majority in various places are happy to deal with money shops. This is also one of the reasons why Zhuang tickets are popular.

3.  Customs and Laws Regarding Zhuang Tickets

Zhuang tickets are mostly in "bearer" form (referred to as "small header"), and because of their excellent credit, they can be transferred by delivery (i.e., the transfer of the ticket) and can be circulated without restriction. The person transferring the ticket confidently says that delivery of the Zhuang ticket is "reliable" (a Shanghai slang term), and the recipient is sure to accept it without doubt. This is no problem for Zhuang tickets that are genuine, and for this reason, Zhuang tickets can fly all over the sky.

However, with the multiple transfers of bearer instruments, it is often difficult to ascertain the original payer, and the amount of Zhuang tickets is often very large. Once a forgery or counterfeit signature occurs, the final holder of the ticket will inevitably be at a disadvantage. However, in practice, endorsements are not made when transferring the ticket. Therefore, the final holder of the ticket has no recourse against the "prior parties" (i.e., all those who previously participated in the transfer) except to negotiate with the party from whom he received the ticket. If we speak of safeguards, this is rather weak.

The fact that Zhuang tickets do not need to be endorsed for transfer is not only a custom, but also a legal provision. Bearer instruments can be transferred without endorsement under the law. In my opinion, both custom and law are inappropriate and worthy of discussion.

The only reason custom recognizes that Zhuang tickets do not need to be endorsed for transfer is that Zhuang tickets are golden butterflies with excellent credit, and there is no need for endorsement. However, commerce is becoming increasingly complex, and people's hearts are not as pure as they used to be. Without endorsement, there is much room for doubt. In fact, not to mention the past, recently a yarn store claimed that it had been defrauded of two double-horse yarn warehouse receipts (20 pieces) with counterfeit Zhuang tickets and published a notice in the newspaper declaring the two warehouse receipts invalid. Another yarn store claimed that it had legally purchased the yarn and that the counterfeit Zhuang tickets were not paid out by their store, so the warehouse receipts could not be declared invalid, and also published a notice in the newspaper to defend their position. Which side is right or wrong in this dispute is not for outsiders to judge arbitrarily, and it must be resolved by law. However, from this, it can be seen that this ticket must have been transferred many times, but the rights were transferred without endorsement, only by delivery of the ticket. Now that the issue of authenticity has arisen, the lack of endorsement is clearly felt to be inappropriate. If there had been endorsement, the method of negotiation could be determined, and the safeguards would be greatly increased.

As for the law, why does it not stipulate that bearer instruments must also be endorsed for transfer? Because possession is the key to proving the right to claim payment for bearer instruments. Whoever possesses the instrument is the payee, regardless of the previous transfer or source. There is also another legislative reason: no endorsement is required, which facilitates circulation and promotes the prevalence of negotiable currency. However, I believe that modern commerce is becoming increasingly complex, and bills of exchange are transferred many times. Although China has always valued morality and credit, there may be a mixture of good and bad. In order to prevent problems before they occur and to fairly resolve disputes, it seems appropriate to transfer by endorsement. Moreover, endorsement is not troublesome, and blank endorsement (i.e., only the signature of the endorser is required, without specifying the name of the endorsee) is very convenient. Requiring endorsement for transfer does not seem to affect the circulation of bills of exchange. Moreover, promissory notes are credit securities, not payment securities. Whether the promissory note itself is counterfeit cannot be absolutely certain. If the note is endorsed along the way, there will at least be a trace to follow, which seems to be beneficial and not harmful to the use of bills of exchange.

According to the provisions of the Bills of Exchange Law, there are four legally required conditions for a promissory note: (1) a statement that it is a promissory note; (2) a fixed amount; (3) an unconditional promise to pay; and (4) the date of issue. However, Chinese Zhuang tickets do not usually state that they are promissory notes (bank promissory notes do), nor do they have the phrase "unconditional promise to pay." Legally, this does not comply with the requirements. Therefore, once a dispute arises with a Zhuang ticket, whether the law recognizes it as a promissory note and is bound by the Bills of Exchange Law seems to be questionable. It is best to comply with the legal provisions.

Also, the "name" of Zhuang tickets is not universal or uniform in fact, and the customs of use vary from region to region. What inconvenience would this cause if Zhuang tickets were circulated in inter-port transactions! The above points are worthy of consideration by the money industry. In terms of legislation, the chapter on promissory notes in the Bills of Exchange Law seems to be too simple and has many points that need to be considered.

### China's Economic Construction During Wartime

— Weng Wenhao

The material in this article is extracted from Dr. Weng Wenhao, Minister of Economic Affairs, on the economic situation of China during wartime, as reported by the English-language "Wartime China Society." It describes the economic construction of China since the war in great detail. It is specially translated so that people who are concerned about the situation in the interior can understand a glimpse of the economic construction within China. Idle words

Before the July 7th Incident, the Chinese government had drafted a five-year plan to establish heavy industry. According to this plan, the establishment of heavy industry would be mainly in the three provinces of Henan, Hebei, and Jiangxi. After the outbreak of the war, due to practical needs, the government was forced to establish a solid economic fortress in the interior of the country. In the southwestern and northwestern provinces, the authorities worked hard to develop mining, electrical engineering, chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, and hydropower industries. Until recently, a three-year plan for mining construction was approved. The biggest goal of this plan is to promote the "self-reliance" of China's wartime economy, so as to achieve a state of "self-sufficiency."

Using the machinery relocated from Hanyeping and Daye Iron Works, the government established a large-scale refining plant in Sichuan Province. In addition, another steel mill under preparation is about to open in the same area. Yunnan Province also has a refining plant about to be established, but the main area for the development of the steel industry planned by the authorities is still in Sichuan Province.

New-style electric furnaces for auxiliary steelmaking have been widely installed throughout the southwest. In order to remedy the insufficient supply of pig iron, the authorities are actively purchasing privately-owned pig iron ore to increase the supply of pig iron. This year, the supply of pig iron in Sichuan and other areas of Free China has increased significantly. It is expected that in one year, the total production of iron and steel will be sufficient for wartime military and industrial needs.

The development of coal mines, under the active management of the government, has achieved great success. The rich coal seams discovered in Jiangxi, Henan, Sichuan, Shanxi, Yunnan, Gansu, and Xikang provinces are sufficient for the construction of new railways and industrial power. In order to solve the shortage of fuel, the government has established many new alcohol factories. In the vast territory of Free China, underground copper deposits have been exploited in large quantities. At the same time, the government has also established several new electric smelting plants. In addition, the mining of gold, mercury, antimony, zinc, and tungsten is also very active. The production of tin has increased rapidly in recent years. China still accounts for the world's leading share of antimony and tungsten. The large exports of tin, mercury, tungsten, and antimony in China's foreign trade prove the sharp increase in the production of these rare metals.

There are eleven large-scale hydropower companies, separately located in Henan, Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, Shanxi, and Gansu provinces. There are also three even larger hydropower companies currently under construction. Once completed, the electricity generated will flow throughout Free China, and the cost will be lower than that of urban hydropower companies.

During the first year after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, 168 machine and iron factories from the coastal areas moved to the interior. Their main tasks were: (1) manufacturing supplies; (2) manufacturing prime movers—such as various motors and generators; (3) manufacturing appliances; (4) manufacturing production tools; (5) manufacturing axles and other transportation tools.

In addition, the authorities' efforts to develop the electrical and chemical industries have also achieved remarkable results. Among the 28 newly established state-run electrical factories, they are currently working on the manufacture of telegraph parts. One of the machine factories, which originally specialized in the manufacture of electric fans, is now manufacturing military wireless telegraph machines day and night. Free China under the rule of the National Government has produced a large amount of thunderbolts, submarine telegraphs, vacuum tubes, military telephones, dry batteries, and other tools needed to transmit news. As for the chemical industry, there are 54 chemical factories that specialize in the manufacture of chemical raw materials. Their products, in addition to being used to manufacture matches and water douding, are directly used in the manufacture of military supplies.

The biggest goal of economic construction in wartime China is to increase exports and achieve self-sufficiency in domestic production, without relying on imports of foreign goods. In the long-term war, China's foreign trade has entered a new stage. The government is providing as much as possible for the needs of international trade to strengthen the domestic financial structure, and at the same time, it is also increasing the purchasing power of the domestic people. As long as our own heavy industry has not yet been fully developed, increasing foreign exports is essential. China's exports can be classified into the following five categories: (1) Agricultural products—such as silk, tea, cotton, peanuts, vegetable oil, and sesame; (2) Forest products—such as tung oil; (3) Livestock products—such as eggs, egg products, pig bristles, wood, sheepskins, hides, leather bags, etc.; (4) Mineral products—such as tin, antimony, tinplate, etc.; (5) Handicraft products—such as embroidery, silk fabrics, etc. The total annual value of imports of each of these categories is tens of millions of yuan or more. In order to promote the development of foreign exports, the National Government has formulated three principles: improving production methods, providing production loans, and direct government operation. Tungsten, tin, mercury, tung oil, steel, wool, tea, and wood will be exported directly by the government. The annual import value of these products is around 600,000 yuan. If the government actively manages them, it is expected that there will be continued increases in the near future. Tungsten production has tripled in the past two years. Tin production has also seen amazing development recently. Tung oil was not self-sufficient before the war, but now it has become one of China's main export products.

Before the incident, although China was an agricultural country, it still had to import 2% of foreign rice to make up for the shortage of domestic production. In recent years, due to bumper harvests in various parts of the interior, there is no longer a lack of rice. As long as transportation methods can be improved, Free China under the rule of the National Government no longer needs to rely on foreign imports for food.

The increase in clothing raw materials should also not be ignored. Cotton production can be self-sufficient during wartime. According to reliable estimates, the national cotton production in 1937 reached more than 12 million dan. In addition to self-sufficiency, there is also a considerable amount available for export. But what still causes us unlimited regret is that China's main cotton-producing areas have fallen into the hands of the Japanese. In the southwestern corner, the cotton production has always been very low in recent years and is not enough for self-sufficiency. The supply of fiber used for textiles in the area is also insufficient. In order to remedy this shortcoming, the government has been working to improve cotton seeds in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces, and has also been transporting its surplus cotton from Hebei, Shanxi, and Henan provinces to the southwest, so that the textile factories in the southwest corner will not have to worry about a shortage of raw materials.

The government has recently been working hard to increase cotton production and support the development of handicrafts in the interior. Since 1938, it has earnestly implemented the plan to mobilize refugees from the war zones to participate in land reclamation, with areas covering the five provinces of Yunnan, Henan, Guangxi, Jiangxi, and Fujian. According to accurate statistics, 310,000 refugees have reclaimed 5.4 million mu of barren and undeveloped land. The Central China, Communications, Agricultural, and Farmers Banks and the Agricultural Credit Administration have provided large amounts of soft loans for land reclamation.

On the other hand, the economic blockade against Japan, which has been implemented for the past three years, has been very effective. This blockade is continuing to be implemented, and the results have been significant. The Japanese dream of "using war to support war" has also been severely dealt with by our authorities, making it impossible for them to achieve their goals.

First, on August 7, 1939, the National Government promulgated the regulations prohibiting the export of goods from various places, stipulating that two categories of goods were within the scope of the prohibition. The first category is raw materials for the manufacture of military supplies, such as coal, salt, mineral products, cotton, etc. The second category, although it cannot be directly used for the manufacture of military supplies, can be exported by the enemy to third countries in exchange for foreign currency to strengthen their domestic financial structure. This category includes hides, wool, pig bristles, soybeans, etc. According to reports from military and political authorities and customs officials, in the past, only 60 or so types of exported goods were simultaneously transported to Japan. In order to prevent this phenomenon from continuing to exist, the authorities specially established a water and land transportation office to resolve this matter, and ordered all responsible departments to purchase a large amount of the above two categories of goods within Free China to prevent unscrupulous people from secretly smuggling them out. From whatever point of view, the measures taken by the authorities to vigorously prevent the Japanese from utilizing our country's resources in the occupied areas and at the front have been very effective.

Although the total value of China's exports to Japan in 1938 was 116 million yuan, it decreased to 66 million yuan in 1939. In order to make up for the losses caused by smuggling, the authorities have established a regulation to boycott Japanese goods. This regulation includes goods manufactured by factories in Japanese-occupied areas, the imperial mainland, and its colonies. This is a practical and effective method of boycott, making it impossible for the Japanese to exchange their products for legal tender, purchase foreign exchange to obtain raw materials needed for production, and reduce the scope of their foreign markets.

Together with the movement to boycott Japanese goods, the government is paying close attention to the issue of national daily necessities and supplies. The government is now actively supporting the development of small factories and handicrafts, so that the people will not buy cheap Japanese goods. I believe that the best way to do this is to increase the production of our domestic products.

Turning back to the movement to boycott Japanese goods, it is no longer limited to a corner of mainland China. Among the 10 million overseas Chinese in the Nanyang Islands, this movement has also begun, and it has been very successful. Today, all parts of the world are responding and dealing a fatal blow to the Japanese goods market. What is worth our encouragement is that peace-loving countries such as Britain, the United States, India, and Australia are currently conducting a long-term economic war against Japan to expand the scope of this movement and jointly boycott the invasion of Japanese goods.

In addition to this, our government has also launched a fierce guerrilla war in the Japanese-occupied areas to undermine the economic foundation of the Japanese. As a result of the inability of the occupied areas to be fully controlled, the total value of goods imported by Japan into the occupied areas in 1939 reached 210 million yuan. Compared with 150 million yuan in 1937 and 200 million yuan in 1938, this is an amazing increase.

I must clearly point out that this increase in manufacturing is a pathological phenomenon for Japan's entire foreign exports. Because the more Japan exports to the occupied areas, the more Japan reduces its exports to other places. They can only obtain Japanese yen and counterfeit currency, but cannot obtain the foreign exchange they need. The outwardly strong but inwardly weak Japan urgently needs foreign exchange to purchase raw materials for industrial manufacturing. Therefore, the current surge in Japanese exports to the coastal provinces of China is tantamount to making large investments in its occupied areas for the foreign exchange it could have obtained. We can assert that this investment by Japan will not be profitable unless they adjust the economic situation in the occupied areas, actively develop natural resources, and increase total production, so as to maintain the continuous rotation of Japanese industry.

In summary, the surge in Japanese exports to China is clearly a burden that weakens its national power. The destructive policies implemented by our government in the occupied areas have dealt an infinite blow to the Japanese warlords' dreams of carrying out any construction projects in the areas they occupy.

### Answer to Mr. Jiang Xun

— Editor

(1) Regarding the Sino-Foreign Exchange's listed rates for the four-part official, commercial, and semi-commercial use, Shanghai has neither listed them nor applied for a liaison office.

(2) Tax exemptions on imports must be approved by the Ministry of Finance; Customs is the implementing agency.

(3) Transferring British gold to the United States; if it were in the UK, approval would be obtained, and it would be paid at the official rate (4 yuan and 2 fen). Buying and selling British and American currencies in the United States follows the free pound exchange rate. In Shanghai, British and American currencies cannot be directly settled; in other words, one must sell British pounds at the market rate and then buy US dollars at the market rate. (Based on current Shanghai British and American foreign exchange market conditions, the exchange rate of British pounds to US dollars is only 3 yuan and 56 jiao per pound, while in New York it is above 4 yuan.)

(4) To the best of my knowledge, there seem to be few books specifically publishing regulations for war-time consumer cooperatives.

### Financial Review

— Sheng Kaiqiong

—November 23rd—

In terms of exports, Shanghai has also been profoundly affected by the European war. For example, trade with Germany has been completely severed, and trade with countries such as Belgium and the Netherlands has also been greatly reduced; the figures for the first ten months of this year are only one percent of last year's. However, considering the overall export trade, the changes in exchange rates, and the development of trade with various Asian regions such as British India, Burma, Hong Kong, the Dutch East Indies, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand, as well as the leap in trade with countries such as the UK and the US, good trade results are still evident. Except for January, exports rose from 72.9 million yuan in February to 93.7 million yuan in April. After May, due to the easing of exchange rates, which was unfavorable to exports, exports decreased from 151.7 million yuan in May to 98.7 million yuan in July. From August onwards, foreign exchange generally tightened, and export trade increased again from 120 million yuan in August to 135 million yuan in October.

Studying Shanghai's trade situation over the past ten months, it can be divided into three stages: the first stage is from January to April, the second stage is from May to July, and the third stage is from August to October. The situation in each stage is shown in the table. The evolution of these three stages of trade can be seen from the analysis in the previous two sections, which shows that the international situation has a very significant impact on trade. However, there is another issue, which is the connection between trade and exchange rates. According to the statistics, in the second and third stages, exports decreased and imports increased due to the easing of exchange rates, and then exports increased and imports decreased due to the tightening of exchange rates. In the first stage, as exchange rates fluctuated slightly, export trade also gradually increased, but import trade did not decrease but intensified, which seems inconsistent with the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on trade. In fact, it can be explained as follows: the slight fluctuation of exchange rates in the first stage was anticipated by everyone. To prevent future tightening of exchange rates, importers declared imports while exchange rates were favorable. However, after May, no one could predict whether exchange rates would ease or tighten, so exchange rates completely dominated the progress and retreat of trade, which was due to seasonal factors, thus forming an abnormal phenomenon.

What will be the trend of Shanghai's trade in the future? Although it is impossible to make wild guesses, the trade situation will certainly change due to the influence of the international situation. The evolution of the exchange market influenced by the international situation is also an important factor dominating Shanghai's trade situation, which is beyond doubt. (End)

Slight Fluctuations in Sugar Prices

Yesterday, the sugar market remained quiet, lacking any improvement. The association quoted spot prices for No. 24 coarse white sugar at 71 yuan and 8 jiao for the end of the month delivery from foreign warehouses, an increase of only 1 jiao. BS Mark Dutch refined white sugar was at 70 yuan, a decrease of 5 jiao from the previous day (21st). There were no transactions for Taikoo granulated white sugar at the high end; only HX Mark had some transactions, priced at 68 yuan and 3 jiao (goods from the East Warehouse) with no changes.

Xinghua Longans Are Expected to Arrive Continuously

Since the first batch of Xinghua longans arrived in small quantities, subsequent shipments have been lacking due to extreme transportation difficulties. According to news from Xinghua currency, customers have telegraphed to insure against marine risks, and the goods are expected to be shipped soon and should arrive in Shanghai in the near future. However, overseas expenses continue to increase, resulting in higher costs, making it difficult to offer low prices. Furthermore, goods transported via miscellaneous routes incur special expenses, causing prices to rebound by 20 to 30 yuan.

Cheap Eastern Shrimp is Affecting Other Goods

Recently, with the arrival of many Eastern shrimp, Chaozhou-edged shrimp is sold for 370 yuan, Yuan Dong-edged shrimp for 330 yuan, and a final price of 300 yuan. Therefore, other shrimp are greatly suppressed, with no market to speak of. New shipments of Annam shrimp have arrived in Hong Kong, but due to roundabout routes, overseas expenses are higher, with Hong Kong prices around 80 yuan. Offering them in Shanghai would require a price of 400 yuan, making it difficult to sell in the Shanghai market at this price, causing various firms to wait and see and not dare to get involved.

Jellyfish Skin and Jellyfish Heads Are Both Seeing High Prices

Due to difficult transactions and very thin inventories in Shanghai, Ningbo-produced jellyfish skin and jellyfish heads are seeing further price increases. Yesterday, jellyfish skin in the market rose to 110 yuan, and jellyfish heads rose to 85 yuan. The market situation remains tight.

Spring and Autumn

### "Princess" as Dance Partner

— Wansui

When I read the advertisement "Princess as Dance Partner," I thought it was the prelude to another Hollywood movie like "Affairs of a Royal Court"—a princess, unwilling to endure the loneliness of the palace, quietly leaves the capital to work as a dancer in a certain cafe. One evening, she meets a young gentleman, and they fall in love at first sight. After several twists and turns, they become a couple. But after reading on, my "assumption" was completely wrong! Our princess is not in Hollywood but right here in Shanghai, China; and she is not a shadow on the screen but "of noble birth"! Although the gimmicks on the "isolated island" are constantly changing, is there anything more novel and exciting than a princess condescending to work as a dance partner?

Since "folk tale" movies have become popular, our romantic young men have been overwhelmed with "invitations" and have started advertising for lawyers. Then, in this "once-in-a-lifetime opportunity," shouldn't they come together and show off their skills? A secret garden engagement cannot compare to a princess tossing a silk ball!

The so-called "grand opening yesterday, packed with people" is certainly not an exaggeration. Those future sons-in-law will not be stingy with a mere two-yuan admission ticket; moreover, those who "cherish the heart of protecting flowers" are ten, hundred, or even a thousand times more than romantic young men.

Unfortunately, our princess has presented a difficult problem: ten yuan per dance, two hundred for sitting at the table, five hundred for going out—this is just the "starting point." To achieve the "championship" of winning the silk ball, the "advertisement" does not even specify a clear amount but vaguely says "it would be an honor to receive more care and guidance." The "dignity of a princess" is probably expressed here. Sons-in-law who want to "climb the dragon and attach to the phoenix" should first look at the checks under their feet; otherwise, lawyer advertisements may not be legally effective.

### Expanding the Rat Eradication Campaign

— Bai Xi

Plague, also known as the Black Death, is a terrible infectious disease, spreading rapidly and with a high mortality rate. It usually prevails in port cities. Before an outbreak, rats must first become infected. Plague bacteria are transmitted from rats to humans via fleas, hence the name plague.

The symptoms of plague can be divided into bubonic plague, pneumonic plague, and septicemic plague, with bubonic plague of the inguinal lymph nodes being the most common and pneumonic plague being the most dangerous. The general symptoms mainly include heart failure, hemorrhagic inflammation, and severe neurological symptoms, which are caused by the toxins of plague bacteria. The mortality rate of bubonic plague is 30 to 90 percent, and those infected with pneumonic plague rarely survive. Those who recover from the disease have immunity, but their health does not easily recover, so there is a possibility of dying from a sudden severe illness—namely, plague exhaustion.

When the plague is prevalent, disinfection is extremely important. Patients must be strictly isolated, and the epidemic area cannot be connected with the outside world. If necessary, houses and equipment must be burned to prevent the spread of the epidemic. In addition, preventive vaccinations can be used, injecting plague serum or bacterial solution to prevent infection.

The plague originated in Europe and has spread widely. In our country, the northeastern provinces are often epidemic due to the transmission of marmots. Recently, plague was discovered in Ningbo. Shanghai and Ningbo are close and have frequent transportation, so people are quite concerned that the plague may invade Shanghai. The Jianghai Customs is also paying close attention to this and has formulated measures to quarantine ships from eastern Zhejiang, berthing at Wusong for strict inspection and fumigation disinfection to prevent the intrusion of plague bacteria.

The fundamental method of preventing plague must start with every household, regularly maintaining the cleanliness of rooms, sweeping away dust and debris, and simplifying indoor equipment to make it easy to move, so that rats and fleas have nowhere to hide. If rats are found indoors, they must be caught and killed as soon as possible. Recently, the Public Works Department is working hard to kill rats. The Health Department of the bureau has a rat-catching section, and citizens can request the department to send personnel to catch rats at any time. According to statistics from the Public Works Department, the department receives requests from citizens to kill more than 30,000 rats per month.

In order to eradicate the vector of plague transmission and protect the health of citizens, the rat eradication campaign needs to be expanded and promoted. We hope that the concession authorities will use propaganda to raise the awareness of most citizens about plague prevention and mobilize together to kill rats. In the midst of the plague epidemic, this is a very meaningful task.

The Hawthorne Case

### Where Does the Dance Queen End Up?

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter 12 Report and Explanation

Hawthorne and I rushed to the hospital, and after some negotiation, someone led us into Li Zhiban's ward. In the ward, besides Ni Jinshou, there was also a female nurse dressed in white. Both of them looked solemn and tense. The old man lay on the bed, covered with a white sheet. The old man closed his eyes, opened his mouth, and gasped heavily and rapidly, with two red spots on his cheeks.

Ni Jinshou said to Hawthorne in a low voice, "He was like this when I arrived. He hasn't said a word. His eyes opened once, saw me, and then closed immediately."

Hawthorne looked at the old man and said in a low voice, "His fever seems very high. I suppose it's unlikely he'll be able to talk?"

When Hawthorne said the last sentence, his gaze shifted to the female nurse's face. The nurse was very alert and immediately shook her head, answering Hawthorne's indirect question. I saw the old man's eyes slowly open, but his pupils seemed to have lost their ability to focus, only staring blankly at the ceiling above before closing again.

Ni Jinshou said to Hawthorne, "It doesn't matter much if he can't talk. Song Quan has already explained the details of his stabbing very clearly."

Hawthorne nodded and said, "That's good. But I hope he can talk, not only to report the details of being stabbed, but also to explain his stabbing."

Ni Jinshou was slightly stunned, his surprised eyes staring at Hawthorne. He didn't know yet that Li Zhiban was the real culprit who killed Wang Lilan. His surprise was natural.

Hawthorne answered Ni Jinshou's unspoken question: "Yes, he is the real culprit in this case. But that doesn't matter much. I can imagine his actions. I think this old man is useless. There's no point in us staying here. You should quickly send a telegram to Suzhou, telling his son, Li Shouqi, to come quickly."

Ni Jinshou nodded and said, "Speaking of Li Shouqi, I have to tell you. The Suzhou police station's reply has already arrived. Li Shouqi was indeed in Suzhou by lunchtime yesterday, the eighteenth. He is still in Suzhou today." (176)

### Shanghai in the Autumn of 1940

— Ge Quan

(1)

Characters: A crab merchant and a crab buyer. (A crab buyer approaches a crab stall, looks into the largest tank, shakes his head, and is about to leave...) Merchant: Sir! These all have green backs and white bellies, full of fat and roe, and the prices are very cheap, only one yuan and two mao each; there are also large ones inside...

Buyer: (Cannot help but sigh) It's not that it's expensive...

(2)

Characters: A poor man and a shop assistant.

(A long line of hungry people in front of a cheap rice shop, with a rope around it and people standing outside the rope, holding whips in their hands.)

Assistant: (Looking smug) Are you starving to death? Hurry up!

(The poor man hurriedly trembles and hands over a five-fen auxiliary coin.)

Assistant: Damn! Who ate ginseng soup and made you so slow! (Casually throws it on the ground)

Poor Man: (Hurriedly picking it up) Sir! Have pity on me, I've been standing here for an hour, and my family...

### Vitamins and Appearance

— Li

Getting enough vitamins every day can improve your appearance.

To get real beauty, good beauty products are very helpful, and it is also important to maintain good health, because with good health, you will have clean, flawless skin, healthy, white teeth, no respiratory diseases, and no bad temper.

To maintain good health, you must absorb enough vitamins every day. The following foods are very effective for maintaining health and improving appearance.

1. Milk: Drink half a pound or a pound every day.

2. Eggs: It's better to eat two every day if you can.

3. Fruits: Such as oranges and apples, are very good foods.

4. Grains: Such as bread, eat in the morning or as a snack in the afternoon.

5. Vegetables: Eat at least one type of vegetable every day.

6. Lettuce: Eat once a day.

The above six foods are formulated based on the vitamin A, B, C, and D needed by each person, because these four vitamins have the following functions:

Vitamin A can grow the mucous membranes of the respiratory and digestive organs, resist diseases, and promote eye health, improve eyesight, and help growth.

Vitamin B is very beneficial to the nervous system and greatly assists in the development of the body. Vitamin C can produce the inner lining of blood vessels and joints, which is very important for the health of teeth and gums, and indirectly can produce a beautiful personality.

Vitamin D manages the regulation of calcium and phosphorus in the human body. If vitamin D is lacking, it is enough to promote tooth decay and rickets. Vitamin D is also known as sunlight vitamin, because in the past it was easy for people to get sunlight. Modern buildings obstruct sunlight, so we have to get this needed vitamin D from food. Milk, eggs, and cod liver oil all contain appropriate amounts of vitamin D.

### How to Protect the Beauty of Your Hands

— Qin

Because a housewife operates the housework, it is very easy for the hands to become rough, so protecting the skin of the hands is a very urgent task.

You can try the following method:

First, use a good cream, and after washing your hands, apply it to the surface and back of your hands, and then rub your elbows to make the skin soft. If you have enough time, then you can implement the following actions:

(1) Rest your elbow on a table or other place, straighten your fingers, and rub alongside the straightened fingers with the other hand, just like wearing a very tight glove.

(2) Straighten your hands and shake them from side to side, the faster the better.

(3) Make a fist with your hands, then release them, doing this continuously and quickly for two minutes.

(4) Use your fingers to make a piano-playing gesture (just like you are playing the piano), and move your fingers as fast as possible.

The above methods can make the blood move, promote the metabolism of the skin, and undoubtedly, the skin of the hands can also be delicate, but you must have considerable perseverance to be effective.

### Several Incorrect Beauty Practices

— Man Yun

If you also have this kind of mistake

Please try to correct it and see the results

Several Chinese women who truly understand the art of beauty have very good beauty results, but many women often cannot get good results because of some beauty mistakes. The following points are especially common.

(1) You should apply rouge before applying face powder, so that the color of the rouge will be more harmonious and even. Many women apply face powder first and then rouge, but this procedure is actually wrong.

(2) When applying rouge, you should apply it to the lower eyelids and apply it towards the nose, gradually fading from dark to light, so that the mistake of revealing a white line between the cheeks and the lower eyelids can be avoided.

(3) Many women love to use white face powder, but in fact, only women with white skin can use white face powder. For those with slightly yellow complexions, the color of the face powder used should be deeper than the color of the skin. If a woman with dark skin uses white face powder, it will naturally not be harmonious.

(4) The method of applying powder, in general, is to start from the nose and apply it to the cheeks, but this method is wrong, and the result often makes the nose particularly shiny. The correct procedure for applying powder is to apply it to the cheeks first, starting from the ears, and finally apply it to the nose.

(5) The most beautiful form of eyebrows is to bend slightly upwards in the middle, which can harmonize with the shape of the eyes. Many people draw their eyebrows into an arc, which cannot produce the most beautiful form.

(6) Before applying rouge and face powder, you should use Vanishing Cream as a base. Some women use Cold Cream, but Cold Cream is used to protect the skin at night and should be wiped off in the morning.

### Methods of Protecting the Skin

— Yi

To make beauty work produce beautiful results, protecting the skin cannot be ignored. You can use cleansing cream or cold cream on the palms and fingertips every night before going to bed. Follow the method below, and after a while, your skin will definitely be very smooth and tender.

1. Rub from the chin to the ears. 2. Rub from the nose to the cheekbones. 3. Rub from the center of the eyebrows upwards to the forehead. 4. Rub around the eyes. 5. Rub downwards on the nose. 6. Rub on the neck and shoulders, then from the back to the end of the hair.

You can refer to the picture on the left to perform the rubbing. You can also use the same method when removing cleansing cream or cold cream.

Neck Massage

The skin of the neck also needs considerable protection. When massaging, you can straighten your neck, and when you turn your head to the right, you can massage the left side of your neck. When you want to massage the right side of your neck, your head should turn to the left. As for when massaging, you can refer to the picture on the left.

### Rest Before Beauty

— Added

Before starting beauty work, sufficient rest is very important. A woman should never come back from the tennis court and immediately put on a new dress to attend a banquet. She must first take a bath; otherwise, her appearance will definitely not be beautiful. At the same time, every woman should have a little time each day to engage in beauty work. This can also be said to be a right that every woman should have.

Here's a method that readers may want to try. It is sure to have good results and doesn't require a lot of time.

If your time doesn't allow you to take a bath first (it's better if you can), you can sit on the armchair in front of your dressing table, first wash your face once with hot water, then lean your head on the back of the chair, close your eyes, abandon all thoughts, and rest quietly for five minutes. You can eat a piece of candy in your mouth. After five minutes, you can open your eyes and start your beauty routine. The result will definitely be a fresh and delicate appearance.

This method is not invented by the author but is recorded in the decoration textbook written by Ms. Alma, an ornament expert in New York.

### Some Basic Knowledge About Beauty Products

(1) The lids of all creams, powder boxes, and rouge should be tightly closed immediately after use. This can prevent the fragrance from dissipating and can also prevent messiness.

(2) Never apply beauty products in front of others, especially in front of men, because when a man sees a woman's incomplete appearance before applying beauty products, it is easy to create a bad impression.

(3) Never borrow other people's beauty products, because beauty products are absolutely personal. Borrowing beauty products from others will definitely be disliked by others. Moreover, the color of the beauty products used by each person is absolutely different. Borrowing from others is not a good method either.

(4) When you have guests at home, it is best to prepare some beauty products for them, specifically for their use. This shows the thoughtfulness of the host and the thoroughness of the hospitality.

### Health is a Condition of Beauty

— Abridged translation of The Woman

Beauty is based on health. A woman with vigorous blood and no hidden illnesses is bound to be alluring throughout her body. Furthermore, with the help of cosmetics and beauty methods, one can undoubtedly reach a stage of perfect health and beauty. Therefore, early rising and early sleep, moderation in diet, regular exercise, and avoidance of irritating foods are all things that those who want to embark on the path to health and beauty should pay attention to.

### Reflections on Beauty

— Wang

After women have been active in society for some time, or worked hard in the family, they often neglect themselves too much. Their most valuable asset—beauty—is severely damaged. The smooth and delicate skin of a young girl begins to show gradually enlarged pores; the scalp is dry and scaly; the hands lose their slenderness, and the skin color is not pleasing. The way to remedy this is to first abandon this attitude of neglecting oneself. If it is inconvenient to go to an expensive beauty salon, in addition to various famous cosmetics, you can also use the help of natural products to regain your beauty.

Do you want to know what kind of natural substances will contribute the most to you? If your skin is oily, eggs and milk can give you special help; the egg's contents are cleansing and firming, while milk can prevent pores from enlarging, cheese can make the skin soft and white, and sour milk can clear pimples on the skin. As for lemon, it has astringent and bleaching properties. Yeast is extremely nutritious and has special effects on dry skin, as does olive oil. Before implementing the following beauty methods, the face must be washed clean, not only to the jawline, but also to the neck and shoulders, and then use a warm or hot towel to relax the face, so that the skin can receive the benefits of the subsequently applied substances.

Egg Beauty Method: Very beneficial for normal or slightly oily skin. Separate the egg white from the yolk, mix it evenly, spread it all over the face and neck, and after it dries, apply a layer of egg yolk, alternating the application until one egg is used up. When the last layer is dry, wipe it off with a hot towel and gently massage the skin, but do not rub hard.

Egg, Honey, and Almond Powder Beauty Method: This is a method to make the skin soft and white. It requires the egg white of one egg, mixed with one spoonful each of almond powder and honey. Spread this wonderful blend evenly on the face and wipe it off with a hot towel after it dries.

Yeast, Milk, and Water Beauty Method: This method is specifically for treating dry skin. Use two pieces of yeast, plus equal amounts of milk and water, to mix into a fine and even paste. Before applying, first apply clean cheese to the face, wipe off the excess, leaving only a very thin layer, and then apply the yeast paste to the face and neck. After ten minutes of drying, wash it off with hot water.

Cream Beauty Method: Mix half a cup of cream with an appropriate amount of grain flour to form a paste, apply it to the face, and continue to add cream to keep it moist. After half an hour, wipe it off with a hot towel. This method can make the skin soft.

Sour Milk Complexion Enhancing Method: This method can maintain complexion for at least several nights; frequent implementation can also clear acne and pimples. Simply apply sour milk to the face before going to bed, and do not wipe it off after it dries, but wash off the remaining layer with soap and water in the morning.

Lemon Juice Astringent Method: Wrap a small piece of ice in a soaked gauze, dip it in some filtered lemon juice, and gently rub the face and neck to shrink pores and refresh the skin. Those with excessively large pores can do this every morning after washing their face. If lemon makes the skin feel dry, you can use ice alone, but don't forget to wrap it in gauze and not rub the skin directly.

Hair Protection Method: For those with dry hair or dandruff, put half of olive oil and half of castor oil in a bottle and shake vigorously to blend them together. After combing the hair for a considerable time, this mixed oil can be used with the fingertips to rub into the scalp, and then use a wrung-out hot towel to moisten the hair, so that the oil lines are loosened, and then wrap it with a towel or silk scarf overnight, so that the oil can fully penetrate into the scalp.

### Teenage Girls and Beauty

— Fangfei

A teenage girl, when she reaches the age of sixteen, should consider her beauty issues. In fact, even a twelve- or thirteen-year-old girl can start paying attention to her hair and eyebrows.

In Hollywood, there are three young stars, namely Virginia Weidler, Ann Gillis, and Joan Carroll, who are already very mindful of their beauty issues. Virginia brushes her hair every morning and evening. Ann is very annoyed by the freckles on her face. Now her mother is trying to give her lemon juice and cold cream every day, which has reduced them a lot. Joan is very careful about her teeth, skin, and nails.

A girl who is not yet twenty years old cannot do too much when implementing beauty treatments, so Joan's mother only gives her a small amount of facial powder and applies some moisturizing ointment to her lips. Every night, she applies petroleum jelly to her eyelashes and eyebrows to give them a glossy color. Her hands are protected with fine creams, and her nails are trimmed fairly short, with pure white nail polish on top. She brushes her teeth three times a day and rubs her face with cream once a week, so her appearance is quite beautiful.

### Basic Knowledge About Hair Physiology

— Manyun

Hair occupies a very important position in the overall appearance. Sometimes, the shortcomings of the facial contours can be concealed by the style of the hair. In fact, there is a lot of research value in the various aspects of hair. Dr. Wright, a professor at Colgate University in the United States, once published the following materials in the "American Weekly":

(1) Will your hair turn white overnight? No, although many substances can turn hair white, it is definitely not possible to make it turn white automatically immediately, because hair is not a living fatty tissue. Unless the pigment at the root of the hair is destroyed, the hair of elderly people turns white because their hair grows from roots without pigment.

(2) Is hair alive? Hair, except for the roots, is not alive. Therefore, to make hair beautiful, the scalp where the hair roots remain should receive adequate nutrition.

(3) Approximately how much hair is there? It is said that a person has a total of 104,000 hairs, but this is an average number, and there are definitely more or less.

(4) Will frequently shaving the hair make it grow faster? No, because the act of shaving does not affect hair growth at all, but after shaving, the regrown hair will appear coarser, because the tip of the hair has been shaved off.

(5) How many years can each hair stay on the head? On average, a hair can stay on the head for four to seven years. The root of the hair grows in a follicle. If this follicle enters a refined state, then the hair will fall out, but after this hair falls out, another hair will grow out of the follicle. Eyelashes fall out most easily; the life of an eyelash is probably four to five months.

(6) Is there a difference in hair growth between day and night? Yes, the speed of hair growth is faster during the day than at night, and it also grows faster in summer than in winter.

(7) Does worry affect hair growth? Worry has a great impact on the health of the whole body, which naturally indirectly affects hair growth.

(8) Does hair growing on the forehead not indicate stupidity? No, the height of hair growth has nothing to do with a person's intelligence.

### Several Proper Steps to Implement Beauty Work

— Qin

Based on years of research by Hollywood beauty expert Westmore, the following beauty steps have been formulated:

1. Apply cleansing cream to the face, applying it with upward motions, wait a moment, and then remove the cleansing cream with cotton cloth. At this time, the dirt in the skin pores can be removed.

2. Dip your fingers in beauty base cream and apply it evenly to the face as a foundation. (This cream is Vanishing Vream; various beauty products have different names. Translator's note.)

3. Apply rouge, liquid or powder, to the cheeks.

4. Apply eye shadow cream to the upper eyelids.

5. Apply appropriately colored powder to the face, applying it from the side near the ears towards the nose. Before applying the powder, you must first check whether the base cream, rouge, and eye shadow cream are applied perfectly.

6. Use a small brush to brush off excess powder on the edges of the hairline.

7. Then, use an eyebrow pencil to draw eyebrows, slightly lengthening them according to the natural shape of the eyebrows.

8. Apply mascara to the eyelashes, using an upward method for the upper eyelashes and a downward posture for the lower eyelashes.

9. At this time, you can see if the color of the rouge is moist and even. If necessary, you can reapply an appropriate amount of rouge.

10. Apply lipstick to the lips.

### Miscellaneous Knowledge

— Weimin

The U.S. Public Health Service and the Health Museum have provided the following materials to promote physical health. They can also be used as a reference for beauty work and are also very useful common knowledge.

(1) Bad breath cannot be removed with mouthwash. Bad breath is indeed a major obstacle in social settings. It is emitted from inside the body, sometimes because there are decaying food scraps remaining in the mouth or between the teeth. The proper method is to remove these food scraps, sometimes requiring the help of a dentist.

(2) Perming hair will not increase hair density, because each hair has its root, so it will never be affected by external influences and increase hair density.
