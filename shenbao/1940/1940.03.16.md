Chongqing: Since the Japanese suffered encirclement and annihilation by the Chinese in Shanglin and Binyang in southern Guizhou, resulting in tens of thousands of casualties, they have repeatedly resorted to spreading rumors in an attempt to confuse international public opinion.

The reporter took the opportunity to discuss this with the spokesperson of the Military Affairs Commission, who stated that General Lin's meticulous planning in this Guinan campaign led to a major defeat for the Japanese. To demonstrate this, he showed a personally written letter from Lin dated the 12th, proving that the Japanese rumors were completely unfounded. (Dispatch from the 15th)

### 冀省游擊區　生活狀况

Living Conditions in the Guerrilla Areas of Hebei Province

Chongqing: The Secretary-General of the Hebei Provincial Kuomintang Department recently arrived here for a short trip and gave a first-hand account of the living conditions in a certain base area of the Chinese army's guerrilla forces in the Taihang Mountains of Hebei Province. It is said that General Lu Zhonglin, Chairman of Hebei Province, has now established his command headquarters in the Taihang Mountains. Life in the mountains is not as difficult as expected. Beer and cigarettes are not considered luxuries in the guerrilla areas. Chinese merchants are able to transport salt and food into the guerrilla areas despite the Japanese "economic blockade." A regular newspaper is now published in the mountains and circulated everywhere. This is no easy feat. The Chinese commanders understood the need to publish a newspaper in the area and began preparations. The biggest difficulty was the lack of a printing press. Finally, an agreement was reached with a commander of the puppet army in the area. The puppet army commander purchased a new printing press in Tianjin and transported it via the Pinghan Railway to the station closest to the Taihang Mountains, and then the guerrilla forces transported it into the mountains. The guerrilla forces and the puppet army maintain close contact. A representative of the guerrilla forces met with a puppet commander to persuade him to defect and join the guerrilla forces. The puppet commander replied that he could provide better service by staying with the Japanese, as his troops' food, clothing, weapons, and pay were provided by the Japanese. He could supply the guerrilla forces with the salt, food, and other materials they urgently needed. If the Japanese planned to attack, he could notify the guerrilla forces in advance. If the Japanese forced the puppet army to participate in combat, the puppet army could fire into the air and then retreat, abandoning weapons and ammunition to the guerrilla forces. Today, outside the cities and towns of Hebei Province, there are county magistrates appointed by the central government, while inside the city walls there are puppet county magistrates appointed by the Japanese. However, the two county magistrates often maintain close contact. For example, when a certain county magistrate appointed by the government opened a workers' training class in the occupied area, the county magistrate appointed by the Japanese sent two trusted confidants to participate in the class. The Chinese guerrilla forces have repeatedly blown up the Pinghan Railway, averaging one explosive detonation per week. Initially, if a village failed to report the presence of guerrilla forces to the Japanese, the villagers would be massacred. At the same time, the guerrilla forces also retaliated against villagers who informed the Japanese. Therefore, the villagers along the railway were in a dilemma. Finally, the villagers reached an agreement with the guerrilla forces that after each attack on the railway, they must take the responsible village chief with them and release him afterward. The Japanese are now occupying Chinese-owned coal mines in Henan Province, producing 200 tons of coal per day. The Zhongfu Company coal mine, a joint Chinese-British venture, has been destroyed by the guerrilla forces, but the Japanese have repaired the machinery in one of the coal mines and resumed operations.

Editorial

### The Problem of Sheltering Beggars

Since China has suffered foreign aggression, the number of people who have been displaced and wandering is no less than millions. Shanghai, under the protection of the concessions, has been fortunate to remain relatively intact despite the widespread disasters. As a result, like water flowing into a gully, the masses regard Shanghai as their final refuge. On the one hand, this has created the current distorted prosperity, but on the other hand, we see vagrants lingering in the streets and crouching by the roadside, all of whom are struggling on the brink of starvation. This not only affects the appearance of the city, but also has a significant impact on public order. This newspaper has repeatedly addressed this issue. Previously, it was reported that the Public Works Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council had a plan to shelter beggars, but the department's funds were restricted by the resolution of the early taxpayers' annual meeting, which stipulated that the funds collected under the land charter regulations could not be used for relief purposes. Therefore, the funds needed for the beggar relief plan had to rely on private or public donations. Although the Salvation Army is in charge of the matter, it is suffering from a lack of funds. Therefore, it is hoped that the public will take their interests into consideration and find ways to raise funds. The Municipal Council's consideration of this matter will surely be sympathized with by all sectors of the city.

If the source of such funds relies solely on public donations, although it is a matter of necessity, it is likely difficult to sustain. Donations come from the willingness of various parties to help, so the results are difficult to predict. However, the expenses of the undertaking are constant year after year, and cannot rely on fluctuating income to cover fixed expenditures. Moreover, Shanghai's various sectors have long been working to shelter beggars and vagrants. For example, the Xiliu Public Shelter provides shelter from wind and rain and relief from hunger and cold. The Songhu Education and Rehabilitation Institute on Liuying Road in Zhabei is dedicated to the education and rehabilitation of vagrants and beggars. Both regularly received subsidies each year, but due to the large amount of money required and the difficulty of the task, they still had to rely on donations and eventually ceased operations halfway through. In Caohejing, there is the Vagrant Work Training Center run by the Shanghai Charity Association, which has better facilities and a regular source of funds, so it is progressing in an orderly manner and has achieved considerable success. Later, it was believed that vagrants and beggars wandering the streets could not be effectively sheltered without a large-scale plan. Therefore, it was proposed to establish a vagrant factory, but the amount of money required was enormous, and it was known that it could not be achieved by public donations alone. It was proposed to relocate a certain church cemetery on North Zhejiang Road and rebuild it as a market, using this large sum of income to support regular expenses. However, due to a dispute that occurred between the Tongzhi and Guangxu periods, when the Municipal Council planned to buy this cemetery as a site for a Chinese children's public school, it was opposed by the gentry, and it was returned to the Municipal Council, but it was stipulated that it could not be used for other purposes. Therefore, this plan returned to nothing. The problem of sheltering beggars has been full of twists and turns, rising and falling repeatedly. As of now, the problem has become increasingly serious, and a solution cannot be delayed. Therefore, the Municipal Council has had to take on the burden alone.

However, since sheltering beggars is in the public interest, it is appropriate to hold the public responsible for the burden. Although it is said to be restricted by its powers and cannot be listed as a regular expenditure of the Municipal Council, that is, it cannot be funded by taxes, sheltering beggars and vagrants should not be regarded as relief in nature. It directly aims to improve the appearance of the city and indirectly maintain public order. Therefore, the simplest method and the most reasonable remedy is for the Municipal Council to propose to the taxpayers' meeting to allocate special funds from the municipal budget as a fee for improving the appearance of the city. This cannot be regarded as exceeding its powers. If this is not feasible, the Municipal Council could be authorized to solicit a fixed-term vagrant donation from merchants and gentry within the concession who are able to bear the tax, limited to a certain number of years. After this period, depending on the amount of revenue generated by the undertaking itself, whether it can be self-sufficient, the donation amount could be reduced or discontinued. This would provide a more fixed income and ensure the progress of the undertaking.

If the above-mentioned proposals cannot be realized, then with the Salvation Army's enthusiasm and perseverance, it will surely achieve considerable success. However, it can only proceed within its means and provide shelter on a limited basis. To say that it will be able to fully shelter all beggars is ultimately reminiscent of the sigh, "Where can I get tens of millions of mansions?"

### 渝當局疏散人民　為預防日方之空襲　外使館不凖備遷移

Chongqing Authorities Evacuate People to Prevent Japanese Air Raids, Foreign Embassies Not Preparing to Relocate

Chongqing: In light of the fact that during the Japanese air raids on the capital in May of last year, Chongqing residents suffered 5,014 deaths and injuries from Japanese bombing within two days, the Chinese government authorities are currently implementing active measures to evacuate residents in order to avoid repeating this tragedy. The authorities intend to reduce the number of residents from 500,000 to 80,000. According to responsible authorities, the number of Chongqing residents will be reduced to 250,000 by the end of May. The government hopes to further reduce the number to 100,000 or 80,000. In November of last year, the population of Chongqing reached 600,000, but by the beginning of February of this year, it had been reduced to 550,000. In early March, the military and police authorities used persuasion and coercion to evacuate another 100,000 residents. The authorities now plan to evacuate another 200,000 residents within two weeks. If so, by the end of March, only 250,000 residents will remain in Chongqing. The seven foreign embassies stationed in Chongqing have notified the government that they do not intend to relocate their offices and residences. Four foreign ambassadors (British, American, French, and Soviet) are currently here. In addition, there are 40 foreign missionaries from all over the world staying in Chongqing, preparing to provide assistance and relief work in the event of a bombing of Chongqing. The Chongqing authorities have already allowed foreign missionaries to stay in the city. Currently, most of the housewives from middle-class families in Chongqing have evacuated from Chongqing, but their husbands remain in the city. Some wealthy families have moved to western Sichuan, while others have decided to move to Hanoi, Hong Kong, Manila, and other places. The "Dagongbao" recently reported that some Chinese missionaries have moved their families to the United States. Over the past twelve months, the authorities have built tunnel-style air raid shelters throughout the foothills of Chongqing, which can accommodate 250,000 residents. However, in order to reduce the death rate of residents during the summer air raids, only half of the people are allowed to stay in Chongqing. It is reported that all members of the National Relief Commission, as well as 2,000 police officers, and 1,000 doctors and nurses, are stationed in emergency hospitals and emergency stations, preparing to provide relief to injured residents in the event of a Japanese air raid on Chongqing. Since March 1st, all emergency teams, including many monks, have been engaged in rescue work at all times. The central points for residents evacuating from Chongqing are mostly the villages near Chongqing, which include six hot springs. When women and children evacuate to these places, it is like "going on a vacation." Small department stores, photography shops, grocery stores, and silk shops are set up near these villages to meet the needs of the residents. It is said that Chongqing's merchants and shop owners are in the vanguard of those voluntarily evacuating, because they are eager to open "branch stores" in the evacuation areas and avoid the sluggishness of the "abandoned capital." New theaters, singers, and teahouses are springing up like mushrooms after rain outside "Greater Chongqing." Imported goods can only be purchased in the villages, because no merchants want to keep valuable goods in the urban commercial area for fear of being bombed. Although the Chinese authorities have made various preparations to avoid Japanese air raids on Chongqing, foreign observers here believe that if Japanese planes attack Chongqing again this year, it will not be as fierce as last year. Last year's Japanese air raids achieved nothing in military terms. Japanese planes bombing Chongqing again will only waste expensive gasoline and bombs. (Associated Press dispatch from the 15th)

### 奇俊峯　謁蔣委員長　內蒙女英雄　抗戰著聲聞

Qi Junfeng Visits Chairman Chiang, Inner Mongolian Heroine Known for Resisting Japan

Chongqing: Ms. Qi Junfeng, an anti-Japanese hero from a certain banner in Inner Mongolia, arrived in Yulin, northern Shaanxi, yesterday to pay her respects to General Chiang Kai-shek here. Ms. Qi is the first female hero in Mongolian history to lead troops in the fight against Japan. Ms. Qi married a 41-year-old Mongolian prince at the age of twenty. After two years of marriage, she became a widow like Wenjun. Afterwards, she rejected many marriage proposals. She currently plans to choose a worthy partner. In 1937, Ms. Qi was captured by Japanese soldiers and imprisoned in her palace. A year later, she escaped and joined the Mongolian army supporting the National Government. Later, she became the commander of the Mongolian garrison, which was unprecedented in Mongolian history. (Associated Press dispatch from the 15th)

### 華利用駱駝　載運貨物

China Uses Camels to Transport Goods

Chongqing: Most experts here believe that after two and a half years of war, China's most reliable and economical method of transportation between the interior and the outside world is still the old method of hundreds of years ago. In view of the fact that the coast has been blockaded by the Japanese navy, railways and highways are often bombed, gasoline is difficult to obtain, and there are various problems related to railway maintenance and truck operation, the Chinese are now using camels in the northwest to transport goods to and from the Soviet Union, and using sailing ships to navigate inland waterways. The ancient roads of centuries ago, which had been abandoned after the construction of railways and highways, are now being traversed by horse-drawn carriages full of goods. The Chinese authorities have now reopened the ancient post roads of Yunnan and Guizhou, which were once used by merchants and travelers. Soon, horse-drawn carriages carrying goods will appear on these long-abandoned roads, importing the supplies needed by China and exporting Chinese products. (Reuters dispatch from the 15th)

### 美國人士觀察　日蘇衝突遲早難免　傳諾蒙亨附近又啓釁端　日軍部發言人聲明否認

American Observers Believe that Conflict Between Japan and the Soviet Union is Inevitable Sooner or Later, It is Reported that Hostilities Have Resumed Near Nomonghan, Spokesman for the Japanese Military Denies

Washington: According to observers here, after the end of the Soviet-Finnish War, the Soviet and Japanese armies will inevitably have intermittent conflicts again in the Manchurian border area. However, this conflict may not develop into a large-scale war, as the Soviet Union's position in the Balkans is not yet clear. However, if the Soviet Union's position in the Balkans becomes clear, it is not impossible that the Soviet Union will take an offensive against Japan. According to the Soviet side, the Soviet Union's attack on Finland this time was aimed at protecting Leningrad, but this reason also applies to the Far East. In other words, if the Soviet Union protects the safety of Vladivostok, it can also launch a full-scale offensive against the Manchurian border. As for future small conflicts, they can greatly restrain the Japanese army's actions in China. (Associated Press dispatch from the 15th)

### 傳天津白銀問題　英日商有成議　轉移須得中政府同意一點　據聞仍為東京談判之障礙

It is Reported that British and Japanese Merchants Have Reached an Agreement on the Tianjin Silver Issue, the Requirement of Obtaining the Chinese Government's Consent for Transfer is Still Reportedly an Obstacle to the Tokyo Negotiations

Tokyo: British Ambassador Sir Robert Craigie met with Japanese Foreign Minister Tani Masayuki for an hour this morning. According to the "Asahi Shimbun," the Tianjin silver issue was the subject of discussion, but the obstacle still lies in the British government's insistence on obtaining the Chinese government's consent for the transfer of silver. The "Yomiuri Shimbun" also reported that it is said that Craigie and Tani Masayuki will sign a memorandum at their next meeting, formally indicating a resolution to the silver issue. Regarding this matter, both sides reached a complete agreement on the following basis on the 4th of this month: (1) The silver currently in the cellar of the British Consulate in Tianjin will be sealed and not moved. (2) The safekeeping of the silver will be jointly managed by the British and Japanese. (3) If necessary, a committee organized by British, American, and Japanese people will decide on the allocation of this silver. (4) Part of the silver, worth 100,000 British pounds, will be given to the Japanese to purchase food from Australia and Canada to relieve refugees in North China. The newspaper also said that with the resolution of the silver issue, the Japanese will lift the blockade of the British Concession in Tianjin. According to Reuters, the British ambassador's meeting with Tani Masayuki today was to discuss minor matters and did not mention the silver issue, as there are still some differences of opinion between the two sides, and the Japanese newspapers are being overly optimistic. (Reuters dispatch from the 15th)

Tokyo: According to news from here today, the British and Japanese have in fact reached an agreement on the issue of Chinese silver in the British Concession in Tianjin. The joint method is that the silver will be jointly managed by the Japanese, and another 100,000 British pounds will be provided to relieve refugees in North China. The detailed content of the agreement will probably be announced by the Wang Jingwei organization or the new government. It is also said that after the silver issue in the British Concession is resolved, the Japanese will further control the Chinese silver in the French Concession.

Chongqing: According to political observers here today, Franco-Japanese relations are now trending towards deterioration. The Franco-Japanese commercial treaty that expired today is unlikely to be renewed. The reason for the Franco-Japanese estrangement is the bombing of French property in South China by Japanese aircraft, but such actions by the Japanese will continue to occur in the future.

### 張嘉森論　中蘇合作

Zhang Jiasen on Sino-Soviet Cooperation

Chongqing: Zhang Jiasen, leader of the Chinese National Socialist Party, published an article in the Dagongbao today, advocating close cooperation between China and the Soviet Union for the mutual benefit of both countries. China and the Soviet Union share a border of thousands of miles. Neither China nor the Soviet Union is capable of building a Maginot Line on such a long border. Not only are China and the Soviet Union incapable of undertaking such a great project, but the economic strength and scientific technology of the 20th century are also insufficient to accomplish this. Therefore, it is necessary for China and the Soviet Union to cooperate closely. Furthermore, a strong China is sufficient to prevent imperialists from uniting in an anti-Soviet movement. At the same time, a strong Soviet Union is sufficient to protect China's freedom and prevent it from being invaded by foreign forces. Therefore, the security and prosperity of Asia depend entirely on the cooperation between China and the Soviet Union. We hope that the conclusion of the Soviet-Finnish peace will further increase aid to China and support China's constitutional movement. (Associated Press dispatch from the 15th)

### Nanjing to Hold "Political Conference"

Peiping: According to Chinese sources, the "Central Political Conference" to be held in Nanjing is planning to establish a new regime. In addition to discussing the procedures for convening a "National Assembly," the following points will be proposed: (1) the establishment of the central government and the selection and number of personnel for the five Yuan and various ministries; (2) the power of the central government; (3) the date of implementing the constitution; (4) the outline of domestic and foreign policies; (5) the re-adjustment of foreign policy; (6) the promulgation of a declaration to all countries in the world. The conference site will be at the original site of the Examination Yuan in front of Jiming Temple. Currently, 400 workers are engaged in renovation. It is reported that the conference preparatory committee, for security reasons, has requested the assistance of the Japanese authorities in defense. The area around the site will be guarded by a special guard line, and no idlers will be allowed to pass. When the new regime is established, the Joint Committee will no longer be needed. Therefore, the committee has decided to hold a dissolution meeting after the end of the Nanjing Central Political Conference. Wang Kemin and others will be among the North China representatives attending the Central Political Conference. (Reuter, 15th)

### After the End of the War, Soviet and Finnish Troops Began to Retreat. The Hanko Peninsula Was Ceded Within a Week. It is Rumored that Kuusinen Will Be Appointed as Governor.

Helsinki: The Finnish delegation to the peace talks has returned here from Moscow via the capital of Sweden. All newspapers have published the contents of the peace treaty and the new boundary line between the two countries. The troops of both sides are scheduled to begin withdrawing from the 15th of this month and complete the withdrawal by the 25th. However, the Petsamo region in northern Finland will not be completely withdrawn until April 10. The Hanko Peninsula must be ceded to the Soviet Union before the 23rd of this month. A wireless telegram has been issued here prohibiting people from traveling to the ceded areas of the Soviet Union. All local residents, a total of 250,000 people, must move elsewhere. The Ministry of Military Affairs has also issued an order requisitioning all means of transportation to carry these people and their assets, but people are not allowed to transport them privately. According to Finland, among the cities to be ceded to the Soviet Union in the Karelian Isthmus, the most important are three: one is the port of Vyborg, with a population of 80,000; one is the city of Käkisalmi, with a population of 6,000; and one is the city of Antrea, with a population of 5,000. According to observers, 5,000 Red Army corpses were left on the north side of Lake Ladoga, and they are now submerged in ice and snow. Once the ice and snow melt, they will be exposed and rot, which is greatly detrimental to public health. In addition, the Karelian Isthmus has many Finnish industrial centers, the most important of which are the lumber and celluloid factories in Pikkarala. The port of Vyborg is an important port for Finland's timber exports. After it is ceded to the Soviet Union, Finland's timber will be exported only through the port of Kotka in the east. (Havas, 15th)

London: Last night, the Soviet broadcast from this radio station stated that the Soviet troops who entered Vyborg on Wednesday held a celebration meeting for "Peace and Victory." The broadcast stated that the Finnish army "is now quiet and peaceful." In addition, the Soviet army held other gatherings. The speeches at the meeting expressed condolences for the Soviet government's "obtaining the security of Leningrad" and attacked "those in England and France who instigated the war." It said, "We have shattered their plans, and they now understand the consequences if they dare to try again." (Associated Press, 15th)

Stockholm: According to news from northern Finland, the Soviet army has begun to withdraw. The Finnish army and volunteers stationed in the area are still defending their original positions awaiting orders. (Reuter, 15th)

Stockholm: The "Social Democratic Newspaper" here recently published a telegram from a reporter stationed in Helsinki, stating that after Finland ceded the Karelian Isthmus to the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union will appoint Otto Wille Kuusinen, chairman of the "Finnish People's Government," as the governor to rule it. Kuusinen is the leader of the Finnish Communist Party and has been in exile in the Soviet Union for many years. After the outbreak of the Finnish-Soviet war last year, he organized the so-called "People's Government" under the auspices of the Soviet Union. (Havas, 15th)

### Finland, Norway and Sweden Initially Discussed a Three-Nation Defense Alliance, Intended to Protect the Borders and Independence of the Three Countries. Finland Expressed Its Unwillingness to Be Suspected of Being Anti-Soviet.

Helsinki: Last night, it was announced here that the governments of Finland, Sweden, and Norway have now agreed to study the nature of the possibility of a three-nation defense alliance in order to protect the borders and independence of the three countries. (Reuter, 15th)

Moscow: People here believe that the Soviet government does not oppose the conclusion of a purely defensive alliance between Sweden, Norway, and Finland, but any group action specifically against the Soviet Union will be regarded by the Soviet Union as a violation of the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty. (Reuter, 15th)

Helsinki: Speaker of the House Väinö Hakkila recently delivered a speech, which in essence stated, "Any action that is suspected of being against the Soviet Union is in conflict with the peace treaty between Finland and the Soviet Union." Observers, upon hearing this, generally stated that at a time when Finland is planning to conclude a defense alliance treaty with Sweden and Norway, this speech is particularly noteworthy.

Stockholm: Swedish Foreign Minister Sandler met with reporters yesterday and said that a few days before the Soviet-Finnish peace talks, the Finnish government sent a telegram to the governments of Norway and Sweden, proposing to conclude a three-nation defense alliance. Upon receiving the replies from the two countries, they said that they would consider the possibility of this alliance after peace was restored. These negotiations are currently underway, and the rumor that it has already been signed is an exaggeration. (Haitong, 15th)

Stockholm: The date of the three-nation conference of Sweden, Norway, and Finland on a defense alliance may be announced soon. It is expected that the conference site will not be held outside the capitals of the three countries, with Oslo being the most likely. At the same time, Norway and Sweden are currently focusing on the development of defense. It is reported that Sweden is now supplementing its delegation's purchase of fighter jets in the United States. (Reuter, 15th)

Stockholm: Although the governments of Norway and Sweden are still studying the defense alliance plan proposed by Finland, the defenses of Scandinavia are being accelerated in all aspects. Generally, people feel that one thing is currently more important than the Finnish territory bordering a dangerous situation, that is, whether Finland or Norway and Sweden will be forced to join the overall issue of the Soviet-German group is already in a precarious situation. At the same time, opinions on the need for a defense alliance also differ among the Scandinavian countries. According to Norwegian sources, Oslo believes that any defense agreement will not help the overall situation and will be rejected. Sweden is more welcome to this concept. According to today's Nya Dagligt Allehanda, it is crucial for Norway, Sweden, and Finland to conclude this alliance. The newspaper also expressed regret that Denmark, due to its lack of resources and close ties to Germany, could not apply to join this alliance. (Reuter, 15th)

Helsinki: Finland, Sweden, and Norway are currently conducting talks through diplomatic channels to discuss and agree on a defense alliance treaty and are determined to conclude it. Even the Soviet Union has issued a hint, stating that it does not conflict with the mutual non-aggression clauses in the Finnish-Soviet peace treaty. For this reason, those responsible here generally say that there should be no major obstacles to the future of the Northern European three-nation defense alliance treaty. (Havas, 15th)

### Finnish ceded area, residents evacuated

Stockholm: The evacuation of residents from the ceded areas of Finland is now being carried out according to the plan drawn up when the situation was serious last autumn. The residents of the same village will be gathered together first and then moved to another village. All railways will be mobilized for the evacuation, and those who hold driver's licenses will be summoned to assist in this work. (Reuter, 15th)

Helsinki: The majority of the residents of the Karelian Isthmus and some other places, which will be ceded to the Soviet Union, are farmers and landlords, 99% of whom will move elsewhere within a few days. According to the government's plan, the residents of the Karelian Isthmus must move to central Finland, and those living along Lake Ladoga will move to the coastal area of Åbo in western Finland. The authorities in various parts of central Finland have already begun to requisition means of transportation, trucks, and cars to carry these people and their assets. In addition, this city has been bombed by Soviet planes many times since the start of the war, and the scene is desolate, but from today onwards, the black cloth hanging on the windows of each house has been removed, and the obstacles in each store have also been removed. (Havas, 15th)

Helsinki: Helsinki canceled the blackout last night, restoring normality for the first time in three and a half months. The lights were bright and the people were happy. Although it snowed heavily during the day, there were still many people walking on the streets at night. Except for the piles of sandbags, everything in Helsinki can be said to have returned to normal. (Haitong, 15th)

### The entire Soviet Union celebrates victory

Moscow: After the peace between Finland and the Soviet Union, the radio station here recently issued a message stating that the entire Soviet Union is celebrating the "victory of the Red Army." Factories and public places are also holding gatherings to celebrate the "Red Army's breakthrough of the Mannerheim Line" and that the Soviet government's "peace policy" has finally eliminated the railway line between Leningrad and Murmansk, gaining security. This policy, which wanted to establish anti-Soviet military bases within Finland, has failed. In short, "Peace has now triumphed, and the rights of small countries have also been secured." (Havas, 14th)

### Norwegian Foreign Minister's statement on maintaining neutrality explains the reasons for rejecting Britain and France's passage.

Oslo: Foreign Minister Koht delivered a broadcast speech at 9:30 tonight, stating that we were deeply saddened upon hearing the contents of the peace treaty between Finland and the Soviet Union. The reason is that our country and Sweden aided Finland and sent volunteers to help in the war, ahead of other countries. "Finland's long-term resistance was a real situation, but it was not easy to fight hard until now. Last month, the Finnish government asked Sweden for help, but did not make the same request to our country. Our immediate priority is to maintain neutrality and stay out of the war, because if our country participates in the Finnish-Soviet war, there is a risk of being drawn into the whirlpool of the Western European war, which is terrible. Moreover, even if our troops went to Finland to help in the war, it might not be able to turn the tide. Even with regard to the request made by Britain and France on the 2nd of this month for "our country to allow the regular troops of each country to pass through," we waited for Sweden's reply before giving a negative reply on the 4th of this month for reference. In our opinion, "If you want to help Finland, you must have 100,000 troops, but if Britain and France send troops to help, Germany will also send troops to intervene." After weighing the pros and cons, we had to reject it. Some parties have repeatedly criticized our country for failing to be completely neutral. "For example, in the case of the German ship "Altmark," Britain and France accused our country of violating neutrality, while Germany did not criticize it, which shows that it is really difficult for us to be comprehensive. As for the rumor that Germany has built submarine bases on our coast and that our country has secretly supplied Germany with various goods, these are not true. If this statement were true, it would prove that the effective blockade policy of Britain and France is completely ineffective. In the past six months, our country's iron ore exports to Germany have been only 640,000 tons, which is a significant decrease compared to the 2,250,000 tons in the six months before the war. In short, "Our country will do everything possible to defend its neutrality and peace. In this period of peace, our country is also willing to help Finland engage in reconstruction work." (Havas, 14th)

### Finland once asked Britain and France to send troops to help in the war. British, French and Polish troops were ready to be dispatched.

London: A Reuter's parliamentary correspondent learned that Finland initially requested assistance from the Allies for war equipment rather than manpower. The Allies tried their best to transport war equipment to Finland as far as possible. Before long, Finland made an informal request for 50,000 soldiers to help in the war in May. The difficulty for the Allies to fulfill this request was that Sweden and Norway did not allow troops to pass through their territory. Although the Allies were still making preparations, they were ready to send the troops to Finland immediately upon receiving Finland's appeal. According to Reuter's information, if the expeditionary force were to depart, it would have full equipment, including an air force squadron. (Reuter, 13th)

London: Britain and France supplied Finland with a large amount of munitions, part of which had already been transported to the Scandinavian Peninsula when the Soviet Union and Finland signed a peace treaty. Britain and France will now transport it back. Although the governments concerned have provided political facilitation in this regard, the procedures are still extremely complicated and will not be completed until a few days later. (Havas, 15th)

Paris: The Polish News Agency here recently announced that the Polish Expeditionary Force, including naval, land, and air forces, was fully prepared and waiting in France to join the British and French forces to go to Finland. (Reuter, 15th)

### The peace treaty passed the second reading in the Finnish Parliament and may be approved within a few days.

Helsinki: Finnish Foreign Minister Tanner told reporters here yesterday that the Finnish Parliament may approve the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty within a few days. Before the treaty is approved, the conditions will be "discussed in detail." After the treaty is approved, Finland will send a new delegation to Moscow to exchange ratification documents. According to reliable sources, the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty has already passed the first and second readings. (Associated Press, 15th)

### Soviet Armistice Promotes Soviet-Italian Relations Soviet-Italian Trade Agreement Negotiations

Berlin: According to German reports, the end of the Soviet-Finnish war is sufficient to promote the rapprochement between the Soviet Union and Italy. The two countries will restore diplomatic relations and establish a commercial treaty. In addition, the commercial talks between Berlin and Rome and Moscow and Rome will improve Germany's difficulties after being blockaded by Britain. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's recent trip to Rome was to discuss this matter. After the German Foreign Minister returned to Berlin from Rome, he went straight to see Hitler. Officials denied rumors that Germany, the Soviet Union, and Romania would establish a three-nation non-aggression treaty. Romanian sources here also said that this matter has no basis. (Associated Press, 15th)

Rome: Foreign countries are paying close attention to the development of Soviet-Italian relations, but Italian newspapers do not mention the Italian official attitude. Agence France-Presse anticipates that the Italian ambassador to the Soviet Union will return to his post in Moscow, and Soviet-Italian commercial negotiations will also begin. However, well-informed sources believe that the recall of the Italian ambassador to the Soviet Union was due to the Soviet ambassador to Italy returning to Moscow without presenting his credentials. Therefore, the return of the Soviet ambassador depends on the return of the Soviet ambassador and the presentation of credentials to the Italian head of state. (Haitong, 16th)

### It is rumored that the Soviet Union and Romania are conducting negotiations

London: New York Radio relayed a message from Berlin stating that Germany had obtained a guarantee from the Soviet Union that no matter what happens in Southern Europe, it would never invade Romania. Negotiations on a Soviet-Romanian treaty are currently underway. A Romanian general is now in Berlin. Although it is rumored that his visit to Berlin is only for technical talks, this trip is of great significance. Berlin also stated that the negotiations between the Soviet Union and Romania will change the international situation before the end of this week. According to Reuter's investigation, well-informed sources in London have not obtained information confirming the above news. (Reuter, 15th)

London: According to Berlin news, the Soviet Union and Romania will re-sign a non-aggression treaty (the Soviet Union previously signed a multilateral non-aggression pact with a certain country on July 3, 1933, which also included Romania). British officials and Romanian officials have not confirmed this statement. Romanian sources in London said that a decision on this matter must first be made after consulting other countries in the Balkan Pact, especially Turkey. (Havas, 15th)

### After the Soviet-Finnish armistice, the European situation as observed by Norwegian newspapers

Oslo: The Norwegian semi-official newspaper "Aftenposten" published an article yesterday commenting on the impact of the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty on the overall European situation, stating that after the restoration of peace between the Soviet Union and Finland, Germany and Finland will definitely adjust their relations through the mediation of Soviet Russia, which will also have a significant impact on Sweden. In recent months, Sweden and Germany have had proposals and preparations for establishing good relations, and this tendency may become a reality due to the armistice in Northern Europe. The newspaper continued that Italy will definitely try its best to strengthen relations with Germany and the Soviet Union in the future, and Turkey will inevitably be divided on Britain and France. As a result, the European situation will change greatly, and the position of Britain and France will inevitably become unfavorable. (Haitong, 15th)

### French Senate discusses the Finnish question

Paris: The Senate held a closed meeting this afternoon. Many senators successively raised questions about the government's policies on the Finnish question. Former Prime Minister Laval also raised questions about wartime foreign policy. The Senate will continue to meet tomorrow afternoon to listen to the report of Prime Minister Daladier and then vote. (Havas, 14th)

### The Sixth Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union will open on the 29th

Moscow: The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union recently decided to convene the Sixth Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union in Moscow on the 29th of this month. (Tass, 15th)

### United States expands air force budget

Rome: Air Force Colonel Valle declared today during the Fascist Trade Union Council's debate on the air force budget that the current production rate of Italian military aircraft is higher than at any time in the past, and will almost double in the next few months. Colonel Valle continued that the German Air Force has clearly demonstrated its superiority over British merchant shipping in the North Sea. As for dealing with warships, although it cannot have any effect, it can at least limit its use and activities. This situation is particularly important in Italy, because the Mediterranean is our channel and life, and we must rely on airplanes to maintain its opening. Mussolini was also present at the meeting at the time, and then, in his capacity as Minister of the Army, proposed a bill stipulating that the maximum amount of increased defense expenditure up to June 30 of this year is 8 billion lire (approximately £108,000,000). (Reuter, 15th)

### The Dutch Ambassador to China will be replaced

The Hague: After the Dutch Ambassador to China, F.C.A. den Beer Poortugael, returned to his country, he has not yet returned to his post. Political sources recently stated that the government will promote Count Bylandt, Chargé d'Affaires in Egypt, to the post of Dutch Ambassador to China. (Havas, 15th)

### Polish Government Publishes Diplomatic Documents, Recounts the Evolution of German-Polish Relations, Exposes Germany's Repeated Acts of Bad Faith

Paris – The Polish government today released a white paper, including 184 diplomatic documents, to explain "the reasons for the country's resistance to aggression and its determination to continue the war." The Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Grarinski, also gave a statement to the press. The documents contained in this white paper are not limited to the relationship between Poland and Germany but also involve the relationship between Poland and the Soviet Union, covering the period from 1933 to 1939. It is divided into two parts:

(A) Part One: The evolution of diplomatic relations between Germany and Poland, the main points of which are as follows:

(1) On May 2, 1933, the Polish Ambassador to Germany, Mr. Wysocki, held talks with the German leader Hitler to discuss promoting bilateral relations. This was the starting point of Poland's efforts to improve relations with Germany and avoid the use of force to resolve bilateral issues. The two sides then concluded a non-aggression pact on January 26, 1934, to reaffirm friendship. (2) Germany repeatedly proposed a joint attack on the Soviet Union with Poland. The first time was on February 10, 1935, when the German Minister of Aviation, General Göring, proposed this to the late Polish Minister of Military Affairs, General Piłsudski. The second time was on August 14, 1936, when the current German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop delivered a speech, emphasizing that the crisis posed by the Soviet Union was an important factor in promoting German-Polish relations. However, the Polish government never agreed to this proposal. It can be seen that the reason why Germany's plan to attack the Soviet Union failed to materialize was due to Poland's opposition. (3) From 1923 to 1938, the German authorities constantly declared their respect for the existing Polish territory. The German Minister of Aviation, General Göring, even declared on February 16, 1937, "The Polish Corridor is not a must-have for our country. I hereby solemnly declare that we have no intention of taking the Corridor." Even the German leader Hitler also issued a declaration on May 2, 1933, stating that "Germany recognizes that all current treaties are binding." As for Poland, it never attempted to expand its rights in the Free City of Danzig. Hitler himself admitted this during a conversation with the Polish ambassador on November 5, 1937. (4) Since 1938, Germany's ambitions towards Poland have gradually been exposed. The German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop held talks with the Polish Ambassador Lipski on October 24, 1938, strongly stating that Germany wanted to incorporate the Free City of Danzig into its territory and build a highway through the Polish Corridor. This was the first. Hitler confirmed this request again when he received the Polish Foreign Minister, Colonel Beck, on January 5, 1939. This was the second. In March of the same year, Germany occupied the Czech provinces of Moravia and Bohemia, and its propaganda machine vigorously carried out anti-Polish movements. This was the third. In response, the Polish Foreign Minister, Colonel Beck, ordered the Polish Ambassador to Germany, Lipski, on October 31, 1938, to inform the German authorities that any action attempting to incorporate the Free City of Danzig into German territory could lead to conflict. However, the Polish government was still prepared to discuss this specific proposal, especially the proposal concerning transportation between Germany's East Prussia and mainland Germany. However, the German government has not yet put forward a counter-proposal. The Polish government was forced to sign a mutual guarantee agreement with the United Kingdom on April 6, 1939, and reaffirmed the alliance treaty between Poland and France on April 13 of the same month. (5) In the five months from April to August 1939, Germany consistently avoided negotiations with the Polish government. Towards the end of August, the Danzig Free City Council arbitrarily changed its constitution, and the leader of the Nazi Party in the city, Forster, arbitrarily declared himself the leader of Danzig. Until the evening of August 31, German radio suddenly broadcast the so-called final demands, but in reality, these demands were not formally presented. Thus, without waiting for the Polish government to discuss them, the war had already broken out. Whose responsibility this is, is very clear.

(B) Part Two: Includes the international treaties on which the diplomatic relations between Poland and the Soviet Union were based, and explains their evolution as follows:

(1) After Germany and Poland concluded a non-aggression pact on January 26, 1934, the Polish Foreign Minister, Colonel Beck, went to Moscow for an official visit. In addition to issuing formal speeches reaffirming friendship, the authorities of the two countries also signed a protocol to extend the period of validity of the non-aggression treaty between Poland and the Soviet Union. (2) The Polish government has refused any proposal to join the anti-Comintern pact. The Soviet government, on the other hand, had always been hostile to Germany before September 1939. The Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, Mr. Potemkin, declared in Warsaw last May that "If an armed conflict occurs between Germany and Poland, the Soviet Union will adopt a benevolent neutral attitude towards Poland," which is clear evidence. Unexpectedly, a few months later, the country's policy suddenly changed, and the Red Army troops finally entered Polish territory on September 19 of last year, it is said. (Havas dispatch, 14th)

### Anniversary of the Fall of Czechoslovakia: British Foreign Secretary Encourages Czechs, Resolves to Help Czechs Fight for National Restoration

London – Tonight is the eve of the first anniversary of the German invasion of Czechoslovakia. Foreign Secretary Halifax wrote an article to encourage the Czechs not to be discouraged. The original article was written in Czech and broadcast by radio. The content roughly stated that Hitler originally provided assurances that he would respect the integrity of Czechoslovakia, but he went back on his word and brazenly turned Czechoslovakia into a protectorate, sending troops to station in Prague. "The promises he and the German government made have been rendered untrustworthy due to this violent and perfidious behavior. The horrific actions taken by the country afterward were even more brutal, such as the forced closure of Czech schools and the arrest of intellectual leaders, which have aroused the indignation of the world. Germany's intention is to destroy the Czech people's economic and spiritual life in one fell swoop. Fortunately, the Czech people, though in distress, are still united and determined to fight for freedom with great courage. Germany's attempt has ultimately failed. The British people, while admiring the Czech people, express their sympathy. Now, the government and people of the British Empire have joined forces with the Allied countries to fight shoulder to shoulder, determined to restore freedom to the Czech people and relieve their suffering, to correct the unjust situation and transform Europe, so that such crimes will never be repeated. This is the supreme goal for which we are fighting, and we wish to encourage the Czech people together," it is said. (Havas dispatch, 14th)

Berlin – German leader Hitler telegraphed a reply to Neurath, Protector of Poland, stating, "I deeply appreciate your telegram of congratulations on the anniversary of the establishment of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. The two regions of Bohemia and Moravia have belonged to the German Empire for a thousand years. The Germans and Czechs in the new Germany will be able to trust each other and cooperate permanently." (Haitong dispatch, 15th)

### Germany Arrests More People in the Protectorate

Paris – According to reports from the Czech border, the authorities in Bohemia and Moravia have recently arrested a large number of people again, similar to the situation before Germany invaded Poland. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)

### US Peace Envoy Welles Revisits Rome, British Authorities Explain Their Views, Europe Needs Security Guarantees

Paris – US Undersecretary of State Welles took a train from here to Rome at 8:29 this afternoon. Deputy Foreign Minister Turi, Italian Ambassador Gallageria, British Ambassador Campbell, and US Chargé d'Affaires Murray were at the station to see him off. As for President Roosevelt's personal letter, it has been presented to Premier Daladier by Undersecretary Welles in person. The content is kept strictly secret and will not be released. (Havas dispatch, 14th)

Rome – Informed sources claimed last night that US Undersecretary of State Welles' second visit to Rome is more important than the first. It is widely believed that Welles may meet with the Pope again before returning to the United States. (United Press dispatch, 15th)

London – Reuters has learned that US Undersecretary of State Welles had the following impressions when he left Britain yesterday: (1) Europe needs security guarantees, which is the main factor in the international situation. (2) Britain and France are determined to fight to the end to obtain this guarantee. (3) Britain and France are not prepared to allow economic or other issues to lead to a temporary peace. The Allies were also very impressed by Welles' clear attitude in expressing the United States' eternal concern for the current and future situation in Europe. They were also satisfied that Welles apparently grasped the true situation in each country. The Allies felt no fear in comparing their views with those of President Roosevelt, as presented by Welles. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)

### Soviet Izvestia Comments on the Significance of the Peace Treaty, Not Limited to Truce

Moscow – Regarding the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty, Izvestia commented, "The significance of this treaty is not limited to a truce. This treaty has destroyed the base of operations for anti-Soviet war (which was prepared by the enemies of the Soviet Union outside the city of Leningrad for decades). At the same time, this treaty has also strengthened the security of the entire Gulf of Finland coast and the Murmansk Railway (which is the artery of our north and Murmansk). The security was achieved through a reasonable and fair demarcation. Not only that, this treaty has also laid a solid foundation for various friendly relations between the two countries. The treaty stipulates that Soviet goods can be transported to Norway via Petsamo, and the Soviet Union and Finland will jointly build a new railway to develop Soviet and Swedish freight transportation. All of these have also laid a stable foundation for Soviet-Finnish economic cooperation and are in line with the treaty's purpose of restoring economic relations and starting negotiations on trade agreements. Whether in letter or spirit, the treaty does not destroy Finland's independence (which Finland gained from the Soviet Union 22 years ago). The Soviet Union did not want to see the outbreak of the Soviet-Finnish war. On the contrary, the Soviet Union has done its best to avoid war. However, the forces that launched the new imperialist war in Europe and attempted to expand the war incited Finland to fight against its friendly neighbors. In the atmosphere of the expanding European war, the Soviet Union continues its large-scale peace efforts. The proposals given by the Soviet Union to Finland in October 1939 were part of these efforts. At the same time, in view of the tense air, the Soviet Union is also striving to obtain security for its borders and establish friendly relations with its closest neighbors, because in the air containing poisonous substances, these neighbors are very likely to be used by imperialists. The good achievements of the Soviet Union's peace policy are well known. The agreements concluded by the Soviet Union with Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania are clear evidence. These agreements not only guarantee the permanent peace between the Soviet Union and the three countries, as well as the common security of the Soviet Union, Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania, but have also further developed the economic relations of the signatory countries. At the same time, the Soviet Union believes that it is more necessary to ensure the security of the Soviet-Finnish border. The city of Lenin is the second most important city in the Soviet Union and the birthplace of the October Revolution. It is within the range of enemy artillery fire, and its threat in the current international emergency is self-evident. In the Soviet-Finnish negotiations, the Soviet Union made concessions everywhere, but still there were [missing text] certain results. The peace treaty signed by the Soviet Union and Finland on March 12 has dealt a fatal blow to those who provoked the war in Northern Europe. The Red Army destroyed the Karelian Line (which was considered impregnable by British and French experts). The Soviet government's conspiracy against neutral countries, these countries have now been given peace, all threats to undermine their independence and force them to join the war have passed. This fact has been proven by the newspapers of Scandinavian and Baltic countries. The Soviet-Finnish peace treaty signed on March 12 is more important than the relationship between the signatory countries. The treaty is clear evidence of the success of the Soviet Union's peace policy. First, the treaty proves that the Soviet Union does not make demands that impede the dignity and independence of small countries, whether in diplomatic negotiations or after military victory. Second, the treaty proves that all small countries that rely on "guarantees" have become tools of others, and only by adopting an independent and wise policy can they avoid tragic consequences. Finally, the treaty shows that the Soviet Union's demands are reasonable, and can be realized in the shortest time even in adverse circumstances. The Soviet people expressed their welcome to this treaty, not only that, but also the true advocates of world peace must express their warm welcome." (TASS dispatch, 14th)

### US Moral Embargo Policy Towards the Soviet Union Remains Unchanged

Washington – Secretary of State Hull recently replied to inquiries while hosting reporters that although the Soviet Union and Finland have established a peace treaty, the US government's policy on "spiritual embargo measures" may not be changed as a result. Observers commented that President Roosevelt issued a statement yesterday condemning the Soviet Union's invasion of Finland, and US public opinion has already been encouraged. For this reason, the "spiritual embargo measures" will definitely be continued. (Havas dispatch, 14th)

### Zhu Jiahua on the European War: No Disadvantage to China (Continued) China's Diplomacy is Skillful and Bears an Important Mission for World Peace

3. Comparison of Strengths

Before we analyze the current economic situation of the belligerent countries, let's first examine the manpower of both sides. The combined population of the main players, Britain and France, is 84 million. Although the population of their territories can be mobilized, it is not the main source and does not need to be counted. This is less than the 170 million of Imperial Russia, the more than 40 million of Italy, and the 120 million of the United States in the last World War. On the German side, since annexing Austria and Czechoslovakia, excluding the Czechs, the population is 80 million. Compared with the last World War, the population of Bulgaria and Turkey has decreased. However, compared to the situation in the last war where almost the whole world was against Germany, Germany clearly has the advantage in manpower this time. As for how the comparison of manpower will be in the future when both belligerent parties are striving to develop their countries, it is difficult to say at this moment.

Such is the manpower situation. In terms of material resources, Britain and France have an absolute advantage. Since its defeat in the last war, Germany's cash foreign exchange and overseas investments have plummeted compared to before the war. Although it has automatically lifted the restrictions of the Treaty of Versailles in recent years, the result of fulfilling the treaty for ten years after the war, and the unlimited expansion of the military for the past five years, has left it with exhausted resources. Compared to the wealth it possessed in 1914, which no one could have foreseen, the feeling of comparing the past and the present is overwhelming. Simply put, before September of last year, the living conditions of the German people were already in a wartime state. Statistics also tell us that Britain cannot be self-sufficient in too many materials. For example, in terms of food, despite continuous efforts in agriculture and the success of the Four-Year Plan after the war, it can only achieve 85% self-sufficiency. In addition, it needs to import miscellaneous grains from Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Romania, and other countries. There is a particular shortage of fats. Including all of Austria and Czechoslovakia, the output is only 3 million tons, which is not enough and needs to be supplied by Romania and the Soviet Union. Although military industries have some copper, iron sand, etc. produced, they are insufficient and must be purchased from Yugoslavia or obtained from Sweden. Raw materials for the textile industry must be imported wool from South Africa and Australia, and cotton from the United States, Brazil, Egypt, and India. These items, on which the people's daily lives depend and which are needed for the supply of the army during wartime, can still be obtained from neutral neighboring countries, but most sources will be affected by the blockade of the superior navies of Britain and France, leading to a complete cut-off of supplies.

It goes without saying that Britain and France have abundant material resources. The same is true in terms of financial resources. Comparing Germany's possessions with those of Britain and France, the difference is too great. The combined gold reserves and foreign investments of Britain and France are 1,418 million, while Germany has only 130 million. The average annual income per person is only 62 pounds in Germany, which further illustrates that the contribution of each Briton to the country in terms of financial resources is many times greater than that of each German.

4. German-Soviet Relations

Given the economic disparity between Germany and Britain and France, why is Germany confident in supporting this war? Is it a blitzkrieg? It seems that Hitler does not have this delusion. Because of this, on the eve of the war, he suddenly changed his plan and reconciled with the Soviet Union, an enemy in politics and ideology, establishing a non-aggression pact and a trade agreement. Knowing that a blitzkrieg was not allowed by objective facts, he had to accept foreign aid, especially hoping that the Soviet Union would provide economic assistance. Bismarck once stated in his book "Thoughts and Memories" the danger of Germany fighting on both the east and west fronts at the same time. Wilhelm II originally adhered to this advice and made enemies with Imperial Russia, resulting in failure. Hitler, in view of this, made a sudden change. Passively, he could avoid worrying about the east, and actively, he could obtain economic assistance. This cannot be regarded as unwise and is hated by the Allied countries. However, to what extent and with what limitations can the Soviet Union provide economic support to Germany?

The Soviet Union's assistance to Germany is first hindered by psychological factors. Although Germany and the Soviet Union are currently mutually beneficial and complementary, it cannot be denied that the Soviet Union does not want to see Germany rashly gain a leading position in Europe. Therefore, the rumors of a military alliance between Germany and the Soviet Union are just air and propaganda, and at least at this stage, there is no possibility of realization. Based on this inference, political reasons will inevitably affect the components of political connectivity. Moreover, although the Soviet Union's production volume in recent years has increased fourfold compared to the past, due to the improvement of the living standards of its own people and the increase in needs, the surplus that can be exported is not large. Although Germany is good at using its credit loans to increase trade with the Soviet Union, and thereby hopes to seize control of Soviet trade (the commercial agreement established on August 19, 1939, was based on this), and although the 200 million mark loan to the Soviet Union in 1926, the so-called Piatakov Agreement in 1932, and the subsequent 200 million mark loan in 1935, increased Germany's import trade with the Soviet Union to 47%, which is 24% of Germany's total exports, and although Hitler once proudly said about this that what could be done before can be done now and can be continuously increased, however, the Soviet Union's exports to Germany are aimed at exchanging for Germany's industrial products, which are urgently needed by Germany itself during wartime, and there is no large surplus. The burden on German industry has already become heavy, and it has reached a point where it cannot reciprocate as scheduled. Therefore, the future of the barter trade policy is not optimistic on the German-Soviet side. To rashly talk about cash transactions... (To be continued)

### Guidance for Middle School Students (2)

— Wang Maozu

(3) "Vigilance and Reflection": In the past, the general leaders of young people in society, in order to awaken the masses, certainly had to be very passionate and fully stimulating in order to achieve rapid results. However, the methods they adopted resulted in many malpractices, leading to the development of habits of vanity and impatience, and the loss of a calm and persevering moral character. They only allowed emotions to run wild, and the so-called "moving the mind and enduring the nature" could no longer be seen. Moreover, after excessive excitement, young people easily tend to become decadent after setbacks. Now, having received unprecedentedly difficult lessons, they know that the War of Resistance and national construction cannot be achieved by empty shouts and emotional clamor. Therefore, those responsible for guidance should also be aware that on the one hand, they must constantly remind students of the national crisis and survival, and on the other hand, they must make students reflect on the historical causes and consequences and their own responsibilities at all times, and cultivate a calm and persevering spirit. This kind of character is most needed in the process of the War of Resistance and national construction.

(4) "Physical Training and Temperance": Physical training inherently contains mental training. Generally, people with strong physiques are able to endure hardship and can control impulses and overcome difficulties. Those who are weak are certainly unable to endure hardship, but it is now proven that even those who are strong are not necessarily able to endure hardship, and are not necessarily able to restrain their desires. The weak are just the opposite. The reason for this is that physical education in the past only pursued novelty, and was limited to trophy-style training in cities. Moreover, the general physical education teachers were really too poor in cultivating life sciences. This is the separation of mental training from physical fitness. Hard work is a habit. General physical exercises mostly focus on cultivating skills, which is unrelated to this habit. Now, we must focus on cultivating the habit of enduring hardship from the perspective of physical education, and cultivating the temperance of desires from the perspective of hygiene. However, the training methods must still refer to the individual's health status, and gradually advance from reluctant to natural.

(5) "Punishment and Sanctions": Punishment is essentially a negative method. It must be used properly so that students understand the reasons for being punished and consciously repent. Students are more afraid of criticism from their classmates than being recorded for demerits by the school. Therefore, the criticism of public opinion among classmates can be used as a method of sanction. However, young people's emotions are often biased and irrational. Therefore, in order to utilize peer sanctions, students must be taught to have a correct judgment of right and wrong.

4. Guiding Principles for Life Guidance

Life guidance is originally very cumbersome. This article only explains some principles, which are divided into two main outlines as follows:

(A) General Life Guidance

President Chiang Kai-shek has said that the New Life Movement is the life of the modern citizen, that is, the life of wartime. The six principles of the New Life Movement—orderliness, cleanliness, simplicity, frugality, promptness, and certainty—are all essential elements and standards of military life. The foundation of all education lies in teaching the general public to practice the New Life Movement. He also said, "If the living habits of ordinary young students cannot be improved, all education will fail." How alarming and earnest are these words! It can be seen that there is no so-called knowing except according to the outline of the New Life Movement. At present, middle schools have not yet been able to fully and earnestly implement these six standards. In fact, these six standards are only basic exercises. What is more important is to deeply cultivate the concepts of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, and then the character of the students can be strengthened. Therefore, at the Third National Education Conference, President Chiang Kai-shek personally proposed propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame as the unified school motto for the whole country, and explained that "propriety" teaches the people to help each other, cooperate, abide by discipline, and maintain order; "righteousness" teaches the people to be chivalrous, brave, responsible, and willing to sacrifice; "integrity" teaches the people to be thrifty, hardworking, separate public and private interests, and understand their duties; and "shame" teaches the people to be self-reliant, able to strive, and know how to progress. Of course, propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame cannot be achieved by perfunctory spiritual speeches. They must be guided and inspired from pointing out daily life and participating in group activities, using the various methods mentioned above. For example, to teach students to "be responsible," they must be made to do a part of things in group life in order to have a sense of responsibility. To teach "integrity," it is best to start with cherishing public property. To understand "shame," of course, start from unfavorable actions and areas where they are inferior to others to stimulate their sense of shame. As for the teaching of "propriety," schools now only teach students to be "polite" and "maintain order," which is only an external appearance. In fact, the essence of propriety is a norm of the human heart, and one must distinguish on one's own initiative in terms of motivation. Not only is it necessary to strengthen the external response of students, but also to train internal reflection. Few educators today understand this meaning.

### Xie Shuying, Inspector of the Ministry of Education, Dismissed

(Chongqing, 15th) The National Government issued an order on the 15th stating that Xie Shuying, Inspector of the Ministry of Education, will be assigned to another position. Xie Shuying should be relieved of his current position. This order.

### Zhang Shousong Goes to Chongqing

Zhang Shousong, the former inspector of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau in this city, took up teaching positions at the private Lehua Middle School and Yi Girls' Middle School after the war. Last August, he engaged in voluntary education inspection and guidance, exerting utmost effort, and was deeply appreciated by the education administrative supervisors. He was determined to be loyal and strictly abide by his post. Now, because there is a great need for talent in the rear, he has left Shanghai for Chongqing. While in Hong Kong, he specifically published an advertisement in Shanghai newspapers expressing his future obedience to President Chiang Kai-shek, support for the War of Resistance and national construction policies, and his determination to fight to the end.

The factory was notified of this decision in September 1939 and January 1940 respectively. Excerpts are as follows:

(1) Domestic Goods Certificate No. 144 states that "Jiu Wei Yi" standard monosodium glutamate is indeed a domestic product, and this certificate is issued as proof. Domestic Goods Certificate No. 145 states that "Xian Da Wang" mechanized monosodium glutamate is indeed a domestic product, and this certificate is issued as proof.

(2) Tax Exemption Notice No. 51160 states that since the quality of the samples of "Jiu Wei Yi" and "Xian Da Wang" monosodium glutamate produced by the Shanghai Standard Mechanized Monosodium Glutamate Factory are still usable, they should be approved for handling in accordance with the current methods of the Foreign-Style Goods Tax Law. The factory should be instructed to submit two copies of the inspected samples and trademarks to the Tax Bureau nearby for storage and transfer for future reference, etc. You should immediately comply and are hereby notified.

### City Residents Oppose Tax Increases; Municipal Council Reduces Budget

### By Over Two Million Dollars Compared to Draft; Justifications Offered for Increased Expenditures

The Shanghai Municipal Council for the Public Concession, due to budgetary deficits, proposed increasing various taxes and duties, which citizens have objected to. These situations have been repeatedly reported. Now, the Municipal Council has released a draft budget that has been significantly reduced, which is worthy of study. The original text is as follows:

Justification for Increased Expenditures

The draft budget for various departments of the Municipal Council for this year has been examined and significantly reduced. All reductions have been reported by the Treasurer to the Finance Committee. Now, a summary is provided for the reference of all taxpayers. Taxpayers who criticize the Council's excessive spending should pay attention to the following two points: (1) If the exchange rate does not fall below eight pence, the Council's income can often offset regular expenses. (2) Which of the Council's expenses should be reduced? The Council welcomes all constructive suggestions. The Council members are elected by taxpayers, and their task is to maintain public safety, order, and sanitation effectively and economically. What kind of comfortable environment taxpayers need and how much they are willing to pay should be decided by the taxpayers themselves. The Council's expenses are affected by the depreciation of the national currency, not just salaries. It has been clearly stated that the draft budget for various departments of the Council had already been reduced by more than two million dollars before being submitted to the Finance Committee. However, due to the recent high prices of food, the Council's budget had to be increased by more than one and a half million dollars again. For example, the cost of food for prisoners in prisons should be increased by 600,000 dollars from the original budget to cope with the situation. (Food for prisoners is borne by the state in all countries, not by municipal authorities.) Recently, rice subsidies have begun to be paid to low-ranking Chinese staff, which is estimated to cost around 900,000 dollars this year, and this was not included in the original budget.

Detailed Numbers of Budget Reductions

When the various departments of the Council were preparing their budgets, they were instructed to reduce them as much as possible while maintaining good administrative efficiency and striving for economy. Therefore, the draft budget was heavily cut by the Treasurer in conjunction with the heads of various departments. The relevant committees made significant contributions to this matter, which was very helpful. As a result, more than two million dollars were reduced in total. The breakdown is as follows:

Volunteer Corps: The original budget for the Volunteer Corps was $1,264,376. After revision, it was changed to $1,242,720, an increase of $358,120 over the previous year.

Fire Department: The draft budget for the Fire Department was $1,550,867. After revision, it was reduced to $1,515,730, an increase of $351,000 over the previous year.

Police Department: The draft budget for the Police Department was $15,915,270, of which prison maintenance costs accounted for $2,800,000. Now, due to rising food prices for prisoners, it is necessary to increase it by $600,000. At the same time, the amount of subsidies for foreign prisoners held in custody will be increased, and the First Special District Court will be asked to adjust the salaries of the Council's staff stationed in the hospital. The above budget has been revised again, and the result is $16,402,900, an increase of $4,490,780 over the previous year.

Health Department: The draft budget was $2,782,250. After revision, it was changed to $2,423,260, an increase of $534,610 over the previous year. According to the Treasurer, the reason for the reduction of the above budget is mostly due to the proposed increase in fees. However, if the number of applications from citizens is greatly reduced due to the increase in fees, the desired good results will not be obtained. In addition, if there is an epidemic this year, the Director of Health may submit a supplementary budget to cope with it.

Public Works Department: The draft budget was $6,452,900. After revision, it was reduced to $5,087,270, an increase of $868,220 over the previous year.

Municipal Orchestra: The draft budget was $236,220, which exceeded the prescribed amount by $236,220. The Music Committee suggested using all of the orchestra's reserves and increasing the fees for performances and rehearsals to make up for the shortfall. Therefore, the orchestra's budget for this year has been revised to the fixed amount of $200,000.

Finance Department: The budget was $1,528,260, an increase of $238,540 over the previous year.

Revenue Department: The draft budget was $745,039. After revision, it was reduced to $709,900, an increase of $162,810 over the previous year.

Legal Department: The draft budget was $220,212. After revision, it was reduced to $213,750, an increase of $35,640 over the previous year.

Chinese Department: The draft budget was $149,410. After adjustment, it was increased to $150,370, an increase of $37,180 over the previous year.

Possible Layoffs of Foreign Staff

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reported that there are rumors in the city that the Municipal Council may lay off several foreign staff members again, and it is expected that the most layoffs will be in the Public Works Department. However, the Council remains silent on this matter. The Municipal Council laid off staff three or four years ago, and now there are rumors of layoffs again, which has caused great indignation in some quarters. Others have mixed feelings. According to a Municipal Council employee who may be laid off, he is not worried about being laid off. When the previous batch of employees were laid off, the conditions were very good. If the Council offers satisfactory severance terms, he would be happy to retire. As for how the Council will raise the severance pay, that is the Council's business and has nothing to do with him. Other employees expressed dissatisfaction, saying that they had been moved by the Municipal Council's salary, pension regulations, severance pay, and other preferential terms many years ago, and had resigned from good jobs to work for the Municipal Council. The preferential treatment has been reduced, and they are considering resigning. It is said that some qualified employees of the Council have either resigned or are planning to leave because they believe that the original preferential terms have been greatly changed and are not worth staying for.

### Bombing in Pinghu City; Two Japanese Soldiers Injured

According to a person from Pinghu, the details of the Pinghu bombing are as follows: On the morning of the first of this month, when several Japanese soldiers were passing by the Tongji Restaurant on South Main Street in Pinghu City, several hand grenades were suddenly thrown from the upstairs of the restaurant. They exploded on the spot, and two Japanese soldiers were seriously injured. The order was chaotic for a time, and pedestrians and police avoided the area. The Japanese soldiers received the news and immediately rushed to the scene with a large force, setting up machine guns and opening fire as a show of force, but they did not catch the grenade thrower. Afterwards, the restaurant was closed for several days because of this.

### Four Banks to Offer Short-Term Acceptance Bills to Promote Active Finance in Various Industries

The Ministry of Finance's recommendation from the Central Bank, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Farmers Bank to promote acceptance bills has been approved, and the local banking guilds in various regions have been ordered to comply. Reporters from the "New Voice" learned from banking circles yesterday that the Central Bank, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Farmers Bank will soon offer short-term acceptance bills in accordance with the regulations for promoting acceptance bills. All measures have been determined, aiming to promote the development of agriculture, industry, and commerce and to invigorate local finance.

### U.S. Consul General to Shanghai, Gauss, Scheduled to Go to the U.S. Early Next Month; To Leave Shanghai Aboard the President Hoover; Various Groups in Shanghai Schedule Farewell Banquets

U.S. Consul General to Shanghai, Gauss, was ordered to be promoted to the first Minister to Australia. However, he has not yet received a telegram from the State Department in Washington, so he is still in Shanghai. According to consulate sources, Gauss is scheduled to leave Shanghai and return to the U.S. on April 2 aboard the President Hoover of the American President Lines. He will first report to the authorities in Washington, then meet his wife and son, Charles, spend some time in the U.S., and then return to his new post on schedule. It is said that Gauss will assume his new post in the capital of Australia in mid-July of this year.

Public Banquets

The American expatriate community in Shanghai, because Gauss has been supported by all parties during his tenure in Shanghai, have been sending invitations for public banquets to Gauss. It is reported that the American Chamber of Commerce and the American Association will jointly hold a banquet on the 30th of this month at the Columbia Country Club. The American Associated University Association will invite all staff of the American Consulate and Gauss himself to a dance and dinner party on the 27th of this month at the American Club. Foreign journalists will hold a banquet for Gauss on the 28th of this month in the "Gold Room" of the American Club. Gauss also attended a farewell banquet held by the Japanese Consul General to Shanghai, Miura, on Tuesday night.

Gauss's Brief History

Gauss is 53 years old and is a well-known diplomat. He joined the government in 1906 and was transferred to the Shanghai Consulate in 1907. He successively served as Counselor of the Embassy in Peiping and Consul General in Shanghai, before being transferred to the State Department in Washington. The following year, he was transferred to the position of Consul General at the Embassy in Paris. He has served in China for 33 years. During his time in China, he has traveled extensively in Peiping, Tientsin, Shanghai, Amoy, Jinan, Shenyang, and other places.

During his tenure, he was seen by all parties as a central figure as the Sino-Japanese War occurred. He interacted with all parties and gained the trust and love of the American expatriate community. He handled official duties day and night, with almost no peaceful days. On November 22 of last year, he met with Admiral Hepburn, Commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, on the flagship "Augusta," and paid a visit to the U.S. Ambassador. On the morning of the 23rd, he accompanied Admiral Hepburn to the Philippines to participate in the Far East Conference in Cuba, Philippines. In addition to Gauss and Admiral Hepburn, the U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines, Sayre, also attended, which was called the "Three Giants Conference." At that time, the Far East countries paid great attention to the Philippine Conference, especially the U.S. interests in the Far East and the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty. Gauss's trip back to the U.S. will be to report to his superiors on the results of last year's meeting.

Successor

On January 8 of this year, he was ordered by the State Department to be promoted to the first Minister to Australia. The position of Consul General here has not been decided by the authorities, so it has been delayed. Only his wife and son left last month. The consulate has not been notified of the successor to the position of Consul General here, and the State Department has not issued any orders. It is generally believed that Mr. Lockhart, Counselor of the Embassy in Peiping, will temporarily replace him, because Mr. Lockhart has twice acted as Gauss's replacement during his absence. When Gauss left Shanghai for the Philippines last winter, he was also replaced by Lockhart. According to Mr. Lockhart, he is also familiar with the situation in Shanghai, but in terms of diplomatic history, he seems to be inferior to Gauss. It is said that Gauss has a deep sense of reluctance to leave his second hometown, China.

### Registration Method for Stock of Domestically Produced Yarn and Fabrics

Since the implementation of the new regulations for applying for certificates of origin for domestically produced yarn and fabrics, the sales invoices or invoices of Chinese-owned yarn factories have been used as the basic supporting documents. Yarn factories are also required to issue a sales voucher as proof. Now, because the inventory of raw materials purchased by various factories in the past should have a registration method for auditing and verification, the relevant guilds and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce have agreed on the following methods: (1) Inventory registration: Factories that directly use yarn to manufacture dyed, woven, knitted underwear, handkerchiefs, etc. should use the original tax-paid certificate of the yarn and cloth factory as the basis. (2) Cotton cloth merchants and some factories that purchase yarn and cloth from dyeing and weaving factories to produce knitted underwear, handkerchiefs, and other products are allowed to use the sales invoices or invoices of Chinese-owned dyeing and weaving factories as registration documents. (3) Shenxin, Wing On, and other seventeen yarn factories have recently published advertisements in newspapers stating that all yarn sold before March 1 that has a bank or exchange warehouse receipt can be registered and supplemented with a sales voucher. Therefore, the stock of yarn for which sales vouchers can be supplemented should still be based on the vouchers. (4) The inventory registration event should be completed by the end of March. The various guilds have been notified to comply.

### British Women's Association Urges Voting in Municipal Council Election; The Association will Assist Members in the Process

The 1940 annual election of the Municipal Council of the Public Concession will be held on the 10th and 11th of next month. The candidates for British and American directors have been selected separately. It is reported that the British Women's Association of this port held a meeting at its headquarters on the afternoon of the 13th. The chairman, Mrs. Kahn, reported and urged voting in the election. It was stated that the most important thing is to participate in the election of the Municipal Council directors this year. Every member should engage in commerce, but also pay attention to this election. If members have any questions, the secretariat of the association will do its best to help each member. During the two European wars, the association worked hard to promote the raising of war funds, which was very tense.

### Coal Dust Stockpiles Increase, But Coal Prices Must be Quickly Stabilized; Reduction in Transportation Costs is Expected to be Implemented Soon

The price of fuel in Shanghai has soared previously due to the doubling of water transport costs and the hoarding of spot goods. Hotels, bathrooms, and cooked water shops have temporarily closed or are considering raising prices, which has invisibly increased the expenses of ordinary people. Due to the high cost of coal, the cost of production in factories has increased, and production has decreased. This is a major concern for Shanghai. Now, due to the smooth flow of sources and the abundance of spot goods in the market, people's hearts have become more stable. With the ceasefire between the Soviet Union and Finland, large investors have no intention of aggressively hoarding, and small investors are waiting and watching. The spot market is rarely visited. The prices of various fuels are gradually falling. Moreover, bituminous coal blocks arrive in port every other day and are unloaded into coal warehouses, so the coal block inventory is also increasing day by day. The Coal Industry Association is currently registering coal stocks. It is reported that about 10,000 tons have been registered. It is hoped that all coal companies will quickly register with the association to facilitate statistics.

Joint Meeting

The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, at the request of the Machine-Made Coal Briquette Industry Association, is trying to help small coal briquette factories so that they can continue to ship goods and supply the market. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce believes that the association's statement is factual. However, this matter is of great importance and must be discussed at length. It has been decided to convene a joint meeting of all coal dust companies at the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce on Hong Kong Road this afternoon at 3 PM to discuss the allocation of cheap coal dust. Yi Tai Hing, Da Long Hing, Tong Cheng, Han Cheng, and other coal companies will be invited to attend and participate in the discussion.

Clearing Warehouse Stock

The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously announced jointly with the coal industry and related groups that the deadline for clearing the coal briquette warehouse stock for those holding tickets was yesterday. A total of more than 20,000 tons were cleared yesterday. Yesterday, the person in charge of the industry association said that the spot goods of coal briquettes will increase in the future. If the cost of coal transportation is reduced, the price of briquettes can be lowered. It is also reported that the coal briquette manufacturers are working day and night to supply the market, increasing the spot goods. If this can be maintained permanently, panic can be reduced.

Supporting the Water Industry

The Shanghai Coal Industry Association previously agreed to supply cheap Kai Ping coal dust at the request of the cooked water industry. The coal industry agreed to their request and designated three members, Yi Tai Hing, Hua Zhong, and Yuan Tai, to supply one ton of cheap coal each at a price of 98 yuan. The cooked water industry immediately announced to its members that they would resume business and were very grateful for the coal industry's enthusiasm. Now, the Coal Industry Association believes that the cooked water shops are all small businesses and are closely related to the livelihood of ordinary people, so it is willing to continue to supply cheap coal. It is currently being planned, and once it is ready, it can be applied for. It is said that the market price will be lower than the first time.

### Customs Revenue in Occupied Areas Intercepted; Estimated at 43 Million Dollars; China's Current Inability to Repay Debts; Responsibility Clearly Does Not Rest with China

The Chinese government has long been determined to maintain creditworthiness. Since the customs revenue in the occupied areas was intercepted in 1938, it has been necessary to set up another method of repayment for the debts guaranteed by customs duties, which is only a temporary phenomenon. However, to show its sincere intentions, all customs duties under Chinese control have been deposited in the Central Bank for the repayment of foreign debts, and converted into foreign exchange at the legal rate. As for the intercepted customs revenue, which is deposited in the Yokohama Specie Bank, the total amount as of the end of last year was 43,153,000 dollars. This deposit can only be resolved after the end of the Sino-Japanese War. Therefore, China's current inability to repay domestic and foreign debts guaranteed by customs duties is not China's responsibility, which is a very obvious fact. The estimated customs duties intercepted in the main customs offices in 1938 and 1939 are listed below (excluding the customs offices in the three northeastern provinces):

Customs Office 1938 1939

Qinhuangdao $4,540,000 $6,350,000

Tianjin Customs $56,440,000 $67,590,000

Donghai Customs $4,020,000 $4,740,000

Jiao Customs $8,870,000 $28,450,000

Jianghai Customs $83,730,000 $166,800,000

### Japanese Izumo Warship, Which Suddenly Left Port a Few Days Ago, Returns to Shanghai

### U.S. Transport Ship, Gold Star, Leaves Shanghai Yesterday; Guam Arrives Here from Wuhu Yesterday; Luzon Scheduled to Sail West Next Monday

The U.S. transport ship Gold Star arrived in Shanghai with a heavy load from the Guam Naval Base on the 6th of this month. It left Shanghai yesterday afternoon to take this Hong Kong, Xiao Luzon, back to Guam.

Rear Admiral Glassford, Commander of the U.S. Yangtze River Flotilla, will change his flag to the Guam. Luzon is scheduled to set sail for Wuhu for defense next Monday. There are rumors that the U.S. Asiatic Fleet will come to Shanghai for a spring tour, but the U.S. Navy in Shanghai has not confirmed it.

### Aboard the Sinking Jingsheng Wheel; The Passengers' Screams Were Tragic; The Authorities' Negligence is Regrettable

The situation of the sinking of the Jingsheng Wheel in Ningbo, according to Mr. Zhan, who works in the medical field, was very tragic. He also had some criticisms of the local authorities' negligence. For the sake of past experience and future consideration, the situation is described as follows:

General Information About the Ship

According to Mr. Zhan, the Jingsheng Wheel in Ningbo has a gross tonnage of only 160 tons, a length of 95 feet, a width of 16 feet, a depth of 8 feet, and a draft of 6 feet. It was built in 1904 and has a horsepower of 150. It can sail about 9 nautical miles per hour. The bottom of the ship is pointed, not flat. The maximum number of passengers allowed on the ship is 298. The ship has always sailed between Ningbo and Zhenhai. After the establishment of the Ningbo Barge Transportation Company, it joined as a barge passenger ship, traveling between Ningbo and Zhenhaikou.

Passenger Situation

On the morning of the 2nd, the ship arrived in Yong from Zhenhaikou with passengers from the De Ping Wheel, and docked at the Sanbei Wharf on the Jiangbei bank. Passengers disembarked one after another. At that time, passengers waiting to board the Moufu Wheel hired ferry boats to the outside of the ship to board the cabin. The number of people was quite crowded. At about 1:50 PM, the Ningbo Air Defense Monitoring Post issued an air raid alert. At that time, I and four of my relatives and friends were also afraid of a ferry boat and planned to board the ship and take the Moufu Wheel back to Shanghai. When the ferry boat was about to approach the stern of the ship, I saw that the passengers on the ship were full, and the ship was overwhelmed. Because I was wary, I did not dare to board the ship.

A Glimpse of the Accident

At that time, the crew was still urging me to board the ship. However, my relatives and friends on the boat shared my views and decided to take the next barge. I ordered the crew to row back. In an instant, the ship had already undocked. I suddenly saw the ship leaning outward, very sharply. The whole ship was crying and shouting, and the situation was extremely tragic. In less than two minutes, the ship had sunk to the bottom of the water. At that time, the sound of crying stopped suddenly. Passengers in the cabins and middle cabins jumped into nearby ferry boats and into the water. However, the number of people was limited. Those who fell into the water mostly did not know how to swim and drowned tragically. The scene at that time was so sad that it cannot be described in words.

Responsibility

About a quarter of an hour after the ship sank, the Air Defense Post continued to issue an emergency alert. However, Japanese planes had already entered the country. The alert was lifted after about 20 minutes. At that time, the military police and rescue teams were all dispatched to rescue. The Xinjiang Bridge was also crowded with onlookers, and the situation was suddenly tense. At this time, four passengers who had escaped had jumped onto the ferry boat I was on and were taken ashore. Eight lives on one boat were lucky to survive. Mr. Zhan talked about the Ningbo Barge Transportation Company's excessive leniency in limiting the number of passengers, the lack of strict inspection by the shipping authorities, and the lack of discipline among passengers in public order, and expressed deep regret. The lives of the people in this extraordinary period should not be sacrificed in such a meaningless way.

Learn from the Past

According to news from the shipping industry in this port, since the sinking of the Jingsheng barge in Ningbo, the authorities are actively planning to improve the method of barging passengers on ships between Yong and Zhen. In addition to considering increasing the number of direct Shanghai-Ningbo ships within the possible scope, the Ningbo Shipping Administration and the military and political authorities will strictly regulate the method of barging passengers and goods. Five implementation methods have now been drafted: (1) In accordance with the regulations of the Zhejiang Provincial Shipping Administration, all ships traveling in inland rivers and offshore seas must be strictly inspected. (2) The number of passengers must be limited and must not exceed the regulations of the Administration and the Zhejiang Customs. (3) The weight of cargo must not exceed the deadweight tonnage. (4) Passengers must enter and exit the ship separately to maintain order. (5) The police authorities will send personnel to maintain order at the wharves. The above methods will be announced and implemented after the various agencies have discussed and agreed on them. Regarding the bodies of the Jingsheng sinking ship, the Aftermath Committee is still continuing to salvage them. On the morning of the 14th, another five male and female bodies were retrieved.

### Lido Ballroom Owner Gao Xinbao Shot Dead - Assassin Lay in Wait in Front of Yipinxiang - Gao Shot as He Stepped Out of Hotel and Entered Car - Died of Three Gunshot Wounds

Last night around 9 o'clock, a shooting occurred in front of the Yipinxiang Hotel on Yuqiaqing Road. The victim was Gao Xinbao, the owner of the Lido Ballroom, who died on the spot. Details are recorded below.

Ballroom Owner

Gao Xinbao, a local, was 54 years old. He had a significant amount of potential influence in Shanghai society. He originally lived in a building on Hardoon Road, but later, due to the establishment of the Lido Ballroom on Meadow Lane, he moved his residence to the Lido.

Busy with Social Engagements

Because Gao had extensive social connections, he went out every night for social engagements. Recently, about half a year ago, some friends opened Room 20 in the Yipinxiang Hotel on Yuqiaqing Road, registered under the name "Jin Ji." Gao went there every night to rest, enjoy himself, or play mahjong.

Shot While Entering Car

Yesterday evening around 7 o'clock, Gao arrived at Yipinxiang in his private car, number 11311, and waited until 9:30. His friends had not yet arrived, so the mahjong game did not materialize. At 9:55, Gao got up and walked out of Yipinxiang, crossed the road, and was about to get into the car when, unexpectedly, an assassin who had been lying in wait next to a lamppost near the racetrack's low wall,

Fatal Wounds

Seeing Gao arrive, the assassin suddenly jumped out and fired three shots at Gao in rapid succession, all of which hit him. Gao fell to the ground with a thud, blood gushing out. Nearby police officers rushed over, lifted Gao into the car, and rushed him to Renji Hospital. After a doctor's examination, it was found that he had been shot once in the abdomen, once in the left ear, and once in the left leg. Immediate first aid was administered, but he died soon after due to critical injuries and excessive blood loss.

Assassin Flees

Upon receiving the report, the police dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to the scene to arrest the assassin, who had already fled without a trace. Several empty bullet casings were found and are being investigated. Gao's body will be taken to the coroner's office for examination. It is noted that Gao was detained by a certain party in the autumn of last year, claiming that Gao was suspected of something. He was released after ten days.

### Estate Lawsuit Over the Deceased Zhang Yisun, Comprador of Jinlong Foreign Firm - Concubine Accuses Principal Wife of Seizing Assets - Gold Bars, Gold Pounds, Gold Ingots, etc. at Issue - Also 8,000 Bags of Rice and 100,000 Jin of Wine Stockpiled

The late Zhang Yisun, a native of Ningbo, was a comprador at the Jinlong Foreign Firm at 549 Sichuan Road. He had a wife and a concubine. The wife, Zhang Hu, lives at [address in French]. She has three sons: the eldest, Qi'ang, currently resides at [address in French]; Qi'hong, currently resides at [address in French]; and the youngest, Qi'cheng, currently resides at [address in French]. All three sons are engaged in commerce and live separately. The concubine, Zhang Zhao, is 32 years old this year, a fellow villager of Zhang, and lives at [address in French]. She has one son and one daughter, Zhang Hua and Zhang Xia, both of whom are minors. Zhang Yisun possessed considerable assets during his lifetime, and after his death last spring, an estate dispute arose.

Zhang Zhao, the Concubine

Now, acting as the legal representative, she, along with her son Zhang Hua and daughter Zhang Xia, has engaged lawyer Yuan Dingxin to file a lawsuit with the Second Special District Court's criminal division, accusing Zhang Hu and others of jointly embezzling property. It is claimed that the plaintiff's husband, Zhang Yisun, was engaged in commerce during his lifetime and accumulated a considerable fortune. Unfortunately, he died of illness at the plaintiff's residence at [address in French] on March 14th of last year. However,

The Principal Wife Hu

Li Zi Qi'ang, Qi'hong, Qi'cheng, and others, while the deceased husband's body was still awaiting burial, engaged in the act of seizing the estate, forcibly taking away the personally signed general account books, deeds, passbooks, seals, checkbooks, and the key to the safe deposit box at the China Trust Company from the iron box. Tens of thousands of dollars' worth of assets, including dozens of gold bars, more than two hundred gold pounds, five gold ingots, and gold jewelry, were completely

Stolen and Concealed

Furthermore, they privately sold 8,000 bags of rice and 100,000 jin of wine that the deceased husband had purchased, and divided the proceeds among themselves. The plaintiff, being the concubine of Yisun, naturally has a reasonable share of the estate. Moreover, besides the defendants, Yisun has two children who are both under the plaintiff's guardianship. How could they be allowed to arbitrarily control the estate? Initially, because the deceased husband's remains were not yet interred, she could not bear

To Immediately Initiate Litigation

She repeatedly asked relatives and friends Ma Jiliang and Jiang Yiping to mediate, but to no avail. Therefore, she requests that they be prosecuted. Yesterday, judge Jiang Liquan of the court opened the court to summon them. The first and second defendants did not arrive. Only Zhang Qi'hong and Qi'cheng, accompanied by their lawyers, appeared in court. The two defendants were interrogated separately in court. They admitted to storing 8,000 bags of rice and mortgaging them to Fukang Qianzhuang, etc. After verifying the statements, the court decided to reschedule the hearing to the 22nd of this month. The defendants were released on bail.

### Huge Sum Robbed from Bank of Communications

Yesterday morning (the 15th) at about 9 o'clock, two employees dispatched by the Bank of Communications at No. 3 Avenue Petain in the French Concession were moving an iron box containing 30,000 yuan in legal tender to its branch at No. 889 Avenue Joffre nearby. At the time, an armed bodyguard was also assigned to accompany and escort them. Unexpectedly, when they were near No. 393 Avenue Petain, four bandits wielding weapons suddenly rushed out, disarmed the bodyguard, and then robbed the iron box. After the bandits obtained the large sum, they escaped in a car that had been prearranged. According to police investigations, the car used by the gang of thieves belonged to the Xiang Sheng Motor Company, with license plate number 18465. Later, it was found near the Xin Kang Li area on Connaught Road. According to the chauffeur of the car, he was instructed by his passengers to drive to Singapore Road. However, when the car reached Jiaozhou Road, two passengers in the car suddenly pulled out guns, forced him to get out of the car, and entered an alley where he was placed under surveillance. At about 9:30, one of the robbers arrived and told the robber who was monitoring him, "The mission is accomplished," and then released him, telling him that the car was now parked on Connaught Road, etc.

### Stolen Car from Two and a Half Years Ago Suddenly Found - Japanese Man Driving it to Obtain License - Detained by Police

According to the English-language China Press, two and a half years ago, when the Shanghai War was in full swing, a staff member of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Health Department, Mr. Stodart, parked his Austin car in an open space in the Shanghai Municipal Council, but it was reported missing. It could not be found. However, the car had theft insurance, so Mr. Stodart had already received compensation from the insurance company. Until the morning of the 12th of this month, a Japanese man drove the car to the license office on Rue Moliere to obtain a license. Police officers checked the car's license plate number and discovered that it was the car that belonged to Mr. Stodart, and that the engine was still in good condition. According to the Japanese man, he bought the car in Nanjing and drove it to Shanghai to obtain a license. The car has now been detained at the Central Police Station. The insurance company may demand to buy it back.

### Punishment for Rice Shop Owner

Yang Xixiang (31 years old), a native of Luodian, who owns the Yongfa Rice Shop at 895 Rue du Consulat and Route Pere Robert, recently paved the inside of the five-sheng and one-sheng measuring containers used in the store with cement, creating a false bottom of two or three tenths, to exploit the common people and make profits. The matter was discovered by the police on the afternoon of the 6th of this month. They went to expose the secret and arrested the shop owner Yang Xixiang, along with the two measuring containers, and sent them to the Second Special District Court. The police lawyer prosecuted him for violating the law against fraud. After Judge Huang Yan finished hearing the case, the verdict was announced yesterday morning. Yang Xixiang was found guilty of fraud by violating weights and measures and was sentenced to five months in prison, which could be commuted to a fine of three yuan per day. The two measuring containers were confiscated.

### Robbery on Saposai Road - Detectives Rushed to Surround and Arrest - Bandits Took Advantage of Opportunity to Escape

Yesterday morning at about 10 o'clock, four robbers suddenly came to the home of Xia Tongfu, a native of Nanhui who was engaged in the rice business, on the second floor of No. 289, an alley on Saposai Road (near the intersection of Rue Pere Robert) in the French Concession. Two of the robbers held pistols, threatening them to remain silent. At the time, the robbers were dividing the loot when one of the maids, an older woman named A'e, took the opportunity to escape out the door and ran to inform the nearby police officer. She telephoned the police station. At that time, the case of the robbery of a huge sum of 30,000 yuan from the Bank of Communications on Avenue Joffre had just occurred less than two hours earlier. The police detectives had not yet unloaded their weapons, so they immediately rushed to the scene by car. More than a hundred Chinese and foreign detectives went and surrounded the alley on all sides, firing several shots in a show of force. Unexpectedly, the robbers were inherently cunning and knew things were not good. They had already abandoned the stolen goods and fled before the police arrived.

### The Wrecked Xin'anna Steamer Entered the Dock for Repairs Yesterday

### Missing Elementary School Student Case - Kidnappers Sent Letter Demanding Ransom - Intending to Extort 50,000 Yuan - Letter Sent from Benniu

Zhou Xisheng, a native of Changzhou who runs a coppersmith shop on Gordon Road, has a six-year-old son named Wenzhao. On the afternoon of the 10th of this month, at 3:20, he went to school at the Life Elementary School at No. 1085 of the same road with his older sister Jin Feng. On the way, they met Xu Ronghu, a native of Changzhou who was previously an apprentice at the coppersmith shop in Zhabei. Xu Ronghu spoke to Wenzhao, gave him candy to eat, and then left. Unexpectedly, after school was dismissed, Wenzhao went missing. Therefore, Zhou Xisheng suspects the former shop

Apprentice Xu Ronghu

He was highly suspected, and he twisted him over at the Taiji coppersmith workshop at 120 Great West Road and handed him over to the Putuo Road police station for delivery to the First Special District Court. He confessed that the child Zhou Wenzhao was abducted by a fellow apprentice Xu Genda and hidden somewhere in Hongkou, etc. He hesitated to offer other confessions and was ordered to be remanded for investigation. Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang Shuzi of the Criminal Court 3 continued the trial. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu stated that the date was being changed. The victim, Zhou Xisheng, received a

Anonymous Letter

Sent by mail from the Benniu Post Office in Changzhou, stating that if they wanted the child Wenzhao to be returned, they would have to pay 50,000 yuan, otherwise it would be very dangerous. It is presumed that this letter was definitely written by Xu Genda in an attempt to get lucky. Xu is also a native of Changzhou, and Zhou's child was hidden in Changzhou by him, etc. He also requested a postponement. Judge Jiang approved it and rescheduled the hearing.

### Scarce Source of Chinese Medicine - Selling Price Increases Daily - Only Two Batches of Sichuan Medicine Arrived This Year

Since the Shanghai Incident, prices of all industries have risen sharply. Chinese medicine, due to wartime traffic obstacles, has become scarce and prices have increased significantly. According to news from the industry, in the past, Sichuan medicine arrived in Shanghai at least ten times a month. Since the incident, the arrival times have become uncertain. Since the beginning of this year, only two batches have arrived in Shanghai. The first batch arrived in January, and the second batch just arrived a few days ago. The cost of water and freight has increased even more than the first batch, so the selling price must also be slightly increased. According to the survey of medicinal materials, Sichuan lovage and Sichuan eucommia used to be only seventy or eighty yuan per dan, but now they have risen to two hundred and twenty or thirty yuan. Orange pith used to be more than four hundred yuan per dan, but now it has risen to three thousand several hundred yuan. The other increases are also several times higher. The industry once convened a meeting to discuss the price increase issue, and a solution has been decided. The burden has been further increased these past few days.

### Finance - Environment No Longer Favorable for Bulls - Foreign Exchange Buying Gradually Subsides - US Dollar Lengthens, British Gold Stabilizes

Yesterday's foreign exchange market was affected by the sharp drop of 0.0625 in the overseas exchange rate between the US and the UK. Therefore, the HSBC US dollar quotation in this city was only 6.1875. The Dutch and Japanese exchange rates also shrank, while other exchange rates such as the British exchange rate were stable. The domestic market situation is gradually becoming clear because the environment is no longer favorable for bulls. Furthermore, because HSBC has always been willing to maintain the 4s 1.125d rate, it is said that it has already sold more than 1 million pounds in the past few days. In addition, the US bank also turned to selling intentions on the same day. Most speculators are temporarily watching the situation, and stable investors are also taking profits. Therefore, as a result, except for the spot rate, which remained unchanged, the others all hardened. At the morning opening, the exchange rate fell by more than 0.05, so the British exchange rate continued to be flat and the US exchange rate tightened. Then, speculators and Japanese foreign firms continued to trade futures, causing the US exchange rate to shrink slightly after opening, once quoted at 6.0625. However, the British gold still relied on HSBC to maintain its position and stabilized. Then, as there were many floating shares to be released, and the US bank also sold, it gradually rebounded. By the time of the noon close, it had lengthened to 6.0375. In the afternoon, it was initially flat. Then, as speculators came to settle again, and the US bank was still full of selling intentions, the US exchange rate hardened to 6.0375 by the time of the evening close.

The US bank's spot US exchange rate was 6.034375, but after there was no response, the situation continued to harden due to the fact that speculators came to spit out a little, and there were rumors of a Japanese-Soviet conflict in the market.

### Times Changed - Bullish Golden Market Took Profits at High Prices - Headline Created an Unprecedented High Price of 5,170 Yuan - Drafts Lengthened Creating a Disconnected Situation

Yesterday's spot and black market situation for pure gold, the situation gradually changed, the good scenery has moved, not as the number of days leaping straight up, originally because the foreign exchange is particularly stable, operators continue to look at the rising mind, when frustrated, and in the past who held the goods have obtained huge profits, full of settlement intentions, take advantage of the high prices to come out, the number is not small, the whole day is the most issued by cash account and securities group, the second is sold by scattered lakes, and the customer's eating stomach is thin, only money exchange industry still sees the purchase activity, to the whole day's process, the opening is still high, but step by step, the step down, so the feeling that the head and tail are not connected, the situation is quite obvious, to the morning opening under the competition to buy, once created an unprecedented high peak of 5,170 yuan, then each group sold to the market, and at this time the US exchange rate turned hard, the supply exceeded demand, then turned down, to noon has been small to 5,070 yuan, although slightly rebounded, but the retail investors resold, also pressed to 5,075 yuan, not long after the afternoon opening, then another ten yuan, but at this time a securities group suddenly turned to buying intention, efforts have entered, rose to 5,097 yuan, died because at this time outside The newspaper continued to report loose and hard, and the number of sellers increased again, and there were rumors of Japanese-Soviet conflicts in the market, and the number of people rushing to sell was numerous. Until before the evening close, a low of 5,030 yuan appeared. As a result, it was 5,033 yuan, a decrease of 97 yuan compared to the previous day. The transaction for the whole day was more than 4,000 taels, and the gold ornaments in silver shops also dropped by ten yuan. Customs gold remained flat.

Pure Gold Fell, White Yuan Weak

From the beginning of the morning, each tael (ten taels) first opened, inheriting the remaining prestige of the previous day, and the US exchange rate was still tight, and the atmosphere was still very hot. Money exchange industries, etc., released the market for purchase, resulting in another horizontal jump of 40 yuan at the opening. A certain securities group entered 50 taels of silver from the silver shop for 5,170 yuan. Unexpectedly, a certain cash account took the opportunity to come out, plus another securities group also came to pour out, and the situation was unsustainable. It fell by 60 yuan. A certain cash account sold 50 taels to the money exchange industry for 5,110 yuan. After this, a certain gold shop and a certain money exchange industry suddenly came to fish, and the price soared by 45 yuan. The money exchange industry entered 50 taels of securities help for 5,155 yuan. However, the US exchange rate suddenly reported a hardening, and people's hearts went down. A certain silver shop sold on behalf of a scattered multi-sell, coupled with silver shop help and securities help, etc., again saw a sharp drop of 75 yuan. A certain silver shop spat out 50 taels to the money exchange industry for 5,080 yuan. At that time, the securities group had a reinvestment, and a certain silver shop also came to search in, and then rose by another 20 yuan. The gold shop entered 50 taels of a certain silver shop for 5,100 yuan. As a result, the exchange market reported a hardening again, and the selling wind rose again. Cash accounts, money exchange industries, and securities help, etc., rushed to plug, and then pressed by 20 yuan. The securities helped out 50 taels of gold for 5,070 yuan.

Died for money exchange industry and a certain cash account resold, and returned to 5,075 yuan for the noon closing price. In the afternoon, the first mountain gold shop came out of a certain gold shop ten taels, still for 5,075 yuan. After a short time, the money exchange industry spat out ten taels to the securities group, inferior to 5,065 yuan. At that time, a certain securities group suddenly absorbed more than 300 taels, and was suddenly pulled up by 32 yuan. The silver shop entered 20 taels of money exchange industry for 5,097 yuan. After the foreign exchange US dollar reported loosening, a certain securities group turned to sell, and the gold shop and retail investors competed to plug, and the price plummeted by 60 yuan.

The new peer price is the same as the upper price, and the purchase is reduced by about 15 yuan.

### Securities: Domestic Debt Gradually Rises, Foreign Stocks Rebound

The securities gray market showed a continued upward trend yesterday, with investor sentiment relatively calm. Optimism regarding British aid to China gradually increased, leading short sellers to cover their positions. This support boosted the confidence of long buyers, and while the range of market price fluctuations was small, the volatility was still within normal parameters. At the close, rumors of contact between the Soviets and Manchuria emerged, pushing gray market prices up by another one or two dimes. In the morning, Lien Ho saw the most short covering, and Hsieh Ta also experienced a surge in demand. Yung Kang and Lien Yi also consistently bought, while Chang Kee, Hung Kang, and Sheng Ta sold. Market prices were firm. In the afternoon, Chiu Feng covered positions, and Lien Yi, Jun Heng, and Hu Ho Kee made purchases. Lien Ho and Hsieh Ta began to release positions, with Yi Chang entering Class C and exiting Class E. Market prices continued to rise slightly. Closing prices were better than the previous day by 1.5 to 3 dimes. Trading volume was around 600,000 yuan. A concise table is provided below:

Stock Trading: 50 shares of Chung Nan Bank were traded at a price of 60 yuan. Yesterday, the stock market opened slightly weaker due to cautious buying, with buyers unwilling to aggressively push prices higher. However, sellers were eager to liquidate, forcing them to sell at the lower opening prices. Subsequently, a surge in buyers cleared the floating positions, and prices began to rise. Trading was moderate in the morning. In the afternoon, the market suddenly became active, with significant trading volume. Jardine Matheson shares surged from an opening low of 108 yuan to close at 116.5 yuan, with buyers still not fully satisfied at that price. Demand for China Land shares was also strong, with the price rising to 13.4 yuan at the close. These two stocks were the highlights of yesterday's trading. Rubber shares opened quietly, with widespread buying interest. Prices also made some progress and closed steadily. The recent consecutive days of decline in raw rubber prices were undoubtedly due to the uncertain exchange rate between the British pound and the US dollar, war finances, strict controls, and various other factors.

### Yarn and Cotton: Yarn Market Experiences Wild Fluctuations, April Futures Trade Opens with Foreign Reductions Converted to One Hundred Yuan

The yarn market experienced rapid advances and retreats with swift changes, due to the fluctuating US dollar exchange rate, leading to investor uncertainty. In reality, after consecutive days of sharp rises, some profit-takers moved to liquidate positions. However, approaching the 1,000 yuan mark, there was a period of struggle. Currently, there is some demand for actual yarn in the South China region. The March peak for 20-count horse yarn reached 997 yuan, with a low of 970 yuan. April trading has already begun with over one hundred bundles traded at a price of 1,000 yuan, seemingly at a 3/7 split with a fixed price of 120 yuan.

The spot yarn market opened this morning with news of the British pound/US dollar exchange rate weakening to 5.5. Market sentiment was enthusiastic, briefly surging to 997 yuan. However, once this price was reached, there were few buyers, and prices gradually declined to a low of 835 yuan. Buying activity then resumed, pushing prices back up to 991 yuan. Subsequently, news of the US dollar exchange rate tightening and then loosening led to a gradual decline in the market to 971 yuan. According to half-day trading statistics, 2,575 bundles were traded. The spot price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was roughly the same as the previous day, with no significant change. Today, 55 bales of cotton yarn were exported to Hong Kong, 60 bales to Tianjin, and 100 bales to Yantai. The amount purchased by each gang is listed as follows:

### Cotton Mills Need Improvement

Cotton trading was still not weak, and demand from mills gradually improved, resulting in a stable but firm market. In addition, the local inventory is gradually dwindling, so industry sentiment remains optimistic. The factory delivery price for Nantai Cang and Tongzhou cotton has reached 220 yuan. 896 bales of Subei cotton arrived at Tonghua factory. The spot cotton trading situation is listed below:

Another news item reports that New York cotton futures opened firm due to positive news from Liverpool. Later, the market strengthened as spot trading improved and industry players also engaged in some trading. As a result, closing prices were more than ten pounds higher than the previous day. The Indian cotton market also rose yesterday, with projected increases of six rupees. Egyptian cotton rose by more than ten pounds.

The Shanghai foreign cotton market remains quiet due to tight forward exchange rates and high cotton prices. In addition, overseas cotton markets have risen, so trading in the market is rather quiet. Mills remain silent, not planning to purchase raw cotton. The factory delivery price based on a US dollar exchange rate of 6.3125 yuan is listed below:

### Grains: Foreign Rice Stabilizes, Northern Transport Increases

The rice market has been on a downward trend recently, experiencing another sharp drop, breaking the early market closing price. Yesterday, the initial sales market was stagnant. Floating speculative households sought to quickly unload inventory, with No. 1 Saigon rice selling for only 42 yuan, Fire Sorted at 41 yuan, 40 yuan and 5 jiao, No. 2 Saigon at 37 yuan and 7 jiao, and Broken Tip at 32 yuan and 3 yuan. However, foreign firms were unwilling to sell off further. Original local rice dealers were still looking to foreign firms as examples. Trading was mostly just short covering, so the number of available units were relatively scarce, and the market turned stable. Buyers took advantage of the low prices, and rice dealers opened this month's prices to foreign firms for original packaged goods; No. 1 Saigon at 51 yuan, No. 2 at 46.5 yuan, No. 2 Siamese at 46.6 yuan, and Small Sorted at 47 yuan for a total of 4-500 tons. Thus, sales in the market gradually turned brisk, and general stores followed suit, with prices rebounding. By the close, the market had recovered all of the declines; No. 1 Saigon at 42.8 yuan, No. 2 at 38 yuan, Fire Sorted at 42 yuan, 41.8 yuan, Small Sorted at 38.5 yuan, and Broken Tip at 34 yuan. While glutinous rice sales were not smooth, sellers were hesitant to lower prices further due to previous losses. As a result, market prices showed no change. Thick and Thin粳, early and late rice showed no increase yesterday. The gray market was still quiet, with no changes in price.

Previously, the local market suffered because local rice was blocked from entering the concessions, causing panic and soaring rice prices. Fortunately, large quantities of foreign rice arrived steadily, so market prices have recently fallen slightly. It is heard that the food panic in North China is even more severe than in the local market, and the puppet regime lacks resources, so it cannot purchase foreign rice in large quantities, raising concerns about public food supply. Merchants have recently purchased from Vietnam and transported rice directly, and some is transshipped from Hong Kong. Northern merchants in Shanghai have also purchased a small amount. It is known that today's Yong Sheng ship to Tianjin, in addition to the 1,191 packages of foreign rice carried from Hong Kong to Yantai and Tianjin, also loaded more than 2,000 packages in Shanghai, 1,121 packages to Tianjin and 1,166 packages to Yantai (祖).

### Flour and Wheat Stabilize, Factory Prices Said to Increase After Flat Sale Period Ends

The flour market was initially weak but later stabilized, with few highlights. The continuous decline in sales and limited shipments to the inland and rural areas are the causes for this trend. However, there is talk that factory prices will increase by 3 yuan after the flat sale period ends, so those holding goods are unwilling to sell quickly. The market held firm in the morning. Later in the day, flour prices rose, following the rise in rice prices. Green Cannon brand was at 14.8 yuan, Old Car brand was at 14.45 yuan, and Battleship brand was at 14.2 yuan, with 3-5,000 bags traded. Phoenix flour was at 14 yuan, with 1,000 bags traded. On the 16th, 2,000 bags of flour were shipped to Tianjin.

There was little trading in wheat, and the market was mediocre. Recently, credit has been tight, and merchants and stores have been slow to take inventory, while sellers have been reluctant to lower prices due to high costs. As a result, only three or four truckloads of Wuxi wheat were sold at a price of 24.5 yuan. The market eased slightly.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Soybean Sales Not Declining

Although soybean trading decreased yesterday, the momentum has not waned. Oil mills, inland mills, local stores, and speculators all made inquiries. Market prices showed little significant change. High-quality soybeans rose slightly by 3-4 jiao, while mid-grade soybeans stabilized as the previous market increase was excessive. Combined market transactions included Nanjing soybeans per car at 22 yuan to 21.5 yuan, Yangzhou mountain soybeans per car at 22 yuan to 19.5 yuan, Bengbu soybeans per car at 15.5 yuan, Chuzhou soybeans per car at 23.5 yuan, and Dingjiazhou soybeans at 26.5 yuan.

### Seafood: Shrimp Tails Continue to Ease

The shrimp tail market has weakened due to slow sales and abundant inventory. The current market opened with mid tails at 218 yuan to 231 yuan, high fields shrimp at 253 yuan, and Kanhao tails at 194 yuan to 197 yuan, down by 20 yuan from the previous market. Domestically produced Wenzhou tails sold for 170 yuan. 37 bales of new Bombay tails arrived, with good color and quality, and were immediately sold at 222.2 yuan.

### Old News Re-Copied: Sixty-Seven Years Ago (325)

(From this newspaper published in the 12th year of Tongzhi during the late Qing Dynasty)

Providing Green Beans as Relief

The best way to provide famine relief is to adapt to local conditions and the needs of the time, such as providing money, rice, or congee. My friend came from Henan province and described the dire situation of the famine-stricken people in Xiuwu and Jiyuan. He said: "Currently, there are thousands of miles of barren land, and starving people are everywhere. Fortunately, many philanthropists are overseeing the relief efforts. However, in remote areas, people on the verge of death, even if given money for grain, how can they cook for themselves? These gentlemen travel dozens of miles a day, distributed over the steep mountains, providing assistance to each household. But even if they have the talent, energy, and thought, they are unable to achieve full reach. Therefore, recently, money, grain, and congee have been given out together, and in addition, there is also a provision of green beans. Last year, the green bean harvest in the Suzhou area was very abundant, and the price was also very low. Using this to provide relief to disaster victims has three benefits: because the land in the Northwest is high and dry, the people there are prone to dryness-related ailments, and moreover, starving bodies are even more susceptible. Adding this to congee can benefit the intestines, which is the first benefit. The price of green beans is cheaper than rice, by as much as thirty to forty percent. If one purchases a hundred catties of rice, they can get thirty or forty more catties of green beans. Using this as additional relief can provide for a hundred more people, which can save a hundred more lives. Expanding this, over several months, it can save millions of lives, which is the second benefit. Looking back at the regulations for disaster relief in the past, when encountering a rare disaster and soaring rice prices, green beans are the most unbiased and beneficial option among beans and grains. It also has the effect of general well-being. The weather will soon be getting hotter, and this item will be even more suitable. The words of the ancients are indeed not deceiving. Using this as an example, is today different from what the ancients said? Although the output of these beans, when combined, is not as much as that of millet and wheat, if several hundred catties are purchased for relief, the floating expenses will be reduced, and the real benefits will be much greater. Compared to those who transport grain thousands of miles, how is it that their inclination is reversed, which is the third benefit. All these three benefits are what is called adapting to local conditions and the needs of the time."

### The European War and Crime (Part Two)

— Shi Tao

The Decline in Crime Rate - England

What strange crimes could possibly occur in a darkened London? Would crimes taking advantage of the blackout occur at several times the rate of the past? Before the implementation of the blackout at the start of the war, everyone deeply cherished this thought. In fact, one now hears often of instances of snatching women's purses under cover of darkness. For this reason, recently women no longer carry their purses under their arms, but carry them by hand.

According to the London Metropolitan Police's highest authorities, they understood that the trend of crime following the war had not changed at all. The number of crimes has instead shown a tendency to decline. Most of these are petty theft kinds of crimes. As for robbery cases, those are extremely rare. The authorities consider the decline in crime to be very honorable, and pointed out the following reasons for the decline in crime:

1.  Due to troop mobilization and the need for manpower in industrial sectors.
2.  Police capabilities have doubled compared to pre-war levels.
3.  National unity and joint efforts to overcome national difficulties.

Therefore, the authorities believe that there is no need to seek special methods of suppression for general crimes simply because it is wartime. The authorities' focus is not on uncovering crimes, but on preventing social unrest. The more laborious task, of course, is guarding against enemy spies. They are implementing strict controls on the departure and entry of travelers. Telegrams, letters, and printed materials are all being ruthlessly inspected. In hotels and other places where the public gathers, slogans are posted, such as "Do not be exploited by the enemy; careless talk often leaks central secrets" to remind citizens to pay attention. In England, flooded with exiles from various countries, there is a real need for vigilance in this area.

What is most noteworthy in Britain today is the problem of juvenile delinquency, where children who have left the supervision of their fathers and elder brothers are not attending school in their places of refuge and are committing crimes. The number of these crimes is increasing day by day, thus becoming a problem of social education. As for general crime, it is not becoming more acute because of wartime.

No Crime - France

Of France's total population of 43 million, about six million men are galloping under the banners of the army protecting the motherland. Therefore, those remaining in French society now are only women, children, and elderly men without the vitality to live. Even in peacetime, French newspapers would typically publish no more than one or two crime-related news stories per month. From the start of the war until today, half a year later, it is almost impossible to find a single crime-like criminal act. All the guys who are capable of committing crimes have been drafted to the front lines. However, the reporting of Communism is being carried out vigorously. Originally, the French believed that the orderly progress of each month was not as desirable as the arrival of chaos. Once the motherland is in danger, they will demonstrate extraordinary latent power, with everyone performing actions for which they are responsible. Therefore, today's France is in a state of extreme seriousness. Women have taken on the roles of men. Of course, in this extraordinary period, there are bound to be many unfortunate events, but French women are capable of enduring them.

In today's France, there is no trace of any criminal behavior reflected from the war to be found.

### The Key to Fate

— Huang Jiayin

The most painful thing in the world is the inability to grasp one's own destiny. The most foolish thing in the world is unconditionally surrendering the key to one's own destiny to others.

However, in our surroundings, there are thousands upon thousands of people who are abandoning their sovereignty over their own destinies and unconditionally surrendering the key to their destinies to others.

The so-called sovereignty over one's destiny refers not only to the spiritual aspect, but also to the physical aspect.

It is said that the number of Chinese people who die from tuberculosis is the highest among all countries in the world. However, due to ignorance, poverty, complacency, fear, superstition, and various other reasons, we have still not made significant progress in tuberculosis prevention. Therefore, every day there are many unfortunate compatriots who are unconditionally handing over their sovereignty over their lives to germs. By the time the disease is incurable, the germs will transfer the key to their destinies to the god of death. At that time, it will be too late to resist or struggle.

Since we know the dangers of tuberculosis, we should quickly face reality and rise up to fight tuberculosis germs. If we want to reclaim our sovereignty over our destinies, and we want to seize the keys to our destinies, we should implement tuberculosis prevention education and support tuberculosis prevention movements.

### Mental Hygiene Movement

— Mo Ming

Mental hygiene is just as important as physical hygiene. Physical hygiene focuses on the health of the body; mental hygiene focuses on the health of the spirit. Strictly speaking, the workings of the spirit are far more complex and elusive than the body, and therefore more prone to disease, so mental hygiene should be given even more attention. Currently, most people overlook this point, which is a serious error. If mental hygiene is neglected, deficiencies will occur in the spiritual aspect, and an individual's thoughts and actions will become abnormal. As a result, relationships between people cannot be adjusted, and various crimes and difficult problems in society will arise from this. If mental illness is not paid attention to, and allowed to gradually deepen, it will eventually turn into madness, which is a truly terrible outcome. Therefore, the mental hygiene movement is a movement that promotes people to pay closer attention to spiritual health. Its goals are very bright, far-reaching, and worthy of praise.

The origin of the mental hygiene movement is a very moving story. We know that humanity has always used inhumane and unreasonable methods to deal with the mentally ill. The darkness and horror of asylums are no less than prisons. In our country, madmen are even believed to be possessed by evil spirits and often suffer cruel and violent treatment. In fact, it is obvious that this wrong method is of no use, but I really don't understand why mankind is always stubbornly clinging to mistakes, allowing the mentally ill to suffer all kinds of tribulations and endure all kinds of hardships for thousands of years, and yet remaining unmoved. However, the humane revolutionary movement to solve the shackles of madmen was launched in a grand and energetic way. This was thirty years ago, when an American college student from Connecticut named Clifford Whittingham Beers, suffered from mental illness and was sent to an asylum, where he spent three years of subhuman life, experiencing all kinds of pain and witnessing all kinds of dark situations. He was deeply stimulated in his heart, and after being discharged from the hospital, he vowed to devote the rest of his life to improving the treatment of the mentally ill and promoting mental hygiene. He initially worked hard to appeal to all sectors, and wrote a book in vivid language about his experiences in the asylum, called "A Mind That Found Itself," as publicity. Although many people were moved by him at the time, most people in society coldly discriminated against him. In 1908, he organized the first mental hygiene movement organization in human history, the "Connecticut Society for Mental Hygiene," whose members included only thirteen people, including himself and his father and brothers. The following year, as a result of his active promotion, the National Committee for Mental Hygiene also was established, but only eleven representatives participated. One can imagine how difficult the mental hygiene movement was at that time. However, Beers had an indomitable spirit: he opened the road through thorny bushes, managing bitterly, and his sincerity finally won the sympathy and support of more people. The attitude of people in the community gradually became enlightened, and as a result, the mental hygiene movement not only swept across the United States, but also responded in various countries around the world. In 1918, Canada was the first to establish a formal national organization, followed by Belgium, the United Kingdom, and Brazil. Then Hungary, Germany, Japan, Italy, Argentina, Australia, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, Finland, India, New Zealand, France, Spain, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Austria, Denmark, Norway, Sweden and other countries also rose up one after another. In the 25th year of the Republic of China, our country also established the Chinese Association for Mental Hygiene in the capital. Since then, the mental hygiene movement has finally embarked on a splendid and bright road. People all over the world have woken up and are tending to develop sound minds. These great achievements are all due to the efforts of Beers alone, which should be forever remembered by us.

In addition to applying scientific methods to improve the treatment of the mentally ill, the goals of the mental hygiene movement are four points: (1) maintaining mental health; (2) preventing mental illness; (3) disseminating accurate knowledge about mental illness; (4) cooperating with various agencies related to mental hygiene. If the mental hygiene movement can be widely promoted to the public, not only will crime be reduced and social order will be stable, but also education, marriage, family, industry and other aspects will benefit greatly from the improvement of individual psychology, so the mental hygiene movement is really the key to the future happiness of mankind.

Since the outbreak of the war, the Chinese Association for Mental Hygiene has virtually come to a standstill. Recently, I heard that many Chinese and foreign psychologists and psychiatrists in this port have organized the Shanghai Mental Hygiene Promotion Association, and are preparing to actively promote mental hygiene. They have also established a mental hygiene children's guidance clinic in the Tongren Hospital on Jiujiang Road, which is presided over by psychiatrist Dr. Han Fen. I heard that they will soon open a mental hospital that truly uses scientific methods to treat mental illness, which is undoubtedly a good news worth reporting to readers. I hope that all sectors will give it enthusiastic sympathy and cooperation.

Education

### True Education

— Mou

I discovered "true education" among twenty-four poorly dressed children. This education made me feel sincerely happy and quietly sigh, "There is still hope!"

I am a second-year university student. Because I am a "university student," I feel the corruption and decline of education even more, because the surrounding atmosphere is so foul that it is hard to believe.

It was a truly accidental opportunity. Two friends started a free night school, and I was also forced to become a teacher. So I became a "teacher" and began to educate. It was truly beyond my expectations that I found the true education that I idealized in these poorly dressed children. Their eyes were wide open.

They listened carefully to me during class, and asked me carefully after class. Their questions often made it impossible for me to answer. However, "teach as an elder, learn as a teacher" became my motto, and I joyfully helped them solve all kinds of difficulties in knowledge. The results of this education are of course very broad, because it is true education and has already reached the efficiency of true education.

However, what about the majority of isolated island students? They live their lives in a drunken stupor, but I believe that "regret" will soon come upon these people, because they have let down "education."

To that group of students who are receiving true education, I bless them: "Success always belongs to you!" But for those confused students, I can only shake my head sadly. I do my best to shout out with a hoarse voice: "Wake up! Seize the opportunity of education!"

### Hitler's Voice

— Fang Ren

Purdue University in the United States studied Hitler's voice during his speeches. It is said that the sound wave vibration frequency of his representative statements reached as many as 228 times per second, which is eight times more than the wave rate of a normal person when angry, so he can make the audience feel hypnotized. However, when a person speaks like this, his emotions are bound to be too agitated to be controlled by consciousness. The school's research concluded that Hitler was nearly suffering from "hysteria" when giving speeches.

### The Higher Demands of Life (Part 1)

The Bible story we discuss today tells of a young man encountering a rare experience in the journey of life. Saul's father sent him to find some lost donkeys. While searching, he felt as though he wouldn't find them. Unexpectedly, he met Samuel, a great prophet and a renowned sage. Samuel was concerned about the welfare of the nation, even more so than Saul was about the lost donkeys. He saw Saul as strong, brave, and talented, exactly the kind of excellent young man he was looking for. He believed Saul was more than capable of assisting the king, so he anointed him as the King of Israel. He also discussed various important national issues with him. When Saul returned home, he reported the results to his uncle. Upon hearing that Saul had met the great prophet Samuel, his uncle earnestly asked his son, "Tell me quickly, what did Samuel say to you?" Saul's reply was quite interesting. He said, "The prophet told me that the lost donkeys have been found." Saul made no mention whatsoever of national affairs. Imagine, a young man is anointed as king, and a famous great sage guides him on the principles of governance, telling him that the fate of the nation rests entirely on him. What does he do? He doesn't mention any of it! This encounter couldn't be more important. He is about to become the king of a nation, yet he only tells his uncle about finding the donkeys. Why doesn't he mention it? Some say that in times of crisis, when people are emotionally tense, conversations often avoid serious topics, focusing on things people usually talk about. Perhaps this is why Saul didn't mention the national issues. Maybe his uncle's words were just casual inquiries, without any real meaning, so Saul kept his affairs secret, or at least didn't say anything for the time being. Or perhaps he wanted to contemplate the matter, study everything he had encountered, and analyze his motivations regarding his future destiny. However, I think it's likely that this wasn't Saul's intention. Looking at what he did after being anointed as king, we know that he seemed to have little interest or concern. He clearly said to himself, "National affairs are uncertain, troublesome, and illusory, and nothing can be achieved. I cannot take on such a responsibility. It's better to use my energy to do practical and certain things, rather than worry about various theories day and night." Therefore, he was content with his current life and happy to look for his donkeys. Why bother worrying about national affairs? (To be continued)

The Arts

### A Machine That Makes People Cry and Laugh

— Lu Degang

An American physicist recently invented a mysterious machine that can emit special radio waves that make people cry or laugh uncontrollably. It is said that a patent has been obtained, and the machine will soon be installed in theaters. During a comedy performance, the machine will emit happy radio waves, and the audience, upon being touched by the waves, will burst into laughter for hours. Conversely, during a tragedy, only sad radio waves need to be emitted, and the audience will weep bitterly, as if mourning their deceased parents, regardless of how ordinary the plot or how clumsy the actors' skills are, the same effect can be achieved.

Therefore, it is predicted that after this machine is released, the attendance at theaters will be unimaginably high, and the machine will also cause an unprecedented commotion in the theater world!

### Casual Chat About Opera

— Huiran

When we casually watch a Peking Opera performance in any theater, we are often moved by the play. Why is this? It is because of the actors' dedication and the excellence of the plot that make people watch with enthusiasm and interest. But the most important thing is to give credit to the actors.

Regarding opera actors, most people believe that having a good voice is enough to perform opera. This is indeed true; to perform opera, one must have the so-called "capital." But is performing opera an easy task? I believe that performing opera is one of the most difficult things because it requires considerable training. If someone has never performed opera before, and you ask them to perform, I believe they will not be able to do it steadily. Let's take the current leading actors as an example; which one of them was not trained from a young age? Even those who started performing opera halfway through their lives need to go through considerable training before they can go on stage. Therefore, to perform opera, in addition to having a good voice, one must also have skilled and beautiful gestures and the perseverance to endure hardship.

For example, if there is a famous amateur performer with a very good voice, and their singing is very pleasant, but their gestures are unsightly, then when they go on stage, they can only sing through the entire piece like a wooden figure, and that's it. Would the audience be willing to watch? They might as well just sing a solo in casual clothes, but opera performers cannot do that.

Writing this reminds me of a charity opera performance in Nanjing one year. One amateur performer, because she had not endured the hardship of waist binding, tied her colored trousers very loosely. When she went on stage to sing her signature "Empty City Stratagem," just as she was reciting, "...the Jieting is difficult to defend," as soon as she turned around, her trousers fell down, causing the audience to burst into laughter. This is also because she had not undergone training. In addition, wearing helmets and other things also requires enduring these hardships (even more so for martial arts performers), otherwise, there would be a risk of fainting on the spot.

In short, "performing opera" is definitely not an easy task. To perform opera, one must endure hardship and consider many aspects in order to become a formal opera performer.

### Deanna Durbin's New Film

### One Generation's Music Saint

— Qihua

Although this film is titled "One Generation's Music Saint," the entire story unfolds with the "Music Saint" Victor Herbert merely as a supporting character. Victor initially allows Louise to perform on stage, and upon learning that Louise is going to marry John, he happily accepts their invitation. And finally, Victor teaches Peggy. If the screenwriter wanted to write "One Generation's Music Saint," then the above are two very important scenes, but now they are completely overshadowed by Mary Martin and Allan Jones' performances. Therefore, "One Generation's Music Saint" is not writing "Victor Herbert's Great Sequel," but a romance resembling "Peach Blossom Hate."

The film unfolds in flashback from Victor Herbert's birthday party, depicting the meeting of Mary Martin and Allan Jones. The director's concise and vivid technique makes the first half of the film very lively and full of musical atmosphere. The second half, after Louise's reputation overshadows John, Louise takes her daughter to Switzerland to live in seclusion, hoping that John can make a comeback; and John suddenly leaves on the night of Louise's performance, and finally helps Peggy to perform. The director's use of the same technique to handle the tragedy inevitably weakens the second half of the film, and the climax is suddenly rushed and not powerful enough.

Walter Connolly is very good as Victor Herbert, but there is no opportunity for him to develop his acting here. Allan Jones and Mary Martin are also better in the first half of the film than in the second half. Susanna Foster is very good at acting as Peggy, and she is a promising actor.

### Thirty Kinds of Storytelling Songs

— Written by Dongxue, Illustrated

Prelude

Storytelling songs are a relatively refined form of "folk literature." "Xihe Lyrics" states: "Stories are compiled into rhyming verses, with both dialogue and tunes, which can be sung and played. At the end of the Song Dynasty, there was the Romance of the Western Chamber, which only composed lyrics and tunes, without any dialogue; until the Jin Dynasty, Dong Jieyuan created the Storytelling Song of the Romance of the Western Chamber, with both dialogue and tunes." It can be seen that storytelling songs have a long history and did not originate with Liu Jingting.

The themes of storytelling songs are generally based on the stories of young men and women's joys, sorrows, separations, and reunions, and are connected by human relationships, social customs, and social changes. Many of the storytelling song scripts are excellent works from the pens of knowledgeable people. Children in Jiangnan all love to listen to them, and it is no accident that they have endured for so long.

This article records twenty kinds of storytelling songs, using the "left picture, right history" format to outline each kind of storytelling song. It will be published every Sunday, completing all twenty weeks.

Storytelling songs occupy a relatively important position in the arts. This article does not dare to aim for articles of the nature of textual research, but can only be said to raise some readers' interest in this kind of "folk literature."
