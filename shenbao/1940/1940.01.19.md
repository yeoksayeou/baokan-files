CHONGQING – A Chinese military spokesperson, during an afternoon reception for reporters today, provided the first detailed account of the fierce battles for Kunlun Pass, north of Nanning, including the four losses and four gains. According to the spokesperson, following the Chinese counter-offensive in Guangxi, Kunlun Pass was initially retaken on December 17th. However, it was lost again on the 19th due to a Japanese counter-attack. The Chinese forces recaptured the pass for the second time the following day, only to be captured again by the Japanese on December 23rd. The Chinese army retook the pass for the third time on December 26th, inflicting heavy casualties on the Japanese. The Japanese launched a final counter-offensive, briefly capturing a portion of the pass, but were completely driven out by the Chinese forces on December 31st. An entire Japanese brigade was annihilated, and it is reported that its commander was also killed in action. Capitalizing on their victory, the Chinese forces recaptured Jiutang, located 30 miles northeast of Nanning, on January 4th. Currently, the Japanese are landing troops at Qinzhou and Fangcheng, and advancing north towards Nanning.

CHONGQING – A Chinese military spokesperson stated today that over the past ten days, Chinese forces in Guangdong have retaken three key points on the periphery of Guangzhou (namely, Juntian, Huaxian, and Conghua), significantly weakening the Japanese position in Guangzhou. Along the Yuehan Railway, the Chinese forces advanced as much as 40 kilometers in just two days, recapturing Juntian, 38 miles north of Guangzhou, on the 14th. Huaxian, 40 kilometers north of Guangzhou, was retaken by the Chinese forces on the 12th. As for Conghua, 55 miles northeast of Guangzhou, it was retaken by the Chinese forces on the 10th. Currently, the only key point shielding Guangzhou that has not yet fallen into Chinese hands is Zengcheng, located 60 kilometers east of Guangzhou. The Japanese 4th Division (including the Konoe Division) has now retreated and concentrated in Guangzhou, preparing to defend the city to the death. In total, the various Chinese forces in northern Guangdong advanced at a very high speed last week, with some advancing as much as 40 kilometers and others advancing as much as 70 kilometers. As for the Japanese forces in Nanning, they have now been reinforced to two divisions, with reinforcements and supplies still being rapidly transported from Qinzhou to Nanning. Due to constant attacks by the Chinese, the Japanese supply convoys are being escorted by large numbers of Japanese troops. Fierce fighting continues in the Kunlun Pass area, with Japanese troops from Taiwan being deployed to the front lines. According to the Chinese spokesperson, the Chinese forces have gained and lost Kunlun Pass four times since last December, but after retaking it again on New Year's Eve, it remains under Chinese control to this day. (Associated Press, 18th)

CHONGQING – Detailed reports received here today regarding the Chinese recapture of Kunlun Pass on December 20th state that although the Japanese used aircraft, artillery bombardment, and machine-gun fire to fiercely resist, the Chinese forces still launched an uphill attack on the pass, breaking through the Japanese defenses and ultimately recapturing this strategic stronghold. The fierce battle was extremely intense and conducted with great deliberation, making it a rare occurrence in the Sino-Japanese War. Two Chinese commanders who led the battle had previously distinguished themselves along the Great Wall, particularly at Gubeikou. The Japanese weapons captured by the Chinese forces in the Kunlun Pass campaign included four field guns, two mountain guns, two direct-fire guns, two light machine guns, thirty-seven heavy machine guns, 1,003 rifles, and 386 hand grenades, along with 102 Japanese prisoners. Two Japanese units, totaling 5,000 to 6,000 officers and soldiers, were reportedly annihilated. Kunlun Pass is located 30 miles northeast of Nanning and serves as the gateway to the city.

### THE CURRENCY PROBLEM IN GUANGZHOU CONTINUES TO WORSEN

GUANGZHOU – The currency problem in Guangzhou is now worsening, the cost of living continues to rise, and the people are suffering greatly. The two-yuan banknotes of the Guangdong Provincial Bank, originally the only currency circulating at face value, were trading at a 50 percent premium over ten-yuan and five-yuan banknotes, but are now worth only fifty cents. Shops and vendors, who previously welcomed one-yuan banknotes, are now unwilling to accept them. As a result, Japanese military scrip has become the currency of Guangzhou. Only the one-dime and two-dime subsidiary coins of the Guangdong Provincial Bank can be used to purchase daily necessities; no other currency is accepted. Although there is a regulation that Guangdong banknotes of any denomination should be exchanged for Japanese military scrip at a rate of 22 yuan to the Japanese yen, rice shops and other businesses only sell rice after the buyer shows the currency they possess. If the buyer holds Japanese military scrip, they can get six pounds of rice per yuan; if they hold a one-yuan banknote from the Provincial Bank, they can only get two pounds; and if they hold a five-yuan banknote from the Provincial Bank, they will get even less – only five pounds.

### A LOYAL ELDERLY SCHOLAR FROM GUSHI: A PAGE OF MARTYRDOM

CHONGQING – A dispatch from Nanyang: Zhang Weizhi, an elderly scholar from Gushi County, Henan Province, who was 70 years old and the chief editor of the Gushi County Gazetteer, devoted himself to the task, collecting information extensively and writing diligently day and night, never complaining of hardship. Throughout his life, he was generous with medicine and charity, resolved disputes, and was particularly enthusiastic about education, a model for the local gentry. In the autumn of the 28th year (1939), the Japanese army attacked Gushi, and almost all the people in the city fled. Relatives and friends repeatedly advised Zhang to seek temporary shelter, but Zhang stubbornly refused. Even when the Japanese army reached the suburbs of the city, his children and grandchildren knelt and begged him to leave the city, but Zhang continued to write in the gazetteer, unmoved. He only ordered his children and grandchildren to flee quickly. The Japanese army soon entered the city and arrived at Zhang's residence. Zhang sat upright in his chair, ignoring all the threats from the Japanese army. The Japanese wanted to appoint Zhang as the chairman of the Gushi County Maintenance Association, but Zhang loudly rebuked them. Nineteen Japanese officers and soldiers, seeing Zhang's stubborn attitude, became angry and stabbed Zhang in the root of his right ear with a sharp blade, the tip of the blade coming out of his left ear. Blood stained his clothes and the ground, but Zhang still rested his right hand on his cheek, closed his eyes as if in a nap. After the Japanese army retreated, relatives and friends returned, calling out to him without response. Seeing the bloodstains, they realized he had died a martyr. They found a paper pellet in the wastebasket, which read six characters: "Why invade our China?" When the people of the whole county heard about it, they all shed tears for him. (18th Dispatch)

Editorial

### AMERICA BEGINS A THOROUGH REVIEW

On New Year's Day this year, this newspaper commented on the global situation, stating that American policy was dawning and that the international agenda for 1940 would begin with American measures towards Japan. As time advances, there is no escape, and now the prelude must unfold. According to yesterday's dispatch from Washington, the United States "Senate Foreign Relations Committee reached a consensus yesterday to review the entire range of U.S.-Japan relations, including the possibility of implementing a ban on the transport of arms and raw materials to Japan after the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty of 1911 expires on January 26. The Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee stated that the committee may ask Secretary of State Hull to discuss the overall situation with the committee on January 31." The results of the review are naturally impossible for anyone to prejudge. However, America's repeated delays and lengthy deliberations regarding the Far East issue and its relationship with Japan reflect a spirit of composure and gradual progress. Those who have failed to understand this American spirit have recklessly hoped that America would either look after its own interests and remain uninvolved, or share in the spoils of war and become an accomplice, leading them to undertake various futile attempts. While America's tolerance of evil may not be intentional, a clear path forward depends on America's clear expression in the future. Whether the review results are positive or negative, clarity is essential.

As the U.S. Senate prepares to review the entirety of U.S.-Japan relations, we would like to offer a few points for consideration: First, after the First World War, the nations of the world, after years of recuperation and education, experienced the re-emergence of divisions and the growth of contradictions, leading to deception, intrigue, and exploitation. Amidst this, there emerged a hidden pillar standing firm in the current, a source of hope for all nations: supporting the weak and resisting aggression. The Soviet Union called for it. Championing freedom, upholding democracy, and striving to maintain human civilization through international justice, the United States became the center. Now, in the face of drastic changes in the world and widespread anxiety, many people are beginning to doubt that all the just arguments of the past were mere deception and that violence is the sole determinant of the future. In the face of such a countercurrent, American leaders bear a solemn responsibility to the world and future generations. Second, the situation of Britain and France is understandable. The arguments they have put forward since the beginning of the war are consistent with China's belief in resistance and align with the general perceptions of the United States. Therefore, they should establish a common understanding and seek consistency in their choices. Discord would negate their efforts. Given China's and Britain and France's dependence on the United States, not only should Britain and France be aligned with China, but at the very least, Britain and France should be aligned with the United States. The American leadership must grasp this essential point. Third, all friendly nations have different priorities in dealing with international issues depending on their circumstances. It is difficult to achieve equal and parallel actions or coordination among all nations. As facts have shown, when the United States vacillates, other countries will act opportunistically for their own benefit. When the United States firmly advocates something, other countries, even if they cannot keep pace with the United States, will strive to follow. If they cannot follow completely, at least they will not go against the United States. The United States bears a great responsibility and should assess its own potential, uphold its great spirit, and move forward directly without unnecessary hesitation. Fourth, morality and law do not always coincide. This is the weakness of modern nations. If they cannot be made to coincide entirely, efforts should be made to increase their congruence. If they not only fail to coincide but are contradictory, it exposes their hypocrisy and absurdity. Peaceful cities are destroyed by artillery fire, and the elderly, women, and children die from bombing, yet upon inspection, 60-70% of the weapons are supplied by the United States. This is the result of legal but immoral commercial behavior in the United States. Law originates from public opinion, and immorality uses law as a shield. How does the American nation explain this? How does the American leadership rectify this? Fifth, some may raise alarms, claiming that if the United States adheres to its national policy and upholds justice, it will provoke a crisis in the Pacific. Where does this crisis lie? A warrior must be arrogant and confident to act recklessly. If they are deeply mired in trouble, with impoverished people and exhausted soldiers, they will only show outward bluster and will not be able to stir up trouble in the Pacific. Conversely, what threat does it pose to the United States if Japan is allowed to accumulate resources and prepare for war in the future?

America's attitude and actions towards the Far East have reached a stage where they must be clearly expressed. In terms of the content of what can be expressed, there will be vastly different angles. We do not know what kind of content the United States will express, but based on the facts and lessons learned since 1931, there are only two possibilities: to punish evil through concrete actions, or, failing to punish evil through concrete actions, to encourage evil, regardless of the explanation, justification, or attribution to any cause. We await and see.

### US Senate to Review US-Japan Relations After Commercial Treaty Expires; Pittman Claims Foreign Relations Committee Will Meet at End of Month; Legislation Restricting Exports to Japan Expected to Pass

Washington – Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman stated today that the Foreign Relations Committee will propose the entire issue of US-Japan relations when it meets on January 31st. At that time, the Committee may request Secretary of State Hull to report on the progress of possible new US-Japan commercial treaty negotiations. The proposal to prohibit exports to Japan and the resolution to invoke the Neutrality Act in the Sino-Japanese War will also be discussed. Senator Gillette, who submitted a resolution yesterday requesting Congress to implement neutrality in the Sino-Japanese War, told reporters today that he expects the Foreign Relations Committee to approve legislation restricting exports to Japan. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)

Washington – Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman recently told the press that regarding the proposal to prohibit certain US goods from being shipped to Japan, he does not intend to bring up the old matter again before the US-Japan commercial treaty expires on the 26th of this month. However, after the treaty expires, he will study the situation at that time to determine whether this proposal is beneficial to the United States before making a decision. (Havas dispatch, 17th)

Washington – The US-Japan commercial treaty is about to expire, but Washington remains calm and is not changing its attitude due to Tokyo's claims that the US stance on trade talks with Japan and other pending issues will force Japan to move closer to Moscow. The public is not very concerned about US-Japan relations, as general attention is now focused on European events and is highly concerned about aid to Finland. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)

Washington – There are currently two types of proposals in the Senate regarding the prohibition of exports to Japan: (1) the draft resolution proposed by Senator Pittman; (2) the draft resolution proposed by Senator Schwellenbach. The purpose of these two proposals is to impose economic sanctions on those who violate treaties to which the US is a signatory, but agricultural products are allowed to be exported. Therefore, although negotiations between Japan and the US regarding a new commercial treaty have been ongoing for several months, it is still difficult to see any progress. (United Press dispatch, 18th)

Washington – According to sources from authoritative circles today, US Secretary of State Hull did not formally respond to Japanese Ambassador to the US Horinouchi's suggestion that the US continue to maintain trade relations with Japan. According to sources, Horinouchi suggested to Hull before the 1st of this month that after the US-Japan commercial treaty expires, the US should provide Japan with a temporary guarantee, that trade between the US and Japan would continue to be treated with reciprocal most-favored-nation status, while negotiating a new commercial treaty during this period. However, Hull did not give a formal response to this. Hull only stated that the key to the issue of guaranteeing and renewing the new commercial treaty lies in future Tokyo talks on the issue of US-Japan relations. Before the Abe cabinet fell, the US side had negotiated with the Japanese side on the issue of American interests in China, such as the interests of Americans in China must be fully protected, and the Japanese army must not interfere with the treaty rights of Americans and their trade rights in China. (United Press dispatch, 18th)

New York – The New York Times, a Democratic newspaper, recently commented on the broadcast speech delivered by Japanese Prime Minister Admiral Yonai yesterday, believing that the content does not show any sign of improving relations with the United States, stating roughly that "Prime Minister Yonai said that Japan's policy towards China for the past three years has been 'unchanging'. If this is true, then even though he is known as 'pro-American,' relations between Japan and the United States may not necessarily improve significantly." (Havas dispatch, 18th)

### US Naval Expansion Aiming to Control Sea Surface in Wartime; Robinson Strongly Advocates Building a Large Number of Destroyers

Washington – Rear Admiral Robinson of the Naval Engineering Bureau testified before the House Naval Affairs Committee today that the United States should have a large number of destroyers in order to control the sea surface in wartime. Robinson defended the destroyer construction program and opposed the criticism from Committee Chairman Vinson that the number of destroyers in the naval expansion plan was too large. It is said that regarding the control of the sea surface, the situation in the United States is quite similar to that in Britain. Once war breaks out, a country similar to Germany must be forced to relinquish control. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)

### Japanese Army Has No Definite Date to Open the Yangtze River; Japanese Navy Spokesman Speaks

Tokyo – A Navy Ministry spokesman told reporters today that the Pearl River will soon be opened to ships of all nations, like the Yangtze River. The spokesman stressed that the Japanese government has no intention of using the Yangtze River issue as a bargaining chip. The date of the Yangtze River's opening has not been decided, but local Japanese authorities are currently rushing to make preparations, such as repairing docks and ships of third countries that were previously requisitioned for military use. Asked which country among the third countries would benefit most from the opening of the Yangtze River, the spokesman replied that judging from past commercial results, Britain would benefit the most, but the United States would naturally also share in the benefits. Asked about the proposed "new central government" of China, the spokesman said that he had heard that the three giants, Wang Jingwei, Wang Kemin, and Liang Hongzhi, would hold a meeting at the end of this month related to the establishment of the "new central government" of China. The spokesman also stated that the military restrictions imposed on the use of Qingdao's port facilities have recently been further relaxed due to changes in military needs. As for the war situation in China, there are no special developments, but the Japanese army is currently carrying out counter-offensives against the Chinese army in various parts of China in winter offensives, in order to permanently defeat the Chinese resistance. At the same time, the Japanese naval air force is paying special attention to the滇越 Railway, in order to cut off the supply route of military equipment entering China via Vietnam. Asked to express technical opinions on the 52,000-ton battleships planned by the US Navy, the spokesman replied that such warships are quite possible to build. The US Navy previously encountered difficulties in building larger warships due to the Panama Canal, but these difficulties can be eliminated. Building such warships will mark a new era in naval armaments, because 25,000-ton battleships combine both offensive and defensive characteristics. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)

### US Economic Sanctions Against Japan Can Guarantee Peace in the Far East; Yen Hui-ching Speaks in the US

New York – Former Chinese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Yen Hui-ching, stated at the "Shanghai Lunch Club" today that Japan is now mocking China's Open Door Policy. It is said that China's door has now become a door only for exit and not for entry. The only way to prevent Japan from closing China's door is to impose economic pressure on Japan. It is said that American trade is indispensable to Japan. The United States only needs to prohibit this trade with Japan, whether in part or in whole, to force Japan to seek peace, withdraw its troops from China, and end its actions that destroy the Nine-Power Treaty. Mr. Yen believes that the weakest point on Japan's ironclad ship is its economic and financial aspect. Therefore, he hopes that the US will impose economic pressure on Japan after the expiration of the US-Japan commercial treaty. Mr. Yen continued, saying that in this war of resistance, the Chinese, who were previously a scattered mess, have formed a strong front. The spirit of unity of the Chinese people is unprecedented since the establishment of the Republic of China. Finally, Mr. Yen stated that from now on, not only will the leadership of the Far East be in the hands of the United States, but the key to world peace is also in the hands of the United States.

### British Parliament Discusses Economic Warfare; Government Representative States that Interests of Neutral Countries Will Be Considered as Much as Possible; Cross Explains the Economic Situation in Britain and Germany

London – The House of Lords held a meeting this afternoon to discuss the issue of economic warfare. Various members raised inquiries, and Lord Hankey, a minister without portfolio, answered on behalf of the government, stating that the British government is willing to consider the interests of neutral countries as much as possible, stating roughly that "various rights of belligerents, or various measures of economic warfare, although sufficient to benefit us, are also sufficient to harm the interests of various neutral countries, we will never implement them." Then, the relations between Germany and the Soviet Union were discussed. Lord Strabolgi, a Labour Party member, argued that Britain should purchase goods that Germany needs most from the Soviet Union to avoid aiding the enemy, but Lord Elibank, a Conservative Party member, strongly opposed this, saying, "Germany and the Soviet Union have now trapped themselves, we do not need to help them out. The resources of the Soviet Union are not as abundant as generally believed." (Havas dispatch, 17th)

London – Minister of Economic Warfare Cross recently delivered a speech in the House of Commons, explaining the meaning of "economy," saying that Germany's general economic life has been in a state of war for many years. Therefore, its economic structure is more rigid and easier to break. If this inference is not wrong, then the evolution of the German economy must be different from the previous World War. We have learned from the lessons of the previous World War and have already prepared... Britain and France share weal and woe and have consistent interests in terms of economic warfare, and maintain close understanding. I am happy to report to you all, and the French authorities are handling various matters with keen eyes and pursuing them with perseverance, which is also what we are eager to take the opportunity to praise. In addition, our economic talks with Belgium, Iceland, Norway, Denmark, and the Netherlands are underway separately. "It is foreseeable that Germany's economic life will be suffocated by us and will eventually be unable to sustain it. If the war is as such, our country's lives can be preserved, and the date of settlement can be advanced." (Havas dispatch, 17th)

London – British Minister of Economic Warfare Cross claimed in the House of Commons yesterday that Germany has suffered huge losses due to the Allied blockade of contraband. It has been four and a half months since the outbreak of the European war, and Germany's economic difficulties are similar to the first two years of the last World War. "The living conditions in Germany are difficult," and Germany no longer has the gold and foreign exchange it had twenty-five years ago. "Germany lacks petroleum, iron, wool, cotton, and other various goods, similar to the beginning of the World War. "We have received information that major German steel factories are about to shut down due to a lack of raw materials." (United Press dispatch, 18th)

### New York Coal Truck Drivers Strike, Taking Advantage of Severe Cold

New York – Today, with temperatures at eleven degrees below zero Celsius, five thousand coal truck drivers in the city went on strike because their employers refused to increase wages, choosing this extremely cold day to protest. Twenty-one coal yards in the city were forced to close, immediately reporting to the authorities and stating that they were unable to fulfill customer orders. In addition, although a small number of coal trucks were still running normally, they were escorted by police to avoid accidents. Municipal authorities believe that unless labor and management quickly reach a compromise, most citizens will definitely freeze overnight tonight. The city's labor bureau has stepped in to mediate, but the results are unknown. (Havas dispatch, 17th)

### Dutch Queen Orders Expansion of Martial Law Area; Helder Naval Port Controls Lights; Germany Adds Defenses on Dutch Border

Amsterdam – The Dutch Queen issued an edict yesterday stipulating that the provinces of Zeeland and South Holland are also included in the area of emergency decrees. Zeeland province includes the islands and peninsulas at the mouths of the Scheldt and Meuse rivers, while South Holland province includes several important cities such as The Hague, the Dutch capital, and the important seaport of Rotterdam. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 18th)

Amsterdam – After the Dutch government adopted preventive measures to expand the area of martial law, the people here saw the government taking a large number of military preparations in South Holland province to prevent coastal attacks, but they did not know the reason for taking these drastic actions, so they were all panicked and uneasy. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 18th)

The Hague – Municipal authorities in the northwestern naval port of Helder have decided to implement a curfew every midnight, at which time all streetlights in the city must be turned off. (Havas dispatch, 17th)

In addition to deciding to flood certain areas, mines and anti-tank obstacles are laid in the military strongholds most vulnerable to attack, trenches are dug, and other fortifications are built. Behind this is a steel-reinforced concrete defense line, defended by the army, which is also equipped with hundreds of artillery pieces, thousands of machine guns, hundreds of thousands of rifles, and countless ammunition. In addition, with strong morale, no enemy should think of occupying or crossing our country's territory within a few days. (Havas dispatch, 17th)

The Hague – The Business Report reports that German military authorities have recently installed large-scale defenses along the Dutch border. First, steel piles are driven into the ground, then a strong steel mesh, two meters high, is laid, and then wire mesh is used to protect it before and after. It is said that the purpose of this move is only to prevent foreign spies and undesirable elements from sneaking into German territory. In fact, this explanation is extremely far-fetched. It is well known that Germany is now actively adding a defense line from Wesel, the end point of the Siegfried Line, to the North Sea. (Havas dispatch, 17th)

London – According to news from Amsterdam and this capital, the German border, which is connected to the Netherlands and Belgium, is now completely frozen, so residents of the two countries no longer worry, even if there are hidden worries, they are very slight.

### Italy's Attitude Toward the European War is Definitely Not Unchanging; New Secretary of the Fascist Party Declares that Italy May Deploy Troops at Any Time

Rome – The new secretary of the Fascist Party, Muti, issued a warning to the provincial Fascist leaders last night that Italy may feel the need to deploy troops at any time, saying that the world should not be complacent and embrace the illusion that Italy's current attitude towards the war will never change. Muti confirmed the Fascist Party's incompatible attitude toward democracy, communism, and bourgeois ideas. Diplomatically, it is believed that Muti's remarks indicate the complete independence of Italian foreign policy. Since the reorganization of the Italian cabinet, British and French newspapers have repeatedly speculated that the Italian government may change its attitude to favor the Allied powers, causing considerable irritation among the Fascist Party. When Muti mentioned this, he said that the changes in the figures in the party and the government should not be regarded as an indication that the path taken by the Fascist revolution will change. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)

### Dutch Cargo Ship Sunk by Germany; Belgian Ship Also Sunk

The Hague – After the Dutch cargo ship "Arendskerk" was sunk by a German submarine, the 59 crew members and two passengers were taken to this place by another cargo ship, the "Polo," and landed here. According to its owner, Mr. Weikel, "When our ship was sailing off Cape Ouessant in France, we suddenly saw a German submarine. Our ship's speed was very high, and we originally intended to ignore it. Later, because we knew that our ship was not carrying contraband and were afraid of being hit by shells, we obeyed the order to stop. The commander of the submarine ordered me to send someone to send the documents for inspection. At that time, he was very respectful, but who knew that after the commander inspected these documents, he said that our ship was carrying contraband to enemy territory, and it was his duty to sink it. Then he ordered everyone to leave the ship within thirty minutes. We then escaped on three lifeboats, and the submarine immediately fired a torpedo at our ship and sank it." The people of the Netherlands are extremely angry about this, and the opinion circles generally believe that Germany's piracy is sufficient to prove the helplessness of its navy. (Havas dispatch, 17th)

### US Ambassador to Belgium Presents Credentials; Reason for Early Arrival is Due to Tense Situation

Brussels – After the US Minister to the Irish Republic, Cudahy, was promoted to Ambassador to Belgium, he arrived here ahead of schedule and paid a visit to King Leopold III to present his credentials. Everyone gave high praise to the ambassador's actions, believing it to be a clear proof of the US concern for the situation in Belgium. The semi-official agency Belgian News Agency also issued news saying that Ambassador Cudahy flew to Belgium from Dublin, Ireland, yesterday and arrived here at 11:00 pm that night. After paying a visit to Foreign Minister Spaak today, he presented his credentials to the King. The ambassador's early arrival was indeed unexpected here. Therefore, officials and diplomatic figures are very concerned about it, believing that the US government's move is to openly express the country's extreme concern for the tense situation in your country. The transfer of the country's former ambassador to Belgium, Davis, to be a close advisor to President Roosevelt is another proof of the country's attention to the situation in Belgium. This situation is really gratifying because of the traditional spirit of amicable relations between the United States and Belgium. (Havas dispatch, 17th)

### French Army Prepares for Imminent Flooding on Far Northern Western Front; British King Inspects Troops in the South; Expeditionary Force Restores Limited Leave

French Front, Though the North Sea Coast is Frozen, the French Army has meticulously planned for imminent flooding in the far north of the Western Front, preparing to execute it immediately upon notification. Within hours, vast swathes of land could be transformed into huge marshes, hindering the advance of enemy troops. The key to this method lies in reversing the usual management of the region's canal network. Normally, sluice gates are closed at high tide and opened at low tide, allowing excess freshwater to flow out. Now, to cause flooding, the sluice gates will be opened at high tide, allowing seawater to inundate the canal banks, and closed at low tide, preventing the water from receding. Initially, special measures will be taken to saturate the land with freshwater, to prevent saltwater from damaging fertile soil. Steps have also been taken to prevent the floodwaters from affecting areas occupied by French forces. (Reuters, 18th)

### Intense Fighting Between Soviet and Finnish Forces Amidst Extreme Cold; Finnish Forces Advance Towards Salla; Soviet Air Force Active on the Front

Helsinki: The Finns continue to fight in the coldest weather seen in thirty-five years, currently defending the Salla front against a new Soviet offensive. Soviet forces are advancing in three directions, aiming to push westward to the Gulf of Bothnia. Fierce fighting is ongoing. According to local sources, two of the offensives have been repulsed, and the Finnish forces are now counterattacking, advancing eastward towards Raunala. They have already recaptured several occupied locations. The Soviets have only achieved some success in the south, where the Finnish forces have now retreated to a new defensive line at Viitavala. Finnish scouting reports indicate that the Soviet forces are withdrawing their heavy artillery, likely due to the material losses suffered in the battle for Suomussalmi, and are taking precautions. It is reported that the Finnish forces on the eastern front have achieved a major victory near Kitella, north of Lake Ladoga. After three days of intense fighting, the Soviet forces suddenly abandoned several artillery pieces and twenty-nine light tanks, retreating due to apparent supply issues. The Finnish strategy in the Karelian Isthmus, in addition to using deep trenches and fortifications to resist the Soviets, also involves frequent surprise attacks on the Soviet rear and flanks to disrupt their morale. The Finnish forces seem to disregard the concentration of Soviet troops and tanks, which observers find astonishing. There are frequent instances of a single Finn destroying a tank. Sometimes, a Finnish soldier will jump onto a light tank, smash its machine gun with a heavy club, and then calmly capture or destroy the tank. (Reuters, 18th)

Helsinki: The Finnish General Headquarters announced last night that there had been contact in the Garilin Isthmus yesterday. Fierce fighting also occurred northwest of Ladoga, resulting in the destruction of two Soviet armored vehicles and the capture of one hundred rifles. One hundred Russian soldiers were killed. Finnish forces also made successful progress in the Salla sector. Apart from the Garilin Isthmus, there was no significant activity by the Soviet air force. The Finnish air force also conducted bombing raids on enemy centers and several positions, shooting down one Soviet aircraft. (Haitong Agency, 18th)

Moscow: The Leningrad Military District Headquarters issued a communiqué stating that the Soviet Air Force conducted reconnaissance flights over various parts of Finland yesterday and bombed railway junctions and military targets. Eleven enemy aircraft were shot down. On the same day, reconnaissance teams were active in all sectors, and there was light artillery fire. (TASS, 18th)

Helsinki: A Finnish spokesperson told a Reuters reporter last night that in recent days, as many as three to four hundred Soviet bombers fly over Finland daily. Finland can only effectively defend against these attacks with about half of its aircraft, i.e., around one hundred and fifty. This number includes training aircraft and aircraft from foreign countries. (Reuters, 18th)

Stockholm: It is reported that Finland currently has ten thousand Swedish volunteers who have been trained to operate in icy conditions and will soon join the front lines as a full unit. (Reuters, 18th)

Helsinki: Several Soviet aircraft flew over the port of Turku (an industrial center) in southwestern Finland and the city of Lappeenranta in the southern Karelian Isthmus yesterday, dropping bombs. Several houses were hit and caught fire. (Havas, 18th)

Helsinki's Excellent Blackout

Helsinki: Finland has been experiencing extreme cold weather in recent days. Temperatures on the northern Salla-Tsamo Line have dropped to sixty degrees Celsius below zero. Even in southern areas, temperatures are between forty-five and fifty degrees Celsius below zero. According to reports last night, the Soviet Air Force's main bombing target yesterday was Vyborg. The city's largest hotel has been heavily damaged. The remaining residents, suffering from the extreme cold and frequent bombings, are in a state of distress. The city authorities have sent a telegram to Helsinki requesting assistance. The city of Helsinki is relatively quiet, as there have been no air raid alerts for the past two days. Residents, both men and women, are wearing thick fur coats and boots, resembling members of an Arctic exploration team. Cars and carriages in the city have camouflage equipment to avoid being targeted in air raids. After 4 p.m., the entire city turns into a dark area. The discipline of the people in observing the blackout is exceptional. British and German citizens who have recently arrived from Britain and Germany have unanimously praised Helsinki's blackout measures, saying they are superior to those in Berlin and London. (Haitong Agency, 18th)

Soviet Union Denies German and British Reports

Moscow: Recent German and British reports about the Soviet-Finnish war do not conform to the facts. The Leningrad Military District Headquarters has denied them and issued the following statement: "The British Daily Express claims that our air force has caused extensive damage to labor settlements in Helsinki. This report is completely untrue. The Soviet Air Force has not bombed Helsinki, and even less so has it bombed labor areas within Helsinki." Also, the German Haitong Agency claims that the frozen corpse of General Vinogradov, commander of the Soviet 44th Division, has been discovered by Finnish forces in the Suomussalmi area. This report is also untrue. General Vinogradov is still alive and continues to work in the 44th Division's operational area. (TASS, 18th)

Moscow: This place has recently received the German "Frankfurter Zeitung" of December, which stated that the return of Petsamo was part of the most important demands made by the Soviet Union to Finland. The newspaper also said that Molotov had discussed this demand in a speech on October 31. TASS is now authorized to declare that the Soviet government has never demanded that Finland return Petsamo to the Soviet Union. Molotov has never mentioned this point in any speech, including on October 31. The "Frankfurter Zeitung" report is clearly a fabricated report. (TASS, 18th)

### Swedish Prime Minister Declares Firm Support for Finland; Will Control Communist Activities with All Strength; Former Foreign Minister Sandler Explains Reasons for Resignation

Stockholm: The Parliament met yesterday to discuss foreign policy. Prime Minister Hansson delivered an important speech, concluding that "We must work together to address our national issues and assist our neighbor, Finland." (All members cheered.) He added that the government would use all its strength to control the activities of the Communist Party and would not hesitate to take strict measures if necessary. In addition, former Foreign Minister Sandler also gave a speech explaining the reasons for his resignation. He said that the safety of the Åland Islands (located in the Gulf of Bothnia, between Sweden and Finland) is related to the safety of Sweden. Our country should maintain it with its own strength. My previous Nordic policy assumed that the Soviet Union was a peaceful factor. Since the Soviet Union attacked Finland, this policy has been abandoned. For now, our country should earnestly assist Finland. This is the best way to maintain our independence and neutrality and avoid being drawn into the vortex of war. The current Foreign Minister Gunder then spoke, saying that helping Finland is the unanimous wish of the people of our country. The government's current policy is based on the fundamental principle that Sweden and Finland are closely linked. However, we must also consider that our country is neutral in the war between major powers. At this moment, the international environment is extremely tense, and it may intensify in the future. With the Western Front currently in a stalemate, the war zone may expand to the territories of various neutral countries. The government must avoid any measures that could be seen as violating neutrality. Therefore, although the government wants to do more to help Finland, it cannot do everything it wants. The United States has expressed sympathy and provided assistance to Finland, which our country greatly admires. The attitude of the American nation towards a peace-loving neutral country being invaded is a great support to the Swedish nation. In short, the government's current policy has been approved by the Parliament, which is gratifying. Leaders of various political parties subsequently spoke, all agreeing with the current policy, and they also agreed with the resolution to assist Finland, maintain neutrality, and strengthen national defense. (Havas, 18th)

### Japanese Military Dissatisfied with Yonai; Military Newspaper Kokumin Shimbun Denounces New Cabinet as Puppet Cabinet; Yonai Cabinet is Masterpiece of Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal Yuasa

Tokyo: After the resignation of the Abe Cabinet, the most talked-about successor was General Shunroku Hata, the Army Minister. However, former Navy Minister Admiral Mitsumasa Yonai suddenly received the order to form a cabinet, completely unexpectedly. According to those familiar with the inside story, this was the masterpiece of Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal Yuasa. On the 12th of this month, when the Abe Cabinet decided to resign but had not yet made it public, Privy Councilor Fumimaro Konoe and Army Minister Hata both had the possibility of succeeding as Prime Minister, but they held different opinions. Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal Yuasa, because Admiral Yonai was a soldier with moderate views and was respected by the people, decided to ask him to form a cabinet based on these three strengths. He secretly informed him of this intention and instructed him to prepare in advance. Privy Councilor Konoe learned of this and immediately worked for Admiral Yonai at the Tokyo Club on the afternoon of the 13th. That evening, General Hata visited the club and persuaded him to accept the formation of the cabinet. At that time, Konoe's attitude was quite cold, saying that he felt that he was not good at economic and financial issues and should not take office as Prime Minister at this time, and advised General Hata to consider running himself. At the same time, Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal Yuasa came up with a clever plan, causing the newspapers to speculate about the possibility of General Hata or General Araki forming a cabinet, and allowed the Army Headquarters to hold a meeting on the 14th to discuss the issue of General Hata forming a cabinet. For this reason, the newspapers used large headlines to publish the news that General Hata had the best chance of forming a cabinet. However, on the other hand, the results of Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal Yuasa's negotiations were very good. Former Foreign Minister Arita and former Finance Minister Ishiwata were willing to do their best to help Admiral Yonai, and they could accept any cabinet position. Therefore, the news that Admiral Yonai had been ordered to form a cabinet was suddenly announced on the afternoon of the 14th, which greatly surprised people from all walks of life, and the military was shocked. By the evening of that day, General Hata was summoned to the palace. Subsequently, it was officially announced that the Emperor would meet with him, saying that the Army should fully assist Admiral Yonai. Everyone paid close attention to this. According to informed sources, this move was for two reasons: (1) to avoid the military developing a negative impression of Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal Yuasa's methods; (2) to prevent rumors from the Army opposing Admiral Yonai from recurring. Regarding this, Admiral Yonai had previously denied it in response to inquiries in the House of Representatives on February 8, 1939, when he was the Navy Minister in the Hiranuma Cabinet, saying that the views of the Navy and Army were completely consistent. However, there must be a reason for the rumor. The Navy, especially Admiral Yonai, had vehemently opposed the idea of Japan concluding a treaty of alliance with Germany and Italy, which was contrary to the Army's position. Some people even compared this alliance idea to a ship, saying that Admiral Yonai torpedoed it, and then German Chancellor Hitler formed an agreement with the Soviet Union and scuttled the ship himself. Therefore, it is not unfounded to say that the Japanese Army opposed Admiral Yonai. As for General Hata, he upheld the Army's inherent discipline, obeyed the Emperor's order, and immediately agreed to continue serving as Army Minister in the Yonai Cabinet. This is the process of forming the Yonai Cabinet. In the view of general public opinion in Japan, the most obvious stage of this matter is the article published by the military newspaper Kokumin Shimbun on January 15. The article stated, "Most people are very unhappy about Admiral Yonai forming a cabinet. When he was the Navy Minister in the Hiranuma Cabinet, he opposed the alliance between Japan, Germany, and Italy, causing the proposal to fail. Since then, people in the Imperial Presence have regarded him as a candidate to succeed as Prime Minister. Now that he has come out to form a cabinet, those who advocate innovation say that it is a reward for breaking the Japan-Germany-Italy triangular alliance. However, in reality, what is formed will inevitably be a puppet cabinet that serves the people in the Imperial Presence. The various shortcomings of the previous cabinet may not be remedied, and its lifespan will inevitably be short. Admiral Yonai does not have a strong personality and cannot enhance the current form of national unity. Recommending him to the Emperor and ordering him to form a cabinet is a conspiracy by people in the Imperial Presence and a great disaster." (Havas, 17th)

Tokyo: The Japanese Provisional Cabinet meeting was held at the Prime Minister's official residence at 10:30 this morning. First, opinions were exchanged among the cabinet members on the issue of the retention or removal of parliamentary vice-ministers. As a result, (1) parliamentary vice-ministers will be retained, (2) all current parliamentary vice-ministers will be replaced, and (3) the allocation of factions and the selection of candidates will be decided by the Prime Minister, but the candidates will be selected based on their abilities and suitability. (Domei, 18th)

### Japan's New Minister of Agriculture Consults on Rice Issues

Tokyo: A semi-official Japanese source states that the new Minister of Agriculture, Shimada, met with journalists at his official residence yesterday. He emphasized that Japan does not genuinely lack rice. The high price of rice in various consumption centers is entirely due to control issues. He feels deeply about the importance of his responsibilities. However, he must point out that Japan is not currently suffering from a genuine rice shortage. In fact, he believes that Japan currently has a sufficient quantity. The estimated rice harvest in Japan this year is 66,000,000 koku (approximately 360,000,000 bushels). However, to his knowledge, the actual number is much higher than this. In addition, the annual import of foreign rice, the reduction of rice for sake brewing, and the general economy of public consumption can also save 4,000,000 koku. (Reuters, 18th)

### Australia Revises Customs Regulations

Canberra, Australia: The Australian Federal Government has recently announced important revisions to the Customs Import License Regulations promulgated on December 1 of last year. These revisions are related to the shipment of goods from non-sterling countries and to confirmed orders.

### Chamberlain's Ambiguous Attitude Towards Japan; Answers Questions from Various Members of Parliament in the House of Commons Regarding the Current Situation in China

London: During the House of Commons meeting today, Liberal Party Member of Parliament Mander asked Prime Minister Chamberlain if he had any news reports regarding the situation in China. The Prime Minister immediately replied, "The Japanese Foreign Minister Gu Zhengzhi notified the British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, on December 18 of last year that his government has decided to open the lower reaches of the Yangtze River from Nanjing eastward, subject to certain restrictions necessary to maintain security and conduct military operations. The Japanese government also hopes to do the same for the Pearl River. This decision, which will gradually restore equal opportunities for all countries in commerce, is welcomed by the British government." Mander further asked if the Prime Minister could clearly state that Britain would not support the "new government" led by Wang Jingwei.

### Record of the Fierce Battle at Kunlun Pass: Chinese Troops Reclaimed It Three Times in Ten Days; The Two Most Valiant Regiments of the Japanese Army Were Completely Annihilated; The Glorious History of a Thousand Years Ago Was Re-enacted

Guilin Dispatch: Looking at a 1/50,000 scale map, Kunlun Pass is about two "sheng ding" in area, a rectangular location with high mountains, steep ridges, and dense forests. After the Guangxi-Guangdong Campaign began, the Japanese army, attacking head-on, penetrated Kunlun Pass, using the high mountains as a screen and the forests as cover. It was quite difficult for the Chinese troops, seeking opportunities to attack, to discover the enemy's targets here.

The Chinese troops mainly responsible for attacking Kunlun Pass were the Zheng Division of the X Army. This division was composed of officers and soldiers recovered from injuries, rich in combat experience, with unwavering morale from top to bottom, and had undergone eight months of training. Their excellent quality was beyond question. On December 17th, the division received orders to depart from Silong and cautiously advance towards Kunlun Pass. At 5:00 AM on the 18th, treading under sparse morning stars, they launched a frontal assault, first with long-range artillery, followed by infantry climbing upwards. The Japanese army, holding Kunlun Pass, was the notoriously stubborn 5th Division, exceptionally cunning. When the Chinese troops launched a fierce attack, the Japanese army relied on strong fortifications, hiding in hillside caves, waiting for the Chinese troops to approach the closest distance, and then used a crossfire network for stubborn defense. It was quite difficult to capture it in one fell swoop. However, after a period of rest, the Chinese troops continued their fierce attack, and finally, with a very small force of two companies, captured the mountain peak and the important roads there. This was the glorious first recapture of Kunlun Pass by the Chinese troops.

However, not long after, because the remaining Japanese troops on the flanks were not completely eliminated, and the follow-up troops had not arrived, the Japanese army took advantage of the situation and attacked again. The officers and soldiers of the two companies who first captured Kunlun Pass heroically sacrificed themselves. Their blood added infinite glory to the battle of Kunlun Pass.

On the 19th, the Chinese military deployment used the latest tactics, surrounding and fiercely fighting for an entire day, contesting for Height 653, killing over 300 Japanese soldiers, capturing eight light and heavy machine guns, and over 100 rifles. By evening, they finally retook the height. On the 20th and 21st, they launched another fierce offensive, capturing Fairy Mountain, Lao Mao Ridge, Kuqiu Ridge, etc. By this time, all important strongholds east and west of Kunlun Pass were completely under the control of the Chinese troops. The Japanese army suffered heavy casualties, with corpses strewn everywhere. The Chinese troops captured a large number of firearms and pursued the victory. On the evening of the 24th, they recaptured Luo Tang Fortress, and the Japanese army's screen of communications was completely lost. At this moment, a reward of 15,000 yuan from the Chinese military high command was sent to the division, and the soldiers were extremely excited. As a result, the remaining Japanese troops in the remaining passes were annihilated by the Chinese troops in one fell swoop. What was most interesting was that the Japanese army dispatched a large number of aircraft to deliver bullets, milk, biscuits, cigarettes, etc., which all fell into the Chinese troops' positions and were obtained by the Chinese soldiers, who accepted them without thanks, further increasing their excitement. In particular, when the Japanese army used aircraft to send reinforcements, each aircraft dropped soldiers with parachutes, from as few as five to as many as ten. The Chinese soldiers raised their guns high, like shooting flying birds, one shot per soldier, with perfect accuracy. Everyone was overjoyed. Although they had not slept for seven or eight days, their appetite increased instead, and their spirits were further invigorated. This kind of spirit was enough to guarantee the determination to win that every officer and soldier possessed.

By the morning of the 26th, after two hours of hand-to-hand combat, Kunlun Pass was recaptured again in one fell swoop. The 21st and 22nd Regiments of the 5th Division, known as the "Iron Army" by the Japanese, and the forces scattered near Kunlun Pass, were completely annihilated by the Chinese troops, and more than 50 light and heavy machine guns, over 100 rifles, countless horses and supplies, and a large number of important documents were captured. In the diaries of Japanese officers and soldiers, there were nineteen entries filled with anti-war sentiments, and they recorded the fact that the Chinese troops were becoming more and more courageous in battle. One captain wrote about the battle of Kunlun Pass, saying, "This time the enemy is stubborn, which was really unexpected." It can be seen that the Japanese army's estimation of the Chinese troops was something they did not expect.

For two days, the 27th and 28th, the battle of Kunlun Pass came to a temporary halt. Then, because the Japanese troops in the Jieshou area had not yet been eliminated, the Chinese troops' position at Kunlun Pass was in serious danger of falling into the hands of the Japanese army again. From the perspective of reorganizing the strategic situation, the Chinese high command ordered the division to temporarily leave Kunlun Pass and advance towards Jieshou. On the evening of the 29th, they engaged in a fierce battle with the Japanese troops in Jieshou. The next morning, they finally eliminated all the Japanese troops in that area. After the division completed its mission in Jieshou, it attacked Kunlun Pass again, and the mountain peaks were stained with blood. They finally recaptured Kunlun Pass for the third time in the morning of the 31st with a day and night of effort, and the remaining Japanese troops near Kunlun Pass were also completely eliminated. By this time, the bloody battle of Kunlun Pass had come to a complete end. From now on, the Guangxi-Guangdong war situation will undoubtedly unfold a more glorious future with the complete recapture of Kunlun Pass. Looking back to a Lantern Festival day a thousand years ago, General Di Qing of the Song Dynasty crossed Kunlun Pass at night and defeated Nong Zhigao, writing a glorious page of history. Today, a thousand years later, on the eve of New Year's Day in the 29th year of the Republic of China, the generals and soldiers of China's war of resistance against Japan have re-enacted this glorious page of history under people's earnest expectations, which has even more special significance. Because Di Qing put down a domestic rebellion back then, and today's generals and soldiers are resisting foreign aggression. Moreover, the number of enemies eliminated is large, and the value of recapturing Kunlun Pass is a hundred times greater than crossing Kunlun Pass at night back then.

### Chinese Troops in Northern Jiangsu Launch an Offensive Towards Rugao; Japanese and Puppet Troops Suffer Casualties

Northern Jiangsu Dispatch: The Chinese troops of the counter-offensive like a rising tide ××× unit, gathered two regiments overnight and launched a full-scale attack on the Japanese army in the county seat, various strongholds, and Dongchen Town on the morning of the 9th. Chinese Army ××× Brigade Commander personally stationed at Chongshan Nunnery near Rugao County to command the battle. At 7:00 AM on that day, the various units had separately begun their attacks according to orders. The Chinese Army × National Second Battalion immediately occupied Dongchen Town and was fighting fiercely with the remaining Japanese troops. The attacking troops also pressed into the northeast gates of the county seat, bravely advancing. It is also reported that the Chinese troops attacking Rugao County were engaged in fierce battles with the Japanese army in the suburbs. The First Battalion of the × Regiment, which attacked the east gate, had defeated the Japanese army at the power plant outside the city and occupied the city wall. The × Battalion of the × Regiment, which attacked the north gate, had completely captured the Japanese stronghold outside the north gate and continued to advance. At the same time, the Chinese troops who occupied Dongchen were clearing out the remaining enemies. The Japanese army, with its line wavering, was still trying to struggle and had asked for help from all sides. The fighting was fierce, and casualties on both sides were extremely heavy.

On the evening of the 3rd of this month, the Chinese Army ×× unit sent a ×× Battalion Commander, leading his subordinates, to assist the ×× Regiment in covering an attack on Jinjiaji in Tianchang. They encountered a puppet pacification force near Guandian Town, killing many Japanese and puppet troops and capturing three Japanese soldiers, four rifles, and one Japanese and one puppet flag. The Chinese troops continued to attack Tianchang. A Japanese military police captain was killed by a Chinese mortar shell, and more than twenty Japanese and puppet troops were injured.

Chairman Chiang recently telegraphed Commander-in-Chief Yu, and Deputy Commanders-in-Chief Shen and Han of the Shandong-Jiangsu War Zone, to commend the guerrilla units on various Chinese army lines for their bravery and decisiveness. The text read: "The guerrilla combat of the various units has resulted in many captures, which shows that the command is effective and the officers and soldiers are doing their duty. The unit under Wen Dongduo has sabotaged the enemy's transportation in the southern section of Jinpu, which is deeply gratifying."

### The Japanese Army Spies and Invades Nantian, Repeatedly Attempts to Land Unsuccessfully; The Defending Troops Resist and Fierce Fighting Occurs; The Japanese Side Suffers More Than Twenty Casualties

Nantian Dispatch: This county is located in Sanmen Bay, formed by islands, and its situation is isolated. Since the start of the war of resistance, Japanese warships have harassed several islands with sparse residents, such as Hu'ao Mountain, Beihai Mountain, and NanYu Mountain, which is uninhabited. Unexpectedly, at 2:00 PM on the 19th of last month, a Japanese destroyer of the "Kuri" class docked off Hu'ao Mountain (also known as Dafotou Mountain), and lowered a motorboat carrying more than a dozen naval marines in black serge uniforms. They sailed along Dafotou Port towards the Jinjiaoyi coast of Longquan Town in the county, sounding the depth of the coastal waters, seemingly attempting to land. The guards in the bunkers in the area immediately opened fire. The Japanese boat also returned fire, and a fierce battle lasted for an hour. The Japanese soldiers were unsuccessful and retreated towards Qingshui'ao. The county government received the above report and anticipated that the Japanese would definitely gather a crowd and attack again, so that evening, it ordered Huang Daogang, the leader of the county self-defense team, to lead his troops to Longquan to supervise and strictly guard the garrison. At dawn the next morning, three small Japanese motorboats came to Xiaodao Yan Hill, docked on the shore, and tried to land again. The self-defense team immediately opened fire with dense shots. The Japanese soldiers also returned fire, and a battle began. After an hour, the Japanese soldiers, seeing the strict precautions, fled elsewhere and changed to landing at Pajiao'ao in the southeast corner of the foot of Xiaowu Yan Hill. The self-defense team also changed to guarding important strongholds, resisting fiercely from a high position. The Japanese soldiers were unable to land and fled back to the motorboats, sailing to Dafotou. At this time, the Japanese warship anchored at Qingshui'ao also sailed to the Jinjiaoyi sea area and fired shells at Zhonggang, Xiaoyantou, and the bunkers. At the same time, two Japanese boats, under the cover of artillery fire, landed on Niaogui Mountain in the Yehushan sea area and engaged in a fierce battle with the local garrison in the Jinjiaoyi Tang and WuYan Hill areas. Around 11:00 AM, the Japanese soldiers were reinforced again, and ventured to disturb in three routes. The first route went from Bahuajing to Gaotang (that is, Longquan Town), and the second and third routes went along the pond bank to the foot of the Zhonggang bunker, searching for civilian homes and hunting for property. Those who caught chickens and robbed cigarettes were the most numerous, so chickens and dogs fled, and the order was greatly disrupted. By 2:30 PM, the garrison reinforcements arrived, and the Japanese soldiers did not dare to stay for long, so they fled to Jinjiaoyi and returned to their warships. In total, in the two-day battle, the Japanese side suffered more than twenty casualties, and the corpses were dragged back. The Chinese side killed three soldiers: Feng Quanfa, Mo Xiaonong, and Liu Dexing; one guard team member, Wang Yunxiang; and one civilian, Shi Xiaobao, who died from a bullet wound. Afterwards, the county government immediately sent personnel to set off in groups to comfort the local people, investigate the public and private losses, and inquire about the war of resistance.

### Shanghai-Hong Kong Interport Football Match Officially Announced; Shanghai Team to Hold Trial Match Next Week; Hong Kong Team to Play Three Matches in Shanghai

The Shanghai-Hong Kong interport football match has been suspended for two years. This year's preparations for resumption were initiated by the local Westerners' Association sending a letter inviting the Hong Kong team to come north during the Spring Festival. As news spread, the Hong Kong team's roster has been decided, and the Hong Kong side's official reply has also arrived. The Westerners' Association convened an executive committee meeting at its office at 5:15 PM yesterday (Wednesday), where it was decided on the schedule for the Hong Kong team's matches in Shanghai, totaling three games. The Shanghai team's representatives will be selected later, and a trial match will be held next week. Tickets will go on sale within days, with reserved seats priced at 2.20 yuan and 1.10 yuan, and general admission at 0.63 yuan. Pre-sale will begin soon at the Shiping Foreign Firm. The interport match schedule is officially announced as follows:

Note that this schedule differs slightly from the past, as in previous years, one of the visiting team's three matches was against the military.

Trial Match Next Week: The Shanghai interport team's trial match will be held at the end of next week, likely on Sunday (the 28th) morning, at the Yiyuan Stadium. The opposing teams will be the Ideal and Possible teams selected by the association. The selection committee will meet early next week to decide the rosters of the two teams. This year's Shanghai team has abundant talent, so only one trial match will be held. The rosters of the Hualian and Xilian teams will be announced as soon as they are decided.

Hong Kong Team's Travel Dates: The Hong Kong team's travel dates have not yet been reported. It is likely that they will depart on the 4th of next month, arrive in Shanghai on the 6th, and hold the interport match on the 8th. The Hong Kong team roster this year is clearly not the elite of the entire island. Most unfortunately, the Chinese players cannot make the trip, and losing the star player Li Huitang means that the Shanghai team has a good chance of winning all three matches.

### U.S. Ambassador Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning - Scheduled to Take a Ship to Hankou Next Monday - Unwilling to Comment on Political Issues

U.S. Ambassador to China, Dr. Johnson, arrived in Shanghai on the U.S. transport ship Henderson yesterday morning at 7:00 AM, at the crack of dawn. After the ship docked at the naval pontoon on the Bund, the Ambassador, accompanied by welcoming staff from the embassy, drove to the Cathay Hotel to rest. The Ambassador met with the U.S. Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Gauss, and the Japanese Special Envoy to Shanghai, Mr. Kato, at 10:00 AM.

Accompanying Personnel

Those accompanying him included his private secretary, Mr. Larrow, Military Attaché Major Meyer, and Naval Attaché Offredson. The Henderson also brought fifty Marines belonging to the Embassy Guard in Peiping from Qinhuangdao, who had completed their tour of duty in the Orient. They have served at the Embassy for nearly two years and six months. This time they escorted the Ambassador on his return to the United States. The ship will remain in Shanghai until the 28th of this month, and then take 190 U.S. Fourth Marine Regiment soldiers who have completed their tour of duty, via the Pacific Ocean to Los Angeles.

Departure to Hankou

The Ambassador will remain in Shanghai for four days, during which he plans to meet with Consul General Gauss, and then, together with Rear Admiral Graff, Commander of the U.S. Yangtze River Patrol, will take the Luzon up the Yangtze River, via Nanjing, Yanhu, and Jiujiang, to Hankou. The Ambassador's trip is to inspect the situation along the Yangtze River, which has considerable political and diplomatic significance. After arriving in Hankou on the 29th of this month, he will meet with the U.S. Consul General there and listen to reports on American expatriates and business.

Departure to Chongqing Next Month

He will then return to Shanghai on the Luzon, escorted by the U.S. Navy ship Guam. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai on February 6th. Since Chongqing is eagerly awaiting his return to his post, the Ambassador will not stay in Shanghai for long after inspecting the Yangtze River. He will take a boat to Hong Kong in early February and then take a China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) flight to Chongqing. It is widely believed that after the Ambassador arrives in Chongqing, China's future will have a brighter development, which is highly valued.

Ambassador's Remarks

The English-language North China Daily Mail reported that U.S. Ambassador to China, Johnson, arrived in Shanghai this morning (the 18th) on the U.S. transport ship Henderson. According to his remarks to reporters, this trip to Shanghai and his upcoming trip to Hankou and then back to Chongqing have no special significance. It is merely a routine matter for the Ambassador. As for whether this trip is related to the imminent restoration of peace in China and the complete opening of the Yangtze River, it is not necessary to mention it, because there is not much concern about these matters at present.

Mentioning Peiping

When reporters asked about his time in Peiping, the Ambassador smiled and replied that he was too busy reuniting with his family to have enough time to tour the city. His two children are now at an age where they need closer attention from their parents.

Kato's Visit

The Ambassador met with the U.S. Minister to Australia, Mr. Gauss, the former Consul General in Shanghai, for about half an hour at 10:00 AM. The Japanese Special Envoy to China, Kato Gaishi, also visited Ambassador Johnson at the U.S. Consulate around 11:00 AM, leaving about twenty minutes later.

North of the Suzhou Creek

After arriving in Shanghai, he has accepted an invitation to go to Hankou with Rear Admiral Glassford on Monday. He will return to Shanghai in early February and then immediately go to Chongqing via Hong Kong. When reporters inquired about the possibility of returning the area north of the Suzhou Creek in the International Settlement to the Shanghai Municipal Council, the Ambassador replied that he was not concerned about this at present. When reporters asked about the antiquities in Peiping, the Ambassador smiled and replied that he has not been interested in these antiquities since coming to China thirty-two years ago.

As for the passengers of the ship, they changed to smaller vessels and landed at the Customs Wharf around 9:30 AM.

Fair Price Rice Conference

The Shanghai Fair Price Rice Committee is actively carrying out fair price sales. It is scheduled to start operations in fifty districts on the 21st of this month (Sunday). The committee held its third plenary committee meeting at the Shipping Club on Guangdong Road at 3:00 PM yesterday. Those present included Yu Qiaqing, Xu Jiying, Ma Jiliang, Chen Panjun, Shen Ruizhou, Xu Yongzuo, Chen Chuxiang, Shao Baoxing, Ge Weian, Chen Ziyi, Cao Xingeng, Zhang Lunqing, Zhang Jiguang, Fu Qiangeng, Zhang Nianxuan, Chen Weiguang, Huang Yuzhai, Pei Yunqing, Fu Qilin, Xu Wenzhao, Yang Weiyin, Lu Wenshao, Wang Yuqing, Fan Guifu, Zhu Yinjiang, Cheng Kefan, Shen Weiting, Zhu Binglu, Zhang Qingmao, Chen Cuifang, Feng Qingan, Wang Pinzao, Ni Bozai, Zhou Jingzhai, Xia Xianting, Pan Yangyao, Ding Fangyuan, and others, totaling more than fifty people. The chairman was Yu Qiaqing, and the recorder was Yang Youlong. First, the chairman reported on the rice purchase situation and the procedures for fair price sales. It was decided that operations would start on the 21st of this month and continue to solicit donations. Immediately afterwards, they began to discuss the methods proposed by the Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry, Rice Shop Industry, and Miscellaneous Grains and Oilcake Industry, and a resolution was passed. As for the 1,500 tons of tribute rice set by the committee, it is expected to arrive in Shanghai soon.

Fair Price Rice Donations

The various trade associations are now very enthusiastic about donating to support fair price rice sales. Those who continue to pledge donations include the Oil Pressing Factory Industry (3,000 yuan), Customs Brokerage Industry (5,000 yuan), Wine and Teahouse Industry (10,000 yuan), Jewelry Industry (5,000 yuan), Shipping Industry (10,000 yuan), Thermos Bottle Manufacturing Industry (1,000 yuan), Ginseng Shop Industry (5,000 yuan), Hotel Industry (10,000 yuan), Tung Oil and Ramie Industry (5 yuan), Metal Parts Industry (535 yuan per month for six months), Ma Shaoquan (1,000 yuan), Zhu Jingan (5,000 yuan), Huang Yuzhai (50 yuan), totaling more than 62,000 yuan. As for the various industries that have not yet pledged donations, such as the Sauce Garden Industry, Silver Shop Industry, Seafood and Grocery Industry, Charcoal Industry, Machine-Made Coal Briquette Industry, and Mineral Ash Factory Industry, their trade associations are extremely supportive of fair price rice donations. They believe that the only way to suppress rice prices is to implement fair price sales and group rice purchases. The above-mentioned trade associations will all convene temporary committee meetings within days to strongly encourage member businesses to donate to fair price rice sales. It is also hoped that the Food Regulation Association will intensify its work and urge various factories and shops to participate in group rice purchases. If this is the case, the grain reserves will increase even more.

Relief Buns

Since the Group Federation began distributing wheat flour buns along Dagu Road every evening starting on the 9th of this month, the number of people awaiting relief has increased rapidly every day. When relief was first distributed, there were only four hundred impoverished people gathered awaiting relief. By the evening before last, this number had increased to more than four thousand. The 16,000 or so buns prepared at that time were all distributed. Therefore, the federation observed that the rapidly increasing number of people in need of relief means that funding will be difficult to sustain in the future. It is hoped that philanthropists will continue to provide relief funds to avoid disruption. In addition, when the federation distributes relief buns every evening, in terms of order, in addition to setting up ropes and barbed wire, the Chengdu Road police station also increased the number of Chinese and Western police officers to maintain order as much as possible, which is very good.

### Money Industry Prepares for Year-End Closing - Convenes Three Meetings - Discusses Collection of Interest on Loans and General Business - Low Interest Rates on Foreign Loans Break Previous Records

With the year-end closing of accounts for all money shops on February 7th fast approaching, the Money Industry Association has scheduled three meetings to actively prepare for various procedures before the closing period: (1) The executive committee will be convened at 2:00 PM on the 25th of this month to discuss the time for all shops to collect bills and the time for remitting funds. (2) A general meeting of representatives of all member shops will be convened at 2:00 PM on February 2nd to discuss the January loan interest and listen to the general report on the collection of funds by the money houses. (3) A winter managers' meeting of all shops will be convened on the 25th of this month or the 2nd of next month to discuss general issues related to the year-end closing and business reform matters. It has been observed that in previous years, the year-end closing of accounts for all money shops has always been accompanied by new and different trends in the financial market, or the exposure of unstable situations, and various industries were inevitably affected by these difficulties. However, after the authorities of the Ministry of Finance worked hard to stabilize wartime finance and implemented measures to stabilize various industries in Shanghai, the financial market in Shanghai improved significantly and is now stable. Yesterday, the interest rates on foreign loans both in the morning and afternoon were as low as 1.2%, which broke previous records. It is also understood that the interest on long-term credit loans from various money shops can be fully paid to the money houses by the end of this year according to the agreed dates. The procedures for collection and remittance by various shops have been particularly busy in recent days.

### Central Bank, Communications Bank, Farmers Bank, and Bank of China Regulate the Legal Tender Situation in Shanghai - Bank of China Issues One-Yuan Notes and Subsidiary Notes - HSBC Checks on the Inventory of Subsidiary Notes and Unissued One-Yuan Notes

After the Ministry of Finance instructed the joint office of the Central Bank, Communications Bank, Farmers Bank, and Bank of China to find ways to regulate the shortage and panic of subsidiary coins and notes in the Shanghai market, a reporter from the New Voice News Agency inquired with banking circles and learned the following: (1)

Subsidiary Coin Notes: The Central Bank commissioned the American company Wing Ning to print the first, second, third, and fourth batches, each worth 500,000 yuan. These batches have been printed and issued by the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank. The fifth batch, also worth 500,000 yuan, has also been sent to the printer and will be issued immediately after the fourth batch. Businesses must submit a letter of application to the Central Bank to obtain these notes, which will be issued after the bank approves the application. (2)

Subsidiary Notes: Three batches, totaling 1.5 million yuan, were shipped by HSBC. These are new versions of the one-dime notes issued by the Central Bank and the Farmers Bank. HSBC only issues these notes to British companies and factories. More than half of these notes are still in storage and have not been issued. As for the Central Bank's exchange of five-dime subsidiary notes issued by the Central Bank and the Farmers Bank, each person is limited to 25 yuan. (3)

According to merchants and residents on the Qinghu Highway in western Shanghai, at 9:00 AM the day before yesterday, more than 100 Japanese soldiers from the Japanese army in Xujing Town on the Qinghu Highway departed from the town and marched towards Beishujing via Panlong Town. Suddenly, the Gu Unit of the ×th Detachment of the Songhu Guerrilla Forces discovered them. Taking advantage of the Japanese army's unpreparedness, they launched a surprise ambush, inflicting many casualties. Subsequently, in the afternoon of that day, a large force of Japanese reinforcements arrived, totaling two to three hundred soldiers. However, the guerrilla forces, having completed their mission, safely withdrew. The Japanese army then searched Guanyintang Town and was attacked again by the Gu Unit, resulting in a fierce battle.

### Japanese Spokesman's Remarks on Troop Withdrawal - Using Military Reasons as an Excuse for Not Withdrawing - Everyone Knows Their Intentions

According to the North China Daily News, the spokesman for the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai stated yesterday (the 17th) that if the Chongqing government continues to take military action to resist Japan, the Japanese army cannot withdraw from China. The issue of troop withdrawal depends entirely on the ability of the Chinese to maintain peace and order. The Japanese army is stationed in North China according to the Boxer Protocol, and other countries also have permanent troops stationed there. If this treaty continues to be valid, then Japan should also station troops there. It is unimaginable for the Chongqing government to make the withdrawal of Japanese troops a prerequisite for peace. As for the report in the local newspapers that the opening of the Yangtze River, telegraphed from Tokyo, has been delayed due to [local conditions], it is not accurate. The new Japanese cabinet will reopen the Yangtze River as soon as possible within its power, but only as far as Nanjing.

### Ministry of Economic Affairs Clarifies Truth About Restrictions on Exports and Internal Transport from Shanghai Factories - No Discrimination Against Factories Not Seized and Exploited - Hopes to Tell Manufacturers Not to Be Misled by Rumors

The Shanghai China National Products Manufacturers Association previously saw a report by the Chongqing American United Press, stating that the Ministry of Economic Affairs had ordered that, from now on, all manufactured goods from guerrilla areas, including those manufactured in the Shanghai settlements, would not be allowed to be transported to locations controlled by the Chinese government. The association believed that if this news was true, the national goods factories in the two settlements in Shanghai would be forced to shut down, which was a matter of great importance. On November 30th of last year, they telegraphed the ministry to inquire about the truth and to explain the difficult struggles of the national goods factories in Shanghai. It is now learned that the association received a reply from the Ministry of Economic Affairs with the document number Shang Zi 40952 yesterday. The original telegram stated, "To the China National Products Manufacturers Association: We have learned of your urgent telegram No. 3 dated November 30th of this year. The government has absolutely no discrimination against industrial and commercial enterprises in Shanghai that have not been seized and exploited by the enemy. The reported news is not accurate. Please inform the manufacturers not to be misled by rumors. This is very important. [Signed] Weng Wenhao, Minister of Economic Affairs [Official Seal]"

### Nanjing Almost Becomes a World of Opium - Only Japanese Live Comfortably - Spiritual Food Has Disappeared

According to the Continental Daily, Mr. Gould, the editor of the English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post, recently traveled to Nanjing and returned to Shanghai. He wrote an article in the current issue of the China Critic Weekly, stating that there are only two ways for Chinese people to survive in Nanjing: either work for the Japanese or engage in small-scale business. There are 7,000 Japanese residents in Nanjing, and under the protection of Japanese bayonets,

They live comfortably. The Japanese announced that the Yangtze River would be opened to Nanjing, but foreign residents there did not seem to care. According to reports, "Unless we and the Chinese regain the freedom to trade, this move by the Japanese is of no significance." Gould also cited a report by Dr. Bates stating that one-quarter to one-third of the Chinese in Nanjing

Are addicted to smoking. He said that the only shops run by Chinese that were truly attractive were those that wholesaled opium. Each hung a sign that clearly stated "Official Opium". The puppet government, under the guise of suppressing opium through taxation, allowed the sale of opium and obtained large amounts of revenue. Many other large shops have Japanese "dry shares", meaning that they do not invest but have the right to manage. Otherwise, they are subjected to

Various Obstacles. The police have been able to restore order somewhat during the day, but at night they close the police stations and return home. It is said that the police originally had rifles, but no bullets. However, there was also the danger that the rifles would fall into the hands of the guerrilla forces, so now they only carry batons. At night, a baton is not enough to defend themselves, so they all go home to hide. However, the situation inside the city is better

Than in the Suburbs. The number of residents has increased from 150,000 to 500,000. The Japanese brag about this, but these people are all poor and helpless, and the number is far from the million residents of the past. Culture has disappeared, and legitimate printed materials, theaters, or other spiritual food have all disappeared. Food from the countryside has been monopolized.

### Muslims' "Eid" Festival - To Be Held at 8:00 AM Tomorrow - At Various Mosques

### Japanese Warship Lingers - Zhenhai Fortress Takes Strict Precautions - Location of Shell Impact the Day Before Yesterday Has Been Identified - Shanghai-Ningbo Passenger Ship Once Sailed Away from Anchorage

At 6:00 AM on the 16th, the Japanese warship that shelled Zhenhai appeared again at 10:00 AM the day before yesterday on the sea surface opposite the Liaobiao Cape, diagonally opposite Qili Island. It did not leave until 3:00 PM, and returned again in the evening, still lurking. The Liaobiao Cape is eight miles away from the mouth of Zhenhai. It has not left, but it is expected to fire again, so the Haifu ship of the Reiss & Co. and the Ping An ship are unloading cargo outside the harbor. A telegram has already reported this. The rumor that the Japanese warship outside the mouth of Zhenhai fired again the day before yesterday is not true. However, Dason Harbor in eastern Yin is also an important coastal area. A Japanese warship also fired several shells at the shore the day before yesterday and then fled.

Location of Shell Impact

As for the Japanese warship shelling Zhenhai on the 16th, it fired a total of two times. The first time was from 6:00 AM to 6:30 AM, and the second time was at 2:30 PM in the afternoon. The first time, it fired a total of 16 shells, and the second time, it fired a total of 11 shells. Apart from a few shells landing in Xiepu Longshan in Zhenhai County and Guanhaiwei in Cixi County, only one house was destroyed in Xiepu, while the rest landed on barren beaches. Many shells also landed at the foot of Golden Rooster Mountain outside the mouth of Zhenhai, but there was no damage. The Ningbo Garrison Command, in view of the harassment caused by the warship's shelling, has strictly ordered the Zhenhai Fortress and the coastal defense forces of Fenghua, Xiangshan, and Yin counties to be on high alert.

Navigation as Usual

As for the Shanghai-Ningbo shipping route, it is still open and unobstructed. The Shanghai-Ningbo passenger ship sailed away from the anchorage to the Licang sea surface to temporarily avoid the Japanese warship's shelling. Yesterday, seeing that the Japanese warship had sailed away, the ships returned to the anchorage and resumed loading and unloading cargo and passengers as usual. The Haifu ship of Reiss & Co. is scheduled to return to Shanghai from Zhenhai this morning (the 19th) and is expected to arrive in port in the evening. The Deping ship of the Sino-Italian Company and the Heda ship of Hualun were originally scheduled to return to Shanghai today, but due to the above-mentioned reasons, they have been slightly delayed. They are expected to return to Shanghai within this week. The Ficon ship of the Lou Lin Foreign Company arrived in Shanghai on the 17th. It was originally planned to go to Zhenhai yesterday, but due to insufficient loading, it has been rescheduled to depart at 4:00 PM today, heading to Zhenhai. The Hanazhen of the Far Eastern Company, which had previously changed its route to Songmen, returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday (the 17th) and is scheduled to continue sailing to Songmen at 3:00 PM tomorrow afternoon.

### Due to Tight Foreign Exchange During Import, Coal Prices Are Manipulated - Coal Industry Agrees to Group Purchase - Persuading Stockpilers to Appraise and Release Inventory

The price of coal fuel in this city has been illegally manipulated, causing market prices to rise, resulting in unnecessary losses for various industries. The cooked food industry and others are currently devising methods to implement group coal purchases to cause coal prices to fall naturally. However, after the Nationalist Army moved west, the domestic coal-producing areas were occupied, leading to the disruption of domestic coal shipments to Shanghai. The coal required in Shanghai is mostly imported from Annam, India, Taiwan, and Japan. Currently, due to the stalemate in the European war, these coal-producing areas have also eased restrictions, allowing coal exports. As a result, the supply of smoked and white coal is increasing, with sufficient inventory. However, market prices have fallen. According to news from the coal industry yesterday, coal merchants purchased coal at higher costs during the previous period of tight foreign exchange. Although current prices are lower, selling prices have not yet balanced out. The coal industry has expressed support for group coal purchases and has decided to participate in discussions. They also decided to persuade those who are stockpiling to appraise and release their inventory in order to flood the market with available goods. It is reported that coal shipments to Shanghai have not been interrupted in recent days and have been mostly unloaded into warehouses in Pudong and western Shanghai.

### Robbery on Chengdu Road Last Night - Patrol Officer Shoots Down One Thief - Stray Bullet Injures Three Pedestrians, Two Seriously

At around 7:45 PM last night, three robbers suddenly appeared at 776 Chengdu Road. One robber, armed with a handgun, broke into the premises with the intention of robbery. The owner shouted for help, and the robbers, realizing the situation, did not dare to stay long and retreated together. At that moment, patrol officer No. 12330 from the Xinzha Police Station had already arrived, hearing the commotion. He hid beside a utility pole on the side of the road. Seeing the robbers approaching, he quickly drew his gun and fired four or five shots, hitting one of the thieves. The thief fell to the ground with a direct hit. The patrol officer apprehended him. The other two robbers escaped. During the exchange, stray bullets injured three pedestrians: Chang Qiaoyun (a ten-year-old girl), shot in the abdomen with intestines protruding, residing at 505 Avenue Haig; Liu Daozhi, from Yuyao, 23 years old, gunshot wound to the abdomen, penetrating the bladder; and Wei Zhaochang, 15 years old, from Shaoxing, shot in the right foot, residing at 54 Heping Lane, Avenue Haig.

### Relying on Special Influence to Block Vegetable Boats - Western Constable Beaten and Injured - Suspects Still Under Investigation

Ruffians Xu Nianqing (nicknamed "Little Xu"), Cai Chunquan, Yang Renjia, Chen Yongming, etc., from Tongzhou, have been wreaking havoc on the Huangpu River since the Shanghai War, relying on their special influence. Recently, they have been serving as inspectors at the Hongkou "Vegetable Market," commanding a gang of over thirty followers. They often intercepted vegetable boats traveling to and from the Huangpu River, forcibly directing them to the "market." At around 4:00 PM on the 15th of this month, four vegetable boats belonging to the Touba Celery Company were passing the Wusong Road intersection inside the Garden Bridge when they were spotted by these individuals. They approached and intercepted the boats. While they were arguing, Fox, a Western police officer from the Customs Water Police Station, was patrolling in a boat and approached to mediate. Unexpectedly, the violent mob, without asking the reason, severely beat the Western police officer, causing serious injuries. Subsequently, the Water Police Station dispatched detectives to Pudong and arrested accomplices Zhou A'gen and Chen Linfu. They were transferred to the French Concession Police Station and yesterday were sent to the Eighth Criminal Division of the Second Special Court for prosecution.

The thugs immediately drew sharp blades and stabbed Zhang Xiuzhen repeatedly in the head and face, with her right ear almost being severed. She lost consciousness in the pool of blood. The murderers, seeing that their goal had been achieved, fled in all directions. Zhang Youxiang returned home and was shocked by what he saw. He immediately reported to the French Concession Police Station, who used an ambulance to take the injured person to Guangci Hospital for treatment. It is reported that a month ago, the woman had been doused with corrosive acid. She went to the hospital for treatment. Whether this murder was due to a love triangle or other reasons is currently unknown.

### Accused of Bigamy - Jurisdiction Error - Further Trial Pending Ruling

Huang Jiegang, a 26-year-old from Chongming, works in the catering department of the International Hotel. Since childhood, his parents arranged for him to be betrothed to a woman from the same village, Zhu (27 years old this year). After they married in Chongming on the 18th day of the fifth lunar month last year, he left Zhu in the countryside and came to Shanghai, abandoning her. Unexpectedly, on the 12th day of the twelfth month last year, Huang married his lover, Zhang Min (20 years old this year), a woman from Wuxi, at the Zhongshe on Weihaiwei Road and lived with her at No. 18 Changxing Lane, Beile Road. When Zhu in the countryside learned that Huang and Zhang had married at Zhongshe, she chased them to Shanghai and obtained Huang's marriage certificate. After unsuccessful negotiations, Zhu entrusted lawyer Zhang Shibeng to report to the French Concession Police Station, accusing Huang Jiegang of bigamy and requesting prosecution. The police chief approved the request and sent detectives to detain Huang and escort him to the Second Special Court for trial and detention, pending further investigation. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Miao Qingbang held a hearing for further questioning. According to the plaintiff Huang Zhu, along with matchmakers Zhu Yunian and Yao Wencai, appeared in court and recounted the details of their marriage with Huang and presented marriage invitations, gift registries, and letters from Huang as evidence. The court ordered the two witnesses to be questioned separately, and their testimonies were consistent with Zhu's. Huang denied having married Zhu and admitted to marrying Zhang Min. Zhang Min also appeared in court, confessing in Mandarin to marrying Huang. She stated that she did not know whether Zhu had married Huang, but when she and Huang were engaged, Huang told her that his marriage in the countryside had been resolved. After verifying the statements, the judge stated that the location of the crime was not within the jurisdiction of the court and ruled that the defendant would be detained pending a ruling to transfer the jurisdiction to the relevant court for trial. Huang's defense lawyer repeatedly requested bail, but the court refused. He was taken away by the police for further detention. During the trial, Huang's friends and Zhang Min's father and brothers were present in court to listen.

### Public-Cooperative Construction Factory Owner - Assaults Foreman - Accused of Assault

Xu A'san, a 40-year-old from Nantong, was introduced on August 19th last year to work as a foreman in the Public-Cooperative Construction Factory owned by Ye Yuexiang (37 years old this year), who uses sand workers in Dingjia Lane, Lafayette Road. On December 27th, Xu was suddenly beaten by Ye for some reason, resulting in a broken foot bone and dislocation. He sought treatment at the hospital, but Ye ignored him. Therefore, Xu, represented by lawyer Xu Yinqian, filed a complaint in the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court, accusing Ye Yuexiang of assault under Article 277 of the Criminal Code, requesting legal punishment and attaching a civil suit for compensation for medical expenses and lost wages. Based on the complaint, the court, presided over by Judge Zhu Chuzhe, held a hearing. Because the defendant refused to receive the summons and did not appear, it was ruled to postpone the hearing. Yesterday morning, another hearing was held, and the defendant, accompanied by defense lawyer Su Jingqi, appeared in court to await questioning. First, the plaintiff's attorney stated the intent to prosecute, then questioned the defendant Ye Yuexiang, who denied the assault and claimed that he had gone to Nanjing on business last time, resulting in no one receiving the summons and therefore not appearing in court. Finally, his defense lawyer requested bail. The court ruled that the case still needed investigation and ruled to postpone the hearing to February 6th. The defendant paid a cash bond of two thousand yuan and provided a guarantor who would ensure his presence whenever summoned. He was detained in the absence of a guarantor.

The father, named Zhang A'long, 43 years old, had been unemployed for a long time and was extremely financially strained. A few days ago, he pawned his bedding for two yuan.

When his roommates didn't see any movement in the kitchen until 8:00 AM yesterday morning, they tried to look through the back window and saw that all four were poisoned by coal gas and unconscious. They immediately pried open the door, summoned an ambulance, and sent the four to the hospital for treatment. Fortunately, they were revived.

### Grain - Flour Factories Have Great Desires - No Hope for Lower Flour Prices? - Despite Abundant Flour Stocks, Flour Prices Remain Firm

Flour prices have yet to show any signs of easing. Factories claim that raw materials are becoming increasingly expensive, with imported wheat priced at an estimated 26 to 27 yuan per 100 catties. Therefore, it is indeed unlikely that flour prices will fall in the future. However, the current surge in flour prices clearly indicates that factories have great desires. While imported wheat is certainly expensive, previous wheat stocks did not cost as much as they do today. Yet, factories are unwilling to increase production, only maintaining their retail sales in this district. Wholesale orders are not fulfilled, effectively halting customer sales, thus contributing to the continuous rise in flour prices. As for the "reclaimed goods" market, it is not a legitimate market. It is a transaction between general grain merchants who have already purchased goods from the factory or those holding warehouse receipts, with a very limited volume. If factory supply is consistent and sufficient, this type of illegitimate market would naturally disappear. Furthermore, Shanghai's flour stocks are estimated to be as high as 700,000 to 800,000 bags, so there is no shortage. The flour being sold now should not be priced based on current wheat prices. Therefore, flour factories are making significant profits. They intended to push prices beyond the 10-yuan mark, but the presence of imported flour on the market has led them to restrict customer sales, causing those in need to turn to imported flour. As a result, 5,000 to 6,000 bags of imported flour continued to be traded in the market yesterday, reaching a high of 11 yuan. Once imported flour is cleared out, the price increase of domestic flour will be fully justified. Moreover, with the "reclaimed goods" market for domestic flour still showing illegitimate prices of 11 yuan, imported flour is considered cheaper. Currently, the wholesale price of No. 2 flour in this district has surprisingly reached 10 yuan. However, since Shanghai primarily consumes rice, the impact has not been felt as severely. If hoarders continue to refuse to release their stocks and factories continue to restrict supply, they will become public enemies of the hundreds of thousands of residents. Yesterday's official market prices were 10.95 yuan for old Chepai warehouse receipts, 10.09 yuan for Bingshun, and even 11 yuan for the Phoenix brand of Japanese flour spot goods, reaching a peak.

Wheat - Trading was sluggish again yesterday, but the market moved forward. Sellers, buoyed by firm flour prices, continued to hold out, aiming for a price of 20 yuan. They were unwilling to sell unless it reached 18.5 yuan, causing factory buyers to hold back. It is reported that wheat from Suzhou and Wuxi has been traded above 18.25 yuan, rising further. The new high price of 18.5 yuan may be realized.

### Abundant Imported Rice Transactions - Shipments Arriving Continuously in Shanghai

Non-glutinous Rice - After the rice market repeatedly fell previously, the situation suddenly tightened again near noon. Yesterday, the market sentiment further increased due to the limited supply from inland sources. Sales were active both in local and out-of-town shops, with traders from inland regions actively buying. However, they all focused on Saigon and other imported rice varieties. While short-grain and early-season rice were scarce in the market, their transactions were only sporadic. Therefore, once Saigon and other imported rice became active, prices immediately rose. No. 1 Saigon rice initially sold for 37.3 to 37.4 yuan, then rose to around 38 yuan. No. 2 Saigon rice also sold for around 37 yuan, and mechanically milled rice sold for 36.8 yuan. Other Tokyo rice varieties rose from 34.5 yuan to 33.8 or 33.9 yuan, rising by about 0.6 yuan. Although domestic rice varieties such as short-grain did not have as large of a volume of transactions as imported rice, prices also rose by 0.3 to 0.4 yuan. Apart from regular short-grain, which remained at 40 yuan, extra-fine rice from Qing Si was priced at 38 yuan, while Bai Yuan rice was sold widely, also rising by 0.4 to 0.5 yuan. Extra-grade rice from Liyang was priced at 38.5 yuan. It is estimated that total market transactions did not exceed 12,000 to 13,000 bags.

Imported Rice - The morning market continued to show a stable trend. Subsequently, with shops and traders from inland regions absorbing at lower prices, the market and sentiment rose uniformly, with prices of various grades rising by 0.2, 0.3, or 0.4 yuan. Saigon No. 1 was once quoted at 38 yuan, with the highest negotiated price being 37.8 yuan. Broken rice also rose after an initial period of stability. However, with uniform international pricing, both Chinese and foreign merchants were offering at lower prices. As a result, Da Fu sold 200 tons at a price of 33.16 yuan, and Jian Yuan sold 400 tons at a price of 33 yuan. There were many other negotiations, which may be finalized in the coming days.

Also reported - Large batches of imported rice continue to arrive in Shanghai. The Jardine Matheson's Taisheng ship arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday (the 17th), transporting 4,500 bags from Haiphong and 2,191 bags from Hong Kong, which were unloaded at the Roosevelt Wharf warehouse. It is reported that an even larger quantity of imported rice, 20,387 bags, is arriving in Shanghai today, directly transported from Saigon by the French postal ship Felix Roussel, scheduled to arrive in port at 8:00 AM this morning and berth at the Shuntai Wharf in Hongkou for unloading.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Soybean and Sesame Seed Markets Show Divergent Trends

Yesterday, soybean prices continued to rise by 30 to 40 cents, mainly due to tight supply. Powerful players were actively hoarding in the market. Furthermore, local oil mills have already sold off their February delivery of Fourth Brand soybean cakes (7,000 pieces were traded at a price of $9.25, purchased by speculators), boosting market confidence and activity. Ding Jia Zhou soybeans broke through the $20 mark, opening at $20.02, with 500 bags traded. Wu Hu soybeans were priced at $19.60 to $19.55, settling at $18.70, with over 1,600 bags traded. Nan Jing soybeans opened with 7 cars at prices of $19.60 and $19.30, settling at $18.50 to $18.20. Qing Dao soybeans, 200 bags, were priced at $22.55. An Qing soybeans, 300 bags, were priced at $19.70. Chong Ming yellow sand soybeans, over 180 bags, were priced at $20 to $19.80. The sesame seed market remained stagnant, with overall supply exceeding demand, making a turnaround difficult in the short term. Only 150 bags of Ming Guang sesame seeds were traded yesterday, priced at $32.50, and 50 bags of Yang Zhou sesame seeds were traded at $28.50, handled by our local office.

### Finance: US Dollar Re-enters the $8 Range; Rumor Telegrams Trigger Panic Buying

The foreign exchange market yesterday: HSBC's posted exchange rates remained unchanged. The unofficial market for British and American currencies initially weakened slightly, then eased further, resulting in a flat mid-day market. Unexpectedly, market participants became unduly alarmed in the afternoon, causing significant market fluctuations. This was due to absurd and unfounded rumor telegrams. Those with weak resolve panicked, becoming a laughingstock. However, market prices were significantly affected. The gradual easing of the past two days immediately tightened to 4 7/8125 and $7.90625. As for the day's trading, the market opened slightly tight, at 4 7/875 and $8.03125. Subsequently, reaching higher prices proved difficult. However, shortly after, telegrams from Hong Kong began to arrive and exporters also slightly reduced their offers, causing the market to firm. The price briefly eased to 4 9/0625 and $8.09375. Then, Sassoon increased its long positions, and some settlement payments also occurred, causing the market to weaken again. The mid-day close remained the same as the morning opening. In the afternoon, as the rumor telegrams spread throughout the market, speculators began aggressively buying. Furthermore, Sassoon continued to settle forward US dollar contracts, and supply from external sources was particularly weak. The market immediately tightened to 4 7/8125 and $7.90625. Although external sources sold slightly, causing a brief rebound, HSBC's buying ultimately caused the market to close lower at 4 7/828125 and $7.9375, tighter by 0.0625 and 0.125 compared to the previous day. The trend in the forward market mirrored that of the spot market.

No Major Fluctuations in the Morning

The morning began with London's short and long-term rates up 4.375, New York silver prices unchanged, and London gold steady. Exchange rates for British pounds against US dollars, Shanghai dollars, and French francs were all unchanged. The US dollar fell 1.125 against the British pound, was unchanged against the Shanghai dollar, and down slightly (0.075) against the French franc. The central bank's posted rates for all currencies remained the same. Banks' opening spot selling prices were 4 7/875 for the British pound and $8.03125 for the US dollar, down 0.015625 and up 0.03125, respectively, compared to the previous close. After opening, the market continued to weaken slightly in quiet trading, with reaching higher prices of 4 7/875 and $8.03125 proving difficult. Fortunately, Hong Kong telegrams arrived soon after with offers, and exporters also sold slightly, immediately causing the market to firm. Hong Kong telegrams sold spot British pounds to external sources at a favorable rate of 4 8/90625, and sold spot US dollars to a certain bank at $8.0625. Subsequently, exporters also sold spot US dollars to external sources at $8.09375. At that time, external sources were also offering to buy spot British pounds at 4 9/0625. HSBC's posted exchange rates remained unchanged. The silver balancing tax rose by 0.0275. After this, selling pressure subsided, and a certain foreign bank showed strong appetite. The market softened again. Soon after, Sassoon slightly increased its buying of this month's British pounds at 4 8/59375 and this month's US dollars at $8.00. Importers also followed suit, settling at a favorable spot US dollar rate of $8.03125. Therefore, the trading process remained stagnant until the mid-day close, with banks' spot selling prices remaining the same as the morning opening.

Abrupt Tightening in the Afternoon

The market initially softened slightly after opening in the afternoon. Foreign banks' selling prices were only 4 8/59375 for British pounds and $8.00 for US dollars. At 2:20 PM, the sudden appearance of certain rumors in the market caused general speculators to buy aggressively, regardless of the truth. Furthermore, Sassoon also aggressively bought February US dollars, causing the market to gradually tighten. British pounds fell to 4 7/8125, and US dollars tightened to $7.90625. Subsequently, as foreign banks' selling interest increased slightly, the market rebounded briefly. By 2:50 PM, British pounds had rebounded to 4 8/4375, and US dollars had also rebounded to $8.00. Later, because HSBC also began buying, including spot British pounds from counterparties at 4 8/4375, the market weakened again. Until the evening close, banks' spot selling prices were 4 8/28125 for British pounds and $7.9375 for US dollars, 4 8/125 for this month's British pounds, and $7.90625 for this month's US dollars. The rates for next month were 4 7/65625 for British pounds and $7.8125 for US dollars. As a result, compared to the previous day, both spot and forward British pounds tightened by 0.0625, and both US dollars softened by 0.125.

Hong Kong, 18th: This morning, the exchange market opened flat. British and Japanese exchange rates were unchanged. Spot US dollars tightened by 0.0625, to $24.5625. Spot Shanghai dollars rose by $3, to $304. At 10:00 AM, spot US dollars eased by 0.0625, remaining at $24.625. At 11:30 AM, the market was flat, with no changes in rates.

Spot US dollars also weakened by 0.0625, to $7.5625. Shanghai dollars fell by $0.50, to $105.50. "Joint Notes" in the unofficial market continued to fall by $1.75, to $100.025.

### After Four Days of Declines, the Gold Market Rebounded Sharply

Yesterday's cash gold (cooked red) unofficial market conditions: After four consecutive days of declines, the situation this morning had already improved. Although no sharp increases were seen in the morning, the market had become extremely stable. However, in the afternoon, sudden rumors caused an unexpected surge, increasing by as much as $45, almost recovering the losses of the past four days in half a day. As for the day's progress, the morning opened with a six-dollar increase due to the tightening exchange market, followed by another eight-dollar increase. Later, gains and losses were balanced, making it difficult to distinguish any trend. However, because cash houses continued to actively sell, the mid-day close fell back to $4,035. The afternoon initially opened slightly higher by $2. At 2:10 PM, rumors began to spread, and the exchange market immediately tightened. Securities firms bought aggressively, raising the price by $37, and the foreign exchange market continued to report tightening. A certain bank and money exchange businesses bought heavily on behalf of the two Hong Kong groups. Although some people took profits and exited, the evening close had surged to a peak of $4,080. As a result, the squeeze resulted in $46. The entire day's trading volume was still active, around 1,500 taels. Silver shop jewelry gold remained steady, and customs gold remained flat.

Cash Gold (Cooked Red) Rebounded $46

Since the morning's initial opening, the market rose by $6 per bar (10 taels) due to a slightly tightening exchange market and improved sentiment. Silver shops bought from gold houses at $4,040 per ten taels. Subsequently, gold houses bought slightly, and retail investors also showed some appetite, pushing the price up another $8. Gold houses bought 20 taels from securities firms at $4,048. At that time, the foreign exchange market suddenly turned firm, causing sentiment to weaken. Money exchange businesses immediately began to offer, and cash houses followed suit, selling heavily. Most buyers were content to watch from the sidelines, and the price fell by $13. Money exchange businesses sold 30 taels to securities firms at $4,035. Afterwards, a certain money exchange business suddenly bought on behalf of customer groups, and a certain bank also bought on behalf of retail investors. At that time, the exchange market tightened slightly, and the price increased by $10. Gold houses bought 20 taels from money exchange businesses at $4,045. Then, silver shops showed strong supply intentions, hindering the upward trend. Soon after, cash houses and money exchange businesses sold to each other again, causing another decline. Money exchange businesses made 5 transactions of 50 taels at $4,035 as the closing price. The afternoon initially opened $2 lower, with cash houses selling 20 taels to securities firms at $4,033. Shortly after, rumors suddenly arose, and the foreign exchange market tightened, causing buying interest to surge. Securities firms bought aggressively, soaring the price by $37. Securities firms bought 20 taels from gold houses at $4,070. Subsequently, as the foreign exchange market rebounded, silver shops sold at the higher prices, causing a brief decline of $20. Money exchange businesses sold 30 taels to silver shops at $4,050. Later, because the foreign exchange market weakened again, retail investors resumed buying. A certain money exchange business (reportedly acting on behalf of Hong Kong groups) and a certain bank (acting on behalf of local groups) competed to buy. Although a certain securities firm still showed strong supply intentions, the demand was overwhelming, causing another surge of $30. Money exchange businesses bought 20 taels from silver shops at $4,080 as the evening closing price. As a result, the market rebounded by $46 compared to the previous day. After the close, the price rose further to $4,082, but silver shops sold, causing it to fall slightly to $4,076. The total daily fluctuation was $47. Cash houses' selling price for their own brand of gold was $10 higher than cash gold (cooked red), and the buying price was $20 lower. The current standard gold was over $50 lower than the posted gold, with few transactions.

Silver Shop Gold Jewelry Remained Steady

The exchange rate for silver shop jewelry gold per tael remained unchanged. Da Tong Heng continued to post $410. Xin Tong Heng was the same as the higher price, with the buying price about $15 lower.

### Foreign Currencies Strengthened Again

Yesterday, the demand for foreign currencies, British and American gold pounds, increased, causing market prices to strengthen. The supply and demand for British and American gold notes fluctuated rapidly. The US gold note initially rose to $12.46, then fell to $12.38. Rumors spread widely in the afternoon, causing the market to strengthen again. The evening market rose to $12.61. The supply of Hong Kong notes and French franc notes suddenly decreased. The demand for Singapore and Dutch notes increased. Annam rupee notes also became more expensive. Canadian notes and Philippine notes rose across the board. The supply of Japanese gold notes was abundant, causing the market to ease. The evening market fell to $1.26. Korean notes fell to $1.015 in the evening market. Yesterday's market prices: British and American gold pounds both rose by $1. British and American gold sovereigns both rose by $0.25. Hong Kong notes rose by $0.01. French notes rose by $0.003. Singapore and Dutch notes both rose by $0.10. Annam notes rose by $0.03. Rupee and Philippine notes both rose by $0.05. Canadian notes rose by $0.20. Other currencies were unchanged.

### Discount Rate Suddenly Rose by $7

Yesterday, the discount rate for exchange drafts suddenly surged. Initially, it was slightly lower at $20 per $1,000, but demand suddenly increased, causing it to rise sharply. By noon, it had reached $30, and in the afternoon, it fell slightly back to $27.50, up $7 compared to the previous day. The interest rate for the money exchange association remained unchanged, posted at 0.12 in both the morning and afternoon markets.

### Securities: Rumors Shake the Bond Market - Resulting in a Slight Rebound of $0.30 to $0.40

The unofficial securities market was extremely stable yesterday morning. Class C bonds reached a high of $51. The initial trading in the afternoon was also very strong. Subsequently, rumors from Shanxi Province spread incessantly, causing the market price to fall by a significant $1. However, because the news originated from Qingdao and was not credible, the market price rebounded by $0.50. The scale of the fluctuation was very large, rarely seen in recent days. Trading was more active yesterday morning, with strong buying of the 16th and 20th issues, but some selling of the 28th issue. Later, firms such as Xinfu, Runli, and Hengfu came in to buy, pushing the price of Class C bonds up to a high of $51. Because sellers were only Tongkang and retail investors, supply could not meet demand. In the initial afternoon trading, Xinfu and Lianhe were the strongest buyers of Class A and B bonds, raising prices by $0.20 to $0.30. More than ten minutes later, rumors suddenly arose, and many long positions exited the market, and short sellers surged like a tide, causing the market to fall by $1. Ultimately, because the news was not considered reliable, the market rebounded by $0.40 to $0.50. As a result, market prices rebounded slightly by $0.15 to $0.45. The total trading volume was approximately $1.5 million. A summary table is listed below.

Stock prices gradually increased. Initially, 30 shares of Zhejiang Industrial Bank were traded at $67, and later, 20 shares were traded at $68.50.

Yesterday, the Shanghai Stock Exchange Public Association handled settlements in the morning, which was extremely cumbersome. The market was quiet after the opening in the afternoon. Industrial stocks initially showed weakness, but stabilized near the close. Rubber stocks firmed due to the slightly tightening exchange market.

London, 17th: Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign bonds remained stable. There were no changes in any upper or lower-tier bonds.

London, 17th: Today's listed prices for British companies operating in the East remained stable. Only Fook Company shares fell by 6 pence, to 1 shilling. The rest remained flat.

### Yarn and Cotton: High Inventory Levels Lead to Another Decline in the Yarn Market

After stabilizing for two days, the yarn market declined again yesterday. This was because the Guangdong traders, who had been actively buying for two days, were now satisfied and temporarily paused their purchasing. As a result, sentiment suddenly softened, and many took profits. At the same time, the market felt that the inventory of 20-count yarn was still too high, requiring clearance. The situation became increasingly unstable. Furthermore, with the Lunar New Year approaching, everyone was preparing to close their books, creating an even more unstable market.

The spot yarn market opened with relatively strong sentiment, and prices were called out wildly. However, sales to customers were stagnant, and there were few buyers in the market. At the same time, foreign exchange was at a horizontal level, and the cotton market also remained in a state of fluctuation. The opening price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was $729. Few buyers were willing to pay this price. Upon hearing that the Hong Kong traders had no sales outlets, sellers suddenly increased, causing the market to fall directly downwards, dropping to $724. According to half-day trading statistics, 1,185 bales were traded. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn fell by $5, Heavenly Maiden fell by $6, and Double Globe fell by $4. Today, 464 pieces of yarn were shipped to Tianjin. The amount purchased by each trader is listed separately below.

### Cotton Sales Can Be Described as Quiet

Cotton trading has once again become quiet. With the Lunar New Year approaching, most cotton merchants are closing their books and have no time to focus on business. As for the factories, because yarn prices cannot increase and sales channels are narrow, trading has become increasingly sluggish. Cotton from northern Jiangsu arrived with 240 bales at Tongzhou and 234 bales at Changyinsha. 1,120 bales of northern sand cotton arrived. Furthermore, yesterday, 750 pieces of flying flower cotton were exported to Europe. The current cotton situation is listed below.

Another report: Foreign cotton market prices: New York cotton market: Initially fell yesterday morning due to selling by overseas cotton merchants, then rebounded due to trading by New Orleans traders. As a result, the market was relatively firm, down only a small 2-3 points. Spot prices rose by 5 points. Indian cotton, including forecasts, rose by 4 rupees. Egyptian cotton fell by more than 10 pounds. Liverpool rose by more than 20 pence.

Shanghai's foreign cotton trading was looser yesterday. Buyers relied on counterparties, and factories were not very active. Japanese manufacturers were particularly quiet. However, it is generally expected that prices will soar after the Lunar New Year. The yesterday's cotton market, converted to factory prices at a US dollar rate of $7.9375, is as follows.

### Hardware: Rebar Prices Soar, while Tinplate Sales Are Surprisingly Slow

Rebar trading, apart from purchases by local construction businesses, was otherwise rare. Furthermore, as each customer group is preparing to close their books, they have no intention of purchasing any goods. Only the local businesses are buying. Although yesterday's trading was not very smooth, counterparties' sentiments were unusually high (because the supply of these goods is insufficient, and Shanghai's inventory is limited). As a result, standard market prices soared, up about $50-60 compared to the previous market. The current market price is $870 per ton for 3/4-point sizes and $820 per ton for 5-point to 1-inch sizes.

The tinplate market has been quiet for a long time. The only sales channel for blue card goods (local yarn lock factories) has now been exhausted, and there is even less activity in outer ports. Therefore, the market situation is very bleak, and sentiment has also declined. However, because Shanghai's inventory is unusually low, standard market prices have not fallen. The current market price for No. 24 tinplate is $880 per box. American No. 26 tinplate (containing 56 sheets) sells for $400 per box, and British and Italian goods (containing 50 sheets) sell for about $370 per box.

### Silk and Tea: Italian Rayon Arrives in Shanghai - Large Quantities of Tea Shipped to Europe

Japanese rayon is flooding the guerrilla areas, causing the supply of genuine rayon to gradually decrease. Yesterday, the Italian ship Conte Verde arrived in Shanghai, carrying 57 boxes from Italy. Furthermore, 629 bales of Huzhou silk and 210 pieces of silk waste were shipped to Europe on the 17th.

6,830 boxes of tea were shipped to Europe on the 17th. Another 10 pieces were shipped to Yantai on the 19th, and 545 pieces were shipped to Tianjin.

### Sugar Market: Raw White Recovers

Yesterday, the raw white sugar market recovered due to tensions in the Netherlands, which may hinder supply. Sentiment improved, and prices rebounded. The Association's posted prices: Spot No. 24 raw white, local warehouse goods at $57, up one yuan; newly arrived goods at outer warehouses at $57.50, up $1.50; old goods at $57 to $56.50, up $1; transit goods at $46, up $0.50. Taikoo refined white sugar remained unchanged. B Mark, east warehouse at $57.50, west warehouse at $58. CW Mark, $57.50, east warehouse 57 bags. CX Mark, $56.60, west warehouse $56.80. DY Mark, $56.60. HX Mark, $56.50. Refined red and Dutch red remained stable. Local cotton white sugar rose by $1. Zhenji No. 1, $57; No. 2, $56.50. Local No. 1 ice sugar, $67.50. Jingming ice sugar, $69. The rate of increase was the same. National sugar house postings were firmer, but recent sales have been particularly slow, resulting in a lack of transactions. 50 bags of sugar arrived from Hong Kong yesterday.

### Dried Goods: Candied Tangerines Continued to Arrive

Candied tangerines have been arriving sporadically recently, but because sales to northern merchants are average, the market trend is weaker. It is reported that the companies are continuing to ship, and the quality is better than before, so they have added $2. The price has not actually increased.

### Tong'an Dried Longan: Top-Tier Goods Will Arrive Soon

The supply of top-tier dried longan has been tight recently, causing the market to be tighter. According to customer reports, a small amount has been shipped from Tong'an and is currently arriving at Gulangyu Island. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai soon.

### Coal: Cooked Coal Prices Decline

Since the coal briquette factory's prices stabilized, the cooked coal business has declined like water flowing downhill, and prices have also fallen. The counterparts are trading at $76 per ton for cooked coal lump, $74 for screened lump, and $72 for regular coal. Add another $2 for warehouse car delivery. Retail prices at shops are $4 per stove, or 25 pounds per dollar.

### Suffocated Infant

— Fang Ying

Incidents of infants dying from suffocation while sleeping with servants are sometimes read in newspapers or heard from relatives and friends.

While such incidents may seem directly attributable to the servant’s negligence, they can also indirectly be seen as a consequence of the parents’ choices. It is universally known that a person's mental and physical energy is finite. Consider a servant who spends the entire day from morning till night washing clothes and cooking. No matter how strong they may be, they will need a restful sleep at night. Even if they intend to stay vigilant, they may find it difficult to do so. Entrusting a child over one year old to a servant who is exhausted and unable to care for themselves is an unreasonable and inhumane demand. Ideally, mothers should take responsibility for caring for their children. However, many scientific books advise against mothers sleeping with their children, recommending that children sleep alone in small beds. However, this theory is often impractical for families with many children or limited financial resources. But at least one thing we can pay attention to is that if we cannot take care of the child ourselves, we should reduce the workload of the nanny who accompanies the child at night. Otherwise, when an unfortunate incident occurs, the servant will undoubtedly face legal consequences, but it is heartbreaking for parents to witness their lively and adorable child die from such cruel treatment, leaving lifelong regret.

I am writing this article to remind mothers who are unwilling to care for their children themselves to be cautious and to appeal on behalf of speechless infants.

### After Flour Prices Rise

— Xin Meng

Big Fried Dough Sticks Also Increase in Price by Three Cents Each

Restrictions Should be Implemented Quickly to Alleviate Pressure on Common People

Following the high price of rice, flour has risen again and again in recent days, quickly surpassing the ten-dollar mark. Anyone can see that the unlimited and unbridled rise in flour prices will have an impact on the livelihood of citizens no less than that of rice. The main reason is that rice has always been the primary staple food for Shanghai's four million residents, with flour being secondary.

Especially after the price of rice rose to forty dollars per dan (a unit of dry measure), many residents in the city who could not afford white rice switched to eating noodles. Even those who could afford white rice ate noodles every two or three days to save money. Particularly among the common people, noodles have almost become the primary food. We only need to see the general noodle shops crowded with people buying sliced noodles every morning to understand that Shanghai residents, in the face of high rice prices, have come up with the method of eating noodles as a remedy.

However, noodle prices follow flour prices. The soaring flour prices in recent days have caused noodle prices to rise again and again. White and yellow noodles have quickly risen from 15-16 cents per jin (a unit of weight) to more than 20 cents per jin. Eating a meal of noodles now costs almost as much as eating rice. If a family has seven or eight members, a meal of noodles will cost more than half a dollar. If people cannot afford rice, and now they cannot afford noodles either, has the "isolated island" truly become hell on earth?

Moreover, apart from sliced noodles, what kind of breakfast eaten by common people every morning is not made of flour? Fried dough sticks, big fried dough sticks, steamed buns, soup dumplings, and even bread and biscuits, are all made of flour, aren't they? Since fried dough sticks and big fried dough sticks have risen to two cents each, a coolie (manual laborer) has to spend about ten cents for a breakfast. The other two meals, lunch and dinner, are not even worth mentioning.

Not long ago, it was said that big fried dough sticks would rise again, selling for three cents each. But in the end, some have risen, while others still cost two cents each, only they have reduced the size to prevent people from buying them if the price rises. A coolie or poor person has to spend so much money on a breakfast, let alone those with families, parents, wives, and daughters. The cost of that one breakfast is frightening enough.

However, flour is still rising without limit. If this continues, there will inevitably be a day when big fried dough sticks will rise even further, and various flour-based foods will also be forced to increase in price, causing the common people to suffer the oppression of rising flour prices after experiencing the oppression of rising rice prices. In the midst of the soaring flour prices these days, we can already hear people setting up flour-based stalls complaining about the difficulty of doing business, while on the other hand, people who buy flour-based food are looking worried, saying that they cannot afford breakfast and will have to stop eating it if prices rise further.

The unlimited rise in flour prices, just like the price of rice, is of course due to manipulation by someone. Recently, members of society, in view of the high price of rice and its impact on the livelihood of citizens, have implemented measures to suppress it and will organize price-controlled rice sales. However, since the impact of the soaring flour prices on people's livelihood is no less than that of rice, we urgently hope that the concession authorities, in conjunction with all sectors, will quickly limit the price of flour as well to reduce the pressure on common people. This is also an urgent matter, isn't it?

### Rain After the Storm

— Bao Tianxiao

Episode 20: Global Communication Shares a Common Language; Children's Education Rewards Talent

It is said that today Lin Jiancheng and Jin Danyun are getting married at the International Grand Hotel in Shanghai, and people from various European and American countries have come to their wedding feast. This is because Yu Danyun is a guide for the National Diplomacy Committee, responsible for entertaining European and American dignitaries, so she has many interactions. These guides need to know the language and understand the speech of the country they are hosting. Yu Danyun only understands English and French, so she can only entertain those who speak English and French. However, English and French are widely spoken around the world. The vast United States of America speaks English. French is also prevalent in Europe and is considered the most elegant and regular language and writing. In addition, although Jin Danyun also knows a few phrases in Russian and German, it is not enough to entertain them. But many Russians can speak French, and many Germans can speak English. A person with higher education often speaks several languages or understands several scripts. Moreover, in recent years, many people in Europe and America can speak Chinese and understand Chinese characters. These people are not the missionaries who used to preach in the Chinese mainland. Those missionaries who preached in the Chinese mainland lived in China for twenty or thirty years, even forty or fifty years. They could not only speak Chinese very well, but also wore Chinese clothes. Things like loose-sleeved jackets buttoned down the front, square-toed shoes, melon-shaped hats, and scarlet hat tassels were common in the mainland and not surprising. Now, the people who speak Chinese and understand Chinese characters are not those missionaries, but people from all walks of life. For many years, Europe, America, and China have been exchanging students in various universities. European and American university students come to China, and Chinese university students also go to Europe and America. Every year, hundreds of students are exchanged in this way. Chinese students have been going to Europe and America to study for decades. However, more and more European and American students are coming to China to study, and this has only happened in the last ten years. Chinese students going to Europe and America to study prepare for the language and writing of the country they are going to in their own country, so when they arrive in Europe and America, they feel that they are achieving twice the results with half the effort. If European and American students study in China without understanding the Chinese language and writing, they will feel much more isolated. However, there are very few teachers in European and American universities who can speak Chinese, and their courses may not all have a Chinese language component. Therefore, many European and American students who come to China on exchange have to learn Chinese language and writing after they arrive in China, which is more difficult. Therefore, they have moved from exchanging students to exchanging teachers. (229)

### Test Drive

— Yu Xiangyun

In European and American countries with developed heavy industries, the advancement of transportation tools in terms of form and function has led to the progress of the enjoyment of the wealthy in Shanghai. Their cars are created with novel styles following the changing seasons, while we enjoy them as the seasons change. Not long after 1940 began, the latest 1940 models of cars have already begun to be sold. General car companies are scheming and arranging displays, welcoming the bourgeoisie to visit, test drive, and then hope that they will buy.

Buying a car, although not divorced from the principles and methods of transactions, the transaction situation is rarely seen. It is not as lively as a department store, nor as crowded as a theater. A large room, quiet, with shiny teak floors, glass windows, wiped clean and bright, a few Chinese and Western staff members, just sitting leisurely by the writing desks, waiting for the target of the business to arrive.

Because I was invited by a friend to join in the fun, I also acted like a wealthy person and became a car buyer. We drove an old car into a new car company on Avenue Foch, a group of people got out of the car, and the staff greeted us kindly and humbly, smiling and asking: "Have you received the samples we sent? ... It's rare for you to come, please come inside. Ha ..." While guiding us into the reception room. Then, cigars, cigarettes, tea, etc., were brought in on plates, male staff talked with men, female staff talked with us women, and even the two children were tired of them temporarily going to buy two bags of candy.

They explained the printed samples and manuals page by page, and the eloquent staff spoke volubly, although it was all exaggeration of the advantages of the car, but their eloquence was admirable. All kinds of brands of cars, from the motor to the seat cushion, from the glass window to the footrest, every part was described in detail; and, the situation of each car manufacturer and how it was transported to China were described in detail, which gave us a lot of knowledge that we had heard of before. According to a foreign female staff member: a certain car manufacturer is divided into several floors, each floor specializes in making a part of the car, from steelmaking to the completion of the car, all in this factory, without having to seek help from outside, the standard daily output is two thousand vehicles. Managers and salesmen are stationed in commercial ports around the world.

Walking into the car room, the shiny 1940 models of cars were truly numerous in name and style, some were small and delicate, some were tall and heavy. They guided us to sit in a new Buick car. Stepping on the motor, the new spring cushion was as soft as cotton, and the new chrome was as bright as silver. The so-called new advantages of 1940 are only such a practical enjoyment for the occupants. Although the external form is beautiful and unique, it is still an enjoyment for the carless class, and the occupants cannot see it at all.

Driving on a short road, forward, backward, turning, testing various actions, he also asked us to try driving ourselves. Then, we changed cars one by one, testing them tirelessly. After the test drive was completed, both parties agreed to decide on the transaction the next day. They were again very kind and humble to send us to our own old car, saying a series of: "Sorry, sorry! Please give us more guidance! ..."

### On Wulong Court

— Wang Hanzhai

There are two versions of "Wulong Court." One, based on "Water Margin" by Shi Nai'an, starts with Song Jiang making trouble in the court, then Liu Tang delivering the letter, and ends with killing the daughter-in-law in the tower. This is the performance of the Carlton Yifeng Society. The other starts with Liu Tang delivering the letter, then Song Jiang making trouble in the court, then killing the daughter-in-law in the tower, and finally capturing Zhang San alive. This is the performance of general theaters. The same play has different sequences of performance. Is this the difference between the Shanghai school and the Beijing school? However, judging from the plot, it seems that the sequence of performance by Yifeng Society is more reasonable and close to the situation, and the connection between the scenes is even more seamless. Because Song Jiang has not been to Wulong Court for a long time after making trouble there, he often walks in the street in his spare time, so Liu Tang can meet him on the street, this is the first point. After making trouble in the court, Song Jiang has not been to Wulong Court for a long time, and in addition to walking on the street in his spare time, he also goes to the restaurant to get drunk to relieve loneliness, so the waiter is familiar with him and extremely respectful. When Liu Tang follows Song into the restaurant and hides behind Song Jiang, the waiter does not have time to pay attention, so he does not feel that it is unreasonable, this is the second point. As for after Liu Tang leaves, Song Jiang wanders the streets, and Grandma Yan searches for Song Jiang on the street because he has not been to the court for a long time, which is also human nature, and meeting Song on the way is also not abrupt, this is the third point. Just separated from Liu Tang, so the letter and gold that Liu Tang was carrying on behalf of Chao Gai of Liangshan to Song are still in his pocket, absolutely without borrowing, and the audience all see it, this is the fourth point. With these four points, I think the sequence of scenes performed by Yifeng Society is desirable and reasonable. However, in the current society where the world is coming to an end and licentiousness is rampant, ending with a live capture is truly a work that benefits the world and people's hearts. It is only hoped that those who perform this play will not rigidly adhere to the words of the original script, resulting in the reversal of the order, which will make the whole play even more far-fetched. It is a pity.

### Talking About the Secrets of Health

— Xinliang

We all know that health is too closely related to human beings. No matter how much ambition or desire you have, if you are not healthy, then, even if you try your best, you will still not be able to succeed. This iron law also applies to movie stars. Can a thin, haggard person become a famous star in the film industry? Almost every star in Hollywood is strong and healthy. Even in China, isn't Chen Yunshang's success mostly due to her "healthy beauty"?

"Every day I have to walk on my toes in my bedroom for more than ten minutes." A famous model in a Hollywood studio told us: "This method can make our thick, unsightly legs gradually become thinner and longer."

"Three years ago, I started to constantly massage my fingers in my spare time. My fingers used to be very short and hard, but since I got this secret, they have become conical, slender, and beautiful fingers."

"I sleep about ten hours a night, and I drink at least nine glasses of water every day; two of them are prescribed to be drunk after getting up in the morning."

"I think that sufficient sleep, moderate exercise, and drinking more water will surely make our bodies always healthy. You know what? I have never had a cold, and I have never stopped working due to illness..."

### Random Notes on the Art Scene

— Hua

China Travel The "China Travel" Troupe this time returned to Shanghai and hastily signed a long-term performance contract with the Grand Palace. Also, because they performed a charity play "Resurrection" and Tang Huaiqiu himself made a guest appearance as Confucius in Minghua, the troupe affairs could not be fully planned, such as the call-up of the troupe members, the preparation of the script, etc., were not satisfactory. Therefore, after the public performance of "Lin Chong Flees at Night" and "Children of the Storm", a reorganization was implemented. A telegram was sent to Hong Kong to urge Tang Ruoqing to return to Shanghai immediately. According to Ruoqing's telegram yesterday (17th), "I will pack my bags and leave immediately." Therefore, the preparations for "Empress Dowager Cixi" have to be carried out as soon as possible; probably after Ruoqing returns, the troupe will stop performing matinee shows and concentrate on rehearsing "Empress Dowager Cixi", scheduled for the first day of the lunar new year. As for the play after "Children of the Storm", it is said that "Thunderstorm" will be restaged, but no decision has been made.

Drama Arts Society The Drama Arts Society has decided to publicly perform Yu Ling's "Daughter Kingdom" on the first day of the lunar new year, as mentioned in this magazine. Following "Chen Yuanyuan" is Schiller's original work, adapted by Gu Zhongyi, "Love and Intrigue", starring Murong Wan'er, who was highly praised in "Regret of the Late Ming Dynasty". Other plays prepared for public performance in succession include: Gu Zhongyi's "Liang Hongyu", Xu Xingzhi's adaptation of "Eternity" - i.e. "Camille", Yu Ling's "Emperor Taizu of Ming", and Lan Lan's adaptation of Ouyang Yuqian's "Peach Blossom Fan" into a five-act play. As for "Peking Man", which was announced during the first phase of public performances, if Cao Yu can send the script immediately, then we may be able to meet him in late spring or early summer.

### Unofficial Chronicles of the Pear Garden

— Xu Muyun

Luo Baisui Still Making Humorous Remarks in Critical Condition (Continued)

"I am so miserably harmed by two people!" Everyone hurriedly asked: "Who harmed you, old man?" Luo said: "One is Lao Tan, and the other is Gui Feng." Everyone was surprised to hear this, and said in unison: "Tan and Tian are both famous leading actors; and their popularity is not due to your good supporting green leaves to complement each other! Furthermore, it has always been known that you old brothers have a very good relationship, and there has never been any difficulty." After he heard this, he still did not explicitly state his meaning, stretched out one hand, first pointed to his throat, but only heard the sound of phlegm in his throat, and then pointed with his finger to the seam between the two wardrobes next to the couch, and gestured for the people next to him to put their hands on that seam, but felt the bone-chilling cold wind, although it was as thin as silk, it was ten times colder than the gale outside. One or two clever people among them understood the meaning of his two sentences. It turned out that what harmed him was the old phlegm blocking his throat (Lao Tan), and the cabinet seam through which the cold wind was blowing (Gui Feng). When he was critically ill, he casually said two sentences, but also made fun of the two most famous leading actors at the time: one was Tan Xinpei, and the other was Tian Guifeng. It can be seen that the performance of the predecessors of the actors is all natural, and what is called at hand becomes a wonderful truth, without seeking to be ingenious, it is ingenious. When Baisui performs a play, he can make the audience laugh through tears and make people laugh, and his demeanor and words offstage are enough to make people laugh, and he is indeed worthy of being the wine priest among the clowns.
