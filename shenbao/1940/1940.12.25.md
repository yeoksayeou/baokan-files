Washington: Yesterday's news stated that the US Navy has drafted a "route" from Hawaii to Singapore. This route includes oil stations, supply stations, and mooring bases on Palmyra, Kanton, Howland, Baker, and the Samoan Islands, as well as Port Moresby and Darwin in Australia. According to sources, although a formal agreement has not been signed, cooperation from Australia has been guaranteed. It is reported that discussions are limited to formal talks. (24th United Press Dispatch)

Singapore: Australian Army Minister Spender and Chief of General Staff Lieutenant General Sturdee have recently arrived here.

Manila: It was announced here today that twelve US giant submarines, including the newly equipped USS "Squalus", arrived in Manila two weeks ago, making the strength of the US Asiatic Fleet unprecedentedly powerful. The US naval strength concentrated here now includes three cruisers, the "Houston", "Marblehead", and "Cincinnati", three destroyer squadrons, twenty-six long-range patrol bombers, the aircraft carrier "Langley", eighteen giant submarines, six torpedo boats, and a transport fleet. The "Squalus," one of the twelve newly arrived submarines, is 299 feet long and sank to a depth of 240 feet on May 23, 1939, before being salvaged. As for the army's first-line strength in the Philippines, it has reached a new peak, with 80 aircraft, including three squadrons of fighters, one squadron of reconnaissance aircraft, and one squadron of bombers. The 17th Pursuit Squadron of Selfridge Field has now acquired "Republic" fighters ordered from Sweden. The Air Force Department claims that the "Republic" fighter is the "most desirable" aircraft in the Far East, unmatched by any aircraft currently in the Far East. Nichols Field has been converted into a fighter base, while bombers and reconnaissance aircraft are stationed elsewhere. The current army strength includes 10,000 regular US Army troops, as well as the Philippine Constabulary and twelve divisions of trained regular army reservists from the Philippines. Philippine officials hope that Washington will allocate US$5 million for the expansion of the Philippine Army. So far, Washington has made no decision on whether the United States or the Philippines should be responsible for civil defense, including air defense and food stockpiling.

Washington: Secretary of the Navy Hepburn has completed an annual report on the current state of the US Navy, which has been released by the Navy Department. The content praises the strength of the US Navy, stating: "I am responsible and report to the people that they can trust our navy without doubt. In my view, the US Navy is unparalleled in the world in terms of loyalty, morale, skill, and personnel. Compared with any country on an equal footing, it will never lag behind. However, given the current international situation, we must quickly strengthen our national defense so that we can cope with any enemy alliance attacking us in both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Our goal is to have a sufficient fleet to maintain complete freedom of action in one ocean while still maintaining the strength to effectively safeguard security in the other. In addition, the recruitment of reserves for the army and air force has been approved by the authorities, and the navy also urgently needs to recruit sufficient personnel to serve on existing ships or those under construction." Since the release of this report, President Roosevelt has taken various measures, so US naval officers and soldiers can be fully staffed in the shortest possible time. (24th Havas Dispatch)

### Britain's New Foreign Secretary; Eden Takes Office; Chongqing Newspaper Comments on British Cabinet Reshuffle; Believing It Will Contribute to the Overall Situation in the Far East

Stockholm: Britain's new Foreign Secretary Eden took office at 10:00 AM yesterday, returning to the former position he left to Halifax on February 21, 1938. Yesterday, Halifax and Eden discussed unresolved issues and handled private matters. (24th Huitong Dispatch)

Chongqing: The Central News Agency recently published a commentary on the British Cabinet reshuffle, saying that "Chongqing received the news this morning and was satisfied. Chinese sources unanimously believe that Lord Halifax's appointment as ambassador to the United States is a sign that the British government attaches importance to this position, and they believe that Halifax's appointment will further strengthen the already close Anglo-American cooperation. On the other hand, Eden's reassignment as Foreign Secretary will undoubtedly be welcomed by all of Britain's allies, because Eden's views and talents have long been recognized worldwide. His reappointment as Foreign Secretary will guarantee Britain's diplomatic victory. The Chinese are convinced that Eden's diplomatic experience will help develop reasonable diplomacy in the current chaotic situation, so that aggressive groups will respect international good faith and justice." The Chinese generally believe that Eden is more active and practical than others in opposing the use of appeasement towards aggressors, and they recall that Eden's previous split with the late Prime Minister Chamberlain was due to Chamberlain's appeasement of Germany. The Chinese all hope that after Eden's return as Foreign Secretary, Britain will adopt a more active diplomatic policy. Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the current British Ambassador to China, was appointed by Eden during his previous term as Foreign Secretary. Chinese sources unanimously believe that Kerr has made the greatest efforts to promote Sino-British relations. (24th Reuters Dispatch)

### Eden Encourages; Army Soldiers

London: When War Secretary Eden left the War Office yesterday morning to take up his new position as Foreign Secretary, he wrote to the Chief of the General Staff, General Dill, saying that the army would be responsible for deciding the overall situation when the final reckoning with Hitler comes. In his letter, Eden expressed his gratitude to the army officers and soldiers for their unwavering spirit and dedication to the country during this historically unprecedented emergency. Referring to the Egyptian campaign, he said that the brilliant victory of the British army in the Nile was the first reward for their courageous fighting, and that the quality of the British army in the Middle East, which is capable of winning victories, has now been demonstrated in Africa and will one day be demonstrated in Europe. (24th Reuters Dispatch)

### Halifax to the United States; Hull Expresses Pleasure

Stockholm: According to news from London, the new British Ambassador to the United States, Lord Halifax, will go to Lisbon on Christmas Day and take a clipper to the United States, hoping to take office in the New Year. (24th Huitong Dispatch)

### Eden is Skilled in Diplomacy; Feared by Germany

Berlin: German newspapers have launched a fierce attack on Britain's reinstatement of Eden as Foreign Secretary. The "Posener Tageblatt" said that the person who is now taking office as British Foreign Secretary is governed by psychological aversion throughout his activities. London hopes that this person's appointment as Foreign Secretary will improve Anglo-Soviet relations and strengthen its attitude towards Japan, Spain, and other Axis powers. (24th Reuters Dispatch)

### Japan's 76th Session; Parliament Opens; Restricting Party Participation; Depriving Freedom of Speech

Tokyo: The 76th session of the Imperial Parliament opened today amid restrictions on political parties. People are generally afraid that the Parliament will close the doors of freedom of speech under the banner of a "new national structure" from now on. Most of the first item in the Parliament is about organizational aspects. Only a simple ceremony was held today, and the date of the formal meeting is to be determined on Thursday. The Emperor will also attend in person. Today's meeting is the first under the slogan of the "New Order," and no political parties participated in the meeting. (24th United Press Dispatch)

TASS has recently been officially authorized to deny the report and solemnly declare that the report is completely fabricated from beginning to end. (23rd TASS Dispatch)

### Nomura Admits Japan and the United States; A Dangerous Storm

Tokyo: The new Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Kichisaburo Nomura, told reporters that he was sent to the United States twenty years ago, and that the great changes that have taken place in the United States since then were beyond his expectations. Changes are happening everywhere. In short, the world is now undergoing amazing changes, and these changes will add a new page to human history. These changes are inevitable, and all countries must adapt to this new environment. Japanese-American relations will also be adjusted according to this changing era. The recent deterioration of relations between Japan and the United States is undeniable. Although there have often been small waves in the long-term exchanges between the two countries, there has never been a situation like the current one. According to my experience as a sailor, ships often encounter bad weather during navigation. At this time, the captain must be calm, organized, and close the hatch openings. What is especially important is to safely weather the storm. What Japan and the United States need in this critical period is the character of a skilled navigator. Today is not a time for anger, nor is it a time for nitpicking and exchanging harsh words. Mutual recrimination will not help us weather this storm. What is needed today is a calm attitude, a calm mind, and a willingness to deal with the real environment in a practical manner. If Japan and the United States can take into account the above points, I believe that future disputes between the two countries will naturally not occur. (24th International News Agency Dispatch)

### American侨民 in Tianjin; Refute Matsuoka's Speech

Tokyo: Today, according to the Information Bureau, the Yokohama Specie Bank has signed an exchange agreement with the Java Bank, linking the Dutch guilder with the Japanese yen.

After the signing of this agreement, it is said that the current exchange rate between the Japanese yen and the Dutch guilder will not change, but the agreement stipulates that the two parties should consult each other if there is a need to change the exchange rate. (24th Reuters Dispatch)

The Tense Situation in Vichy; Has Not Completely Passed; Germany's Actions Depend on Pétain's Attitude; The French Government is Intensifying Internal Unity

French Border: After Vichy leader General Pétain rejected Germany's two demands for Franco-German military cooperation and the reassignment of Laval as Foreign Secretary, France is now watching Hitler's next move with anxiety. Some are deeply concerned that the German army will take lightning action to occupy the previously unoccupied French territory. Those who are paying attention to the border between the occupied and unoccupied zones of France claim that everything has remained calm since the Vichy government responded to Hitler's final demands. The Swiss newspaper "Lausanne Gazette" received a dispatch from Vichy stating that although the danger has not passed, Vichy is now gradually becoming optimistic. The French reply was sent on Sunday by Perillaud, Vichy's representative in the occupied zone, to Abetz, the German special envoy in Paris. Although the truth of the German demands has not been confirmed, the tension that enveloped Vichy last week suddenly dissipated after the reply was sent. People generally believe that General Pétain will never accept any political compromise that would damage the honor of the French army and navy. Another Swiss newspaper's dispatch from Vichy said that today's bulletin on France's condition shows that the fever has now subsided, but the patient's condition is still not out of danger. Germany's next actions are still unknown, but Pétain's reply has indeed been praised. French Foreign Minister Flandin met with guests yesterday, giving an optimistic impression. Many people went to see the borders of the German-occupied zone to observe German movements, but so far, there have been no changes in the situation in any zone. It is said that Flandin told people that he was sure that Hitler was satisfied with Pétain's reply, because the reply had obviously made some concessions. Neutral observers are now asking whether General Pétain's order to the French army to fight against Germany because Germany has violated the armistice agreement is enough to stop the Nazi war machine. After all, Germany is eager to gain a foothold on the Mediterranean coast and seize the French submarine fleet. If it cannot achieve this goal through peaceful pressure, it will inevitably send troops to occupy it. General Pétain has made statements to the French people that French unity must be maintained, and he is now striving to put this into practice. In other words, Pétain is now taking the opportunity to strengthen the discipline of the unoccupied zone and the French colonies, such as General Huntziger's inspection of the French Armistice Army and the French Navy in Toulon and North Africa, and General Weygand, commander of the French forces in Africa, inspecting French colonies and key points in Syria. (24th Reuters Dispatch)

Germany Uses War; To Threaten Vichy

A Swiss newspaper in Berne reported that Hitler had recently made threatening remarks, saying that if Vichy government Premier General Pétain continued to resist his demands for cooperation, he would cancel the armistice agreement between Germany and France and declare a new state of war between the two countries. If Hitler does this, he will occupy the unoccupied zone of France and control the ports of Marseille and Toulon on the Mediterranean coast. (24th Reuters Dispatch)

Colonial Minister; Advises Unity

Vichy Colonial Minister Vice Admiral Platon recently issued a notice to the governors of the colonies, which stated: "All senior colonial officials should work diligently in the spirit of the New France, and not forget that any actions you take must be guided by a sense of duty. All compatriots must follow Premier Pétain and move together towards the path of revival. Legitimate freedom should be respected, but no one should stand aloof from this difficult revival effort, as this kind of undertaking cannot be completed without national cooperation. Our people have always had a tendency towards disorganization and complacency, which has plunged the motherland into a deep abyss. We must strive to eliminate this in the future. Governors in all colonies should especially have a spirit of strict discipline and respect for honor." (23rd Havas Dispatch)

### Ambassador Leahy; Goes to France to Take Office

New York: The new ambassador to France, Admiral Leahy, set sail today on the cruiser USS "Tuscaloosa" to Lisbon, Portugal, and then to France to take office. (23rd Havas Dispatch)

Lyon: The French newspaper commented on the US government's appointment of Admiral Leahy as ambassador to France, saying that "Ambassador Leahy is a close friend of Premier Pétain and will bring a letter of introduction from President Roosevelt to Vichy. Our entire country will warmly welcome him." (23rd Havas Dispatch)

### Southern Ireland; State of Alert

Dublin: Military authorities have placed obstacles on many roads in southern Ireland and have armed guards stationed there. Anyone who does not obey the order to stop will be killed. According to official notices, drivers of vehicles must be especially careful, because these obstacles are semi-permanent in nature and can be found at any time on corners or turns. (24th Reuters Dispatch)

### Former Romanian King in Spain; Being Detained

London: Former Romanian Minister to the United Kingdom and current leader of the Iron Guard, Mr. Horia Sima, told Reuters reporters last night, "I (Sima self-identified) have good reason to believe that the life of the deposed Romanian King Carol is indeed in danger. He is being detained at the Andalusia Hotel in Seville under the orders of Spanish Foreign Minister Serrano Suñer, who is under pressure from Berlin. He cannot act or make any plans. What I want to clarify is that the Free Romania Movement does not intend to have any contact with the deposed King Carol, and I have no direct contact with the deposed King. However, the information I have received comes from reliable sources. The way Spain is treating individuals is extremely unfair, and I feel it is necessary to protest." (24th Reuters Dispatch)

Editorial

### Two Gifts of the Festive Season

December 25th is truly a joyous day for all: it is the National Renaissance Day of great China, the anniversary of the Yunnan Uprising, and also Christmas Day. Therefore, even in this world of continuous warfare, there is still significance in celebrating it heartily. Moreover, around this festive season, the old man of history has brought many gifts for the future of human civilization; among them, the two freshest are the formal announcement of the candidates for the Second Session of the National Political Council of China and the partial changes in the British ruling lineup. These are two independent events, but at this time, they symbolize two common meanings.

First, they symbolize greater unity. The candidates for the National Political Council of China symbolize the thorough unity of the Chinese nation, both domestically and abroad, across all regions, ethnic groups, parties, and factions. This is completely the same as the first session; the only difference is that the degree of unity symbolized by this session is even more widespread and close. The partial changes in the British ruling lineup symbolize the great unity between the United States and Britain, and among the various factions within Britain. Taking the appointment of the new Lord Halifax as the ambassador to the United States, Anthony Eden taking over as Foreign Secretary, and the rumored inclusion of Lloyd George in the cabinet to be responsible for domestic food and war material production as examples, Halifax is the current aristocratic Foreign Secretary of Britain. According to the traditional die-hard British mentality of despising the United States, this is indeed an unprecedented move to show special respect to the United States. On the American side, Halifax has always been classified as a typical Chamberlain figure, and his popularity in the United States is far less than that of Eden or Lloyd George. When Lothian's position was vacant, there were rumors that Eden would be transferred to be the ambassador to the United States. Not long ago, there were also rumors that Lloyd George would be sent to the United States, but neither materialized. Now, it is worth noting that the United States actually accepted and unanimously welcomed Halifax as ambassador to the United States, which is enough to show the complete trust of the United States in the overall national policy of the current British government. It is even more noteworthy that from now on, with Churchill, who represents the current national fortune of Britain in the eyes of the general American public, in power, and with the addition of Eden, Lloyd George, and others taking on important responsibilities, the cooperation between Britain and the United States will only become closer day by day. Furthermore, from the perspective of Britain domestically, it was already beyond everyone's expectations that Halifax was able to remain as Foreign Secretary after Chamberlain stepped down this spring. British public opinion and famous figures like H.G. Wells have repeatedly advocated that Halifax should immediately resign in order to fight Germany and Italy to the end. However, Churchill, his former political enemy, has been constantly defending him. One of the reasons why Eden resigned as Foreign Secretary in the spring of 1938 was precisely because of differences with Halifax's diplomatic views; and now, with one as Foreign Secretary and the other as Ambassador to the United States, it can be seen how closely they are working together. As for Lloyd George's inclusion in the cabinet, if it becomes a reality, then the Liberal Party, one of the three major political parties in Britain, will have another leader participating in shouldering the heavy responsibility of the wartime state. This will not only be Lloyd George's personal action, but also an important decision of the British Liberal Party. In such an atmosphere of cooperation and unity among British government officials and various political parties, the future British people and public opinion will inevitably become stronger.

Secondly, it symbolizes a thorough determination. Not long ago, Japan launched a large-scale "peace offensive," but it was immediately shattered by the firm expression of various Chinese authorities. In recent days, they have changed their tactics and launched a "rumor offensive." The announcement of the candidates for the Second Session of the National Political Council is ironclad evidence, enough to prove the complete groundlessness of the various bizarre reports recently published by Japanese newspapers. Regarding China's thorough determination, both friends and foes should now have no room for ambiguity, misinterpretation, or delusion. As for this reshuffle of British government personnel, it is a declaration of determination to fight Germany and Italy to the end, as well as a declaration to all anti-aggression countries and their allies, to adhere to their repeated vows and fight until the freedom of all European countries conquered by violence is restored. Since Eden resigned in February 1938, it has been the period when various countries on the European continent have successively lost their freedom and independence. Although they were conquered in different ways: the Spanish Republican government was strangled to death by the so-called "non-intervention policy," which was the price paid by Britain and France at the time for negotiating with Germany and Italy, and given to Mussolini and Hitler; Austria was occupied by Germany in one fell swoop with internal and external coordination under the tacit consent of Britain; Czechoslovakia lost its independence and autonomy due to the "Munich Conference"; Albania was occupied by Italy due to Britain's tacit consent to Italy's freedom of development in southeastern Europe; the remaining countries, such as Poland, Norway, the Netherlands, and France, were all direct results of military force. But no matter what, they were all direct or indirect victims of Chamberlain's rejection of Eden and his insistence on implementing his own diplomatic line. Looking back further, from the time Eden served as Lord Privy Seal in 1934, to his transfer to Foreign Secretary in 1935, until his resignation in the spring of 1938; during this period, he repeatedly fought for various principles of the League of Nations against and restricting aggression; and his final resignation was precisely because his diplomatic views on Italy were completely contradictory to those of Chamberlain and Halifax, and he was subjected to significant pressure and coercion from Mussolini to replace him. Therefore, at that time in Britain, he was the biggest obstacle to Chamberlain's cabinet's attempt to adjust diplomatic relations with Italy; but after his resignation, he was loved by the entire British people and regarded as a martyr for Britain's major external humiliation, and he has always become a concrete symbol of Britain's League of Nations line and spirit. Mussolini should be the first to have a headache about Eden's return as Foreign Secretary. Under the leadership of Churchill, whom Germany considers its greatest enemy, plus Eden's diplomacy, whom Italy considers its biggest opponent, and if Lloyd George, who defeated Germany in the First World War, is added, then Germany and Italy should completely abandon any illusions of inducing Britain to negotiate "peace." As for the Eastern violent elements who have been repeatedly "condemned" and "unrecognized" by the League of Nations, it can of course be pointed out here the inevitable trend of their future relations with Britain.

### Sichuan Province Investigates and Reports Largest Grain Merchants, Performance of Each County Publicly Announced, Chiang Orders Severe Punishment for Negligent County Magistrates, Dismissal or Major Demerits Assigned Separately

Chongqing: The government is currently rigorously cracking down on grain hoarding. In addition to yesterday's execution by firing squad of Yang Quanyu, who hoarded and speculated, a secret order has been issued to all counties in Sichuan Province to investigate and report the largest hoarding merchants within their borders. It is reported that Chairman Chiang, based on reports from the National Food Administration and the Sichuan Provincial Government, has separately rewarded and punished the county magistrates according to the merits of their investigations. The following is an excerpt of the order from Chairman Chiang to the National Food Administration and the Sichuan Provincial Government: "Regarding the case of the deadline for investigating and reporting the largest grain merchants in each county, reports have been successively submitted by the provincial government, the National Food Administration, and the county magistrates. After careful examination and evaluation of the reported number of households, the following are the handling methods approved: (1) For those who reported relatively well, Qijiang, Yongchuan, Ba County, Jiangjin, Hechuan, Jiang'an, Luxian, Xuyong, Fuling, Fengdu, Qu County, Guang'an, Linshui, Mianyang, Deyang, and other seventeen counties, in addition to the separate orders to commend the respective county magistrates, the provincial government should immediately record a major merit for each person to show encouragement. (2) Those who submitted non-compliant reports and performed the worst include Renshou, Neijiang, Nanchong, Xindu, Guan County, Ziyang, Weiyuan, Rongxian, Wushan, Pengshui, and other ten counties. The respective county magistrates, regarding (code unclear), work that should be centered on grain management, dared to be so perfunctory and negligent of orders, which is truly unforgivable. The provincial government should dismiss or record two major demerits for each county magistrate, taking into account their usual performance, to serve as a warning. In addition, after checking, it is hoped that the county magistrates of Chengdu, Zigong, Huayang, Xinjin, Zhaohua, Guanhan, Shuangliu, Bazhong, Hongya, Shehong, Zitong, Peng County, Pingshan, Mabian, Mingbian, Yunbo, Fushun, Zhongjiang, Tongnan, Suining, Santai, Guangyuan, Nanbu, Xichong, Lezhi, Xunzhi, Beichuan, Nanjiang, and other twenty-eight cities and counties, who have not reported in compliance with the order, should also be checked by the provincial government to see if they have reported to the government separately. If they have been reported, they should continue to be forwarded for approval; otherwise, they should also be investigated and dealt with according to the above, separately dismissing or recording demerits, and a deadline of ten days is given to supplement the report without delay. (3) Other counties have already been separately ordered by telegram. If there are any false reports, another deadline of half a month is given for self-correction and reporting; otherwise, if any false reports are found, they will be punished by military law. (4) All reported major households in each county should be handled by the county magistrates in accordance with the letter to the Sichuan provincial people, the instructions to the county magistrates, and the regulations of the National Food Administration, etc., to earnestly solicit donations and sales from major households and the people, and the end of January next year will be the date for comprehensive evaluation. At that time, those who have achieved truly outstanding results should select the most excellent individuals to be recorded and employed by the administrative commissioners, in order to show the intention of competition and encouragement." It is heard that after the investigation of grain merchants, there will be further control measures. Those who hoard grain or have surplus grain and do not sell should be warned. (24th telegram)

Yu Hoarding Merchants Feel Great Panic

Chongqing: Former Chengdu Mayor Yang Quanyu was sentenced to death by the military authorities for hoarding people's food and was executed by firing squad this morning at 8:00 a.m. in the main thoroughfare. The general public was full of praise. It is heard that several hardware and pigment merchants were arrested at the same time as Yang, also for the crime of hoarding and speculation, and are currently under interrogation. According to informed sources, the authorities will continue to severely punish hoarders, and pay particular attention to grain hoarders. According to the Ta Kung Pao, the authorities are cracking down on hoarding with lightning speed, and hoarding merchants are feeling panic. It is heard that a certain financier has already dumped a large quantity of cigarettes, and so-and-so also intends to dump hardware and electrical materials worth 20 million yuan. In addition, some hoarding merchants are fleeing to other counties and moving goods to the countryside, causing major commercial firms to become empty shops. However, the authorities will never let this go and are stepping up investigations. (23rd Havas telegram)

Government Improves Grain Production

Chongqing: Lu Zuofu, Director of the National Food Administration, recently stated that the food problem in the rear of China was greatly affected by the hoarding and speculation of unscrupulous merchants. Since the authorities executed the former Chengdu Mayor Yang Quanyu and punished many speculators, the trend of hoarding should be quickly curbed. The government is now actively improving grain production. For example, corn, which is a major food crop for farmers, will increase by 10 million dan in Sichuan Province next year. In addition, with high grain prices, farmers will inevitably expand their planting area and increase their harvest, so the food supply next year will be abundant and grain prices will inevitably fall. In addition, regarding the execution of Yang Quanyu, Chairman Chiang has recently issued a notice to all provinces, stating that it was handled in accordance with Article 7 of the Military Law, and all provinces should order their subordinate cities and county governments to be universally informed to serve as a warning.

### Chinese Army Achieves Attrition Warfare Goals, Small Clashes in Southern Shanxi, Chinese and Japanese Armies Confront Each Other in the Zhongtiao Mountains, All Important Passes Are in the Hands of the Chinese Army

Luoyang: According to a military observer who spoke to the Central News Agency reporter, since the beginning of winter, there have been no large-scale battles in the southern Shanxi battlefield, which is related to the overall situation in North China, but small clashes have not been interrupted until now, occurring two to three times a day, fully achieving the goal of Chinese attrition warfare. In the recent situation in southern Shanxi, the Chinese and Japanese armies confront each other in the Zhongtiao Mountains, forming an interlocking line, which is absolutely beneficial to us. The person mentioned Lishan as (1) the important passes of the Zhongtiao Mountains are under the control of our army; (2) the towns at the foot of the Zhongtiao Mountains, from Ruicheng in the west to Yongji in the east, are defended by the Chinese army; (3) on the contrary, the Japanese are in a difficult situation and cannot make progress. If they concentrate their forces to take a chance, the result will inevitably be small gains and large losses. Therefore, recently, they have changed their offensive to a defensive stance, actively engaged in road construction, strengthened fortifications, and blockaded traffic, etc., obviously adopting a passive defense. Moreover, in the future war situation in southern Shanxi, the Japanese army will inevitably be reduced to a disadvantage. As long as the Chinese command authorities seize favorable opportunities at any time and all officers and soldiers give full play to the strong characteristics of past battles and take the offensive, the Zhongtiao Mountains will not only be regarded as a blind intestine by the Japanese, but also become the starting point for the recovery of North China.

Chongqing: According to Huafang News, in order to unify anti-smuggling work, the Chinese government has specially established an Anti-Smuggling Bureau under the Ministry of Finance and appointed Dai Li as the director to preside over the matter. Preparations have now begun and it will be established soon. In the past, anti-smuggling work was handled separately by various customs offices and the Economic Committee of the War Zone and the Commodity Inspection Bureau, but due to the failure to unify powers, there has been a large amount of smuggling. The value of smuggled goods imported into the free zone each year reaches 400 million yuan.

### British Prime Minister Churchill Scathingly Denounces Mussolini for Ruining the Country; Violating the Pope's and the Nation's Aspirations for Peace; Turning British-Italian Friendship into Enmity, the Blame Lies with One Person

London: British Prime Minister Churchill gave a broadcast to Italy last night, scathingly denouncing Mussolini for disregarding the wishes of the King, the Pope, and the Italian people, and for plunging the country into war. He said that the British army is now tearing apart the Italian African empire, and that this was already happening at the beginning of the war, and the outcome in the future is even more unpredictable. Before Italy entered the war, it did not consult with its own people, nor did it consult with the army. The blame for this situation lies with one person. Mussolini, having been in power for sixteen years, has ultimately plunged the country into a dangerous situation, tarnished the dignity of the Italian royal family, disregarded the Pope and the leader of Catholicism, and violated the Italian people's desire for peace. This foolish act of ruining the country can only be attributed to this one person. The only reason Mussolini can cite for Italy's entry into the war is the old dispute over the treaties and territorial demands of Italy after the World War. You, the Italian people, were originally our friends and brothers, and the Italian army, have you ever been consulted by Mussolini? The only person Mussolini consulted with was Hitler. Mussolini chose to join the war when the situation in France was tense and Italy's neighbors were under great pressure, taking advantage of the opportunity. What is the situation of Italy today? You should know that now only this one person has to bear the brunt of the entire British Empire's firepower. The victories of the British army in Africa and the Greek army in Albania are evidence of the difficulties encountered by the Italian dictator. Britain and Italy were originally friendly countries, but current circumstances have forced Britain to fight against its old ally, which is a matter of great regret. British-Italian friendship has been ancient and enduring. Even in the last war, we were still friends, but fifteen years after the war, we are no longer friends. Although British-Italian relations have changed since the war, we could still walk together on the path of peace, and our people could still cooperate. But now that the war has begun, we have no choice but to fight for final victory. (Reuters report, 24th)

Berlin: A representative of Hitler's party broadcast a speech to the German people, saying that Christmas is the most solemn festival for the German people. This is the second Christmas since Germany entered the war. German soldiers have traveled far and wide, with their footprints covering Norway, France, Belgium, Holland, Denmark, and pre-war Poland. German officers are temporarily stationed in Romania on special missions. In addition, there are German soldiers and officers on warships and submarines in the Atlantic Ocean. Imagining their shared feelings in different places tonight, with bright lights and mutual celebrations, is truly a grand occasion. Hess also said that those who are completely forgotten after death are truly dead. The spirit of all the soldiers who died for the glory of Germany remains with us and can be said to be alive even after death. We are fighting in the west and cannot yet claim complete victory, but we firmly believe that after victory, it will benefit the peace of Europe and even the world. In just one year, the face of Europe has completely changed. In addition to changes in several countries, the power of Britain has been destroyed. Britain's sword in Europe (France) is now turned upside down and is no longer available for Britain's use. Conversely, the coast from Northern Europe to Spain is under German control. Moreover, the spoils captured in victory are piled up like mountains and can be used by the German army to defeat the enemy. Germany has regained countless naval and air bases, which can serve as stepping stones for attacking Britain. Its disadvantage to Britain is self-evident. In short, the German army has a firm belief in the leader and internationalism. Final victory will surely belong to us. (Haitong report, 24th)

We must concentrate our efforts to promote anything beneficial to the nation. We must do our best to destroy anything harmful. If every individual in the nation can embrace this resolve, national rejuvenation can be expected any day.

Honoring Loyalty, Upholding Righteousness

(2) "Honoring loyalty" is our nation's inherent virtue. Yue Fei, Wen Tianxiang, and others demonstrated their loyalty and patriotism by refusing to surrender. This was the core of their strength. The reason our nation has a history of thousands of years and has been able to revive after countless disasters is that it is based on this core idea. Now, morality is declining, and people betray righteousness for profit, which is heartbreaking. Therefore, to save the nation from crisis, we urgently need to revive traditional morality, honor loyalty, encourage each other among relatives and friends to preserve integrity, uphold the righteousness of the world, and plan for national rejuvenation.

Patriotic Leaflets Found Everywhere

Last night, in various locations throughout the city, such as the entrances of the Sun Sun Co., New World, Wing On Co., Sincere Co. on Nanjing Road, the Great World on Avenue Edward VII, and various movie theaters such as Grand Theatre, Nanking, Grand Shanghai, Cathay, New China, Shanghai, Central, and dance halls, young men and women distributed large quantities of five-colored leaflets. The contents included "Support Chairman Chiang," "Strive to Complete the Great Task of Resisting Aggression and National Reconstruction," and "Long Live Chinese National Rejuvenation." There were also various Western-language leaflets, mostly containing phrases like "Long Live China." People from all walks of life who picked them up eagerly read them, and their emotions were extremely excited.

### Two British Banks Entrusted to Maintain Foreign Exchange as Much as Possible; Market Rumors Proved Completely Baseless; Rejection of Various Banknotes Does Not Affect Shanghai

The national government is determined to maintain legal currency and stabilize exchange rates. The legal foreign exchange rate will remain unchanged and will be managed by the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Management Committee. The Shanghai financial market, due to the upcoming opening of a certain bank, caused speculators to revive their old tricks and spread rumors to make profits. The black market in foreign exchange was rampant. The HSBC and Chartered Bank, entrusted by the Hong Kong Equalization Committee, supplied as much as possible to maintain the black market. As a result, the black market exchange rate rose yesterday.

Change in People's Minds

The rumors in the Shanghai foreign exchange black market were caused by the upcoming opening of a certain bank, claiming that the Ministry of Finance would revise the commercial exchange rate, and that the Shanghai HSBC Bank would stop listing black market foreign exchange. Regarding the transfer of foreign exchange transactions to Hong Kong, the Chinese government stopped maintaining the Shanghai black market, creating profits for speculators. However, all of the above are unfounded rumors. The revision of the commercial exchange rate has been denied by the Central Bank. The HSBC Bank continues to list as usual, and the Chinese government continues to maintain it, which has already been proven by facts. Therefore, after the opening of the market yesterday, due to the HSBC listing remaining unchanged, people's minds changed.

Combating Arbitrage

After the sudden volatility of the local black market finance the day before yesterday, the situation yesterday stabilized. According to the Pingming News Agency, yesterday, the authority of the well-informed financial community revealed that the tightening of foreign exchange is a necessary countermeasure to combat arbitrage. The banking community, both Chinese and foreign, now unanimously believes that the Chinese government will maintain the supply of foreign exchange to legitimate merchants in the future. The foreign exchange fund of the Equalization Fund Committee is, in fact, very sufficient, but whenever there is a large amount of arbitrage, it has to be tightened and combated.

Rejecting Various Banknotes

Regarding the strict implementation of the ban on unauthorized new banknotes, the Ministry of Finance has decided on concrete measures. In addition to issuing notices to chambers of commerce and trade associations in various regions, ordering them to unanimously refuse to accept and use them, it has also reached an agreement with friendly banks in Shanghai to refuse to accept them and not engage in related transactions. Therefore, if these banknotes are issued, they will not have a significant impact on Shanghai's entire finance. It is heard that the friendly banks, members of the Shanghai Foreign Bankers' Association, as well as Chinese banks and money shops, will refuse to accept these new banknotes and will not deal with the banks that issue them.

### American World Class New Ship to Sail to Shanghai on Schedule

It is currently loading cargo in New York and is scheduled to leave New York on Saturday after a simple ceremony for its maiden voyage. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai on February 6. It is found that the President Company's original old ship, the President Monroe, has been sailing the Far East for 20 years. Recently, it arrived in New York and was renamed President Buchanan, to be kept for emergency use.

### Nine People Implicated in Japanese Police Officer Stabbing Case

On the night of the 20th of this month, around 11 PM, a Japanese police officer named Miyazaki Satoshi was suddenly stabbed to death with a blade on Wenmiao Road in Nanshi. The brief situation has been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, the truth of the case was officially announced. It is said that the stabbed Japanese police officer, Miyazaki Satoshi, 31 years old, was a police officer of the Nanshi dispatch station of the Japanese Consulate Police Department. At 8:30 PM that day, he was dispatched to Nanshi to investigate a theft case. Unexpectedly, at the scene of the incident, three criminals suddenly attacked him from behind with sharp blades. Miyazaki Satoshi also turned around to fight, but was stabbed all over his body, with a total of 15 cuts. It is also said that nine suspects were arrested afterward.

### Civilians Refused Rice Purchases at Fixed Prices; Authorities Announce No Rice Shortage; Rice Evaluation Committee Sets Rice Prices Yesterday; Public Warehouse Rice Storage Proposal Approved Yesterday

According to the Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury, with rice prices soaring, Shanghai residents unexpectedly faced a serious difficulty today (the 24th), because several rice shops refused to sell rice unless the selling price exceeded the price limit set by the Rice Evaluation Committee. Those who tried to buy rice at the fixed price were uniformly told by the rice shops that they had no rice to sell. However, those who secretly paid a few yuan more per picul, exceeding the price limit, could still purchase large quantities of rice. This afternoon, the Shanghai Municipal Council specially convened rice merchants to a meeting to fully review this issue. Some believe that rice merchants may negotiate with parties to transport rice from areas outside the concessions to alleviate the situation. Observers say that there is plenty of rice in storage in the concessions, so there should be no rice shortage.

Setting Rice Prices

The Shanghai Rice Evaluation Committee, due to the continued illicit trading of rice and rising prices, held an emergency meeting at 10 AM yesterday at the Soy and Rice Merchants' Association on Avenue Edward VII. All members of the Evaluation Committee attended, with Chairman Chen Ziyi reporting on the rice market situation. They then evaluated the price per picul of rice not fixed on the 9th of this month: (1) Siamese Rice No. 1 at 89 yuan, (2) Annam Rice Luc at 78 yuan, (3) Saigon Mixed Broken No. 1 and 2 at 76 yuan, (4) High-Quality Tokyo Rice at 79 yuan, (5) Tokyo Brown Rice at 75 yuan. They also evaluated the price per bag as follows: (1) Saigon Rice No. 1 at 104.5 yuan, (2) Saigon Rice No. 2 at 98 yuan, (3) Small Milled Rice at 97 yuan, Saigon Mixed Broken Rice No. 1 and 2 at 91 yuan. The rice prices fixed on the 9th of this month remain the same: Saigon Rice No. 1 at 87 yuan, Saigon Rice No. 2 at 81.5 yuan, Siamese Rice No. 2 at 80 yuan, High-Quality Small Milled Rice at 86 yuan, Small Milled Rice at 79 yuan.

French Announcement

Yesterday, the French Concession authorities announced: "According to the Rice Committee of the Municipal Council, (1) the Governor-General of Indochina has issued regulations to maintain the effectiveness of the Saigon rice control, prohibiting the delivery of goods in place of rice when delivering ordered rice. Therefore, the tonnage of top-quality rice that was temporarily banned from export in December cannot be replaced by the same tonnage of No. 2 rice, but it can be delivered in February. (2) It is planned to ship at least 100,000 bags of Saigon rice to Shanghai in January to maintain the balance of rice storage in Shanghai. Based on the current amount of rice in storage in Shanghai and the amount of rice shipped from Saigon or other places before February 1, there is no need to worry about the food supply for Shanghai residents. Saigon will have new rice shipped out in February, so there is no fear of a shortage. The restriction on Saigon rice exports this time is entirely to prevent the exhaustion of old rice, so it is planned to lift this restriction in February. In short, there is no fear of a rice shortage in Shanghai."

Public Warehouse Meeting

The Public Works Department of the Shanghai International Settlement invited leaders of various industries to a meeting at the conference hall of the department yesterday (24th) afternoon to discuss the establishment of public warehouses. After discussion, (1) 200,000 bags of foreign rice will be purchased to establish a public warehouse. Those who pledged to purchase on the spot include Yu Qiaqing 30,000 bags, the rice and grain industry 60,000 bags, the banking industry 50,000 bags, the yarn industry 20,000 bags, the flour industry 10,000 bags, the coal industry 5,000 bags, the new medicine and pharmaceutical industry 2,500 bags, the cotton industry 2,000 bags, the cotton cloth industry 2,000 bags, the sugar industry 1,500 bags, the hardware industry 1,500 bags, the wool industry 1,000 bags, the construction industry 500 bags, and the timber industry 500 bags, totaling 186,500 bags. The remaining 13,500 bags will be allocated by the cigarette industry and department stores, and the deficit will still be purchased by Yu Qiaqing. (2) A public warehouse management committee will be established, with nine members responsible for the overall management. The candidates are Yu Qiaqing, Xu Jilong (representing the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce), Wang Yuqing (representing the flour industry), He Dekui, two representatives from the banking industry, two representatives from the rice industry, and one representative from the yarn industry. It was also decided that the two concession Public Works Departments will each send one representative to supervise the committee. The representatives of the banking industry, rice industry, and yarn industry will be appointed within three days and reported to the Public Works Department. As soon as the committee members are complete, the first meeting of the committee will be held immediately to discuss all matters. (3) The management of the above public warehouse will be centralized in one place. Sales accounts will be announced monthly, and profits and losses will be distributed to the public accounts. The current foreign accountant (Thomson & Co), who audits the accounts of the Public Works Department, will be entrusted to audit the accounts every three months.

### Slowdown at Xinsheng and Xinyu Textile Factories; Shanghai West Textile Workers Also Make Demands; Labor Disputes Arise One After Another

According to the Continental Daily News, yesterday (the 23rd), labor sources said that 3,000 workers at two textile factories in the city had a dispute with the factory owners. If it is not resolved immediately, all textile workers in Shanghai may express sympathy and strike. If so, all textile factories will be closed. The above two textile factories are the Xinsheng Textile Factory on Tokyo Road and the Xinyu Textile Factory on Suzhou Road. The workers made demands to the factory owners more than a month ago, but did not receive a response, so they slowed down work on Sunday night.

Leading Workers Arrested

The two factory owners, fearing that the workers would take drastic action after the slowdown, requested assistance from the Shanghai Municipal Police Department. The police dispatched armored vehicles and police cars to protect the factories and arrested ten workers who incited the strike. According to labor sources, those arrested were repeatedly questioned by the police and have not yet been released. People from the two textile factories said that the workers did not declare a strike, so a complete resolution is still possible.

Shanghai West Textile Factories Affected

At the same time, it is rumored that other textile factories (mostly in Shanghai West) are also showing signs of unrest. It is expected that more than 100,000 workers in various textile factories will demand increased wages and rice subsidies, threatening to strike. Yesterday, work at the Xinsheng and Xinyu factories was completely stopped. Labor sources said that work would not resume until the factory owners agreed to the workers' demands.

Knitting Technicians

In addition, approximately 1,000 knitting factory technicians in Shanghai have been on strike for several days. Their representatives continued negotiations with the employers yesterday. Well-informed sources said that a resolution is expected soon. It is heard that 20,000 workers in the knitting industry have expressed sympathy for the technicians' strike, so the factory owners are eager to resolve the dispute immediately.

Movers and Automobile Workers Demand

The daily-hired workers in Shanghai's sofa industry have made demands to their employers, but most have not been approved, so they were still on strike yesterday, and it is feared that it will not be easy to resolve. More than 1,000 workers at the Shanghai Moving Automobile Company made requests to the employers last week to increase wages and rice subsidies. The workers' representatives believe they do not need to strike because the employers are likely to comply with the workers' demands, with only slight modifications.

Textile Workers' Demands Strong

Also, according to the Shanghai Times, it was reported yesterday that 300,000 members of the West District Textile Workers' Union have recently made several demands for increased wages and improved treatment to the textile factory owners. It is the first time in many years that an organized workers' union has directly negotiated with employers to protect workers' interests. The union's demands were issued in the form of a "final notice," with strong wording, stating that if the demands are rejected, the union reserves the right to take action.

Various Other Parties Request Pay Raises

Three thousand barbers in the two concessions also demanded increased wages and improved treatment from their employers yesterday. A labor dispute occurred at the Fuzhan Flour Mill on Moganshan Road, and labor and management are still in consultation. Some of the workers who went on strike last week have now returned to work, while the remaining workers are still on strike, waiting for the factory to announce new wages. Also, postal employees submitted several demands to Director-General Chappellin last Saturday and Sunday. They continued to work as usual yesterday, awaiting a response from the Yunnan Postal Administration.

Inaccurate Report of Public Bus Revenue Increase

The British-owned China General Omnibus Company recently increased fares by 35% starting on the 17th of this month due to rising prices and increased expenses, in order to increase revenue. Afterward, there were rumors that the company's daily revenue could increase from 50,000 yuan to 67,500 yuan. It is learned from reliable sources that the so-called increase in revenue is purely speculative and unreliable.

Rotary Club Postpones Regular Meeting This Week

The Shanghai Rotary Club's regular meeting this week has been postponed to December 27 (Friday) at noon at the Cathay Hotel for a closed-door meeting to introduce new members. Mr. Hudspeth, a member who recently returned from Vietnam, will give a speech on "Impressions of Vietnam." The club's next regular meeting will also be held on Friday, at the same time and location as above. Mr. Prinold will present his personal hobby home movie and etc.

### Christmas Eve

— Wei Yajun

It's Christmas again. Although I've never sung hymns like "Our Lord Jesus," I won't miss the chance to join the festivities, especially since the air on the "isolated island" is so suffocating!

As soon as the numbers on the calendar hit December, the windows of department stores and candy stores are filled with the footprints of white-bearded, red-robed Santa Clauses. The cotton-lined backgrounds are so clean and pure, and the luxurious gifts in the "Lucky Bags" are so tempting. If your eyes have a moment to linger on them, you'll subconsciously start counting the days until Christmas, or even calculate the exact day of the week. You've already made up your mind—you'll set aside a certain percentage of this month's salary (maybe even the double pay and unexpected bonus!) to spend on this "festive season." You think this way, your friends think this way, and your relatives certainly think this way too.

This bleak season suddenly becomes lively and bright. Beautiful window displays cover up the squalor of the street children. The hurried footsteps ignore the "corpses lying on the road." And those cheerful emotions naturally fail to notice the countless faces of sorrow in this great city!

"Merry Christmas" and X'Mas Sales are in full swing, extending this "festive season" all the way to last night.

This evening feels like meeting a long-lost lover, and like finding a place to entrust my soul. In the movie theaters, giant films celebrating the holiday are showing. Laurel and Hardy make you laugh until you can't close your mouth, and "The Breeze Through the Half-Open Door" is such a tender and romantic love story! In the restaurants, fruit platters adorned with red and purple ribbons are paired with silver cutlery. The bubbles in the champagne reflect smiling faces, and the warm air in the heated rooms is just as pleasant as springtime, right? In the dance halls, elegant "ladies" are putting on a fashion exhibition just like you see in Hollywood movies. Jazz music and Hawaiian love songs spin wildly from the microphones, "Why not be merry?"

In short, there is no time, no world, and no loss of life here!

But dawn finally seeps through the lace-trimmed curtains, and it is the people who were neglected by this group of souls that send them home—

The days have progressed for another day, and the labor of these people is pushing the mechanisms of the entire city.

### Passenger Attempts Murder for Money in Grand Shanghai Hotel; Yang Le'an Stabbed Twice; Assailant Apprehended on the Spot

At around 3:10 PM yesterday afternoon, an attempted murder for money occurred in room 605 of the Grand Shanghai Hotel near the Dongxin Bridge in the French Concession. Fortunately, the waiter heard the commotion and entered the room, apprehending the assailant on the spot and turning him over to the police for investigation. The details are as follows:

Door Shut Tight, Chatting Merrily

Yesterday afternoon around 1:00 PM, two passengers arrived at the Grand Shanghai Hotel at 343 Dongxin Bridge. They were wearing dark coats and carrying bags. They were led to room 605 on the sixth floor, with a daily rate of 11 yuan. They paid 50 yuan in legal tender and registered under the name Yang Le'an from Suzhou, a 38-year-old businessman. After the waiter brought tea, they closed the door and chatted merrily. Around 3:00 PM, they called waiter number eight (Lu Chuanxian from Yangzhou, in his thirties) to buy two plates of Nanxiang dumplings.

Assailant Attempts Escape, Waiter Apprehends

When Lu returned with the dumplings, he heard cries for help coming from the room. He put down the dumplings and rushed inside. The door was slightly opened, and the assailant immediately fled. The waiter apprehended him on the spot and saw that Yang Le'an had been stabbed twice in the left corner of his forehead and face, with blood gushing out. The injuries were severe, and a sharp blade was abandoned on the floor. He immediately reported the incident to the relevant Mulan police station, which quickly dispatched Chinese and Western detectives. The assailant was taken to the police station, and the weapon was kept as evidence. It is reported that the assailant's name is Xu Ze, 21 years old, from Suzhou, wearing a blue cloth long gown. He arrived in Shanghai with the victim yesterday morning to purchase goods and planned to stay in Shanghai for a short time. He saw that the victim had a lot of legal tender and was tempted to kill him, take the money, and flee. He confessed to everything.

Eyeball Protruding, Possibly Becoming Disabled

When the reporter arrived to investigate, he saw that the copper bed in the room was leaning, and the mat had fallen to the ground, suggesting that the victim may have been lying on the bed when the assailant attacked, resulting in a violent struggle. The mattress and floor were covered in bloodstains, and three five-cent nickel coins were left on the glass table. It is reported that the injured victim was rushed to the Guangci Hospital by ambulance for treatment. His left eyeball has already protruded and may become disabled.

### Lawsuit Over 240,000 Yuan Leather Clothing Concluded

Zhou Pengling (22 years old this year), the grandson of the late salt industry tycoon Zhou Fuli, previously retained a lawyer to file a complaint with the civil court of the Special District Court, accusing his elder brother's widow, Zhou Mei, of requesting a judgment to return 23 boxes of leather clothing. If the original items cannot be returned, please order compensation of 240,000 yuan in national currency. The case has been heard in court several times, and the presiding judge personally conducted an inspection and hired experts to appraise the prices. The details have been reported in the previous newspaper. Yesterday, another continued hearing was held. The court ordered a debate because the case was clear. The attorneys for the plaintiff, Shan Yuhua and Ling Changyan, and the attorneys for the defendant debated fiercely. The court debate was concluded, and the sentence is scheduled to be pronounced on the morning of the 28th of this month.

### Ticket Inspector Forbes' Left Leg Crushed

According to the North-China Daily News, a Westerner named Forbes, who works as a ticket inspector for the British-owned tram company, had his left leg crushed yesterday (the 23rd) at 2:15 PM. Forbes was working on a tram. When he got off the tram at the intersection of Gansu Road and Haining Road, it was raining and the road was slippery. Forbes lost his footing and fell to the ground. The tram was already slowly moving, causing Forbes' left leg to be run over and crushed by the wheel. The driver quickly braked, but it was too late. An ambulance was called to rush Forbes to the Hong'en Hospital for treatment.

### Cruel Stepmother Expels Son; Sentence Scheduled for 28th

According to the Shewen News Agency, Chen Jianbai from Zhenhai, who resides in room 7 of the Xinchang Customs Brokerage at 48 Jinjiang Street and works as a "clerk" in the "Unified Tax Bureau," remarried after his first wife died. His new wife is fierce and considers the children of his first wife as thorns in her eyes. She recently expelled his third son, Binquan (14 years old), and his twelfth-year-old fourth son from the house, causing the two children to wander the streets. Although Chen knew about it, he was too weak to argue. The two children fell ill on Robert Sheng Road yesterday. The public hospital at 88 Robert Sheng Road learned of this, felt pity for them, and took them in for treatment.

### Criminal Cases Suspended for Christmas

Today and tomorrow are the Western Christmas holiday. The Municipal Council is closed for two days as usual, so the criminal cases sent by the police to the Special District Court will also be suspended for two days and will resume on the 27th.

### Scheme to Kidnap Wealthy Merchant Zheng Jiwei, Demand 100,000 Yuan Ransom; 26 Culprits Apprehended, Guns and Bullets Seized, Six Admit to Kidnapping Plot

The Central Police Station, late on the 19th of last month, ordered detectives, along with personnel from the French Concession Police Affairs Office, to apprehend a total of 26 kidnapping suspects, including Jin Fu, Pan Tao Tao, and Cao Bosheng, all from Zhenhai, at hotels such as the Xin Shenghuo Hotel on Avenue Mutiny. They seized a pistol, 43 bullets, and two fake guns. The suspects were taken to the First Special District Court for detention. During the continued hearing yesterday morning, the police stated that six of the defendants—Jin Fu, Pan Tao Tao, Cao Bosheng, Lu Genrong, Ding Agen, and Qin Haixiang—had already confessed to planning the kidnapping of wealthy merchant Zheng Jiwei and demanding a ransom of 100,000 national currency. Therefore, they were initially charged with attempted kidnapping. The presiding judge was on leave due to personal matters and was replaced by Judge Zhong, who presided over the First Criminal Court and issued an order for a postponement of the trial.

Social Miscellany

Anhui natives Gao Wensheng and his wife, Gao Pengshi, rented a house at 155 Guizhou Road this spring, where they bought young girls and forced them into prostitution for profit. This was recently discovered by Hua Detective Zhang Ziqing of the Old Zha Police Station's Flower Donation Squad. On the 9th of this month, they raided the address and arrested Gao and his wife, along with accomplice Zhu Shuzhen, and rescued two girls in distress, Zhu Baolan and Gao Meimei. They were handed over to the First Special District Court for prosecution. The trial has already concluded, and Judge Zhong delivered the verdict yesterday morning. Gao Wensheng and Gao Pengshi were each sentenced to two years in prison for jointly intending to profit by luring innocent girls into forced prostitution. Zhu Shuzhen, as an accomplice, was sentenced to six months. The victims were sent to the Ji Liang Institute for care. Zhang Agen, a thief from Pudong, along with several fugitive accomplices, broke into the home of Gao Guangwen at 10, Lane 575, Taopeng Road, on the morning of the 5th of last month around 10 AM, and robbed them at gunpoint. He was apprehended by the Yulin Road Police Station and handed over to the First Special District Court. Judge Fu delivered the verdict yesterday morning, sentencing Zhang Agen to seven years in prison for being a habitual armed robber. Chen Xuezhi, a 23-year-old Shanghai native residing at 46 Zhuanbang, Xizhuanbang Road, Yidingpan Road, embezzled a massive 39,240 yuan of national currency from Hodges foreign firm due to gambling debts he could not repay. The manager discovered this, reported it to the police, and sent detectives to arrest Chen. He was sent to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District Court yesterday morning. Judge Zhong Qing issued an order for his detention and scheduled a review in one week.

The Old Zha Police Station, acting on a report, ordered Chinese and foreign detectives to arrest sixteen suspected male and female thieves, including Fu Sheng, Zhang Damei, and Zhu Xiuzhen, in Room 12 of the Henan Hotel on Henan Road and Room 13 of the Yuandan Hotel opposite the Greater West Boundary on Avenue Edward VII at around 11 PM last night, seizing a pistol.

### Food: Imported Rice Limits Further Relaxed; However, Black Market Prices Already High, Results May Still Lead to Higher Surcharges; Over 30,000 Bags of Saigon Rice Arrive, Proving Embargo Inaccurate

Yesterday's rice market was once again in a state of frenzy. Although restricted goods were not generally seen, unrestricted goods were exceptionally brisk. Due to today being the anniversary of the Yunnan Uprising and the market being closed as usual, local shops and warehouses were all adding to their reserves as a precautionary measure, leading to a sudden surge in buying. This caused the price of imported rice to rise by another two or three yuan. However, the official price limit was not broken on the surface, although the practice of surcharges became more prevalent, rising from 500-600 yuan to 700-800 yuan per hundred bags. Various mixed rice types saw less trading due to speculators not paying much attention, but prices were raised by one or two yuan or three or four yuan. In particular, broken pointed rice was the most expensive, at 81 yuan. The original Yinghua Company bags were priced the same as Milu rice. Yesterday, the authorities supplemented the price limits, calculating the spot price for Saigon No. 1 at 104 yuan, No. 2 at 98 yuan, Xiaowen at 97 yuan, Milu rice at 78 yuan, and broken rice at 76 yuan. They also prevented brokers from entering the market in order to implement the ban. However, the spot price for Saigon No. 1 in original bags had already reached 110 yuan yesterday, broken rice was 81.5 yuan, and Milu rice was 83.5 yuan, far exceeding the price limits. In the future, buying and selling may require many more surcharges. Under the publicity of the Saigon embargo and price fixing being inaccurate, a new fact of refutation emerged yesterday. A new deal had been struck for 2,000 tons of Saigon No. 1. He Yi sold it, with shipment in the latter half of January, at a price of 102.6 yuan. Back-to-back transactions saw lively speculation, with 1,200-1,300 tons changing hands, and spot transactions reached 14,000-15,000 bags.

Imported rice continued to arrive yesterday. The French Company (SSGR GL AVARENNE) ship, directly from Saigon, transported over 30,000 bags, arriving in Shanghai yesterday afternoon and docking at the Shun Tai Wharf in Hongkou for unloading. Also, the Taikoo Company's Sichuan ship, loaded with 651 bags from Hong Kong, arrived in port yesterday morning, docking in Pudong and scheduled to move to the company's wharf on the Bund in the French Concession today for unloading.

Since the supply of thick and thin japonica rice and other domestic rice types has not been strong, and the sales market generally feels that purchasing imported rice is not easy, with daily prices being nearly the same, many have switched to promoting japonica rice, leading to a sudden surge in demand and a corresponding increase in sales prices of two yuan. Kunshan hulled white japonica is priced between 100 and 103 yuan, Qingjiao thin-husk rice is priced between 91 and 93 yuan, and original bags are at 98 yuan.

Glutinous rice suddenly tightened yesterday, as it usually has a small sales volume and a lower price than other goods. With the current environment of rejection towards imported rice, people have turned their attention to glutinous rice, leading to purchases from many sides and a sudden price surge of one or two yuan in the market. Yili white yuan is priced at 98 yuan, and Hong Kong white yuan is between 84.5 and 86.7 yuan, etc.

### Flour Market Continues to Rise - Imported Flour Has Become a Speculative Tool

Flour prices continued to rise yesterday as hoarders searched and purchased with every effort, and importers raised prices regardless. Zhonglou and Huaniao brand Australian flour reached a new high of 22.8 yuan. Yezhu and Meili brands both broke the 23 yuan mark, a considerable increase. However, due to the Christmas holiday, hoarders released some stock, and the price of Huaniao brand loosened from 22.8 yuan to 22.45 yuan, ending up similar to the previous day's highest price. Total market transactions were over 20,000 bags, and the underlying market remained stable.

Wheat remained firm and brisk yesterday, with flour mills feeling a lack of raw materials and naturally buying eagerly. However, the supply is currently scarce, and there is no stock to buy. It is reported that the Hua Mill received over 200 bags of wheat from the suburbs at a price of 32.5 yuan, and the asking price has already exceeded 33 yuan, so the market remains firm.

### Finance: Rumors Proven Unfounded; Foreign Exchange Returns to Tranquility

Yesterday's foreign exchange situation saw no changes in HSBC's listed prices. The black market exchange rates for British and American currencies rebounded, and the market situation was somewhat calm. There were no more substantiated news reports, and speculators' fabrications came to an end. Speculators who profited in today's morning session had already sold, and other transactions were taking place. HSBC and other foreign banks provided ample supplies of shillings and US dollars. By noon, the market had already begun to break down. In the afternoon, the Bank of Japan began selling, causing a particularly strong situation. At one point, the US dollar dropped by half a yuan, but speculators were still buying cheaply, causing the market to close at the same level. The spot price for shillings was reported at 3 pence 4375, and the US dollar was 5 yuan 4375, up 0.03125 from the previous day's British increase, and the US dollar loosening by 0.09375. The next three days are holidays for Chinese and foreign banks, and the market will be closed as usual.

Foreign Banks Offer Large Amounts

At the beginning of the morning, London large transactions, both near-term and forward, rose by 0.0625. New York banks remained flat. London gold remained stable. The exchange rate between Shanghai and the British pound was unchanged, while the exchange rate between the US dollar and the British pound sought more, and the exchange rate with Shanghai fell by 0.26 yuan. There were no prices for French currency. Central listed exchange rates remained the same. Foreign banks opened the spot selling price in the morning, with British gold at 3 pence 375 and the US dollar at 5 yuan 375, tighter by 0.03125 compared to the previous night's close for British currency, while the US dollar tightened by 0.03125. After opening, the market became unstable again as speculators came to buy. It is estimated that American banks sold US dollars for the next month at 5 yuan 34375. At 9:30 AM, HSBC listed exchange rates remained unchanged, but thereafter, HSBC and McCallum supplied approximately 100,000 pounds of shillings, slightly loosening the potential situation. It is estimated that foreign banks entered spot shillings at 3 pence 40625, and the US dollar also saw a rebound. It is estimated that Huabi Bank absorbed US dollars for the next month at 5 yuan 40625. By noon, speculators entered the market to sell, and the market continued to tighten. It is estimated that speculators sold US dollars to HSBC for this month at 5 yuan 4 yuan 75. The afternoon closing saw little change, with the spot price for shillings at 3 yuan 4375 and the US dollar at 5 yuan 4375.

Japanese Banks Also Seeking Sales

After the afternoon session opened, Japanese banks sought to sell, loosening the situation further. It is estimated that Zhengjin offered US dollars for this month at 5 yuan, but many speculators took the opportunity to buy, causing the trend to stabilize. Traders bought US dollars for this month from foreign banks, also at 5 yuan. Subsequently, as speculators continued to need purchases, the trend returned to flat. It is estimated that foreign banks entered US dollars for the next month at 5 yuan 4375, and US dollars for this month at 5 yuan 46875. As a result, the evening closing saw spot and this month's British gold at 3 pence 4375 and the US dollar at 5 yuan 4375, with next month's British gold at 3 pence 40625 and the US dollar at 5 yuan 40625, up 0.03125 for British gold and down 0.09375 for the US dollar compared to the previous day's closing.

Tianjin Exchange Market Weakens

Tianjin, 24th (Tuesday) Telegram: The exchange market opened sluggishly today. London telegram weakened, 203125, for 3 pence 8125. New York telegram shrank by 34375, for 6 yuan 03125. Shanghai exchange rose by 5 jiao, for 89 yuan. "Cash" slightly rose by 2.5 jiao, for 80 yuan 5 jiao.

Hong Kong Shanghai Exchange Falls

Hong Kong, 24th (Tuesday) Telegram: This morning, the market opened flat, remaining unchanged. British, American, and Japanese exchanges saw no ups or downs. Spot Shanghai exchange fell by 1 yuan, to 434 yuan (yesterday it rose to 435 yuan). At 11:30, the market was flat, with spot Shanghai exchange recovering slightly by 2 yuan, to 436 yuan. At 2:50 PM, the market opened flat, with spot Shanghai exchange falling again by 4 yuan, to 432 yuan. The record remained unchanged.

### Profit-Taking Leads to Selling; Gold Prices Slightly Rebound; Once Fell to 6,440 Yuan

Yesterday's gold market saw a slight rebound in the black market after initially declining, with prices entering the 6,600 yuan mark, once even breaking the 6,500 yuan mark. While rumors have subsided somewhat, people are still uneasy. However, large holders, securities firms, gold shops, and a certain bank's Shanghai West bullish company have already started selling to take profits. From the morning opening at 6,600 yuan, the market was hit by selling, and prices continued to fall by 80 yuan. However, after the large increase, the residual effects are inevitable, and small money shops increased their purchases, briefly lifting the market to 6,680 yuan. However, as foreign exchange reports loosened, cash shops also began to sell, and the upward trend soon ended. Prices gradually fell, and in the afternoon, as the US dollar strengthened to 5.53125 yuan, remittance houses and banks sold off, intensifying the selling pressure and pushing prices down to a low of 6,440 yuan. Seeing the low prices, buyers became active, and another cash shop's increase lifted prices by 150 yuan, eventually reaching 6,570 yuan, a decrease of 45 yuan. Based on the closing price of the one-month forward US dollar at 5.40625 yuan, the price was 6,462 yuan, an increase of 100.08 yuan. Total trading volume for the day was 15,000 taels. Cash prices were initially the same as forward prices, but later dropped by 3-5 yuan. No trading opened for futures. The minimum listed price for jewelry gold was 660 yuan, later rising to 670 yuan, a decrease of 5 yuan. Customs gold and other items remained flat. Today is the anniversary of the Yunnan Uprising, and Chinese and foreign banks are closed. Tomorrow is the foreign winter solstice, and foreign merchant banks will continue to be closed for another day. Therefore, both the gold market and the foreign exchange market will be closed for two days.

Black Market Falls by 45 Yuan

The morning started quietly. Gold shops offered 20 taels to banks at 6,600 yuan, 15 yuan lower than the previous day's closing. Soon, banks aggressively sold off, and Shanghai West bullish companies sold to realize profits, causing a drop of 80 yuan. Securities firms offered 20 taels to banks at 6,520 yuan. However, soon after, some positive rumors arose in the market, and money exchange businesses initiated a buying spree, unexpectedly lifting prices to the previous day's high. Money exchange businesses entered 20 taels to gold shops at 6,680 yuan. Later, hearing that foreign exchange loosened, cash shops came to the market to sell, and prices fell again. Banks offered 30 taels to securities firms at 6,530 yuan. At noon, retail investors searched for bargains, stopping the decline and rebounding. Banks entered 20 taels to securities firms at 6,585 yuan. At the close, banks offered 30 taels to gold shops at 6,560 yuan. After the afternoon session opened, selling was lurking due to the continued strength of the foreign exchange market, and sentiment was weak. Banks traded 20 taels, for 6,520 yuan. Later, with the help of bank purchases, prices briefly rose to 6,550 yuan, but as banks and certain firms exerted heavy selling pressure, support was limited, and prices were eventually pushed down to a low of 6,440 yuan. However, soon after, a major player in a gold shop strongly entered the market, causing a leap and rebounding to 6,590 yuan, eventually closing at 6,570 yuan, 45 yuan lower than the previous day. The selling price of the cash shop's own brand of gold was more than 10 yuan higher than the black market price, and the buying price was 30 yuan lower. The current standard gold price was 50-60 yuan lower than the listed gold price, but no trading opened.

Jewelry Gold Listed Down 5 Yuan

The selling price of jewelry gold per tael in silver shops was unchanged in the morning. At 2 PM, it was 5 yuan lower, and at 3 PM, it was another 10 yuan lower, before rising again by 10 yuan at 4 PM. As a result, Datong Heng County was 670 yuan, and Xin Tong Heng was similar to the above price, with buying prices 30 yuan lower.

### Discount Rate Soars

Yesterday's discount rate for foreign exchange and bill transactions suddenly soared. The discount on every 1,000 yuan reached as high as 6.5 yuan, and the discount rate was 6 yuan, an increase of 4 yuan from the previous day. The interest rate for the Wire Industry Association was quoted down by one point, at 6 points in both the morning and afternoon sessions.

### US Currency Slightly Declines

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw the black market price fluctuate rapidly, eventually trending slightly weaker. The British Gold Pound and the English Pound each declined by one yuan. The price of the English Gold Note remained unchanged, and the market price remained flat. The price of the US Dollar Note retreated to 18.3 yuan, eventually rising to 18.6 yuan, a final decrease of 2.5 jiao compared to the previous day. Demand for Hong Kong Cai Xuyao remained strong, rising to 4.35 yuan in the evening market. Canadian and Philippine notes tended to weaken slightly. The Japanese Gold Note fell after initially increasing, finally falling by 5 li, with the evening market at 1.615 yuan. The supply and demand for Korean Notes was balanced, and the evening market remained at the original price of 1.33 yuan.

### Securities: Bond Market Remains Listless

The black market for government bonds opened weakly yesterday. Shengda, Hongda, and other bulls sold off, and after Xie Kang covered over 100,000 shorts, the market price remained unchanged. Subsequently, as Tongkang bought 400,000 and Shunchang bought 100,000 of the Ding kind, and Lianyi also slightly hedged, but a multitude of bulls in the surname Chang traded heavily, and Dingkang also sold off the Yi kind, the market price was slightly abnormal. As a result, the Bing kind was slightly better by 5 points due to short covering, while the rest declined slightly by one or two jiao. Ninety-six were called for a small jiao. In the current environment, the future is not easy to be optimistic about. Turnover for half the day was approximately 1.4-1.5 million yuan. (The afternoon was used for settling the day's transactions and the market was closed, as the 25th and 26th are Christmas holidays and there will be no market.) The list is shown on the left.

Stock transactions: 200 shares of Zhabei Water and Electricity stock were traded at a price of 9.25 yuan.

Also, at the stock market of the Public Industry Association, prices trended downward as excessive bulls sold off. Foreign exchange fluctuated sharply, and stock prices rose and fell accordingly, but eventually weakened. This was probably also due to the approaching holidays. Rubber stocks fluctuated abnormally, rising and falling with the foreign exchange market. Trading volume for all stocks was significant throughout the day.

London, 23rd (Monday) Telegram: Today, the listed prices of Chinese foreign debts and stocks of various Far East British companies were generally flat. Stock prices saw very little fluctuation. Oriental Bank shares rose by 2 shillings and 6 pence, priced at 10 pounds 17 shillings and 6 pence. Gulakling rubber shares fell by 8.5 pence, to 15 shillings and 3 pence. The rest were unchanged.

### Yarn and Cotton: Many Firms Release Large Amounts; Yarn Prices Slightly Decline

The yarn and cloth market, which soared the previous day, returned to calm and retreated slightly. This was because the foreign exchange market shrank sharply and then strengthened slightly. As a result, bears became active again and sold off. At the same time, some firms gradually released large amounts, signaling a bearish outlook. Therefore, insiders are generally not bullish and are quick to sell when opportunities arise. As for "foreign customers," it is said that they sell slightly when prices are high and buy when prices are low. Both sides are pulling and tugging, with fewer sales and more purchases. It is conceivable that the contention between both sides is fierce. However, actual demand is more active than before, and the price of miscellaneous brands of yarn is also gradually increasing. Yesterday, 135 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.

Shuangma yarn opened in the morning due to the panic of the short side in the afternoon of the previous day, and the price was raised to cover shorts, reaching 1,412 yuan. Continuing the market atmosphere of the previous day, the price of 20-count Shuangma yarn was 1,400 yuan, rising directly to 1,409 yuan. As some profit-takers sold off, prices suddenly fell to within 1,400 yuan. Subsequently, hearing that foreign exchange had slightly risen, prices weakened again to 1,390 yuan. However, as soon as the low price appeared, covering shorts and purchases from various sides followed, rebounding to 1,407 yuan. However, some firms sold off Shuangma yarn, and because tomorrow is the anniversary of the Yunnan Uprising and the market will be closed, floating profits were released, causing the market to turn and fall to 1,380 yuan. However, the bulls remained calm and did not move, rising to 1,390 yuan. The closing price was slightly lower, at 1,385 yuan. The total number of transactions for the day was 7,425 bales. The price of 20-count Shuangma yarn fell by 8 yuan. The amounts purchased by various firms are listed below: Firms: 7,200, Hong Kong: 265, Mainland: 10. Total: 7,425

The afternoon yarn market was bullish, with the initial price at 1,388-1,389 yuan. Subsequently, it weakened slightly, with the price at 1,379 yuan. Finally, due to the exchange's partners, the price was 1,382 yuan.

### Cotton Merchants Unwilling to Sell Cheap

Although spot cotton transactions are not developing, holders are very strong-minded. Because yarn and cloth prices rose, cotton prices failed to keep up, so they are unwilling to sell cheap, and asking prices are quite high, resulting in sluggish trading.

In other news, the price of imported cotton. The New York cotton market was quiet. The lack of momentum in stock prices and overseas merchants' sales resulted in a closing price that was three or four pounds lower than the previous day. India fell by two rupees yesterday, including forecasts.

The Shanghai imported cotton market has been quiet in recent days. All parties are not buying in large quantities due to the tightening of foreign exchange. Therefore, cotton prices have not soared. However, firms have consistently adhered to the principle of neither buying nor selling. Current cotton prices are suppressed too much, so the price of cotton will still be high in the future.

### Piece Goods: New Purchases Cease; Cotton Cloth Selling Slightly Weak

The market for factory-made cloth fluctuated yesterday, with ups and downs, eventually loosening slightly. This was because the yarn market rose sharply but then retreated slightly, sentiment was weak, and buyers were quite full. New buyers stopped buying due to high prices, and it is not easy to rise again without new stimulation. Sales of coarse cloth were flat, while fine twill cloth and fine cloth fell by 2.5 to 5 jiao per bolt. The price of bleached and dyed cloth saw little change. Transactions for various cloths on the street were over 400 pieces. Cantonese and Hong Kong firms bought over 100 pieces of bleached and dyed cloth and coarse and fine cloth. Zhejiang and Fujian firms bought over 100 pieces of coarse and fine cloth, bleached cloth, fu silk, etc. The North Road Yantai firms bought over 100 pieces of coarse cloth and colored cloth. Today, 505 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong and 11 pieces were shipped to Xiamen.

Eastern Cloth: Yesterday, due to the rapid rise in recent days, and the fact that the market will be closed for the next two days due to holidays, general retail investors were realizing profits, and selling was strong, leading to a sharp retreat. The lowest price for Longtou fine cloth fell to 31.3-31.4 yuan. Later, hearing that the black market for standard gold was rising, bulls added to their positions and prices rose to 32.1-32.2 yuan. At the closing, there were few transactions of fine twill, and prices fell by 1-2 jiao. Serge was priced at 1.225 yuan, also down by 3 cents.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Soybean Oil Price Surge Unabated

Yesterday, in the miscellaneous grain market, including Shantou soybean cake, under the various abnormal conditions encouraging hoarding, the price surge continued unabated. However, with abundant soybean oil in the underlying market, the trend turned flat. There were significant transactions: 200 dan of factory oil were traded at 96 yuan, and 200 barrels of Dalian oil were traded at 117.5-118 yuan. Another 800 barrels were ordered for delivery in the first half of January at 117.5-118.5 yuan. Peanut oil was in short supply and prices were held high, with prices rising by 1-2 yuan. 200 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were traded at 97 yuan, and 150 pieces of old stock were traded at 94.5 yuan. 30 barrels of Qingdao oil were traded at 128 yuan, and 50 barrels of old stock were traded at 126 yuan. The actual sales of soybeans were strong for both sales and hoarding, and prices continued to rise by 1 yuan, with transactions including over 2,000 bags of Tianjin soybeans, over 400 bags of Fahua peel beans, over 400 bags of Qingdao soybeans, 700 bags of Guidou soybeans, and 200 bags of Tianjin green soybeans.

Yesterday, 400 bags of soybeans, 6,358 pieces of soybean cake, and 600 bags of raw kernels were shipped to Xiamen. Shipped to Hong Kong were 290 bags of soybeans and 9,620 pieces of soybean cake.

### Miscellaneous Matters: Cigarette Factories Suspend Issuance of "Zhan Dan"

In recent days, cigarette market prices have been greatly affected by foreign exchange tightening and surging black market rates. Consequently, factories have stopped issuing "zhan dan" (IOUs) to dealers, causing widespread panic. Both industry insiders and outside speculators are rushing to buy up stock, leading to further price increases. Yesterday, Old Knife brand cigarettes traded at 1,020 yuan, Great Britain brand at 1,380 yuan, Pin Hai brand at 900 yuan, Five Flowers brand at 700 yuan, Fairy brand at 700 yuan, China-made Hua Cheng Company’s Golden Mouse brand at 920 yuan, and Little Beauty brand at 950 yuan. With strong buying interest from all sides, prices are expected to continue to rise.

### Today is National Revival Day: Schools at All Levels Take a Holiday to Commemorate; Educational Organizations in This City Send Telegrams of Respect to Chairman Chiang; Intensifying the Implementation of National Education; Promoting the Conscience Donation Movement

(Dahua News Agency) Today is National Revival Day. All public and private schools in this city are closed for one day. The significance of National Revival Day is explained, as well as the responsibilities that citizens should bear for the revival of the nation, to show commemoration and encourage self-improvement. It has been decided to intensify the implementation of national education and promote the conscience donation movement. Various prominent educational organizations also jointly telegraphed Chairman Chiang today to express their respect, vowing to work diligently in their respective positions under the leadership of the supreme leader. Regarding the opinions issued yesterday by the local authorities in this city on rescuing the livelihoods of teaching staff, unanimous support was also expressed. Schools at all levels have also specially compiled a musical teaching material called "Leader's Song" to guide students in singing in unison, thereby stimulating the enthusiasm for supporting the supreme leader.

Telegrams of Respect in Support of the Leader Various prominent educational organizations in this city, such as the Shanghai Educational Association, the Secondary School Friendship Association, the Secondary School Guidance Research Association, the Supplementary School Teachers' Association, the Art Education Research Association, the Primary Education Research Association, and the Compulsory Education Promotion Association, regard Chairman Chiang as the supreme leader for the revival of the nation and specially telegraphed their respects today (original text omitted).

The Federation of Middle School and University Students and the Vocational Youth Advancement Association in this city also telegraphed their respects to President Chiang today (original text omitted).

Unanimous Support for the Authorities' Proposals The aforementioned educational organizations also expressed unanimous support for the opinions issued yesterday by the local authorities in this city regarding the rescue of the livelihoods of teaching staff. In the future, schools must strive for financial transparency. Aside from rent, 70% of the funds will be allocated to teachers' salaries. The increase in tuition fees will not exceed 20% to 50%, based on past fee standards and actual economic conditions. Reduction and exemption measures will be separately established for poor students. It is hoped that the central government's relief efforts will be implemented as soon as possible to achieve the goal of the "Relief Movement for All." Social assistance is especially hoped to be promoted together.

Singing the Leader's Song in Unison In order to further stimulate students' enthusiasm for loving and supporting the supreme leader Chiang Kai-shek, schools at all levels have specially compiled a musical teaching material called "Leader's Song," which will be sung in unison from today onwards. The lyrics are as follows:

Great is China, generation after generation produces virtuous and capable individuals. Having experienced changes and chaos, they are all able to revive. Chiang Kai-shek, the savior of today, we follow him, forward, forward, revive, revive.

Statement by Pan Hongding, Executive Director of the Orphanage The Communications Agency Was Spoken to and Rectified

Yesterday, we received a letter from Mr. Pan Hongding, Executive Director of the Shanghai Refugee Children's Education and Care Home, stating: "To the esteemed editor, I have read the report in the Education News section of your newspaper on the 23rd of this month regarding the Shanghai Refugee Children's Education and Care Home beginning to reorganize its affairs. There is a news item about a conversation between Hongding and a reporter from the Datong News Agency, and the content is slightly inaccurate. It has been verified that on that day, Mr. Ru, a reporter from the Datong News Agency, visited Hongding at the Xian Shi Life Insurance Company. He casually asked questions in a personal capacity. At that time, he asked that the matters discussed regarding the Home be exempted from publication. Now, upon reading the disclosed news, there are inaccuracies. Therefore, I hereby make the following corrections: (1) The so-called strike by teachers at our Home, as reported in various newspapers recently, is not a fact. (2) Although not all facilities in the Home are perfect, they are definitely not as corrupt as reported. (3) Regarding the handover from the previous director, Li Ruzhang, it was only stated that some receipts were incomplete and there were some deficits, but no specific amounts were mentioned, nor was it stated that there were no books or records available for verification. It is believed that the reporter of the agency misheard. I hereby request that your newspaper publish this letter in the letter section to make corrections. Sincerely, Pan Hongding, Executive Director of the Shanghai Refugee Children's Education and Care Home, December 24, the 19th year of the Republic of China."

The Children's Singing Troupe, Wu Tong's solo, Xue Xinmei's martial arts, etc., were all exceptionally wonderful and received enthusiastic applause from the audience. The fairy tale drama "Anecdotes of Christmas" had a novel theme, a special way of performing, and a profound meaning. The "Shanghai Scenery" of the live report was vivid and lifelike. The final program was "Metropolitan Epidemic" by the society's drama group.

The French Municipal Council inter-departmental ball and chess tournament has been generously supported by Mr. Hu Guoqiao, a director of the French-Chinese Sports Association, who donated two large silver cups to encourage participation. The number of departments that have registered to participate in the competition is extremely enthusiastic. With comparable strength, it is still unpredictable which department will take home the championship in the future.

### Christmas

— Shui Rong

"Damn it, what time is it, still sprawled out!" the old man cursed, kicking Xiao Hu, who was sleeping soundly on the ground, hard with his foot.

Woken up from a deep sleep, Xiao Hu felt a sharp pain in his thigh. He opened one eye halfway and met the old man's fiery gaze and sinister expression. "Last night..." he mumbled a few words through his nose. Immediately, he rubbed his eyes and scrambled to his feet, fastening his pants.

The winter sun shone palely on half of the street. Hei Zi, the skinny kid, stood timidly to the side, silent.

"Today is the foreign bodhisattva's birthday. Pick something good. I'll give you..." the old man said, his fiery eyes suddenly softening. But somehow, it looked even scarier than when he was angry.

Xiao Hu snorted and turned his head to call Hei Zi, "Let's go."

The two ran shoulder to shoulder past the church gate. The gate was tightly closed, as quiet as a grave.

"Hei Zi, didn't you hear anything last night? The foreign devils inside, men and women, were humming and hawing on the grass on our side all night long, until dawn. Damn it, they were even dancing! Holding hands, making a big circle, with some kind of tree in the circle, covered with red and green lights. Those foreign devils were dancing around the tree, singing, laughing... I watched through the cracks in the fence... it kept me up all night, and I even got a few smacks!"

Hei Zi shook his head. This kid was always trembling, even with his "older brother." Unlike Xiao Hu, who seemed like a different person as soon as he left the hateful old man, talking and laughing.

"It's for that foreign bodhisattva's birthday, I guess."

Turning right, the street became lively. All sorts of cars roared and sped by. People jostled, shouted, and argued. At a tram stop, a noble young couple held a chubby girl. "Baby, don't forget to ask your dad to buy you a foreign doll when we get to 'Children's World'." The woman winked at the man, and they smiled at each other!

Xiao Hu ignored them. He pulled Hei Zi into the crowd. "Hey, your grandpa's smiling at you!"

Hei Zi glanced at the white-bearded, red-suited old man in the shop window. Then his eyes fell on the sock-like bag on his back. That was what he never tired of looking at! The bag was filled with soft bread, and things wrapped in colorful foreign paper. Just looking at it made you swallow your saliva. Wasn't it because he hadn't had anything to eat all morning?

Turning left again, the street became narrower, littered with vegetable leaves and fruit peels. Gradually, stalls selling foreign potatoes, carrots, cabbage, and dried vegetables appeared on both sides of the street. A fishy smell drifted in the air with the cold wind. Cops waving wooden sticks were chasing female vegetable vendors without permits.

Xiao Hu whistled leisurely, his hands in his pockets. Hei Zi was dragged along beside him. The further they went, the louder the noise became, almost bursting their eardrums.

"Shhh!" Suddenly, Xiao Hu stopped, made a face at Hei Zi, and darted past the fruit stall at the entrance, running into the vegetable market. Hei Zi lagged behind, but soon ran in as well.

The market was crowded with people. There were also quite a few yellow-haired, blue-eyed foreign women, carrying wicker baskets, weighing foreign potatoes and such. Their feet felt like they were stepping in mud, all wet and sticky. Suddenly, a scale flew down from mid-air, followed by a burst of curses.

"Can't afford it, what are you buying! A 24-tael scale is the death of the poor!"

Hei Zi wandered around, eventually reaching a stall selling Zhoushan turkeys. A fat foreign woman was weighing a large turkey. He saw Xiao Hu standing behind her, winking at him.

The foreign woman was paying. Hei Zi nervously ran over and nudged her with his left elbow.

"What are you pushing for, you little shrimp!" the foreign woman wheezed in broken Chinese.

"Who's pushing? Did I push you?"

Xiao Hu thought, "That kid Hei Zi's voice is shaking too much!" But he was making a ruckus! He grabbed the chicken and ran.

"Catch! Catch!"

"Catch that kid, he's an accomplice!"

Xiao Hu seemed to faintly hear Hei Zi crying. His heart sank. He ran as hard as he could, and after a while, he finally breathed a sigh of relief: "Damn!"

"Hey! Take one and see! 'The poor shall come to me!' So says the Lord. The Lord bless you!"

Only then did Xiao Hu realize that he was not far from his "old nest." The church gate was wide open. A faint organ sound wafted out, accompanied by a somber chant: "Glory!..."

The old man stood by the fence, staring with a pair of terrible eyes. "What took you so long?"

"Hei Zi messed up!" He handed over the chicken.

"Forget him! That little devil is useless, he needs a taste. Here, good kid! Buy two fried pancakes to eat!" He patted Xiao Hu's shoulder, and carried the chicken away.

Xiao Hu took the two torn five-cent notes, watched the old man's back, and shook his fist a few times.

### Willow of Changtai

— Gu Mingdao

(7) Cold Spring Water in the Pond

Under Stone City, a crouching dragon and a crouching tiger, was filled with bloody wind and rain, and murderous war clouds. The Qing troops broke Yangzhou, and Lord Shi died for the country, the Ming army disintegrated, and the Yangtze River was full of banners and flags, all of which were Qing troops. Although there was a natural moat, it was difficult to stop them. It can be said that the royal spirit of Jinling was dimmed. The Hongguang Emperor had abandoned the city and fled to Wuhu, and the large and small officials fled and surrendered. Many refugees, supporting the old and carrying the young, scurried around. The Qinhuai River, which was once full of singing and dancing, was also covered with death. Jade people were no longer seen behind the beaded curtains, only ghosts could be seen. At this time, Qian Muzhai had already seized the opportunity to slip back to Yushan and said to Liu Rushi: "The country is unfortunately overthrown, and I only have one death to repay the country. What about you?" Liu Rushi said calmly: "I have long been prepared to die for the country, and I don't care about anything. Why should the Prime Minister panic?" Qian Muzhai sighed and sat back in his chair, as if he were paralyzed for half a body and couldn't stand up. Liu Rushi said: "The capital has fallen, and the defenders have fled everywhere. This is the most shameful thing. Only Lord Shi Kefa fought against the Hu captives and died in Yangzhou, leaving the righteousness of heaven and earth. We have no choice but to follow in the footsteps of Lord Shi and give up our lives for righteousness." Qian Muzhai nodded and said: "We can only do this. Let me have three days of drinking with Qing, and then follow the late emperor to the pile." Liu Rushi thought to herself that you could not die in Nanjing, but ran back home in a puff of smoke, which already had hindsight. After returning home, you could not say goodbye to your family and serve the country with loyalty. You still have to drink for three days before you die. Why are you acting so slowly? So I was a little dismissive. But because of the deep love between the couple in the past, maybe he was short of heroic spirit for me, and he was hard to let go of the love of his children for a while. The song of Chu Bawang under the siege also has the sentence of What about Yu Xi? Although he is not a double-eyed hero, it is difficult to die for the country resolutely, so he had to forgive him a little. Therefore, during these three days, Muzhai hid in the Hongdou Villa, drinking pure wine with Liu Rushi every night. When drunk, he sang a song. Qian's songs were mostly in the tone of what can I do, while Liu's songs were quite in the spirit of seeing death as going home. During the day, Liu Rushi helped Muzhai prepare for his funeral affairs, taught his children, and lived in seclusion. His mother took his parents to heart, so everyone in the family knew that the Shangshu was going to die for the country. But on the morning of the third day, the magistrate of this county suddenly came to visit Muzhai in person. Liu Rushi initially did not want to extend the meeting, but Muzhai told his servants to allow the meeting. He went to the study to talk with the magistrate for a long time before the magistrate said goodbye and left. Liu Rushi asked Muzhai, what did the magistrate come to discuss? Muzhai said: "He just came to ask me how to deal with it when the Qing soldiers come, so as not to cause local corruption." Liu Rushi said: "What did the Prime Minister say to him?" (20)

### The Great Deed of Christmas

— Jia Yu

Christmas is a joyous holiday, and exchanging gifts is a popular tradition. The Hollywood stars receive an unusually large number of gifts because, in addition to relatives and friends, there are gifts from their fans. Therefore, the number of gifts received by the stars ranges from hundreds to at least dozens. The total value is, of course, a large sum.

Christmas is coming again this year, but many people in East Asia and Western Europe have suffered from the ravages of war. Mr. P.G. Smith of New York, in view of this, first proposed in the newspaper that this year's Christmas gifts should be changed to cash, and the recipients should donate the proceeds to the International Red Cross to help these suffering people. Since Mr. Smith took the lead, many people have responded to this move. Among the stars, Wayne Newton, Coleen Townsend, Carol, and the American-Chinese photographer James Wong Howe have all expressed their support for this great act.

This is indeed a great deed, a great deed worth promoting!

### Shanghai Opera School Stages "Holding the Wheel Battle"

— Yun

"The Great Battle of Yu Qilin Holding the Wheel," also known as "Song Jiang Relinquishes the Throne," is an old play that has been lost for a long time. In the past, the veteran opera actor Wang Fushou (known as Red Eyes Four, with extensive knowledge of the arts) had preserved this secret script. Later, Li Hongchun obtained it, but he never taught it to anyone. Therefore, the Fu Liancheng Society in Beiping, the Opera School, and other troupes have never performed it. Last year, Hongchun was employed by the Shi Xin Stage. The Shanghai Opera School took the opportunity of Li's visit to the school to ask for guidance on everything. In addition to teaching operas at the school from time to time, Li generously presented the secret script of "Holding the Wheel Battle" as a gift. Now, the Opera School has rehearsed it thoroughly and plans to perform it publicly at the day show on Wednesday, the 26th of this month. The singing, acting, and fighting are extremely complex. The Liangshan heroes all appear on stage together, so the play is also known as "All the Stars Gather in Righteousness." The important programs of the play are listed below:

Yi Jianchou Captures Wen Gong Alive. Offering Sacrifices to Chao Gai is Extremely Satisfying. All the Stars Gather in Zhongyi Hall. Taking Dongchang, Junyi Loses an Opportunity. Yu Qilin Holds the Wheel Battle. Zhang Qing, the Wise Shepherd of Liangshanpo. In the past, when others performed "Zengtou City," it usually ended with "Yi Jianchou" capturing Shi Wengong alive. "Holding the Wheel Battle" is the continuation of the story after "Yi Jianchou." Those who have seen "Zengtou City," "Daming Mansion," and "Heroic Righteousness" should not miss "Holding the Wheel Battle" because the beginning and end are connected, and the plot after capturing Shi is all performed in this play.

### Christmas and the Film Industry

— Xin Fang

Two film stars in Hollywood have birthdays on Christmas Day, and you must be familiar with their names: Humphrey Bogart and Louis Mauritius.

The arrangement of programs for Christmas at the Grand Theater in this city seems to have become a routine. Every year, it is always a work starring Shirley Temple. Last year's "The Little Orphan Annie" and the year before last's "The Little Colonel", and this year's "Since You Went Away". But this film is her last before leaving the silver screen; therefore, next year's Christmas program at the Grand Theater will probably change.

Before the war, every year at Christmas, the large and small cinemas in London were open all night. This year, the government has issued a notice that they must close at 12 o'clock, otherwise they will be punished by the police.

Chen Yunshang, the current film star who is red-hot, originally lived in Hong Kong. Do fans still remember the date of her first visit to Shanghai? On Christmas Day of the Republic of China in 1938, at around 4 pm, the Russian Empress brought a proud child from the south, which was her! Zhang Shankun and his wife went to the pier to welcome her, and a banquet was held at her private residence that evening to cleanse her of dust.

Sylvia Sidney, who became famous all over the world with the film "Madame Butterfly", has been silent in the film industry for a long time. She plans to host a party at her private residence this Christmas to entertain colleagues in the film industry, and take this opportunity to express her intention to "make a comeback."

In the United States, many cinemas, on Christmas Day, in addition to providing wonderful movies for ladies and gentlemen to enjoy, viewers can sometimes get the opportunity to enjoy a rich meal, and they do not need to pay a higher price than usual. The situation in Shanghai is the opposite. On Sundays or public holidays, most cinemas raise their seat prices instead.

### After Finishing "Red Bloodbath", Xia Xia Will Go to Guangxi to Get Married

— Lin

After leaving Xinhua, Xia Xia put almost all of her energy into drama. In the meantime, although she starred in a "Qinhuai Family" for Golden Star, she once said that she would choose carefully before making movies in the future, and she would never agree to act in boring movies. Her regular job is to act for the Shanghai Drama Arts Society. She said: Acting in some plays that she considers valuable is a kind of spiritual comfort for her. However, although she is temporarily out of the film industry, she seems to still have a little relationship with Xinhua, that is, part of her drama in "Xi Shi" has not been completed. Currently, Xia Xia is rehearsing "Red Bloodbath", which is a new work by Yu Ling and Wu Chentai, directed by Hong Mo, and is planned to be a big play staged on New Year's Day. According to sources close to Xia Xia, she may leave Shanghai and go to Guangxi after finishing "Red Bloodbath". What is the purpose of this trip? We don't know. However, we know that Xia Xia's fiancé, after returning from Europe, is working in Guangxi. Some people speculate that Xia Xia may be going to get married, but that can only be confirmed by Xia Xia herself.
