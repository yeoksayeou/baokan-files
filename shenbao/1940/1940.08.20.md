### 15,000 Japanese Soldiers from Taiwan Arrive at Hainan Island to Threaten Vietnam. Haikou Becomes the Center of Japanese Military Activities. Battles Continue Around Ding'an and Jiaji.

Hong Kong: According to local Chinese newspapers, more than 15,000 Japanese soldiers have arrived at Hainan Island from Taiwan, preparing to attack Vietnam. The key port of Haikou on the island has now become the center of Japanese military activities. A large number of transport ships are busily unloading soldiers, field artillery, tanks, armored vehicles, and food supplies. In addition to two elite regiments of Japanese troops from North China, there are also Koreans, Taiwanese, and puppet troops. These troops are stationed in Haikou, Qiongshan, and Lingao on the northern coast of Hainan Island, ready to be dispatched to Haiphong at a moment's notice. The tall buildings in Haikou have been occupied by the Japanese army and used as barracks and military supply depots. All troops must train under the scorching sun to acclimate to the tropical climate. Japanese soldiers are frequently seen coming and going on the streets and in the suburbs of Haikou.

It is reported that the naval base in Yulin Port, Sanya, and Yazhou Bay in the south of Hainan Island has been completed in fact. The repair dock in Yulin Port has also been completed, capable of repairing ships up to 10,000 tons. Three Japanese light cruisers are currently undergoing repairs in the dock. It is rumored that Japanese torpedo boats and submarines in Sanya and Yazhou Bay are loading food supplies. The construction of this naval base began ten months ago. A large number of laborers were forced to serve under the strict protection of the Japanese navy, and the construction work was extremely secretive. Strict measures were taken to prevent intruders and spies. In Ding'an and Jiaji in the northern part of Hainan Island, Chinese and Japanese troops are engaged in scattered battles. The Chinese side has mobilized more than 3,000 local Li and Miao people to resist. These indigenous people are extremely resentful of the Japanese army's previous air raids, which killed 300 of their people. The Wuzhi Mountain in the center of Hainan Island is still in the hands of the Chinese army. (International News Agency dispatch on the 19th)

Editorial

### US-Canada Joint Defense

As a result of the meeting between US President Roosevelt and Canadian Prime Minister King in Ogdensburg on the evening of the 17th, a joint statement was issued on the 18th, stating, "The two sides have agreed that Canada and the United States should immediately organize a permanent joint committee on defense, to begin studying naval, land, and air problems immediately, and to consider the defense of the northern part of the Western Hemisphere from a broad perspective; this committee will be organized by four or five representatives from each side, mostly selected from the naval, land, and air forces." Canada is part of the British Empire. Last September, it followed Britain in declaring war on Germany and is now continuing to fight in Europe. The expeditionary force has already departed one after another, and it is making every effort to supply air force personnel and materials. At this time, the establishment of an agreement with the United States of a defensive alliance nature is, of course, a very thought-provoking and noteworthy event. The scope and specific methods of US-Canada joint defense may not yet be secretly determined; in short, they have not been revealed and cannot be speculated upon. What is credible is that the attitude of the US and Canada towards each other will be open and honest, and they will trust each other sincerely. In nature and in spirit, the US will definitely not invade or take advantage of the situation; it will completely respect Canada's sovereignty and original national status; and Canada will definitely not abandon Great Britain, willingly humbling itself and becoming a vassal of the US. Facts are still needed to explain what is to come: On the one hand, Canada is loyal to Great Britain and is doing its best to fight; on the other hand, how will it be loyal to the US-Canada joint defense agreement and do its best to share the heavy responsibility of naval, land, and air defense in the northern part of the Western Hemisphere with the US? There is no doubt that both the US and Canada have a deep understanding of this point, but what the actual dimensions are is probably what the world wants to know as soon as possible!

The US faces the Atlantic Ocean on the left and controls the Pacific Ocean on the right. The Atlantic Ocean side causes the US to deal with complex factors because of the complexity of the European situation, which affects the future of the US in every way. The Pacific Ocean side causes the US to deal with complex factors because of the distance of Hawaii and the Philippines, which extend into the Far East, and the complex relations, which involve the current interests of the US in every way. Dealing with both sides in this way makes the US feel the need to unite the Americas more urgently. Therefore, analyzing the international policy of the US, to the east towards Europe, to the south towards the countries of Central and South America, to the west towards the Far East, and to the north towards Canada, the objectives pursued are completely different because the objects are completely different. Only by comprehensively observing the east, south, west, and north can the entire national policy of the US be seen. The current overall international situation places the US in an environment where it must carefully consider various factors. Compared to other countries in the world, even if each country has its unprecedented difficulties and dangers, it also has its own specialty; for example, China is only fighting against Japan to seek final victory, Japan is only seeking to complete its aggression against China, Britain is urgently dealing with Germany, Germany and Italy are urgently dealing with Britain; the Soviet Union can still wait and see, while the US cannot stand idly by and must do something, but there are thousands of threads. The Soviet Union has at least maintained complete freedom of initiative at present, while the US's initiative still needs to be struggled for in order to ensure complete security. Not only that, but China's being invaded, France's being conquered, and Britain's fighting alone are all warnings to the US, and they are all threats that the US feels. President Roosevelt and other far-sighted people are exhausting their minds and energies to figure out how to carry out their national policy, how to fulfill the various responsibilities and morals that the US cannot get rid of to its own country, to the Americas, to the European situation, and to the Far East. But there have been great achievements one after another. The Pan-American Conference in early July formed a further unity for the countries of Central and South America; now, for Canada, joint defense is determined; all these acts of righteousness have supreme value in politics, economics, and military affairs, and the fundamental significance lies in the penetration of the American spirit throughout the Americas, creating a basis for good harmony and close cooperation.

If the US cannot unite the Americas, it will be a fatal failure for the US; it will lack a sound basis for the US to deal with international affairs outside the Americas; as for the future, the US will inevitably complete its technological construction in the Americas on the one hand, and show the activity of its policies in the international community on the other hand.

### US and Canada Sign Joint Defense Alliance, Organize Permanent Joint Committee to Consider Defense of the Northern Part of the Western Hemisphere

Ogdensburg: When US President Roosevelt and Canadian Prime Minister King held an important meeting in President Roosevelt's special train yesterday, the two sides agreed to establish a permanent joint committee for Canada and the United States to plan the defense of the Western Hemisphere. The committee will also jointly study "issues related to the sea, land, and air, including personnel and raw materials, etc." After the meeting, the two sides issued a statement stating, "The permanent joint defense committee will be organized by four or five representatives from each country, most of whom will be active military personnel, and the meeting will be convened soon." President Roosevelt's meeting with Prime Minister King lasted from 6:15 PM on Saturday to 1:00 AM yesterday. The statement did not mention Canada's participation in the European war as an autonomous dominion, but the agreement reiterated President Roosevelt's assurance to King in Ontario, Canada, that the United States would not stand idly by if Canada was threatened by a North American country. After the US-Canada agreement, the United States and Britain will negotiate the purchase or lease of sea and air bases on British islands in the Western Hemisphere.

Washington: Today, people here have expressed their approval of the establishment of a permanent joint defense mechanism between Canada and believe that it is an effective means to enhance the defense of the Western Hemisphere. Isolationists have unanimously praised this plan, and administrative officials have also fully supported this joint defense mechanism. Senator Holder of the Democratic Party of Sifford and Niger, while expressing approval of this mechanism, also issued a warning, saying that if the British government moves to Canada, it will introduce the war into the United States; if Canada wants the United States to defend its territory, it must allow the British government not to move to the Western Hemisphere. Senator Thomas of the Democratic Party of Utah said that this mechanism is very good and will be beneficial to us. Congressman Bloom of the Democratic Party of New York also said that this mechanism is excellent. Senator Van Nuys of the Democratic Party of Indiana told a reporter from the United Press that he would do his best to cooperate with this mechanism. Senator George of the Democratic Party of Georgia said that this plan is very good because it can allow the United States to obtain bases in the Atlantic Ocean, but he also said that any formal agreement must be like a treaty and should first be approved by Congress. This remark has made some observers wonder whether President Roosevelt has been authorized to establish this mechanism, but legal circles believe that President Roosevelt has been authorized to build this mechanism and does not need the approval of Congress.

Washington: Republican Senator Vandenberg commented on the proposal to establish a permanent joint defense committee between the United States and Canada, saying that the defense of Canada is the ultimate and unavoidable responsibility of the United States.

(Dispatch on the 19th by Reuters)

Ottawa: The administrative circles here believe that the agreement between US President Roosevelt and Canadian Prime Minister King to establish a permanent joint defense mechanism between the US and Canada is very important. According to US official opinion, the progress of this matter will increase Canada's status as a North American country. People in the US believe that this agreement will allow Canada to fully join the maintenance of the Monroe Doctrine. It is also said that this understanding is sufficient to serve as a medium for cooperation between the US and Britain on the defense of the Western Hemisphere. Political circles here believe that Prime Minister King has been authorized to represent the British Empire in participating in the defense of the Western Hemisphere, and some specific proposals are expected to be established. (Dispatch on the 19th by the United Press)

Ottawa: Colonel White Legan Lee, former Assistant Secretary of the Army in the cabinet of US President Wilson, recently responded to the invitation of the Canadian Minister of Information and broadcast to the entire country, saying, "What I hope for from my country is that the United States will draw its sword to fight for freedom and humanity. I pay tribute to Canada, which has no doubts. For the sake of their own interests, and in terms of both wisdom and courage, the countries of the Western Hemisphere should follow in Canada's footsteps and provide Britain with unreserved assistance. If the Americas remain asleep and Britain declines, then the Americas will regret it too late when they wake up. The world cannot survive in a state of half-slave and half-free. Hitler knows this, so he drives his nation, which is good at trampling on others, to destroy the last fortress of freedom." (Dispatch on the 19th by Reuters)

New York: It has been reported by telegraph from the Panama Canal Zone that the United States will build a naval base in the Galapagos Islands for the purpose of defending the Western Hemisphere.

Tokyo: Those overseas Chinese who wish to leave Britain may not be able to do so because German announced on August 17th a counter-blockade against Britain, and Japanese ships can no longer reach various ports in Britain.

### Japan Will Prohibit the Sale of Luxury Goods, 300 Million Yen Worth of Inventory Difficult to Dispose of in the Short Term

Tokyo: The Japanese government has issued a notice prohibiting the domestic sale of various luxury goods from October 7th of this year.

Among them, silk fabrics, such as embroidery, gold thread, and silver thread inlaid fabrics, have a total inventory of 300 million yen. It is impossible to dispose of them in the extremely short period of seven weeks. The only option is to reweave them into other things, remove their gorgeous colors, and relaunch them on the market. Regarding this matter, the Osaka Prefectural Government's Economic Section has temporarily agreed with the store owners to assist them in transforming luxury goods into plain daily-use clothing. In addition, pearls and gems are also prohibited. The Kobe Jewelers Association is now planning to stop manufacturing ornaments and convert the factory to manufacture various instrument parts, which has been tested once and the results are satisfactory.

### Italy Considers Attacking Aden

Rome: Authoritative sources recently stated that once the Japanese army completely occupies British Somaliland, the Italian army will not rest for a moment and will continue to attack Aden in order to completely control the Red Sea and cut off the supply of military supplies and reinforcements to British territories in the Near East. Although the Italians generally acknowledge that Aden is more difficult to attack than Somaliland, most are optimistic because the Italians believe that there are three methods sufficient to force Aden to surrender, and they say that this method can also be used simultaneously. Aden is to Italy as Britain is to Germany, the problem is the same, holding that the former's scope is smaller, because Italy's attack on Aden also requires troops to cross the sea to attack, and although Britain's navy in Aden is not very large, it is stronger than Italy's navy in East Africa. Most of the Italian fleet is currently in the Mediterranean, but according to observers, Italy has a large number of aircraft in East Africa, which Britain cannot match. The Italian army may consider transporting troops by plane to attack Aden, which is also unknown, because Italy used planes to transport troops when advancing into Albania. The second method to make Aden submit is to blockade. The Italian army can use its air superiority to have planes bomb all supply ships sailing to Aden. Aden is surrounded by barren land with no food production, and even drinking water must be transported from outside. Once Italy implements a blockade, this British colony will immediately feel a terrible poverty. Also, this blockade can also be carried out by bombing Aden's reservoirs and water tanks. Water is an extremely precious item in Aden. I have been to the site twice during the Italian-Albanian war, so I know. The third method to capture Aden is a diplomatic method, which may be used in conjunction with other means. Mussolini has worked hard to promote the friendship between Italy and Arab countries, and has an even stronger friendship with the King of Yemen. All the areas in front of Aden are related to Yemen, and the Yemen tribes are often heard to have not very good feelings with Britain. Therefore, Italy may be able to obtain the assistance of Yemen or at least obtain the permission of the King of Yemen for the Italian army to attack Aden from land through its territory.

### General Comfort Association Telegraphed to Report Income and Expenditure Situation

Chongqing. The National General Comfort Association telegraphed the whole country on the 18th to report on the income and expenditure of donations, stating briefly: The association handles national comfort affairs, and all administrative expenses are jointly maintained by participating agencies, without using any donations. In addition to issuing formal receipts for all donations received, they are all compiled and published in the Central Daily News or simultaneously published in several newspapers. The use of donations is decided in advance at meetings of representatives from various agencies, and afterwards, the auditing situation is reviewed by representatives from the Audit Department stationed in the association and reported to the Audit Department and participating agencies for their records. A list of donations collected up to the end of June of this year is being compiled for printing. The spring festival comfort funds received in Chongqing totaled more than 600,000 yuan, and more than 400,000 yuan have been remitted from other places one after another, all of which have been published in newspapers one by one. According to the regulations for the implementation of spring festival comfort activities, the recipients of the gifts are frontline soldiers, honored veterans, new recruits, and families of those resisting aggression. The association: (1) Entrusted the Logistics Department's Political Department with 160,000 yuan to continue running five general teams of wounded soldier reception centers, totaling 120 centers, which are currently distributed in the front lines of various war zones [text missing]; (2) Used more than 200,000 yuan to comfort the national air force and handle air raid relief and funeral subsidies for families of those resisting aggression, as well as to comfort honored veterans and volunteer soldiers; (3) Plans to invest 300,000 yuan in developing production enterprises for families of those resisting aggression and has requested the Agricultural Production Promotion Association and the China Industrial Cooperative Association to plan three to five anti-leprosy factories on their behalf, and is selecting factory sites in [text missing] and other places, which will be promoted to various parts of the country in the future; (4) Will donate 500,000 yuan (if the spring festival donations are insufficient, the association will find other ways to make up for it) to frontline soldiers and has decided to organize four comfort groups to go to various war zones to deliver gifts, stipulating that they be delivered to the (regiment) level, with each group using 500 yuan as the standard for a meat meal for the entire group. It was originally scheduled to depart on (July 7), but because the Nanyang Overseas Chinese Comfort Group was comforting the front lines at that time and comfort groups from various places were also traveling frequently, it was decided to postpone the departure to (August 13). However, due to transportation issues, negotiations for vehicles and gasoline have not yet been resolved. Furthermore, because the meaning of gift-giving is more about spirit than material, secretly distributing the gifts has little impact.

### German Air Force Offensive Against Britain Subdued Yesterday; German Losses in the Air Battle the Day Before Were Extremely Heavy; British Planes Attacked Boulogne, Dropping Three Tons of Bombs

London. After suffering heavy losses of 140 aircraft yesterday, Germany's air blitz has diminished in intensity today. One German bomber appeared over a city in the southeast this afternoon, circled for several weeks, and dropped two bombs, both of which landed in open fields. Prior to this, a German bomber was shot down in southwestern England. The Air Ministry claims that a German bomber was shot down in southern London yesterday by soldiers of the Home Guard using Lee-Enfield rifles. A joint communique issued by the Air Ministry and the Ministry of Home Security stated that recent reports have confirmed that the general damage from enemy air raids on Britain yesterday was not significant. However, several high-explosive bombs fell on a city in southeastern England, destroying several houses and causing minor casualties. Last night's air raid was small in scale. Several bombs fell on some parts of England and southern Wales, causing minimal damage and injuring only a few people. (19th, Reuters dispatch)

London. According to official sources, at least 600 German planes came to attack yesterday, attempting to break through the London defense line but failing. Their losses were at least 115 aircraft, accounting for more than one-sixth of the attacking force. A joint communique issued by the Air Ministry and the Ministry of Home Security stated that, according to incomplete reports, British fighter planes shot down at least 73 enemy aircraft, anti-aircraft guns shot down 12, and searchlight teams shot down one. British fighter planes also lost 16 aircraft, but the pilots of eight of them were safe. (19th, Reuters dispatch)

Berlin. Yesterday, the German Air Force launched coordinated attacks from all directions with the aim of breaking through the British defense line. German bomber squadrons were led by fighter escorts to reduce bomber losses. The German Air Force has concentrated in the Netherlands, Belgium, and France, preparing to launch group attacks on Britain as soon as orders are received. (19th, Huitong dispatch)

London. Air force observers here pointed out that although Germany has declared a complete blockade of Britain, the points where German forces concentrate their air raids are all aimed at eliminating Britain's resistance, so as to facilitate German landing attempts. Observers here believe that last week's air blitz was a prelude to the cooperation of other German forces. The targets of German attacks are all aircraft factories and munitions factories, which are sufficient to weaken Britain's long-term resistance. (19th, Associated Press dispatch)

Berlin. Yesterday's air battle centered on Portsmouth Harbor. The British Air Force attempted to prevent the German bomber squadrons from attacking, but was unsuccessful. Many German Messerschmitt aircraft broke through the British aircraft's defense line and shot down many British aircraft. After the German bomber broke through the gaps in the British defense line, it launched large-scale bombing attacks on British airfields in various places. (19th, Huitong dispatch)

Berlin. The German Air Force continued to attack Britain yesterday, bombing military targets, seaports, factories, and airfields in Kent and Hampshire. Many British aircraft were destroyed in an airfield near London. Air battles occurred between German and British aircraft during the attack. According to current reports, a total of 54 British aircraft were shot down and 21 German aircraft were lost. German aircraft also shot down several barrage balloons. (19th, Huitong dispatch)

Weather Affects German Aircraft Activity

Berlin. Due to unfavorable weather conditions, only a few German aircraft squadrons went to attack the southeastern coast of Britain yesterday morning. One squadron of eight aircraft first flew to Brighton and then flew north to Kingston. Another squadron of ten aircraft flew from Artois in France to the Thames River. Due to the worsening weather and strong westerly winds, the German aircraft squadrons first flew in dense, low-altitude formations and then ascended to between 5,000 and 8,000 meters, reducing their speed. (19th, Huitong dispatch)

Berlin. A report just received from the German Air Force base in France stated that due to the heavy fog and bad weather on the ground, only a few aircraft flew to Britain yesterday for reconnaissance flights. Despite various difficulties, all German aircraft safely returned to their bases, fully loaded with valuable intelligence and photographs of military targets. (19th, Huitong dispatch)

British Air Force Attacks German Military Areas

London. An Air Ministry communique stated that British Air Force coastal fighters attacked the port of Boulogne last night, bombing seaplanes and ships with great success. British aircraft also attacked oil refineries, munitions factories, aircraft storage depots, and railways in German territory, as well as 26 airfields in northwestern France and Belgian territory. All British aircraft returned safely. (19th, Reuters dispatch)

London. The British Air Ministry Intelligence Department stated that last evening, British aircraft attacked the port of Boulogne, dropping three tons of high explosives and many incendiary bombs. British aircraft struck every two minutes, and the bombs fell like rain. The entire harbor was bombed, and the main docks were hit several times. However, most of the bombs fell between ships and seaplanes. One seaplane was blown to smithereens. British aircraft dived and opened fire from machine guns to destroy anti-aircraft guns. The British fighter escorts for the bombers claimed that there was almost no place in the Boulogne area that was not on fire upon their return. (19th, Reuters dispatch)

Air Battle Situation Near London

London. The Air Ministry Intelligence Department stated that two bombs hit a commercial center in a London suburb, and when some people ran into air raid shelters, they were strafed by enemy aircraft. Several areas were also bombed in the evening. A warden in a certain town stated that when enemy aircraft flew to the town, they were only 80 feet high. Three or four German aircraft several miles away appeared to be out of control. When passing through the streets of a certain village, they flew so low that they touched the chimney of a village house, dropping a bomb that landed on the roof, causing several shops in the neighborhood to be destroyed. An elderly woman, aged ninety, who refused to take refuge in an air raid shelter, was killed in the bombing. Several bombs fell in the cemetery of a church in another town, shattering tombstones. Enemy aircraft were severely hit by British fighter planes and crashed in the countryside. Some German aircrew members died in the fires, and the rest were quickly captured. At noon yesterday, the southern outskirts of London, Kent, and other areas in southeastern and southern England were also bombed. There were minor civilian casualties near Croydon. Casualties from bombing elsewhere were light, and material damage was also minimal. In the evening, large numbers of German aircraft crossed the southeastern coast near Dover, attempting to break through the London defense line along the banks of the Thames estuary. However, they were repelled by British fighter planes over Kent and Essex. According to incomplete information received, material damage from last night's air raids was slight, and there were few casualties. Several British Air Force airfields were bombed, causing some deaths and injuries. According to unofficial reports, 42 enemy aircraft rushed towards the London area last night but did not reach their targets, as they were stopped by anti-aircraft guns and intercepted by British fighter planes. They turned and fled back to sea. At night, the skies over a certain town in Essex were densely packed with about 100 German bombers. British fighter planes met them head-on, and the crowds ignored the calls of the air raid wardens and gathered at the doors to watch the battle, cheering wildly every time a German aircraft crashed. Furthermore, 40 German dive bombers escorted by fighter planes heavily attacked airfields in the southeastern region, and were fiercely attacked by British aircraft emerging from the clouds. It is generally believed that about 15 people were killed or injured around the airfield, including two young women. Airfields and ports in southern and southeastern England were attacked again. London residents heard the roar of anti-aircraft guns for the first time. Coastal batteries from Essex to Hampshire also shelled. Two alarms were issued in London in the evening, and the loud explosion of 17 bombs dropped on the suburbs could be clearly heard. A squadron of Spitfire British aircraft engaged a formation of German bombers attacking airfields over Surrey and destroyed six German bombers and five fighters in an instant. A squadron of Hurricane British fighters patrolling over Kent saw five Messerschmitt German bombers at an altitude of 11,000 meters and climbed to shoot down all five aircraft. There were two break-ins over Hampshire, the first at 1 p.m., when nine British fighters shot down nine enemy aircraft. An hour later, 11 British fighters intercepted another batch of enemy aircraft and shot down all 11 of them. A reporter who witnessed the enemy aircraft attacking the London area reported that the enemy aircraft first came in at an altitude of 25,000 to 30,000 feet, and their presence was only known from the occasional reflection of sunlight on the tips and the sound of their engines. Nearby residents quickly entered air raid shelters, and British fighter planes had already begun to engage. Soon, judging from the sound of the aircraft, it was known that the enemy aircraft had turned back from not far from its destination. About a quarter of an hour later, bombers were seen arriving and diving rapidly to bomb. The houses shook as bombs exploded and anti-aircraft guns fired fiercely. When the enemy aircraft returned, those who looked up saw enemy aircraft falling and being pursued separately by British fighters. Another reporter in the southeastern area stated that the enemy aircraft came in three groups, each with 12 aircraft, flying in a V formation. It was seen that one group rapidly descended towards a certain target to drop bombs, while the remaining two groups flew in other directions. British Spitfire fighters then followed closely in pursuit. (19th, Reuters dispatch)

Berlin. The Croydon and Sutton areas south of London were bombed by German aircraft yesterday. German aircraft were divided into several batches, dropping many bombs on Kenley and Biggin Hill and destroying British aircraft at the airfields, eight in one place and thirteen in another.

In the air battles, the squadron commanded by Commander Huss achieved particularly remarkable results, shooting down a total of 51 aircraft. 34 German aircraft have not returned. (19th, Huitong dispatch)

Berlin. This afternoon, the German military communique stated that yesterday German aircraft attacked military targets in southern and central England, and the airfields around London and in Kent and Hampshire were particularly fiercely bombed. A merchant ship (4,000 tons) was sunk in the English Channel, and another was severely damaged. German aircraft and enemy aircraft engaged in fierce battles with enemy aircraft in various places. 51 enemy aircraft were destroyed by the Air Force brigade led by Lieutenant Colonel Huss. It is rare for one air force squadron to achieve such a great battle record. Last night, German fighters bombed the large gasoline pond in eastern London, the arsenals in Norwich and Essex, the port facilities in Milford Haven, Bournemouth, and Weymouth, and several airfields in southern England and near Liverpool. The sky was lit up by flames, and explosions were heard far and wide. Several ships in the aforementioned ports were damaged by bombs. Last night, British aircraft dropped bombs in western and western Germany, causing minimal losses. In total, 147 enemy aircraft were lost yesterday, of which 124 were shot down in air battles, 23 were destroyed by anti-aircraft guns or on the ground, and 33 barrage balloons were destroyed. 36 German aircraft are missing.

### Britain Prepares to Attack When the Time is Right; Morrison Delivers Speech

London. British Minister of Supply Morrison said yesterday: "Britain is preparing to launch a large-scale offensive when the time is right. Three months ago, the situation was serious, but the situation has changed, and I am very gratified. Although today's situation is not yet satisfactory, we have already placed in the hands of the army the weapons that are sufficient to defeat the enemy. Even if the enemy attacks tonight, our army will be able to deal with it effectively. After the navy's protection, supplemented by the great resources of the British Empire, the United States, and other neutral countries, and our firm determination not to fail, we will be able to reach a position in a few weeks that is worthy of appropriately trusting to cope with everything. Once the current crisis has passed, our armed strength will be even stronger." After listing the numbers of war equipment that the Ministry of Supply has procured, Morrison said that in recent months, the war equipment industry has greatly increased because it has purchased refined steel from the United States. Germany's statement that Britain lacks steelmaking raw materials is false, because Britain has an abundant supply of British Empire and foreign iron ore, so there is no need to worry about a lack of sources. Morrison went on to talk about post-war construction, saying that many of Britain's weaknesses before the war were the result of a lack of appropriate economic and management planning. We are willing to eliminate inequality and eliminate insecurity and fear, and we want all aspects to have more complete, freer, and more creative national life opportunities. (19th, Reuters dispatch)

### British Air Force's Unprecedented Victory; British Newspapers Enthusiastically Praise

London. Today's Times enthusiastically praised the unprecedented victory of the British Air Force last week, saying that the only credible point in the various propaganda from the German General Command and the German Propaganda Ministry about the air raids on Britain is that they often call this air raid a large-scale offensive. This is evidenced by the number of aircraft used last week, especially the German aircraft that attacked our country's coast on Thursday, estimated at about 1,000. The only possible conclusion is that we have already secured a steady victory in the first round of the Battle of Britain. The newspaper's diplomatic reporter claimed that the various false propaganda released by Germany over the weekend was clearly intended to lure Japan and Spain, judging from the German radio station's selection of all comments from Japanese and Spanish newspapers over the weekend, which can show that Germany is eager to understand the effect of its propaganda. Germany believes that the false propaganda during the Norway campaign (such as saying that Germany had sunk half of the British Navy) was very helpful in swaying Italy to join the war. Now it hopes that fabricating the result of Britain's "lack of resistance" can similarly lure Japan and Spain. The Germans have filled the pages of newspapers in Japan and Spain with their propaganda, probably believing that they can cover up the truth. (19th, Reuters dispatch)

### German Aircraft Use Smoke to Write Words in the British Sky

London. The British Air Ministry stated that German Air Force personnel carried out light bombing raids in southeastern England yesterday, causing minimal damage. One German aircraft suddenly fell from the formation and used smoke to draw a G in the air. Observers stated that this move may have been to celebrate General Goering's birthday, but others said that the G represents Germany, meaning that Germany will eventually defeat Britain, since Goering's birthday is on January 12.

A large contingent of British troops began embarking on ships on Saturday for Aden to avoid the advance of Italian forces. Gayda also attacked the civil and military officials of French Somaliland, condemning them for assisting the British after France and Italy signed a peace treaty. Some interpret this as an indication that Italy will simultaneously occupy French Somaliland. Gayda stated, "Last night, Italian troops clashed with the enemy's last line of defense, located in the mountains about 65 kilometers from Burao. The British imperial forces are using these fortifications to protect the retreat of their main forces, allowing them to escape to Aden on British ships from Burao." (United Press dispatch, 19th)

### British Fleet Bombards Italian Fortifications in Libya, Causing Damage to the Capuzzo Fortress

Somewhere in the Mediterranean: A Reuters correspondent with the British Mediterranean Fleet reports on the bombardment of Bardia and Capuzzo fortresses by the British fleet on Saturday. After receiving intelligence from the British army along the Libyan border, the British fleet set sail on Friday afternoon, proceeding without lights through the night. At dawn on Saturday, they formed a line several miles off the Libyan coast. Shortly after, bugles sounded, ordering fire to commence at 7:00 AM. Minutes before the start of firing, the correspondent climbed a ladder and crouched near the smokestack. The commander and staff stood on the bridge, while artillerymen, wearing steel helmets, waited by their guns, everyone with cotton stuffed in their ears. At 7:00 AM, the cannons opened fire, from six-inch to fifteen-inch guns firing together. The air vibrated, and smoke filled the sky. We could barely stand due to the shock, and when the sixteen-inch cannons fired, the warship shuddered violently from the recoil, and my knees buckled. Tons of shells and explosives flew toward the enemy positions. Navy reconnaissance planes circled above, reporting that the fifteen-inch guns were hitting their targets accurately. One shell scored a direct hit on the Capuzzo fortress, eight miles inland, causing extensive damage. Another shell landed in the camp. The small Italian fort of Lanra was almost completely destroyed after a few minutes of intense bombardment. The cannons then concentrated on destroying locations where enemy forces were concentrated. All four British ships hit their targets. The barracks in Bardia were also damaged. After half an hour of continuous bombardment, the firing ceased. British fighter planes accompanying the British fleet destroyed five enemy aircraft while the British ships were bombarding Bardia and Capuzzo fortresses. Two more enemy aircraft were probably lost. British aircraft first engaged an Italian seaplane attacking the British fleet, causing it to catch fire and crash. Shortly after, a squadron of seventy-nine type enemy aircraft attacked, but were scattered by British aircraft. Two Italian aircraft crashed. Soon after, another large squadron of seventy-nine type enemy aircraft flew towards the British fleet to attack. In the ensuing engagement, two more Italian aircraft caught fire and crashed. Another Italian aircraft was pursued and shot down by a British plane. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)

### German Foreign Ministry Elaborates on the Meaning of the Total Blockade of England, Blockade Plan Does Not Target Neutral Countries, Absolute Adherence to General Principles of International Law

Berlin: Dr. Ritter, a German Foreign Ministry ambassador, declared to foreign journalists yesterday that the German note on the total blockade of England was delivered to the governments of various neutral countries the day before yesterday. The note took effect upon delivery to each country. Regarding the issue of American ships going to England to evacuate children, the German government has not yet received a formal proposal and cannot express an opinion. The American government should contact the German government regarding this matter. The spokesperson stated that the total blockade of England is not an unrestricted submarine warfare. The British blockade plan targets not only Germany but also the non-occupied areas of France, and neutral countries such as Spain and Portugal are also affected by the naval certification system. The German blockade of England targets only England, and the means of blockade are not limited to submarines. Aircraft and speedboats also play an important role. The German blockade plan does not target neutral countries and strictly adheres to the general principles of international law. (Haitong dispatch, 19th)

Vichy: Regarding Germany's declaration of a total blockade of England, French authorities here yesterday expressed their approval, stating that France is also a victim of England's starvation tactics, which England uses to oppress France. Therefore, anything that can invalidate the English blockade is welcomed by France. The blockade taken by Germany will certainly take effect. A minister in the Pétain government expressed deep regret that France could not participate in the new measures to blockade England. All French newspapers printed the German declaration on the front page but did not criticize it. Le Moniteur headed its article "Germany Undertakes a Total Blockade of England" and selected the following passage, saying, "The blockade of England is for the benefit of Europe, because England has expanded its blockade to all European countries."

### France Implements Planned Economy

Vichy: Following the passage of the Provisional Law on the National Organization of Industrial Production by the State Council, it was recently published in the government gazette. In addition to establishing "Organization Committees" for each industry separately and dissolving national labor and management organizations such as the French General Confederation of Labor and the Employers' Federation, the law stipulates detailed plans for industrial production and the purchase of raw materials. The government may requisition various goods when necessary. Furthermore, national agriculture has also been placed under government control. In short, after the implementation of this law, the entire French economic system will be completely placed on the foundation of a planned economy. (Havas dispatch, 18th)

Vichy: The French Minister of Production and Labor, Pétain, recently told reporters, "At this point, the free trade system has gradually disappeared. Countries around the world, regardless of their political system, are inclined towards a controlled economy. This phenomenon has existed for a long time and is not a new fact. This is because a country's economy must be subject to some control, which has always been the case. What is different from the past is that the question in the past depended on who implemented the control and for whose benefit. At this point, we are trying to implement a controlled economy for the common good, which refers to the interests of the nation and the people." (Havas dispatch, 18th)

Among them were members of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, deputies of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, directors of various People's Commissariats, representatives of the Red Army and Navy, Heroes of the Soviet Union, and members of the diplomatic corps. When Stalin and his comrades appeared, the entire crowd cheered in unison, expressing their fervent support. After the program began, amateur aviators first gave a flight demonstration. They were members of the Moscow Aviation Association, practicing flight in their spare time without interfering with their original work. After the amateur aviators' demonstration, civilian aircraft took off. The viewers were full of wonder as the amateur aviators demonstrated extremely complex techniques. The glider demonstrations were particularly interesting to the viewers. They dove straight down from high altitude and then straight up from low altitude, forming circles as if they were wheels rotating at extremely high speed. The mastery of technique was unparalleled. Among the participants in the demonstration were famous glider personnel such as Matushev.

Four Hundred Aircraft Participate in the Demonstration

The demonstration by military aviation personnel gave the audience an unprecedentedly profound impression. The demonstration was commanded by Major Yeremenko. First, Uglevantov piloted a high-speed fighter to demonstrate the skill of Soviet aviation personnel and their readiness to meet enemy aircraft. This was followed by a demonstration of simulated air combat by fighters and bombers. At the same time, fighters covered bombers "bombing" Moscow factories. At this moment, the entire crowd cheered in unison, as five famous Red Wing aircraft appeared in the Moscow sky led by Hero of the Soviet Union Lakayev. The five aircraft crossed the airfield at high speed, demonstrating extremely complex techniques. The people of Moscow, witnessing this magnificent demonstration, not only cheered and paid tribute to the pilots but also expressed their gratitude to the workers who manufactured the aircraft. A total of 400 aircraft participated in the demonstration, showcasing the strength of the Soviet Air Force and the skill of Soviet aviators.

### Central District of the International Settlement to be Temporarily Defended by the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, US Authorities Have Accepted This Proposal, Meanwhile, US and Japan Conduct Negotiations

The Shanghai Municipal Council's information office issued the following announcement last night: "It has been decided that the US Navy will delay the implementation of the compromise plan passed by the majority of the Defense Force Committee. US authorities have agreed that, pending the outcome of negotiations between the US and Japanese governments on this matter, the 'B' Sector of the British defense area will be temporarily defended by the Shanghai Volunteer Corps. The Shanghai Municipal Council has agreed that the Shanghai Volunteer Corps will temporarily defend the 'B' Sector currently defended by British troops."

Considering Measures to Adapt to the Situation

Since the decision of the commanders of the defense forces of various countries on the 15th of this month that the central district of the settlement after the withdrawal of British troops would be defended by US troops, all parties have expressed their pleasure. However, the Japanese side alone has dissented and has tried to overturn this decision, requesting that the Defense Force Conference be reopened for discussion. A Japanese naval spokesman made a report on this matter at a reception for Western newspaper reporters last night, saying that the authorities of the defense forces of various countries are still considering "appropriate measures to adapt to the current situation, aiming to find a suitable answer in the shortest possible time."

Japanese Troops Enter the Western Shanghai Defense Area

The spokesman continued that he was deeply concerned that further discussion of this issue at the press reception would hinder the smooth progress of the negotiations, so he would not make any further comments on this matter. It is generally believed that the British troops currently stationed in Shanghai will withdraw within this week. According to the latest news, the responsibility for patrolling the central district and maintaining order and security will be entrusted to the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department. When necessary, the Municipal Council is free to request assistance from both the Japanese and US military authorities. As for the western Shanghai district, it is not included. It has been agreed that the district will be defended by Japanese troops, and a majority of Japanese troops have already entered the district.

Also States That a Second Meeting Will Be Held Soon

According to the English-language China Press, a Japanese Embassy spokesman told the newspaper reporter yesterday (the 19th) morning that the Defense Force Committee of various countries may hold a second meeting soon, at which time the Japanese representative will propose another plan for the plan voted on by the Defense Force Commander's Meeting on Thursday (the 15th). The spokesman did not specify the date of the second meeting or whether the defense force commanders of various countries had made a decision, nor did he disclose how the Japanese side would propose. However, according to another source, the Japanese authorities may request that the area currently defended by British troops be placed under the full jurisdiction of the Municipal Council Police Department after the British troops withdraw.

It was purchased and shipped to China by Mr. Hickle, the former manager of the Shanghai American Wireless Company. It is said that the company may still have an interest in the occupied materials. According to the North-China Daily News, the Japanese-owned China Communications Company received wireless equipment from Chongqing yesterday at a certain location on Route Tenant Road, valued at approximately 1.5 million yuan.

### China Press Reporter Cheng Zhenzhang Shot, Hit by Two Bullets, Recovery Progressing Well, Rickshaw Puller Injured by Stray Bullet

At 10:45 AM yesterday, an assassination occurred at the intersection of Avenue See Ang Road and Route Pére Robert in the French Concession. The victim was China Press reporter Cheng Zhenzhang, who was shot twice. At the same time, a rickshaw puller was also injured by the thugs. The thugs then escaped in a car. The following is a report of the details:

(Attacked by Thugs Not Far From Home)

Cheng Zhenzhang is from Hangzhou, 30 years old, and resides at 17 Shun'an Lane, Avenue See Ang Road. He works at China Press as an international editor. At 10:45 AM yesterday morning, Cheng walked out of his residence intending to wait for the No. 21 bus at the intersection of Route Pére Robert to go to work. A white-牌 car was parked in front of No. 10, Lane 7, Avenue See Ang Road. Four thugs were lying in wait inside the car, and had been waiting there. Although there were many pedestrians on the street at the time, no one paid attention to it. When Cheng walked to the front of the Zhengda Rice Store at No. 9, two of the thugs suddenly got out of the car, both wearing black short shirts and trousers made of Xiangyunsha silk. One person grabbed Cheng's chest, and the other pulled out a pistol and shot Cheng. A total of three shots were fired. Cheng was hit by two bullets, one entering through his mouth and exiting through his left cheek, and the other entering through his abdomen and exiting through his lower back. He fell to the ground bleeding.

(Rickshaw Puller Also Hit by a Bullet)

Seeing that they had achieved their goal, the thugs were about to get back into the car and escape when a rickshaw puller from Jiangbei named Shen Pin You (27 years old, living at 222 Kangti Road, Ma Lang Road) suddenly heard the gunshots. Not knowing what was happening, he abandoned his rickshaw and fled. The thugs suspected he would report them to the police and aimed and fired a shot. The bullet hit the rickshaw puller in the buttocks, causing him to fall to the ground injured. At that time, the thugs got back into the car and fled north on Route Pére Robert. An Annamese policeman patrolling Route Pére Robert heard the news and drew his gun and chased after them, firing a shot at the car. The thugs also returned fire from the car, but no one was injured. However, the thugs managed to escape. Because the atmosphere was tense during the exchange of fire, the policeman was unable to record the license plate number of the car used by the thugs.

(Surgery Went Well)

As for Cheng, after being shot, he was rushed to the Guangci Hospital by ambulance. The French police also dispatched a large number of detectives to the scene of the incident to investigate. After Cheng arrived at Guangci Hospital, he immediately underwent surgery. The progress of the operation was quite good, but the liver was pierced by a bullet, and there was also minor damage to the intestines. As of yesterday afternoon, his temperature was only 37.1 degrees, and he was very alert. According to the doctor, he will be out of danger within three days if there are no changes. It is said that Cheng is not yet married and has only an elderly mother. His father is in Jinhua. Before the war, Cheng worked as an editor for the Chen Bao and Xin Bao. He is honest and amiable. After he was suddenly attacked yesterday morning, people from all walks of life sent their condolences to the newspaper.

### British Troops Leaving Shanghai Soon, Band Performs Yesterday, Unprecedented Scene at Racecourse, British and American Nationals Offer Sincere Farewell Wishes

After the British War Office announced the withdrawal of British troops stationed in Shanghai on the 9th of this month, preparations for the withdrawal were immediately carried out. Now, with the departure date approaching, and a part of the British troops already departing Shanghai on Saturday of this week aboard Jardine Matheson's De Sheng Wheel for Hong Kong, after thirteen years of friendly relations with the people of Shanghai, their sudden departure has left many feeling reluctant. In addition to broadcasting a farewell message to all the people of Shanghai on the evening of the 16th of this month, representatives of the British forces, the bands of the West Yorkshire Regiment and the East Surrey Regiment, held a grand farewell performance at the Racecourse at 6:30 PM yesterday. All British nationals, British officials, and Chinese and foreign people in the city attended, and the enthusiasm of the occasion was rarely seen in recent years. The details are recorded as follows:

(Enthusiastic Guests)

At 6:00 PM yesterday, all British nationals and Chinese and foreign people in the city gathered at the Racecourse. The crowd was so large that people entered in single file through the side door of the Racecourse. The cars they arrived in stretched all the way to Avenue Edward VII Road and Chengdu Road, causing traffic congestion. Both stands inside the Racecourse were packed with people, with hardly any space left, numbering no less than 6,000. There were still more than 300 guests who were unable to enter and were blocked in the grassy area in the center of the Racecourse. In order to maintain order, in addition to dispatching detectives to direct traffic at each entrance, more than 30 Chinese and Western detectives were deployed throughout the venue to provide tight security.

(On the Reviewing Stand)

More than ten British military flags of various types fluttered in the wind on the stands. A corner of the northern stand was specially set aside as a reviewing stand for British officials. Mr. Cornell, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Major General Smyth of the U.S. Army, and other British and American leaders, more than ten in all, arrived early. At 6:30 PM, two cars drove in from outside. Under the gaze of all eyes, British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, British Commander Major General Simmons, British Consul-General George, and the leading consul, four in all, stepped out of the cars and, to the enthusiastic applause of all British nationals, were led by Sir Archibald Clark Kerr to the reviewing stand, where they shook hands with British and American leaders one by one before taking their seats in the front row of the reviewing stand to await the review.

(Performance and March)

At 6:45 PM, the bands of the East Surrey and West Yorkshire Regiments marched out in formation to thunderous applause from the guests. The East Surrey band, comprising 28 people, led by Mr. Henry, played and sang Scottish folk songs, walking back and forth in front of the stands for about 15 minutes. Following them, the West Yorkshire band, with about the same number of people, led by Mr. Operting, began playing another famous song, also marching in the same way in front of the stands. After the two bands performed separately, they joined forces and set off again, playing and singing an extremely beautiful and moving song. After the song, they lined up at the stands and paid their respects to the British officials. British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr stood up and returned the salute. Thus, amid the "Farewell Song" played loudly by the two bands and the cheers and applause, the 40-minute performance came to an end. British nationals flocked to the bands, offering the members extremely sincere farewell wishes. In the fading twilight, they shook hands and bid each other farewell.

### Japanese Plane Crashes and Burns at D场

At the Japanese military airfield in the D场 town north of Shanghai, at around 5:00 AM yesterday (the 18th), three Japanese light bombers took off. As they were circling and ascending, one of them suddenly crashed to the ground and caught fire at a low altitude of several hundred feet above the ground. For a time, thick smoke billowed into the sky, and the sound of the explosion shook the ground, greatly alarming nearby residents. Because the area is a Japanese military zone, heavily guarded, the cause of the crash and the extent of the damage were temporarily unknown.

### New Japanese Organization, Japanese Taxpayers' Association

According to the North-China Daily News, after the Japanese failed in the Shanghai Municipal Council elections, the newly formed Japanese Taxpayers' Association will hold a meeting soon to elect 20 standing committee members to discuss the interests of Japanese taxpayers. The association has gathered 100 members to participate in the meeting and elect standing committee members from among them. The chairman of the association is currently concurrently the chairman of the Japanese Residents' Association, and the association's address is also located within the association.

### Strict Security Measures to Ensure Concession Security

The ordinary security measures adopted by the Shanghai Municipal Police are being continued to ensure the security within the concession in light of the frequent robbery cases in recent days. The barbed wire frameworks set up at various key intersections have not yet been completely removed. Chinese and Western detectives stationed on both sides are selectively checking suspicious pedestrians. These ordinary security measures will now be extended to maintain security and order within the district.

### Hurricane Changes Direction, Threatens Coastal Fujian and Guangdong

According to a report from the Zikawei Observatory yesterday morning, the direction of the Pacific hurricane has changed from northwest to west-northwest, so the threat to Shanghai has gradually decreased. According to the observatory's report at 6:00 AM yesterday morning, the hurricane had reached 19 degrees north latitude and 122 degrees east longitude. The center of the storm was within a radius of 60 nautical miles, heading west-northwest. According to the reported position, the hurricane has reached the north side of Luzon. If it continues in a west-northwest direction, it will clearly threaten the coast of Fujian and Guangdong. Another Pacific hurricane, after appearing to stall, has ceased to be reported on, suggesting that it may have dissipated.

### Zhang Hanyuan Shot in Front of the Continental Swimming Pool, Bullet Pierces Back, Life in Danger

Zhang Hanyuan, a 28-year-old native of Zhejiang residing on Avenue Joffre, was walking east on Jing'an Temple Road in front of the Continental Swimming Pool last night at 9:30 PM, wearing a light gray suit, when two men suddenly followed behind Zhang and fired a shot at Zhang's back. The bullet entered his back and exited through his left chest. He fainted and fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. The shooter, seeing that his goal had been achieved, escaped into the crowd and disappeared. Chinese policeman No. 1014 nearby heard the sound and rushed to the scene, immediately summoning an ambulance to take him to Baolong Hospital for treatment, where he was placed in room 307. His injuries are severe, and his life is in danger.

### Dreadful Indian Summer, Citizens Need to Take Precautions

In recent days, the new autumn heat has been unusually severe, and the weather is abnormal, making all kinds of seasonal ailments easily spread. The Indian summer is again baring its fangs and claws, wreaking havoc on the human world. According to statistics from the Shanghai Municipal Council Health Department: the number of deaths in the previous week totaled 884, breaking the highest death record of the year, with dysentery, typhoid fever, and measles being the most prevalent. According to local news, cholera is gradually becoming epidemic, with a mortality rate of about 15%. This shows that the situation is quite serious. Citizens, fearing the plague, are buying various effective preventive medicines to prepare for the worst. Among them, the most popular is Lee Chung Seng Tong's Bao Ji Pills. Because this Bao Ji Pills is a well-known old-brand medicine in China and abroad, it has the most effective ability to treat and prevent diseases. It is effective for vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pain, epidemics, cholera, various dysenteries, and other Yangwei diseases. Moreover, the medicine is pure and mild, and it is easy to take. Therefore, people from all walks of life are happy to purchase and prepare Bao Ji Pills, and they all believe that it is the most effective way to prevent the Indian summer.

### Resumption of Foreign Ships on Shanghai-Fujian Line, No Hope in the Near Future, Moufu Wheel Resailing to Gu'aotou Has Been Abandoned, Lighter Tonnage Vessels Are Still Planned to Try Sailing Again

After the Japanese army announced the blockade of the coastal ports of Zhejiang and Fujian, Songmen and Gu'aotou in Zhejiang Province, and Sanjiangkou in Fujian, were not included in the blockade, so customs clearance was carried out as usual. However, ships sailing to the above three places were all subjected to inspection and ordered to return. As a result, the ships Shenyou, Shenhua, Xin'anna, and Yongfeng, which had previously sailed to Sanjiangkou, did not reach their destinations and were forced to return. The Shenhua Wheel also encountered a robbery, resulting in huge losses. The ships Hana, Moufu, and Yongtai, which sailed to Gu'aotou, were also obstructed and have returned to Shanghai. It is also rumored that the Moufu Wheel planned to try sailing again, but it is reported that the company has abandoned the plan and is unloading the goods onto the wharf.

Changde Returns to Shanghai

The Changde Wheel sailed from Shanghai to Gu'aotou with cargo on the 7th of this month. It was repeatedly searched by Japanese warships along the way and accidentally entered the Japanese naval cordon line and was detained for a time. After the shipowner tried his best to explain to the Japanese navy, he was released. After many twists and turns, he left Aojiang on the morning of the 10th. It took a whole week to unload the cargo. Because Japanese planes bombed continuously for days, the wharves along the river were slightly damaged, and most of the workers fled. There was nothing to do during the day, and a little work was done in the evening, so it was very fortunate that the cargo could be unloaded. Loading the return cargo was even more difficult and had to be returned to Shanghai empty. He arrived in port yesterday afternoon and stopped briefly at Pier 3, The Bund, Wuma Road, before sailing to the opposite bank of Dongjiadu on the Huangpu River to moor. The British-owned Yonghua Wheel sailed to Gu'aotou a few days ago and was able to enter the port. However, because the workers had fled completely, it was impossible to unload the cargo, so it had to return to Shanghai. It has arrived in port yesterday and is now unloading the goods onto the wharf. After the goods are unloaded, it will sail to the waterfront of Nanshi to moor. It is feared that there is no hope of resuming sailing in the near future.

Trying to Sail to Songmen

Although the German Roulin Foreign Company's Gaodeng Wheel plans to resume sailing to Songmen, Nantian, Jinqing Port, and 溪, it is difficult to determine whether it can be implemented. Yesterday evening, two small vessels flying the flags of the constitutional government, both with a tonnage of less than 50 tons, sailed to Songmen. These two small vessels do not have radio equipment, so it will be impossible to know the situation on the sea. A report will only be available after they reach their destination.

Shenhua Passengers

The Shanghai Fujian Fellow Villagers Association, which organized the Shenhua Wheel Robbery Relief Committee, sent representatives to the Yilong Company yesterday morning to negotiate compensation for the losses. However, no concrete results have been obtained. It is reported that the company has agreed in principle to allocate funds to relieve the victims. The details of the negotiations will be announced in detail after the Relief Committee holds its second meeting at 9:00 AM this morning. According to news from the Luodun Company, a Fujianese merchant in Shanghai, the Fujianese passengers whose drafts were robbed received a telegram from Fujian yesterday morning stating that the drafts had not been cashed, which was a great comfort to the losers.

Japanese Shipwrecked

The Japanese ship Chen Li Maru of the Huadong Shipping Bureau, which sails on the Shanghai-Dinghai line to Putuoshan and other ports, was loading passengers and cargo in Shanghai and sailing to Dinghai when it was suddenly hit by a hurricane outside Wusongkou. The hurricane was extremely violent, and the ship could not be steered and drifted with the wind before running aground on a reef outside Wusongkou. Although the entire crew of the ship tried to rescue it, it was to no avail. The hull of the ship was severely damaged, and seawater poured in. More than 100 passengers on board were terrified when they saw that the ship had been shipwrecked and cried for help before jumping onto a nearby shallow beach sailboat to escape. However, they were all badly frightened and suffered many losses of luggage. More than 1,000 pieces of cloth, cigarettes, paper, groceries, and other items were washed away, resulting in huge losses. The ship has now drifted to the beach opposite the Nanhui levee west of Tongsha. The hull of the ship is damaged in many places and cannot be driven to Shanghai for the time being.

### Issuance Dates for Two National Defense and Construction Bonds, Second Instalment

### Sharp Decline in Dance Hall Visitors, Reduced Donation Revenue, Decrease of About 30,000 Dancers

Since the beginning of autumn, the weather has been abnormally hot, even more so than in the intense heat, and there has been a drought without rain, resulting in the spread of infectious diseases. Amusement venues have also seen a sharp decline in business due to this reason. In order to raise funds for the refugee factory, the Dance Hall Group of the Refugee Relief Association Negotiating Committee reached an agreement with each dance hall at the beginning of its establishment. Those with dance tickets of five yuan or more were classified as Grade A dance halls, and each dancer entering or leaving was charged a refugee donation of 10 cents. Those with dance tickets of less than five yuan were charged a refugee donation of 5 cents per dancer entering or leaving. This has been in effect for 17 months. Now, due to the hot weather, the business of each dance hall has greatly decreased. In the past ten months or so, the monthly donation revenue of the dance halls has been around 11,000 yuan, with Grade A dance halls accounting for more than 8,000 yuan (i.e., more than 80,000 dancers per month) and Grade B dance halls accounting for more than 3,000 yuan (i.e., more than 60,000 dancers). However, in July, due to rising prices, poor market conditions, and hot weather, the revenue was only 9,617.55 yuan, with Grade A dance halls accounting for more than 6,000 yuan (more than 60,000 dancers) and Grade B dance halls accounting for more than 2,000 yuan (40 to 50,000 dancers). June was 10,057.40 yuan, which is about 1,000 yuan less than the average of previous months, and the number of visitors has also decreased proportionally by about 30,000 people.

### Eastern Zhejiang Mail Has Not Arrived

The Shanghai Postal Administration has received a notice from Zhejiang Libuhuo that more than 1,000 bags of mail from eastern Zhejiang will arrive in Shanghai. However, they have not arrived as of today. It has been found that no batch of mail between Shanghai and Zhejiang has been received since the interruption on the 16th of last month. Therefore, people from Zhejiang in Shanghai feel very depressed and hope that the post office will find a way to open the postal route and increase the speed of delivery.

### Chen Yanlin Kidnapping Case Planned - Three Captured Bandits All Suffered Gunshot Wounds - Sent to Hospital for Treatment, Interrogation After Recovery

Chen Yanlin, owner of Yecheng Industrial Company located at No. 9, Jinfuli, 389 Hankou Road, was suddenly attacked by four kidnappers at 11:00 AM on the 18th. One person stood guard outside the door, while three entered the manager's office. Upon seeing Chen, two of them took out Mauser pistols to intimidate him, then handcuffed Chen's hands and forcibly dragged him out. Chen, at the time, did his utmost to struggle and

shouted for help.

Seeing things were not going well, the three kidnappers immediately used the butt of a Mauser pistol to strike Chen's head violently, causing him to bleed, in an attempt to stop him from shouting. However, Chen continued to shout. As the bandits dragged Chen out the door, they fired two shots, one bullet hitting Chen's right shoulder. At that moment, a Western constable, No. 280 of the Central Police Station, and a Chinese constable were patrolling nearby and, hearing the commotion, rushed to the scene. Seeing the situation, they opened fire, resulting in all three kidnappers being shot in their hands and legs. Consequently, they abandoned their hostage and

scattered and fled.

One of the bandits, named Wang Chengqiong (also known as Rui Tong, 20 years old, from Jiangbei), fled into the back door of the Huadong Shoe Store at No. 13, Shanxi Road, where he was apprehended by the Western constable. His leg had already sustained a gunshot wound. A Mauser pistol and 18 bullets were confiscated. Another bandit, Zhang Guilin (28 years old, from Jiangbei), sustained a gunshot wound to each leg and continued to flee, injured, to Fuzhou Road. There, a Ruifeng Transportation Company coal truck, No. 23632, was passing by. Zhang fired two shots to

stop the vehicle.

Unexpectedly, Constable No. 1582 was on board escorting the truck. Zhang immediately pointed the Mauser pistol at the constable to intimidate him, then snatched the constable's official pistol and jumped off the truck, fleeing rapidly. He entered through the front door of a certain hotel and exited through the back door, turning into the alley of the Wugong Hotel and running out, entering No. 140, Fujian Road. At this time, a Chinese constable from the Third Patrol Division, No. 172, was passing by. Seeing that Zhang had fresh blood on both legs, he knew he was no good and

drew his gun to stop

his movements. Zhang, exhausted and unable to resist, immediately threw the Mauser pistol he was holding, along with 28 bullets, on the ground. The constable apprehended him and also confiscated the pistol snatched from Constable No. 1582. Another bandit, Xu Baocheng (34 years old, also known as Lao Chen, from Jiangbei), sustained a gunshot wound to his arm. After escaping to the Hongmiao intersection on Nanjing Road, he hired a rickshaw. When the rickshaw reached the Zhifu Road intersection, it was spotted by Chinese Constable No. 3289, who, seeing Chen

covered in blood,

stopped him and asked what had happened. Xu replied that he had just been in a fight and was injured. The constable, considering the injury case to be a criminal matter, took him to the police station, where it was discovered that he was also one of the kidnappers. After investigation by Chinese detectives Li Pengfei and Xu Fusheng, the three criminals and Chen Yanlin were sent to the hospital for treatment. Yesterday morning, the police station's lawyer, Ru Bao-yi, petitioned the First Special Court to approve the temporary detention of the three criminals. Judge Xiao then ordered the detention, pending further interrogation after the criminals recovered from their injuries.

### Robert Road Shooting - Wang Xingjin Shot Dead by Friend

Wang Xingjin, residing at No. 9, Fugui Lane, Robert Road, was visited by Cao Zhenpeng, an acquaintance, around 9:00 AM yesterday. Cao pretended to invite Wang to discuss a matter. Wang, suspecting nothing, followed him to the front of the Jin Yi Glass Factory nearby. Unexpectedly, Cao pulled out a pistol and fired two shots at him, one hitting his left shoulder and the other hitting his ribs. The wounds were very serious, and Wang collapsed to the ground. Seeing that his objective had been achieved, the killer immediately fled without a trace. People summoned an ambulance, which rushed him to Luren Hospital, but the treatment was ineffective, and he soon died.

### Fire at US Military Barracks - Huge Losses - Worth Over US$5,000

According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury", a fire broke out in the material storage room of the US Marine Corps Fourth Regiment barracks near Gordon Road, Xinzha Road, at 2:35 PM last Saturday. The value of the materials destroyed was estimated at US$5,000 to US$7,000, equivalent to approximately 125,000 legal tender. The destroyed materials included a large amount of paint, wood cutting machines, and timber. Fire brigades from Xinzha and Jing'an Temple responded to the alarm and dispatched vehicles to extinguish the fire, which was brought under control around 4:00 PM. A wooden shed used by the motor transport team within the barracks was also completely destroyed, and two trees were scorched.

### Kidnapping of Overseas Chinese's Son - Defendant Found Not Guilty - Bail Granted During Appeal Period

Yang Litai, a 15-year-old Fujianese and son of an overseas Chinese resident at No. 804, Pu Shi Road, was kidnapped on June 8th at noon on his way home from Gubal Primary School on Gubal Road. The vehicle was passing the intersection of Gubal Road and Pu Shi Road when he was suddenly abducted by kidnappers. Yang's mother reported the incident to the police station based on information received. Investigations revealed that a relative of the Yang family, Shi Guozhen, was involved, and he was arrested. He confessed. Based on his confession, Dong Xiaowuzi, Zheng Rusong, Lin Shuangquan, and Chen Wangshi, wife of the driver Chen Er who drove the car during the kidnapping, were also apprehended. During interrogation at the police station, Dong, fearing punishment, violently struck his head against the wall and died from his injuries. The hostage was rescued by the French police on July 6th in a thatched house on Daxi Road, and four kidnappers were captured. As it was not within the jurisdiction of that police station, they were taken away by the "Shanghai Municipal Police Department". The police station handed the four defendants over to the First Criminal Division of the Second Special Court. As Chen Wangshi was deemed uninvolved, she was not prosecuted. The others were prosecuted on charges of kidnapping for ransom. Yesterday morning, Judge Liao concluded the trial and ruled: "Judgement" Shi Guozhen, Zheng Rusong, and Lin Shuangquan are all found not guilty. During the appeal period, the three defendants were each granted bail of one thousand yuan. Without bail, they will remain in custody.

### Chengxing Lane - Water Bill Dispute

A water bill dispute has erupted in Chengxing Lane, May-er-bai-ge Road. Water has been cut off to several households at Nos. 27, 29, and 33. The remaining households have been granted an extension until the 22nd of this month. With the deadline fast approaching, tenant representatives petitioned the Public Works Department, the Fire Department, the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the International Settlement, the Citizens' Federation, and the Xinzha Police Station, one after another, yesterday afternoon. They argued that if the water supply were cut off, the diet and hygiene of the thousands of residents in the entire lane would face a severe crisis. Furthermore, it is now the height of summer, and if a fire were to break out due to negligence, it would inevitably spread rapidly. If this were to happen late at night, the consequences would be unbearable. They were compelled to submit a petition, earnestly requesting that the authorities grant protection and instruct the landlords to consider the hardship faced by ordinary people and the safety of social order, and not to demolish the premises without legal resolution, in order to avoid further disputes. This would be greatly appreciated.

### Two Carjacking Cases Occurred Yesterday Morning - Xiang Sheng Car Later Intercepted on Yuyuan Road

Two carjacking cases occurred within the Public Settlement yesterday morning between 8:40 AM and 9:05 AM. Details are as follows:

(Yi Tai)

At 8:40 AM yesterday morning, two passengers dressed in Western suits suddenly came to the Yi Tai Automobile Company at No. 188, Hubei Road, to hire a car. The accounting office dispatched driver Li A-lin (36 years old, from Haimen, driver number 9000) to drive car number 17711. After the passengers got into the car, they asked to be driven to the Baoshan Road intersection in Zhabei. When the car arrived there, two more people got on, one dressed in a long gown and the other in a coppersmith's outfit. They then ordered the car to be driven to Baotong Road in the northern part of the city. Upon arriving at a dilapidated house, the four people in the car each produced weapons and forced the driver to get out of the car, declaring "Help me out here." One person took the driver, Li A-lin, into the dilapidated house and detained him until around 11:30 AM, before releasing him and telling him that he could find the car himself in the Hongqiao area of western Shanghai. The car was discovered at the Wujiaochang in western Shanghai at 2:20 PM in the afternoon, and the company dispatched Constable No. 2027 to retrieve it. The purpose of carjacking is still under investigation.

(Xiang Sheng)

Around 9:05 AM yesterday morning, two customers suddenly arrived at the Xiang Sheng Automobile branch station on Jiaozhou Road, Yuyuan Road, in western Shanghai. Driver Qian A-liang drove car number 18562 to the intersection of Jessfield Road and Dihua Road. Four more people got on, one of whom was holding a pistol. They instructed the driver to go to the French area's Fahua Town on Columbia Road, ordering the car to stop. Two people jumped out and forcibly dragged the driver, Qian A-liang, out of the car, took off the driver's uniform and had one of the bandits put it on, then drove the car away. They dragged Qian A-liang into a thatched hut and held him captive for about half an hour before releasing him. He then reported the carjacking to the Jing'an Temple Road Police Station. The police station issued an emergency order, notifying all street constables to pay close attention to the vehicle. Before long, the car was intercepted by a constable on duty on Yuyuan Road, and the people and the car were taken to the police station for strict interrogation. According to the bandit, who identified himself as Pan Changsheng, the car was hijacked to kidnap Zhong Caiqing, the manager of the De'erke Lamp Factory at No. 40, Lane 876, Gordon Road. The police are currently searching for the remaining fugitives.

Research on the Duration of Affection Between Spouses

This is a very serious question. There are many couples who married out of love, and were so affectionate during their honeymoon period. But how long does it last? They fall out with each other. Either the man seeks a mistress outside the home, or the woman secretly engages in clandestine affairs, or even sues for divorce. As the saying goes: "Newlyweds are fragrant for three years, after three years they are a stinky latrine." This vividly describes the human tendency to be fond of the new and tired of the old.

Looking at it from another perspective, clothes are better the newer they are, but people are better the older they are. There are many young couples living together and elderly couples who grow old together in the world. Don't elderly couples who have been married for decades often celebrate silver or gold wedding anniversaries? This brings family harmony, a house full of children and grandchildren, and friends gathered together, raising their glasses in joyful celebration. How pleasant and happy! Multiple blessings, long life, and many sons are what Chinese society has always praised. So why doesn't the love between spouses last forever, but is only fleeting?

Let's be frank. A couple is the union of two sexes, and their love is entirely built on the foundation of "unity of soul and body." If couples pay attention to sexual hygiene after marriage and maintain the permanent health of their sexual function, then if they married out of love, their love will surely last forever, without end. If it is a marriage arranged by matchmakers, their love will grow stronger, and their passionate affection will be even greater in the future after marriage. In short, if a healthy and beautiful couple can maintain their sexual health and use their wisdom to create romance, their love will not waver unless there are special environmental temptations. If a man has engaged in masturbation or nocturnal emissions in his youth, or has suffered from excessive indulgence, overwork, or new injuries after marriage, resulting in spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, neurasthenia, infertility, incomplete development, or dissipation of energy, then no matter how compatible their wills are or how comfortable their lives and environment are, love that is only spiritual cannot last long. Their love will inevitably fade day by day, leading to sleeping in the same bed with different dreams, and various tragedies in the family! A smart husband who wants to restore love and rekindle the good times should cure his illness at its root. According to world-renowned doctors and my experience, taking the gonadotropic hormone preparation "Sheng Zhi Su" is the most effective and targeted treatment. This preparation can generate sperm and invigorate the kidneys, strengthen the brain and activate blood circulation, and nourish nerves within one day and night after taking it. Continued use will completely cure the above symptoms in a short period, and can also achieve the effects of prolonging life and rejuvenating youth. However, those with spermatorrhea must also take "Ximituo's Solid Essence Tablets" to strengthen the essence gate and stop the leakage, which will yield faster results. However, if patients can come to this clinic for diagnosis by expert doctors, and then undergo various targeted therapies such as ionization therapy, injections, and surgery, a cure can be guaranteed.

Beauty and Health

### Breasts are the Source of a Woman's Happiness

— Yao Chongpei, MD, USA

I'd rather be mandarin ducks than immortals. Spend the golden years in sweet love. If illness causes the breasts to shrink, science can remedy it without delay!

In today's trend, to be a modern woman and be called "beautiful", one must pay attention to the health of the body, and especially to the development of the breasts! Because when men look at women today, they don't look at their head or feet. Their lightning-like eyes are only directed at your chest. If they see your breasts rising and falling high when you move, showing a proud posture, then even if your face is less attractive, they won't mind at all. Conversely, if your breasts are like deflated balls, loose and shriveled, then even if your face looks like Lin Daiyu or Zhao Feiyan, you won't be able to win their favor, and they may even make sarcastic remarks! As for women who consider themselves smart, they don't hesitate to pass off fish eyes as pearls by wearing bras. But when the curtain of the boudoir comedy rises, their efforts are still in vain, and their true form is revealed. As a result, they are ashamed, and the men are disgusted! Feelings break down, and tragedy occurs!

So why do women's breasts shrivel? According to the experience of world-renowned gynecologist Kandeaning and others, this is due to masturbation, tight clothing, menstrual irregularities, leucorrhea, and postpartum weakness, which damage the function of the ovaries. The only way to remedy this is to actively take the ovarian preparation for women, "Sheng Zhi Su", which is the most effective and targeted treatment. This preparation is well-formulated, and can nourish ovarian function, boost metabolism, adjust menstruation, and warm the uterus and stop leucorrhea within one day and night after taking it. Continued use will not only make shriveled breasts become high and erect, but also make a haggard face become plump and rosy, exuding a fresh radiance from the muscles, charming and moving.

### The Relationship Between Nocturnal Emission and Brain Weakness and Insomnia

— Zhan Nianceng, Specialist in Venereal Diseases

In this bustling city, in the long days and short nights of summer, insomnia is the most painful thing. Because working all day is already very tiring, and the blood is full of fatigue toxins, yet one tosses and turns at night and cannot sleep soundly, listening to the clock ticking away, and then has to return to labor again at dawn. How miserable is this! One's health will inevitably decline day by day, and eventually become incurable!

Although there are many causes of insomnia, young people who are just beginning to experience spring feelings often develop bad habits of masturbation due to ignorance and curiosity. After masturbating for a long time, the nerves are destroyed, and their effectiveness is often weakened or even lost. Therefore, the essence gate cannot be controlled, and nocturnal emission follows. Once nocturnal emission starts, and is not treated for a long time, the brain, spinal cord, and sexual nerves are severely damaged. Therefore, symptoms such as brain weakness, forgetfulness, insomnia, excessive dreaming, aversion to worries, decline of ambition, lower back pain, kidney deficiency, dissipation of energy, and incomplete development follow. Such men are dazed all day long, as if they are sleeping but not sleeping, as if they are drunk but not drunk. Not only do they achieve nothing in their careers and studies, but they also cannot have a happy married life, and are hated by their wives! They may even become prematurely senile and die young, wasting their lives! The only way to remedy this, according to the experience of world-renowned doctors and my own, is to take "Ximituo's Solid Essence Tablets" to strengthen the essence gate and calm the nerves. This not only provides a good night's sleep, but also cures nocturnal emission. If nocturnal emission has already caused the above symptoms, one must also take the gonadotropic hormone preparation "Sheng Zhi Su" to nourish the brain and kidneys, increase essence and blood, and nourish the nerves. Continued use will completely cure the above symptoms in a short period, and can also achieve the effects of prolonging life and rejuvenating youth.

### Ironclad Facts

— Recorded by Zhan Nianceng, Specialist in Venereal Diseases

(1) Young Men with Nocturnal Emission Should Not Delay and Mislead Themselves

Mr. Qiao Rongzu, 30 years old, from Ningbo, came to Shanghai last year to stay in a middle school in this city because his hometown was often bombed. However, the environment in Shanghai was too licentious, and the school lacked good training facilities. Boarding students could often go out for leisure. Once, he was pulled away by a prostitute, and because of lustful thoughts, he committed masturbation. He didn't know that once masturbation is committed, it is easy to become an addiction, leading to relaxation of the essence gate and the outbreak of nocturnal emission. At first, it was only two or three times a month, but then it gradually increased to five or six times, or even ten times. As a result, his face became sallow and thin, his memory deteriorated, he suffered from dizziness and headaches, tinnitus, blurred vision, fatigue in his limbs, and lower back pain. His schoolwork also plummeted. At this point, Mr. Qiao realized the harm of masturbation and nocturnal emission, but repeatedly taking over-the-counter medicines on the market had little effect. He came to this clinic for diagnosis and treatment at the beginning of last month, determined to cure his disease. After the expert doctor carefully examined his symptoms, he knew that it was indeed caused by the mistreatment of nocturnal emission, so he instructed him to go to the Zhongxi Pharmacy to purchase two boxes of the special medicine for nocturnal emission "Ximituo's Solid Essence Tablets" and two dozens of the gonadotropic hormone preparation "Sheng Zhi Su" to take together, and also intermittently use "Diemen's" electrotherapy. After three weeks of careful treatment, he is now full of energy, his mind is clear, and the above symptoms have completely disappeared.

(2) The Husband's Sorrow After Marriage

Mr. Gao Ming, 26 years old, married last winter. The couple has never been able to get along harmoniously because Mr. Gao discovered impotence after marriage, and also had slight nocturnal emission. The couple's relationship is extremely bad. Mr. Gao's inner pain can hardly be described in words. Although he had taken so-called "kidney-tonifying and essence-producing endocrine agents" on the market, they had little effect, and he felt even more depressed! Last month, introduced by his friend (Mr. Gu, who had also been cured of his hidden illness in this clinic), he came to this clinic for diagnosis and treatment. After examining his condition, he instructed him to purchase three dozens of the gonadotropic hormone preparation "Sheng Zhi Su" and one box of "Ximituo's Solid Essence Tablets" to take together, and also administer new medical techniques such as electrotherapy and injections every day. One month has passed, and now he is full of energy and strength, and the couple's love is infinitely entwined.

### Financial News: Foreign Exchange Constrained by Rumors, Chinese Merchants Compete to Purchase Foreign Exchange, Prices Tighten Again

Yesterday's foreign exchange market: HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged.

The pound in New York continued to decline slightly by two points in the morning, but was unaffected. When Chinese merchants and Hong Kong telegram operators saw that American banks intended to sell, they also came to compete for US dollars, so the US dollar was strongest, and could be settled at 5.6875 yuan. HSBC and Citibank suddenly absorbed strongly, and British firm Sassoon continued to buy. The Asian Petroleum Company had a long-term British gold settlement, so it leveled off at noon, and British gold softened to 3 pence 703125.

Asia Petroleum also bought US exchange for October at an opening price of 5.5625 yuan. Until before closing, HSBC still had the intention to buy, and the market trend was unstable. As a result, British gold was 3 pence 703125, and US exchange was 5.625 yuan, which was tighter by 0.015625 than the morning opening for British, and unchanged for US.

### Bullish Interest in Cash Gold Declines, Cash Rebounds Sharply, Bills of Exchange Gradually Tighten is the Main Reason

Yesterday, the cash gold market, in the unofficial market, was tired but firm, due to the unchanged bullish confidence of buyers, bold absorption of additional amounts, and the tightening trend of foreign exchange. Prices were easily pulled up. The lowest in the early morning was only 5,620 yuan. After banks and gold shops took the opportunity to purchase aggressively, it rose to 5,690 yuan. Money changers mostly supplied. Later, securities firms and a certain gold shop sold, slightly reducing it by 30 to 40 yuan. However, upon hearing that the exchange market was soft, retail investors all entered, and it rose again to 5,680 yuan. The noon close was 5,676 yuan. The buying momentum in the aftermarket was even stronger, as favorable rumors arrived again, reporting that the Japanese army had landed in Haiphong, stimulating a rise. Gold shops and others forcefully pushed it up from the opening of 5,680 yuan to 705 yuan. Although it fell slightly later, the highest actually reached 5,750 yuan, due to large purchases by securities firms. The evening close was also 5,730 yuan, a huge rise of 70 yuan compared to last Saturday's close. The transaction volume for the whole day was still strong, about one thousand taels. Jewelry gold in silver shops ultimately increased by 10 yuan, while customs gold remained flat.

Cash Gold Rises Sharply by 70 Yuan

Since the morning, each bar (ten taels), initially had many sellers due to tired sentiment, resulting in a small press of 40 yuan at the opening. Money changers issued 30 taels of silver, for 5,620 yuan. Subsequently, a certain silver shop absorbed madly again and again, and at this time, the gold shop also had a healthy appetite. Although money changers were issuing in the middle, they were ultimately outnumbered. Before long, it rose to 5,690 yuan. Then the gold shop and scattered retailers vomited again, and in addition, securities firms also sold, and it once fell to 5,655 yuan. After this, money changers suddenly came to cover short positions, and the sentiment remained firm. Those who had sold out came to drag in again, so it rose again to 5,680 yuan before closing, and the closing was 5,676 yuan. The market atmosphere was even better in the afternoon. The opening was high by 4 yuan, and silver shops mutually did the upper two, for 5,680 yuan. Subsequently, silver shops and other firms competed to enter, and soon exceeded the 5,700 yuan mark. Silver shops entered 10 taels for gold shops, rising to 5,705 yuan. Later, the securities firm and bullish silver shops vomited out, returning low to 5,693 yuan. Unexpectedly, at this time, there was talk of a reopened meeting of the city's defense forces, and the buying wind rose again. Gold shops and silver shops first came to drag in, rising immediately to 5,720 yuan. After this, there was even more news that Haiphong was tight, and the buying wind became stronger. Around 3:00 PM, a high price of 5,750 yuan was seen. Afterwards, due to excessive floating profits coming out of the market, it fell back by 20 yuan. Gold shops issued 20 taels for silver shops, retreating to 5,739 yuan. As a result, it rose sharply by 70 yuan compared to the end of last week (after the close, the off-site had initially done 5,720 yuan, but the last 5,730 yuan was still difficult to get used to), with a fluctuation of 130 yuan for the whole day. The selling price of cash gold shop's own brand gold was ten yuan higher than cash gold, and the purchase was thirty yuan lower. The current auction gold was fifty yuan lower than the listed gold, with few transactions.

Jewelry Gold Hung High by Ten Yuan

The selling price of jewelry gold per tael in silver shops was initially still 580 yuan in major firms. By 3:00 PM in the afternoon, it was hung high by ten yuan, so major firms changed to suspend 590 yuan. The new firms had similar prices, and the purchase price was reduced by about 20 yuan.

Both the morning and afternoon markets hung at one point four cents, it is said.

### Foreign Currency Rises Again

Yesterday's foreign currency market: Cash gold suddenly rose after falling, and the rising momentum was especially strong in the afternoon, so British and American gold pounds rose as soon as they fell, and ultimately rose by two yuan. The demand for British gold bills was not bad, and the market price rebounded by two corners. Although the US dollar bill had retreated to 17 yuan, 5 corners and 1 point, it immediately stepped up.

### Securities: Domestic Debt Firm and Stable, Foreign Stocks Briefly Tired

Yesterday's securities unofficial market fluctuated slightly, but the trend was still very firm and charming. The competition between the long and short sides was very fierce, but the long side still had the advantage. For example, Lianhe, Tongkang, and Lianyi were sold very enthusiastically, but the long side did not feel pressured. In fact, the circulating chips in the market have been collected and closed by various factions, and the chips in the market are increasingly lacking. Judging from the difficulty of borrowing goods among peers, it is not easy for the short side to raise its head. Yesterday morning, Lianhe sold bravely, followed by Lianyi and Lemao. The market atmosphere seemed to be weak, but as Tongxing's appetite for intake was extremely strong, and Chongsou purchased the Bing and Ding Reds very powerfully, this was another group of collectors closing in. The surface situation suddenly turned firm. In the afternoon, Lianhe suddenly covered short positions, and Chongsou added to the long positions. No. 7 and No. 38 specialized in collecting Category B, and the market situation suddenly improved again. Tongkang and Lianyi were still unable to supply enough, and the market price rose again, so as a result, it still rose by five points one corner to two corners and a half. The total number of transactions was about 900,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:

Category	Highest	Lowest	Closing	Compared to the Previous Day

Unified A	60.45	60.30	60.45	Up 0.05

Unified B	53.70	53.30	53.60	Up 0.25

Unified C	50.70	50.45	50.65	Up 0.15

Unified D	49.85	49.75	49.80	Flat

Unified E	50.25	50.15	50.25	Up 0.05

Stock trading: 50 shares of Huacheng Tobacco Company were traded, at a price of 41.5 yuan

Yesterday, the stock market of various industries was exceptionally firm and stable, and the stock prices of Zhizhi Enterprise, Wheelock Marden, and others all rose. In the afternoon, due to rumors that the工部局 would hold a temporary emergency meeting, selling was triggered in Beijing. The multiple maintaining party was also powerful, so as a result, the prices of various stocks only fell slightly from their highest points.

### Cotton Yarn: Customer Sales Still Fragmented as Before, Long Positions in Cotton Changjiang Still Active

The yarn market initially tired and then rose, but the trend is still in a fickle and constant state. However, current yarn sales, although the transportation routes between Yunnan and Hong Kong have been interrupted, the sporadic purchases of this group continue unabated, so a portion of the people's hearts still tend towards the bullish side. Another saying is that Shenxin No. 9 Factory used to urge customers to ship goods, and now multiple parties have already transferred 4,000 bales to other warehouses, and the warehouse receipts are still not being released, so the large accounts have slightly increased, and the market attitude has been resurrected.

The opening of current yarn in the morning: the atmosphere in the market was sluggish, and most were still on the short side, so the opening price of 20-count Double Horse fell below the 900 yuan mark, to 895 yuan, falling slightly to 891 yuan. Subsequently, upon hearing that the scattered demand in Yunnan and Hong Kong continued, the buying side became active again, and the market price gradually rose. Finally, the multiple parties made some efforts, and the buying momentum suddenly became strong. 40-count Double Horse rose to 955 yuan, and rose another 8 to 9 yuan after closing. Today, 140 pieces of yarn are being transported to Yantai. The amount purchased by various groups is listed as follows:

Peers 1,970	Jiangxi	20

Hong Kong	610	Inland	40

Yunnan	440	Statistics 3,085

Xiamen	5

### Cotton Market Mediocrity, Actual Transactions Quiet

Current cotton trading is exceptionally quiet, with all parties adopting a wait-and-see attitude. Furthermore, there is no great hope for excitement in the yarn market, due to the increasing stock of yarn. In addition, there is good news regarding this year's domestic new cotton crop, so people's hearts are calm, and the market is lackluster.

Another report on foreign cotton market prices: the New York cotton market is quiet, due to the settlement of hedges by Southern traders and the closing of positions by some bulls. As a result, closing prices fell by three to four points compared to the previous day. The Indian market is stable, with yesterday's conditions and forecasts showing little fluctuation.

Shanghai foreign cotton trading: yesterday, due to the stability of yarn prices, people's sentiment improved. Although cotton trading was quiet, industry players' minds were surprisingly firm, mainly because current inventory levels in the market are not abundant. Japanese merchants still purchased a few hundred bales of Indian cotton for forward delivery on silver terms.

### Food: Imported Rice Sluggish

Imported rice, which had been trending downwards since the week before, still felt weak yesterday after the holiday reopening. Although early market brokers tried hard to support prices, the general practical sales from inland traders and local shops remained cautious, making the market mediocre. Later, speculators and smallholders were also listless in their transactions. For example, mid-grade goods were experiencing strong supply but sluggish sales, and even though they were holding steady, they gradually saw a decline of three to five cents from downstream. Only at the midday market did those in need take advantage of the lower prices and become active, settling the market situation. By the afternoon, selling pressure intensified, and because standard rice was already scheduled to open today, the local market became even more sluggish, and the market could not support itself and declined. As a result, it fell by another five, six, or seven cents compared to last Saturday. Reimported original packages were also heavily offered, but both practical buyers and speculators lacked interest in buying, so sales did not open. The total transaction volume of imported rice for the entire day was only a little over three thousand bags.

Glutinous rice arrivals are cut off, but due to the market's need to clear inventory for early autumn, the market price continued to soften, falling by about half a yuan. Opening prices were 60.05 to 61 yuan for Jinxi Liyang white rice, 57 to 58 yuan for Changzhou white rice, 57 to 57.5 yuan for Hong Kong white rice, 54 to 55 yuan for sub-grade rice, and 52 yuan for broken rice.

Domestic rice such as thick and thin japonica rice has also been scarce recently. Only a little over a thousand bags arrived in the past two days. It is rumored that off-market trading is weak and prices are trending downwards. Opening prices were 65.5 to 66 yuan for Changbang clear japonica rice, 64 to 64.5 yuan for Wuxi japonica rice, 63 to 64 yuan for Changzhou Sukun japonica rice, about 60 yuan for sub-grade rice, 60 yuan for Suxi thin rice, 61 to 62 yuan for original package early rice from Nangang, and 58 to 59 yuan per dan.

Zhoupu new japonica rice has been on the market for a while, and its supply is gradually increasing, reaching no less than a hundred dan. However, due to scattered deliveries and the influence of other goods, the market is changing and showing signs of weakness. Opening prices were 60 to 61 yuan, a drop of one yuan compared to the week before.

More imported rice arrived in Shanghai yesterday, carried by the Yisheng wheel of Jardine Matheson, shipping 996 bags from Hong Kong. It arrived at the port and docked at Roosevelt Wharf yesterday morning to unload. (Ancestor)

### Japanese Flour Most Active

Due to the lack of supply of flour from Chinese factories, Japanese flour is leading the way, with total sales of nearly 20,000 bags of Phoenix brand. At the opening of the morning session, prices were still weak due to the slight unloading by traders and speculators. However, as customer sales picked up, the market turned firm. This month's price rose from 14.60 yuan to 14.65 yuan, September's price was 14.80 yuan, and October's price was 14.95 yuan. The price of inland flour remained at 14.50 to 14.60 yuan. There was no change in the prices of the Second Flour Factory. It is heard that although the Fuxin Factory has not started production, it is still selling some remaining goods.

Wheat was still considered firm yesterday. It was found that arrivals had increased slightly in the past two days. In addition to Japanese merchants transporting it to the port, Chinese merchants also had scattered arrivals of two to three thousand bags. Because French overstocking was too vigorous, although Japanese factories have good demand, they are unwilling to release goods repeatedly. It is heard that Sanxin Factory in the Pudong market purchased a ship of wheat for 11.45 yuan, while Chinese factories bid up to 13 yuan, and eventually the business was transacted smoothly.

Today, 26,000 bags of flour will be shipped to Tianjin. This flour is No. 4 flour from the Fuxin Factory and will be transported by the Xixiangtai wheel today. (Ancestor)

### Miscellaneous News: Safe Deposit Boxes Are Being Sold At Premium Prices—There Are Rumors of a Crackdown by the Banking Industry

Recently, it has been discovered that in advertisements for the sale of safe deposit boxes, the safe deposit boxes with annual rental fees of 8 to 12 yuan are being sold for premium prices ranging from 100 to 500 yuan. Mr. Ying Yongyu, a staff member of a certain association, believes that this matter is detrimental to the banking business. He suggested to the Banking Association that the transfer of safe deposit boxes and the replacement of seals should not be allowed, and that the public should be notified not to be fooled. The association believes that this kind of suggestion is beneficial to both banks and general tenants, so it has forwarded a letter to each bank for adoption and implementation. It is heard that each bank that rents out safe deposit boxes will publish an announcement, urging people not to be fooled by the sale of premium prices. Those who wish to rent safe deposit boxes can register with each bank first, so that they can rent them when they become available without paying a premium.

### Piece Goods: Early Winter Cloth Sales Pick Up

Domestic cloth: the market was stable yesterday. Spot sales in this street and in various regions of North China, Guangdong, and Hong Kong were good. Speculators were watching, with slight inflows and outflows. Market prices were stable, and the goods held by floating holders were slightly cheaper, by one to two and a half cents per piece. In this street, the inland autumn sales are gradually developing, and transactions of thick and thin velveteen, printed velveteen, blue cloth, and serge are increasing daily. Total transactions of spot goods and September futures were over 500 pieces. Guangdong and Hong Kong brokers handled over 200 pieces of colored cloth and colored twill. The Zhejiang and Fujian brokers were still facing transportation obstacles and were at a standstill.

Eastern cloth: it started weak and ended firm, mainly because practical sales in this street were quite active. Therefore, at the morning opening, Longtou fine cloth opened at 30.04 yuan, and short sellers immediately came to cover their positions. In the afternoon, it once rose to 31 yuan, and the closing price was 30.085 yuan. Medium-grade brands such as Caiqiu and Yanghe also rose by 2.5 cents per piece. The inventory of fine twill is not abundant, and the price is particularly firm. Sijunzi serge rose by 5 li per yard, and the future market price was 9.075 cents.

Export: 380 pieces of cotton cloth were shipped to Yantai today.

### Oil Market: Edible Oil Rises Again by About One Yuan

Since the oil market started to rise automatically in recent days, and with reports of rising production prices, people's sentiment has become active, and the market is filled with buying interest. "Kick the football" trading has expanded again, and the result is that it has risen by another yuan compared to last weekend. It is estimated that 100 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil were transacted, with a price of 65 yuan. In addition, 2,000 pieces of road goods were ordered for delivery in the first half of September, also at a price of 65 yuan. 100 barrels of Qingdao raw oil, priced at 93.5 yuan. 500 cans of Yantai raw oil, priced at 94 yuan. 100 pieces of Jiaozhou soybean oil, priced at 70 yuan. 70 pieces of Yanqi soybean oil, priced from 70.05 yuan to 71 yuan. 100 barrels of Dayun raw soybean oil, priced at 98 to 99 yuan, and 100 dan of Dayouyu soybean oil, priced at 77 yuan, and the old shop cake was 76 yuan.

### North and South Goods: New Honey Dates Gradually Decline

New honey dates from Jiaxing and Suzhou have continued to arrive recently, and prices are gradually softening. Yesterday, the wholesale price was 145 to 140 yuan plus, with the usual discounts for higher and lower grades. The market was mediocre, with prices about 20 yuan lower than the initial market.

### Coal: Actual Demand for Cooked Coal is Sluggish

The cooked coal market is as calm as ever, without much excitement. This is because after prices rose, actual demand gradually entered a sluggish phase, and the market price is in a state of hesitation. It is estimated that the price among traders is 160 yuan per ton ex-vehicle, and the cost of delivery to shops in this street for retail is 9 yuan per dan.

### Metals: Ribbed Steel Bars, Long Quiet, Consider Moving

Ribbed steel bars have been quiet for a long time. It is heard that Tianjin traders have recently been purchasing them slightly. Although the construction traders in this street have not fully accepted it, they are also starting to inquire about it. The market atmosphere is gradually showing signs of change. Sentiment among industry players is rising, and the market price is apparently flat but secretly tight. Yesterday's asking price of three to four cents was still 1,150 yuan, and five cents to one inch was 1,100 yuan. However, the off-market price has already shown considerable tightness. Because yesterday was a Sunday, there was no large volume of transactions, but the market trend is already quite promising.

### Statistics: Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Changes in July

Since the European war situation changed in mid-May, and France was forced to surrender, followed by the stock market crash in New York and the fall of Indian and American cotton, the Shanghai market was affected, and rapid changes occurred, namely the relaxation of the exchange rate and the sharp fall in gold prices. Speculators have been heavily hit, casting a dark shadow over Shanghai's abnormal prosperity. However, misfortunes do not come singly. There have also been changes in the world economy and political situation, such as Hong Kong strengthening its defense work, actively evacuating its population, and the sea defense being temporarily closed. The Yunnan-Vietnam transportation was blocked, and soon the Yunnan-Burma transportation was interrupted for three months. The coastal ports of Zhejiang were also tightened, and shipping was interrupted. Under such circumstances, the trade between the Shanghai market and the mainland is in the process of stagnation. The control of trade with North Buddha has been strengthened since the 26th of June, and the business of various provinces in the north has been hampered. The so-called prosperity of Shanghai is gradually eroding. We only need to see the desolation and idleness of import and export merchants' business, and the few customers in the retail stores, to see a powerful reflection. Therefore, Shanghai's commerce in July has entered a transition from prosperity to recession.

In terms of the changes in Shanghai's commercial industry in July, a total of 165 companies were affected. Analyzing the nature of these changes, the 93 cases of business transfer are the most numerous, followed by the 29 cases of share transfer, and one case each of establishment in preparation and resumption of business. The fact that the number of new openings is less than the number of closures is enough to prove how the trend of industrial and commercial development is. Here, we will further analyze the nature of the changes.

New Openings: There were 17 new openings in July, including 16 domestic businesses and 1 factory. The more important ones include Bingkang Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory, China Stock Company, Jinmen Grand Hotel, Tonghui Bank, Zhengfeng Bank, and Yihong Restaurant. The trend of new industrial and commercial openings can be said to be still in abnormal development. However, it is worth noting that the China Stock Company, after the crash of foreign stocks in mid-May, generally awakened speculators, shifted their speculative goals, and tended towards commodity stocks. If it can turn idle funds into legitimate investment, it is a very good phenomenon. The China Stock Company was established at this opportune moment and may be a prelude to guiding idle funds to the path of investment.

Establishment: In July, the Dahua Nail Factory was established after preparation.

Resumption of Business: In July, only Aoleima Chemical Company at No. 200 Jiayi Road resumed business.

Closure: There were 12 closures in July. Among them, the more important ones include Yixin Educational Supplies Manufacturing Factory, Hengyu Dyeing Workshop, Huaxing Thermos Factory, Wufu Dyeing and Weaving Factory, and Zhenfeng Bank. Since the collapse of the yarn and flower industry at the end of May, several companies still announced their liquidation in July. It can be seen that the consequences of this sharp fall in yarn prices can be said to be a serious blow. (To be continued)

Rehashing Old News Sixty-seven Years Ago (481) (See this newspaper from the twelfth year of Tongzhi of the defunct Qing Dynasty)

### Discriminating Abstinence (2)

The customs of Wu venerate ghosts and gods. Almost every household has abstinence notices pasted on their doors, virtually everywhere. Whether due to public rituals or for the sake of protecting against illness, they treat it as a serious matter and readily believe in it! Women are especially so. There are those who "abstain for life," meaning they vow never to eat meat. There are those who "repay abstinence," usually for a period of three years. There are also those who observe "Thunder Abstinence," "Guanyin Abstinence," and "Three Officials Abstinence," all of which involve abstaining on certain days of each month. During these abstinence periods, even if there are celebrations and banquets with relatives and friends, they insist on having vegetarian dishes prepared by the kitchen. Even with delicacies in front of them, they never touch meat, and people praise their piety in observing abstinence, while those who understand the principles laugh secretly. Foolish men and women faithfully follow these practices, which is truly incomprehensible. In the past, Emperor Wu of Liang was the most devout Buddhist. He offered himself to Tongtai Temple three times, and his ministers redeemed him for millions of coins. He issued an order throughout the land to use wheat cakes as substitutes for sacrifices. His actions were like a dream, and later he was trapped in Taicheng, eventually starving to death while vomiting blood, and the country followed suit. What was the reason for this? I once saw someone who had been vegetarian for several years write on a memorial a request like "Repay a Vegetarian Meal, so-and-so receive and use." I couldn't help but burst into laughter! What is a vegetarian meal? Can it be quantified? And how can it be received and used? If fasting is taken as the intent to moderate eating and be careful of desires, and to reduce killing, there is nothing wrong with the righteous way. But many of the foolish masses act unrighteously, wanting to use this as a plan to eliminate sins, and are Kengkeng who abide strictly, and they are greatly mistaken.

Miscellaneous Feelings

### "Climbing Up" and "Self-Control"

— Ding Ren

After reading "The Power of Self-Control" in this publication on the 6th of this month, I feel that there are a few points that are indeed worth discussing. Since we are fortunate enough to live and grow in this great era, on the one hand, we must dare to face reality and not escape it; on the other hand, we must never be ambiguous about the nature of the country we are growing in. Otherwise, I am afraid that even our own survival will feel disoriented!

In China, a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society, especially during the current transitional period, people often find themselves unable to find a way out and feel depressed. At the same time, due to the influence of the capitalist society that has been built and operated for decades, and the long-standing habit of living under foreigners, they cannot "self-control" and want to use the method of a few people surpassing the majority and "standing out from the crowd" to obtain their own status. But is this method feasible at present? Are there obstacles on this road? These are issues worth exploring.

First of all, the German poet Goethe said, "I want to be the master of myself." This sentence is good, but Goethe's biggest mistake was committing the fault of "individualism." He did not see that when the entire country and the entire nation cannot be their own masters, then you as an "individual" can only be a slave. This truth is undeniable and cannot be erased by anyone. There are many ready-made examples of "this kind of thing." The Jews are far away, and the wealthy and powerful people of countries such as the Czech Republic and Poland are nearby... What about them? Can they be "standing out from the crowd" and "excelling" without being expelled or bullied? The facts are the best explanation. Berlin's "anti-Jewish policy" does not distinguish between having wealth or power, or having a position. It treats and expels them all the same, and stateless people are always destined to wander and be tossed around. This is the suffering suffered by the Jewish people who take "individual" interests as a premise. Isn't the Czech Republic and Poland the same? In the end, it is all because a few people want to "preserve" their "individual interests" and are willing to be used by others, and as a result, they become "VIPs" in other people's "international hotels." These all start from individual "interests" and forget that they are part of a nation and a country, and they are rewarded with the loss of nationality. Then, with the "lessons of the past," should we Chinese people still start from the "individual," even if we know it is bad, and still "restrain, endure, be peaceful, and be content" to "climb up"? Or should we go to the broad masses of the people, be a part of the people ourselves, learn from everyone, and obtain the path to genuine self-cultivation? I think readers will choose which path to take.

Regarding "those who are parents should teach their children in a reasonable way," they should be taught how to learn to struggle and obtain the truth, rather than cultivate unconditional "endurance, peace, and contentment." Otherwise, the next generation of the Chinese nation will be even more unimaginable!

In short, I also agree with the use of "self-control," but it must be: holistic, national, and ethnic, not individual; at the same time, it must also be "hating evil like an enemy" and "getting to the bottom of things," rather than unconditionally and casually "self-control." Otherwise, the true meaning of self-control will be lost. If "self-control" is for "being qualified to manage and order others," this is the true face of some people, then that should be "discussed separately"!

### Aerial Photography by Reconnaissance Planes

— Jie Liu

The work of aerial reconnaissance first requires well-trained pilots. Secondly, pilots must also be given detailed orders, directing them to specifically reconnoiter designated locations, so as not to be clueless. Aerial reconnaissance is easier if it is limited to a small number of locations. Conversely, if the pilot must pay attention to an entire vast area for a long period of time, then the work will naturally be very difficult. Modern air forces, in order to avoid the firing of anti-aircraft guns, must fly extremely fast and very high. At the same time, the camouflage of enemy ground forces and anti-aircraft guns has also greatly improved. Therefore, the work of reconnaissance has become even more difficult. We must not forget that when the reconnaissance officer in a two-seater plane is looking at the ground or taking pictures, he is always in danger of being attacked by enemy planes. Therefore, reconnaissance planes are now gradually being changed to three-seater planes.

However, aerial photography can make up for this difficulty in reconnaissance. It has the following major advantages:

1.  Photographs can capture subtle details that the eye cannot recognize, and sometimes even observers on the ground cannot see them. (Because of the different angles). The biggest advantage of photographs is that they can be carefully studied to obtain important clues. After enlarging a clear photo, many things that reconnaissance officers cannot see can be accurately discovered. Secondly, if many photos belonging to the same area but taken at different times are studied side by side, the enemy's actions can be understood and future trends can be predicted. This is an excellent way to study the dynamics of enemy train transportation, because we can accurately calculate the number of vehicles parked in the middle of each station on the photo. Also, everything on the road, such as vehicles, troops, and even individual pedestrians, can be found from photos taken of ordinary roads.

2.  Modern automatic cameras can photograph a narrow and long area on a roll of continuous photos. This type of photography is composed of many photos, with one half of each photo being the same as one half of the photo in front of it, so that they can be compared with each other during research. However, when taking this photo, the plane must fly at the same altitude, so that the photos taken are the same size, so that the photos can be put together to form an overall picture. As for the height of the plane, it should be determined according to the size of the required photos and the width of the area being photographed. This is a job that requires great accuracy, so the plane must fly horizontally in a straight line when taking pictures. However, at this time, enemy anti-aircraft guns and fighter planes are very likely to attack; therefore, reconnaissance planes must rely on the protection of other planes to photograph the ground scene over dangerous areas.

In addition to photos taken vertically from the air to the ground, it is sometimes necessary to take oblique photos in order to discover certain important clues. Planes often have to fly very low to take these photos, which is even more dangerous. At this time, ground machine guns and even rifles can shoot it down.

Recently, bombers, after each raid, must photograph the bombed area in order to improve the accuracy of their bombing.

3.  During the recent wars between Britain, France, Germany, and Italy for colonies, there were often many areas for which no maps were available for research. Aerial photography can meet part of the needs. In addition to the above-mentioned photography methods, there is also a long-distance camera that can clearly photograph distant scenery. There is also a specially made film that can sense infrared rays, which can capture everything on the ground in foggy weather, and its clarity is no less than that of photos taken in sunny weather.

The photographers on reconnaissance planes do not seem to attract much attention, but in fact their importance is no less than that of bombers and fighters.

### Seeking the Truth

— Ling Tong

Some say that life is about striving to improve everything to seek the welfare of future generations. Some say that the meaning of life is to create the continuing life of the universe. Biology books tell us that human life in the world is to maintain and continue the life of its own species. Are you satisfied with these answers?

Henry David Thoreau once said: "The life of man is crushed by petty things; what we need is simplicity. Simplicity is our way of life. But now hypocrisy and deceit are regarded as the truth in the world, and the truth is regarded as absurd. We must put our feet into the mud that covers every part of the world - opinions, prejudices, preconceptions and fraudulent surfaces, etc. - until our feet touch a hard place, which is fact or truth. Then we can put up a sign so that we have a basis for our future days. As long as you see the truth, you can happily end your earthly career. Seeking the truth is the only purpose of life."

Seeking the truth is the purpose of life.

### Not Fabricated

— Editor

In my article "The Necessity of Lying" on August 6, there are statements such as "Children from poor families lie more than children from wealthy families; girls lie more on average than boys," etc. Recently, a reader questioned the basis for the above two points. According to the books "Clinical Psychology" by Louttit and "Studies in Deceit" by Harshorne & May, there are statistical materials published on this type. Therefore, the two points raised in the article are the results of actual research and investigation by American psychologists, and are not fabricated by me. I am hereby clarifying this to avoid misunderstanding.

Hawthorne Case

### The Fate of the Dancing Queen

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter 5 Bad News

"Has he called the [dance hall] since?"

"Not yet, we're waiting for his news."

I hung up the phone and returned to the office, feeling quite flustered. Could Hawthorne have had an accident? Shi Gui stood beside me, and although he didn't speak, his eyes were clearly filled with concerned questions.

I explained to him briefly: "Mr. Hawthorne and I separated at the Asia Hotel. I went upstairs to monitor someone who was talking to Detective Ni in the phone booth. According to the report from the police station, the call seemed to be suddenly interrupted."

Shi Gui said in a trembling voice: "Mr. Bao, do you think something might have happened to Mr. Hawthorne?"

I simply couldn't answer, but looking at Shi Gui's expression, I couldn't help but answer.

"Maybe not, Shi Gui, don't panic—"

The phone rang again. After answering, I learned that it was Ni Jinshou.

He said urgently: "Mr. Bao, is there still no news about Mr. Hawthorne?"

I replied, "No, I was just about to ask you."

He said urgently again: "The news is very bad, he has been shot! ... Okay, wait a moment, I'll be there right away."

Hawthorne was shot! How could this news not surprise me? Where was he shot? In the Asia Hotel phone booth? But when I went down the elevator, I stood for a moment in front of the elevator door and also glanced at the phone booth, but I didn't see Hawthorne. (81)

Entertainment World

### Two Major Dramas in the Gathering of Famous Actors

— Jun Mei

Famous actors from both the North and South in Shanghai will hold a gathering at the Great Stage on the 20th, 21st, 22nd, and 23rd to raise funds for the Actors' Union. The program has been announced, including dramas such as "The Dragon and Phoenix Present Auspiciousness," "Cutting Hair to Replace the Head," and "Daming Prefecture." The dramas are performed by famous actors and the arrangements are well-organized, truly worthy of being a grand gathering of elites in the Shanghai opera scene in 1940.

Looking at the programs for the three days, the most noteworthy ones are the consecutive performances of "Cutting Hair to Replace the Head" and "Daming Prefecture" featuring Shi Wengong. These two dramas were both very popular in the past opera scene. In recent years, the "star" system of opera performers has become increasingly developed, and these dramas that emphasize both sheng (male), dan (female), jing (painted face), chou (clown), and both civil and military roles have gradually become unpopular, which is a pity!

"Cutting Hair to Replace the Head" was originally a zheng gong xi (main play) for wusheng (male martial role). Since Tan Xinpei performed it as a xusheng (male role with beard), xusheng were even ashamed if they could not perform this drama. When Shuyan was at his peak, he also used this drama as an attraction. As the trend went, it changed from being a zheng gong xi for xusheng to being performed by wusheng. In this gathering, Zhou Xinfang plays Zhang Xiu, Zhao Ruquan plays Cao Cao, Furongcao plays Zou, Zhang Yipeng and Lin Shusen play the preceding and following Dian Wei, and Li Zhonglin plays Hu Che'er. The arrangement is complete and the skills are evenly matched. It is expected that the performance will allow the audience to greatly enjoy the drama.

"Daming Prefecture" tells the story of Lu Junyi being forced to go to Liangshan. The roles it contains, whether sheng, dan, jing, chou, or mo, and whether civil or military, are as important as "Cutting Hair to Replace the Head." I have often seen it in rural stage performances in the early years. At that time, when Lu Junyi played by the civil and military laosheng (old male role) Xiao Longbang, the prostitute Jia played by huadan (young female role) Haitanghong, and Li Gu played by the pockmarked Xiao Mian performed this drama in one place, people from far and near would compete to watch it. When it came to the performance of the treacherous servant and lewd woman colluding to frame the master, the audience would all point their fingers in anger. When the Liangshan heroes robbed the execution ground, there was a burst of cheers. The seriousness of the performance made people feel as if they were in the situation. In this gathering, Zhou Xinfang plays Lu Junyi, Furongcao plays Jia, Han Jinkui plays Li Gu, Zhao Ruquan plays Shi Qian, and Gai Jiaotian takes on the role of Shi Wengong. With Xinfang's sad grandeur, Tongshan's shrewishness, Jinkui's viciousness, Ruquan's experience, and Gai Jiaotian's martial skills, a perfect combination, it should also be a sensation.

### Zhao Ruquan Re-stages Lu Genrong

— Tai Wu Jushi

—Jin Taiwen Joins to Play Huang Huiru—

This year, the entertainment scene in Shanghai seems to be advocating a "retro movement." Folk stories such as "Meng Jiangnu," "Painting the Golden Phoenix," and "The Gorgeous Marriage" are being put on the silver screen by the film industry. The case of Yan Ruisheng murdering Wang Lianying, which caused a sensation twenty years ago, has been put back on the stage by the opera scene and has been playing for nearly a month, with strong ticket sales.

In view of the popularity of the new play "Yan Ruisheng" among the ordinary classes (the so-called middle-class taste), the Gong Stage has now decided to re-stage the story of a servant and mistress love affair from twelve years ago, which is "Huang Huiru and Lu Genrong."

At that time, the first theater in Shanghai to stage this play was the Shanghai Stage (now the old site of Tianchan), with Zhao Ruquan playing Lu Genrong and Zhao Junyu playing Huang Huiru. It ran for several months and the ticket sales remained strong. Three years later, Zhao Ruquan joined the Sanxing Stage and re-staged this play, and it was still able to attract audiences.

Now Zhao Ruquan will re-stage this play, which was popular twelve years ago, at the Gong Stage, with the new actress Quan Suwen playing Huang Huiru. The actors of the Gong Stage have always been known for performing new plays. In addition, the stage scenery of the Gong Stage is second to none in Shanghai. It is currently being rehearsed and will be staged after "The New Celestial River Match."

It is said that the most realistic scenes include the stock exchange market, the scenery of the Rising Sun Building, the scene of prostitutes soliciting customers and gangsters drinking tea on Fourth Avenue's Qinglian Pavilion, the East Asia Hotel, the court trial, and platforms on the stage, etc. The most exciting part is the continuously changing scenery, such as the Rising Sun Building changing into the interior scene of the Sincere Company department store, with escalators and shoppers coming and going; then changing into the elevator of the East Asia Hotel, with Huang and Lu entering hand in hand, the elevator rising from below; then changing into the interior scene of the hotel, the elevator rising from below the stage, with Huang and Lu coming out of the elevator. All of the above are changed in the fastest possible way.

Bai Yuyan is also a new and important actress hired by the Gong Stage. In this play, a scene of the entrance of the Gong Stage will be re-created on the stage, changing into the interior of the Gong Stage, with many ushers and audience members. Huang and Lu are also among the audience. A small Gong Stage will be set up on the stage, and this small stage will be used for Bai Yuyan's performances. Bai performs an old play every day, either a martial arts play with a lot of fighting or a civil play that emphasizes both singing and acting. A new play interspersed with old plays, a play within a play, is also a unique feature on the stage. The grand occasion on the day of the performance can be expected.

### Playwright Huang Zuolin, Who Studied in England, Joins the Drama and Art Society

— Lin

Directs "Small Town Story"

The Shanghai Drama and Art Society, whose summer performance is about to end, had planned to greatly enrich the talent after the autumn performance begins, and this plan is being implemented step by step. The first is that playwright Huang Zuolin, who studied in England, has joined the Drama and Art Society. Mr. Huang studied drama in England for several years and has a wealth of knowledge and experience. He is a new and capable talent among the few drama experts who have studied abroad in the country. After returning to China, he taught at the National Drama School and cultivated many young war drama talents. Now, he has been hired by the Drama and Art Society and is beginning to work on Yuan Jun's five-act comedy, "Small Town Story," with such care and seriousness. After "Night Shanghai," we will be able to see his directed works. In addition, a playwright who studied in the United States and a performer who studied in England will also join the Drama and Art Society. In terms of personnel, excellent actors working in the interior will also be invited to Shanghai to participate. At the same time, the "Summer Training Class" has also created many new talents, and it is expected that six or seven people will be admitted as formal actors. Judging from this situation, the Shanghai Drama and Art Society will have a new start after the autumn.

### About "Confucius"

— Luo Cun

The debut work of the Minhua Film Company, "Confucius," has been completely completed after filming in August. It is said that it will be premiered at the Grand Theater on the 27th of this month, Confucius's birthday. The film is directed by Fei Mu. We know his style, which has always been unhurried and not carelessly made. We believe that this director "Confucius" will definitely have a good harvest. There are a few points about the film that are worth reporting to the readers:

The entire film cost more than 16,000 feet of film, and after editing, two-thirds remained.

Scenery—such as palaces and all great buildings, were personally designed by Fei Mu's younger brother, who is a bachelor of civil engineering from a university and also has a lot of research on archaeology, so the scenery of Confucius's hometown was very carefully rebuilt. When it is premiered, we can feast our eyes.

During the filming of the scene of Zilu fighting to the death, because the performance was realistic and the fighting was too intense, one of the actors fell from a more than two-丈 high platform and was injured, and Zhang Yi also had many gun and knife wounds, which shows that all the actors worked very hard.

In order to respect "Confucius," Fei Mu asked the company not to publicly publish photos of him and Confucius together in any newspapers, which shows Mr. Fei's respectful attitude towards the sage.

It is said that film merchants from various Nanyang provinces have been rushing to buy copies of "Confucius" from Min Hua. It turns out that overseas Chinese in Nanyang have a psychology of respecting Confucius. Since the filming of "Confucius," they have paid attention to it long ago. As for the cast of the film, it is copied as follows:

Tang Huaiqiu—plays Confucius.

Murong Wan'er—plays Nanzi.

Zhang Yi—plays Zilu.

Xu Li—plays Yang Huo.

Pei Chong—plays Zigong.

Wan Xin—plays Shaozheng Mao.

Qian Yi—plays Zisi.

Challenge Answer: Red Moves First and Wins

Notice (1) We welcome answers to this game, with a time limit of one week. The first seven correct answers will receive a small reward. Please send your answers to 271 Da Lu Road. (2) If you have the Complete Collection of Chinese Chess Scores, Volume 2, or the Newly Compiled Chinese Chess Scores (thank you in advance), please send a letter to me if you are willing to part with them. New or old is fine.

Also, in the Battle General Game, change the red cannon on row 1 column 3 to row 1 column 1 (draw), otherwise red wins.

Explanation of Game 68 The red pawn advancing 1 from column 9 should be answered by the black chariot advancing 6 from column 2. The red chariot can then advance 3 from column 9, exchanging chariots and seizing the initiative. Then the black cannon moves to column 7 from column 8, to the red affair moving to column 4 from column 1, all of which are official moves. At this point, although the black side has the initiative, the red side's responses are appropriate and can maintain the balance.

Also, in the Earthworm Descending Dragon Game, black has no elephant on row 9 column 3 and a cannon on row 7 column 7. This is hereby corrected.
