### Guìhuá Army Begins Aiding Vietnam: Large-Scale Offensive Against Invading Japanese Troops; Japanese Army Counterattacks Chinese Forces; Strength of Japanese Forces Invading Vietnam Diminishes; France Declares Franco-Japanese Hanoi Accord Null and Void

Guìlín: Frontline sources from the Chinese side report that this morning, the Chinese army began aiding Vietnamese forces, launching a large-scale offensive against the Japanese army's transportation lines in the rear of Vietnam. It is said that the Chinese army is only threatening the Japanese rear and has not entered Vietnamese territory. It is also reported that the Japanese army has been forced to launch a counterattack against the Chinese forces, thereby weakening their forces invading Vietnam. It is said that the Chinese army is attacking Japanese forces in the areas of Lóngzhōu and Zhènnánkūn and their transportation lines to Vietnam. Chinese sources also report that the Japanese army has heavily reinforced its forces in order to intensify its attack on Vietnam and cope with the threat from the Chinese army in the rear. (United Press, 25th)

Tokyo: A semi-official Japanese source states that the Japanese Southern China Army Command has issued a public announcement stating that, according to the terms of the Franco-Japanese agreement, the Japanese army is scheduled to land in Haiphong today. We anticipate that this action will be carried out smoothly under the terms of the agreement. (Reuters, 25th)

Chongqing: According to unconfirmed reports, Chinese forces in southwestern Guì province will attack the rear of Japanese troops that have entered Vietnam. Here, news of French resistance is welcomed. Newspapers are saying that this is a time for struggle, not protest, and that the Chinese army should not be satisfied with defending the border but should cross into Vietnam and provide assistance to the French army. (Reuters, 25th)

Chongqing: The National Government convened a meeting yesterday to discuss the situation in Vietnam. All important personnel attended, listening to reports from Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui and Minister of Military Administration He Yingqin regarding the latest developments in Vietnam. Afterwards, it was announced that the government had decided to proceed with all actions in accordance with established policies and plans. The Yunnan provincial authorities are currently busy organizing the province's militia. Every two or three county chiefs must jointly form a detachment responsible for maintaining local order and security in peacetime and assisting the regular army in combat should the war extend to the local area. (Reuters, 25th)

Hanoi: After the Japanese army launched another fierce offensive, news from the front lines ceased this morning. According to official announcements, "The Japanese army has violated the Franco-Japanese agreement, and Vietnam finds this difficult to tolerate." Another official communiqué stated, "Japanese Southern China forces have engaged in offensive actions on the northern border, and the Vietnamese authorities vow to resist with force." However, the communiqué also stated that Vietnam will still fully implement the agreement reached last Sunday allowing a certain number of Japanese troops to enter Vietnam via Haiphong. At the same time, official sources stated that they had received assurances from Tokyo that the Japanese side had ordered the Southern China forces to cease their offensive. However, with the communications cut off from Hanoi and Lạng Sơn, it is impossible to ascertain today whether the Japanese army has indeed ceased its attacks. According to the last reports from the front lines before communications were cut off, the Japanese army was attempting to occupy the important railway route, and fierce fighting was underway in the Lạng Sơn area. Officials also stated that yesterday, the Japanese army's offensive was aimed at advancing along the key transportation routes surrounding Lạng Sơn. Although facing the French army's fortresses head-on, the Japanese army utilized the cover of darkness and did indeed cross the French defenses, advancing a certain distance. It is reported that the towns of Kexi on the Lạng Sơn-Cao Bằng road and the Luoping area along the Lạng Sơn-Mengkai road have been occupied by the Japanese army. (United Press, 25th)

Haiphong: French officials declare that, because the Japanese army continues to violate the Franco-Japanese Hanoi agreement, attempting to forcefully enter Vietnamese territory, the French side has deemed the agreement null and void. (Reuters, 25th)

Hong Kong: Following the Japanese invasion of Vietnam, the situation in Vietnam has become tense. Naval authorities in Hong Kong issued orders on the morning of the 25th for all British ships to temporarily cease sailing to Vietnam. Telegrams between Hong Kong and Vietnam are still functioning today. (25th dispatch)

Chongqing: An English newspaper recently advised Vietnam to continue resisting the Japanese Southern China forces and appealed to Britain and the United States to take swift action to halt Japan's southward advance. The newspaper stated, "The Far Eastern Munich agreement established in Hanoi has resulted in Vietnamese troops under the leadership of French officers resisting the Japanese army, which is truly an unexpected development. The Japanese believed that honest Frenchmen might allow them to enter Vietnam and become conquerors, but now they have encountered armed resistance from the French garrison. China is now advising Vietnam to do its utmost to resist Japan, knowing that the truth of 'seeking life in death' has been demonstrated by China's actions over the past three years. The crisis in the Pacific has reached an extremely dangerous point, and all related countries must unite against Japan. However, although the situation is dangerous, it is not beyond rescue. What is needed now is swift action without hesitation to restrain Japan." (United Press, 25th)

French Troops in Lạng Sơn Firmly Defend the Chén Di Fortress, Resisting the Andō Unit

Hong Kong: All ships sailing between Vietnam and Guangzhou Bay have been ordered to cease sailing. It is reported that the situation in Vietnam has completely come to a standstill. Chinese military sources say that Andō, the commander of the Japanese Southern China Army directing the invasion of Vietnam, has received increased assistance from several Japanese military leaders in Tokyo and Nanjing. News arriving here from Hanoi says that 10,000 French troops south of Lạng Sơn and Đồng Đăng are digging trenches to defend solid positions, resisting troops under Andō. Chinese sources added this evening that Major General Nishihara of the Japanese-Vietnam military delegation has so far failed in his efforts to dissuade Andō from invading Vietnam. General Andō has instead gained the support of Japanese military leaders from across China. (International Dispatch, 25th)

Hanoi: The Japanese army in Southern China has evidently disregarded the Franco-Japanese agreement signed here on Sunday. Yesterday afternoon, it renewed its large-scale attack on the Vietnamese border. According to French sources, the Japanese army's offensive is again focused on the area surrounding Lạng Sơn, an important railway town where the Japanese suffered heavy losses when they were repelled the day before yesterday. Unconfirmed reports received here say that French troops captured 200 Japanese soldiers on Monday. The official French casualty list currently includes only 20 deaths. A hospital train that arrived here on Monday night carried 100 wounded soldiers. French troops in Vietnam yesterday were on alert, awaiting the second step of the Japanese army. There were several small skirmishes yesterday morning near Lạng Sơn along the Guangxi border, but the major fighting only resumed in the afternoon. Nishihara, the head of the Japanese military delegation, left here for Chinese territory, reportedly planning to persuade the Guangzhou army to stop attacking Vietnam. There has been no news since Nishihara left, and it is believed that he has arrived in Guangzhou or Hainan Island. After the French government renounced the Hanoi agreement concluded last Sunday, it announced last night that the entire situation depends on whether Major General Nishihara succeeds in persuading the Guangzhou army to leave Vietnam. Japanese transport ships in Haiphong began lowering their boats yesterday morning in preparation for landing troops, but then raised the boats again and sailed out of Haiphong in an unknown direction. A third air raid alert was issued in Hanoi yesterday at noon, but no Japanese planes appeared. Yesterday, posters were found on the walls here, telling residents without important business to evacuate quickly. The Japanese side notified France that it would launch a major offensive at dawn and begin bombing Haiphong. However, the situation on the border between Vietnam and Guangxi was quiet yesterday morning. French and Japanese troops were dug in facing each other. Border sources say that French troops have recaptured Đồng Đăng. Annamese troops offered strong resistance to the Japanese army. Observers returning from the border say that the Japanese attack on Lạng Sơn suffered extremely heavy losses. The cannons of the strong French fortresses in the Lạng Sơn area caused heavy casualties to the Japanese army. They said that the roadsides were piled with Japanese soldiers' corpses. Because the Japanese army was unable to bury these bodies, it cut off both hands of each corpse so that they could be identified by fingerprints later. French troops at each stronghold have now been ordered not to open fire until the Japanese army does so first. Twelve Japanese bombers flew over Haiphong this morning in a show of force but did not drop bombs. French anti-aircraft guns did not fire on them. Schools here are now closed, and citizens are evacuating as advised by the newspapers. The Chinese consul has also advised Chinese residents to gradually evacuate. (United Press, 25th)

Haiphong: French and Japanese troops in northern Vietnam exchanged small-scale rifle and machine gun fire yesterday afternoon, but otherwise the situation appeared outwardly calm. It is widely believed that Japanese representative Nishihara is now heading to Hainan Island to meet with Andō, the commander of the Japanese Southern China Army, today. Andō is dissatisfied with the recently concluded Hanoi agreement and plans to launch a large-scale offensive against Vietnam by land, sea, and air, while Nishihara plans to dissuade him. At the same time, the French side is preparing everything to resist any Japanese actions outside the scope of the agreement. (Reuters, 25th)

Japanese Southern China Army Invades Vietnam: France Lodges Protest with Japan

Vichy: The French government protested to Japan yesterday, criticizing it for allowing the Japanese Southern China Army to invade Vietnam. The French protest formally declared that Japan should bear responsibility for the fighting on the Vietnamese border. It is said that the protest accused Japan of violating the Hanoi agreement, because the agreement only permitted Japanese troops to enter Vietnam via Haiphong, not via Guangxi. At the same time, the Chinese embassy announced that the Chinese government had delivered a written protest to the French government, protesting the content of the Hanoi agreement. The Chinese protest stated, "This agreement allows the Japanese army to wage war against China, which violates all of France's treaty obligations and is contrary to the spirit of French diplomatic neutrality and good neighborliness." A spokesman for the Chinese embassy said that China had repeatedly denied that Chinese troops had crossed the border before the Franco-Japanese agreement was signed on Sunday. (United Press, 25th)

Vichy: Regarding the conflict between French and Japanese forces in northern Vietnam, an official statement was recently issued here, refuting the remarks of Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma. It stated that, according to the Franco-Japanese agreement of the 22nd of this month, the Japanese air force may use three airfields in northern Vietnam, and the ground troops protecting these airfields must land in Haiphong. In addition, the agreement clearly stipulates that if the Japanese army makes other movements, it must obtain the prior consent of the French side. The above points were communicated by the Japanese negotiators to the commander of the Japanese army on the Guangxi border in China. Unexpectedly, some units of the Japanese army there violated the agreement and marched into northern Vietnam. French outposts immediately opened fire and resisted. The French ambassador to Japan is currently in talks with the Japanese Foreign Ministry to discuss a solution. (Havas, 24th)

Hong Kong: According to late news from Hanoi received here this morning, the Japanese army in Guangzhou attempted to invade Vietnam from the Lạng Sơn area on Tuesday afternoon. News from Hanoi also said that the fighting was scheduled to stop at noon on Sunday, but after the Japanese army reinforced the Lạng Sơn area, it continued its offensive in the afternoon. Another report said that Vietnamese troops captured 200 Japanese soldiers. The French side admitted that French casualties numbered 20 killed and wounded. Those close to the commander of the Japanese army in Guangzhou have described a conflict that occurred today between the Japanese army and diplomatic personnel in Tokyo. It is said that the commander of the Japanese Southern China Army claimed that the move to enter Vietnam was his own idea and insisted that his Japanese troops stationed in Guì must enter Vietnam. The Guangzhou Japanese army's wireless telegraph station was the first to "point out" that the Vietnamese authorities were allowing goods to be transported to Chongqing and providing assistance to Chongqing. Tokyo's adoption of the policy of entering Vietnam was due to this. (International News Service, 25th)

French Ambassador to the United States Says He Will Invite Chinese Troops to Enter Vietnam to Provide Assistance

Washington: The French Ambassador to the United States, Henry Haye, issued a statement last night stating that France has decided to resist any actions by the Japanese army that exceed the scope of the Franco-Japanese Vietnam agreement by all possible means. The Japanese army has violated the Franco-Japanese agreement and attacked key points in Vietnam. Our determination to defend Vietnam in accordance with the signed agreement remains unchanged. (Reuters, 25th)

Washington: French Ambassador to Washington Henry Haye declared last night that French troops in Vietnam will resist the Japanese invasion and will invite Chinese troops to enter Vietnam to assist French troops in fighting against Japan. He said that French troops will resist the Japanese offensive regardless of the disparity in numbers. He expressed hope that Chinese troops could assist French troops, "as promised in the repeated official statements issued by Chongqing last month." The French ambassador said that he had not yet received reports to confirm that Chinese troops had entered Vietnam. Mr. Haye also said that he was confident that the United States understood and sympathized with France's position in Vietnam. He said that rumors that the United States had previously approved France's concessions to Japan in the Hanoi agreement were not true. He said that the US government was kept informed of the negotiations at the time, and the agreement concluded in Hanoi on Sunday has already been effectively cancelled due to the Japanese side's violation of the terms of the agreement. The French ambassador said that if France were in the same position as before the European war, it would not make any concessions to Japan. He said, "However, under these circumstances, we must deal with reality." (United Press, 25th)

Editorial

### The Once Again Tumultuous Vietnam Problem

The Franco-Japanese-Vietnamese negotiations, which have been in turmoil for three months, were concluded with the signing of an agreement at the last moment before the expiration of the Japanese ultimatum, for the sake of building a "new order in East Asia" and "granting certain military conveniences to the Japanese army." As a result, Vietnam not only failed to preserve the integrity of its sovereignty and territory, but also failed to enjoy even a moment of temporary peace. For three days and nights, the tragic calamity of war has continued to engulf the Vietnamese border, forcing the French and Vietnamese authorities, after succumbing, to reiterate their determination to resist. The entire eastern hemisphere has also been stimulated by this strange and abnormal change, and feels even more strongly that it cannot stand idly by in the face of the crisis in the Far East. It is difficult to say with certainty at this point what the end result of this development will be, but the previous humiliation of the French and Vietnamese is all the more proof of a great misjudgment. To seek complete preservation through submission is already a bitter state of mind, and if one can be fortunate enough to obtain complete preservation, then even if one suffers the blame of being unjust and cowardly, one can still use the excuse of complete preservation as a way to justify oneself. But now, humiliation has been added without safety, and one cannot but try to cheer oneself up in the midst of bitterness, and re-drum up the remaining courage of a once-despondent spirit. Their situation is certainly worthy of sympathy, but also greatly regrettable.

The mistake of the French and Vietnamese lies in their gullibility: first, they mistakenly believed that the Japanese side would definitely keep its word, and that once the treaty was concluded, they could still maintain the rights outside the treaty; second, they fundamentally did not recognize the Japanese side's habitual use of dual or even multiple diplomacy, and believed that the parties involved in the negotiations could represent the entire other side. They did not expect that the ink of the signed treaty would not be dry before the clash of arms arose on the border. Faithlessness and breach of treaty, disregard for morality, is indeed what today's aggressors excel at, but the breach of a treaty occurring at the same time as the signing of the treaty is still unheard of in the past. Judging from Germany and Italy's acceptance of France's surrender this summer, once the treaty was concluded, it was done and finished, and there was no repeated quarreling or insatiable demands. They, as victorious countries, did not go too far against the defeated countries, so what Japan is doing to the French and Vietnamese now is truly difficult to imagine with common sense. The world often equates Germany and Italy with Japan, and lists them together as aggressive countries, but looking at them now, how vastly different are they from each other? The term aggression is certainly not enough to encompass the significant differences between them, which is what the world should deeply recognize.

The future of Vietnam hinges not on the French and Vietnamese, but on the Japanese; not on the Vichy and Hanoi authorities, but on the French and Vietnamese military and civilians; not on the relationship between the French and Vietnamese and Japan, but on the movements of the powers surrounding the Vietnam problem. The resurgence of this Vietnamese-Japanese dispute stems from the Japanese side violating the limits allowed by the treaty, not because the French and Vietnamese authorities fundamentally regretted their decision. If the Japanese side could rein in its horses at the precipice and obey the law, taking what is permitted by the treaty as the starting point for further actions, then it might not be impossible to obtain its desired rights and interests in a more gentle manner, and the French and Vietnamese authorities, fearing the harm of a cold alliance, would not be difficult to take action. Therefore, it is said that it does not depend on the French and Vietnamese, but on the Japanese. At this moment, the Vichy and Hanoi authorities are at a crossroads of war and peace, and the world should not hesitate to encourage them, hoping that they will become stronger, and make up for their mistakes. However, judging from their current situation, if Germany and Italy do not strongly support them, they will certainly not be able to resolutely reject the humiliation of Vietnam amidst the thorns and thistles. Then, instead of focusing on the French and Vietnamese authorities, it is better to place hope in the loyal and brave military and civilians of the French and Vietnamese. Only these military and civilians can correct their past mistakes and strive for a new future for defeated France. Therefore, it is said that it does not depend on the French and Vietnamese authorities, but on the French and Vietnamese military and civilians. This time, the French and Vietnamese blamed the meager assistance of Britain and the United States for their submission, which only proves that they initially lacked the determination to resist. The task of defending Vietnam is indeed not something that the French and Vietnamese alone can accomplish today. China has already shown the world its determination. As for whether the statement of Britain and the United States that they will not allow the status quo of Vietnam to change can be effective, it depends only on whether they can immediately take positive and effective action in addition to the joint defense measures under consideration. Therefore, it is said that it does not depend on the French and Vietnamese and Japan, but on the relevant powers. This is not to underestimate the French and Vietnamese authorities, but their recent announcements only make people more pessimistic about their future. French Ambassador to the United States Henry Haye did make the statement yesterday that the Vietnamese-Japanese agreement has been cancelled due to the Japanese side's breach of the agreement. This voice from an empty valley is valuable, but unfortunately it still lacks strong evidence to prove that it is indeed true.

The two sets of wars in the Far East and Europe have always been conducted separately under different natures and scopes. Since the deterioration of the Vietnam dispute, the world's perception has been that these two sets of wars are likely to merge into one with Vietnam as the opportunity, and the Axis power Italy also attaches great importance to Japan's invasion of Vietnam, saying that it is a major threat to Britain. In fact, so far, Japan's diplomatic stance is still aloof from the belligerent countries of the European war, without any left or right or partiality, and only seeking to expand its own rights and interests. Japan's deep cultivation of power in Southeast Asia is indeed a concern for Britain and the United States, but how is it fortunate for Germany and Italy? Rather than seeing this as Japan's response to the Axis countries, it is better to say that it intends to take the initiative before Germany and Italy have secured a definite victory, in order to prevent Germany and Italy from seizing a share of the defeated countries' territories in the South Pacific. On the other hand, it also shows that the past concessions made by Britain and the United States to Japan in the hope of gaining its assistance were all in vain. Having learned this lesson, there is no need to worry too much in the future, and only harm oneself. The European war and the Far Eastern crisis have always belonged to two different natures and two different categories. The Vietnam problem is certainly enough to affect the powers, and the more the dispute expands, the wider and deeper the involvement will be, but how can it affect the advance and retreat of the belligerent countries on both sides of Europe? Moreover, it will not cause the confluence of the two sets of wars in Europe and Asia, which is what can be asserted at this moment.

### England and America Watch the Far Eastern Situation, Will Take Joint Action, Send Fleets to Reinforce Singapore, America Intensifies the Embargo Against Japan

Washington - Confidence has increased here last night that England and America are considering taking joint action to "stop" Japan's deep advance into Southeast Asia. Unofficial but highly reliable sources say that both England and America will not allow Japan to invade French Vietnam, and Japan's threats to Singapore and the Dutch East Indies will also not be ignored. These sources say that the Roosevelt government will regard Japan's invasion of Vietnam as the most serious act of undermining the status quo in the Far East since Japan launched the war in Shanghai. As of last night, although England and America have not yet indicated what action they will take immediately, authoritative sources believe that the government will probably not make any more protests. It is said that the executive authorities have stopped all empty talk, and will take practical actions from now on. According to reliable sources, Britain is preparing to send a strong fleet to reinforce the Far East, especially Singapore. Indications here are that British first-class warships do not need to participate fully in the war in the British mainland for the time being. These sources also say that according to reliable sources, Britain believes it can send several teams of Mediterranean naval forces to the Far East. Another unconfirmed report says that the United States may send a part of the main force of the Hawaiian navy to reinforce the US fleet that will go to Singapore. At the same time, Republican Representative Rogers told reporters that she believes that the United States is currently negotiating with Britain so that the United States can lease other British naval bases in the Far East in addition to the Singapore naval port. She said that although she cannot predict what kind of plan the executive authorities will take, she firmly believes that the decision to sell destroyers to Britain has already indicated that the two countries may establish another agreement of the same nature. (United Press Agency, 25th)

Washington - Secretary of State Hull told reporters that the United States is now waiting for more accurate information about the development of the Vietnam issue before taking special steps to deal with Japan's activities. Hull was unwilling to discuss whether the United States could assist the French army in Vietnam in resisting the war, and whether the United States had already or would protest against Japan. Hull also stated that he had not heard any official news that a part of the US fleet currently stationed in Hawaii would be transferred to the Atlantic Ocean. (Reuters, 25th)

Washington - Reliable sources here said today that it is inevitable that the US will intensify its ban on the transportation of military supplies to Japan. They also predicted that President Roosevelt will soon order that various oils, as well as scrap iron, or even copper, must be subject to export license control. This export license system will allow the National Defense Committee to transport these materials to Britain, but not to Japan. Secretary of State Hull told the press today that State Department officials had a meeting, and what they discussed was the situation in the Far East. Hull said, "We are now focusing on all developments in the Pacific." (International News Agency, 25th)

Tokyo - A spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry admitted today that Japanese government leaders are expecting the United States to retaliate against Japan's invasion of Vietnam. However, the spokesman said that this kind of action will not have any impact on Japan's policy. (International News Agency, 25th)

Rumor: Germany and Japan Will Form an Alliance to Confront the Joint Defense Line of Britain and America

Washington - Reliable sources say that Japan and Germany have agreed in principle to form a "defensive alliance" to counter the joint front of Britain and the United States in the Pacific and Atlantic. The purpose of this alliance, as suggested by the German side, is to try to divert the attention of the United States in all aspects, so that it cannot devote all its efforts to helping Britain. Officials here refused to comment immediately on the news of the German-Japanese alliance. This news was transmitted to Washington a few hours after President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull studied the official report on Japan's invasion of Vietnam in the White House. Hull went to the White House after dinner last night and discussed the situation in the Far East with President Roosevelt for a long time. This shows that the US government has paid close attention to Japan's actions in the Far East. However, the US government did not take any action last night, and Washington officials privately admitted that Japan's actions in the Far East have made the United States feel very uneasy. It is heard that the agreement in principle reached by Japan and Germany on the alliance was approved by the Royal Conference in Tokyo on September 19. As soon as the Japanese Privy Council officially approves it, the German-Japanese alliance will be announced in Tokyo. It is also heard that Germany has taken on the task of mediating the rapprochement between the Soviet Union and Japan, or will promote the conclusion of a mutual non-aggression treaty between the Soviet Union and Japan, so that Japan can act freely in southern Asia. Recently, Thailand sent an important delegation to Japan, which made some people believe that the German-Japanese alliance may enable Japan and Thailand to cooperate militarily in southern Asia. This action will be easier to achieve due to Japan's attack on Vietnam, and this action is also a serious threat to Singapore and a help to Germany's policy of dividing the British Empire. It is generally believed that if Britain and the United States establish cooperation in the Pacific to stop Japan's southward advance, then the rumored German-Japanese alliance can be realized. If Britain and the United States announce an agreement to deal with the Far East, such as the US fleet using the Singapore naval base, then Japan will abandon its policy of not joining the European war. Japan will then continue its southward process and eventually attack the source of raw materials for Britain and the United States. At that time, Germany will also intensify its attacks on Britain and create political turmoil in South America to prevent Britain and the United States from retaliating against Japan. This kind of action by Germany will divert the attention of the United States to the Pacific and Europe. It is heard that the rumored German-Japanese defensive alliance has been strongly promoted in Tokyo by Stadmayer, a confidant representative of German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. (United Press Agency, 25th)

Berlin - German authoritative sources recently did not express acknowledgement of the news that Germany and Japan have reached an agreement in principle on a defensive alliance, saying, "We cannot deny that we know nothing." (United Press Agency, 25th)

Although Washington government officials have received news about the German-Japanese alliance, they do not know whether this news is accurate. They do not doubt the diplomatic cooperation between Germany and Japan, but they believe that this news is a test balloon to test the attitudes of various countries in the world, especially the attitude of the United States. It is generally believed that this agreement will make Japan openly go to war with Britain and increase the tension between the United States and Japan. (United Press Agency, 25th)

### The Chinese Army in Southern Shanxi Fiercely Attacks the Suburbs of Qinshui City and Destroys Japanese Transportation Near Anyi

Luoyang - Most of the outposts surrounding Yangcheng have been captured by the Chinese army, and fierce fighting is now taking place in the city gates. On the evening of the 20th, the Chinese army divided and attacked the Japanese at Liucun Town, Couple Ridge, and various outposts in the suburbs of Qinshui City between the Yangcheng-Qinshui Highway, killing more than a hundred people and thoroughly destroying the transportation in various places. The Japanese reinforcements were cut off and are being surrounded and annihilated by the Chinese army. (14th telegram)

Luoyang - On the evening of the 20th, the Chinese army once again fiercely attacked the front and back beaches (southeast of Anyi).

### The Chinese Army in the Reclaimed Areas of Southern Jiangsu is Powerful

Tunxi - A reporter met a general from the reclaimed areas of southern Jiangsu in the front line of a certain place. According to the conversation, the current situation in the reclaimed areas of southern Jiangsu is as follows: Although many cities in southern Jiangsu have fallen into the hands of the Japanese, the Japanese forces still cannot leave the city gates even a single step. In recent years, China has made leapfrog progress in politics, and the unification of the party, government, and army has been thoroughly achieved. Moreover, in this vast reclaimed area, not only is the Chinese political power still deeply rooted, but also the judicial power can still be executed. Now, in order to strengthen the political power at the grassroots level, the Jiangnan Administrative Office is actively training the Baojia chiefs, and the county magistrates of various counties also go out on patrol from time to time to summon the township chiefs and the masses to give speeches. The general mood is still very excited, and the military power is also growing stronger. Recently, it has controlled the Beijing-Shanghai Railway and the Shanghai-Hangzhou National Highway. Therefore, the suspension of traffic and the overturning of vehicles are often heard. (24th telegram)

Tunxi - On the afternoon of the 23rd, a part of a Chinese army unit attacked Zhuzong Town in northern Jintan, destroying the Japanese fortifications and damaging more than ten kilometers of the highway from Jintan to Xuepu, and destroying the No. 5 and No. 12 bridges on the road. (24th telegram)

### The Scene in Guling is Desolate

A reporter from a certain place in northern Jiangxi was not far from Mount Lu. He heard from people from Guling that Guling this summer is one of the most desolate years in the past 20 years. There are few tourists on the mountain, and the shops in the city are deserted. China Travel Service has already closed down, and the porters have also dispersed. The Japanese army at the foot of the mountain has very strict restrictions on tourists on the mountain. Even if missionaries from third countries want to enter the mountain, they are often prevented. However, the Chinese guerrillas around Mount Lu are very active, and gunshots are heard all night long. Those who live in Guling are always startled several times a night. (25th telegram)

### Briefing

Chengdu - Li Chongliang, a gentry from Wushan County, destroyed his family to relieve the national crisis and donated 500 piculs of military grain. The provincial government has sent a telegram to commend him. (25th telegram)

Hong Kong - Zhang Shanzi, a famous painter, arrived in Hong Kong from Shantou on the morning of the 25th. (25th telegram)

### The Central Standing Committee Decided to Postpone the Convening of the National Assembly, Expand the Powers of the National Political Council, Appropriately Increase the Number of Councilors, and Complete the Production Procedures Within This Year

Chongqing - Recently, the Central Government has made two major decisions regarding the National Assembly and the National Political Council:

National Assembly

Regarding the National Assembly, the Central Committee's 157th Standing Committee made the following resolutions: The National Assembly was originally scheduled to be convened on November 12 this year, and the government has instructed the National Assembly Election General Office to continue to investigate the elections that have not yet been completed in some areas and have not yet been reported to the office, and to find ways to complete various procedures. Recently, according to the report of the office, although the investigation procedures have been largely completed, transportation in various places has been greatly inconvenienced due to the impact of the war. If the meeting is convened according to the original deadline, there will be major difficulties. After careful consideration, the Council believes that the convening date of the National Assembly should be determined separately. All unfinished election matters should still be handled actively by the Election General Office under the responsibility of the government. All matters related to the construction of the venue and the reception of representatives should also be quickly formulated by the Election General Office to establish a National Assembly Preparatory Committee to be responsible for presiding over the meeting. The Preparatory Committee should be established within October of this year.

National Political Council

Regarding the National Political Council, the Central Committee's 158th Standing Committee made the following two resolutions:

(1) The term of the National Political Council expires in October of this year, and it has been more than two years since the retrospective examination. The National Political Council has made great contributions to the unity of the whole country and the promotion of the work of resisting the war and building the country. It is appropriate to continue to convene it to comply with the provisions of the guidelines for resisting the war and building the country. Now, with reference to the experience of the past two years and the expectations of people from all walks of life, the method of producing councilors will be improved, the number of councilors will be appropriately increased, and the powers of the National Political Council and the resident committee will be expanded. The chairmanship system will be changed to a central seat system, with the aim of promoting the collection of opinions and broadening the benefits of thinking.

(2) The second National Political Council should complete all production procedures in November of the 29th year of the Republic of China in accordance with the revised National Political Council Organization Regulations, and wait for the convening date.

Revised National Political Council Organization Regulations

It is heard that the revised National Political Council Organization Regulations have been decided by the Central Committee and sent to the National Government for promulgation. The original text is as follows:

Article 1: The National Government establishes the National Political Council during the war of resistance for the purpose of collecting opinions and uniting the strength of the whole country.

Article 2: Any man or woman with the nationality of the Republic of China who is 30 years old or older

### A Turning Point in Anglo-French Relations: The Battle for Dakar Continues; British Fleet Continues Fierce Bombardment of the Coast; Free French Forces Repelled Six Times in Landing Attempts

VICHY: French newspapers generally regard the British naval attack on the French-held port of Dakar in West Africa as a turning point in the history of Anglo-French relations. "Le Journal de Paris" declared that de Gaulle had guaranteed that he would never attack France, but now he has broken his word and relied on the British navy to massacre his compatriots, a clear act of treason. "Le Débats" also condemned the attack on Dakar as a "mad crime." (Haitong Telegram, 25th)

LONDON: It is reported that the admiral leading the British fleet attacking Dakar issued an ultimatum demanding the port's surrender. After being rejected, the battle for Dakar is continuing fiercely. The Vichy government admits that the French submarine "Persée" has been sunk by the British, but claims that General de Gaulle's troops were repelled four times while attempting to land at Rufisque and twice at Dakar. London claimed today that while actions to prevent French Equatorial Africa from falling into German hands are continuing, there is no doubt that French Equatorial Africa will ultimately be under the Free French flag, thanks to General de Gaulle's spirit, determination, and the patriotism of the military and civilians. According to a communiqué issued by the Free French Forces headquarters, General de Gaulle decided to attack Dakar only when Germans and Italians invaded West Africa and controlled air bases there. The attacking forces include the army, navy, and air force. The Free French navy escorts the French forces, while the British navy provides supplementary protection against possible German attacks. The Dakar authorities bear the responsibility for initiating hostilities, as they opened fire on French ships while the French forces were attempting a peaceful landing, resulting in several deaths and injuries among the crew. To avoid French fighting against French, General de Gaulle withdrew his forces to a distant anchorage. However, the Dakar authorities continued to bombard the French forces, prompting the British ships to take action. Since the armistice, French West Africa has shown various signs and actions supporting the continued resistance initiated by General de Gaulle. (Reuters Telegram, 25th)

VICHY: An official communiqué recently announced that the British fleet bombarded the French West African port of Dakar from 9:30 AM to 10:30 AM yesterday, while British aircraft bombed the French battleship "Richelieu" (which was previously heavily damaged by British warships in Oran, North Africa, and has not yet been repaired), but missed. French coastal artillery and air force returned fire. A British cruiser was hit by a large bomb. In the battle, 120 French soldiers and sailors were killed, and 138 were injured. Among the civilians, 62 were killed, and 225 were injured. The British fleet resumed bombardment at 1:00 PM, lasting for 30 minutes. The number of casualties is not yet known, but it must be higher than in the morning. (Havas Telegram, 25th)

LONDON: News arriving here this morning states that in the narrow harbor of Dakar, which can only perform broadside firing maneuvers, more than a dozen British warships exchanged fire with seven French warships last night. Two British battleships, four cruisers, and several auxiliary ships repeatedly fired broadsides at the French fleet and the port of Dakar after the French West African governor rejected the second ultimatum demanding surrender. According to official sources here, the attempt by General de Gaulle's "Free French Forces" to land was abandoned when the Dakar garrison opened fire on de Gaulle's troops. However, the official also indicated that the British navy will soon control the situation and will be able to send sufficient troops to land and fight the Dakar garrison, estimated at 5,000 men. British authorities here say that the French warships in the port of Dakar have been heavily damaged, and the shore has also been severely bombarded by British naval guns. (International Telegram, 25th)

LONDON: It is widely believed here that the British attack on the port of Dakar is a prelude to a large-scale strategic offensive against Germany. Therefore, the British action is not only intended to seize control of French Africa from the Vichy government. The diplomatic community is confident that if General de Gaulle's first attack on Dakar is successful, he will drive straight along the North African coast and achieve the goal of obtaining a base for operations against Germany. This plan was conceived by former French Prime Minister Paul Reynaud, but the plan was abandoned when Pétain took power. Since the governors of the French colonies succumbed to Pétain, Reynaud's plan to attack from North Africa failed. However, de Gaulle's followers are convinced that the French military and civilians are willing to continue the northern war. (Editor's Note: A large portion of the news has been deleted here.) The greatest feature of the British war is that even with cruel German air raids, Britain can still send its troops to fight in various places. Therefore, Britain has thwarted Hitler's main goal, as the Germans have failed to prevent the British from sending reinforcements to key points in Africa and the Mediterranean. Britain has already sent a large number of reinforcements, and the victory of the Axis powers in the African war is by no means certain. Another result of the expansion of de Gaulle's front may be to increase pressure on Spain to stay out of the war and not succumb to the temptation of the Axis powers. (International News Agency Telegram, 25th)

French Statement on the Progress of the Battle: One French Submarine Sunk

VICHY: A communiqué from the French Naval Department announced the sinking of a French submarine in Dakar, stating that on the 23rd of this month, a British fleet consisting of two battleships, cruisers, destroyers, and several transport ships arrived off the port of Dakar. De Gaulle issued an ultimatum demanding the surrender of the city's French authorities. Upon rejection, the British fleet opened fire on Dakar. During the exchange of fire, the French submarine "Persée" bravely attacked a British cruiser but was sunk, with most of the crew killed. However, the British cruiser was also hit. De Gaulle commanded his troops to attempt landings four times at Rufisque and twice at Dakar, but all were repelled. Facing this setback, the British fleet sent a second ultimatum at 1:30 PM, stating that if the city was not surrendered before 6:00 PM on the 24th, they would have to attack Dakar with the British army, destroy the port's fortifications, and occupy it. The French governor replied, "France has entrusted Dakar to me, and I will defend Dakar to the end." At this point, the battle resumed. (Reuters Telegram, 25th)

Note: The sunken French submarine "Persée" had a surface displacement of 1,379 tons and a submerged displacement of 2,060 tons, with a crew of 63 men. It was equipped with 11 torpedo tubes, one 4-inch gun, one 3.7-inch anti-aircraft gun, and one machine gun. Most of the crew escaped. (Haitong Telegram, 15th)

French Aircraft Bomb Gibraltar: Retaliatory Measures Against Britain

VICHY: An official announcement declared that French aircraft today heavily bombed Gibraltar, turning the entire strait into a "sea of flames." It is widely believed that the French ordered the bombing of Gibraltar as a "retaliatory measure" for the British attack on the port of Dakar. (International News Agency Telegram, 25th)

GIBRALTAR: A communiqué issued here states that more than 20 French-style aircraft flew to Gibraltar on Tuesday and dropped over a hundred bombs, at least one of which was shot down. The explosions killed four people and injured several others. Houses and roads were also damaged by the bombs. Three small fires broke out and were quickly extinguished. Several bombs exploded in the neutral zone separating Gibraltar from La Línea, Spain. (Reuters Telegram, 25th)

VICHY: According to a French government communiqué, in retaliation for the British bombardment of the port of Dakar, the French Air Force bombed the port of Gibraltar yesterday afternoon from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM, dropping 45 tons of bombs on the armory and seaport, hitting one ship and starting fires in various locations. British anti-aircraft guns fired fiercely, but the French aircraft returned safely. (Haitong Telegram, 25th)

MADRID: A report from Algeciras states that a British fleet, including one cruiser, four destroyers, and two submarines, sailed through the Strait of Gibraltar and headed towards the Atlantic Ocean. It is expected that the British fleet is heading to attack French colonies in Africa. (Haitong Telegram, 25th)

U.S. Authorities Closely Monitor the Development of the Battle for Dakar

WASHINGTON: Officials here are closely monitoring the development of the war in Dakar, as the scope of the war is closer to the Western Hemisphere than any previous war. However, officials emphasize that the war does not directly affect the United States for the time being. The military significance of Dakar has been the subject of much discussion here in recent months, as Dakar is located on the opposite side of the Atlantic Ocean from South America, only 1,600 nautical miles from Brazil. Observers believe that French military leader General de Gaulle and his ally Britain will not allow Dakar to fall into German hands and become a base for attacks on British shipping. Since the blockade of the Mediterranean, American shipping to West Africa has increased considerably. Therefore, it is generally believed that the U.S. fleet may request the use of Freetown, a British naval base 550 miles south of Dakar. It is also noteworthy that the United States established a consulate in Dakar in August, which the press considers to be the establishment of an American "outpost." (United Press Telegram, 25th)

WASHINGTON: Diplomatic and military circles here revealed today that the German high command secretly planned to use Dakar as a submarine base and establish an air station and radio station there to maintain contact with the German espionage network in South America in order to gain ultimate control of the Western Hemisphere. This plan was underway before the British fleet attacked the capital of this French colony. The British plan to occupy the port is therefore the reason. It is reported that the Germans attempted to open a commercial air route to disguise a military aircraft base in Dakar. The Germans had already dispatched 500 technicians to Dakar to expand the existing air base, build a large radio station, and transform the old French naval base. Once the naval base is completed, German submarines will be able to navigate the South Atlantic at will. Germany also hoped to use the name of the former "Air France" to open regular mail and passenger flights between Paris, Dakar, and Natal. American military circles are concerned about Germany's plan to make Dakar a strong German base, pointing out that Dakar is located on the protruding point of Africa, closest to the eastward protruding point of Brazil in South America. Dakar is only 2,000 miles from Pernambuco, which is within the range of a strong navy. (International Telegram, 25th)

### French Naval Chief Issues Proclamation: Vehemently Condemns Britain

VICHY: Following the British fleet's shelling of the French West African port of Dakar, French Naval Minister Darlan issued a proclamation to the nation's naval officers and men, vehemently condemning the British action. It stated: "Since the British fleet attacked our country's fleet off Oran in North Africa, British Prime Minister Churchill gave a speech on July 14th of this year, declaring that he would no longer attack French warships. At the same time, our country's dismissed general, de Gaulle, also solemnly made a promise, declaring that he would never use the troops under his command to attack our country. Unexpectedly, the British, with the help of de Gaulle, are now everywhere attacking our country's colonies under the pretext of protecting them. As for the attack on our country's West African territory of Dakar, the inhabitants of that port are purely French and have not been threatened by any party. There is no need for Britain to overstep its bounds. The British are attempting to occupy Dakar, the key to the South Atlantic, purely for their own interests. In short, the British fleet first attacked our country's port of Oran and now invades the port of Dakar. They often mistreat our country's sailors who take refuge in Britain, which shows that the goal of this new act of aggression by Britain is to starve our people to death, bankrupt our country, and lead to the disintegration of our colonial empire. However, we have the determination to stop Britain's schemes. Our country's army, navy, and air force stationed in Africa have severely damaged and repelled the aggressors who attempted to land, and have taken various retaliatory measures. Our country's martyr, Joan of Arc, once said, 'Peace must be obtained on the bayonet.' How meaningful is this statement! At this time, the motherland hopes that the nation's naval officers and men will be loyal, courageous, and patriotic to defend our country's territories." (Havas Telegram, 20th)

### West African Port of Dakar: Important Strategic Position

LONDON: Dakar is located on the coast of West Africa, occupying a strategic position. It is a transportation hub with four airfields nearby. Dakar is also the starting point of the railway from the west coast to the Niger River in Central Africa. It also occupies an extremely important position in terms of telephone and telegraph communications. The German claim that Dakar is an undefended city is completely inaccurate, as can be seen from the fact that the port's coastal artillery has been constantly bombarding French and British ships. (Reuters Telegram, 25th)

### France Establishes Military Tribunal: To Try de Gaulle's Followers

VICHY: The cabinet held a state council meeting today and immediately passed the bill proposed by Justice Minister Alibert, which advocated the establishment of a military tribunal to try the followers of dismissed General de Gaulle and a bill on food speculators. Alibert also gave an explanation, stating, "Yesterday, when our country's West African territory of Dakar was attacked, dismissed General de Gaulle participated in the incident. Regardless of how de Gaulle explains it, the people of the country should have fully understood that what this person is striving for is to alienate our country's overseas territories and cause the successive collapse of mainland France and its colonies. If anyone still thinks that this is the best way to show patriotism, then that person must undoubtedly be crazy. At this time, the government knows that there are quite a few of de Gaulle's followers scattered throughout our country. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a military tribunal to try the rebels. In addition, those merchants who speculate on various grains are also extremely sinful and should also be transferred to this military tribunal for interrogation as a warning."

### German Foreign Ministry Releases: Outline of Rome Talks; Closely Study Operational Plans Against Britain; Discuss the Construction of a New European Order

BERLIN: A spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry told foreign reporters yesterday that the talks between Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano in Rome will become the most glorious historical event in modern history. According to the spokesman, who accompanied Foreign Minister Ribbentrop to Rome, he refused to announce the content and results of the Rome talks, only stating that the basic outline of the Rome talks is as follows:

The Rome talks discussed various issues to subdue Britain. The content of these issues is completely contrary to what has been repeatedly explored around the world. Its content is completely based on the basic concept of the Axis powers, that is, no compromise. What was discussed was the operational strategy against Britain on various fronts. Based on these two basic concepts, the Axis powers are engaged in their political, military, and diplomatic activities. All events in the battle against Britain, large and small, have been carefully considered. Therefore, today's talks among the Axis powers are not limited to combat. They are also responsible for discussing the current war situation and the construction of a new order. The characteristics of the new order are to help European countries survive equally on the European continent and work together for Europe to obtain the necessities of survival. Therefore, Britain is not only an enemy of Germany and Italy, but also an enemy of countries that are fighting for the principles of the new order and encountering British obstruction. Britain today has become an enemy of young and powerful countries. The extent to which each country holds this view is an important question. As for what kind of courage the supporters of Britain will have to resist the new order is an interesting question in theory, but it is of no political significance. The spokesman continued to discuss the current situation in Egypt, stating that the responsible leaders of Egypt know that although the fighting has entered Egyptian territory, it is not a war against the Egyptian people, but a war against Britain, which is exploiting Egypt. The new government of Egypt is a symbol that Egypt has already understood this principle. Regarding the tone of German newspapers towards Greece, it is the tone that the German-Italian alliance should adopt. (Haitong Telegram, 25th)

### Soviet Newspaper Comments on the Far East Situation: Great War Approaching the Pacific; Japanese Invasion of Vietnam Not Only Aimed at China; The Goal Is to Attack British, American, and Dutch Territories

MOSCOW: The Zhenli Bao published a commentary today entitled "Japan and Vietnam," stating, "Japanese newspapers claim that the Japanese invasion of Vietnam is only aimed at China. This kind of propaganda is nothing more than making people believe that Japan's plans at this stage have limited goals and do not strongly affect British and American interests. But in fact, Vietnam can not only be used as a base for operations against China, but also as a base camp for attacking the Dutch East Indies, the Philippines, and other British, American, and Dutch territories. American newspapers clearly stated that Vietnam is not Japan's main goal, as Japan's advance does not stop at Vietnam. Although Japan has not yet resolved the war against China, how can it invade Vietnam and incur economic retaliation from Britain and the United States? Therefore, the driving force behind the Japanese invasion of Vietnam is worthy of attention. We believe that the main reason for the Japanese invasion of Vietnam is due to the development of British and American cooperation. It is said that Britain is providing Singapore for American use. If so, then the scope of British and American cooperation has extended to the Pacific. In the war for supremacy in the Pacific, Japan must first expect resistance from the United States. Therefore, Japan has to consolidate its military position in future wars. In short, the Japanese invasion of Vietnam shows that the Pacific line of the Second Imperialist War is becoming active and the war is expanding." (Tass Telegram, 25th)

MOSCOW: The Red Star newspaper recently commented on the international situation, saying, "American Far East policy has become active and is enriching the actions of the American fleet. The work of dividing the French and Dutch legacies is underway, which has prompted the actions of the American fleet. The Japanese ruling class believes that Vietnam should immediately separate from France, and the Dutch East Indies should also separate from the Netherlands. Since the outbreak of the European War, Japan's southward advance and Japan's relations with Britain, the United States, Germany, and Italy have completely depended on the outcome of the Great War in England. This point is extremely clear. American observers believe that the British Navy can protect the Atlantic, and the United States can focus on strengthening its position in the Pacific. After the United States obtains Australia and Singapore, the balance of power in the Pacific will inevitably change again. American policy and British policy are gradually converging. Foreign observers believe that a military alliance between Britain and the United States may become a reality in a year. Therefore, the United States is preparing for war simultaneously in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans." (Tass Telegram, 25th)

### Japanese Ambassador Amah Visits Italian Foreign Minister: Discusses the International Situation

ROME: Japanese Ambassador to Italy Eiji Amau met with Italian Foreign Minister Ciano yesterday for forty minutes. According to reports, they discussed the general international situation, and attention was paid to Japan's invasion of Vietnam. At the same time, the authoritative Italian newspaper "Roma" published a commentary on the Japanese invasion of Vietnam, stating that Japan has now posed a great threat to Singapore. The newspaper further stated, "Japan has now occupied the entire northern Vietnam in accordance with the agreement signed between the Vichy government and Japan. This fact cannot be concealed by even pro-British propaganda. Japan's occupation of northern Vietnam has shattered the various conspiracies that the British government and the infamous French exiles have maintained to this day. The United States also expressed dissatisfaction with Japan's occupation of northern Vietnam, as Vietnam has the world's best-located harbors, which is enough to cause problems for the military strength of Singapore." (United Press Telegram, 25th)

TOKYO: Japanese newspapers today ridiculed the U.S. Secretary of State's condemnation yesterday of Japan's aggression against Vietnam. Hochi Shimbun said, "Blaming Japan is as boring as the joint defense of Singapore by Britain and the United States." The Tokyo "Nichinichi Shimbun" said that the United States, Britain, and Australia are now embarking on an "invasion front" to take action against the Dutch East Indies and other countries in the southwestern Pacific. The newspaper stated that the purpose of this "invasion front" is to prevent Japan's southward advance and believes that Britain and the United States are now advancing their Far East policy with new strength. It also stated that Australia showed "friendliness" to Japan and exchanged ambassadors in July, but Australia still refuses to export its wool products to Japan. Therefore, we firmly believe that Australia is on the same Far East front as Britain and the United States. (United Press Telegram, 25th)

### Japanese Vice Minister Submits Protest to British Ambassador: Opposes the Arrest of Japanese Residents

TOKYO: Semi-official Japanese sources say that Japanese Vice Minister Ohashi invited British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie to the Foreign Ministry to submit a protest to the British government, opposing the arrest of Japanese Consul-General Shinozaki and five other Japanese residents in Singapore on September 22, and the search of Shinozaki's office and the sealing of his safe deposit box. It is reported that Ohashi demanded an immediate improvement in the situation caused by the arrest of Japanese residents. According to the official report from the Japanese Consul-General in Singapore, he presented a strong protest to the Singapore Civil Affairs Department on September 22 against the British actions. The Civil Affairs Department explained that the search of Shinozaki's office was due to a misunderstanding, as it was mistakenly believed that the office was his private property. The seal on Shinozaki's safe deposit box has been removed as a result of the protest. (Reuters Telegram, 25th)

TOKYO: A spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry stated that the Japanese government attaches more importance to the case of the arrest of Japanese residents in Singapore than to the arrest of Japanese residents in other parts of the British Empire. When asked by reporters how the Singapore case differs from the espionage cases between Britain and Japan, which both governments call internal affairs, the spokesman replied that British police in Singapore entered the Japanese consulate office without the permission of the Japanese Consul-General, so this case is different in nature from other cases. (Reuters Telegram, 25th)

### British Air Force Bombing Italian Base

Cairo - The British Air Force communique released last night stated that on Sunday, British bombers attacked enemy aircraft parked at the Menastir airfield. All bombs landed within the target area.

### German Aircraft Drop Aerial Torpedoes, London Suffers Another Cruel Air Raid, Night Terror Causes Significant Damage, Bombed Area Reaches Over Forty Districts

Dublin - Last night, London suffered the most barbaric bombing in three weeks. German aircraft dropped hundreds of aerial torpedoes, sonic bombs, and incendiary bombs. A large bomb landed in central London, believed to be an aerial torpedo weighing at least one ton, destroying a central city building and killing several people. Several incendiary bombs ignited in the offices of a major American business, causing a fire. When firefighters attempted to extinguish the fire, water flowed into the air raid shelters, forcing the officials sheltering there to flee. One of the world's famous churches in northern London and a hospital were both hit and damaged. German aircraft flew overhead every minute during the night. It is feared that the number of casualties will be high. (Reuter's dispatch on the 15th)

London - Central London was again subjected to the most ferocious and cruel air raid last night. Nazi planes, laden with bombs, raged like a roaring tide over the British capital throughout the night, dropping no fewer than hundreds of bombs and incendiary devices. British anti-aircraft guns fired almost continuously, attempting to create a terrifying curtain of fire. Reports of damage continued to arrive until this morning. Although most of the German bombs fell on the outskirts, the attackers seemed to concentrate on attacking the central London area. According to initial reports, the bombed areas in London have reached over forty districts. The exact extent of the damage is difficult to ascertain immediately, but it is said that the areas where bombs rained down suffered the most severe damage. This morning, London residents emerging from basements and tunnels saw countless houses and shops with collapsed walls and fallen roofs. Piles of broken glass and rubble littered the streets, and workers are trying to clear them. Many streets were closed to traffic due to the delayed detonation of several German bombs. Last night, the sky was as bright as day due to the countless incendiary and illuminating bombs dropped by German aircraft. The aircraft used more illuminating bombs last night than usual, apparently to illuminate their targets. The large fires caused by the incendiary bombs were either extinguished or brought under control by sunrise this morning, preventing them from spreading. When the air raid first started, only the beams of searchlights were seen flashing in the clouds, and anti-aircraft guns fired at the points illuminated by the searchlights. However, sometimes the anti-aircraft guns fired fiercely into the sky without the assistance of searchlights. Last night, German planes first bombed the north, southeast, and southwest of London, and then dropped illuminating bombs with a yellowish glow in central London, followed by high-explosive bombs, causing terrifying explosions in central London. A government office building in western London was destroyed by a large bomb, and all the glass windows of all the buildings around the office were shattered. German planes then scattered their "Molotov bread baskets" over the commercial area of southwestern London, causing terrible damage. A large bomb hit an apartment and a famous restaurant in the western section, killing and injuring several people. Some people in the apartment who were in the study were killed, and those in the bathroom were injured. Only those living on the lowest floor of the building were spared. The upper two floors of the restaurant were destroyed. The diners on the lowest floor stopped eating, as the room was plunged into darkness after the building was bombed. In addition, dozens of other buildings, shops, and houses were destroyed, including two hospitals. It is reported that the casualties in the two hospitals were extremely heavy after being bombed. At least four places in western London suffered severe damage. German planes also dropped countless carbonized luminous bombs over central London, illuminating an area several miles wide. The German planes apparently flew at an altitude of 30,000 feet last night, hoping to evade the fierce anti-aircraft fire and the beams of countless searchlights. (United Press dispatch on the 25th)

London - Last night, at nearly 8 o'clock (4 o'clock this morning Shanghai time), when German planes appeared over London, launching the 122nd air raid since the start of the war on the British capital, anti-aircraft guns fired in unison, sounding like thunder. During the day yesterday, two large batches of German planes attempted to sneak into London but were repelled by British defenses. Air raid warnings were issued twice in London, but no enemy planes penetrated. Over 150 German planes in the first raid yesterday flew in close formation to the mouth of the Thames, where they were scattered by British artillery and fighter planes. It was reported that a German bomber crashed into the sea off Whitstable. Ten minutes later, a second batch of enemy planes arrived, where they were fiercely attacked by a large number of British Hurricane fighters, and immediately turned back and fled, fighting as they retreated. British planes pursued them fiercely to near Calais, and had already shot down one enemy plane. Although the fighter planes protecting these two batches of enemy planes were more numerous than before, they were all defeated. Several towns at the mouth of the Thames were hit by bombs, some of which fell in working-class areas. Before dusk yesterday, a Heinkel German plane attacked a town on the southeast coast and was about to fly back when it was engaged by British forces, leading to a fierce battle. Soon, three German planes were seen catching fire and crashing. (Reuter's dispatch on the 25th)

### British Planes Launch Another Distant Expedition, Fiercely Bombing the Outskirts of Berlin, German Channel Bases Continue to Be Attacked

Berlin - Last night, Berlin issued another air raid warning. British bombers again attempted to penetrate Berlin through intense anti-aircraft fire. However, as a result, the British planes were only able to bomb the outer areas. The air raid warning lasted for two hours and forty-eight minutes. It is reported that the British planes dropped many bombs during this period. According to official reports, several British planes attempted to penetrate Berlin, but were blocked by intense anti-aircraft fire, and most of the bombs dropped by the British planes landed in fields. Several civilian houses were bombed in the outer areas, and there were some casualties. A hospital was hit by an incendiary bomb, but there was no damage. The extent of other damage is still unknown. This British air raid was far less significant compared to the longest and most intense air raid since the start of the war last night. (United Press dispatch on the 25th)

London - An Air Ministry communique stated that British planes bombed the ports where the Nazis were preparing to invade Britain again last night. (Reuter's dispatch on the 25th)

London - The Air Ministry Information Office stated that the British Air Force bombed Berlin on Sunday night, with an average of one batch of British planes dropping bombs every four and a half minutes, continuing for several hours. This was the most intense attack on Berlin by British planes. Bombs were dropped on predetermined targets. Several bombers braved the harsh weather and circled over their targets for up to fifty minutes to accurately aim and drop their bombs. The targets attacked included the railways near the Postdammer and Rielde train stations, the West Suburb Power Station, and the Morbett and Klingenberg power stations, which were all hit and caught fire. According to one aircraft report, eight explosions were heard as railway sidings were bombed, and railway buildings subsequently caught fire. Large fires had broken out at the Klingenberg and other power stations, and British planes continued to drop large bombs, causing the fire to intensify. When the British planes flew back from the area, they flew low over the Schiphol airfield in Amsterdam, strafing its anti-aircraft lights. After the Morbett Power Station was bombed and five large fires broke out, the British planes that arrived later were able to identify the target by the firelight and dropped large bombs in continuous explosions. The flames were so intense that they could be seen from eighty miles away. Furthermore, the Charlottenburg and Wilmersdorf power stations were also bombed and caught fire. The gas plant on Danziger Strasse exploded violently after being hit, with flames shooting upwards, and the gas plants in Neukölln and Charlottenburg were also attacked and exploded, catching fire. Other targets hit included the Charlottenburg railway, the Spandau aircraft engine factory, the Tempelhof airfield, and the Siemens factory. According to a British aircraft that attacked the large gas plant in the northeastern part of Berlin and returned to base, the aircraft flew 1,200 miles round trip without encountering any obstacles. However, the British aircraft that flew later encountered strong resistance when approaching Berlin. After Berlin was heavily bombed, hundreds of fires broke out, and the sky was red. When Hamburg was attacked, a batch of large bombs hit the Blohm + Voss shipyard, and the entrance to the Kiel Canal was also hit by bombs and exploded. British planes attacked the port of Boulogne, bombing the inner harbor dock basin, causing a large fire. Twenty to thirty ships were berthed in the harbor, and one was hit, caught fire, and destroyed. British planes also flew to the port of Calais, dropping bombs that hit ships and the harbor basin.

German aircraft activity over Britain (Aerial Photography) (Haitong News Agency)

London - The Air Ministry Information Office announced that the British Air Force continued to bomb the French and Belgian coasts. The Brest naval base was attacked by British planes yesterday morning. Large bombs hit torpedo boat stations, oil tanks, and warehouses, causing loud explosions and fires everywhere. The port was shrouded in thick smoke, and the flames soared into the sky, visible from more than thirty miles off the French coast. British coastal aircraft also bombed the canal in Zeebrugge, dropping multiple batches of bombs, with intense flames after the explosions. (Reuter's dispatch on the 25th)

### German Military Communique

Berlin - According to the German High Command, German aircraft conducted armed reconnaissance in England, bombing military targets in London, destroying railways in the Dover area, harbors in Hastings and Brighton, and aircraft factories in Southampton. Air battles occurred frequently, and German aircraft were victorious. German aircraft sank a 3,000-ton merchant ship near the southeast coast of Ireland. Another merchant ship was hit and caught fire. A merchant ship was also hit at the entrance to a canal. A German torpedo boat sank a 2,000-ton armed merchant ship near the south coast of England. German aircraft launched a night raid on London. Harbors and military targets in Liverpool and Cardiff suffered heavy losses. British planes attacked Berlin from the north last night, but were unsuccessful due to intense anti-aircraft fire, only hitting a hospital and several houses. British aircraft lost twenty planes yesterday, eighteen of which were shot down in aerial combat, and two were shot down by anti-aircraft guns. Ten German aircraft are missing.

### British Planes Attack German Torpedo Boat Flotilla, Two Minesweepers Hit

London - Yesterday afternoon, five German motor torpedo boats patrolled outside Cape Gris-Nez in France. Six British planes bombed them. The German boats were sailing in a line a few miles off the French coast, clearly visible from the coast of Kent in England. A German seaplane was circling above them, but six British Air Force bombers suddenly emerged from the clouds high above, diving to bomb. Water sprayed up to a hundred feet beside the boats, making it impossible to see the bombing situation. As the British bombers ascended to prepare for another attack, Spitfire fighters soared in the air to protect them. No direct hits were seen on the German boats. They all turned around and sped towards the coast. However, according to one eyewitness, after the spray and smoke from two British plane attacks cleared, all the German boats had disappeared. It is suspected that some had sunk. (Reuter's dispatch on the 25th)

London - The Air Ministry released a communique last night stating that yesterday afternoon, a squadron of British bombers, escorted by fighters, attacked enemy minesweepers in the English Channel. Two ships were hit, and another was damaged by bombs exploding near the ship. At that time, enemy fighters arrived to counterattack. One British bomber was shot down, and one enemy plane was also destroyed. (Reuter's dispatch on the 25th)

### Second Year of the War, British Shipping, Mr. Cross Explains the Situation, Hopes the Public Will Save on Shopping

London - Shipping Minister Cross released an article last night, describing the situation at the beginning of the second year of the war, stating that the number of ships controlled by Britain today is greater than before the war. However, as the war continues, the demand for ships is increasing. Germany now controls only two-thirds of its pre-war tonnage, and its routes are limited to the Baltic Sea and certain parts of the European coastline. Italy's situation is the same as Germany's, controlling only three-quarters of its pre-war tonnage. Britain is different. Although British ships have been attacked by submarines, planes, raiders, motor torpedo boats, and mines, they are still operating continuously in the ocean. Eight percent of British merchant ships have been lost due to enemy action. However, the ships captured by Britain, the newly built ships, and the ships transferred from foreign countries not only make up for the losses, but there is also a surplus. However, the shipping situation is not the same as before the war, because the raw materials that used to be transported from Europe now have to be purchased from faraway places, and the ships that originally traveled through the Mediterranean Sea now have to travel around the Cape of Good Hope. In addition, many ships have been converted into armed cruisers, and many ships are dedicated to transporting the raw materials needed to manufacture military supplies, so that the tonnage of ships available for ordinary cargo is greatly reduced. However, Britain still has enough ships to meet all the major needs of imports and exports. It is hoped that the public will save on the purchase of non-essential goods, because Britain's current imports are between four and five million tons per month, while in peacetime they were one million tons.

### European War Miscellany (10) (3) Hitler's Private Life Snippets

Hitler expressed his contempt for foreign governments that "indulged" newspapers with freedom of expression. I heard him say, "These governments are simply spineless. Newspapers should speak according to the will of the government, not dictate to the government. Keeping a free newspaper is like tolerating an ulcer. Newspapers with freedom of speech are like ulcers, truly disgusting things in the country."

After dictating official documents, he would talk with political and military advisors. He could not tolerate even a word of criticism from others. Only Göring could be considered the most daring person in all of Germany to speak to him frankly. However, even he did so with great caution.

After dinner, Hitler often engaged in long night talks with friends until dawn. He had several lifelong attendants who were skilled pianists. When he felt mentally exhausted, he would ask one of them to play a piece of music for relaxation. He loved Wagner's music and the passionate performances of several German and Austrian musicians. He hated "jazz" dance music and often called English and American music "black people's乱弹 [luàn tán - rambling; nonsensical talk/music]". If he went to bed very late but couldn't fall asleep, he would get out of bed and return to his study, and wake up a guest to talk to him. When Goebbels lived in his villa, this "good" errand was always his responsibility. He would be dragged out of bed to listen respectfully to his leader's propaganda plans drafted in a few hours. Goebbels always sat there until dawn. At night, the kitchen was constantly staffed to be ready for coffee and snacks at any time.

If Hitler wanted to read or talk in the quiet of the night, he would often take his giant black car for a night drive. I often saw his car drive out of the garage in the middle of the night and speed away. He was too timid to drive himself. But he liked driving fast. His driver told me that the speed during night drives was always above sixty miles per hour, sometimes reaching one hundred miles per hour.

Hitler took extreme precautions against his enemies' petty calculations. He was most afraid of being poisoned in his food. Several hours before he ate, he had a chemical analyst thoroughly test all food samples. Hitler was not reassured by simply tasting for poisonous substances, because he was afraid that someone would use chronic poisoning as a hidden weapon against him. After the food had been tested by the chemist, only four chefs were allowed to touch it.

His treatment of the servants in his residence was often unpredictable. Sometimes, when you stood in front of him, he seemed not to notice you at all, which was truly uncomfortable. At other times, he would fly into a rage over the most trivial matters, such as tidying up his room or pouring too much coffee.

His strange temperaments were numerous. Often, over some very trivial matter that he thought disturbed him, he would cry like a madman. He would tell the person who offended him that they were deliberately disturbing him, preventing him from concentrating on the great task of saving Germany. If that person did not immediately beg for his forgiveness, they were sure to be sent to a concentration camp for training. However, sometimes he was extraordinarily gentle. He told the servants that everyone was a partner in the work, and that the responsibilities borne by his chefs were no less than those of his officers. His attitude was often like this after he had done a "tricky thing."

Although Hitler did not like women with heavy makeup or deliberately flirtatious behavior, he was just like ordinary people, fond of pretty faces and slender figures. He always invited five or six beautiful women to accompany him at his banquets. Guests at his banquets were not very happy, because smoking and drinking were restricted, and Hitler only liked one kind of music. However, who would dare to decline an invitation?

Servants often enjoyed watching guests sneak into other rooms to smoke and drink when Hitler wasn't paying attention. Usually, they sneaked into the room of the SS commander to find other joys. If they were unlucky and one of the sneaking guests was noticed by Hitler, a servant would have to call him back to listen respectfully to the reprimand for "leaving without permission."

Hitler was a person who couldn't stand laughter, especially jokes that satirized politics or were sarcastically abusive. Therefore, guests had little conversation or joy at the banquet table, but simply listened to the leader speak, like at a political conference.

Hitler's Triumphant Grand Occasion (Chronicle see previous Japan column)

When being a guest in Hitler's villa, you need to abide by the rules stipulated in the "Guest Notice." These regulations were printed on a single sheet of paper placed under the dressing table mirror in the guest's bedroom. I secretly took one out when I left Berchtesgaden, which reads:

1.  Smoking is prohibited in all areas except this bedroom.

2.  Guests should not converse with servants or ask them to deliver any packages or letters.

3.  In conversations or audiences, the title "Führer" must be used; do not use "Mr. Hitler" or other titles.

4.  Female guests should not wear heavy makeup, and nail polish is prohibited.

5.  When dining, please gather in the dining hall within two minutes after hearing the bell. Guests should not take their seats or leave until the Führer is seated or has retired.

6.  Guests should stand up immediately when the leader enters the room.

7.  Unless notified by the Führer, guests must rest by 11:00 PM every night.

8.  Guests must stay in the guest area. Entry to private rooms, offices, or political police stations is prohibited.

9.  When leaving Berchtesgaden, guests must not tell outsiders about their visit. The Führer's conversations must be kept strictly confidential. Those who disclose the Führer's private life will be severely punished.

Hitler's health had long been poor, although he never mentioned it to close confidants. Only a few people in the world knew about this, such as the famous German heart and throat specialist Professor Sauerbruch, who had performed three operations for Hitler; Professor Morell, a famous Berlin doctor and Hitler's lifelong personal physician; Professor Henri Steinmetz; and several other experts from Paris or New York. They could all keep Hitler's secrets.

There was a time when Hitler's heart troubled him greatly. When state affairs piled up waiting to be handled, he had to rest for a few days and do nothing. He suffered from heart fatigue syndrome. What worried Professor Morell the most was getting him to rest when he wouldn't obey, so he had to inject him with medicine from time to time.

Hitler's dentist, Berlin expert Hardenstein, found it very painful to treat his teeth. He would shout like a child at the slightest injury during tooth extraction. However, he still refused to use gas, fearing anesthetics. He only accepted them as an exception in cases of serious surgery. He had eight dentures and several gold inlays in his mouth.

To protect himself, Hitler hired two doubles. Their names could only be called out by the secret police who employed them. In private rooms, their true faces could still be recognized, but once they put on Hitler's clothes and were made up by experts, it was impossible to distinguish them from twenty yards away.

Four female servants rotated weekly to clean Hitler's bedroom. However, the male servant Freese was always present to supervise. The bedroom was simply decorated, with a large iron bed, a small half-table, a large table by the window, a sofa, a writing desk, and a bookcase. There was a small dressing room next door.

The bed was covered with a large brown bedsheet embroidered with a large swastika. Hitler's pajamas were the most beautiful and attractive of all his clothes. They were made of brown satin, with dark brown cuffs and lapels. The pocket had a red and black swastika. There was also a thick silk shirt in the same color. On the table beside the bed, there were often pencils and writing paper. Used pieces of paper were torn up every morning by Hitler or Freese. One day, when I was cleaning the room, I saw a crumpled piece of paper next to the wastepaper basket on the floor. I took the opportunity to stuff it into my pocket when Freese wasn't paying attention. Driven by curiosity, I wanted to see what Hitler wrote on the paper during sleepless nights.

I didn't take it out to look at until I returned to my own bedroom. The paper was covered with what looked like a rough map of some area. It was very scrawled and meaningless, with a few words of some sort. I couldn't figure out what it was about at all, so I put it in a drawer as a souvenir.

Two days later, it happened to be the day of the monthly report to the police station. Everyone working in Berchtesgaden had to go to the police station on the designated day each month to answer questions. If Hitler had any complaints about the servants, no matter how trivial, they would be fined or confined to the house for a month.

Because I believed I had done nothing wrong, I felt very honest in my heart when I stood before the police officer. He carefully read every item on the report and then said happily, "Miss, your report is very good."

I smiled and thanked him, and then he said gently, "Do you feel like there's anything you haven't gotten off your chest? Or anything that the Chamberlain [Shèlì Péng - transliteration of a foreign name/title] didn't notice?"

I looked at him in a daze. But I really couldn't think of anything, so I told him what I thought. Then he suddenly asked me:

"Miss, where is the piece of paper you took from the Führer's bedroom?"

This was a trap they had set. The piece of paper was deliberately placed on the floor. I argued that I thought it was waste paper that was about to be destroyed. I knew myself that this argument was unsustainable. The police officer told me to go back and wait in my room for further instructions. I sat alone in the room in great fear.

In the evening, the Chamberlain sent someone to call me to receive instructions. I was very lucky to only be fined three months' salary and confined to the house for one month. This was because I had always been without fault and had a very good record. Besides, I think it was because I usually had good relationships with the Chamberlain and the deputy housekeeper Elsa. Of course, I received a scolding, and if I committed another offense in the future, I would definitely be sent to a concentration camp. (The End)

### Traffic in the French Concession Also Paralyzed; Trams Still Operating; Trolleybuses and Buses All Stopped; Workers Present Conditions, Negotiations Today

Since all workers of the British-owned Shanghai Electric Tramways Company in the Public Concession went on strike on the 20th, the workers of the British-owned China Motor Bus Company, because the company had delayed in responding to the proposed labor-management reciprocity agreement, followed the tram workers and went on strike the day before yesterday (the 24th), causing the complete paralysis of public transportation in the concession. Unexpectedly, amidst the two strikes in the Public Concession, the buses and trolleybuses of the French Concession went on strike yesterday morning due to demands for improved treatment. Although the authorities of the two concessions and relevant people from all walks of life all want to mediate, there are still many key issues, and I am afraid they cannot be resolved with a few words. The details obtained from all parties yesterday are recorded separately below.

### The Strike Situation in the French Concession

According to reporters' investigations, after the workers of the buses and trolleybuses in the French Concession went on strike yesterday morning, they immediately convened a general meeting at noon. In addition to passing sixteen conditions to be presented to the management, they also elected officials. As for the representatives to negotiate with the company, they can also be introduced today and will begin negotiations with the management on the same day. According to a worker, the reason for the strike, in addition to the workers' demands that the company authorities improve treatment due to the increase in the level of living, is also because workers and the general management often have conflicts due to job relations, resulting in repeated punishments.

Trams Operate as Usual

The French Concession has bus routes only on two lines: Route 21 from Dapu Bridge to the Bund, and Route 22 from Xujiahui to the Bund. Trolleybuses only have Route 17 from Xieqiao to the Great World, and Routes 18 from Dapu Bridge to the Great World. All of these routes were suspended yesterday morning. Although trams are still operating as usual, the number of vehicles has been reduced, and the routes have also been greatly shortened. The French Concession has a total of 40 trolleybuses, 60 trams, and 63 buses, and each vehicle has two or three Vietnamese police officers stationed on board to monitor and protect it to prevent accidents.

Hand Grenade Fired in Xujiahui

Since all buses and trolleybuses were suspended yesterday morning, trams were also drawn into the whirlpool. Later, with the efforts of the French authorities and the police, the tram lines were able to resume operation at 9:00-10:00 AM, barely maintaining a line of transportation in the French Concession. However, the number of vehicles and the routes were shortened and reduced. Three vehicles on Route 1, five vehicles on Route 2, six vehicles on Route 7, and two vehicles on Route 10. At about 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon, when a Route 2 vehicle was driving to Xujiahui, there was a sudden loud noise, and a hand grenade exploded on the roadside, fortunately without injuring anyone. As a result, vehicles running to Xujiahui turned around at Route Ferguson [Fú Kāisēn - transliteration], and Route 10 vehicles only drove to the Lu Ban Road intersection and turned around, without driving straight to Zhaojiawan [Zhào Jiāwān - place name].

Strict Precautions Near Factories

After learning of the strike of the bus and trolleybus workers yesterday, the French Concession Municipal Council Police Department and the police sent many Vietnamese police officers and police personnel to Lu Ban Road, the intersection of Route Conti [Kāng Dì - transliteration], the bus factory around the bus factory and the intersection of Lu Ban Road and Xujiahui Road, and the vicinity of the Works Bureau to maintain strict precautions. French police gun trucks also went out in full force, patrolling back and forth on major roads.

Thirty-odd Workers Arrested for Holding Meeting

It was heard that at 11:00 AM yesterday, near the French Electric Tramways Company on Route Conti, more than 30 workers from the tram company's ticket sales, drivers, and machine room, coppersmith room, etc. attempted to gather near the company for a meeting. The police learned of this and sent a large number of patrol officers to arrest the workers holding the meeting. They are currently being investigated by the political department.

Strike Causes Reported by Western Newspapers

The English-language *Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury* reported that Chinese workers of the French Electric Tramways Company announced a general strike this morning (25th), causing the French Concession trams and buses operated by the company to fail to run, and the public transportation of the two concessions came to a complete halt. The strike of the French Electric Tramways Company only closely followed the strikes of the tram and bus companies in the Public Concession.

A Few Trams Still Maintained

Although the French Electric Tramways Company encountered a strike, it still sent a few trams this morning to maintain the main line business of Route Museum and Route Avenue Joffre, with one vehicle passing every ten minutes, driven by senior Chinese and Western ticket inspectors from the tram company. Each vehicle had an armed patrol officer to protect it to prevent disruptions by strikers. The general public is now concerned that the strike of the tram workers in the French Concession may spread to factories and large shops.

Large Number of Chinese People Demonstrate

Mr. Pfeiffer, manager of the French Electric Tramways Company, said this morning that two or three hundred strangers were carrying out a demonstration outside the Lu Ban Road depot, and posted strike slogans, which were dispersed by patrol officers. At the same time, 5,000 workers from the British Electric Tramways and Bus Companies are still in a state of stalemate today, as no labor-management consultations have been heard. It is also heard that the Yijun [义军 - volunteer troops/militia] are not ignoring the British ownership and have agreed to provide full assistance to the police in the event of an incident. It is also heard that the volunteer soldiers helped the patrol officers intercept the striking workers from the depot yesterday (24th), and today they are constantly exploring the situation in the depot.

### No Contact from Buses Yesterday

The workers of the British-owned Bus Company in the Public Concession, due to demands for improved treatment, broke down negotiations with the company authorities on the 23rd, and declared a strike the day before yesterday (24th). The labor side has held a meeting to decide to prepare four preconditions to be presented to the company authorities for acceptance, so that work can be resumed first, and then the 23 articles can be resolved. Only yesterday, the labor side believed that these preconditions might need to be partially revised, so yesterday they did not submit them to the company authorities in writing or verbally. There was also no contact between the labor and management sides. As for when negotiations will begin, or when a third party will mediate, reporters have inquired from all sides, but there is no definite news.

Threats to Life Forced This Action

According to a person in charge of the labor side, who told reporters, "This strike has caused anxiety and inconvenience to all sectors of society, and we express our deep regret. However, the company cannot consistently use perfunctory means to deal with the reasonable demands put forward by the workers. The workers, forced by the threat to life, struggling on the starvation line, have no choice but to take this action to urge the company to wake up. We will never take any drastic actions that damage the company's property or harm social security. All workers hold a calm and persevering attitude, waiting for the company's awakening, so as to accommodate reasonable demands. What we are striving for with all our strength is to obtain a reliable guarantee for our livelihood so that we can work with peace of mind in an environment of warmth and fullness." Yesterday, the police also sent a large number of detectives to Kang Nao Late Road to maintain preparedness around the company. There were no unexpected events throughout the day, and everything was in normal order.

### Promote the Cold Clothing Allowance; Appeal for Enthusiastic Response; Regardless of Gender, Age, or Strength; All Should Enthusiastically Support and Gather Strength

The Municipal Savings Movement Committee previously issued a message appealing to compatriots from all walks of life to enthusiastically promote the Cold Clothing Allowance Movement. Now, as the climate turns cold, the soldiers on the front line urgently need cold clothing to keep out the cold, so it is specially requested that all circles give full play to their conscience and enthusiastically donate to fulfill their national duty. The original text is recorded as follows: Dear compatriots of the city, the National Cold Clothing Movement Committee initiated and led local branches and charitable organizations to raise three million pieces of cold clothing. All sectors of the city have started cold clothing allowances due to transportation difficulties. Now that the weather is getting colder day by day, we think of millions of soldiers, and at the same time, we think of

Displaced and Wandering

Tens of millions of suffering compatriots in the gullies, we people in the rear are really obliged to raise cold clothing. Especially the people living in this Shanghai Concession, they should take special responsibility. Try to see which area in the country can be as safe as Shanghai, and which people can enjoy what the people of Shanghai enjoy. We are all descendants of Yan and Huang, why should we only care about personal safety and enjoyment? If the citizens of Shanghai still only care about selfishness and self-interest, and do not use enthusiasm to promote the cold clothing

Raising Cold Clothing

Allowance movement, which accounts for the first place in the country, how can we be worthy of the country, how can we be worthy of the nation, how can we be worthy of the soldiers and suffering compatriots? If the citizens of Shanghai can do their best to solicit applications for this cold clothing allowance movement, regardless of their strength, regardless of gender or age, at least they can reduce some

Conscience Condemnation

Slightly fulfill the national duty. I hope that all sectors of Shanghai, whether agriculture, industry, commerce, or academia, should automatically promote and actively solicit applications, and contribute to the government in terms of material resources, financial resources, and manpower.

### Tram Strike Labor and Management Stalemate

The tram strike in the Public Concession, which has reached six days, is in a stalemate due to the failure of the labor and management sides to approach the conditions for resuming work. Yesterday, the workers did not send representatives to the company to negotiate. The labor side still insists that the management must first accept the four preconditions before agreeing to resume work, but the management has not shown any signs of compromise as of yesterday. Therefore, the stalemate between the two sides is not easy to break for a while. According to another news, the Industrial Section of the Public Concession Public Works Department will assume the responsibility of mediation after understanding the situation of the labor and management sides.

### Overseas Chinese Compatriots Enrolled Actively: Aviation Donations: Pledged Hundreds of Thousands of US Dollars

Since the Overseas Department of the Overseas Chinese Aviation Salvation Movement Committee sent personnel to Central and South America, Canada, Honolulu, the Philippines, and other places to launch aviation salvation donation fundraising, and the committee's chief member, Mr. Chen Qingyun, went to fluoresce actively, the enrollment situation of overseas Chinese compatriots in various places is extremely enthusiastic. It is now known that the results of the promotion in the United States, the San Francisco side is responsible for raising one million US dollars through the Unified Donation Federation, and Consul General Feng is responsible for raising 500,000 US dollars. Other cities in Western America, such as Los Angeles, pledged 150,000 US dollars, and Stockton, Sacramento, and Phoenix pledged 100,000 US dollars each. Although the number of overseas Chinese in other cities in Western America is not large, they also pledged to raise 20,000 to 30,000 US dollars each. It is expected that the future results will be very impressive. The patriotic enthusiasm of overseas Chinese compatriots can be seen from this, which is very admirable.

### Cigarette Prices Increase

Huawen News Agency reports that commodity prices have skyrocketed in the past two years, and the market prices of various cigarettes have also increased accordingly. It is now known that the unified tax on various exhaust emissions has doubled according to the previous tax rate, which was implemented yesterday (fourteenth), so the retail prices of various cigarettes on the market have generally risen sharply recently.

### Heard Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday: Such as Holding Important Meeting: Discussing the Transfer of Area B by the US Military

Admiral Heard, Commander of the US Asiatic Fleet, set off from Qingdao on the afternoon of the 23rd of this month and sailed to Shanghai on his flagship *Augusta* yesterday. Mr. Heard went ashore and went straight to the US Naval Office on Jiangxi Road to rest. The reporters of the Pingming News Agency inquired from the US naval relations that Mr. Heard intends to convene a military and political meeting there that night, which has a major relationship with the transfer of "Area B". According to foreign sources, Mr. Heard will still adhere to his previous position after returning to port yesterday, and strongly advocate that the defense of Area B should be taken over by the US 4th Marine Regiment, and reconcile the opinions held by Secretary of State Hull. Therefore, during his stay in Shanghai, the problem of the defense zone, which has been delayed for more than a month, must be solved. As for when he will leave Shanghai, it has not yet been determined, but it is believed that he will stay in Shanghai for three or six weeks before going to the Philippines for the winter.

### Shanghai Municipal Council: Rewards Police Officers for Outstanding Performance

On the morning of July 6th this year, Li Shufa, a Chinese deputy inspector of the Public Concession Police Department, led a group of Chinese detectives in plainclothes on patrol in Zhaofeng Park. He noticed three Chinese men loitering suspiciously near the Jisi Garden on the road. A few minutes later, he saw these men approach the back gate of the park. The detective and others went out of the park gate at that time. At this time, these men were stopping a rickshaw to search the passengers, the detective immediately ordered them to raise their hands. One of them had a handgun and resisted by refusing to obey. Thereupon, the detective opened fire, resulting in the arrest of all three bandits and the confiscation of a handgun. One of the bandits later died from his injuries.

Also, at about 12:00 noon on July 24th, Chinese constable No. 2482, Zhang Ruisheng, was on duty near the Yinghua Lane entrance on Labaisen Road (Avenue Dubail) near Hede Road. Two bandits (one unarmed, one armed) suddenly grabbed his arm from behind and robbed him of his pistol. Afterward, they fled west along Labaisen Road. The constable immediately gave chase while blowing his whistle. As a result, the constable caught up with one bandit on Labaisen Road near Wanfeng Lane and knocked him down with a baton. He recovered the lost pistol and fired three shots, wounding the bandit. The Police Department's Awards Committee considered the officers' bravery and resourcefulness to be commendable and, after submitting it to the Bureau, awarded each of them a second-class medal to encourage them.

### Commonalities Between Confucianism and Buddhism (1)

— Yang Zhongyi

Confucianism calls them sages, Buddhism calls them Buddhas; Confucianism calls them worthies, Buddhism calls them Bodhisattvas; their names are different, their meanings are the same. Confucianism has the distinction between lesser and greater Confucians; Buddhism has the distinction between Hinayana and Mahayana. Hinayana refers to the *Shravakas* and *Pratyekabuddhas*, also called, those who carry ordinary people. Mahayana, then, is the basis from which all past, present, and future Buddhas receive blessings. The one and only doctrine that is common to all in the ten directions and unchanging in the three ages is that they all rely on correct practice to understand falsity and attain truth, to transform delusion into enlightenment, to proceed from cause to effect, to transcend the mundane and enter the sacred, and to reach the state of Great Enlightenment, the Tathagata. What the two vehicles of *Shravakas* and *Pratyekabuddhas* cultivate are the Four Noble Truths and the Twelve Links of Dependent Origination. The path of the Mahayana Bodhisattva, then, is the Six *Paramitas*. In Sanskrit, *paramita*. Classics often shorten it to *parami*. In Chinese, Kumarajiva's old translation is "crossing over," and Xuanzang's new translation in the Tang Dynasty is "arriving at the other shore." It actually contains two meanings, referring to the great practice of the Bodhisattva, which ultimately involves the affairs of benefiting oneself and benefiting others. When these affairs are ultimately carried out, relying on this great practice, one can leave this shore of life and death and reach the other shore of Nirvana, called arriving at the other shore. Because this great practice can cross over the vast expanse of all phenomena, it is called limitless crossing over. There are six kinds of *paramitas*: first, *dana*; second, *sila*; third, *ksanti*; fourth, *virya*; fifth, *dhyana*; and sixth, *prajna*. Therefore, they are called the Six *Paramitas*.

The First is Called *Dana Paramita*

*Dana* in Chinese means generosity. It means giving benefits to others without being stingy or jealous; that is, charitable undertakings and great compassion that benefit sentient beings, and can save others from suffering, is called compassion. The Buddha Bodhisattva's compassion is vast, so it is called great compassion. Briefly speaking, there are four types:

First, Material Giving

The *Mahaprajnaparamita Sutra* translated by Kumarajiva states: "Good thoughts corresponding to a giving heart are called *dana*. There are three types of *dana*: maintaining precepts and self-restraint, and not infringing on the property of all sentient beings, which is practicing material giving." The *Dharma Garden Theory* states: "There are five types of material giving: first, giving wholeheartedly; second, giving with faith; third, giving at the right time; fourth, giving with one's own hands; fifth, giving according to the law. There are also five things that should not be given: first, wealth obtained through unreasonable means should not be given to others, because the object is impure; second, alcohol and poisonous substances should not be given to others, because they confuse sentient beings; third, traps and nets should not be given to others, because they trouble sentient beings; fourth, music and female beauty should not be given to others, because they corrupt the pure mind." The *Upasaka Precept Sutra* translated by Dharmaraksa of Northern Liang states: "Those without wealth say that they have no wealth; this meaning is not so. Why? Everyone has all water and grass. Even a king does not necessarily give, even the poor are not unable to give.

Therefore, there are no people who cannot give, but there are things that cannot be given. Wealth that is not just is not originally ours. How can we give it to others? As for food that harms health, instruments that injure life, conduct that disturbs peace, and objects that corrupt virtue, all are in the category of prohibited giving. The measure of great compassion is as thorough as this.

Mencius said: "The heart of compassion is the beginning of benevolence." Is the Buddha's giving the same as Confucius and Mencius' benevolence? Benevolence is the meaning of people interacting with each other; that is, being able to treat mankind and exhaust the relationship and assistance between each other is what is called benevolence. Therefore, the *Analects* states: "The benevolent man, wishing to establish himself, also establishes others; wishing to enlarge himself, he also enlarges others. To be able to take near at hand analogies may be called the method of benevolence."

Second, Effort Giving

The *Upasaka Precept Sutra* also states: "Among the people in the world, who is so poor that they have no body? If they have a body, seeing others doing good deeds, their body should go to help, which is also called a benefactor, and also obtains blessings."

Therefore, this is because human power is insufficient. What my power can do is to help each other, so it is called giving of effort; that is, those who have wealth give wealth, and those who have effort give effort. The giving is the same. Perfecting the beauty of adults and helping the world is the effort giving of Confucianism! In the past, the father of Confucius, Shu Lianghe, broke open the gate of Biyang City and saved the teacher who was trapped. It is one example of effort giving.

Third, Dharma Giving

The *Mahaprajnaparamita Sutra* also states: "Being able to preach the Dharma in various ways, causing them to hear and understand, is called Dharma giving." The *Adbhutadharma Sutra*, also called the Sutra of Unprecedented Dharma or Wonderful Dharma, is one of the Twelve Divisions of Scripture. It is quite capable of summarizing the essentials of both material and Dharma giving, saying, "Giving food and drink saves a life for a day. Giving treasures and wealth saves a generation from poverty, increasing bondage. Explaining the Dharma and teaching and transforming is called Dharma giving, which can lead all sentient beings to transcendent wisdom." The *Mahapurisalaksana Sastra* by Devapala Bodhisattva, translated by Dao Ti of Northern Liang, is truly capable of distinguishing the flavor of both material and Dharma giving, saying, "Material giving removes the physical suffering of sentient beings, creating endless money and wealth for them, so that they may obtain physical pleasure, be loved by sentient beings, and be loved by foolish people, giving present happiness. Dharma giving removes the mental suffering of sentient beings, creating endless wisdom for them, so that they may obtain mental pleasure, be respected by the world, and be loved by wise people, giving the happiness of Nirvana."

Therefore, Dharma giving is most valued by both Confucianism and Buddhism. As the saying goes, "Persuade with your mouth for one generation, persuade with books for a hundred generations." Writing and establishing words is the Dharma giving of Confucianism! The Five Teachings and Three Periods of the Tathagata, speaking the Dharma according to conditions, are the same as Confucius's teaching according to aptitude, and educating without discrimination, and Mencius's joy in nurturing talent, cultivating virtue, and achieving talent. Confucius's kind and skillful guidance of people, learning without weariness and teaching without discouragement, teaching without weariness is benevolence. Therefore, teaching without weariness is Confucius's Dharma giving. Distinguishing between kingly and hegemonic ways, and speaking of benevolence and righteousness, is Mencius's Dharma giving.

Fourth, Fearlessness Giving

The *Mahaprajnaparamita Sutra* also states: "Sentient beings fear death, relying on precepts and not harming, which is called fearless giving."

Therefore, "If I hear the Dao in the morning, I can die content in the evening." It is like this that the Dao cannot be heard. If one's faith in the Dao is not strong, and one knows that one cannot achieve it, one bears this body in vain, as if one had not heard it. Therefore, the power of great vows must be pursued with a fearless spirit. Confucius's "not yielding to benevolence" and Mencius's "Do I like disputing?" are the fearless giving of Confucius and Mencius. As for Confucius's saying, "kill oneself to achieve benevolence," and Mencius's saying, "sacrifice life to achieve righteousness," because their righteousness is exhausted, their benevolence is supreme. Wen Tianxiang said, "What have I learned from reading the books of sages and worthies? Great, earth-shattering, tearful, and songful deeds." Are they all the fearless giving of sages, worthies, and Bodhisattvas?

### Record of Robbery Cases

At 8:30 last night, three bandits broke into No. 674 on East Westward Road in Hongkou. One bandit produced a handgun and ordered no one to make a sound. 234 yuan in legal tender was robbed and the bandits fled without a trace.

### Rumor of Xu Jianping's Kidnapping: After Dinner at Lu Shaotang's Home, He Went Out; the Truth of Yu Garden Road Is Difficult to Ascertain

According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury," Xu Jianping, a major banker who once served as an important official in the Central Government, was kidnapped last night (the 24th) on Yu Garden Road after having dinner at his father-in-law Lu Shaotang's home. It is widely believed that Lu has been in contact with some party. Since this case occurred on an outer-road, the details are unknown. Xu was born in Shanghai on March 28, 1889, and has a high reputation among Chinese and foreigners. He served as editor of the *Dachen Bao* from 1917 to 1925 and participated in the Washington Conference as a special correspondent for the newspaper. In addition, Xu served as a Chinese director of the Shanghai Municipal Council for a long time and later entered the Central Government to assist Kong Xiangxi, serving as Director-General of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance and director of the Central Bank. The reason for his kidnapping is currently unknown.

Unable to Confirm

Officials of the Public Concession Police Department have been unable to confirm the news that Xu Jianping, a well-known figure in the banking world, was kidnapped on Yu Garden Road the night before last night or last night. According to a senior official of the Police Department, the police have conducted an investigation but have found no clues. Xu is a well-known person in Shanghai, currently 51 years old, and once served as editor of the *Continental Daily News* and attended the Washington Conference as a special correspondent for the newspaper. There, he met Kong Xiangxi, the current Minister of Finance of China. Later, he served as Director-General of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance and director of the Central Bank.

### Unseen Control of Exports of Foreign Cloth and Cotton Yarn; Inspection Gradually Tightening

The Japanese military has implemented control over local and foreign goods in the occupied areas of China, making purchase and sale inconvenient for merchants. This is also being gradually implemented in Shanghai. It has recently been heard that although the Japanese military has not formally implemented control over the export of foreign cloth and cotton yarn, they are paying close attention to it. Exports from the wharves of the Public Concession north of the Yangjingbang have been obstructed. If detained, they are instructed to obtain a permit from the Japanese Naval Accounting Office inside the Zhaoshang North Warehouse in the Tilanqiao area on Broadway before they can be transported out. When barges transport goods to export ships, they must also be detained by the Water Gendarmerie Team when passing the Water Restaurant on the Bund of Beijing Road. In the past, two barges were detained and only released after obtaining permits in accordance with the regulations. It is heard that the inspection work at the wharves of the Shanghai Municipal Council along the Huangpu River is carried out by the Gendarmerie Team on the fifth floor of the Yokohama Specie Bank. Inspection work has been very tense recently.

### National Factory Investigation Record

Xu Wancheng compiled the "Post-War Shanghai and National Factory Investigation Record," which is a detailed investigation. The names of managers, technicians, etc., are recorded, and the trademarks of each factory are engraved and printed. After publication, it was purchased by many business circles in Shanghai and abroad. The actual price per copy is 9 yuan. It is published and distributed by the Dragon Literature Store, No. 4, 3rd Floor, Yanye Building, Beijing Road. Telephone number 16435.

### Two Russians: Relying on Force, They Trampled on a Female Waitress; Prosecuted for the Crimes of Assault and Rape; After Trial, Each Was Sentenced to Imprisonment

A Russian named Lan Bing (age 30) had a meal with his fellow countryman, Kelmen, at a Russian restaurant on Avenue Joffre in the French Concession at about 12:00 a.m. on the 17th of this month. Later, they lured out a Russian waitress named Berland. They took a car to a remote area near Xihua Road on Xian Road in the Public Concession. Lan Bing forcibly held the woman's throat to prevent her from making a sound. His friend Kelmen then struck the woman on the head with an iron bar. Lan Bing tore off her small clothes and raped her. After a while, Kelmen pushed the woman out of the car, injuring her face and knees, and they fled. After the incident occurred, the Chinese and Western detectives of the Hongkou Police Department arrested the two Russians, Lan and Kelmen, one after another and sent them to the First Special District Court. The police lawyer Zhang Tianyin filed a public prosecution based on the two crimes of assault and rape, requesting severe punishment. After a deliberation, the verdict was pending. Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang Shuzi presided over the third criminal court and sentenced Lan Bing to five years' imprisonment and Kelmen to two years and six months, respectively, to serve as a warning.

### Another Important Criminal Was Apprehended in the Human Trafficking Organization; Arrested in Xiamen and Will Be Sent to Shanghai for Joint Trial

Xie Wanfang, a Chinese inspector of the Public Concession General Inspection Office, and Zhang Decai, a Chinese detective of the Jiaxing Road Police Station, and Ji Ronggui, a Chinese police chief, had previously cracked a large-scale human trafficking organization in Shanghai and Xiamen. They specialize in abducting boys in this city and the surrounding villages and then transport them to Xiamen, Shantou and other places for sale. Each child can fetch a price of about four hundred yuan. Over the years, no fewer than two hundred children have been abducted. This kind of pursuit of profit, but disregard for the pain of others, is truly worthy of hatred. After the organization was cracked, the detectives arrested 16 members of the party, including the leaders Su Desan and Chen Zhangshi, and recovered six abducted boys in Shanghai, all of whom have been identified by their families. Sixteen children were also recovered on Gulangyu, six of whom have been identified by their families. The police have taken photos of the remaining ten children and sent them to Shanghai to prepare for identification. Once they have been identified, they will be brought to Shanghai from Gulangyu. Now, the police have

Arrested in Xiamen

The main female criminal, Shi Jiaosao. She is currently being held by the local police station. It is expected that a large number of abducted children will be recovered. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xiefei of the First Special District Court opened the first criminal court to interrogate this case. The police lawyer Ru Baoyi stated that the police are currently planning to wipe out this gang in one fell swoop and prevent future troubles. Therefore, he requested that the hearing be adjourned. Judge Xiao then ordered the defendants to be detained for another hearing at a later date. As for those who have lost boys, they can go to the Jiaxing Road Police Station for identification.

### Da Chang Coal Company Refuses to Deliver Goods; Judgment Allows Provisional Execution

Yu Zuoting, Zhang Shouyong, Chen Shichang, and others, well-known figures in Shanghai's industrial circles, established the Sino-American Chemical Industrial Manufacturing Factory at the intersection of Changping Road and Jiaozhou Road, with a capital of one million yuan, specializing in the production of acid raw materials. Last June, they ordered 1,000 metric tons of coal dust from Da Chang Coal Company, established by Xu Guisheng and Yu Shunmao. They paid the price of 28 yuan per ton from September of last year to March of this year. After the order was placed, the price of coal in Shanghai suddenly soared to over 200 yuan per ton, resulting in a price difference of more than 200,000 yuan from the time of the order. Da Chang, using the excuse that the Sino-American factory was not completed, refused to deliver the goods. Sino-American then hired lawyers Chen Tingrui and Sun Zuji to file a lawsuit against Da Chang for delivery. Although Jin Tingsun and others mediated, it was to no avail. Da Chang was also defended by lawyers Jiang Yiping and others. The result of the trial was a judgment that Da Chang should deliver 1,000 metric tons of Kailuan coal dust to Sino-American, allowing for average fulfillment over seven months, with Da Chang bearing the litigation costs. Da Chang, dissatisfied with the judgment, appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court, which has also concluded the hearing. Yesterday, Presiding Judge Ye, along with Judges Luo and Pang, announced the judgment, rejecting the appeal. The portion of the initial trial judgment regarding the delivery of coal was allowed for provisional execution, with the appellant, Da Chang, bearing the litigation costs.

### Social Miscellany

Fan Shen, a Ningbo woman residing at 76 Li Mei Road in the French Concession, suddenly had a 7-carat diamond ring, a gold watch chain, and other gold jewelry, totaling over 33,000 yuan in value, stolen by her hired maid, Wu Wang (32 years old, from Yangzhou), in March of this year. The French police dispatched detectives to apprehend Wu Wang and transfer her to the Special No. 2 Court. Yesterday, Judge Zhu Chuzhe continued the trial in the Eighth Criminal Court. Part of the stolen goods had been returned. The defendant confessed to the theft without denial. The court then declared Wu Wang guilty of continuous theft and sentenced her to two years and six months of imprisonment.

### Letter

To Whom It May Concern: According to a statement from a representative of the Li Yuan Customs Brokerage, upon reading the news article "Younger Brother Plots to Kill Older Brother" in yesterday's newspaper, it was found to be slightly inconsistent with the facts. The Xin Yuan firm is only affiliated with our firm through a leasing relationship. Zhou Xiu Zheng, the victim, is the Xin Yuan firm's accountant and not an employee of our firm. The report stating that Mr. Zhou is the chief accountant of Xin Yuan and Li Yuan is clearly not factual. Especially fearing causing misunderstanding, we specifically request the representative to send a letter to your newspaper for correction. Sincerely, Attorney Huang Jiyuan, September 25th.

Feng Dingzhang is the Dean and Head of the Commerce Department, and Huang Jialu is the Head of the Economics Department. In addition, the university has established several Jiageng Professorships to commemorate Chen Jiageng's contribution to founding the university. In 1940, it was decided that Professors Xie Yuming, Fu Ying, Chen Ziying, Zhou Bianming, and Zhu Baoxun would serve as Jiageng Professors. In 1940, the university further hired eleven professors who have arrived at the university to teach. The university currently has twenty-eight school buildings covering thirty acres. The library has a newly built reading room that can accommodate 140 people. In addition to more than 8,000 Chinese books and more than 3,000 Western books, there are also books stored in Gulangyu. Currently, there are a total of 81,465 Chinese and Western books and magazines. The library regularly subscribes to 26 types of Chinese newspapers, 3 types of Western newspapers, and 272 types of Chinese and Western magazines.

It has now opened thirteen air-raid shelters, which can accommodate about 1,300 people. In addition to protecting the university's faculty, staff, and students, it can also accommodate dozens of nearby residents. The safety of the university's students is naturally not a concern. Second is life. The university's students are considered to be uniquely favored. At present, the cost of living in Changting is at least 60-70% lower than in Chongqing, Chengdu, Kunming, Guiyang, and other places. Not long ago, the university's food expenses were only 8 yuan per month, and recently increased to 12 yuan. Moreover, the university has various scholarships and loans, and students from poor families with excellent grades can simply not have to pay for themselves. In addition, due to the establishment of the Self-Help Committee, students can also request the committee to introduce work in a suitable way during their spare time after class to provide relief. The university's students wear uniforms, long gowns and suits all year round, which have long disappeared. The pure and simple style is commendable. Their dormitories are organized by grade, and the three colleges are integrated, so the students have truly achieved mutual love and sincerity, with no distinction between colleges and hometowns. Third is activity. The atmosphere of research in the school is very strong, which can be seen from the activities of various societies. Professors volunteer to give lectures outside of class, often several times a week. They can all enthusiastically engage in social services. They actively participate in every donation movement. In particular, the work of promoting people's schools has never been interrupted. All of this is enough to prove that Xiamen University is moving forward closely to develop inland culture.

### Charity Basketball Challenge Continues; Paramount Has Abandoned Its Prejudices; Order Must Be Rearranged and Published Later

The charity basketball challenge match, an unfortunate incident, after days of running and mediation by the organizers of the Rich Bureau, the settlement of Mr. Yuan Ludeng, and the solemn criticism of a few ignorant spectators by the world of theory, Paramount finally gave priority to the overall situation and abandoned the original proposal of not participating in the competition, so that the charity cause would not be interrupted by this. His spirit of great justice and selflessness is worthy of admiration. According to Mr. Gu Senkang, the backbone of Paramount, "I feel very sorry for the occurrence of this unfortunate incident. Paramount is not deliberately trying to make things difficult for the charity cause. Until the arrival of this kind of adversity, anyone will be discouraged. Think about the hard work of the players, running around, sweating and fighting, all based on the thought of charity, and the generosity of enthusiastic spectators, which is really the same goal by different routes. Therefore, the purpose of our team's participation in the competition is not to care about winning or losing, but to hope to do our best. In general, a slow offensive strategy does lack stimulating appreciation, but it is very practical during combat. Our team deeply feels that its skills are not yet proficient and its strategy is not high enough, which has not been understood by the audience. Only with the urging of Mr. Yuan, the encouragement of the theoretical community, and the enthusiasm of most charitable spectators, our team has to reluctantly make it difficult again to work with the Shanghai heroes. However, Feng Nianhua, a player from our association, suffered a serious injury to his waist in the battle against Shanghai Star, and Bao Songyuan's facial injury has not yet healed. Therefore, he may not be able to mobilize his troops to fight in two or three days," and so on. In this case, the challenge meeting can continue to be held, and a huge wave has come to an end. However, the battle schedule for the next four games must be re-arranged. Therefore, the third battle between Paramount and Liangxi is when we can catch up and hold it this Sunday, which must be discussed by the Competition Committee before it can be disclosed tomorrow.

### Speculation in Yarn and Cotton Yarn Intensifies Again; Exploiting Idle Funds for a Large-Scale Speculative Bubble; Rising Prices Are Difficult to Curb, Buying Higher and Higher

The yarn market is strengthening and the bubble is extremely fierce. This is due to the intense speculative buying trend. General non-industry players have been silent for a long time. In view of the slight increase in current sales and the stronger absorption and promotion, on the one hand, rumors that are beneficial to the multi-party are extremely prevalent. According to the market, the securities gang, the gold gang, and the small silver numbers are probably using the loose money supply to advance to the yarn market to make kick-the-ball transactions. Therefore, the upward force is very strong. However, a certain Feng agency throws out thousands of bales of Shuangma factory orders here during the day. However, a sudden rainstorm is difficult to curb, and it is bought higher and higher. As for the Hong Kong sales market, it has become stagnant.

The current yarn opened in the morning. Amidst the rumors and chaos, the 20-count Shuangma yarn was firm and strong. The first lot rose by more than ten yuan to 1,058 yuan. The lot immediately rose step by step. Although there were large sellers, the market was still advancing. It rose all the way to 1,090 yuan. However, the needs of guest gangs have turned stagnant after the high prices. However, the buying sentiment on the betel surface is still extremely enthusiastic. Although there were some profit-takings in the middle, the market price rose as soon as it returned. It was found that 3,845 bales were traded in half a day, and transactions within the same industry accounted for more than two-thirds. The price of 20-count Shuangma jumped 58 yuan. The amounts bought by each gang are listed as follows:

Same industry 3,010 Hong Kong 825 Ningbo 10 Statistics 3,845

On the 26th, 1,552 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.

### New Cotton Has Some Sources

The current cotton situation has also turned good. This is because the yarn market has risen, and people's hearts have been encouraged accordingly. However, the factory's Chinese merchants are more active in exploration, but the needs of foreign factories are still average. New cotton has some sources.

In other news, the price of foreign cotton, the New York cotton market, was very active in the early morning. Due to good spot transactions and purchases on Wall Street, the closing price rose 34 points compared to the previous day. Indian cotton rose by more than half a rupee yesterday, including forecasts.

The trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai yesterday also increased due to the rise in the price of cotton yarn and the lack of cotton inventory in the market. Therefore, the market was very brisk, especially for those with long fibers. However, 20-count raw cotton was also active because of this.

### Financial Foreign Exchange Long-Short Positions: Cautious Observation

Yesterday's foreign exchange market: HSBC's quoted rates remained stable. The unofficial market for British and American currencies was very stable, lacking excitement. Operators remained cautious and observed the market, resulting in weak buying and selling interest. In the morning, the British pound opened slightly stronger at 3/84.484375, while the US dollar remained unchanged at 5.3125 yuan. Subsequently, due to sales of British gold by Chinese banks, the British pound briefly returned to its opening level. However, around noon, HSBC unexpectedly showed buying interest, causing the British pound to weaken slightly to 0.15625. The US dollar saw mixed fortunes, with the exchange rate rising again to around 3.69 yuan. Trading was not quiet. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.

In the early morning, London's long and short-term large bills fell by 0.0625. New York silver prices remained stable, and the London gold price remained fixed.

Central Bank quoted rates for various currencies remained unchanged. Bank spot selling prices were 3/84.484375 for the British pound and 5.3125 yuan for the US dollar. Compared to the previous closing, the British pound was up by 0.015625, while the US dollar was stable. The market was quiet after opening, with little trading. After HSBC's quoted rates were announced, there was no change. The silver balancing tax was announced to have fallen by 0.25. Subsequently, Chinese banks suddenly sold spot British gold to British banks at 3/84.484375 and half that amount, causing the British pound to return to its opening level. Although some Chinese merchants subsequently bought in, Chinese banks and foreign banks were still willing to supply. At that time, the situation lacked change. Speculators bought US dollars for September delivery from foreign banks at 5.3125 yuan, and Chinese banks also sold US dollars for October delivery to foreign banks at 5.3125 yuan. As such, around noon, HSBC suddenly bought US dollars for October delivery from other banks at 5.3125 yuan. The market was stable with a slight weakening. At closing, the British pound remained at 3/84.484375 and the US dollar at 5.3125 yuan. The British pound for October delivery was 3/84.46875 and the US dollar was 5.28125 yuan.

### Gold Prices Remain Firm

The half-day market situation for spot gold fluctuated around the 6,200 yuan level, indicating a firm sentiment. Buying followed selling, and the market was quite active. Despite a slight weakening of the foreign exchange market after HSBC's buying around noon, selling pressure was relatively low, and the price actually rose by several yuan. The opening price was only 6,175 yuan, and after bullion dealers dumped gold, the price was pushed down by several yuan to a low of 6,170 yuan. Subsequently, bullion dealers suddenly reversed course and became buyers, and a certain gold firm frequently pushed up prices. Although spot dealers and some money exchange businesses continuously sold, the market trend finally strengthened. At closing, the price rose to 6,207 yuan, an increase of 7 yuan from the previous day. In the afternoon, trading outside the market initially reached as high as 6,215 yuan. Later, news about the US and Japan caused sentiment to weaken again, and some people sold at 6,190 yuan. About 2,000 taels were traded in the half-day market. Gold jewelry in silver shops was priced 10 yuan lower, while customs gold remained stable.

The market situation was weak in the early morning, with the opening price down 25 yuan. Money exchange businesses sold 20 taels of bullion from silver shops at 6,175 yuan. Subsequently, due to selling by silver shops and bullion dealers, the price fell another 5 yuan, with silver shops trading 20 taels at 6,170 yuan. After being absorbed by a certain gold firm and retail investors, the price rebounded by 20 yuan, with silver shops trading 40 taels at 6,190 yuan. Afterwards, spot dealers and other long positions in money exchange businesses emerged, causing the price to fall back to 6,180 yuan. Thanks to the renewed efforts of a certain gold firm to push up prices, coupled with the healthy buying appetite of silver shops, the price soon rose to 6,210 yuan. Later, a certain spot dealer resold, but high-priced buyers hesitated, causing the price to fall back to 6,195 yuan. Around noon, a certain silver shop saw an opportunity to cover short positions. Although securities firms provided some supply in the meantime, the news that the foreign exchange market was stable to slightly weaker caused the closing price to finally settle at 6,207 yuan, an increase of 7 yuan from the previous day. The market situation was firm after closing, with transactions taking place at 6,215 yuan. The price fluctuated by 40 yuan in the half-day market. The selling price of bullion held by spot dealers was more than 10 yuan higher for spot gold, while the buying price was reduced by 30 yuan. The current marked gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there were few transactions.

The selling price of gold jewelry per tael in silver shops was 10 yuan lower at 9:30. However, although the gold market fell and then rebounded, the listed price was not raised, resulting in Da Tong Hang revising its price to 630 yuan. The prices of Xin Tong Hang were similar to the previous prices, with buying prices reduced by around 30 yuan.

### British Gold Notes Rise Significantly

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw spot gold prices fall and then rise again. In the afternoon, trading outside the market trended lower again. The price of British and American gold pounds fluctuated within a narrow range and ultimately remained stable. The demand for British gold notes suddenly increased, and the market price rose sharply by 5 jiao. American gold notes fluctuated between 18 yuan 6 jiao 5 fen and 7 jiao 5 fen, ultimately rising slightly by 1 fen from the previous day. The demand for Japanese gold notes remained strong, and the market price continued to rise, increasing to 1 yuan 5 jiao 3 fen in the evening market. The supply and demand for Korean notes was balanced, and the market price remained stable, staying at 1 yuan 1 jiao 8 fen in the evening market.

### Discount Rate Rises Sharply by Five Yuan

Yesterday's discount rate for exchange drafts rose sharply, reversing the previous trend. Due to the excessively low discount rate, holders of cash were cautious and observed the market, resulting in a feeling that even small amounts were difficult to discount. The rate initially rose from around 16 yuan per thousand to 19 yuan for discounting around noon, with a rate of 21 yuan for drawing. In the afternoon, the price was further inflated, reaching a high of 25 yuan. Finally, it eased slightly, with a rate of 20 yuan for discounting and 22 yuan for drawing. However, this was still a sharp increase of 5 yuan. The interest rate for the money industry association rose by 1 fen, with both morning and afternoon markets quoting 1 jiao 2 fen.

### Rice Prices Soar, Foreign Rice Prices Fluctuate

Due to rain reducing the arrival of new rice and the outbreak of war in Vietnam, rice merchants were stimulated, and floating speculators continued to chase prices. Followers inquired in a market atmosphere manipulated by hoarding and speculation, causing prices to rise gradually. Prices for various types of rice rose by nearly one yuan. Although the source of foreign rice remained continuous and inventory was abundant, sentiment was positive due to high domestic rice prices and the situation in Vietnam. Therefore, the market remained firm at closing. Saigon No. 2 rice from Yinghua Company was still quoted at 77 yuan. However, 40-50 tons of Siamese No. 2 rice with foreign expenses were quoted at 74 yuan 8 jiao. There were also over 8,000 bags of foreign rice traded in the spot market, but most of it was speculative trading, with actual sales accounting for less than half. The current prices were 65.50 yuan and 65 yuan for Saigon No. 2, 64.50 yuan and 64 yuan for Siamese No. 2, and 63 yuan 78 jiao for Xiao Jiao. Due to the trend requiring higher prices, the market price for premium foreign rice was not publicly disclosed.

Glutinous rice, both domestic and foreign, also increased by one yuan across the board. Kai Jin Li Special rice was 71 yuan, and Chang Dan rice was around 70 yuan and 69 yuan. The selling price in Hong Kong was similar to that of domestic rice.

Broken and thin japonica rice became scarce due to recent rain, leading to a sense of scarcity amidst the firm prices of foreign rice. As a result, the price rose by one to two yuan. Chang Su japonica rice was heard to be 80 yuan 0.5 jiao, and Su japonica rice was around 79 yuan and 80 yuan. Qing Jiao fresh thin rice was sold for 83 yuan, and Nangang original bags of early rice were 80 yuan, with bulk sales at 78 yuan and 77.5 yuan.

The source of new japonica rice originally relied on bicycle transport, but rain disrupted transportation. Yesterday, only 300-400 piculs arrived from both sides of the river, and prices rose across the board. Japonica rice increased by two yuan, and premium rice increased by one yuan. Kai Zhuan Qiao new japonica rice was 77 yuan and 76.5 yuan. Original bags of Yangjiao premium rice from Jiading Taicang Zhongguan were 67 yuan, with bulk sales at 65.5 yuan and 66 yuan. Qingjiao Dujiao rice was 66 yuan and 65.5 yuan.

### Flour Market Gradually Stabilizes - Wheat Market Remains Firm and Quiet -

The flour market stabilized yesterday. After the No. 2 flour mill revised its price to 16 yuan 5 jiao, the factory indicated that it was unwilling to increase the price further. Reclaimed flour on the market, after reaching a high price of 18 yuan, attracted attention from all parties. A certain factory's announcement of ordering a large quantity of foreign flour also influenced the market, resulting in a gradual stabilization. It was heard that the Dou and Fu factories slightly increased the amount of flour supplied to the street, with each supplying 5,000-6,000 bags to the local and external markets. There were no changes in local and external prices. Foreign flour remained firm and expensive. The supply of fixed-price flour had not been fully confirmed, and the arrival of goods was still distant, making it difficult to calm sentiment. It was heard that 2,000-3,000 bags of Foreign Fortress and Fushou brands were opened, with prices still at 19 yuan.

The wheat market remained firm and quiet yesterday. Japanese and Chinese factories were equally sluggish in their purchases. Because a large amount of foreign wheat had arrived, factories did not seem eager to acquire raw materials, and sellers temporarily lowered their prices due to a lack of supply. As a result, Japanese factories still purchased 2,000-3,000 bags at the original price, while Chinese factories purchased only 100-200 bags, also at the same price of 24 yuan 6 jiao 5 fen to 6 jiao.

### Coarse Grains Yellow Soybeans Rise Slightly

Yellow soybeans are the backbone of coarse grains, so the rise and fall of other grains are inextricably linked to the fluctuations of yellow soybeans. Recently, yellow soybeans have been continuously sold in various markets, but lacking new impetus, they are in a state of hesitation and observation. Yesterday, trading was slightly more active, and prices were slightly higher by two to three jiao compared to the previous market. Transactions included 400 bags of Sangyuan soybeans at 33 yuan 7 jiao, 200 bags of Nanjing soybeans at 33 yuan, dozens of bags of Taicang soybeans at 36 yuan 5 jiao, 300 bags of Anqing soybeans at 33 yuan 6 jiao to 9 jiao, 4 carts of Changzhou Niupi yellow soybeans at 34 yuan 5 jiao, and 50 bags of Chongming Sha yellow soybeans at 32 yuan. Yesterday, 1,355 bags of soybeans were shipped to Hong Kong.

### Securities and Bond Market Sentiment Wavering

Due to rumors in the local market yesterday, the bullish trend in the unofficial securities market was thwarted, and there was a surge of selling. The market was flat in the morning and fell by three to five jiao in the afternoon. The unpredictable nature of the Vietnam situation had caused speculators to take a wait-and-see attitude. As the local rumors could not be confirmed, sentiment was wavering. Floating long positions were unloaded, but absorbed by investors. The trend may be temporarily hovering due to the constantly changing environment, and any slight rebound is bound to be limited. In the morning, Shengda, Xinhua, Lianyi, and Runde were all bought one after another, and the long positions of Hongda gradually sold off. Jiufeng also saw more selling. Other groups mostly sold more and bought less, and market prices were flat. In the afternoon, Hongda continued to sell off, Lianyi also sold off slightly, and Zhenkang, Renchang, and Yitai also sought to sell, causing market prices to weaken sharply. Category C securities broke 6 yuan, and Category B fell by 8 yuan. Xinfu, Tongkang, Dingkang, and Lianhe were bought, resulting in a small recovery at closing. However, the market turned firmer again after closing. As a result, prices uniformly fell by three to four jiao to five and a half jiao. The total number of transactions was about one million yuan. A concise table is provided below.

Stock trading: 40 shares of the Home Industry Cooperative were traded at a price of 82 yuan 5 jiao.

Yesterday, the stock market was volatile. The market opened very stable, but a large number of profit-taking sales brought the market down sharply. Subsequently, due to short covering, prices recovered slightly, but the closing price was still significantly lower than the previous day's close.

London, 24th (Tuesday) dispatch: Today, the listed prices of Chinese foreign debt and Far Eastern British companies remained stagnant. Only the shares of the Mercantile Bank of India, London and China showed some improvement, with the price rising by 3 shillings 9 pence to 6 pounds 11 shillings 3 pence. The rest remained unchanged.

### New Textile Hoarders Vigorously Purchase Cloth

Domestic cloth prices rose yesterday due to continued increases in yarn prices. Customers actively bought, and local dealers and new hoarders outside the industry bought from each other, driving up prices vigorously. Prices of various fabrics rose across the board. Fine cloth and fine twill rose by 2.5 jiao to 7.5 jiao per piece, while lightweight coarse cloth rose by 2.5 jiao to 5 jiao. Wholesale stores on the street traded over 500 pieces of various goods, and Guangdong and Hong Kong dealers traded 500-600 pieces of colored cloth and colored twill. Dealers from the Jiangsu and Anhui hinterland also demanded goods, and there were continued large transactions. Today, 465 pieces of cloth were shipped to Hong Kong.

Local and external parties in the eastern cloth market were unanimously bullish, and the rising trend was particularly strong. Yesterday, the closing price of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth reached a peak of 34 yuan 4 jiao per piece, a sharp increase of 1 yuan per piece. Four Gentlemen Yuan Serge was 9 jiao 9 fen 375, an increase of about 4 fen per yard. The market atmosphere was very tight, with a tendency to continue to rise and increase.

### Seafood and Raw Starch Continue to Be Firm and Expensive

Raw starch has recently become scarcer, while sales remain active, resulting in a continued firm market. The current market prices are 67 yuan for the Flying Unicorn brand, 65 yuan for the 3A brand, 63 yuan for the XKG brand, 55 yuan for the Peacock brand, and 55 yuan for the Double T brand A, representing an increase of 2 yuan to 4 yuan from the previous market. No. 3 starch rose by only 1 yuan to 45 yuan. Large and small grains of sago rice were both sold for 82 yuan, also increasing by 3 yuan.

### Sugar Market: Coarse White and Refined White Stable

The sugar market saw a slight weakening yesterday due to rising foreign exchange rates. According to Dutch telegrams, the price of coarse white sugar was 9.875, and the Hong Kong telegram price was 23.62. The association's quoted price for spot goods was 80 yuan 3 jiao for coarse white sugar arriving at the warehouse in July (old goods) and 77 yuan 9 jiao. Dutch cotton white KD brand remained at 76 yuan. Dutch red spot goods were 63 yuan, down 0.1 jiao. Road goods arriving on September 30 were 62 yuan 5 jiao. Taikoo refined white D brand was 77 yuan 2 jiao, unchanged. DY brand was 75 yuan 4 jiao, up 0.1 jiao. XH brand was 75 yuan 1 jiao, down 0.2 jiao. There were no quotations for domestic sugar.

### North-South Goods: New Almonds Offered

The first batches of new sweet almonds such as North Mountain almonds, Dragon King Hat almonds, and Medium almonds have arrived, but due to their high prices, there have been few transactions. Dragon King Hat almonds are quoted at 320 yuan, and Medium almonds are quoted at 250-260 yuan. The buyers' bids are far from the asking prices and have not yet approached.

### Hainan Longan Continues to Rise Sharply

Longan stores have already run out of stock. New goods from production areas such as Xinghua, Quanzhou, Anhai, Tong'an, and Zhangzhou have all entered the market. Due to transportation difficulties, Xinghua, Quanzhou, and Anhai are unlikely to arrive in Shanghai for the time being. Although Zhangzhou and Tong'an could be shipped to Xiamen and then to Shanghai, there is also a lack of transportation due to the official opening of sailing ships. Currently, only Hainan-produced hanging longan is arriving in larger quantities and is relatively cheaper. The lowest price was 124-125 yuan, which then rose to 134-135 yuan. Recently, quoted prices have become tighter, and the market rose by more than ten yuan yesterday.

### North-South Goods: Black Melon Seeds Arrive with Low Inventory, Price Rises by Ten Yuan

Black melon seeds have recently become scarce in terms of arrivals and inventory, and production prices have also risen, resulting in a strong rebound in prices. Yesterday, Xu Kui seeds were quoted at 98 yuan, and Xiangcheng seeds at 94 yuan, both up by about 10 yuan. Mingguang seeds were 84 yuan, up 7 yuan.

Yesterday, 400 bags of peanuts and 550 bags of peanut kernels were shipped to Hong Kong.

### Red Beans Rise by Twenty to Thirty Yuan

Longan is approaching the market and there is no replacement. The current spot is relatively thin so the market is up so it's not easy to relax for a while.

### Hardware: New Lead Wire Stagnant, but Firm

Since the Tianjin group stopped handling new lead wire, the market has been sluggish. However, inventory is very low and the source has been cut off, so standard prices remain firm. Yesterday, medium-grade goods such as #16 to #20 were sold for 85 yuan per dan, while fine colors such as #21 to #25 required 105 yuan per dan. It is estimated that only dozens of dan were traded throughout the city.

### Miscellaneous Cigarettes About to Have Taxes "Increased," Market Prices Rising Steadily

Amidst various rumors about increased cigarette taxes, various cigarette factories have halted shipments, causing public panic and brisk trading in the market. Those in need are raising prices to acquire them, while those holding inventory are reluctant to sell, causing the prices of all brands to rise sharply compared to last week. Yesterday's opening prices were: Great Britain Brand at 1,410 yuan, Old Knife Brand at 930 yuan, Pin Hai Brand at 845 yuan, Wu Hua Brand at 605 yuan, Little Fairy Brand at 685 yuan, Beauty Brand at 710 yuan, and Golden Rat Brand at 400 yuan.

### Not a Sacrifice

— Chen Ming

On the 17th of this month, this newspaper published an article by Mr. Yan Zheng titled "The Wife's Sacrifice," the main idea of which is that his wife graduated from a famous girls' middle school in Shanghai, excelling in both character and academics. They initially planned to return home late together after marriage, each fulfilling their responsibilities to the nation and society. Unexpectedly, after having children… his wife had no choice but to abandon her books and ideals, turning into a housekeeper preoccupied with the vegetable market, kitchen, and bedroom. This was a huge sacrifice, making him constantly feel ashamed and wanting to hide! However, she enthusiastically educated their children, as if entrusting her hopes to them. So, even though her eldest younger sister wrote from northern Shaanxi, saying, "Sister is not a mediocre person; on the contrary, you are several times stronger than I am. How unfortunate that you are now buried in trivial family matters!" (This letter made him ashamed once again), she simply smiled and said nothing. In the end, he said with great emotion: "I wonder how many others have made sacrifices like my wife!"

I deeply sympathize with Mr. Yan's sentiments. My wife used to be a university student in Hangzhou, excelling in debate and possessing strong organizational skills, often taking on important roles in extracurricular activities. As a result, her teachers predicted that she would become a leading figure in society. Unexpectedly, the August 13th Incident occurred, preventing her from returning to Hangzhou to study. Moreover, due to the nature of my job, I might have to leave Shanghai at any time. Therefore, after careful consideration and agreement, we held our wedding in the winter of the 26th year. It has been almost three years now, and we already have one child, with another one coming soon. Not to mention that she hasn't participated in any group activities in these three years, even her fluent debating skills have become rusty due to prolonged disuse, not as smooth as before. Looking ahead, it's unlikely that she will ever participate in social activities again because her entire heart and soul have been completely occupied by her family and children. Even if I occasionally invite her to a movie, she always chatters incessantly about family matters and whether the children are warm enough, unable to relax and enjoy herself. People like this, buried in family and children, naturally cannot be expected to become a "leading figure" in society. In Mr. Yan's words, she has "made a sacrifice."

However, my wife and I do not consider this a sacrifice. We believe that a woman managing household affairs and taking care of children at home is also a career, requiring considerable knowledge, just like a man serving in society. If we advocate for saving the nation through our respective roles, then those housewives who manage their homes well are truly fulfilling their responsibilities and should be praised. As the saying goes, excellent citizens come from excellent families. Doesn't this illustrate how important wives are to the family and society! Many virtuous housewives can fill their families with a pleasant atmosphere. On one hand, she can quickly help her husband recover from the fatigue of work or reinvigorate him from career disappointments and frustration. On the other hand, she can provide her children with improved home education, cultivating correct life perspectives and acquiring necessary knowledge from an early age, turning them into healthy citizens in the future. So, although they don't directly serve in society, they actually have the power to promote and transform society. Their contributions are not obvious, but their existence is indispensable to the country!

Initially, I also felt uneasy about my wife being confined to such a small circle within the family, as if I had harmed her career and great future. But now my thinking has changed. I have discovered that her career is managing the family, and her future is educating her children! This statement may not be agreeable to those who advocate for women's participation in politics, but based on my observation, my wife's dedication to her children and family is not due to environmental coercion or merely a sense of responsibility, but rather a completely voluntary act, a manifestation of her natural instincts! She does not consider her current life a sacrifice at all, nor does she complain. On the contrary, she happily takes on these many heavy new tasks. My wife's attitude certainly cannot represent all women, but I believe that Mr. Yan's wife must be her comrade, and there must be many other women who hold the same attitude!

Finally, I hope that Mr. Yan and everyone who shares his feelings need not feel ashamed any longer. You should do your best to assist your wives, sincerely cooperate with them, and use the principle of division of labor to make your families ideal families. Do what you should do. I believe that this is the true essence of equal rights for men and women, and this is what our country and society need from us now!

### Grandfather

— Jian Ye

My hometown has been bombed again and again, and the news is that our house has been destroyed.

I think of my nearly ninety-year-old grandfather, unable to sleep in the middle of the night, putting on his long gown, and gazing at the stars and moon in the darkness.

The moon is round, and I hear the family next door celebrating their reunion. Oh, today is the Mid-Autumn Festival, a day for reunion.

Grandfather's aged figure flickers among the stars. Sparse, long whiskers trail from his mouth, and his bright eyes emit a light of detachment and kindness, gazing around (perhaps searching for children lost in the darkness?).

Grandfather is the one who supports the whole family, who feeds us, who makes us grow up. Grandfather is stern, yet he is not harsh. Grandfather has a strong body, which is due to his regulated daily life.

You know that Grandfather's life lies in the word "normal." He has normal actions, he has a normal life. He is frugal, he never wastes, he never discards any paper or object. "Utilizing waste" is one of his habits and also one of his cultivations.

But his advantages are not limited to these.

Imagine a person who was born in the Xianfeng era of the late Qing Dynasty, and he does not have any generation gap with the children of the later generations. How rare is this! He reads the newspaper every day, and he maintains his faith—the same faith as 470 million people. With his blurred old eyes, he is hoping for victory, the ultimate victory of the motherland!

However, my hometown has been bombed, and there is no news of Grandfather.

Looking at the stars and the moon, the starlight is so faint that it cannot be seen, and the moon is broken.

Hawthorne Case

### The Whereabouts of the Dance Queen

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter VIII Capturing Two People

I no longer heard that person speaking, but heard the sound of his leather shoes moving forward at an accelerated pace. I was still walking in the opposite direction, but the speed of my steps and the speed of his steps were exactly inversely proportional. After a while, the sound of his footsteps could no longer be heard. I estimated that he had turned the corner. I suddenly turned around, almost colliding head-on with Little Li, scaring him into taking a step back. I quickly waved my hand, signaling him not to make a sound, and then with large and nimble steps, dashed straight to the turning point. I immediately crouched down and peered towards the entrance of number 556. Zhao Boxiong was also hunching over, pressing his ear against the door to listen. He had obviously suspected that the friend in the room was not his true friend. His body straightened up, and he pondered slightly. Suddenly, his right hand quickly reached into his pocket. Looking from the turning point, even though there was a distance of nearly ten yards and the light was not very bright, I could still see his right hand, when pulled out of his pocket, holding a black pistol! He straightened up again and considered for a moment, then placed his left hand on the doorknob. After his hand gripped the doorknob, it seemed to pause for two or three seconds, hesitating again. In fact, this was not a pause; he was clearly slowly rotating it, trying not to let Hawthorne inside discover his actions outside the door, so that he could suddenly pounce in.

This was a tense moment, and of course I could no longer lie still! I released my steps and rushed straight over. My pistol had already left my pocket. By the time I rushed to the entrance of number 556, Zhao Boxiong had opened the door halfway, his left foot striding into the doorway and his right foot still outside, his right hand holding the gun frozen in an awkward posture, about to raise it but not yet. I quickly raised my pistol, pointing it at the spinal area behind his back, while my lips issued a low and forceful command at the same time.

"Don't move!"

At this moment, a series of giggling laughter pierced my ears. The laughter only increased my excitement. It turned out that the one laughing was Que Sang. Hawthorne was standing inside the doorway, but because Zhao Boxiong's figure was tall and wide, he concealed Que Sang, so I hadn't seen her. (118)

Medicine

### Blood Therapy

— Shi Lü

Almost everyone knows now that for those who have suffered misfortunes and patients with severe bleeding, the most effective treatment is blood transfusion. Blood transfusion involves taking a certain amount of blood from a healthy stranger who has undergone rigorous testing (especially blood type) and injecting it into the patient's body.

However, it has recently been discovered that blood from relatives can cure children suffering from certain diseases and has significant and beautiful effects. In some cases, it can even save lives on the verge of death. Dr. Fiala recently published the results of his experiments. First, he applied blood therapy using parents' blood to children suffering from dangerous complications of scarlet fever, such as pneumonia and meningitis

(whose lives were threatened by death); he used a small amount of their father's or mother's blood for intramuscular injection, and soon, some of them completely recovered their health. In all cases, none developed terrible complications. Therefore, the hospital adopted it as a specific medicine for scarlet fever in pediatrics.

In addition, the same method can achieve the goal for less dangerous measles in children. When a child is infected with measles by his brother or sister, a small injection of the parent's blood is enough to avoid it. This is most useful in many cases, such as when a weak child also has other diseases. In fact, as long as people have had measles once, an antibody will always exist in the blood: but the special effectiveness of blood from relatives, precisely what it is that can cure scarlet fever and measles, is not fully known today.

### Money

— Zhou Zi

Money is a good servant, but also a bad master.

Money is like a bottomless sea, in which honor, conscience, and truth can all be drowned.

The benefit of money lies entirely in using it properly.

### From Ugly Feet to Jia Duocai and Sun Shengwu (Part 1)

— Plum Blossom Pavilion Master

"Sheng, Dan, Jing, Mo, Chou" are the main roles in an opera troupe. Although the role of the clown is relatively minor, his use is very extensive. Except for a few plays that only have Sheng and Dan, "Fen He Wan Wu Jia Po..." the rest, whether literary or martial plays, large or small plays, old or new plays, can be said to have the clown's share. There is a saying in the opera troupe called "No clown, no play". From this saying, you can know that the clown's position in Beijing opera is not minor, and it is very important.

Books say that the character "Chou" is an abbreviated writing of the character "酉"; and Lin Wushan, a famous Ping opera performer in the early days, said that Chou means "ugly." I remember that he published the following passage before his death:

"Chou means ugly. The one who plays the ugly role, the best is to not be ugly but ugly, the middle is to be ugly but not ugly, and the worst is to be both ugly and ugly."

At that time, the second young master Yuan Baocun very much agreed with this interpretation, and even boasted that his own clown plays were qualified to be "not ugly but ugly." (The young master is good at Kunqu and Huang opera is famous for clown plays. The role of Tang Biaoli in Shen Tou Ci Tang is unrestrained and cold, unparalleled at the time. It is said that he learned from the famous clown Ke Xiushan). I will not mention who is good and who is bad among the deceased clowns. I might as well talk about a few who are still making a living on the red carpet.

In my personal opinion, Xiao Changhua is a typical clown figure. His performance on stage is not only good in manner, but also has a naturally good voice, clear and bright, sweet and tasty. It is really enjoyable to listen to. His plays are best known for the square towel clown (such as Jiang Gan in Qun Ying Hui, Tang Qin in Yi Peng Xue). The shopkeeper in Lian Sheng Dian, the doctor who asks for medicine, Wang Banxian in Qing Shi Shan, Qiao Xi in Gan Lu Si, Chong Gongdao in Nü Qi Jie, and Zhang Biego in Wu Pen Ji are all his famous masterpieces. Although he is old now, his spirit is still very good, and his performance is still the same as it was more than ten years ago. Ci Ruiquan is also a well-known veteran actor. His roles as the peddler in "Shuang Ling Ji", Sai Xishi in "Neng Ren Si", Chong Gongdao in "Nü Qi Jie", the old soldier in "Zhu Lian Zhai", and Jia Gui in "Fa Men Si" are all very exciting. It is a pity that he lacks some elegance in playing the square towel clown. The reason why he cannot be on par with Xiao Changhua is because of this reason. Although Ma Fulu is a popular actor, his skills are really not flattering. He is glib and useless. However, his cross-dressing as the old woman in "De Yi Yuan" is quite decent. Ru Fuhui is Xiao Changhua's apprentice, and his skills are really good; Jia Gui in Fa Men Si; Zhang Biego in Wu Pen Ji: Tang Qin in Yi Peng Xue, Jiang Gan in Qun Ying Hui, all follow the style of Mr. Xiao, but he suffers from being too short. Cao Ergeng is very good and his speech is also very clear. Cheng Yanqiu has always valued him very much; his father is the famous Kunqu master Cao Xinquan, who wrote a lot in his later years and made considerable contributions to Kunqu opera. Unfortunately, he is now deceased. In addition, I also appreciate two people, one is the talented Jia Duocai, and the other is the rising star Sun Shengwu.

### After Watching the Performance of "Stars Drama Society"

— Meng Bai

The Stars Drama Society recently performed for the first time at the Lafayette Theater, with a total of three plays.

The first play is "The Persecuted" written by Wu Tian. It is indeed very valuable to perform it in Shanghai at this time and place. Li Li's Amao and Hua Ying's Cuihua were quite successful, but in some places the lines were not very familiar. Mo Yi's Chen Sanzhen looked like an old man, but his body could be lifted a little bit. Lü Ping's Da Jinzi and Gu Yue's Yu Zui both fully demonstrated the style of Shanghai playboys. Several climaxes were very good.

The second one is "Marlin". Li Li's Shi Haoren fully demonstrated his personality. Luo Ka's Manager Jia's makeup was not very good. Ling Ping's Wu Huang, Jie Fei's Wan Fangmang, Meng Qian's Bei Yi, and Mo Yi's Wang Pinsan were all quite successful. Meimei's Ma

The third is the comedy "Fiancés". It is very difficult to handle a comedy with four actors, but they performed very successfully. The plot is very compact and always grasps the psychology of the audience. Qi Zi performed the best, and Qiu He's landlord was also very realistic. Yan Ping and Peng Fei were both mediocre.

Other aspects such as lighting, effects, and makeup were also quite good, which are unmatched by other amateur drama societies, especially in decoration. In short, the first public performance of the society was able to achieve such good results, which are all due to the daily efforts of the members. I hope that the society can continue to work hard and its future will definitely be bright.

### Research on the Characters in the Confucius Movie (5)

— Written by Tianye, Painting by Qingniao

The State of Qi was strong and close to Lu. Lu was the hometown of Confucius. He first served as the chief of Zhongdu under Duke Ding, and then as the Minister of Justice. Duke Jing of Qi was afraid that Lu would be well governed. His minister Li Zu first suggested to Duke Ding to have a meeting at Jiagu, and used military force to coerce him, but he was eventually defeated by Confucius's righteousness. Qi then presented beautiful women and music to Duke Ding of Lu, who enjoyed them and did not attend court for three days. Confucius knew that it was impossible to do anything, so he abandoned his position and left.

Yang Hu, whose name was Huo, was a family minister of the senior official Jisun of Lu. Shao Zhengmao was a senior official of Lu, famous throughout the country, but Confucius executed him for disrupting the government after being the prime minister for seven days. Confucius said that Shao Zhengmao was "rebellious and dangerous in his heart, eccentric and tight in his actions, hypocritical and eloquent in his words, and agreeable to falsehood." Yang Huo then plotted to rebel against the country. When the matter failed, he fled to Qi. Qi did not accept him, so he fled to Jin. He eventually helped Kuai Kui seize the throne of the Duke of Wei, and was ridiculed by later generations.

### Rare Scraps from the Opera World (10) (3)

— Shan

(Thirteen)

Ci Ruiquan loves to watch foreign films. He said that the reason he loves to watch foreign films is: "This is like listening to Beijing opera. Watching Chinese films is like watching Shanghai-style operas, and watching foreign films is completely our stuff!" Someone saw him in the corner of the cinema, wearing a sweat towel around his waist, with a funny expression, not inferior to Chaplin.

In addition to raising medical dogs, Song Dezhu also likes to raise pigeons. A year ago, there were almost forty pigeons of various colors, but he loves the iron-winged type the most. It is said that: "When it flies, it really looks like a big butterfly." He does not have a fixed time for releasing pigeons. Even in strong winds and storms, he has to show off his skills, so now there are only more than ten left.

(Fifteen)

In a certain year, Mei Wan Hua and Yang Xiao Lou performed Chang Ban Po in Tianjin. When Mei's wife jumped into the well, Zhao Yun would usually grab her yellow cloak. On that day, Mei tied his belt too tightly, and he could not grab it several times. After the scene, Mei said to people: "This job in the opera business is really not easy!"

The martial arts actor Zhang Delu has very good martial arts skills. He likes to drink, and he can drink more than ten catties at a time. He is very good at guessing fingers. In the past, he was known as the "King of Boxing and Wine" in the acting world. I wonder if he still has such a large capacity now?

(Seventeen)

Zhang Rongkui is a rare remaining senior old actor after Lao Tan. A few years ago, he only took one hundred yuan for a package at the Grand Stage. One day, Zhao Ruquan, the backstage manager, wanted him to perform a play called Zhan Taiping during the daytime on Sunday. He refused on the grounds that he "could not sing." Later, he reluctantly agreed to perform it once, and the package was increased from one hundred yuan to one hundred and eighty yuan, but he then cheaply spread the news the next day. He said: "My package is only worth one hundred yuan!" For a time, he was known as a fool.
