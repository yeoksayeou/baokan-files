### US Flying Fortresses to be Transferred to Britain Soon

Washington - According to well-informed sources here, the United States will send its renowned B-17 Flying Fortress bombers to Britain. The date of President Roosevelt's signing of the necessary documents authorizing the manufacturers to transfer these bombers to Britain has not yet been determined. However, it is known that this action will be realized soon. An authoritative source told a Reuters reporter that it would not be surprising if thirty Flying Fortress bombers were to fly to Botwood, Newfoundland, within the week. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)

### On the Eve of the Reopening of the Burma Road, China and Britain Intensify Cooperation; Ambassador Guo Holds Extensive Talks with British Foreign Secretary; US Supplies China with Rice, Wheat, Medicine, etc.

London - Chinese Ambassador to Britain, Guo Taiqi, visited British Foreign Secretary Halifax last night for a 45-minute meeting, followed by a lengthy discussion with Foreign Undersecretary Butler. The talks reportedly proceeded in an excellent atmosphere. Chinese sources stated that the possibility of Sino-British cooperation was one of the topics discussed, actually including aid. According to other sources, Ambassador Guo and Undersecretary Butler discussed issues arising from the British government's decision to reopen the Burma Road. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)

Washington - The Red Cross announced yesterday that 500 tons of rice and wheat for Chinese refugees were shipped from Seattle to China this week on the "Colin Swallower" vessel. It also stated that medicine and cloth would be urgently shipped from New York on Saturday and Sunday aboard the "Washington" vessel, which is evacuating American citizens from the Far East, to Rangoon and then transported to Free China via the soon-to-be-opened Burma Road. According to the Red Cross's plan, it is very clear that these supplies will not be transported to Japanese-occupied areas in China. (United Press dispatch, 16th)

Lashio, Burma - 100,000 tons of goods destined for China have already been stockpiled in warehouses here, with another 500,000 tons stored in Rangoon, all awaiting the opening of the Burma Road at midnight on Sunday. British customs officials stationed at the border will begin inspection procedures so that the goods can start heading to China by 2:00 PM on Thursday. (United Press dispatch, 16th)

Lashio, Burma - Chinese and British officials have recently made final preparations for the reopening of the Burma Road. 10,000 tons of goods for China are waiting for inspection here. Officials from the Southwest Transportation Office of China and British officials from the Lashio Customs are working intensely, speeding up preparations and discussing technical issues related to the reopening of the road. Firearms, aircraft, and other goods that are currently prohibited will not be transported immediately upon the road's opening, but may be shipped a few days later. (Associated Press dispatch, 16th)

Chongqing - While Chinese authorities are placing great importance on the reopening of the Burma Road on Friday, there will likely not be a moving official ceremony or a large number of trucks passing through the road on that day. The rumor that 2,000-3,000 trucks will cross the border on Friday is largely wishful thinking, as the Chinese side seems to be in no hurry now that the road has been opened. In fact, Chinese authorities will carefully avoid concentrating a large number of trucks.

### British Ambassador to the US Returns Home by Plane to Discuss Far East Issues; US Ambassador Will Also Return to Washington for Consultations

New York - British Ambassador to the United States, Lord Lothian, suddenly returned to Europe by plane yesterday, which was quite unexpected. People here are speculating that his sudden return to his country is due to the British government's urgent need to consult the United States on its attitude towards the reopening of the Burma Road. They hope that cooperation between Britain and the United States will be enhanced after the British ambassador returns to his country for consultations. Although diplomatic circles believe that the British ambassador will primarily discuss Far Eastern issues in London, Washington seems to perceive a slight easing of the situation in the Far East, as the authorities do not want the people to feel that Roosevelt's foreign policy is risky. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 16th)

Washington - Secretary of State Hull stated that the US Ambassador to Britain, Kennedy, will depart from London for Washington within a week or ten days. As far as he knows, Kennedy will return to his post after returning to his country for consultations. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)

Chongqing - Well-informed circles in Chongqing today, on the eve of the reopening of the Burma Road, anticipate that Britain and the United States will have a tough new policy to deal with the very tense situation in the Far East. Chongqing officials predict that Anglo-American policy will unanimously become more proactive and forceful in order to strengthen the positions of both countries. It is said here today that the Chongqing government does not plan to have any commemorative ceremony for the reopening of the Burma Road, but if Japan carries out its threat to bomb the road, appropriate and effective methods and preparations have been planned to ensure that transport vehicles continue to travel on the road.

### US Warships Sail to Hawaii; French Newspaper Comments on US Position in the Far East; Major Actions Possible After the Election

San Pedro, California - Twelve squadrons of the US fleet sailed from here to Hawaii yesterday to join the US fleet there. It is believed that these twelve squadrons of warships will conduct technical exercises en route to Honolulu. It is reported that other squadrons of the US fleet, originally scheduled to return to Hawaii yesterday, will enter dry docks here and in San Francisco for repairs, including the battleships "New Mexico," "Mississippi," and "Arizona," and two destroyers. (Associated Press dispatch, 16th)

Lyon, France - "Le Temps" recently published an editorial commenting on the attitude of the United States in the current international situation, stating, "Since the signing of the Tripartite Pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan, the reaction of the United States has been understood by the world, but its position does not seem to have changed significantly. At most, it has requested the Japanese government to explain its current foreign policy. Although the American press and public opinion have unanimously expressed strong opposition to the Tripartite Pact and believe that no matter what explanations are made by the Japanese Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, this alliance directly threatens the United States, the US government has not taken any formal action that would make us believe that a military clash between the United States and Japan is unavoidable. In short, in the three weeks before the election, the position of the United States will remain the same, and no changes will occur. However, once the election results are announced, it may take major actions in the Pacific to change its current position." (Havas dispatch, 15th)

### US Embargo on Steel Shipments to Japan Takes Effect Yesterday; Trade Relations Between US and Japan in a "Semi-War" State

New York - The US ban on scrap iron and steel exports to Japan took effect last night. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)

Tokyo - The Miyako Shimbun wrote exclusively this morning that Japan believes the American people do not want war, but Japan does not doubt that American public opinion advocates giving the greatest aid to China and Britain outside of war. The US ban on scrap iron and steel shipments to Japan will take effect today. It is possible that the United States holds the key to war and peace. However, war is a game that both sides can play, and the other side can proclaim it as much as it wants. Who can guarantee that the United States can safely play this game? The newspaper also listed 76 types of US export bans on the front page, stating that the Burma Road will reopen on Saturday, and the will of the United States is clearly visible. Japan will not take counter-measures. The paper also carried an editorial criticizing President Roosevelt for using war panic to win votes, saying that wearing iron armor and a priest's robe cannot deceive people for long, and now he will enter the arena fully armed. In addition to the newspaper's commentary, Tokyo is paying tribute to the war dead from today, so everything is in a state of holiday. Tomorrow is the Autumn Harvest Festival, a national holiday, and a semi-annual holiday for newsboys, so newspapers will also cease publication. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)

Tokyo - The Asahi Shimbun said that cooperation between the United States and Britain is too deeply involved in Far Eastern affairs, and now it seems impossible to retreat. The US government's advice to American residents in the Far East to evacuate indicates that the US government will go to war with Japan if necessary, which remains to be seen. The US government seems to be in a dilemma with regard to Japan, namely (1) it must completely sever economic relations with Japan, or even resort to force if necessary, to maintain the status quo in East Asia. If so, aid to Britain will be greatly reduced and greatly reduced. (2) It cannot allow the Atlantic Ocean to be controlled by a third country, so it must help Britain maintain full control of the ocean. The Asahi Shimbun believes that if Britain wins the European war, the United States will not have difficulty solving these two problems, but if Britain fails, the United States will not be able to take an offensive against Japan. Some people believe that severing economic relations between Japan and the United States is sufficient to restrain Japan, while others believe that this move will encourage the Japanese government's southward advance policy and lead to war between the two countries. But in any case, trade relations between the two countries today can be considered to be in a "semi-war state." For this reason, trade relations between the two countries have made it almost impossible to ship Japanese goods to the United States and obtain foreign exchange. The British move to reopen the Burma Road has increased aid to the Chongqing government. The United Kingdom and the United States are also using various strategies to win over the Soviet Union, all of which are retaliatory plans for the conclusion of a mutual assistance agreement between Germany, Italy, and Japan. If Britain is not confident in winning the European war, and if it does not obtain a promise of full military assistance from the United States, so that the two countries are on an equal footing to fight Japan, then it will not abandon its appeasement policy towards Japan. This is obvious. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)

### Military Affairs in the Philippines to be Commanded by the United States

Washington - Plans for the US to command military affairs in the Philippines in the event of an incident in the Far East have been completed. Military authorities say the plan is a precautionary measure and there is no immediate need to implement it, but if deemed necessary, the President will announce it to take effect. It also cited Section 2 of the Philippine Independence Act, saying that while the US has the right to carry out extraordinary military strategies, the government does not intend to implement any plans without consulting the Philippine authorities. It is also reported that Resident Commissioner of the Philippines, Anrichaelte, and Speaker of the Philippine Assembly, Yuro, are preparing to discuss with the Department of the Army in hopes of obtaining a plan that will allow the US to provide military gifts and armaments to the Philippines.

Editorial

### The Japanese Political Situation Under the New Order Movement

It has been exactly three months since Konoe reassumed power. During this period, he has expressed his political ambitions to a considerable extent, and has been engaged in major international adventures with a stubborn attitude. Of course, Japan's ambition to dominate East Asia with its southward expansion policy, and its conclusion of the Tripartite Pact with Germany and Italy, both have their roots in past history, and did not begin to brew only after Konoe resumed office this time. However, Konoe differs from his cautious predecessors in that he has implemented one by one the adventurous policies that they dared not recklessly adopt. In addition to the turbulent influence of the international situation, he undoubtedly has the support of the New Order Movement, also known as the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, which has been renamed recently. In his ideal, he roughly believes that through this movement, Japan can enter the category of totalitarianism; unified political leadership can control the economic, political, military, and even social levels and the entire nation; he is confident that Japan will not find it difficult to build a highly national defense state and compete with Germany and Italy, so as to engage in the redistribution of the world. Regarding the merits and demerits of the totalitarian system, we are not willing to criticize it now; but in the eyes of Japanese reformers, this is already recognized as the only way out; their adherence to Germany and Italy is almost no different from their admiration for Western Europe's freedom and democracy seventy years ago.

Looking back, the order in which Japan decided to change its political system and foreign policy does not quite coincide with the ideals of the reformists; in Germany and Italy, the totalitarian system was already quite consolidated and successful before it began to expand outward; but today's Japan is only preparing to solve its difficulties by changing its political system when its foreign adventures have reached a dead end. Moreover, the reform movement is just beginning to sprout, and its foreign adventurous actions are accelerating sharply, in contrast, one side is moving as slowly as a snail, while the other is chasing the wind and electricity; if the implementation of the latter is to be based on the achievements of the former, then premature harvesting and overstepping the mark, it is truly unknown how Konoe and others will reconcile the two, and how they will come together? However, Japan's empty and weak strength, fragmented and uncertain, is thus increasingly seen by the world through this gap.

Although Konoe's New Order Movement began long before he took power this time, its origin can be traced back to the Ogikubo Conference in the winter of 1936; but the form and specific application of this movement are still in the ignorant stage; what it has achieved is only the upper-level organizational array that has been realized after several transformations. Initially, what Konoe used to appeal was the New Party Movement, but after the establishment of the New Political System Preparation Committee, the meaning of forming a party gradually weakened; Konoe even solemnly stated that although it has a high degree of political nature, it is not a political party, and the reasons for this are difficult to understand. By the time the Imperial Rule Assistance Association replaced the New Political System Preparation Committee and was formally established, the so-called new political system did not seem to represent the reform of the political system itself, but only the nature of "assisting the monarch in handling state affairs" (see the outline passed by the Preparation Committee on September 13). At the same time, although the so-called Imperial Rule Assistance Association organization claims that all citizens of the country should participate, it only appoints cadres from top to bottom by the government, which has nothing to do with the people; although there is a National Cooperation Conference set up in its third and fourth layers to serve as an organ for lower-level sentiments to reach the top, the person in charge is the prominent right-wing giant, Suemitsu Masao, who is appointed as the chairman. With such a fragmented and peculiar organization, if it is said that it can shoulder the heavy responsibility of Japan's current difficult situation and make it comparable to Germany and Italy, that is truly an unimaginable future miracle.

Even with regard to the Imperial Rule Assistance Association itself, it has its own inherent weaknesses: First, the so-called unified leadership must of course be able to command the military; although Tojo has now agreed to participate in this movement as the representative of the three heads of the Army Ministry, active-duty soldiers will not join; the Navy's attitude is roughly the same; this clearly shows that the military is unwilling to submit and promote the unification of command and politics. Now that the Imperial Rule Assistance Association has just been established, the Kokumin Shimbun, the mouthpiece of the military, is already attacking the "fierce competition for personnel in the process of its establishment, which has exhausted the ugliness of the world," and seriously criticizing Konoe's compromise with the old forces. It is not difficult to predict how the military will feel about this movement in the future. Second, the core meaning of establishing a highly national defense lies mainly in the economic aspect; according to the basic policy decided by the Preparation Committee on September 19, it is to properly gather agriculture, industry, and commerce together to create a new system in which production, distribution, and consumption are linked together, and to integrate all large, medium, and small industries into the same system based on cooperative associations; this goal is indeed surprisingly high, but it is unknown how its so-called creation and integration will be concretely carried out in order to overcome the major resistance in the economic world and the stubborn feudal nature of the Japanese industrial world? Regarding this point, there is still not a single word mentioned. Third, the so-called core personnel of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, even if the military attacks its excessive accommodation to the old forces and old-style political activists, the reformers are almost included without omission: the richness of its network is almost painstaking; but what it has achieved is only a mixture of physical phenomena, and lacks the fusion of chemical effects; as a result, only its complexity and contradictions are seen, and coordination is difficult, and it cannot achieve the effect of fusion and unification. In addition, if it is stipulated that the president of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association should be concurrently held by the prime minister, that will make Japan's political situation lose its flexible adjustment. If a political tide occurs again by chance, it is truly unimaginable how it will evolve to make amends.

The so-called reform movement originally had no deep foundation in Japan, and its momentum was less than two or three out of ten from spontaneity, and seven or eight out of ten from external instigation. Therefore, the recent situation of the New Order Movement, although not inactive on the surface; but looking coldly at the conservative camp, rather than disappearing, it is better to say that it is observing the situation in silence. In principle, whether the New Order can promote foreign adventures is already a big question. If its foreign actions suffer a major setback, or if the Axis powers suffer defeat, then it will definitely draw a new era in the evolution of the Japanese political situation.

### British Ambassador to the United States Returns Home for Consultation

New York - The British Ambassador to the United States, Lothian, left here yesterday on the "Yankee Clipper" en route to London via Lisbon. The British ambassador boarded the plane unexpectedly after other passengers and nine crew members had been seated and were waiting for takeoff. Lothian's decision to return to England has caused considerable surprise, as he announced last week that he would postpone his trip to London indefinitely due to the tension in the Far East.

### President Roosevelt's Broadcast Explains the Profound Significance of Conscription; Defending Freedom is the Inherent Duty of Citizens; Preparing to Respond to the Threat of War

Washington - President Roosevelt recently delivered a speech to the nation during "Draft Day," when 16,404,000 Americans began registering for military service, condemning absolutism and explaining the importance of conscription in responding to external threats. The President also used the American conscription practices of 300 years ago as an argument to explain the necessity of American conscription and the reasons for taking this step. The President said that those who dare to threaten the world with war and those who create and engage in the term "total war" have made us and all free nations feel "the necessity of national defense." Therefore, he advocated preparing to respond to the threat of foreign aggression. The President continued, "More than sixteen million American youth today have returned to the old American custom of conscription of three hundred years ago, and are engaged in fulfilling the first and inherent duty of free citizens. In the early colonial days, every able-bodied citizen was required to serve in the military to defend the country. Today is a day of profound significance and purpose in the lives of all of us Americans, for we Americans are today declaring the vitality of our nation's history, the unity of our will, and the unity of our nation. We are prepared to ensure that this new world, created by free people for free people to live in, remains peaceful forever. The United States, with 130 million people, currently has only 500,000 officers and soldiers in the ranks of the army and the national guard. I do not know that the armies of other countries with fewer people already have five or six million trained people. Our current program is to train another 800,000 people next year, and about one million people each year thereafter. This program is of a defensive and precautionary nature. We must remain calm and not be alarmed. We have now decided to build cannons, airplanes, tanks, warships, and all other kinds of modern national defense tools. We have also begun to mobilize our citizens to prove that after men are called up, women, property, and money will also unite to make national defense effective. Today's registration for military service is an important key to our national defense. When our ancestors laid the foundation of democracy, every American family had a gun and knew how to use it. Today, we live under the threat of foreign aggression, and we must again make the same preparations and precautions. We must again have the same spirit as those who are prepared to protect what they have created, protect what they have managed, and protect what they worship. Those who dare to threaten the world with war, those who create and engage in the term 'total war,' have made us and all free nations feel the necessity of 'total defense.' Today is not only a day to shoulder this responsibility, but also to create a program to act freely and consistently, to continue to build the American continent, and to truly gain freedom for the people who will be called into the army. I now declare to the sixteen million American youth who are registering today that democracy is the goal you are engaged in. Democracy is a form of society that can guarantee the rights of thought of every generation of people and make the world a better place." The President then condemned absolutism, saying that under absolutism, human beings are never allowed to use their thoughts to help improve the world. The President continued, "Today, if God blesses us, we will give the Americans of tomorrow a country that is maintained by freedom and justice. To realize this kind of country, we must devote ourselves to the purpose of peace. The mutual alliance of the American countries, the development of national spirit and national strength by us Americans today, is for peace." (16th Associated Press Dispatch)

It is also reported that President Roosevelt will deliver a national broadcast at 8:00 AM, declaring this day to be "Draft Registration Day." (16th Associated Press Dispatch)

### Content of US Conscription Law

Washington - The main provisions of the US Conscription Law will be implemented in the middle of next week. The contents of these provisions are roughly as follows:

(1) Regarding Registrants - All people who have passed their twenty-first birthday and have not reached their thirty-first birthday must register. This registration applies equally to both nationals and foreigners. However, foreigners who have not declared their willingness to become American citizens may be exempt from conscription. Nationals with families must also register. Registration is handled by selected officials. Active duty personnel, reservists, and trainees in the Army, National Guard, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard, personnel engaged in surveying and public health affairs, and officials (excluding employees) of the federal government and state governments are all exempt from registration.

(2) Regarding Conscription - This bill provides for the conscription of 900,000 people to engage in training at any time. 400,000 people may be conscripted this fall. The order of conscription is determined by lottery. The lottery is held by conscription bureaus throughout the country. This bill gives the president broad authority to formulate conscription rules. Conscription bureaus rely on these rules to determine their candidates. According to the Department of the Army, the department does not want anyone with family members or engaged in major agricultural and industrial industries to be drafted into the army. College students may be exempted from conscription, and physical fitness should also be considered. Anyone who disagrees with the selection of the local conscription bureau may file a complaint with the appeals bureau established under this bill.

(3) Penalties - Anyone who evades conscription or helps others evade conscription will be sentenced to five years in prison or a fine of $10,000, or both. These crimes will be tried by federal courts.

(4) Term of Service - The term is set at one year, but it may be extended indefinitely when national interests are endangered. All people who have completed one year of active service are reservists. Most of the conscripted people must join the army, and then a small number will join the navy.

(5) Those Who Request Exemption from Military Service Based on Moral Reasons - If these people can prove to the Department of Justice that their unwillingness to serve is based on legitimate religious reasons, they may be exempt from military service. However, the president may still order such people to engage in non-combatant services.

(6) Salary - During the first four months of one year of training, conscripts can receive a salary of US$21 per month. For the following eight months, the salary is US$30 per month, unless they are promoted and receive a higher salary.

(7) Where Conscripts are Stationed - It is stipulated that it is limited to the Western Hemisphere, the United States mainland and US territories, including the Philippines. This provision does not include sending conscripts to Europe.

(8) Job Security - Guarantee that conscripted personnel will still be able to return to work in the future without losing their original jobs.

(9) Debt Security - This bill stipulates that debts such as taxes and insurance premiums owed by conscripts may be postponed until after the training period.

(10) Expenses - According to the Department of the Army's estimate, $100 million is needed each year. Although this bill stipulates that the Department of the Army may use funds, Congress still controls the implementation of the program. The payment of necessary funds must be approved or rejected by Congress.

(11) Volunteering - All people aged 18 to 35 have the opportunity to volunteer and engage in one year of service.

### Soviet Union and Japan Sign Agreement Not to Obstruct Aid to China; Japanese Newspaper Claims Soviet Union Will Convene Four-Nation Conference of Soviet Union, Germany, Italy, and Japan

London - Diplomatic circles here believed last night that it is highly possible that the Soviet Union and Japan will soon sign a non-aggression pact. It is widely believed that Germany has been putting pressure on Moscow to resolve disputes with Tokyo and sign a non-aggression pact with Tokyo similar to the German-Soviet alliance. The new Japanese ambassador to Moscow, Tatekawa, is currently en route to Moscow. It is believed that he will begin negotiations quickly after arriving in Moscow. It is pointed out here that the signing of the Japanese-Soviet non-aggression pact will allow Japan to shift its full attention to its southward program without worrying about its rear. Diplomatic circles here believe that if Japan and the Soviet Union conclude this agreement, it will only be a kind of truce and will not prevent the Soviet Union from continuing to assist the Chongqing National Government in resisting Japan. Well-informed sources here expressed deep skepticism about the alleged Soviet attempt to form a strong Balkan group, including Turkey, Greece, and Yugoslavia, to resist the Axis powers' offensive in the Balkans. However, it is widely believed that the Soviet Union has made it clear to Turkey that if Turkey decides to resist Germany and Italy, the Soviet Union will not interfere. (16th Associated Press Dispatch)

Tokyo - The Hochi Shimbun stated today that certain authoritative sources in Tokyo have received reports that Stalin, after consulting with Molotov and other leaders, has decided to convene a four-nation conference of the Soviet Union, Germany, Italy, and Japan in the Kremlin in order to determine a foreign policy suitable for the new international situation. The newspaper continued that the conference will likely open in early November, after the new Japanese ambassador to the Soviet Union, Lieutenant General Tatekawa, arrives in Moscow. Stalin may attend in person to express the Soviet Union's intentions. It is claimed that this move by the Soviet Union is a rare example in its diplomacy, and Stalin's decision has "thrown Britain into a panic." (16th Associated Press Dispatch)

Tokyo - Japanese newspapers continued to attack the US government and its senior officials today. The Miyako Shimbun especially attacked President Roosevelt's recent speech, saying that the president is only dragging the United States and Japan closer to war. The newspaper said, "The recent remarks and posture of the United States have become increasingly reckless. The steps currently taken by the United States are only bringing it closer to war. The United States should also pay attention to its own actions at this time." The newspaper also said that Japan has taken effective measures to deal with the US embargo on scrap iron. The Soviet Union now has a good opportunity to try to get closer to Japan. The newspaper concluded that most of the Japanese people now advocate improving relations with the Soviet Union.

### Japanese Prime Minister Admits to Economic Impact

Tokyo - Prince Konoe delivered a speech at today's first plenary meeting of the Finance Council, stating sternly that the future international situation is difficult to predict, but it will inevitably have an impact on the Japanese economy.

### Rumor That Governors-General of Taiwan and Korea Will Be Replaced

Tokyo - The Kokumin Shimbun stated today that Prime Minister Konoe's promotion of the New Structure Movement will soon cause Admiral Kobayashi, Governor-General of Taiwan, and General Minami, Governor-General of Korea, to be relieved of their duties. It is claimed that this dismissal order is to strengthen Japan's overseas administration. The two governors-general have been in office since 1936 and have long hoped to retire. Kobayashi has even requested the government to appoint a successor. The newspaper also claimed that Taiwan and Korea are vital to military importance. The former will be appointed by a naval admiral as the successor of the governor-general, and the latter will be appointed by a military general as the governor-general.

### German Newspaper Comments on Soviet-German Relations, Says Friendship is Increasingly Consolidated; German Ambassador to the Soviet Union Returns to Post

Berlin - Regarding Britain's attempt to create tension between Germany and the Soviet Union, the "People's Observer" stated that even if Germany and the Soviet Union had not established an agreement in 1939, they would have done so by now.

### Future Attitude of the Soviet Union Is Related to the Safety of Turkey; Germany Extends its Influence to the Black Sea; The Soviet Union Takes Military Precautions

London - The "Daily Telegraph" editorial stated that Soviet diplomacy in the past twelve months has clearly sought to avoid conflict with Germany, preferring to endure German pressure rather than argue with it. However, Germany's extension of its influence to the Dardanelles Strait directly affects the interests and security of the Soviet Union, which is something the Soviet Union must repeatedly consider. The German-Italian-Japanese alliance is not only aimed at the United States, but also at the Soviet Union, which the Soviet Union has deeply considered. It is believed that the Soviet Union may soon be forced by events to show its hand. Turkey is naturally paying close attention to the Soviet Union's attitude. (October 16, Reuters)

Istanbul - Turkish officials, alarmed by Germany's push into Romania and the Black Sea, are now speculating on who is the next target on the Nazi agenda. Well-informed sources believe that Bulgaria and Greece will be successively swallowed up, and Yugoslavia will therefore become a second Sweden, allowing the Axis powers to arbitrarily dispose of Turkey. It is generally believed that Germany can enter Bulgaria when its preparations are complete, but the situation in Greece is uncertain. If Greece resists, it is believed that Turkey will join in the aid. A reliable Turkish official said, "Our time will undoubtedly come, but probably not in the near future. Another factor that can reassure Turkey's fears is that the Soviet Union will not allow the Axis powers to seize the Dardanelles Strait." (October 16, United Press)

Budapest - The news of a large concentration of Soviet troops on the Romanian border has stirred up the people of the Balkans. Although the Soviet embassy in Romania has repeatedly assured that the Soviet military's actions are only exercises, Southeastern Europe is very tense today. "News from Bucharest says that Soviet troops have stormed into Romania near the mouth of the Danube and have advanced to Serina." According to news arriving here, the Soviet Ambassador to Romania admitted that there are twenty divisions of Soviet troops concentrated on the Romanian border, but declared that this military action is only a routine exercise. It is reported that the concentrated troops include fully armed infantry, as well as motorized and air force units. At the same time, along the coast of Bessarabia, the Soviet Danube Fleet has added four more low-profile ironclad ships. A heavy artillery unit has been established in Reni, twenty miles from Galati. (October 16, International News Service)

The Red Army Strictly Enforces Discipline and Prepares for Contingencies

Moscow - The new military order of the Red Army, published here yesterday, has given absolute power to Soviet military officers to ensure absolute obedience to orders from soldiers, even if it means using force. The military newspaper "Red Star" recently commented on this matter, saying, "The Soviet Union should not forget for a minute that it is currently surrounded by capitalists. The tense international situation has forced us to be ready at any time in a state of general mobilization to deal with contingencies. The Red Army should adopt even stricter discipline than a class-based army. When our officers issue an order, we must immediately carry it out. We should never discuss whether the order itself is appropriate. False notions of freedom should not be tolerated. We must find a way to eliminate them from their roots. Therefore, if a violation of orders occurs, the military officer can resolve it with force without being held responsible. Military officers who cannot resolutely implement the necessary plans will be subject to military law. Those who perform poorly will be severely punished." (October 16, United Press)

German Troops Enter Romania; The Soviet Union Has Not Been Notified

Moscow - TASS recently issued the following communiqué: "The Danish newspaper 'Politiken' recently published a report from its Berlin correspondent stating that 'regarding the dispatch of German troops to Romania, the German side has promptly notified the Soviet government. At the same time, the Kremlin has also been notified of the number and purpose of the German troops sent to Romania.'" TASS has recently been officially authorized to declare that the above report is completely inconsistent with the facts. (October 16, TASS)

German and Italian Training of Romanian Troops is Aimed at Using Them as Tools

London - The "Daily Express" received news that several divisions of German troops have arrived in Durazzo, a key port in Albania on the Adriatic Sea. Another part of two German divisions is currently stationed in the Italian port of Bari, awaiting ships to depart for the Balkans. The news also stated that there are already 20,000 German troops in Bulgaria. (October 16, International News Service)

Clermont-Ferrand, France - "Qingyi Bao" recently published an article discussing the arrival of a German military delegation in the capital of Romania, stating that the main purpose of this move by Germany is to fill the ranks of the Romanian army with German officers or to train the Romanian army according to German military standards, so that the country's army will become a powerful tool in the future and maintain close contact with the German army. From this perspective, a military power is about to appear in the Balkan Peninsula near western Asia. This move in itself is already of great significance, and neighboring countries such as Turkey are particularly concerned. (October 15, Havas)

### German Air Force Night Raids; London Suffers Another Brutal Bombing; More Than 200 Tons of Various Bombs Dropped; Heavy Casualties in a School Due to High-Explosive Bombs

London - London and various provinces of England suffered brutal air raids last night. The number of bombs dropped by German aircraft this time was even greater than before. However, from a military perspective, last night's air raid cannot be said to be extremely brutal. The German side claimed that there were thousands of German aircraft attacking London and that thousands of tons of bombs were dropped. However, according to official sources here, the total number of German aircraft found over the entire England was only about 150, and the number of bombs dropped in London was only about 200 tons. However, the seriousness of the successive air raids should not be underestimated, as the damage caused by the indiscriminate bombing of German aircraft is indeed a very brutal act. Officials also stated that the German aircraft's air raids were so-called "terror bombings," and their main purpose was to attack civilians, as the losses in military equipment were relatively minor. Last night, due to the large number of bombs dropped by German aircraft, civilian property inevitably suffered huge losses, but civilian casualties were lighter than in previous air raids, as people knew to take shelter in basements in time. The large contingent of Nazi aircraft soaring over the English capital last night was far greater than before, and all types of bombs were dropped, such as incendiary bombs, oil bombs, Molotov bread baskets, giant incendiary bombs, time-delayed bombs, and high-explosive bombs. The English anti-aircraft artillery units also concentrated their efforts to fight with the German aircraft. At least 23 German aircraft were shot down. A school was hit by a high-explosive bomb, resulting in heavy casualties. A high-explosive bomb also landed near a public air-raid shelter, injuring one Japanese. Another high-explosive bomb destroyed a portion of a building in an apartment, and the bomb also blew a crater in the street and broke a gas pipe, causing a gas leak and fire. When the bomb exploded horribly, all the glass windows of a church were shattered, and the buildings of a large hotel in London also shook. The windows on both sides of the hotel were also blown away. Last night, the air raids by German aircraft in various provinces of England were also more widespread than before. Various cities in Scotland were severely bombed, and a town in the Midlands was the worst hit. A giant bomb struck a church, and it is feared that there are still several people buried in the rubble of the destroyed church. In addition, two schools and many houses in the town were damaged, but it is believed that the casualties are not very heavy. (October 16, United Press)

Berlin, German Capital - Air Raid Alert

Berlin - Officials announced that there was an air raid alert in Berlin last night at midnight, but no aircraft appeared.

The alert issued in Berlin was only for precautionary purposes. (October 16, Reuters)

London - Today, the Air Ministry announced that on Tuesday night, British aircraft bombed a naval dockyard in northern Germany, transportation lines and oil depots in the west and center, and various ports in the German-occupied Channel. (October 16, Reuters)

### Details of British and Italian Naval Battle in the Central Mediterranean; Two Italian Ships Sunk, One Heavily Damaged; British Ship Ajax Distinguished Itself

London - The British light cruiser "Ajax" (7,000 tons, armed with eight 6-inch guns) sank two Italian destroyers and heavily damaged one last Saturday off the coast of Sicily in the Mediterranean, and severely attacked other Italian ships, including a heavy cruiser, causing them to flee. It is learned that the "Ajax" had previously joined a light cruiser and the heavy cruiser "Exeter" in the Battle of the River Plate against the German warship "Spee" in December of last year, driving the German ship into the port of Montevideo, which eventually scuttled itself. The Admiralty announced that the Commander-in-Chief of the British Fleet in the Mediterranean reported that the "Ajax" had engaged Italian ships, stating that on October 11, the "Ajax" was active in the eastern and central Mediterranean, about eighty miles southeast of Sicily. It encountered three Italian Elroni-class destroyers of 679 tons. The "Ajax" immediately engaged them and quickly sank one of them. Before long, the "Ajax" encountered an Italian heavy cruiser and four destroyers, and once again engaged in battle, damaging one enemy destroyer. The remaining enemy ships fled in the darkness. The British ship "Deuk" rushed to assist, believing that the "Ajax" had been in contact with a large enemy fleet, but did not make contact with the enemy ships that night. At dawn, with the help of aircraft from the Naval Air Force, the damaged enemy ship was detected being towed by another enemy destroyer that had come to its aid. When the "Ajax" arrived, the enemy destroyer that had come to its aid quickly abandoned the damaged enemy ship and sped away to Sicily under the cover of smoke. At this point, it was confirmed that the damaged enemy ship was the "Adraglia" (1,600 tons), the latest class of large destroyers in the Italian fleet. The crew of the ship began to abandon ship when they saw the British ship "Deuk" arriving quickly. The British ship allowed them to abandon ship within half an hour, and then fired to sink the ship. The "Deuk" lowered rafts to help the Italian crew escape and broadcast a wireless message on the Italian radio's commercial frequency, explaining the location of the rescued Italian crew members. Although the British ship revealed its own location at the same time by doing so, it still sent this message. It is learned that when the Italian cruiser "Collioni" (the former flagship of the Italian Navy in the Far East) was sunk on July 19, the British destroyers were bombed by Italian aircraft when they went to rescue its crew, causing the British ships to be unable to continue taking measures to protect the safety of the rescued Italian crew members. This time, although the British ships knew that there were Italian aircraft gathering nearby, they still telegraphed the Italian side the location of the rescued Italian crew members. The "Ajax" suffered several casualties in this battle, and the ship's hull only suffered minor damage above the waterline, which did not affect its combat effectiveness at all. The Italian General Headquarters also acknowledged the loss of two small ships and one large destroyer, but claimed that one British cruiser, or possibly a Poseidon-class cruiser, was also sunk. Afterwards, the British ship was attacked by Italian aircraft for four hours. Although the Italian communiqué stated that one aircraft carrier and one heavy cruiser were hit, in fact, the British ship suffered no damage or casualties, while four enemy aircraft were shot down by British Naval Air Force fighters and anti-aircraft artillery fire. It is possible that other enemy aircraft were also destroyed, and all the British aircraft returned safely.

On the night of October 13, British Naval Air Force aircraft raided the port of Lago in the Italian-owned Dodecanese Islands. Bombs hit barracks, factories, hangars, and gasoline piles, causing fires to burn. All the British aircraft returned safely. British submarines have also been successful in the Mediterranean, bombarding military targets in the port of Savona, sinking an armed merchant ship of 5,000 tons escorted by torpedo boats off Genoa, and sinking an armed merchant ship of 3,000 tons off Vado. Another British submarine sank an enemy supply ship of about 3,000 tons off Naples, and a third British submarine sank an enemy supply ship of 800 tons off Benghazi. On the night of October 12, British aircraft and ships cooperated to bomb enemy troops gathered in Sidi Barrani, which was quite successful. (October 16, Reuters)

### The All-India Congress Party Passively Resists; Gandhi Clarifies Plans

Wardha - The leader of the All-India National Congress, Gandhi, published an article here last night, outlining his plan for individual non-violent resistance, including the statement, "Who knows if I will not be an instrument for promoting peace, not only between Britain and India, but also between all the warring countries in the world." Gandhi explained his reasons for not entering prison, saying that this will be the last non-violent resistance movement he leads, so he has to stay out of prison in order to deal with any contingencies that may arise. The All-India National Congress cannot show malice to Britain, nor can it assist Britain with arms, because of its non-violent beliefs. Gandhi further stated, "I know that India is not of one mind and one heart. Part of India has not forgotten the war and will help Britain fight and learn tactics, so the Congress Party does not want to surround armories or military camps to prevent people from doing what they want to do." (October 16, Reuters)

### Withdrawal of Naval Dependents from Shanghai. US Flagship to Sail to the Philippines Tomorrow. Rumor Suggests Direct Voyage to US, Temporarily Abandoning the East. Two Transport Ships Arrive, to Carry Another Batch.

The flagship Augusta of the US Navy's Asiatic Fleet will depart on the morning of the 18th, carrying naval reservists ordered to enlist in Shanghai and families of senior naval officers to Manila. This marks the first group of American expatriates evacuating from Shanghai. According to reliable sources, after arriving in Manila, the flagship will not return to Shanghai, but will continue sailing to the United States. Whether Rear Admiral Hord, commander of the Asiatic Fleet, will accompany the flagship is uncertain. The flagship Augusta typically cruises the China Sea, visiting Tianjin, other ports in North China, and Manila, but rarely returns from the Far East to the Western Hemisphere. Families, women, and children of other lower-ranking naval officers, as well as naval documents and archives, will leave Shanghai on the transport ships Gold Star and Chaumont. These two ships will arrive here from Manila tomorrow morning at 11:30 AM (yesterday's report that Gold Star came from North China was incorrect).

American Community Holds Meeting to Prepare

A committee formed by the American Community Federation and the American Chamber of Commerce in this city held a meeting at the American Club on Fuzhou Road yesterday at noon to conduct preliminary research on plans for evacuating American expatriates from the city. Details of the meeting were not disclosed, but it is understood that discussions were held on topics such as travel expenses and transportation arrangements for Americans returning to the United States. It is also known that officials and members of the American Chamber of Commerce are making every effort to secure discounted ship tickets for Americans willing to leave Shanghai.

Two More Liners Arriving, also of Significant Tonnage

The US government plans to deploy two giant liners, Manhattan and Washington, to various locations in the Far East to evacuate expatriates. It is reported that the two liners will complete their inspections within the week and then set sail eastward. It is now known that after these two giant liners, the US government has requisitioned two more large mail ships from the Matson Navigation Company, the S.S. Mariposa and S.S. Monterey, to transport expatriates from the Far East. These two mail ships originally operated on the San Francisco-Australia route, via Honolulu, Pago Pago, Suva, Auckland, to Sydney, Australia. They have a displacement of 19,000 tons, a length of 632 feet, a width of 79 feet, and a speed of over 22 knots per hour. Both liners are identical, slightly smaller than the Japanese Empress liners. Internal facilities include grand dining rooms, lounges, gyms, swimming pools, elevators, sun decks, and tennis courts, all lavish and splendid. Passenger capacity for first, second, and third class totals over 700 people, making them leading mail ships on the US-Australia route. The company's Far East agency was previously handled by Chang Hing Company. The import and export procedures for the future expatriate evacuation will be handled by the American President Lines, but the company has not yet received instructions from its head office, so there was no announcement yesterday.

US Liners Scheduled to Stop at Four Ports

According to the highest authorities of the American President Lines in this city yesterday, after the State Department issued a notice advising American expatriates in the Far East to evacuate, the company has received over 3,000 applications for cabin bookings from Americans in Shanghai who wish to leave quickly. Current general opinion suggests that the number of Americans in Shanghai who will leave for their home country may exceed this number. The formal notification of the Matson Navigation Company's mail ships being dispatched to Shanghai to evacuate American expatriates was received yesterday by the US Consulate General in this city, but according to Acting US Consul General Butrick, there is no further news regarding the evacuation. The ports of call for the mail ships used for evacuating expatriates are Yokohama, Kobe, Hong Kong, and Shanghai. Other ports will be added as necessary.

British Expatriates in This City Not Evacuating for Now

Since the American expatriate community in this city has actively begun to evacuate, and because of the recent cooperation between Britain and the United States in the Pacific, there has been much speculation as to whether British expatriates will also evacuate. A reporter from the Dazhong News Agency visited the British Relations Bureau yesterday. According to the bureau, the British authorities have not yet issued any orders for the evacuation of British expatriates, so an evacuation will not be implemented. Furthermore, according to reporter inquiries, the general mood among British expatriates in this city has been somewhat tense since the American expatriates began to evacuate, but the general situation remains calm. Although a small number of British expatriates have volunteered to serve in the military to defend their country, the majority of British expatriates are engaged in commerce as before. Although the situation in the Far East has clearly worsened, few British expatriates have left Shanghai.

Japanese Side Avoids Mentioning the Truth of the Situation

According to people from Tianjin, since the fall of North China, the Japanese have controlled trade in minute detail. Therefore, American and British merchants feel the pain of competition from Japanese goods when trying to sell their own, and because of Japanese control, it is difficult to purchase Chinese local products to bring back home. Therefore, after the US State Department's expatriate evacuation notice arrived in Tianjin and Beijing, American expatriate women and children, as well as merchants from various industries with sluggish business, began preparing and eagerly booked ship passages to Shanghai. Chinese-language newspapers in Tianjin run by the Japanese said that the American military and civilians would soon follow the British precedent of withdrawing troops stationed in China, as a sign of recognizing the "New Order in East Asia." Such self-deception is evident, and it can be imagined how much they are avoiding mentioning the tension between the US and Japan.

### Internal Transfer of Idle Capital Can Yield Substantial Profits: 850 Yuan in Legal Tender Can Buy 1,000 Yuan in Chongqing

It is understood that up to the first half of the 29th year of the Republic (1940), the amount of idle capital transferred from Shanghai banks to the interior has exceeded 250 million yuan, not including the amount transferred by commercial firms and individuals. Banknotes issued in North China and Hankou, which used to circulate in Shanghai, have now flowed into the interior since the three banks were allowed to remit them to the interior at full value. Furthermore, bank deposits have been increasing daily. From the spring of the 27th year of the Republic (1938) to the present, total bank deposits are estimated at 300 million yuan, accounting for over 40% of the total bank deposits in the country. Of these deposits, 70% are demand deposits. The National Government has now decided to offer preferential treatment for the internal transfer of this idle capital as an incentive. According to yesterday's market rates, paying 850 yuan in legal tender in Shanghai would yield 1,000 yuan in legal tender in Chongqing. However, the fees and discounts for internal remittances vary among banks and money shops. It is reported that some commercial firms charge even higher fees, but their creditworthiness is unknown.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Discusses with Japanese Side to Resolve Rice Shortage in the City. Foreign Exchange Rates and Shipping Costs Uncertain. Citizen Food Supply Cannot Excessively Rely on Foreign Rice.

The North-China Daily News reports that several officials from the Shanghai Municipal Council held informal discussions with the Japanese military authorities in Shanghai yesterday (the 15th) in an effort to seek cooperation and resolve the rice shortage in the city. It is reported that Municipal Council officials requested that the Japanese military authorities allow the passage of domestic rice to meet the urgent needs here. The Japanese military authorities stated that they would

Investigate the Matter

in order to decide what action they could take. According to an official from the Municipal Council's Price Investigation Department yesterday afternoon, the amount of domestic rice arriving in Shanghai is far lower than the required amount. The only way to solve the rice problem is to immediately transport large quantities of cheap domestic rice. Since the rice-producing areas are currently under Japanese control, it is hoped that the discussions that began two days ago will yield concrete results, at least allowing some rice to come to Shanghai to meet the needs. He has held several informal talks with a Japanese liaison officer, and this morning he again

Discussed the Rice Situation

with the Japanese liaison officer. The officer stated that the senior Japanese military authorities would consider the matter. Due to uncertain exchange rates, high foreign currency prices, and expensive transportation costs, rice prices are bound to be affected. Therefore, Chinese residents cannot rely too much on foreign rice. The same official mentioned that the exchange rate for legal tender has recently improved, for example, the US dollar fell by one-fifth last month. However, according to reports received, prices have not decreased because there is no price control in the International Settlement. Furthermore,

Foreign Rice Profits

are considerable after the Price Evaluation Committee decided on the profits, which has won the approval of residents, both Chinese and foreign, throughout the city. Yesterday, a citizen suggested that the committee's measures were reasonable, but increasing the extra profit by 5% seems too high. Foreign rice shipped to Shanghai is not sold immediately upon arrival, but is stored in rice warehouses, waiting for prices to rise, sometimes for more than half a year. If these stored rice are also given a 5% profit, based on past purchase prices, the profits would be considerable. At the same time, foreign rice that has recently arrived will also yield considerable profits if given a 5% profit. Therefore, it is hoped that the authorities in both settlements will consider the livelihoods of ordinary people and reduce this extra profit.

### Economic Committee Recommends Recruitment to Replenish Authorized Police Force. With Abnormal Situation, Crimes Occurring Repeatedly, Police Budget Must Be Increased.

The Shanghai Municipal Council Economic Committee's interim report states that the current situation in the city is abnormal, especially in the Western District. The issue of establishing a special police force in the defense zone is still being negotiated between the Council and the relevant parties. In addition, an agreement has been reached for the area north of the Suzhou Creek to establish a new police district, "District E." All of these are matters to which the Committee has paid special attention. The Committee is

Striving to Reduce Expenses

and is doing its best to make contributions. However, in fact, reducing expenses on the police force should be contingent on the restoration of local order. The current organization of various departments of the Police Department is based on the recommendations of former Commissioner E.I.M. Barrett in 1929, which is the so-called "authorized police force." Since then, due to financial reasons, the police force has been reduced year by year to the so-called "budgeted police force." The Committee, in view of the current unstable situation in the settlement and the continuous occurrence of crimes, is making the following

Recommendations to the Council

(1) The foreign divisions one and two and the Indian division should be replenished as soon as possible to reach the number of the "budgeted police force." (2) The number of foreign divisions one and two should be increased by thirty-two and fifteen people respectively, compared to the "budgeted police force," according to the above-mentioned "authorized police force." These vacancies should be filled immediately by recruiting or promoting Chinese officers, with positions at the level of deputy inspector or higher. (3) The Indian division should be increased by sixty-seven people according to the "authorized police force." Low-ranking Chinese officers should also be promoted to fill these vacancies, and efforts should be made to recruit the remaining number.

Maintaining Order

is the main task of the Police Department. However, the cost of maintaining order cannot be low. Therefore, if the Committee's previous recommendations are implemented, the budget must be increased. At the same time, it is believed that all taxpayers, for their own interests, will be happy to shoulder this additional burden. Regarding the merger of the Russian Detachment of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps into the Police Department, the reasons have been detailed in the previous report. The Police Department has now prepared a plan to reorganize the Police Department and submitted it to the Committee. This reorganization plan is intended to be implemented after the Russian Detachment is merged. According to the

Reorganization Plan

the ranks of police officers are to be divided into six types: first class is foreign superintendents, second class is foreign superintendents recruited locally, third class is Chinese superintendents, fourth class is the Russian Detachment, fifth class is the Indian Division, and sixth class is the Chinese Division. If the above plan can be realized, the foreign division will need to prepare personnel with special qualifications, which will hopefully reduce the number of personnel in the future. At the same time, expenses may be saved as a result. However, the Committee cannot estimate at this time to what extent the personnel can be reduced, nor whether "previous positions should be eliminated." The Committee expresses its support for the previous plan and requests that the Council adopt it. However, under the current circumstances, the Committee cannot formulate the detailed steps for its implementation, and it seems that it is not permissible to engage in reorganization too quickly when crimes are occurring one after another and the situation is complicated.

Shipu and Xikou Bombed Again by Japanese Aircraft

Two Japanese aircraft flew swiftly over Shipu at 9:00 AM on the 15th, dropping three bombs, including one incendiary bomb. The aircraft then flew to Xikou and dropped three bombs as well. Dozens of houses were destroyed and two people were injured in the attacks.

### International Relief Committee Concludes, Relief Mission Completed. Relief Committee Held Joint Meeting the Day Before Yesterday. With Sharp Increase in Supplies, Able-bodied Refugees All Dispersed.

The Shanghai International Relief Committee was established during the August 13th Incident (1937) by eight organizations including the Chinese and Foreign Charity Association, the Chinese Red Cross Society, the Charity Organizations United Relief Association, the Catholic Action Society, the Chinese Jisheng Society, the Chinese Buddhist Association, the Shanghai YMCA, and the Red Swastika Society, as well as Chinese and foreign individuals. It has established six large-scale refugee shelters, two refugee hospitals, one street children's care home, and one refugee children's middle school. It has directly and indirectly sheltered, assisted, and repatriated over 100,000 refugees. From

May 1st of this year,

the Committee stopped accepting donations from all sectors of society because most of the refugees had been repatriated or merged into the refugee shelters of the Refugee Relief Association. It also announced the progress of its work and moved its office to the Chinese and Foreign Charity Association at 97 Renji Road on June 1st to handle the closing procedures and publish an annual report to provide credibility. It is now learned that the Committee is scheduled to hold a general membership meeting at the YMCA family room in the Eight Immortals Bridge area at 5:15 PM today, having already sent letters to the representatives of each participating organization and individuals. At that time, the general affairs, relief, and economic departments of the Committee will present their reports and formally announce the conclusion of the Committee's work. Furthermore, after the outbreak of the Shanghai war, refugees from all over

China gathered in the settlements, reaching a peak of hundreds of thousands of people. Later, they were continuously repatriated. Until recently, there were still over

16,000

people being cared for by various shelters of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, the General Charity Association, and the Charity Association Branch. Although the administration is independent, the refugees' supplies are mostly provided by the Refugee Relief Association. The authorities of the Association have found it difficult to manage the increasing donation income due to the recent soaring prices. Previously, the cost of supplies for each refugee was only 1.95 yuan per month, but now it is 10 yuan, a fivefold increase in supply costs. Moreover, continuing to shelter tens of thousands of refugees in the long term and fostering such habits is not a blessing for society. Therefore, at 5:00 PM the day before yesterday, responsible personnel from various charitable organizations were convened to hold a meeting to discuss countermeasures. It is reported that it was decided to repatriate all able-bodied refugees and to encourage refugees to leave the shelters, the repatriation expenses were specially increased by 4 yuan, that is, 22 yuan for adults and 17 yuan for children. As for the remaining thousand or so elderly, weak, disabled, and young people, it was decided to continue caring for them. The detailed methods of repatriation are still being discussed for a decision.

Gong Bida's Funeral Today

Gong Bida, the Chinese deputy superintendent of the French Concession Police, was assassinated by thugs at the entrance of the alleyway of the Ri Hui Li residence on the Jin Shenfu Road (Avenue Dubail) and Xinxin Street. He was sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment, but eventually died of his injuries at 10:30 AM on the 14th. The details have been reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that Gong's funeral will be held today (the 17th) at 3:00 PM. Most of the French police will participate in the funeral, and the Public Concession Police will also send representatives. The coffin will remain temporarily placed in the Shanghai Funeral Home.

### French Tramway Labor Dispute, Zha Peilin to Mediate. Labor and Management Not Far Apart in Opinions.

Regarding the strike of the French tramway workers, negotiations between labor and management have made significant progress in recent days. Former French Municipal Council director, and current Director-General of the Postal Administration, Mr. Zha Peilin, mediated the matter, along with the mediation of the Political Department of the French Police Department, bringing labor and management closer together. According to reports, the most important item for the striking workers, the wage increase, was initially demanded by the labor side to be 11 yuan, and they would not stop until they reached their goal. Now, the workers are no longer insisting on the previous proposal and have reduced it to an 8 yuan wage increase. At the same time, the company authorities have also agreed to increase it by 5.5 yuan. Although this issue has not been fully resolved, the closeness of the conditions can be seen from this. It is expected that after further negotiations, it can be completely resolved and the formal signing date will be within days.

Reported by Western Newspapers, Still in Stalemate

The China Press reports that the French Concession tramway labor dispute is in a stalemate and there is still no change today (the 16th). However, after the strikers held a demonstration yesterday (the 15th), citizens are now worried that the labor dispute will spread to the British tramway and bus companies in the Public Concession within a few days. It is reported that several leaders of the French tramway company strike have tried to incite employees of the two British public transportation companies to strike again, and have threatened them with dire consequences if they do not comply. The French tramway company workers have made demands to the management to resolve the dispute, but there is no apparent progress.

French Liner Arrives in Port Tomorrow, Shanghai-Vietnam Route Resumes, Carrying Over 80,000 Bags of Saigon Rice.

French liners will resume Shanghai-Vietnam services, to be seen in reality tomorrow. The company has increased the number of ships to three, the Loss, Eridan, and Jaros, which were originally cargo ships and previously sailed to various French territories, with the capacity to accommodate large amounts of cargo and passengers. As for the D'Artagnan, it is one of the company's mail ships, which will henceforth operate between Saigon, Haiphong, Shanghai, and Kobe, Japan.

Arriving Tomorrow

the first ship will be the Loss, which will dock at the Shuntai Wharf in Hongkou. The Jaros will arrive in Shanghai on the same afternoon. Both of the above ships are coming to Shanghai from Saigon. According to inquiries made by a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency to the company, the two ships are carrying 7,500 tons of rice loaded in Saigon, approximately 80,000 bags or more. The Loss is scheduled to return directly to Haiphong and Saigon on the 20th, and the Jaros is scheduled to leave Shanghai on the 13th. The Eridan is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 25th and dock at the Washington Wharf, departing for Saigon on the 27th.

The D'Artagnan

mail ship is expected to arrive this month, and will then sail to Kobe, Japan, before coming to Shanghai and sailing to Haiphong and Saigon in French Vietnam. It is reported that the Vietnamese community in this city is scrambling to reserve cabin space on the French liners, and there are also requests to load cargo.

Tsurumi Ken Scheduled to Go to Singapore to Take Office as Japanese Consul-General

Tsurumi Ken, former secretary of the Japanese Embassy and former advisor to the Information Department, is scheduled to take the Haruna Maru liner from Shanghai to Singapore on the 24th of this month to take office as the new Consul-General. Tsurumi's friends are scheduled to host a farewell banquet for Tsurumi at the Cathay Hotel at 5:00 PM on the 22nd of this month.

### General Manager of China General Omnibus Company, Mr. Shaw, Resigns to Join the Military. Mr. Shaw Served in the Air Force During the Last Great War. This Time He Will Work on Mechanical Engineering in Australia.

Mr. Shaw, engineer and general manager of the British-owned China General Omnibus Company, has served for ten years and has recently submitted his resignation in order to join the Royal Australian Air Force. Mr. Shaw's letter of resignation was submitted to the company a long time ago and is expected to be accepted yesterday afternoon. Mr. Shaw will depart Shanghai on the eighth of next month. Members of the Shanghai Club will host a farewell dinner for Mr. Shaw at the club at 17 The Bund today. This is Mr. Shaw's second decision to serve his motherland, as he also served in the Royal Air Force during the Great War. Mr. Shaw is an alert and enthusiastic aviator who has flown several times since 1913. During the last war, he served in both the Royal Flying Corps and the Royal Air Force. When the British aircraft R-34 first flew across the Atlantic, he was the pilot of the aircraft. This time, Mr. Shaw will join the mechanical engineering division of the Royal Air Force, as he is experienced in this field and can easily do the job. Mr. Shaw, during his service with the Omnibus Company, got along very well with the general reporters in this city. This decision to leave Shanghai is something that people feel very reluctant about.

British Volunteers Continuously Departing

The Shanghai Times reports that a total of 30 British and American expatriates in this city have volunteered to join the British army and are scheduled to depart this month. The first group of eight British expatriates and one American expatriate left for Malaya and India on Monday afternoon. The second group of six British expatriates left Shanghai this morning (the 16th), with two going to India and four going to Malaya, to receive preliminary training before formally joining the British Army. There are still about twelve people remaining in Shanghai who will depart for Malaya to join the military in early next week. In addition, 25 people who have volunteered to join the British Air Force will be sent by the government and are scheduled to leave Shanghai early next month, possibly going directly to the UK.

British Troops Withdrawing, Fond of Shanghai

After the former British troops stationed in Shanghai, the Seaforth Highlanders and the East Surrey Regiment, were ordered to withdraw from Shanghai successively from the 23rd of last month, they are now concentrating on tactical exercises in Singapore. According to the Straits Times, the British troops, in addition to concentrating on drills with the British troops withdrawing from Tianjin, often engage in sports activities. In general, the British soldiers feel that their duties were very important during their time in Shanghai. Apart from standing guard, they had very little free time, and their lives were extremely monotonous, especially for the East Surrey Regiment stationed in a "bad area." However, their longing for Shanghai is still very strong. The former commander of the British troops stationed in Shanghai and the regimental commanders of the Staffordshire Regiment are also training their subordinates in Singapore, and their lives are very tense.

### Secondary School Teacher Luo Jiahua Submits Articles Conspiring to Extort, Exposing Inside Story of Poor Children's Relief Center, Colluding with Friend Xue Hequn to Extort, Arrested After Restaurant Negotiation

The Poor Children's Out-of-School Relief Center at No. 519, Edward Road, Pujiang Association was formerly founded by Wang and Gao Xiangsheng and others, under the guise of charity, but in fact engaged in fraud and extortion. Last autumn, it was reported by the authorities of the concession police. As a result, Wang was sentenced to five years in prison, while Gao escaped punishment. Later, the center was taken over by Zhang Guoquan, a local, who assumed the position of director and hired prominent social figures as directors, running forty free schools and

Broadcasting Publicly Daily

Raising Funds Extensively, gaining considerable funds. It is found that in addition to serving as the director of the Poor Children's Out-of-School Relief Center, Zhang Guoquan also serves as the manager of Guangming Leitai and the manager of Dajiang Industrial Company, residing at No. 26, Lane 490, Kangti Road, French Concession. On September 27th and 28th of this year, two articles with the name "Charitable Person" Gao Fei suddenly appeared in a local newspaper, and the content revealed the various malpractices of Zhang Guoquan (also known as Gu Yuan), the director of the relief center. Gao Fei's original name is Luo Jiahua, a native of Wuxi, Jiangsu, 26 years old this year, residing at No. 403, Aiwenyi Road, who received higher education and is currently

Working as a Teacher

At the Huanan Middle School on Nanjing Road. Because the salary is meager, he resorts to submitting articles in his spare time. Due to the lack of materials, he suddenly remembers that he was a colleague with Gao Xiangsheng when he was a soldier in Hangzhou, and Gao had told him all about the Poor Children's Relief and the various illegal acts of Director Zhang Guoquan. Therefore, he immediately adopted it as material for writing and publishing articles. His friend Xue Hequn (also known as Li Min, also known as Li Baibing, a native of Suzhou, working as a debt collector in the insurance department of Lihe Foreign Firm, No. 670 Sichuan Road, residing at No. 5, Lianzhuli, Aiwenyi Road) learned about this and colluded with Luo to use this as a means of extortion. On September 29th, Xue Hequn sent a letter to Zhang Guoquan, roughly saying, "A few friends, including Mr. Gao, have written a draft

To Be Published in Newspapers

According to the author, this draft is somewhat implicit and is closely related to your reputation, and the person who provided the material for this topic is a senior staff member of the Poor Children's Out-of-School Relief Center founded by you. In a few days, more explicit manuscripts will be published, and Higher Education has already cut out the published manuscripts and plans to send them to the directors of your center separately. However, I consider you a enthusiastic person in the charitable world. Once the situation expands, your personal reputation is small, and the charitable cause may be affected as a result. I am currently temporarily dissuading this matter, but you must

Answer Honestly

And must meet in person, I wonder what you think, please reply. Phone 11030, Insurance Department of Lihe Foreign Firm, Xue Hequn, phone time daily from 1 PM to 3 PM." The letter also included the two news articles. After receiving the letter, Zhang initially ignored it, but Xue repeatedly called to request a meeting and personally went to the center on October 7th to meet with Zhang. At that time, Luo Jiahua was standing outside the door. At that time, according to Xue, Zhang was required to pay 2,000 yuan in travel expenses so that the author, Mr. Gao, could return to his hometown, but there was no result. Before leaving, Luo also met with Zhang,

Luo Told Zhang

That this matter was quite serious and should not be ignored. In the past, a certain school principal, Chen, was also exposed by newspapers, and the inside story was revealed, and he fled. The lesson of the past can be learned, etc. Afterwards, Xue and others invited Zhang to meet at the Xinxin Tea House and Jingmei Tea House, and agreed to meet again at the Meihua Restaurant at No. 15, Xieqiao Lane, from 3 to 4 PM on the 15th, but must bring at least 1,000 yuan in cash when coming. Zhang reported the information to the Chengdu Road Police Station and sent Chinese detective Ni Runsheng and Western detective Tuilai to secretly wait. After a while, Xue and Luo indeed came and negotiated with Zhang. Zhang handed over a paper bag (containing 200 yuan in legal tender and a bundle of waste paper, disguised as 1,000 yuan) to them for safekeeping,

And Were Arrested by Detectives

In addition to the paper bag, a receipt for 1,000 yuan, three seals, and a seal of Gao Fei were found on Xue's body, and they were taken to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Special Court. The police station's lawyer, Li Zhishan, filed a lawsuit in accordance with the law and detailed the above situation, requesting a postponement in order to continue the investigation. According to Zhang Guoquan's complaint, when questioning the two defendants, they denied having extorted money by taking advantage of the situation. Judge Zhong ordered Xue and Luo to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the hearing for seven days.

### Trademark Lawsuit for Door Locks, Defendant Acquitted

Xinchang Lock Factory at No. 1, Pi Shao Nai Road, French Concession, was established in 1931. The factory owner, He Peiyuan, produces bronze-style door locks with the trademark "606," which are sold widely. Tongchang Hardware Store at No. 509, Zhejiang Road, has also been managing Xinchang Factory's door locks for many years. Recently, Zhang Renzhong of Xinfeng Hardware Store on Kaizi Er Road claimed that he had registered the "606" trademark for

Bronze Door Locks

In 1939 and obtained a registration certificate, believing that He Peiyuan had counterfeited his trademark, and Sun Wenhao, the owner of Tongchang Hardware Store, was guilty of selling goods knowing that they were counterfeit trademarks. He reported to the Laozha Police Station of the Public Concession. Based on the complaint of the plaintiff, Zhang Renzhong, the police station filed a public prosecution with the Criminal Court of the Special Court against He Peiyuan and Sun Wenhao for the crime of obstructing agriculture, industry, and commerce. The plaintiff, Zhang Renzhong, also commissioned a lawyer to appear in court with a civil lawsuit, requesting that the defendants, He Peiyuan, etc.

Pay Damages

3,000 yuan. The defendants He Peiyuan and Sun Wenhao jointly hired lawyer Li Wenjie to appear in court to defend them, submitting account books to prove that the plaintiff himself had purchased "606" trademark door locks from the defendant in 1937. At the same time, the chairman of the Hardware Parts Industry Association came to court to testify that Xinchang Lock Factory actually used the "606" trademark first, and Xinfeng Hardware Store requested the association to evaluate the "606" trademark door locks later. Li Wenjie argued that according to the principle of

First Actual Use

In trademark law, the first defendant is legally entitled to request a review of the plaintiff's trademark registration, and in fact, there is already evidence that it is by no means a subsequent imitation, and there is a fundamental lack of criminal intent. The brand is still the defendant's old brand, so he requested the court to declare the defendants not guilty. The case was reviewed by Judge Shi Cong yesterday, and the judgment stated that the defendants He Peiyuan and Sun Wenhao were not guilty, and the plaintiff's incidental civil lawsuit was dismissed.

### Gu Tiansheng Cotton Ginning Factory Caught Fire Again Yesterday

Gu Tiansheng Cotton Ginning Factory, a cotton warehouse on the lower level of Suzhou River Bank, North Chengdu Road, caught fire at about 7:30 last night. Suddenly, flames shot out and smoke filled the air. Fortunately, the fire brigade dispatched vehicles to quickly extinguish the fire, preventing it from spreading. It was extinguished in about ten minutes, and the losses were minor. It is reported that the cotton in the warehouse was all deposited by customers and was insured against fire. It is found that the warehouse had a fire once on April 11 of this year, with losses exceeding one million yuan.

### Liu Shaokui Promoted to Assistant Inspector General

Liu Shaokui, the Chinese Chief Detective of the General Inspection Office of the Public Concession Police, joined the Public Concession Police in 1920 and has served for 20 years. He has solved major cases during his tenure and is known for his intelligence, competence, fairness, and integrity, which is highly appreciated by his superiors. On October 1, 1938, he was promoted to his current position, presiding over the affairs of the General Inspection Office and further developing his talents. Mr. Bao Wen, the Director of the Police Department, commended his achievements and specially promoted Liu to Assistant Inspector General, still working in the original office, and issued a letter of appointment with preferential treatment. The announcement was officially made by order yesterday. After being appointed, Liu has officially declared his assumption of office.

### Ying Jipin, Manager of New China Iron Factory, Abducted

Ying Jipin, a native of Ningbo, 41 years old, residing at No. 32, Zhenqingli, Xinzha Road, is currently the manager of New China Iron Factory at No. 60, Lane 895, Xiaoshadu Road.

### Free Foot Disease Ointment

I received a letter from Mr. Gu Qi yesterday, saying that I had a foot disease with many ulcers, and I had been washing and treating it with medicine, but it had not worked.

According to Mr. Chen, he is willing to give away the ointment for free. Patients can go to Shenli Wine and Food Store, No. 190, Edward Road, from 1 to 4 PM every day to get it from Mr. Chen Jinchun, without taking a penny.

### Large Amount of Copper Blocks Stolen, German National Suspected and Arrested, German National Peng Colluded with White, Arrested by Western Police of Public Concession Yesterday

The English-language "Great America Evening News" reported that there was a shocking development in the case of Swiss national White stealing a large amount of copper blocks from the warehouse of the American-owned Ruifeng Transportation Company today (the 16th). German national Peng Te (35 years old) was arrested by the police of the Public Concession at his residence at No. 7, Pike Lane, Hongkou, just after 7:30 this morning for colluding with White. It is reported that the Police Department of the Bureau of Works sent two Western detectives and two Indian detectives to Peng Te's residence, ordered Peng to get up, arrested him, and took him to the Central Police Station. According to Peng's wife, when the police officers carried out the arrest, they did not allow Peng Te to put on clothes and forcibly took him out of his residence, and mistreated him when Peng Te called for help, and then escorted him to the Central Police Station. She immediately took clothes to the police station and handed them to her husband. White said in his apartment in the Broadway Building this morning that the Public Concession police's arrest of Peng Te was a high-handed tactic similar to kidnapping. He has asked a lawyer to visit Mr. Bao Wen, the Police Chief of the Bureau of Works, to ask what crime the police accused Peng Te of, and that the police did not allow him to put on clothes when they escorted Peng Te out, and that the police detained Peng Te in the Central Police Station instead of the Hongkou Police Station, were all "illegal actions." White also admitted that he had not left Shanghai,

### In Memory of Austrian Psychiatrist Professor Wagner-Jauregg (2), The Conqueror of General Paralysis of the Insane, Written by Han Fen, Translated by Xia Chu

So many years ago, when psychoanalysis was still mixed with arbitrary fantasies, he was an opponent of Freud, another psychiatrist in Vienna. He was alert, intelligent, quick-witted, and his words were barbed, often embarrassing his opponents. Some of us still remember that once, when he was routinely inspecting the wards of the hospital, a madwoman was telling her dreams. A group of famous psychoanalysts were listening attentively, and the air seemed very serious, but Professor Hua came to disturb them, and he jokingly asked: "What does your witch dream book say about this?"

He had several disciples who were too ambitious and liked to publish many books, and he often ridiculed this large output of scientific research. One day, we learned that the Nobel Prize had been awarded to our septuagenarian teacher, and the colleagues in the hospital who had a close relationship with him gathered to celebrate. He quickly thanked them with these words: "I believe that some of you will also win the Nobel Prize, and even if you don't win a scientific prize, you can still win a literary prize." A few days later, he was celebrated again, and he tried his best to say that after winning "such a Nobel Prize," it was of great benefit to one's medical skills: "As long as I prescribe it to the patient, even if it is a Chinese medicine, it will work."

The scientific problems that this great researcher was interested in were many, but his greatest achievement was the invention of the "Malaria Inoculation Therapy," which made him famous worldwide and put him on par with the greatest authorities in the medical world.

Wagner-Jauregg's participation in the fight against the syphilis spirochete was completely unexpected. The "White Terror" played tricks on its victims in various ways, and the scientists who fought against it were initially disheartened. Three years after Bordet and Wassermann invented the syphilis transmission test, Ehrlich invented his magic bullet to treat syphilis—606. But 606 was not completely done, and it was not enough to relieve the patient's external pain. There were still tens of millions of people, accounting for 10% of syphilis patients, who, although they had received the 606 therapy, still had syphilis spirochetes hidden in their nervous systems. Nothing could be seen on the outside, but after ten, twenty, or thirty years, these people's old problems would recur, and their whole bodies would be paralyzed. In 1914, bismuth agents. Despite the extensive use of bismuth agents, their cerebrospinal fluid still had a positive Wassermann reaction, which was enough to prove that the spirochetes were still alive, waiting for the chance to deliver the final fatal blow.

"General paralysis is incurable, and within a few years, the patient will completely lose consciousness and die." This was the general opinion about this disease before Wagner-Jauregg's time.

In 1887, Wagner noticed that the condition of several paralyzed patients would improve if they contracted an infectious disease. Wagner was very eccentric and believed in experience more than theory, but now he also delved into ancient books. He read that the semi-legendary and semi-historical Greek Hippocrates had discovered that if epileptics contracted malaria, their epilepsy would be cured suddenly. From the perspective of modern science, these things can only be regarded as mythology. If Wagner wanted to draw scientific conclusions from these observations, he would have to have courage and he would have to have genius to think of how to intentionally imitate this natural experiment. So he proposed that hopeless madmen should be allowed to contract erysipelas or malaria. No one in Europe listened to him, and no one even opposed him.

In 1890, Wagner began to treat several mental patients with erysipelas, and later he used Koch's Tuberculin, which caused a global shock. In 1900, his interest shifted to the treatment of general paralysis, and some of these patients had particularly good reactions to Tuberculin. However, the patients cured by this method often relapsed, and their madness could no longer be stopped by this method. (To be continued tomorrow)

### Charity Basketball Special Honor Tickets to Continue Competitive Purchase This Afternoon; Shanghai-Qingdao Postponement Issue Largely Untrue; West Qingdao Giants Challenge Paramount B Accepted

The final act of the charity basketball challenge, Shanghai-Qingdao versus Paramount, is scheduled for this Saturday. This is the focus of much excitement, and therefore of great concern to the general public. Moreover, the increased value of the tickets and the sale of special honor tickets have made this event an unprecedented record in the Far East. Currently, seat number one has been competitively purchased by an old Mrs. Li and Messrs. Zhu and Zhang. However, no winner was determined yesterday. The competitive bidding will continue this afternoon, from 11:00 AM to 12:30 PM. The telephone numbers are 14121 and 10299. As for the rumored postponement of the Shanghai-Qingdao match, the team has worked hard to ensure that this does not happen. Furthermore, the West Qingdao B team champion, the Giants, after defeating Nanyang the previous week, has also challenged Paramount's B team, and Paramount B has accepted. Therefore, in addition to the main match, there will be two intermissions: a women's demonstration match between Youyou and Jingwu, and a Sino-Western showdown between Paramount B and the Giants.

### Competitive Purchase Situation for Special Ticket Number One

When the competitive purchase of the special honor seat ticket began yesterday, an old Mrs. Li, residing at 10 Hongxing Lane, Beijing Road, first telephoned Mr. Yuan Ludeng, expressing her willingness to purchase the first ticket for 200 yuan. If there were other bidders, she asked Mr. Yuan to send someone to inform her. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Zhu (who wishes to remain anonymous) and Mr. Zhang Chengyi also expressed their willingness to purchase at the same value. However, they did not exceed the stipulated standard price of 200 yuan, presumably due to mistakenly believing each ticket was 200 yuan and not paying attention to the competition. Therefore, the auction will continue today in the hope of enthusiastic participation from all sectors. It is noted that old Mrs. Li is the mother of Mr. Li Hengzhai, the industrial magnate who purchased the ball for 1,100 yuan last week.

### Slight Hiccup with Telephone Numbers

Yesterday, because the telephone numbers were not included in the news reports, the great benefactors who wished to participate in the competitive purchase suffered from a lack of information. Mr. Yuan's residence also received many calls regarding the auction yesterday. However, as the residents were unaware of the details, they turned down all calls. Mr. Yuan expressed his deep apologies to the great benefactors who were unable to get through yesterday and has decided to continue the auction today to avoid any omissions.

### Twelve Celebrities Sign the Tickets

There are a total of ten special honor seat tickets, handwritten by Mr. Yuan. The tickets are made of domestically produced white silk with a red border, and the design is elegant and exquisite. In addition to Mr. Yuan's handwriting, the tickets also feature the signatures of twelve Chinese and foreign celebrities, including Yu Qiaqing, Wen Lanting, Yuan Ludeng, Huang Hanzhi, Guan Jiongzhi, Fang Jiaobo, Xu Jiying, He Dekui, as well as Mr. Philippe, the General Manager of the Municipal Council, Mr. Catstuwe, the Chairman of the Board, and Captain George Little, the British Consul. The occasion is solemn and grand. The leaders and captains of both the Paramount and Shanghai-Qingdao teams will also sign the tickets to commemorate the event.

### Shanghai-Qingdao Postponement Unlikely

Regarding the Shanghai-Qingdao postponement issue, according to the team's coach, Mr. Qian Xucang, the Shanghai-Qingdao team did express a desire to postpone the match due to Chen Xuechong's absence in Hong Kong and Da Mao's and Ren Xiangcheng's illnesses or injuries. However, Ren Xiangcheng's illness in Shanghai has slightly improved. If he does not develop a high fever again today, he should be able to play after a day or two of rest. Da Mao's injury is expected to heal within a day or two. Xuechong went to Hong Kong last Tuesday and is expected to return to Shanghai in a week, so it is possible he will arrive on time. In short, for the sake of charity, winning or losing is not important. Therefore, they are making every effort to ensure that the match is not postponed.

### Yin Qian Cup Table Tennis Tournament, Citibank Forcefully Defeats Zikang

In the Yin Qian Cup Table Tennis Tournament, Jin Cheng faced HSBC at the Yinlian Association's table tennis room the night before last. HSBC has been defeated in every match since its debut. Jin Cheng was unfortunately missing its star player Wang Baokang due to his father's absence, and only played with four players. Although the team was incomplete, the match was quite colorful. Jin Cheng, on the other hand, had an even distribution of talent. As a result, they defeated HSBC 13 to 5. In another match, Citibank and Zikang met at the Siming table tennis room. The former is a strong team in the banking sector, while the latter is the champion in the Qian industry. The two sides were evenly matched, resulting in a very tense match. In the end, Citibank forcefully defeated Zikang 13 to 11, a hard-won victory. Today, there will be a total of five matches. It is expected that the first four matches will be one-sided.

### Cotton Yarn: Hong Kong Stomach is Full; Cotton Cloth Suddenly Drops; Shuangma Falls Back 30 Yuan

The cotton yarn market, which rose sharply and then fell sharply the day before yesterday, turned to a decline yesterday. This is because Hong Kong has been buying goods for several consecutive days, and the amount is very large. It seems that it is now full and needs to be digested before more can be purchased. As a result, some bulls came out one after another, and the market became softer. However, a certain major player is still absorbing, but the price range has entered a high level. Once an unfavorable environment is encountered, the reaction may be drastic. Therefore, the trend in the past two days has been chaotic and inconsistent, and it changes in an instant. It is conceivable that buying long and selling short is unpredictable. Today, 3,590 pieces of cotton yarn are being shipped to Hong Kong.

The opening of the yarn market this morning was still enthusiastic, and the momentum of the bulls did not diminish. The opening price was 1,250 yuan, up 10 yuan. However, because the actual demand from the Guangdong merchants was not strong, the factory orders for Shuangma were sold, and soon the price fell slightly to 1,140 yuan. However, the bulls' pull was extremely strong, and it rose again to 1,246-47 yuan. Back and forth between these 40 yuan and 47 yuan, it took no less than two hours. It is conceivable that the battle between the bulls and bears was fierce. Near 11 o'clock, it was heard that Lan Fengbiao yarn had fallen, and Japanese yarn was also weak. As a result, the overall trend was gone, and the bulls were unable to do anything. The market slowly fell, plunging to 1,218 yuan. The closing price was 1,222 yuan. It is found that the total transaction volume in half a day can be 5,040 bales. The price of 20-count Shuangma fell by 30 yuan. The amount purchased by each merchant is listed as follows:

Fellow merchants 4,800; Hong Kong 240; Total 5,040

### Talk: What Was Heard in the Yarn Market; Let's See What Happens in the Future

Recently, the cotton yarn situation has seen new developments in every market, with new forces joining the ranks and becoming more and more enthusiastic. As a result, the market is crowded with people, like flies gathering on carrion and ants gathering on something sweet. It is conceivable to imagine the excitement and commotion. The author heard two people, A and B, discussing the principles of the yarn market. It is worth recording to inform the readers.

A said: "Certain individuals colluded with stockbrokers, securities firms, and gold merchants to continuously absorb 4,000 to 5,000 bales of 20-count Shuangma factory orders, keeping them closed and not releasing them. The chips on the table suddenly became scarce. Therefore, although the factory sells every day, only dragging in is seen in the market, and more and more is dragged in. The market only sees big, not small."

B said: "Since the establishment of the 'Exchange,' the price of yarn has been rising in a straight line. 42-count has risen by 400 to 500 yuan, 60-count is jumping over 1,000 yuan, and 20-count yarn has also risen by 300 to 400 yuan on average. Although there are major players manipulating the current base, it has entered a high level. If actual sales are sluggish and do not improve, and the goods absorbed by the major players have a reaction, then the situation will be unknown. The factory's profit for manufacturing a bale of yarn is over 200 yuan. After the peak seen the day before yesterday, many parties slightly spit out. 60-count has fallen back by 300 yuan, 42-count has fallen by 100 yuan, and 20-count has fallen by 50 to 60 yuan. Currently, everyone is standing on a snake's back. If the pace is not synchronized, they are afraid of slipping away."

The two brothers were talking with great interest. The author listened from the side, and it was indeed the truth. Whether it can be avoided is another matter. The greatest observation of those who are dragging in all the time is that "China's cotton production can almost be said to be completely unified by the Japanese." In addition, with the storm between Japan and the United States brewing, whether American cotton can be supplied is a problem. Those who do yarn and cotton business generally believe that the opportunity has arrived, as if buying in will immediately make a fortune, compensating for their losses in the past half year and reliving their good old dreams. In fact, it may not be so. Don't think that "cotton yarn" and "white rice" are both "staple food business" and want to make a fortune from everyone. You should know whether it can be realized in the future. Even if it is realized, can you be allowed to make money? Those who have good dreams, think about it on a quiet night! (Shan)

### Cotton Market Remains Firm, Business Between Dealers is Lively

The cotton trade today is not as strong as the previous day, but people's confidence remains firm. The factory's demand is still cold. However, business between dealers is very lively.

In other news, the price of foreign cotton, the New York cotton market, was active again yesterday. First, due to purchases by dealers, and then due to the improvement in Wall Street stock prices and purchases by stock speculators in the market, the closing price was up three to five points compared to the previous day. Indian cotton futures also rose by more than one rupee.

The Shanghai foreign cotton trade has recently become increasingly lively. The factory's demand is very strong. Dealers' confidence continues to be high. Therefore, it is very difficult for factories to purchase cotton. Dealers, in order to alleviate the cotton shortage in Shanghai, have successively ordered goods to be shipped.

### Piece Goods: Yarn and Thread Fall, Cloth Market Also Drops

National Cloth: The cloth market fell back yesterday, but the trend is still stable. This is because the price of raw yarn has fallen sharply, people's confidence is weak, and speculators are selling. Fine cloth and twill fell by 2.5 to 5 cents per piece. Coarse cloth was flat. Colored cloth and colored twill also fell by about 5 cents. Factory prices remained firm, but transactions suddenly became sluggish. Most people adopted a wait-and-see attitude. The total transaction volume on this street was more than 300 pieces. Fujian merchants bought more than 100 pieces of colored cloth and colored twill. Guangdong and Hong Kong merchants bought more than 200 pieces of coarse cloth, twill, and colored cloth. Yantai merchants in the north road imported more than 100 pieces of heavyweight coarse cloth. More than 3,000 pieces of dyed and bleached cloth were purchased from Singapore and other places abroad. Today, 695 pieces of piece goods are being shipped to Hong Kong.

Eastern Cloth: Yesterday, with the continued decline in yarn and thread, general speculators were nervous and sold off, and the market gradually declined. Twelve-pound Longtou fine cloth opened at 37 yuan and 9 cents, and fell to 37 yuan and 1 cent. However, dealers' confidence remained good, and their willingness to buy did not diminish. Therefore, the market turned firm again at the close, at 37 yuan and 4 cents. The price of Sijunzi serge fell to 1 yuan, 1 cent, 3 cents and 7.5 li per yard.

### Woolen Fabrics: Only Women's Overcoats are Selling Well

The woolen fabric trade was lively yesterday. The retail and wholesale sales of each store were quite prosperous. Women's colored woolen fabrics were selling particularly well. Stores selling miscellaneous colored woolen fabrics, such as red, blue, green, purple, yellow, and cyan, were all crowded, regardless of whether they were shiny or matte. Generally, ladies patronized them, and they were overwhelmed with customers. Fashion stores on Section Four of the Malu Road and Avenue Joffre, which also sold qipao materials, also had quite prosperous business. Looking at the woolen fabric stores in the Qipan Street area and the silk, satin, foreign goods, and woolen fabric departments on Nanjing Road, the daily sales of women's colored woolen fabrics have exceeded those of men's colored woolen fabrics. It can also be seen that in today's special environment, women spend money much more readily than men.

### Securities: Domestic Debt Rises and Falls Slightly

The securities market continued to fluctuate yesterday, with prices rising and falling between 5 cents and 1 cent. Both bulls and bears were watching each other. Transactions were reduced, and the dull situation was not easy to break. Transactions on account by various merchants also gradually decreased, because both bulls and bears had no definite confidence and were waiting for the situation to unfold. Yesterday's transactions were unusually low in the morning, and slightly improved in the afternoon. Most were closing transactions. Buyers and sellers were completely different. There was no one who consistently bought or sold. The market was sluggish and people's confidence was flagging. Prices fluctuated between 5 cents and 1 cent throughout the day. In the end, prices were slightly lower by 1 cent to 2-3 cents across the board. The total transaction volume was approximately 500,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.

Stock transactions: 500 shares of Great China Match Company were traded at a price of 23 yuan and 8 cents.

Yesterday, the opening of the public enterprise stock market was good, and prices showed signs of rising. However, various rumors soon arose, and transactions decreased. People's confidence reappeared in fatigue. Given the current uncertain situation, the market is difficult to develop for the time being.

London, 15th (Wednesday): Today, the listed prices of Chinese foreign debt and Far East British companies' stocks remain flat. Only the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's UK-registered shares slightly rebounded, rising 1.5 pounds to a price of 58.5 pounds. Also, Hong Kong-registered shares still stand at 70 pounds, with prices but no transactions. The rest are unchanged.

The British Malayan Rubber Estate, managed by Huitong Foreign Company, will pay an interim dividend of 1 yuan per share on October 29th.

### Finance: Foreign Exchange Sellers More Active

In the foreign exchange market today, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's listing price showed no change. The black market for British and American exchange rates showed signs of loosening. Originally, due to the unfavorable environment and people's loosening confidence, sales were extremely aggressive. The opening was hard, but as news of the conflict between Japan and the United States spread near noon, sellers became more active. Conversely, there were few buyers. The highest price for American exchange reached 5.875 yuan. The market at the close was still calm. In the end, British was loose 0.03125, American was hard 0.0625. The trend of futures was similar to the spot market.

Very Few Buyers

At the beginning of the morning, the price of London large bills, both near and far terms, rose by 0.0625. New York silver prices remained flat. London gold spot prices remained unchanged. The exchange rate of British to American remained unchanged, but it fell by 0.03125 to Shanghai. The exchange rates of American to British and Shanghai were all flat. There was no market for French. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained as before. The bank's opening spot selling prices were 3 pence, 78125 for British gold and 5.78125 yuan for American exchange. Compared with the closing price of the previous day, both British and American exchange rates had no change. After the opening, speculators poured into the market. At the same time, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation also sold. The price was quite loose and hard. It is estimated that China Commercial Bank, Continental Bank, Shanghai Bank, and Yuli Bank bought the November American exchange rate at 5.8125 yuan. The current month was quoted at 5.84375 yuan. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's listing price was not disclosed. The silver equalization tax was announced to increase by 0.25%. Thereafter, China Commercial Bank once spat out the price of British gold at 3 pence, 8125 for the current month to foreign banks. Later, around 11:30, more unfavorable news such as the conflict between Japan and the United States was spread, and speculators continued to sell. The underlying potential grew rapidly. At that time, the foreign bank entered the speculators at 5.875 yuan for the current month's American exchange. Later, the Japanese bank came to pay and the trend slightly turned around. The Japanese bank of the current month, the foreign bank quoted 5.84375 yuan for American exchange. The market at the close was still quiet. It is estimated that British gold was 3 pence, 8125, and American exchange was 5.84375 yuan. The current month was the same as the spot price. November British gold was 3 pence, 796875, and American exchange was 5.8125 yuan. Compared with the spot price of British gold on the previous day, it rose by 0.03125, and the next month was loose 0.06875. The spot and futures prices of American exchange were both hard 0.0625. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.

### Shortage of Chips, Limited Fall in Gold Market

Yesterday's spot gold market resulted in a setback despite the looseness and hardness of the foreign exchange market. However, because the silver supply has been unusually loose recently, those who are long are thinking of collecting cash and generally paying in cash. Moreover, due to the shortage of chips, the shorts are unable to exert their power. Therefore, although the fall is limited, the transaction volume is small and the fluctuations have increased. The situation was still bullish at the beginning of the morning. After fluctuating for a while, it was heard that the exchange market had risen sharply, and the lowest price plummeted to 5,630 yuan. The closing price was pulled up by 10 yuan, to 5,640 yuan, which was 5 yuan less than the previous day. The half-day transaction volume was 2,000 taels. The price of jewelry gold in silver shops was unchanged. Customs gold and other items remained flat.

At the beginning of the morning, the opening price was raised due to the stable confidence of the people. It is estimated that a gold shop entered 10 taels from the securities firm at 5,670 yuan. Later, the gold shop entered 20 taels from the silver shop at 5,680 yuan. At that time, it was heard that the foreign exchange market was loosening, and silver shops and securities firms came to sell off, falling by dozens of yuan. It is estimated that the silver shop paid 20 taels for the cash exchange business at 5,640 yuan. A little later, the silver shop suddenly thought of covering its short position, and a certain household engaged in the cash exchange business also searched for and bought a lot, so the price rebounded. The silver shop paid 20 taels for the cash exchange business, already as high as 5,715 yuan. However, soon the gold shops and others frantically spit out and the price fell again. It is estimated that the gold shop sold 10 taels to the silver shop at 5,650 yuan, and sold 20 taels to the securities firm at 5,685 yuan, and the lowest price was only 5,630 yuan for the silver shop to enter the silver shop. The cash exchange business entered 10 taels from the silver shop at noon, quoted at 5,640 yuan. As a result, it was 5 yuan less than the previous day. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon. The fluctuations in half a day were 85 yuan. The selling price of the cash gold from the cash gold shop was more than 10 yuan higher, and the purchase price was more than 30 yuan lower. The current standard gold was quoted at more than 50 yuan lower than the listed price. Both were rarely done.

The selling price of jewelry gold in silver shops remained unchanged. It is estimated that Datonghang hung up 580 yuan, and the price of Xintonghang was similar to the above price, with the purchase price being about 30 yuan lower.

### Chinese Bank's 100 Yuan Note Already in Circulation on the Market

The 100 yuan note recently issued by the Bank of China has been found in the market. The note was printed by the American Bank Note Company. The patterns on both sides are dark cyan. The name of the Bank of China is at the top of the front, and the portrait of the Founding Father is in an oval on the left corner. The number 100 is listed horizontally in the pattern on the right. Below it are the small characters of August 29th, Republic of China, and the bottom is light green with the words "100 Yuan" in hollow letters. The English name of the bank is on the upper left of the back, and the Arabic numerals are below it. The English word "Hundred Yuan" is listed horizontally at the bottom. The Temple of Heaven is in the oval on the right corner. This note has no place name and is universally used like the Shanghai notes.

### American僑 Return Home, Demand for American Dollar Tickets

In yesterday's foreign currency market, the spot price of gold rose and then returned to flat. Therefore, the prices of British and American gold pounds rose and then returned to flat. There were still few transactions in American dollar tickets. The market price still stood at the original level. American dollar tickets initially experienced strong demand due to a small number of American 僑 returning home. Therefore, the market was still firm. Later, the black market American exchange rate loosened, and the supply from all parties was very strong. The evening market retreated to 16 yuan, 5 jiao, and 8 fen, which was 2 jiao and 2 fen less than the previous day. The Hong Kong ticket fell by 2 fen along with the decline in the exchange rate between Hong Kong and Shanghai. Japanese gold tickets and Korean tickets were still very firm. The former was 1 yuan, 3 jiao, and 7.5 fen, and the latter was 1 yuan, 1 jiao, and 5.5 fen.

### Grains: Foreign Rice Busily Bought; New Jing Rice Flooding In

The opening price of foreign rice yesterday morning was weak, because after the fatigue of the previous day, actual sales were even more sluggish. The industry and hoarders estimated that the total transaction volume before and after this decision reached 250,000 bags, and there were other sporadic purchases and direct shipments. In total, there were at least 300,000 bags. Moreover, another batch of 50,000 bags has been scheduled to arrive the day after tomorrow. Others have also been shipped in batches. Shenji Foreign Company and others were still in contact yesterday for 1,300 tons of No. 2 Saigon (Gong and Miluo). If a decision is reached, it will further increase the supply. Therefore, the spot price of foreign rice was small at the start, and then various hoarders absorbed at the flat price. The mid-market rebounded again, and Hualun Si then traded more than 200 tons. Both near and far terms opened at 75 yuan. Transactions were light in the afternoon, and the market was stable.

The source of new Jingjian and Yaozhong rice continued to flood in yesterday, with no less than 4,000 bags. However, there was a limited amount of Zhongxin Jian. Most of them belonged to Jing goods. Therefore, the Jing market continued to show an imbalance between supply and demand, and continued to fall by about 2 yuan. If Minhang new Jing only opened at 78 yuan per original bag, 75 yuan per hu, and decided to reach 73.5 yuan. Qingjiao Yaozhong was 75 yuan. There was no market for Baige. Foreign Dujian goods were rarely standing still. The original bags all opened at 70 yuan. However, Dujian was 66-67 yuan per hu. Sijing Yetao has also been put on the market, opening at 79 yuan. Breaking the dragon is already an order, with no major entry or exit, similar to the previous market. The current price of glutinous rice, after a period of soaring, has not declined, but the price is not easy to increase, showing a situation of no change.

The source of foreign rice is coming one after another. Huarun Foreign Company's ESSI, represented by China Communications Navigation Company, transported 14,648 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong. It arrived at the port at noon yesterday and docked at the French Concession Observatory Wharf to unload. A large amount of foreign rice will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow, transported directly by French ships from Saigon.

### Damaged Banknotes

— Shen Yun

Although banknotes are printed on tough paper, they are easily damaged through repeated handling. Moreover, during times of war, people often bury banknotes underground or hide them in secret, inconspicuous places to preserve them, which makes them susceptible to mold and fragmentation. Damage can also be caused by insects or fire, resulting in incomplete banknotes. Many people are unaware of the procedures for exchanging such damaged banknotes. As a result, money exchange shops are prevalent on almost every street. Those who hold damaged banknotes are unaware of the exchange procedures and, finding it convenient to exchange them there, reluctantly accept losses. However, the total of these losses can be quite considerable. For example, a family might suffer from the disasters of war, already losing their home and possessions. To then have their remaining assets, "damaged banknotes," further exploited adds to their suffering.

Currently, the Ministry of Finance has established regulations for the exchange of damaged banknotes and has instructed post offices throughout the country to display notices and provide free exchanges to alleviate the people's hardship. However, the public is not yet fully aware of this. Furthermore, Shanghai is a place of refuge for people from all regions, and a large number of these damaged banknotes are concentrated in Shanghai. The issuing banks are located far in the western district of the French Concession, and their exchange locations are often monopolized by apprentices from small money shops and opium dens. Individuals going to exchange banknotes might wait all day and still not be able to exchange them, leaving them no choice but to endure the exploitation of these shops. If this continues without appropriate measures to facilitate the public and eliminate these exchange shops, it would fall short of the banks' mission to serve society. In my humble opinion, each issuing bank has branch offices in important locations in the city. If these branches could also handle the exchange of damaged banknotes, instead of only the main branch, those with damaged banknotes could exchange them nearby, avoiding long journeys. The Ministry of Finance's exchange regulations should also be clearly announced and posted in visible locations so that those coming to exchange banknotes are aware of the procedures. This would not only prevent excessive exploitation by money exchange shops but also avoid verbal disputes when damaged banknotes cannot be exchanged for their full value. According to the banks' rules for exchanging damaged banknotes, the amount to be exchanged, whether full value, half value, or no value, is determined by the degree of damage to the banknote. There are no discounts of 20% or 30% (these are all ways money exchange shops knowingly profit by taking advantage of those unaware of the exchange procedures. They offer 20% or 30% discounts on banknotes that can be exchanged for full value, bargaining for a better price, and fooling those who don't know any better). For instance, someone might take a ten-yuan damaged banknote to the bank for exchange. According to the regulations, the extent of the damage only warrants half the value, but the person may not know the exchange procedures and argue with the bank clerk for seven or eight yuan. This wastes both time and words. If the exchange procedures were clearly announced, such disputes could be avoided. Furthermore, I urge the bank authorities to consider making exceptions for legitimate merchants or impoverished individuals whose banknotes are not intentionally damaged or whose damage is excusable, exchanging them at full or half value. This would not harm the banks but would greatly benefit those seeking the exchange. The Ministry of Finance's regulations for the exchange of damaged banknotes are explained below: (1) If the banknote is torn but more than three-quarters of it remains, it should be exchanged for its full value.

### Flour Remains Firm, Wheat Market Stagnant

Flour: Yesterday, spot transactions were sluggish, but the market remained firm. Second-grade flour from the factory was still quoted at $16.50, and wholesale offers were at $18.50, with no full amounts being sold. The supply of recycled goods on the market has dried up early. Although asking prices are high, there are no formal transactions. Only a small amount of foreign flour is available as a supplement. It is reported that the "Triangle" brand foreign flour handled by Tianjin Xin Sheng Commercial Company was sold for $18.45 to $18.50 per bag through the local office, with 1,000 bags transacted. "High Brand Fortune Longevity" foreign flour was priced at $19.55 to $19.60, with a few transactions also taking place. Amid the difficulties in transporting foreign flour to China due to wartime insurance issues, public sentiment has not eased. However, actual sales have not expanded, so the market remains firm and quiet.

Wheat: Yesterday, the market conditions were quite stagnant, as both domestic and foreign sources were difficult to access. Shanghai's inventory is low, and suppliers are trying to maintain prices. However, Japanese factories, due to the ban on the sale of "Phoenix" flour in the concession areas, have a subdued demand for raw materials, limiting the price to around $21. Chinese factories are offering $25 for purchases, but there is still no stock available.

### Oil Market: Oil Prices Fall Again, Speculators' Ambitions Run High

Yesterday, the Shantou oil market saw another drop of $3-4. Transactions included 50 units of Jiaozhou soybean oil at $77, 300 dan of Dayou Factory soybean oil at $88 and $86, 300 units of Jiaozhou raw oil at $76.50 to $76, and 50 barrels of Qingdao raw oil at $106. The 700 barrels to be delivered in the first half of November have seen many price fluctuations, rising and falling from $106.50, peaking at $107.75, then falling back to $106. The market closed with 300 tins of Jiangbei raw oil trading at $101.50 to $100. Observations suggest that the supply chain for future deliveries is still abundant. Currently, there is a strong demand from the interior, so powerful players are boldly hoarding, waiting for the chance to release evidence of performance and sell at a good price. However, temporarily, inventories are congested, and the trend is inevitably overshadowed by sluggishness.

Yesterday, 2,750 tins of raw oil arrived from Qingdao.

### Coal: Ample Coal Dust Inventory

Besides a batch of white coal dust that arrived last week, the inventory in various warehouses in the city is quite substantial. It is reported that a coal briquette factory in Pudong has a stockpile of over 7,000 tons of "New Hong" dust. Warehouses in the concession areas also hold similar amounts. Therefore, with ample inventory, public sentiment is stable. Yesterday, inter-dealer clearing prices opened at $124 per ton for "Hongji No. 1" dust and $110 for "Cannon" dust, showing no significant change from last week.

### The Sparrow and the Swan

— Zhou Suifu

The sparrow, with mud and grass in its beak, was busily flying back and forth, building its nest, without stopping or resting. Suddenly, it saw a swan standing on a high branch nearby, leisurely as if in deep thought.

The sparrow flew over and curiously asked, "What are you doing standing here?"

The swan turned its head, saw the sparrow, seemed a little disdainful, glanced at it, and remained silent.

The sparrow, simple-minded, couldn't help but ask again, "What are you doing?"

The swan sighed deeply, raised its head, and looked at the sky, saying so depressingly, "How could you know my aspirations!"

The sparrow seemed a little ashamed, blushed, and flew away, continuing to build its nest in a hurry. It had already forgotten what had just happened; it was only concerned with its work; it was happy with its practical work. The sparrow's nest was built, it had a "home," and it received a reward for its practical work. But the swan was still on the high branch, sighing. It had great ambitions, but disdained to do small things; it was waiting for its work to come.

Time passes without stopping, the sparrow is busy working, and the swan is sighing. Is it that the sparrow doesn't understand the swan's ambitions, or is the swan not as good as the sparrow?

### Walking in the Rain

— Liu Yikui

……I can't stand it anymore, I want to jump out of this house! It's not wrong to call this house "a vehicle", it's just like a carriage—a narrow and cramped carriage; stuffy, hot and moldy, suffocating!

Outside is a gloomy scene, as gloomy as a troubled face; however, the raindrops seem to be thinning out again. Perhaps a troubled person also cherishes his hot tears! I decisively jumped out of the door and strode forward into the rain...

The houses seemed even more lonely after being beaten by the rain, each appearing taller and colder. On the street, the rickshaw pullers' strong legs splashed water as they hurried along. Carriages, each resembling a small house, sometimes lined up, gliding by like a moving alleyway.

By the roadside, a man with a broken leg was laboriously crawling. His soaked clothes seemed impervious to the raindrops; or perhaps he was unaware of the rain, which was relentlessly pelting him. Is it that those who suffer, having endured much, no longer fear suffering? Or has the torment of suffering numbed his senses? I do not know. Although I didn't run in the street holding an umbrella, I faced the rain in dry, warm clothes. And I knew: even if the rain soaked them through, my clothes would still be warm and hot due to my body temperature and the resentment in my heart.

But I understood, as I approached the man with the broken leg, his sharp gaze and low cries under his disheveled hair seized my heart and pace. He trembled, raising his hand, smeared with mud and dirty water, and said intermittently:

"...Have pity—I'm a disabled veteran!...His clothes are so cold—it's killing him!...I used to...fight in the war!..." Then came several calls of "Sir! Boss!" uttered in a spasmodic manner. I clearly saw that the wind and rain had battered and wounded this once robust man: and now, he has forgotten the joy of victory over the wind and rain. He has been defeated by another kind of storm!

I opened my wallet and gave him some of the few coins I had. Afterward, I said in a low voice to his back, as if to myself, "This is not an act of compassion for a man with a broken leg, but rather my admiration for a warrior who fought against the wind and rain before his leg was broken!..."

"Have pity on this old soldier!" His cry seemed to still be trembling and echoing, as if I could hear the grief and indignation in his heart: he fought to resist violence, for the survival of everyone! He sacrificed himself! Yet those who rely on their blood to maintain warmth and comfort have now forgotten where that comfort and warmth come from. They mostly rolled their eyes, raised the sound of their leather shoes, spat, and ran away from this suffering man who was corroded by poverty and covered in layers of filth and stench. And he, he lingered alone outside of warmth, comfort, and well-being. In the wind and rain, the rain blurred my glasses, I only realized this when I looked back at the old soldier. I quickly took off my glasses and saw a mass crawling on the ground, turning into an alley.

I let my eyes directly face the raindrops. Although my vision wasn't necessarily clearer this way, my hot eye sockets were cool and comfortable.

I strode on in silence...Suddenly, it seemed like something was rushing towards me. Closer, with a thunderous shout, I quickly dodged this yellow car that seemed like a house. The car sped on.

Who is controlling him to run like cattle and horses? Who is whipping him, making him willingly rush ahead desperately all day long? I felt that his shout just now was not a hateful, imposing threat, but rather like the pitiful cry of a cattle or horse being whipped.

He is not as free as a legless veteran! Although he has legs, and can brave the wind and rain, and can shout for others to avoid him....

But then, I realized; wasn't I just like that rickshaw puller, with the rickshaw to pull, my house is the one I rented myself; the passengers in my rickshaw are more than what he pulls now!....But I was finally able to jump out temporarily, and walk into the wind and rain with the legless veteran.

When will I be able to be a young soldier? I asked myself in the increasing rain.

The rain grew heavier, and cars splashed water on passersby, carrying away the laughter inside.

In the rain, I remembered that someone seemed to have said before: "There will definitely be a clear day after a heavy rain, and that clear day will especially make people feel its warmth, beauty, and brightness."

Therefore, my pace became even stronger.

### Elementary Entomology

— Qian

The length of a flea's thigh is one-twentieth of an inch, but it can jump thirteen inches far and seven and three-quarters inches high. If the distance of a jump is based solely on the length of the hind legs, then the length of our thighs, calculated at three feet, would require us to jump seven hundred feet far and four hundred and fifty feet high.

Each compound eye of an ant is composed of forty to fifty small eyes. Each compound eye of a housefly contains over four thousand small eyes. A butterfly's small eyes number 17,000, while the two compound eyes of a moth or dragonfly each contain 50,000 small eyes. Although most insects have complete visual organs, there are also a few species of insects whose eyes are completely absent.

Humans have four hundred to five hundred muscles in their entire body, but insects have ten to fifteen times more muscles in their entire body than humans.

If a pair of flies begins to reproduce at the beginning of April, and none of their offspring die, and they continue to reproduce until August of the same year, there will be 19,010,000,000,000,000,000,000 flies living in the world. If each fly is sized at one-eighth of a cubic inch, the above number of flies will accumulate on the entire surface of the earth to a height of forty-seven feet.

Hawthorne's Detective Cases

### The Homecoming of the Dance Queen

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter Nine: Astonishing News

I flicked off some ash and silently took a few puffs of my cigarette, unable to help but sigh. I admit that a part of our country's politics has indeed not yet gotten on the right track. Because the spirit of democracy lies in everyone abiding by the law. As an official, every move he makes must not arbitrarily exceed the scope of the law. Director Cui has not had a bad reputation for governance in the past, but this action is obviously illegal. Hawthorne's visit to the director will naturally focus on this point. Although he assured me that I wouldn't clash with the director, I was genuinely worried about him.

I also thought about how Hawthorne told me before he left to talk to Li Zhiban about his son Shouqi. Hawthorne had long placed Shouqi in the circle of suspects, but he lacked factual evidence, only having an idea. Now, according to Anna's explanation of his marital dispute with Liland, his suspicion has naturally suddenly increased. Although Old Mao said that he returned to Suzhou early yesterday morning, this fact has not been proven. He may have pretended to return to Suzhou, but actually hid somewhere, and then went to Liland's house to commit the crime last night in the rain. However, I'm sure that I won't be able to get any results from asking his father, Li Zhiban, about this matter. First, the old man may not know; second, even if he does know, he will definitely not readily tell me about his son's crime.

I threw away my cigarette butt and speculated about the course of the case. Initially, the difficulty we encountered was that, in terms of time, the murderer would not have had enough time to go in and steal the jewelry from Liland after the gunshot. Now, it can be assumed that the real murderer clearly stabbed Liland to death with a knife before the shooting; after stabbing her to death, he took the jewelry out; after that, Zhao Boxiong stood outside the low wall and fired a shot; in this way, the contradiction in time can indeed be resolved. But who is the murderer who stabbed with a knife? Is it really Li Shouqi? Why didn't Liland struggle or call for help when she was stabbed? And there was still leftover wine on the table, as if she was politely entertaining the murderer, which is also incomprehensible. Also, the leather shoes on Old Mao's feet did indeed resemble that footprint. If so, why did he secretly go in? Because according to his confession, he didn't admit to this point. Then, could it be that Old Mao suddenly saw the money and committed the crime?

The hands on my watch were already pointing at three o'clock. I gave up this fruitless speculation, told Shi Gui, and set off for the Wang family's house. Sitting in the rickshaw, I was still hesitant about how to phrase things when I met Li Zhiban. Because I want to investigate Li Shouqi's movements, I have to be careful, so as not to arouse his suspicion. However, this effort of mine was in vain, I composed several steps for conversation, but they were actually useless. (138)

### Impressions of a Peking Opera School

— Dagui

Peking Opera schools are filled with talent and have achieved remarkable results. The most prestigious is undoubtedly the Fuliancheng school in Beiping. After the founding of the Republic, southern opera schools that performed in Shanghai included the "Hangzhou Little Troupe" at the Xiuyuntian Amusement Park (the original site of today's Daxin Street Times Newspaper), which later performed at the Great World. The students were named with the character "Fang," such as Zhang Guifang's laosheng (old male role), Huang Yongfang's wusheng (martial male role), and Li Xiangfang's wudan (martial female role), all of whom were talented members of the troupe. Bi Chunfang, the xiaosheng (young male role) currently with the Lin Opera Troupe at the Grand Theater, was also a star of that troupe at the time. Another was the "Little Dong Troupe" at the Small World in the city, whose students were named with the character "Fu," such as Zhou Fushan and Ni Fuchang's laosheng and Chen Fusheng's qingyi (virtuous female role), who were the backbone of the troupe. Unfortunately, these two schools were relatively small, and the managers were not good at running them, especially the latter, which eventually led to their disintegration and disappearance. Establishing an opera school is inherently difficult. Without sustained human and material resources, it is difficult to achieve satisfactory results. The success of Fuliancheng today is not accidental.

The Shanghai Drama School was established not long ago, and its scale and organization are vastly different from the two aforementioned schools. Its recent performances at the Golden Theater, which ran for four days, were all sold out. The students are named with the character "Zheng." In addition to Peking Opera and Kunqu opera, their daily curriculum includes subjects such as general knowledge, English, arithmetic, society, and Mandarin, making it a well-equipped opera school. The school's drama instructors are mostly renowned figures in the opera world, and the academic instructors are also well-known scholars. Therefore, after opening, it was able to meet drama-loving audiences on the red carpet in the shortest time possible. Wang Zhengkun and Liu Zhengzhong's wusheng and Jing Zhengfei's wenwu chou (civil-military clown role) are the most promising talents. Gu Zhengqiu's shanzi (female role), Guan Zhengming, and Zhou Zhengrong's laosheng are also promising talents if their voices don't change. Moreover, Guan studies the Tan school, and Zhou follows the Liu school. With diligent study, they will undoubtedly stand out. However, the success of a performer cannot rely solely on cultivation and diligence. Stage experience is a crucial factor in success. If there are few opportunities for public performances, the students will gain little stage experience. It is said that the school is considering building its own stage, which would ensure that students can perform regularly without any problems. However, building a stage cannot be done overnight. For the sake of the students' artistic development, it seems impossible to rent from theaters that specialize in long-running and continuous plays. The Golden and New Theaters, which specialize in hiring Peking Opera stars to perform in rotation, may as well make an agreement with them to allow students to perform for a few days in between the departure of the previous batch of stars and the arrival of the next, as was done this time at the Golden Theater. This would both adjust the tastes of the audience and increase the students' stage experience, wouldn't it be a win-win situation? Furthermore, opening up a new venue would allow audiences in the northern district to benefit. I wonder what the school authorities think of this?

The school's public performances have been very well-attended in recent days. Applause and cheers are incessant for every performance. The musicians add embellishments to almost every interlude, making the applause even more enthusiastic. This shows that the instructors have been patiently guiding the students, resulting in this achievement. I believe that the students, who are still young and inexperienced, may misinterpret this external encouragement and become complacent, hindering their artistic progress in terms of the endless pursuit of learning. Therefore, it truly depends on how the instructors use their supervision and encouragement.

### Hollywood Stars' Daily Life

— Shawi

Cesar Romero, this active man, recently suffered from a seasonal illness, with a fever as high as 106 degrees, forcing him to lie quietly in the hospital for a few weeks. But friends of Romero's fans don't need to worry, because he is said to have recovered.

Hollywood romances are constantly emerging. It is said that Cary Grant and Babbette Hoden are now very close, and the two often appear in public places together. Chester Morris and Lila Bache are also inseparable. As for Norma Shearer and George Raft, and James Stewart and Olivia Havilland, the intensity of these two couples is increasing.

We haven't seen Katharine Hepburn's plays for a long time, but she has recently returned (of course, referring to returning to the film city) and immediately took on the lead role in "The Philadelphia Story", and the director of that film, George Cukor, is also the person she worked with when she first appeared on the screen.

Big-eyed star Joan Crawford is now the mother of a child, but the child is not Joan's biological daughter. This lucky girl was originally an orphan. Because Joan's age is increasing year by year, she is very eager for children, so she adopted her as her adopted daughter.

I remember not long ago, Priscilla Lane secretly married Orien Helen, but news came that they recently announced their separation. However, neither of them is willing to announce the reason.

When Jane Wyman learned that she had been assigned the lead role in "Honeymoon for Three", she scratched her head and said: "Well, let me think about it." Because since she married Roland Lee King, everyone has been busy with work and has no opportunity to go on a honeymoon. Now she wants to take this opportunity to have fun, but she is asked to make a play again. So she said that she can only go on a honeymoon after giving birth next January.

### Guohua Starts Filming "Romance of the Western Chamber"

— Haixing

The idea of ​​bringing "Romance of the Western Chamber" to the screen was proposed by the owner of Guolian two years ago, and it was internally decided that Chen Yunshang, Hu Die, and others would co-star, and English dialogues would be added, hoping to enter the international market. Today, Guohua has already started filming this film. Zhang Shankun expressed his agreement to avoid fighting each other, which would lead to both sides being hurt. The main characters of Guohua's film are Zhou Xuan (Hongniang), Bai Yun (Zhang Sheng), Zhou Qi (Huiming), Meng Na (Mrs. Cui), Fenghuang (Huanlang), and Tao You (Qintong). As for the role of Cui Yingying, it has been decided to assign a newcomer to play. In order for Zhou Xuan to showcase her singing voice, there are many interludes in the film, including "Breaking off the Engagement," "Interrogation of Hongniang," "Reunion," and "Changting," with lyrics by Fan Yanqiao and music by Yan Hua. It is said that Liu Zhonghao, the owner of Guohua, is particularly interested in song and dance films, such as "The Three Smiles" and "Daughter of the Sea," and he still intends to make "Romance of the Western Chamber" into a Chinese-style "Xuan Gong Yan Shi" (palace love history).

### Record of Painting Fans

— Xie Huifen

Ms. Chen Xiaocui recently donated paintings to the Women's Literary Association. The number of works received is like a mountain, but Ms. Chen has never been willing to do things carelessly. She dedicates herself to painting all day long, but only produces one piece a day. Xiaocui uses her elegant and outstanding brushwork to depict the posture of wind-blown hair and misty temples. Her paintings contain poetry and are naturally elegant. She occasionally imitates the styles of the Song and Yuan dynasties, and her works are charming to the bone. Yesterday, I also obtained a fan painted with bamboo and a lady, with a short poem inscribed on it. The poem, calligraphy, and painting are all excellent and worth cherishing. It is said that the original limit for donated paintings was fifty pieces, which has now been met, and no more submissions will be accepted. However, Ms. Chen is very interested in painting fans and plans to continue painting one fan a day as a pastime in her boudoir. The remuneration for each fan is ten yuan for a meticulous lady figure and six yuan for an ordinary figure. White fan surfaces are provided as gifts. Those who want to order do not need to send the fan to be painted. The receiving address is still No. 14 Love Ma Yuxian Road. I am also a member of the Women's Literary Association and admire Ms. Chen very much, so I am happy to write about it.
