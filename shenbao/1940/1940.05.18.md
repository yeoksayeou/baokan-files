Fancheng: Chinese forces engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese army in the vicinity of Zao Yang for several days and nights. On the evening of the 16th, they decisively defeated the Japanese, and the remaining Japanese forces fled south in disarray, no longer able to form ranks. After the Chinese army recovered Zao Yang, they proceeded to clear out the remaining Japanese soldiers within the city and continued to relentlessly pursue the fleeing Japanese. Japanese casualties exceeded 7,000. One group fled southeast towards Sui County, while the other group retreated directly south towards Wujia Town. The Chinese army launched surprise attacks from the front and rear, throwing the Japanese into confusion. The Chinese army captured many Japanese guns and cannons along the way, as well as 39 tanks. According to a senior military officer, the Henan-Hubei battle, which began on the first of this month and has lasted for half a month until today, involved a total of over 100,000 Japanese troops. In the end, they could not avoid a complete defeat. (Telegram, 17th)

Fancheng: The Hubei Chinese army fiercely attacked Zao Yang, where the remaining Japanese troops stubbornly defended.

The Japanese are retreating in two directions: towards Suiyangdian (southeast of Zao Yang) and Wujia Town (south of Zao Yang). The Chinese army is currently pursuing the fleeing Japanese in hot pursuit. (Telegram, 17th)

Fancheng: Since the outbreak of the Henan-Hubei border battle between the Japanese and Chinese armies on May 1st, the Chinese army, with a pre-determined plan, lured the entire Japanese army into the expected decisive battle area. First, they engaged in interception, flanking attacks, and rear attacks, then launched a fierce encirclement, defeating the main force of the Japanese army. Immediately afterward, they launched a great pursuit battle. Since the 12th, they have continued to encircle and attack the remaining Japanese troops lingering near Zao Yang, engaging in fierce fighting until the evening of the 16th, and finally completely recovered Zao Yang. The main objective of the Chinese army in this major battle was to thoroughly annihilate the main force of the Japanese army in central China, which has now been successfully achieved. In this major battle, China has achieved unprecedented results. After suffering this greatest defeat, the invading Japanese army has completely lost faith in its fighting ability. In the future, the development of the Chinese army in all aspects will become even greater, and we will advance towards final victory. (Telegram, 17th)

Chongqing: The Eastern Hubei Chinese Army Battlefield Headquarters issued a formal victory report this afternoon, stating that Zao Yang was recovered last night. The initial telegram reported that the Japanese army is currently retreating in disarray towards Sui County in the southeast. It was previously reported that a total of 20,000 Japanese troops were trapped in Zao Yang, so the news of today's recovery is being taken very seriously. The great battle in northern Hubei has now reached its final stage. According to Chinese sources from all walks of life, this battle represents the most ambitious attempt by the Japanese army since the capture of Wuhan. Now that the Japanese army has abandoned Zao Yang, they will be forced to retreat to the point from which they began their offensive at the beginning of this month. (Reuters telegram, 17th)

Chongqing: Chinese officials announced today that the Chinese army, after 48 hours of fierce fighting in northern Hubei, recovered Zao Yang at 7 PM yesterday.

During the battle, the Japanese army in Zao Yang was completely surrounded by the Chinese army. The Japanese army desperately tried to break through the encirclement, but as a result, 7,600 Japanese soldiers were killed. The abandonment of Zao Yang by the Japanese army is enough to indicate that the five-pronged offensive against Tongbai Mountain by the Japanese army, which began two weeks ago, has reached its final stage of collapse. Moreover, as the Japanese army fled, they were killed by the Chinese army along the way. A Chinese government spokesperson also solemnly denied the Japanese claim that General Zhang, who commanded the attack on Zao Yang, had been killed in action. General Zhang is not only safe and sound, but is also pursuing the retreating Japanese army on the east bank of the Han River.

Editorial

### A Lesson for Speculators

Since prices have risen in a straight line, speculation has run rampant, like water striking three thousand li, rising ninety thousand li, with no one knowing where it will end. Even if one explains the advantages and disadvantages, those who speak are earnest, but those who listen are indifferent. How can this be enough to curb their hearts, which are driven by greed. They do not consider that there is no going without return, no wave without breaking, which is the constant truth of the physical world. Recently, the reaction to the high prices in the Shanghai market has suddenly occurred, collapsing by thousands of yuan. Rising and falling more than a dozen times, those who proudly danced in the wind have returned with broken wings, and no one knows how many of them there are. The suddenly rich have become destitute again. Speculation can start a family, just as gambling can establish a career. Although it is said to be a chance encounter, there is no event as unreasonable as this. Currently, the market is showing a state of large declines and small rebounds. Therefore, speculators are again studying future opportunities, thinking of a way to attack and compensate for their losses. The success or failure of the moment is unknown, but the Shanghai market has lost its stability, and there are many changes. The gains and losses of the moment cannot be avoided, but the final victory will never be in the hands of speculative elements.

The speculator's whip is the failure of the speculative enterprise. Since the Shanghai War, prices have only increased and not decreased, which is an unprecedented opportunity for speculators. However, the situation at that time was limited to one corner. Now, the situation in Europe is urgent, and the waves in the Pacific are rising. The changes in the situation are unpredictable. Even a month ago, who would have known that Germany would sweep through Norway and Denmark, and attack the Netherlands and Belgium? And who knows if the situation in the European war will change again in a short time. Speculators are trying to attack the opportunities they speculate on day and night, so they only study the changes in the situation. In fact, the scope of the situation is extremely broad. Those who are in the midst of it only get a glimpse, and it is known that it is futile for outsiders to seek to guess the situation. However, those who still gain something gain it by luck. Therefore, speculators like to talk about fate, not knowing that personal fate cannot correspond to the changing events in the world.

In addition, the tool used for speculation is the issue of the value of legal tender. First, they were confused by the rumors of the Japanese and the Japanese "fifth column", believing that the legal tender would eventually collapse, and they escaped by any means necessary. Recently, they have also rushed to sell foreign exchange and gold in order to easily obtain legal tender. Legal tender is still legal tender, and foreign exchange and gold are still foreign exchange and gold. Why is it that in a moment, the choices are contradictory and the values are reversed, and the ways of avoidance are different and the situation is greatly changed? There is nothing else, but the psychology of speculation creates it! Where speculation turns, it will rise even if it shouldn't; where speculation turns its back, it will fall even if it should rise. From this point of view, it seems that the rise and fall of prices depends entirely on the direction of speculators. How can that be the case? If that were the case, the power of speculators would be unrivaled, and world trade would have no regular path to speak of. Is that so? How could that be so?

Even a thief has a code of conduct, and there are many ways to speculate. For example, to subdue the country without fighting is what Sun Tzu called the supreme strategy. But in the end, it is seen as speculation on the war. If the speculation fails, one cannot but resort to war. This is the war that Japan has waged against China since the Lugouqiao Incident. And what about now? Thinking of including the "joint currency" of North China into the "yen currency system", hoping to absorb China's resources with bare hands, is economic speculation. But now they want to stop but cannot, want to leave but cannot, and are restricting its circulation, which has already announced its failure. After this lesson, the organization of new issuing banks must be deeply considered, and whether it should be linked to the Japanese yen also requires a large amount of capital and must be done with caution.

What is most painful is the daring of unscrupulous merchants to hoard goods. Foreign exchange shrinks in the morning, and prices rise in the evening, like an echo. People have already criticized it as inappropriate. Now, when foreign exchange returns to growth, prices should shrink accordingly. However, not only do they not shrink, but they continue to rise. When asked why, they say, "Why didn't you buy earlier? If you think it's expensive, you don't have to buy it." If you don't have to buy it, then don't buy it. But for those who have to buy it, the price rises with foreign exchange, and it should fall with foreign exchange. Why is it that they do not act in this way and even add to the price? It is not just that their greedy desires are difficult to fill. It is really impossible to understand the reason. The reason why they dare to do this is precisely because the social sanctions are not enough to move the unscrupulous merchants even a hair's breadth; and legal sanctions are too slow to be put into practice!

Although speculation has flourished, it has only recently encountered setbacks in the past few days. But how can this be enough to strip the unscrupulous merchants of their courage. What can be a head-on warning for unscrupulous merchants is that the higher the price, the heavier the cost, the greater the amplitude of rises and falls, and the thicker the power of counterattack. Coupled with the expansion of the European war, the turbulence of the situation, and the broader scope of changes, the risks of speculation are greater. If the tripod breaks its feet and spills the public soup, speculators will have a day to eat the consequences. It is not a curse, but the inevitability of the matter and the inevitability of the trend. Please wait and see what happens next.

Prime Minister Reynaud delivered a broadcast speech tonight, stating, "Germany has decided to make a desperate gamble, first by invading the three free nations, and then by attacking the heart of France, using all its destructive power to pounce on our country's front line. Hitler's intention is probably to achieve victory in two months. He knows that this kind of risky battle will be condemned by the world, but he still disregards everything and does it recklessly. For Britain and France, we have already united under the threat of disaster, and France can especially show the world that we are not just making empty talk, and we never hold empty hope. Our country's soldiers are giving their lives on the battlefield, so all compatriots should also do something and not disappoint the loyal and brave soldiers. Our duty is to ignore all rumors that confuse people, maintain a strong soul, and dismiss all the ridiculous talk that has been spreading recently. The most ridiculous of these is that the government is about to move the capital, but there has never been such a plan. Outsiders say that Germany is using new weapons that we cannot resist, but in fact, our army is fighting extremely gloriously, and our tank corps has proven to be far superior to the enemy's. Some people say that the enemy army has arrived in Reims and Meaux, but in fact, the enemy army has only crossed the Meuse River and created a salient point within our positions. Our troops are working hard to repel it. The people of the country should know that all these rumors only make it easier for Hitler, and they must not be easily believed. A thousand years ago, Germanic nomadic tribes once disturbed Europe, but we French people, who have continued for thirty generations, finally built France. Our country has maintained the glorious traditional spirit. Today, we are becoming stronger and more powerful. From Attila in the fifth century to Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany in the Tenth European War, our country has witnessed the rampant brutality of successive barbarians. Today, the French civilization, which has a history of ten centuries, is again under threat. We have decided to sacrifice everything to win the final victory. Those who cannot understand this will be severely punished. We will maintain Latin and Christian civilization with courage, confidence, and a spirit of enterprise. Long live France!"

### US Announces Cancellation of Dutch Withdrawal Permit

Washington. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau recently announced that the US Treasury Department's general certificate allowing the Dutch government to use its deposits in the US has been canceled at the request of the Dutch Minister to the US. The purpose of this move is to prevent technical disputes that may arise after the German army occupying the Dutch territory sets up a government on its own. It is reported that the government led by Queen Wilhelmina can still withdraw its deposits in the United States, but it must apply to the United States for a separate permit each time.

### The German Army Launched a Full-Scale Offensive Again Yesterday, The Fighting on the Northeastern Border of France Was Particularly Fierce, The Belgian Army Reported a Shift to New Positions, The Allied Forces' Battle Situation Gradually Stabilized

Paris. The German army launched a large-scale offensive to the north of the city of Le Cateau (southwest of Le Quesnoy) in France this morning. At the same time, they also attacked the British and Belgian armies in the area around the cities of Leuven and Mechelen in Belgium. According to the latest news, the war situation last night was roughly as follows: (1) The German positions from the mouth of the Escaut River, which is guarded by the British and Belgian armies, to the Sambre River, are on the left bank of the Sambre River to the south of the Sambre River, forming a salient point. South to the north of Le Cateau in France, it is connected to the Sedan front. Fierce fighting occurred throughout the day yesterday on all sides of this salient point. The other areas were relatively quiet. (2) Due to the German invasion, the Allied Command reorganized all troops on the same day yesterday and cut off the enemy's salient point. However, the German army also reorganized its troops and began to attack again at dawn today. (3) In the Sedan area, the German army launched repeated attacks. The French army, with the help of tank corps and artillery, finally repelled them. The war was extremely fierce. Some villages and forest areas were lost and regained five to seven times. Military personnel here have a good impression of yesterday's front-line battle situation. It is generally believed that the situation was once quite serious after the German army advanced on the Le Cateau side, but after the French army counterattacked, the salient point has been narrowed. Therefore, yesterday's situation was strategically quite satisfactory. (Havas dispatch, 17th)

London. The British General Headquarters issued a communique stating that the British Expeditionary Force has made contact with the enemy and the battle is in progress. The enemy's attack on Leuven has been repelled. In addition, a Reuters correspondent with the British Expeditionary Force reported that the British army fought with the German army with hand grenades at the Leuven railway station yesterday afternoon. Yesterday morning, the German artillery bombarded Leuven fiercely. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)

Brussels. The Belgian General Headquarters issued a battle report at noon today, stating that our army is fighting side by side with the Allied forces and is doing well. Although we have fought hard many times, we have been able to preserve our strength. We have now shifted to new positions. The retreat was orderly and the morale is still very high. (Havas dispatch, 17th)

London. Diplomatic sources here recently stated that, according to recent news, although the military situation on the front line is very tight, the situation today is better than the previous two days. The government is very confident. In addition, in terms of air combat, the quality of aircraft and the skills of pilots in Britain and France have proven to be superior to the enemy. (Havas dispatch, 17th)

Brussels. The Belgian national radio station issued a message at 11:15 this morning, stating that the forts around Liège are still resisting. The enemy's full-scale offensive has been repelled by the Belgian army. (Havas dispatch, 17th)

The German Army Claims Smooth Progress in the Offensive, Breaking Through the French Defense Line for 100 Kilometers

Berlin. The German General Headquarters issued a battle report this afternoon, stating that in the battle between Antwerp and Namur, our army has broken through the Dyle Line south of Wavre and occupied the Namur Fort on the northeastern side of the line. The Maginot Line southeast of Sedan, south of Maubeuge, to Carignan, about 100 kilometers, has been broken through by our army. The French armored car corps engaged in fierce fighting with the German armored car corps west of Dinant and has been defeated by our army. Our army dispatched aircraft to pursue the retreating enemy to the west. In the southeast of Sedan, Colonel Barke, the commander of the motorized assault regiment of our army, led his troops in a brave battle, capturing 12,000 enemy troops, including two generals and a large number of weapons. Along the Saar River on the Maginot Line, reconnaissance activities by both sides are extremely active. French long-range artillery bombarded the undefended city of Rastatt, which had no military targets, yesterday. Our army also retaliated with heavy artillery on Hagenau. In the Netherlands, our army is beginning to occupy the islands of Zeeland. Tholen Island surrendered yesterday. Our air force bombed the enemy's rear transportation lines. Many railway lines and highways in France and Belgium were destroyed. Power plants in both places were also bombed by our planes. Off the coast of the Netherlands and Belgium, one enemy cruiser and one gunboat were sunk by our bombing, and another French destroyer was destroyed. On the Western Front yesterday, the enemy lost a total of 59 aircraft, and our army lost 15 aircraft. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 17th)

Berlin. Fierce fighting between Antwerp and Namur has already begun. The fortress of Wavre south of the Dyle Line has been broken through by the German army, and the Namur fort in the northeastern part of the line has also been occupied by the German army. (Haitong dispatch, 17th)

### British and French Military and Political Leaders Hold Important Meetings, Churchill Arrives in Paris by Plane

Paris. After British Prime Minister Churchill arrived here yesterday, he immediately held important meetings with French Prime Minister Reynaud, General Gamelin, Commander-in-Chief of National Defense, and several government officials. Although this was not a joint meeting of the Supreme Defense Committee of Britain and France, it was extremely important for the current war and future operational plans. Prime Minister Churchill returned to Britain this morning. (Havas dispatch, 17th)

Little Change on the Belgian Front Line, Fierce Fighting Between Dinant and Sedan

London. According to the Dutch Embassy, Prince Bernhard (husband of the Dutch princess) is now serving in the Dutch army fighting in Zeeland. According to news received here, the fierce fighting is still in progress there, especially in the northern part. The battles in Walcheren and Beveland are particularly fierce. On the Belgian side, there is little change in the front line. The most serious part is between Dinant and Sedan. The German army, which broke into the front line in the Sedan area two days ago, has been contained on the eastern side. The situation on the western side is quite serious, but not critical. Although Liège has been isolated, the fortresses seem to be still holding out. Namur has not been lost either. Yesterday afternoon, the German army repeatedly attacked the British, French, and Belgian armies north of Namur. In the Sedan area, the German army's fierce offensive seems to have been blocked. Allied troops have made slight progress along the Meuse River in some locations. In the Vosges area, the German army used heavy artillery to bombard the Maginot Line. The French army in the Rhine region attacked the German positions. In the past 24 hours, air raid alarms have been issued up to 15 times in the Vosges region. According to French telegrams received here, the situation between Namur and Sedan is quite chaotic. The German army is using its advance two days ago to push forward with armored columns, invading the French positions. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)

London. According to front-line news received here, although the German army has suffered huge losses in manpower and materials, it has not made any significant progress in any part of the entire line for another day. According to recent news, although the current situation on the French front line is better than yesterday or Sunday, those responsible in London still attach great importance to it. They have complete faith. The German army in the Leuven area was repelled by the British army and launched a new attack again at dawn today. The Belgian and British armies are now fighting fiercely with it. A French military spokesman in Paris stated today that the fierce battle in Sedan is in progress and has not caused any changes so far. The French side compared the battle of the Meuse River to the battle of Verdun in the last European war, and victory or defeat cannot be determined in a short time. According to a Reuters correspondent from a certain place in Belgium, there has been little change in the British front line in the past 24 hours. The British front line east of Brussels, including Leuven, is obviously still unshaken. As for whether the Allied army will try its best to hold the current front line, or retreat to another position to the west, it depends on the actions of the Allied forces to the south. General Gamelin, Commander-in-Chief of the Allied forces, undoubtedly has a plan to deal with the German breakthrough, but Gamelin is not a reckless person. Although the French army is currently taking certain counter-offensive measures to deal with the German attack with great efficiency, it is generally believed that Gamelin is now carefully selecting the timing for a general counter-offensive. The British army is only a part of the Allied forces on the entire line. Subsequent steps must depend on the results of the current battle in the Sedan area and Gamelin's decision. The German army has overused its mechanized troops in the past few days, and the losses in manpower and materials are undoubtedly significant. According to tank experts, this weapon has various limitations, the most important of which are: (1) It is not easy to find targets with the periscope on the tank during combat; (2) Landmines are extremely effective. In addition, the replenishment of soldiers in armored corps is also extremely difficult. The reason why the German "blitzkrieg" is becoming increasingly slow is probably due to the above reasons. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)

As a Result of Three British Counterattacks, Leuven Station Has Been Recovered

New York. A New York Times correspondent with the British army in Belgium reported that the British army launched three counterattacks and has driven the German army out of Leuven railway station. When a large number of German tanks and aircraft attacked Leuven, they were severely damaged by landmine explosions. The German army first launched a strong attack under a certain bridge, and the British army destroyed the bridge, with debris falling on the German army. The German army then occupied the station, but was eventually driven out after fierce street fighting and three British counterattacks. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)

Ostend. The Belgian government's recent communique stated that enemy outposts have touched our army's positions to the north and northeast of Antwerp. There have been several local infantry attacks further south, which have all been repulsed by the firepower of our army's defensive works. The enemy army is also fiercely attacking the positions held by the Allied forces in central Belgium. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)

The Allied Forces Have Chosen a Location for a Major Battle, With Confidence in Final Victory

London. Today, a special dispatch from Geneva, Switzerland, carried by the newspaper stated that although the Netherlands has surrendered, the Dutch navy will join the Allied navy and fight. The Allies can now control the huge resources of the Dutch colonies. General Gamelin (Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces) has chosen a location for a major battle. Although we are not allowed to predict the outcome, it has given the Allies confidence and a good opportunity to win. The German army's glorious victory on the Somme River in 1918 was a prelude to its destruction. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)

London. The Daily Telegraph reviewed the battle situation and concluded that the general situation favors the Allied forces. The article was titled "Mobile Warfare" and stated that, according to the French Commander-in-Chief, the battle along the Meuse River from Namur to Sedan has the nature of mobile warfare. The fully mechanized armies of both sides, supplemented by a large number of tanks, aircraft, and artillery, are now engaged in the first fair test in the region. Therefore, in the fierce conflict, the result of the offensive and counter-offensive is that it is difficult for the opposing troops to determine their positions. However, the general situation has obviously changed and is in favor of the Allied forces. The outcome of the battle is difficult to determine for the time being. Fate may change again and again. But no matter what the future holds, what we can be sure of is that the German offensive has been contained. This is not what the commander anticipated. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)

Paris. The newspaper "Order" stated, "The great war will soon break out again. The position of our army is now certainly better than on Wednesday. If the enemy army wants to achieve its goal, it must break through our army's flanks, disperse our army, and rush through in a concentrated manner with infantry and mechanized units from the beginning, that is, on the evening of Wednesday. Although the enemy army has acted according to this plan, it has been contained. This is favorable to our side." (Reuters dispatch, 17th)

### On the Western Front, Air Combat is Exceptionally Fierce, The British Air Force Bombs Germany, Several French Towns are Air Raided

French Front Line. According to news from the Allied forces, the struggle for air supremacy on the Western Front was very fierce yesterday, and the number of German aircraft and their airmen lost increased with each battle. According to current estimates, the losses of the German Air Force are ten times the losses of the Allied forces. The most heavily lost German aircraft are the Heinkel aircraft and the Dornier bombers. These bombers, without relying on fighter protection, penetrated deep into French and Belgian airspace to carry out air raids, resulting in heavy losses. In addition, some German bombers, due to the attacks of Allied aircraft, were forced to fly very low over crowded French and Belgian highways, and used bombs and machine guns to bombard and strafe troops and refugees on the road. (United Press dispatch, 17th)

London. The Ministry of Aviation announced that the British Air Force continued to effectively bomb military targets in Germany last night. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)

Paris. The city of Lille in northern France has issued air raid alarms eight times since 7:00 yesterday morning. The local anti-aircraft artillery has opened fire every time. It is reported that several enemy aircraft were shot down yesterday afternoon. In addition, the city of Nantes was also bombed by German planes last night, but there were no casualties. (Havas dispatch, 17th)

### Former President Harding's Ship Sunk by Bombing

London. The liner Verdibrugge (13,860 tons, formerly the American postal ship President Harding, which often went to Shanghai) has been sunk near Ostend. The ship left Belgium on May 14 carrying fourteen British expatriates returning to England, including four infants and one crippled woman. It set sail from Antwerp, but was bombed by German planes shortly after setting sail. All passengers landed safely after the bombing. A total of four people died in the bombing. The 53 crew members arrived in London today. It is reported that the ship was sold by the American Postal Ship Company to a Belgian merchant in February of this year. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)

London. A ship was strafed by a German plane with machine guns off the southeast coast of England today. One crew member died and three were injured. The ship has now returned to port. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)

### Rumor Has It That the German Army is Trying to Use Magnetic Electric Light to Capture the Namur Fort

New York. News from a German radio station relayed here today stated that the German army, which captured the Vimy Ridge fort, has tried to use a magnetic electric light, which is enough to paralyze the enemy's defenders' central nervous system. It is said that this weapon is extremely humane, because the enemy is only temporarily unable to move due to the light. They condemned the Allied forces for still using "old-fashioned warfare methods to achieve small victories with massacres." (United Press dispatch, 17th)

### Paris is Designated a Military Zone

Paris. Although Paris appears calm and peaceful on the surface, the entire city is now designated as a military zone, and the movements of civilians are subject to certain restrictions. Residents who have families and relatives in the provinces have moved out of the city one after another. Belgian vehicles are often seen on the streets, with trucks full of refugees and cars piled with furniture. Children are placed in the cars, while women stand on the running boards. To facilitate the transportation of refugees and troops, the main entrances to the north of Paris have been closed to other vehicles. The police are now busy monitoring bad elements. Civilians are often stopped in stations and streets to check documents proving their identity. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)

### European and American Residents Ordered to Retreat; Gather in Ireland to Await Ships; Not to Be Seen as Preparation for War

Washington: Well-informed sources stated last night that the State Department's advice to American residents in Europe to return to the United States should not be seen as a move to participate in the European war. It is, in fact, clear evidence of America's strict adherence to isolationism. The State Department stated that the U.S. government will dispatch special ships to various ports in Europe to carry back the evacuating American residents. (Reuters, 17th)

Washington: The State Department has advised all American residents in Britain to go to Ireland. The government will consider sending a ship to the west coast of Ireland to transport those residents who voluntarily wish to return to the United States. (Reuters, 17th)

### Some British Officials Moving Offices

London: Well-informed sources here recently stated that some government officials are now moving offices inland, but this should not be overemphasized.

### Roosevelt's Message to Congress; Asks for Appropriations to Strengthen Defense; Needs $1.18 Billion; Aircraft Increased to 50,000; Army and Navy to Be Modernized

Washington: President Roosevelt attended a joint session of the Senate and House of Representatives today, personally presenting a message on national defense, requesting the passage of temporary appropriations of $1,182,000,000 for the procurement of various military armaments and to meet various military needs, so that when American interests are suddenly attacked, the U.S. can respond adequately. The distribution is as follows: (1) Army and Navy expenses totaling $796,000,000, of which $546,000,000 is for Army expenses, and $250,000,000 is for Navy and Marine Corps expenses. (2) $200,000,000 for special national defense measures to be determined by the President, to increase the production of aircraft and anti-aircraft guns, and to train pilots and anti-aircraft gunners. (3) $186,000,000 for various military supplies ordered by the Army. According to custom, the President's message would be read by the speakers of the Senate and House of Representatives or the Democratic party leaders. This time, at the request of Secretary of State Hull, the speakers of the Senate and House of Representatives, and the Democratic party leaders, the President read it himself, which shows its importance. The chambers and galleries were packed today, and members of the diplomatic corps were also present. The President took thirty minutes to read the message, which was interrupted several times by applause. (Havas, 16th)

Washington: The main points of President Roosevelt's message on national defense are as follows: "We are living in dark times. The situation is developing rapidly and is outrageous. Modern offensive warfare has now fully exerted its violence, and the cruel situation could not be worse. New and destructive methods are also becoming more and more intensified. Those who use these methods are reckless and unscrupulous. Therefore, countries around the world must consider various new factors to consider their national defense issues." Modern warfare is extremely rapid and utilizes insiders, the so-called "Fifth Column." Speed and surprise are important factors in combat. Our country has vast and vital interests. In the days of sailing ships, the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans were the barriers of American defense. Now, the situation is very different. "The islands in the South Pacific and the west coast of South America are not far apart. Aggressor countries can use them as military bases, thereby possessing a great advantage. Recently, we have witnessed a certain country being invaded by an enemy country because it was not prepared. This fact can serve as a warning. Our country's army and navy's defense capabilities have been greatly strengthened in recent years, especially the strength of the navy, which is unprecedented in our country's history. At this time, foreign countries may have ordered aircraft from our country or are continuing to purchase them. I now formally request Congress not to adopt any measures that, in any way, could hinder or delay the delivery of our aircraft. I also hope that our country can manufacture at least 50,000 aircraft annually and must prepare an aircraft manufacturing plan so that our country's army and navy can have 50,000 aircraft. I now ask Congress to immediately allocate $796,000,000 for army and navy expenses, of which $546,000,000 is for army expenses and $250,000,000 is for navy and marine corps expenses. I also ask for an allocation of $200,000,000 to increase the production of aircraft and anti-aircraft guns and to train pilots and anti-aircraft gunners. In addition, regarding the various military supplies ordered by the army, please allocate $186,000,000. The above-mentioned expenses and the army and navy expenses stipulated in the regular budget for 1941 do not overlap. It may be necessary to request temporary additional expenses in the future, which are not yet included. At that time, for the sake of national defense needs, we will not hesitate to convene a special session of Congress." In conclusion, he said, "Although I wish that aggression and violence could disappear from the world, I am also determined to strengthen American defense to the point of being invulnerable, so that safety is absolutely guaranteed. Safety is not purely a matter of weapons. When using weapons, our arms must be strong, our eyes must be sharp, and our will must be firm and unyielding. Any nation that wants to defend its way of life and believes in God should take these three as its goal." (Havas, 16th)

### U.S. Senate Naval Affairs Committee Report Released Yesterday; Opposes U.S. Participation in European War; Isolationists Dominate

New York: President Roosevelt's message to Congress requesting a large-scale defense plan has received little criticism. Most of the country's newspapers actively support it. The Senate Naval Affairs Committee report has now been released, with a section stating that the United States must rely on the defense of the Western Hemisphere and acquire new bases in the Caribbean. It also states that the U.S. Navy cannot fight in the Far East. The report also opposes the United States participating in the European war, firstly because the United States lacks preparation, and secondly because the U.S. fleet is at risk of being defeated by submarines and aircraft. Prominent public law scholar Klapp criticized the report, saying that Senator Walsh, the chairman of the committee, is a well-known isolationist, and the committee follows Walsh's views, resulting in these comments. (Reuters, 17th)

New York: The "New York Tribune" yesterday hinted that the United States should declare war on Germany as the "cheapest price" to resolve the European situation. The newspaper's editorial claimed, "The cheapest price to solve Europe..."

However, the Greek side is very worried about the departure of the British fleet from Alexandria. (Haitong, 17th)

### Italy Shows No Signs of Entering the War in the Short Term; Monitoring British and French Naval Movements; Anti-British Movement Still Not Suppressed

Rome: People generally feel today that even if the Italian government has decided to eventually participate in the war, the current state of anxiety may continue for some time. The sailing of the Italian ship "Conte di Savoia" is a sign that Italy will maintain peace for at least two weeks, because most Italians believe that Italy will not immediately participate in the war and risk the ship being captured in the Atlantic. At the same time, Italian newspapers continue to fully support Germany, but the public's anxiety about the current war is clearly increasing daily. (Reuters, 17th)

Rome: The joint British and French fleet, which left Alexandria two weeks ago, is now conducting naval exercises off the coast of Egypt. The flashes of gunfire are clearly visible in Alexandria.

(Havas, 17th)

### British Minister of Information Advises Citizens Not to Be Misled by Rumors

London: Minister of Information Cooper gave a broadcast speech last night, saying that he felt that the duty of the Information Department was to provide the people with as much information as possible in the shortest possible time. Accuracy and speed were its two main goals, with accuracy being the first. The people should not be too worried about the urgency of the war and should not easily believe rumors, which would only create trouble. It should be known that the great war we are now engaged in will last a long time and will be very fierce. Unfavorable times and unfavorable news are inevitable. Homer said three thousand years ago that rumors were the fastest way to spread evil. This is still the case today. Germany has recently told its people that the British King is now packing his bags and will soon take refuge in Canada. This kind of rumor is not worth laughing at, but other rumors, which are less absurd, are enough to make timid people tremble. Unfavorable news in war is like enemy bullets flying on the front line. We should be prepared to accept it at that time. All citizens should now use all their energy in their work. We should rally our spirits and firmly believe that we will eventually win, because in our long and glorious history, we have never encountered failure in major wars. (Reuters, 17th)

### No Threat Felt at the Border; Swiss Situation Relaxed; Good Relations with Italy Are a Favorable Factor; Eliminating Internal Spies Considered a Top Priority

蘇列克 (Should be Zurich): According to general opinion, the situation in Switzerland is now more relaxed than at any time since Germany began invading the Netherlands and Belgium. According to a senior Swiss authority, those responsible believe that Germany may not take action against Switzerland soon, and political figures also emphasize that the good relations between Italy and Switzerland are a favorable factor. Some German troops along the Swiss border have been withdrawn or transferred to the Western Front. It is heard that one reason why many German troops were stationed on the Swiss border was that the peaceful border area would not be bombed, and when the troops were needed, they could be transferred to the Western Front without using the railways in the Rhine region, which were repeatedly attacked by the British Air Force. (Reuters, 17th)

London: Political figures here recently stated that the rumor that Germany had concentrated troops near the Swiss border has gradually been confirmed. According to reliable sources, Germany has concentrated as many as twenty-five divisions between the Black Forest and Lake Constance, and has concentrated a large number of troops in the Vorarlberg region of Austria. Well-informed sources stated that if German troops invade Switzerland, the 500,000 Swiss troops will definitely provide strong resistance to the aggressors. However, some troops must still be stationed on the Italian border to prevent that country from taking action. However, the Swiss are optimistic about their national defense and say that German troops would encounter difficulties in the Winterthur area if they invaded. It would also not be easy for Italy to pass through the Simplon and St. Gotthard mountain passes. If Italy takes action, Switzerland will ask France for help, and French troops can then enter Switzerland's Valais Canton along the Rhone River to provide assistance. However, the possibility of a German attack is greater than that of Italy. For this reason, the Swiss military authorities have taken various measures and have also tried to eliminate the German "Fifth Column" (internal spies) to prevent guerrilla warfare from breaking out in the country after the war breaks out. Switzerland is a small country, and the mobilization of troops and the concentration of military equipment cannot be kept completely secret. It is feared that German spies have already reported various military intelligence to their government. It is easy for Switzerland and France to implement military cooperation, because Swiss General Staff officers have studied military science in Paris since 1919. (Havas, 16th)

### League of Nations Secretariat Reduces Staff; Temporarily Stays in Geneva

Geneva: Most of the staff of the League of Nations Secretariat have been dismissed, many contracts have been suspended, and only fifty people are still employed in Geneva. If there is an emergency, they will leave Switzerland. The International Labour Office has also taken the same precautionary measures. (Reuters, 17th)

### Relations Between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia Become Increasingly Cordial; Agreement Established to Enhance Economic Relations; Attracts Great Attention from Central European Countries

Moscow: Yugoslav economic delegate Gjorgjević recently sent a telegram from the Soviet-Yugoslav border town of Vintsdyelaspol to Soviet Foreign Trade Committee Chairman Mikoyan, expressing satisfaction with the signing of the Soviet-Yugoslav trade agreement and saying that he firmly believes that Soviet-Yugoslav economic cooperation will consolidate the friendship between the two countries and increase the well-being of the two peoples. Mikoyan immediately sent a reply of thanks. (TASS, 17th)

London: A special dispatch here stated that the "Times" recently published an article titled "Balkan Understanding," saying that the Yugoslav trade delegation, which went to Moscow last month, has signed three treaties with the Soviet Union regarding commerce, etc. This matter has attracted great attention from Italy and the Balkan countries, all of which believe that it is an indication that Yugoslavia intends to restore diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, which may be the ultimate goal of the Yugoslav government. Although Bulgaria and the Soviet Union signed a trade agreement in January, trade between the two countries has not yet reached an important level. Therefore, it is difficult to say whether trade between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia will have a more satisfactory development at present. What is noteworthy is that this matter has caused concern among German diplomatic envoys stationed in Yugoslavia. Non-Slavic countries in the Balkans have expressed some doubts about the possibility of a Soviet-Yugoslav understanding, because the people of Greece, Romania, and Turkey still have clear memories of the former Tsarist Russia serving as the formal protector of the Serbian and Bulgarian peoples. According to far-sighted Turkish figures, any attempt to organize a Slavic bloc under Soviet protection will undermine Balkan cooperation regardless of race, or even give foreign countries an excuse to intervene, causing the Balkan people to suffer the disasters that their leaders are trying to avoid. However, this danger may not be imminent. The Soviet Union's policy toward the regions concerned by Germany seems to have slowed down slightly compared to a few months ago. (Reuters, 17th)

### Anti-Soviet Group Established in Mexico

Mexico City: A national workers' anti-communist group has recently been established here, claiming that Soviet special envoys and Spanish refugees in Mexico have recently formed a "Fifth Column" clique to threaten the Mexican system. A nationwide anti-Soviet movement is now underway in Mexico. (United Press, 17th)

### Soviet-Swedish Trade Negotiations

Moscow: Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov met with the Swedish economic delegation yesterday for talks. (TASS, 16th)

### German Bomber Intrudes into Swiss Airspace; Shot Down, Three Crew Members Detained

London: Swiss Radio broadcast a message from the Swiss General Staff saying that a German 德制 (German-made) 與克爾式 (and a Keer-type) bomber was shot down near the Swiss Flurlingen airport by Swiss fighter planes. Three members of the German crew have been detained, but two others are at large. (Reuters, 17th)

### British Embassy Denies Activities in Neutral Countries; Warns British Nationals Not to Lightly Believe Rumors; Encourages Nationals in the Netherlands to Continue Fighting

The British Embassy yesterday issued a warning, notifying British nationals in Shanghai not to lightly believe rumors circulating that British forces were active in neutral countries. It claimed that the British side had discovered people spreading rumors to strain relations between Britain and third countries. For example, it was recently claimed that British troops had landed in the Dutch East Indies, which was completely unfounded.

British Military Refutes German Propaganda

The British naval authorities in Shanghai issued a statement yesterday, saying that the German side announced on the 14th of this month that they had sunk one British cruiser and one destroyer, and that one gasoline boat of 2,500 tons and one of 8,000 tons had also been severely damaged. It also claimed that since March 16, the German side had sunk and severely damaged more than 60 British ships. All of the above are completely inaccurate reports.

Far East Italian Ships Operate as Usual

The tense situation in the Mediterranean and the movements of Italian ships in Shanghai have attracted considerable attention. If Italy joins the war, British and French ships can still go around the Cape of Good Hope, but Italian ships will have to stop completely. Currently, the Italian Shipping Company at No. 26 the Bund in Shanghai is still operating as usual, and ships such as the Conte Rosso and Conte Verde are still sailing on the Shanghai-Europe route.

Chinese and Foreigners Donate to Aid Belgium

Baroness Guillaume, wife of the Belgian ambassador to China, issued an urgent appeal to Belgian friends in Shanghai on the evening of the 14th, applying for donations to aid the Belgian Red Cross for the use of wounded soldiers and refugees. People from all walks of life in the city sympathized with the situation in Belgium, and Chinese and foreigners responded enthusiastically with donations. French Ambassador to China Cosme donated 500 French francs. Baron Guillaume also donated 25,000 Belgian francs. Chinese people also donated enthusiastically. Two ladies, Dong and Huang, each made donations. As of yesterday morning, the total amount received was 59,786 French francs, 121,850 Belgian francs, 235 US dollars, 5 British pounds, and 500 French francs.

Javanese Currency Linked to US Dollar

Since the German invasion of the Netherlands and the surrender of the Dutch commander, the issue of Dutch currency has become a concern for all sectors of society, especially merchants in Shanghai. Since the European war spread to the Netherlands, there has been no market for the exchange rate of Dutch currency against the Chinese, British, and American currencies. According to the "Ping Ming News Agency" reporter's inquiry to authoritative sources at foreign banks in Shanghai, before the European war expanded to the Netherlands and Belgium, the black market exchange rate of Dutch currency against the Chinese currency was 9 guilders per 100 French francs. This Dutch guilder still has no market price, as most of the Netherlands is in the hands of the German army, and the cash that the Netherlands has in the United States has been ordered by the US government to be prohibited from withdrawal. However, President Roosevelt yesterday specially approved the normal withdrawal of deposits in Java, the largest Dutch colony. Therefore, the Dutch domestic currency and the Javanese colonial currency have in fact broken their connection and will go their separate ways in the future. According to unconfirmed news obtained by foreign banking circles, the currency of Java, a Dutch colony, will soon be linked to the US dollar, with an exchange rate of approximately 45 US cents per Javanese Dutch guilder. Although the above news has not been officially announced by the Dutch government, foreign bankers here believe that it is absolutely possible, because Java's foreign trade exports are more than imports, so the Javanese Dutch guilder is higher than the Dutch domestic guilder.

Java Ships Have Not Stopped

Since the German army invaded the Netherlands and Belgium, and the Dutch commander ordered a ceasefire, the question of whether there would be any changes to the routes of the Java Shipping Company in Shanghai has attracted much attention. A reporter visited the company yesterday and was told that no telegrams had been received to date, and the company's ships were operating as usual. The "Tjisaroea" arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday and departed for Surabaya today. The "Tjinegara" is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 21st and depart for Surabaya on the 23rd. However, the Dutch ships on the Europe route have been temporarily suspended due to the severity of the situation in the Mediterranean and the rapidly changing European war.

Many Overseas Chinese from Southeast Asia Arrive in Shanghai

The Dutch Java Shipping Company's ship "Tjisaroea" arrived in Shanghai on the 16th, carrying more than 350 overseas Chinese living in the Philippines and Java. According to overseas Chinese from Java, when they left Dutch-owned areas in Southeast Asia, the Dutch war had not yet broken out, so everything was as it was in the past. When the ship arrived in Xiamen, it suddenly received a telegram about the German invasion of the Netherlands. The crew and passengers were shocked. The "Tjisaroea" was ordered to return to Hong Kong, stayed there for two days, and then set sail for Shanghai. The speed of the ship increased by one-third on the way to Shanghai to prevent accidents.

Excellent Opportunity for Exporting Domestic Goods

The European war has expanded, and the participating countries are preparing for war, conscripting troops, and converting daily necessities into military supplies. All the large quantities of goods that the people need every day rely on imports from abroad. A reporter from the "New Sound News Agency," wanting to clarify the relationship between the domestic goods industry in Shanghai and the European war, visited Mei Guanwu, a leader in the domestic goods industry in Shanghai, yesterday. According to Mei, he had previously gone to various territories in Southeast Asia to investigate the sales of domestic goods. There are many overseas Chinese in the area, all of whom have huge amounts of capital, and many invest in domestic and foreign industry and commerce. They also do not lag behind in loving domestic goods. Therefore, the annual shipments of domestic goods to various territories in Southeast Asia are indeed not uncommon. Now, the expansion of the European war is indeed a good opportunity for domestic goods to compete in foreign markets. Therefore, domestic goods factories in Shanghai have increased production and are working day and night, shipping their products to Europe to compete for sales. Although the source of raw materials for these factories has been slightly affected, it will not hinder the products. Because of the careful research of the Chinese people, most of the domestic raw materials can be substituted, and the price is low, so the cost is reduced. In recent days, the domestic goods shipped to Europe are mainly knitted goods, cotton fabrics, and towels. Orders for large quantities of necessities are sent from foreign countries to Shanghai every day, and the domestic goods factories are really unable to meet the demand.

### Dutch Reiterate Determination to Resist

According to reliable foreign sources, the Dutch government, in order to express its determination to continue resisting Germany, recently telegraphed its diplomatic representatives in China, forwarding it to the Chongqing National Government, stating: "The Queen and the government of the Netherlands are now temporarily stationed in London. Although most of the Netherlands has ceased resistance to Germany, the Netherlands and Germany are still at war. Therefore, the navy and other troops outside the Netherlands will continue to fight Germany to the end."

Dutch Consul General Broadcasts Last Night

Yesterday was Norway's National Day. The French, Dutch, Norwegian, and Belgian consuls general stationed in Shanghai gave a joint broadcast speech at the French Radio Station at 9:30 last night, clarifying the united attitude of the Allied Powers. Dutch Consul General Baisse Van addressed the Dutch overseas Chinese, saying: "Fellow countrymen, taking the opportunity of Norway's National Day and the Allied joint broadcast, I would like to briefly talk to you about the current situation in our country. On May 10, the enemy suddenly invaded our country without warning, bringing the latest weapons and tactics. Our army resisted as much as possible at all key points and retreated when exhausted. The enemy then threatened our supreme military commander with the massacre of unarmed civilians, inducing him to surrender. We hereby express our deepest respect to the people who sacrificed their lives for the ideal of the motherland and the righteous cause of freedom. At the same time, we are infinitely concerned about the fate of our compatriots far away in our motherland and the encounters of our friendly country Belgium. At this critical moment, we must examine ourselves and strengthen our determination, and recall the history of our motherland and the lessons given to us by the martyrs. We must not forget that after defeating the Spanish invaders, our motherland enjoyed the greatest and most brilliant era in the golden age of the seventeenth century. The national strength of the Netherlands is cultivated by the peaceful development of prosperity and human happiness. Our motherland will now devote all its national strength to serving the struggle for justice and human dignity. We have no need to be disappointed, we continue to fight for the future, and we firmly believe that justice and freedom will never be obliterated, and will surely win the final victory. We have not lost our honor and faith, and we absolutely sympathize with and loyally support our royal family and Her Majesty the Queen."

### Shanghai West "Special Police Bureau" Rumored to be Established

According to the news agency, the "Special District Police Station" in Shanghai West has recently made progress. Detailed measures have generally been decided, and there is hope for its establishment at the end of this month.

### Yongyao Ship Detained by People in Haimen

Ordered to Load Rice and Grain to Aid Ningbo, Local People Did Not Allow It

According to shipping industry news, the German company Far East Company's ship "Yongyao" was ordered by the Ningbo authorities to sail to Haimen, which is under the jurisdiction of Taiwan, to load rice and grain in order to transport it to Ningbo to help the local food supply. It was originally planned to load 500 stones of Taiwanese rice, but the people of Haimen feared that this would affect the local food supply, so they stopped it and did not allow it to leave the port. Therefore, the ship is still in Haimen, and various parties are mediating.

### American University Association Held a Luncheon Yesterday; Admiral Hepner Delivered an Excellent Speech at the Meeting; American Cruiser from the Philippines to Sail to Shanghai at the End of the Month

The American University Association in Shanghai held a monthly luncheon at the American Club on Fuzhou Road yesterday afternoon, inviting Admiral Hepner, commander of the US Asiatic Fleet, as the guest of honor, and giving a speech on the subject of the US Naval Academy, which was very interesting. Finally, the chairman and other officers were elected and the meeting adjourned.

Many Attendees

The American University Association holds a monthly luncheon to connect feelings. Yesterday was also a regular meeting. The venue was set up in the hall of the American Club. Many students from various American universities in Shanghai and invited Chinese and Western guests attended. The interior was decorated neatly, and the meals and fruits were arranged in an "E" shape. The school badges of various American universities were hung on the four walls, which were dazzling. The attendees treated this as a reunion of old friends, which was indeed touching.

General Information on the Naval Academy

Among the flags of various schools, there was a horizontal banner with the words "USNA" on it, which was the abbreviation for the US Naval Academy. The guest of honor, Admiral Hepner, had served as superintendent of the school for several years. There were several people wearing military uniforms at the meeting, all of whom were students of the Naval Academy and were serving in the Asiatic Fleet. Admiral Hepner was wearing a military uniform, dignified and majestic, with the demeanor of a veteran. Although his speech was quite concise, it was well-organized, fascinating, and provided a general description of the shortcomings and advantages of his experience in the military school. His words were clear and easy to understand, and the audience enjoyed it.

Election of Officers

During the meal, the association also reported the results of the election of officers. Mr. Putlich, Acting Consul General of the United States in Shanghai, was elected as Chairman, Yan Deqing as Vice-Chairman, Mr. Wei as Secretary, and Mr. Smith as Treasurer.

Movements of American Ships

According to the Continental Daily News, the US Navy cruiser "Augusta," which is currently docked in the Huangpu River on the Bund, is said to be sailing to various ports in North China starting next Thursday, and will arrive in Shanghai on the 29th of this month. It is also rumored that six submarines from the US Pacific Fleet will sail from Manila to Shanghai in mid-July, but this statement has not been confirmed.

### Labor Dispute at the Public Works Department Resolved; All Workers Resumed Work; Wages Increased by 18 Cents per Day; Garbage Truck Workers Expected to Resume Work This Morning

Regarding the matter of workers at the Public Works Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council, the result of negotiations between the Public Works Department and the workers' representatives yesterday was a resolution. The Bureau increased wages by 18 cents per day, and the workers have resumed work. The detailed agreed-upon measures are as follows:

Resumed Work Yesterday Morning

Road workers at the Public Works Department declared a strike on the 10th of this month. With the participation of garbage workers, cleaners, and night soil collectors, the situation was quite serious. The Public Works Department and the Police Department were deeply concerned and did their best to prevent the situation from escalating. At 7 p.m. on the afternoon of the 16th, Yao Ke, director of the Political Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Western Inspector Haite, Chinese Inspector Gao Yangen, detectives Wang Peiyuan and Kan Shuntang, etc., summoned the workers' representatives Shen Xiaolong, Zhou Youyi, Chen Jipu, Liu Changsheng, Zhu Youfa, Wang A'gen, etc., to mediate. They earnestly persuaded them, explained the pros and cons, and expressed sympathy in principle for the workers' difficult living conditions and request for increased wages. However, the conditions proposed by the workers were somewhat excessive. The resolution scheme, which had been negotiated with the Public Works Department, was then informed to the workers. In addition to appropriate wage increases, wages would also be appropriately given during the strike period. After the various articles were explained in detail, the representatives of each part of the workers were satisfied, and they all resumed work yesterday morning.

Detailed Terms

The detailed terms of the wage increase are as follows: (1) The daily wages of road workers, ditch workers, and transport workers will be increased from 85 cents to 1.08 yuan, and cleaners will be increased from 77 cents to 1 yuan. (2) Half of the wages will be paid during the strike period and will be distributed within the next week. Transport workers will receive the same treatment as road workers. If it rains, half a day's wages will be paid after the roll call. Cleaners will receive double wages when snow falls. (3) Stone pavers and Shanghai carpenters will be increased from 93 cents to 1.11 yuan per day, lacquerers and Ningbo carpenters will be increased from 1.15 yuan to 1.33 yuan, stone chip workers will be increased to 1.20 yuan, and iron sign foremen will be increased to 1.22 yuan. (4) The wages of garbage workers will be increased by 25% starting on July 1st. Wages will be paid as usual during the strike period. Brooms, dustpans, and shovels can be sent to the Public Works Department for new items when they are no longer usable. The garbage that has been piled up in the alleys will be cleared by the garbage truck workers in the near future. The garbage on the roads and in the small vegetable markets will be cleared by the Public Works Department sending another truck.

Night Soil Workers

Night soil workers were not resolved at the same time because they were not within the scope of the Municipal Council's employment. However, the workers' representatives had petitioned the Political Department, requesting mediation. After the Political Department's earnest persuasion, they are expected to resume work first thing this morning. Their requirements are (1) a rice subsidy of 10 yuan per month (automatically cancelled when the rice price returns to 20 yuan), (2) an increase of 10 cents per month for each household that empties the toilet, and (3) an appropriate increase in rewards for washing toilets.

### Although Japan Hides its Disastrous Defeat, Red Ships Wait to Transport Wounded Soldiers; Facts Prove that it Cannot be Covered Up

The Japanese side has repeatedly suffered disastrous defeats on the border of Henan and Hubei provinces. According to statistics verified by the Chinese side, the Japanese army has been killed in various battles totaling 48,000 people. However, the Japanese side believes that its prestige is at stake. On the one hand, it creates an atmosphere of peace to confuse the world, and on the other hand, it claims to have captured a Chinese division commander to cover up its defeat. According to a Japanese military spokesperson at a press conference with reporters yesterday, on the 9th of this month, a Chinese army commander, Zhong Yi, commander of the 123rd Division, was captured on the front line in Central China, but died soon after due to serious injuries. A piece of yellow cloth was also shown, claiming that it was taken from Commander Zhong's military uniform. In addition, there were several cards and a photo of the division's garrison, but it was not possible to fully prove that this was the case.

Wounded Soldiers in Hunan and Hubei Waiting to be Transported Back to Japan

The Japanese military transport ship "Chitose" arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday. Yesterday, it loaded 400 to 500 Japanese sailors in Shanghai to return to Japan for rest. At the same time, several hundred Japanese sailors were exchanged for the returning Japanese sailors. It is also known that the Japanese Red Cross ship "Asahi Maru" arrived in Shanghai from Japan yesterday, loaded with a large number of medical supplies and military uniforms, which have been unloaded ashore. It is said that the "Asahi Maru" will wait in Shanghai to load wounded soldiers from the Hunan and Hubei front lines and will depart for Japan immediately for treatment.

### New Remittance Plan, Ninth Inspection Report

The ninth inspection report of the Shanghai Municipal Silver and Money Industry Remittance Inspection Committee is as follows: The total value of collateral submitted by various banks and firms as of March 31, 1940, was 55,500,621.83 yuan, including (1) goods 2,029,158.00 yuan, (2) securities 11,008,133.77 yuan, (3) real estate 42,463,330.06 yuan. The total amount of inter-bank remittance approved by the reserve committee as of March 31, 1940, was 34,564,000.00 yuan, including (1) the amount already used by various banks and firms 22,025,500.00 yuan, (2) the amount not yet used by various banks and firms 12,538,500.00 yuan. The approved amount for each bank and firm is less than 70% of the value of its collateral, which is in accordance with the regulations.

### Citizens Send Letters to Concession Authorities Requesting Effective Price Controls; Prices Rise Impatiently When Foreign Exchange Tightens; Now that the Exchange Rate Has Eased Sharply, They are Using Excuses to Delay

According to the Ping Ming News Agency, reliable foreigners close to Mr. Fearon, the Director General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, have learned that Director General Fearon has received a large number of letters from residents, requesting that effective measures be taken immediately to suppress prices within the concession in order to alleviate the suffering of the people. There are many such Chinese letters.

A Mountain of Letters

After being translated by the Shanghai Municipal Council, they were sent to Fearon. In addition, the Price Stabilization Committee of the French Concession has also received a large number of letters from residents requesting price controls, which shows the people's desire to control prices in the concession. The two concession authorities are properly planning on this urgent issue at present, so that effective measures can be taken and implemented. They are unwilling to tolerate merchants using high exchange rates as an excuse for not selling at low prices, as business profits and losses are not fixed.

Coal Dross Plummets

The Datong News Agency reported that the price of coal dross in the Shanghai market has plummeted due to the sharp easing of foreign exchange. According to the Datong News Agency reporter's investigation in the market, the market price of coal dross per ton has not changed since the US dollar was pegged at seven yuan, but due to the exchange rate, it has fallen sharply from the peak of 150 yuan to 127 yuan. Judging from the chaotic state of the market and the hoarders' eagerness to sell, the actual market price is still below the listed price. That is to say, calculated at the above price, the market price of coal balls per dan should at least fall to 7.67 yuan, which is inconsistent with the market price of 8.20 yuan. It is hoped that the coal ball industry will correct itself.

Flour Mills Express

Our Wheat Noodle Industry Association has sent a letter to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, requesting that prices be suppressed to maintain public order, because rice and flour have seen a crazy rise again in the recent price surge. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Fufeng and Fuxin flour mills in Shanghai, requesting them to take both into account. The entire process has already been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday, the Shanghai Flour Mill Industry Association replied to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, (above omitted) "We investigated that the panic of the citizens over food occurred this spring. Our factory responded to the request of the Shanghai Municipal Council and sold all of our stored flour at a fair price in January and February. Our factory has taken care of the public interest and can be said to be innocent of the city's compatriots, which should also be understood by the city's compatriots. As for the current retail price being high and living on the basis of scarcity, the true situation has not been understood for a long time, and there is no choice but to issue a statement. Foreign wheat has disappeared from Shanghai. In order to take care of the food of the whole people and maintain the employment of workers, our factory has to order foreign wheat. However, since the price of wheat is high and the exchange rate has shrunk, the cost has increased, and the price of flour is difficult to suppress. Only with the concern of the Shanghai Municipal Council for the food of the people, can we still suppress prices and reduce costs to meet demand. It is found that the wheat stored in the factory originally cost 174 shillings per ton, and the exchange rate previously agreed upon was 4.125, which is equivalent to 30.015 yuan per dan. Adding the machine and labor costs, if the selling price is 14.95 yuan, it can barely meet the cost (the Shanghai Municipal Council has records). However, maintaining the food of the people is our unavoidable responsibility. To this day, the flour in this street is only sold for 14 yuan per bag, and the export price has to be appropriately increased to make up for it. As for the raw material problem, the factory has a small amount of inventory, and there is still one ship of foreign wheat that has been ordered but not yet paid for. The fixed price is more expensive. Due to turnover and various reasons, the exchange rate has not been fully settled. The exchange market has changed drastically in recent days, and it is too late to collect it. To what extent the cost will increase depends on market conditions. The above is purely factual. Under the current circumstances, it is improper to hoard and live on the basis of scarcity, and it is also meaningless to sing high tunes. Taking care of both sides can achieve fairness in matters (middle omitted). We should ask you to reply to the Shanghai Wheat Noodle Industry Association truthfully, so that they know that our association's factories have absolutely no intention of hoarding and living on the basis of scarcity, but have the fact of suppressing prices and reducing costs, and we eagerly await it (below omitted)."

### Gas Price Increase

80% Added to Original Price, Implemented Starting This Month

The Shanghai English-owned Water and Fire Company, due to the recent soaring coal prices and huge increase in costs, had previously applied to the two concession authorities to set the supply of gas, starting this month, to charge an additional fee of 80% on the original price.

### Rong's Shenxin No. 1 Factory: Shareholders Sue for Return of Deposits; Factory Destroyed by Shelling, No Assets to Seize; Defendants Argue They are Also Shareholders and Cannot Be Held Liable; Case of Great Importance, Depositors Await Outcome

Shenxin Textile Company was founded by the late Rong Zongjing, the "Flour King" of Wuxi, who raised capital during his lifetime. Its textile factories were located in both Shanghai and Wuxi, numbering over a dozen. The total number of employees reached tens of thousands. These staff and workers accumulated their hard-earned money, saving it in the factory where they worked for interest. The company's shareholders and their families also

Deposited Funds in the Factory

Therefore, the amount of such deposits in the various factories of the company was very large. Since the outbreak of the August 13th Sino-Japanese War, its factories in the occupied areas could not operate because they were occupied by the Japanese. All the workers with deposits then withdrew their savings from the company for living expenses. However, the company's authorities, Rong Zongjing's sons Rong Hongyuan and Rong Hongsan, and recently, Zhang Jingren, son of Zhang Zhizhao, a shareholder of the company, also had several thousand yuan deposited in the Shenxin No. 1 Factory in Zhabei, which was repeatedly ignored. They then commissioned lawyer Cai Liucheng to

Send a Letter to Negotiate

But to no avail, and finally filed a lawsuit in the First Special District Court against Rong Hongyuan and Hongsan, stating that the deposit, up to June 21st of the 26th year, after deducting 5,000 yuan withdrawn twice, was still owed principal and interest of 58,809.46 yuan in legal tender. Shenxin is an unlimited company, and now has no assets available to pay off debts. According to Article 35 of the Company Law, "When the company's assets are insufficient to pay off debts, the shareholders shall be jointly and severally liable." Rong Hongyuan is a shareholder and manager, and Rong Hongsan is the heir to the estate of the deceased shareholder Rong Zongjing, and should

Jointly Bear Responsibility

For the payment. After the Rongs were sued, they also hired a lawyer to argue in their statement, pointing out that the money was deposited by Zhang Zhizhao, not Zhang Jingren. Currently, the No. 1 Factory has no assets to deal with external debts. Zhang Zhizhao is a shareholder, so both parties are shareholders. How can a shareholder demand responsibility from another shareholder? The case was heard by Judge Tao Dejun in court yesterday morning at ten o'clock, summoning both parties for investigation. After the plaintiff's representative lawyer Cai Liucheng stated the intention of the lawsuit, the defendant's lawyer presented the depositor list, and stated that the company's accountant had been

Invited to the Court

To prove that the money belonged to Zhang Zhizhao, and that his son was now suing, intending to be cunning, etc. The plaintiff's lawyer then rebutted, saying that Zhang Zhizhao was indeed a shareholder, but the defendant could not prove that Zhang Jingren was a shareholder and should be responsible for repaying the money. Judge Tao believed that the defendant had no objection to the amount being pursued, so there was no need to question the accountant, and the debate was concluded. The judgment was scheduled to be announced on the 22nd of this month. Depositors who wanted to withdraw their deposits but could not were all awaiting the outcome of the case, so the judgment was of great importance.

### Citing European War as Excuse, Delaying Delivery; Foreign Firm Manager Loses Lawsuit

After the outbreak of the European War, the general merchants disregarded commercial ethics, and took speculation and cunning to profit. Yesterday, the First Special Court ruled on a noteworthy case. Wangfu Nail Factory was established by Xu Hengde, a wealthy merchant in Wuxi. The factory ordered 300 tons of raw material iron from the Belgian firm Wadelong Foreign Firm on May 8th of last year, stipulating delivery in August of the same year. By early September, the goods had arrived in China. After only 100 tons had been delivered, the Chinese manager of the foreign firm, Tong Kuixuan and Rong Jintang, delayed delivery on the pretext of soaring prices, trying to rely on foreign power to renege on the previous agreement and seize huge profits. After repeated negotiations failed, Xu then hired lawyer Tang Ying to file a lawsuit in the First Special Court for performance of the contract and compensation for damages. The court approved the request, and Judge Mo Runhua concluded the case. Yesterday, Tong Kuixuan and Rong Jintang were ruled to be jointly and severally responsible for delivering 200 tons of the nail-making raw material iron ordered by Wangfu Nail Factory, or compensating the plaintiff for the due profits of US$5,050.

### Taiyuan Oil Company Manager Embezzlement; Zhu Xiaofeng Sentenced to Imprisonment

Taiyuan Oil Company in Hai'an Town, Jiangbei, was jointly established by Wang Shouliang and his son-in-law Zhu Xiaofeng, specializing in the exclusive sale of Texaco kerosene and cigarettes from the Great Eastern Tobacco Company, etc. Wang served as general manager and Zhu as manager. Over the years, there was a slight surplus. However, since the fall of Hai'an, Taiyuan was unable to continue operating, and Zhu also fled to Shanghai for refuge. Now, conflict arose between father-in-law and son-in-law due to accounting checks. Wang then hired lawyers Wang Yaotang and Tao Wuzhi to accuse Zhu Xiaofeng at the Laozha Police Station of taking advantage of his position to embezzle more than 160,000 yuan of public funds. The police station arrested Zhu and the accountant Shi Boyin and sent them to the Special First Court, ordering Zhu to pay 30,000 yuan bail and Shi to pay 3,000 yuan bail to be released for accounting settlement. Then Wang and Zhu each hired accountants to check the accounts. At the same time, Zhu repeatedly explained to the registrar, and after the settlement conditions were agreed upon, Wang suddenly went back on his word when a contract was to be signed.

### Plot to Rob Wang Gongyun; Two Sons Deny Instigation; One Assailant Confesses to Robbery

Wang Gongyun from Yantai, Shandong, over fifty years old, was formerly the chairman of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Yantai and has wealthy assets. Recently, due to old age, he became tired of business and came to Shanghai as a sea-dwelling gentleman. Because he is a Christian, he lived alone in room 812 on the eighth floor of the Chinese YMCA at No. 123 Minni Yin Road in the French Concession. At 8:20 a.m. on the 16th, two young thugs suddenly broke into Wang's room, using

Visiting as a Pretext

Took out the fake pistol they brought, grabbed Wang, and squeezed his throat, attempting to rob him of his property. After Wang screamed loudly, the two thugs knew that the matter had gone wrong and fled out the door. The servants of the association heard the noise and closed the front and back doors to search. One had already run down the spiral staircase and escaped through the back door. Only one person was captured in room 825, and the discarded fake pistol was also found. The incident was reported to the police station, and Chinese and foreign detectives rushed to the scene and took the captured offender and the fake pistol to the case for interrogation. According to the confession, his name was Ma Fachang, and he was

Instigated by Wang's Two Sons

Wang Mingxing and Wang Mingyao, to rob their father of all his property. After the robbery, it was agreed to divide the loot at No. 33 Heng'an Lane, Berlbau Road, etc. According to the confession, the police arrested Wang's two sons one after another. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Criminal First Court of the Special Second Court, and Judge Zhang Minsheng interrogated them. The police lawyer Chen Ming stated the facts of the case and requested detention for investigation and rescheduling for further interrogation. Ma confessed that he and one person at large had gone to plot the robbery without hesitation, while the Wang Mingxing and Wang Mingyao brothers

Absolutely Denied

Participating in instigating the robbery of their father's property, etc. The court verified the confessions and ordered that the interrogation be rescheduled for the 37th.

### Patricide Case; Appellate Judgment (Continued)

Zhou Qinji's and Zhou Qixiang's grounds for appeal and their defense counsel's grounds for defense, which make arguments on facts and law to exonerate them from guilt, cannot be considered reasonable. Furthermore, while it cannot be proven that Zhou Jingmin conspired or assisted in the murder of Zhou Yongjie, it is an

Obvious Fact, clearly proven and admitted by Zhou Jingmin herself, that Zhou Qinji and his brother immediately told Zhou Jingmin the truth after they jointly electrocuted their biological father. Moreover, according to Zhou Qinji's confession at the police station, "After killing our father, we went to our mother's room and told her everything. She had nothing to say. My brother and I then proposed how to dispose of the body. We planned to cut up the body with a knife and then burn it. Our mother neither agreed nor disagreed." Zhou Qixiang also confessed at the police station that he had gone to his mother's room to discuss the disposal of the body. Furthermore, the original trial judge asked Zhou Qinji, "After the death, did you discuss destroying the body with your mother to cover up the traces?" He answered, "Yes." Zhou Qixiang then confessed, "We

Discussed with Our Mother the matter of destroying the body. Our mother didn't care." This shows that Zhou Jingmin knew about Zhou Qinji's brother's decision to damage their father's body and cover up the traces from the beginning. And since Zhou Jingmin knew that Zhou Qixiang's brother had decided to destroy the body and cover up the traces, but did not carry it out that night in the cloakroom, it must have been because dawn was approaching and there were no tools for destruction. This must also have been clear to her. The next morning, Zhou Qinji and his brother went out together and did not purchase tools for destroying the body such as knives and saws until about 3 p.m. They carried them back home and even met Zhou Jingmin downstairs. The knives and saws were

Clumsy Objects. Even if wrapped in newspaper, they could be recognized at a glance, unlike a schoolbag. Furthermore, considering Zhou Qinji's and others' eagerness to purchase tools to destroy the body, Zhou Jingmin must have been able to infer the situation. So how could she not have a considerable understanding when her sons Zhou Qinji and others carried the knives and saws home? Moreover, Zhou Qinji and others called their mother "killer of their father," so they immediately informed their mother after killing their father and openly discussed the plan to destroy the body in their mother's presence to comfort her mother. How could they not have

Informed Her of the Plan at the time of implementing the destruction of the body? Therefore, from whatever aspect one observes, Zhou Jingmin, though living downstairs while her two sons were destroying the body upstairs, in fact, all the movements upstairs were under her complete observation. Furthermore, Zhou Jingmin had a heart condition and had just suffered a family tragedy. Her chronic illness must have worsened. Based on common sense, she should have been resting in the room upstairs, but when the detectives arrested her (i.e., when Zhou Qinji and his brother were destroying the body), Zhou Jingmin was instead in the

Downstairs Kitchen, keeping company with the only maid employed by her family, Yang Pu. If there was nothing else going on, why would she do this? This is proven by the report of the Western Deputy Inspector Ge Yukefu on the search and arrest, which stated, "At that time, I went upstairs to knock on the door. After five minutes, Zhou Qinji came to open the door to the through room and went in. I heard that the body was on the balcony, but to get to the balcony, one had to pass through Zhou Jingmin's room, and a key was required to open the door to the balcony. Zhou Qinji said that the key was with his mother, so he went downstairs to get

A Bunch of Keys. He then opened the door to the balcony and found the severed body. Zhou Jingmin was in the kitchen, keeping company with the maid, talking to prevent her from going upstairs." It can be seen that Zhou Jingmin, disregarding her illness, was keeping company with the maid Yang Pu in the downstairs kitchen while her two sons were damaging their father's body on the balcony upstairs. This was indeed to keep watch and prevent Yang Pu and others from discovering the crime. There is no room for evasion. Although Yang Pu testified, "Unless it's time to sleep, the madam (referring to Zhou Jingmin) spends the whole day in the downstairs kitchen and does not go upstairs," after repeated questioning by this court, not only is it impossible for Zhou Jingmin's condition to endure working downstairs from morning to night, but there are also many inconsistencies and contradictions, which are obviously fabrications after the fact and are insufficient to be adopted. The original judgment that Zhou Jingmin participated in conduct other than the act of damaging the body with the intention of assisting her two sons in damaging the body, should be treated as an accessory to the crime of damaging the body. Furthermore, because she did not remember her marital affection and allowed her husband to suffer the tragedy of dismemberment, she is also inexcusable. However, since she is an accessory, the punishment should be reduced by one-third from the punishment of the principal offender and severely punished. Therefore, in accordance with Article 30, Article 247, Paragraph 1, and Article 66 of the Criminal Law "omitting the disclosure of Article 250 and Article 31, Paragraph 2 of the same law," she was sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment with due discretion, which is also not inappropriate. Zhou Jingmin's grounds for appeal, which merely make empty statements and defenses, such as staying downstairs all day and never keeping watch to destroy the body and patrol, are also unreasonable. In summary, the judgment should be made according to Article 360 of the Criminal Procedure Law as stated in the main text.

Dear Editor,

Greetings. On the morning of the 17th of this month at about 8:25 a.m., I passed by the south side of Henan Road and Guangdong Road and saw someone robbing a passenger sitting in a rickshaw of his hat.

### Finance: Foreign Exchange Bulls and Bears Uncertain

Yesterday's foreign exchange market conditions: HSBC's listing has not changed, although the dark market trend of the British and American exchange rates is loose, there are many mid-way fluctuations. This shows that people are in a state of suspicion about the market, and operators have no fixed pace. Although there are unfounded rumors that the Chinese government will issue currency notes, the rumors that Italy will participate in the war and that a new Sino-US loan will be established are even more prevalent. The exchange rate between the US and the UK continued to rise by 2.75 points, resulting in a morning opening of British flat and American loose. Chinese and Western merchants first threw out, and foreign banks had no interest in entering. The shilling reached the 4-pound barrier, and the US dollar loosened to 5.4375 yuan. Huayi Bank suddenly came to absorb fiercely, and there was a favorable air. Chinese merchants once tried hard to pull up, and it was heard that 6,000 yuan of cash had been withdrawn, and the tight situation was even sharper. The tight price was seen at 3 pounds 90625 for the shilling and 5.25 yuan for the US dollar.

### Favorable and Unfavorable News Spread, Gold Market Still Up and Down, Up and Down 370 Yuan All Day, Result Still Fell 110 Yuan

Yesterday's cash market was unstable, rising and falling sharply inside and outside the 6,000 yuan mark. The buying sentiment in the market was quite strong, so the result was only pressed down by more than 100 yuan. The morning opening was 5,950 yuan, a sharp drop of 130 yuan from the previous day. At that time, the foreign exchange rate was rising, and people's hearts were loose. Money exchange industry tried to sell down again by 100 yuan. Around 11:00, the exchange market reported soft, and there were rumors in the market that currency notes would be issued, so there were more entries and fewer exits, and the monthly speculators newly bought, and the strength was quite strong. Before long, it led to 6,100 yuan, but the environment turned unfavorable before the noon closing, and finally the closing price was 5,870 yuan. The market was still flat at the beginning, and later reported that Italy had made contact, and people's hearts were disturbed. Sellers gathered, and the lowest actually retreated to 5,730 yuan, but soon it was said that foreign banks in the city held another meeting, and the result was not good, but it aroused public speculation that the foreign banks' appetite for the exchange market would turn prosperous, which led to securities help silver number asking for goods very eagerly, and the trading jumped before the closing, reaching 6,060 yuan, but the result was still only 5,970 yuan, a small 110 yuan compared with the previous day. The transaction was still prosperous all day, with a total of 4,000 taels. The rise and fall of silver jewelry in silver shops was uncertain, and finally it was flat. The customs gold was as usual.

Cash Re-enters the 6,000 Yuan Mark

Since the beginning of the morning, each tael (10 taels), due to the loosening of foreign exchange rate, people's hearts were weak, and the market opened with a press of a small 130 yuan, which was 5,950 yuan for the money exchange industry to issue 20 taels of gold. After the opening, the selling trend became more intense, and the money exchange industry and silver number helped to sell first, and there were also many retail investors who followed the trend to sell, so it fell another 100 yuan, and the money exchange industry issued 30 taels of gold, which was 5,850 yuan. Then, the foreign exchange rate turned soft, stimulating the buying trend, and in addition, a certain silver number was eager to cover the short, and securities help and gold number also competed to buy, so it rose back 150 yuan, and the securities help entered the gold number 20 taels, which was 6,100 yuan. Later, rumors suddenly spread in the market that a new Sino-US loan had been established, and that Italy was about to participate in the war, so the selling trend rose again, and the silver number help changed from entering to stuffing, and at the same time, the securities help sold out a lot, and the exchange market also changed from gathering to seeing loose and hard, and soon it fell sharply by 280 yuan, and the money exchange industry issued 30 taels of gold, which was 5,820 yuan. Near the closing, the gold number pulled up slightly, raising 50 yuan slightly, and the gold number mutually made 50 yuan, which was 5,870 yuan as the noon closing price. After the closing, it was suddenly rumored that the European Allied forces had won a great victory and recovered Norway. A certain gold number continued to include, raising another 50 yuan, and 5,920 yuan once had a transaction. When it opened in the afternoon, because the above rumors were suspected to be unfounded, a certain gold number first shouted 5,900 yuan to sell, but there were very few buyers, so it shouted 30 yuan lower, and the silver number issued 10 taels to the money exchange industry, which was still 5,870 yuan. Later, the securities help slightly salvaged, raising 30 yuan, and the securities help entered the gold number 30 taels, which was 5,900 yuan. At that time, it was suddenly rumored that Italy had had contact with Yugoslavia, and the foreign exchange market also reported hard, and everyone rose up to exit, and was suddenly pressed down by a small 170 yuan, and the silver number issued 30 taels to the securities firm, which was 5,730 yuan. Then, the foreign exchange rate turned soft due to the foreign banks' appetite turning prosperous, and the gold number and silver number province came to salvage in, and pulled up more than 100 yuan immediately, and then the securities help and a certain silver number scrambled to drag wildly, and suddenly rushed out of the 6,000 yuan mark, and the securities help entered the gold number 100 taels, all of which were 6,060 yuan. After entering, the buying trend gradually subsided, and the button number help came to spit out slightly, so it returned to a small 90 yuan, and the gold number issued 20 taels to the silver number, which was 5,970 yuan as the evening pasture price.

At 4:10, it fell back by 10 yuan to 610 yuan (closing reduced by 30-40 yuan), a small 10 yuan.

### Foreign Currency is Finally Difficult to Make Progress

Yesterday's foreign currency market, the British and American gold pounds still had no shortage of supply, and the market price was depressed and difficult to revive. The British gold ticket was only tending to be weak because the black market British exchange rate finally closed loose and hard. The US dollar ticket opened slightly soft at the beginning, and after the opening, there were sudden rumors about the currency notes, so it once rose to 18.7 yuan. Later, the news that Italy was about to participate in the war and that a new loan would be established between the US and China, the black market US exchange rate suddenly loosened, and the selling of US tickets was suddenly prosperous. It once retreated to 17.9 yuan in the afternoon, and finally returned to 18.15 yuan, still 4.5 yuan smaller than the previous day. In addition, such as Hong Kong tickets, and Singapore, Annam, Philippine tickets, the supply was evenly spread, and the market prices were all tending to be weak. However, the demand for Japanese gold tickets was still strong, and the market price continued to be as high as 1.16 yuan, and there was a slight demand for Korean tickets, and the evening market was 0.92 yuan.

### Yarn Flower: Big Players Come Out, Yarn Market Falls Again

The yarn market fell again, but the trend was slightly more moderate. The frenzy of the previous month, the minds of speculators, were also quiet, step by step, but the foreign exchange rate turned to lengthen, and the bulls' minds were pale again. Big players from banks have come out in recent days, and the market situation is not prosperous.

The spot yarn selling in the morning was extremely strong, because the bulls were settled, and the foreign exchange rate rose slightly, and the gold price fell, and the selling in the market was particularly strong. The opening price of 20 branches of Bianma was 1,280 yuan, and dozens of packages were traded. Then, because the buyers were enthusiastic, it slowly recovered to 1,380 yuan. After a while, it was heard that the exchange rate was loose, and the buying momentum was weak, and it fell back to 1,330 yuan at the closing. The statistics for the half-day transaction were 1,650 packages, and the quotation for 20 branches of Shuangma fell by 30 yuan. Chongxin Factory opened 100 packages of 20-30 branches of Dafa, and the price was 1,390 yuan. The amount of purchases from each gang is listed as follows:

Fellow Traders 810 Hong Kong 840

Total: 1,650

### Cotton is Brought Down by Yarn

The transaction of native cotton has improved slightly, but the quotation has fallen sharply. This is because the world war is fierce, and the US and Indian cotton markets are falling, so the procurement calculation is very cheap. At the same time, the yarn market is not prosperous, and people's hearts are empty. The transaction of spot cotton is listed below, Brazilian cotton 39.00 Fellow traders enter 310 pieces 280.00

Dazhongji 180.00 again 410 packages 280.00

again 284.00 Xinshengjin 200 packages

Fire grass package 240.00 Fellow traders enter 240

Bao Pingguoer 190.00 again 100 pieces

Another message: the foreign cotton market price, the New York cotton market fell at the beginning of the morning due to the decline in the Liverpool telegraph, and later stabilized due to peer purchases and a part of the short covering. As a result, the near and distant periods rose 45 pounds each compared with the previous day. India fell another 10 rupees yesterday.

The transaction of foreign cotton in Shanghai, because the New York cotton market is stable again, the Tianjin gang has a healthy appetite, and the peers are also active again. The bottom of Shanghai is thin, and the difficulty of transporting foreign cotton to Shanghai is increasing day by day. It is heard that the demand for cotton in North China is very strong, and all the spot goods on the market have been transported to Tianjin. Therefore, the peers have a high mind for the selling price of raw cotton. The spot price of cotton yesterday is converted into the futures factory price with the US exchange rate of 5 yuan 3125, as follows:

20 branches of American Meterlin 347.90 and under 337.50

32 branches of again 371.50 and under 362.20

42 branches of again 374.90 and under 360.50

### Grains: Imported Rice Still Expensive, Domestic Rice Stabilizing

The rice market shifted from sluggish to tight due to the recovery of gold prices, boosting confidence. After the market opened in the morning, within moments, the prices of various types of imported rice quietly rose by $1.30 to $1.40. For example, "Small Twist" (小絞) opened at $48.30. However, given the recent market fluctuations and volatility, the desire for quick profits waned. Suddenly, as prices rose, sellers rushed to unload their holdings, causing prices to fall again by $0.60 to $0.70. By midday, "Small Grain" (小紋) opened at $47.70. Afterwards, prices fluctuated but without significant ups or downs. Eventually, "Small Twist" closed at $47.50, only $0.50 higher than the previous closing price. The situation was similar for other types of rice. "No. 1 Saigon" was priced at $51.00 or $50.05, "No. 2" at $48.30 or $47.80, "Fire Twist" at $49.50 or $49.00, "No. 1 Siam" at $49.00 to $48.50, "No. 2" at $47.50 to $47.00, and "Tokyo Pointed Special" at $47.00, then down to $45.50.

The supply and demand for glutinous rice were similar, resulting in little change. However, in the early market, glutinous rice prices rose by more than $0.50 along with imported rice. "Jin Li Special Yuan" (金溧特元) sold for $43.50 to $43.00, "Chang Dan White Yuan" (常丹白元) for $42.50 to $42.00, and the price for "Chao Rou" (潮柔) remained at $40.00.

Regarding the domestic rice varieties such as thick and thin "Geng" (粳) rice, another 1,300 to 1,400 bags arrived yesterday. Rumors suggest that off-market sentiment remained calm as a result, and selling prices did not increase, indicating a stabilizing situation. "Wuxi Special Qing Geng" (無錫特淸粳) remained at $52.00, "Fen Geng" (粉粳) around $50.00, "Chang Kun Geng" (常崑粳) at $51.00 to $51.00, then down to stored goods at $47.00 or $48.00, "Qing Si Special Thin" (靑泗特薄) around $51.50, then $51.00, then down to $48.50, and "Nangang Early Rice" (南港早稻) at $47.00 or $48.00, it was reported.

Imported rice prices rose in the morning yesterday, stabilized at noon, and then fell again in the afternoon. The market had long lost its normal state, completely tracking foreign exchange, gold prices, and sentiment. Actual sales and inventory were not being paid attention to by the market. Buying interest was strong in the early market, with buyers from Ningbo and other regions purchasing in bulk. Prices were raised across the board. However, as gold prices fell, selling pressure increased and prices stabilized. In the afternoon, speculators actively sold, causing the market to decline again. The Miscellaneous Grains Association reported that "Small Twist" reached $48.45 in the early market, "No. 2 Saigon" around $49.00, and "No. 2 Siam" $48.00, several cents higher than the previous evening. However, by afternoon, "Small Twist" was down to $47.23, "No. 2 Saigon" $47.50, and "No. 2 Siam" $47.00, more than a dollar lower than the morning's high and lower than the previous evening. Original bags of "No. 2 Saigon," 200 tons, were bought back by Ningbo buyers at prices between $61.50 and $62.00, due to consumer preferences for this type of rice.

In the Wuxi rice market, due to the high prices of rice from various regions, supplies became scarce. Speculators released their stockpiles, while new speculators held firm. Warehouse inventories dwindled, and merchants from other regions continued to purchase actively. Wholesalers and millers were engaged in active transactions, and sellers were confident that rice and paddy prices would continue to rise. The current selling price for "Wuxi White Geng" rice was $32.80 per "shi" (石), continuing to increase. Although the Rice Tea Association limited the price to $33.50 per "shi" and announced to the industry that they should not raise prices excessively or manipulate the market, the market price eased slightly. High-quality rough "Geng" rice was $30.45 per "shi," and the general market price was around $30.00. "Geng" paddy was $15.50 per "shi," and standard "Yuan" paddy was $14.78. Retail prices for white "Geng" rice were limited to $33.00.

### Flour Market Still Weak, Domestic Flour Prices Loosening

Yesterday, the flour market remained weak and lackluster. "No. 2 Flour Mill" still required the original price of $14.00, and although the resale price of goods from "Old Car Brand" mills was comparable to the mill's price, it was difficult to find buyers. Wholesale transactions on this street have decreased due to the impact of domestic flour dumping, with only over 4,000 bags being directly sold by various factories. It was reported that "Shun Feng Brand" domestic flour had some transactions at a price of $13.55, another $0.05 lower than the previous day. Other transactions were quiet. 500 bags of flour are being shipped to Yantai. There was still no market for wheat.

### Securities: Only Scattered Transactions in Government Bonds

The over-the-counter securities market was extremely sluggish yesterday. Market sentiment weakened again, and price fluctuations were minimal. However, there were rumors after the market closed of a new Sino-American loan, which, while possible, has yet to be confirmed. The volatility in Shanghai's financial market is difficult to stabilize in the short term, and government bonds are inevitably subject to fluctuations. Yesterday morning was comparatively weak, and the afternoon was slightly firmer. Both buyers and sellers were largely watching from the sidelines. Most of the participants in the market were retail investors, entering and exiting with 5,000 to 10,000 shares, and trading was relatively frequent. Xinchang, Hongkang, Jiufeng, Tiansheng, and Dahua were buyers, while Lianhe, Yitai, Dingkang, and Tongkang were sellers. As a result, prices for Class A bonds were slightly better by $0.05, while other classes were slightly lower by $0.01 or $0.02. The trading volume totaled $600,000 to $700,000. A summary table is listed below:

Category Highest Lowest Closing Compared to Previous Day

Unified A 59.60 59.40 59.60 Up 0.05

Unified B 51.45 51.40 51.40 Down 0.20

Unified C 49.75 49.40 49.45 Down 0.10

Unified D 48.30 -- 48.30 Down 0.20

Unified E 50.00 49.90 49.90 Down 0.15

Thirty shares of coal industry bank stocks were traded at a price of $35.00.

Furthermore, the General Industry Association reported that although news of the European war has improved, stock market movements remain uncertain and the trend is slightly softer. This is mostly due to the weekend effect. Although those holding long positions know that prices are too low, they have no choice but to close out their positions in a timely manner. Furthermore, some pessimists are concerned about events that may occur during the weekend holiday, so they follow the trend and tend to sell. However, facts show that even New York traders, who were struggling in turbulent waters a few days ago, have gradually become more optimistic. The major decline in the local stock market a few days ago was partly influenced by New York.

Trading in industrial stocks was extremely high, with British American Tobacco (BAT) stocks leading the way. The highest price was $43.50, and the lowest reached $39.25. There were almost no transactions in Shanghai Silver Company shares. Finally, 1,500 shares were traded at $23.00, down $1.00 from the previous session. International and Yangtse stocks also fell slightly.

Rubber stocks remained very soft, with only Rubber Trust stocks holding firm, with little change from the previous closing.

Kurau Rubber Plantations shares rose 6 pence to 18 shillings. HSBC shares registered in England fell £1 to £86. Shares registered in Hong Kong fell £2 to £86.5.

### Oil Market: The Depressed Oil Market; No One Dares to Trade Speculatively; Some Bean Cake is Shipped Inland

### Tiger Escapes from Cage

The deposed king of Oudh, India, once acquired two tiger cubs and kept them in a cage. The tigers grew large, but were very tame. A few days ago, the tiger keeper entered the cage to sweep and clean, and forgot to close the cage door. The tiger escaped into the enclosure, causing great alarm! Everyone discussed how to kill the tiger. One tiger was shot dead, and the other frantically ran out, swam across the river to the opposite bank, and entered a public garden. A gardener, Jia, happened to be standing with a Western friend in front of the gate. He caught a glimpse of the tiger coming, and quickly retreated into the room. After a while, he heard no tiger sounds. Jia came out of the room to look for the tiger. The tiger suddenly emerged from the depths of the forest and pounced on Jia, who fell to the ground and was injured by the tiger's claws. He fled to safety. The tiger wandered around for a while, and then returned to the forest. The garden is vast, covering dozens of miles. Hundreds of Indians visit it every day. Hearing that there was a tiger, the tourists disappeared. In the evening, everyone heard the tiger roaring, and the sound shook the valleys. The gardeners crawled around the garden, and found two cows in the cattle pen, both of which had been killed by the tiger. One cow was killed in the pen, and the other was killed outside the pen, with the tiger gnawing on its arm. The matter was reported to those who were eager to hunt, and they brought companions and weapons into the garden. The tiger came out from between the trees again, injuring one person, who was almost in danger. They all returned in disappointment. At sunset, several strong men came from the Indian capital, but they still did not dare to attack the tiger and left. The people in the garden urgently wanted to eliminate the tiger threat, and discussed it among themselves. Someone suggested: "The tiger relies on cows for its food. Cows are what we abandon, and what the tiger fights for. It is better to use cows as bait."

Medicine

### Aviation Sickness

— Wen He

In recent years, the aviation industry has become increasingly developed, greatly influencing human life. Aviation has its benefits, but also its drawbacks. Whether its application is proper or improper is a major question, which we will not discuss for the time being. According to recent research in the medical field, a person who lives in the sky for a long time is prone to developing various diseases, most of which were previously unnoticed. The Director of the US Army's "Aviation Medical Research Institute," Aimus Qulong, has published a specialized book called "Aviation Medicine," which has made a great contribution in this field. We will briefly introduce the diseases of aviation personnel mentioned in the book below:

The most common disease of aviation personnel is ear disease, because the air pressure changes greatly when the aircraft rises and falls, which greatly affects the health of the eardrum. Furthermore, the aircraft constantly emits a monotonous, noisy sound due to the engine's vibrations, which is also harmful to health. Among aviation diseases, a very common one is "Aerotitis media." This disease occurs because the air pressure inside the ear differs too much from the surrounding air pressure when the aircraft changes altitude. In the early stages, one feels hissing, knocking, and strange noises inside the ear, and eventually experiences severe pain and dizziness, often leading to deafness. To prevent this disease, one can shout and sing loudly in the aircraft, which can balance the air pressure inside and outside the ear.

The monotonous roar of the aircraft not only damages the auditory nerves, but also reduces the secretion of digestive juices such as saliva and gastric juice, so aviation personnel often suffer from stomach problems. In addition, if the external air pressure decreases, the air inside the intestines will expand, which can cause severe abdominal pain.

There is seasickness when traveling by boat, and there is "airsickness" when flying in an airplane. The nature of this disease is not yet fully understood. Aimus Qulong believes that this is probably because there is a subconscious fear of falling, which causes various symptoms.

Much more serious than "airsickness" is "high altitude sickness," which is caused by insufficient oxygen supply at high altitudes. Although high altitude sickness can occur at an altitude of 9,000 feet, the patient himself may not feel any symptoms in the air. Because the higher one flies, the less oxygen there is, and the more sluggish one's senses become, so one's perception of pain also becomes muddled. A pilot can still feel comfortable flying at an altitude of 15,000 feet or 18,000 feet for four or five hours, believing that he does not need to use a cumbersome oxygen mask. However, after landing, he will experience headaches, dizziness, vomiting, weakness, and other symptoms. Using an oxygen mask can prevent this, but Aimus Qulong believes that if one flies at an altitude of more than 20,000 feet, and the safety of the flight depends on breathing oxygen, it is always unreliable.

After an aircraft rises rapidly to a high altitude, the aviator will develop "aeroembolism." The cause of this disease is the formation of nitrogen gas bubbles in the blood and spinal fluid, which obstructs blood circulation. There are many symptoms: nerve inflammation, joint pain, severe red rashes on the skin, and stabbing and burning pain in the lungs. If an aviator feels these symptoms, then he has no choice but to fly down quickly.

### Learning Until Old Age

— Pu Ming

"One can be an official until old age, but learning never ends!" Although it's a common saying, it holds great value. When a person reaches old age, they often feel incapable and lament, "Why didn't I learn more back then, to avoid suffering now!"

What should one learn? Nothing more than enriching life's resources. Therefore, our life can be called a "life of learning."

The human world encompasses everything. Nothing is simple. Merely using our eyes to see, our ears to hear, and our brains to think and judge will not be effective. We must learn in order to fully understand everything and solidify our lives.

However, some people don't like to learn too much. They say, "Life is just like this; learning enough to be useful is sufficient. Let's save our energy for enjoyment!"

Indeed, learning is not a simple or easy task. Learning from books, learning from society, learning from nature, learning from humanity… The scope of learning is vast, requiring a long time and immense effort. No wonder some people are daunted by it. However, we must know, can our learning truly reach a state of satisfaction, a time when it's "enough?"

I can say: Life is ever-changing. What is learned in one period cannot be useful for a lifetime.

If you "learn one thing and use one thing," then you will realize that what you have learned is not enough to apply, and you will often experience the panic of "lack" and "emptiness." There is still much you need to learn.

Let us not be afraid to learn. Applying everything we learn to the fullest will surely bring joy.

We must learn until old age!

### The Waste of Life

— Liu Daohong

This is indeed the reality: many people are so burdened by the weight of life that they can barely breathe. They toil all day, all month, even all year, without a chance to rest. Advocating for daily rest days for these people, I believe, has unparalleled value.

However, the unreasonable existing social system (forgive me, I must mention the social system) allows another group of people to exist who, based on some kind of power, do not work but have food to eat. They themselves believe that because they have food to eat, it is only natural that they do not work. Their brains become blocked due to disuse, and their bodies accumulate too much fat due to inactivity, leading to a risk of stroke. In their eyes, work is merely for obtaining bread. They do not know the creative significance of work for life, nor do they know that in one's short life, one should hurry to do some valuable work that benefits humanity.

These people live in comfort, taking tonics throughout the year, as if cherishing their lives; in fact, it is this group of people who cherish life the least and waste it the most ruthlessly. Their limited lives are wasted daily in meaningless pastimes. Life in their hands is like a deflated balloon, slowly rising before eventually being destroyed, leaving not a trace in time and space. What is the meaning of such a life, and why bother taking a trip to the human world?

Time passes relentlessly day by day, and life shortens day by day. However, this cannot awaken them to start living a meaningful and valuable life from early on! They still muddle through each day, waiting for time to end their lives, without the slightest regret. Who says they cherish their lives?

These people rest all year round, living in a semi-dead state. They do not feel the pressure of life. A quiet life corrodes and rusts their minds. At this point, they themselves do not want to do anything, and their brains are too dull to handle any task.

They may think that this is the so-called "blessed person," but in reality, they are simply wasting their precious lives in vain. What a pity!

### The Children's Relief Movement, Expressing Boundless Compassion

— Ou Li

Last month (April), an unprecedented children's relief movement swept through public schools in the United States. Each school had a donation box, where students voluntarily deposited the money they saved from buying candy, ice cream, and movie tickets. No one forced them; this movement was purely voluntary.

This children's automatic fundraising was a protest by the pure little hearts of America against the violence of aggressors and evil forces in the world. The purpose of the donations was to help innocent children in China, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Spain, and the occupied countries of Germany and Finland who had suffered the ravages of war. American educators wanted to use this movement to cultivate compassion in happy children for the unfortunate. This movement also powerfully expressed the belief of American children that everyone in the world has the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

The origin of this movement was accidental. It turned out that one day, residents of Wilmington, Vermont, in order to express their sympathy for the oppressed, published a notice calling for a citizens' meeting to discuss whether they could help the refugees. As a result, it was decided to invite fifty or sixty German refugee children to live in their town in the summer of the following year, to learn English and to let them understand the life of Americans. For this matter, the whole city was excited and the results were exceptionally satisfactory.

The initiator, the American novelist Mrs. Fisher (Dorothy Canfeld Fisher), saw the great significance of refugee relief, and then launched a nationwide children's relief movement. This idea aroused the attention of people from all walks of life, who have successively given support such as Pearl Buck and other writers, professors, officials, church leaders, labor union leaders, who did not fail to give their support, and as a result it has become one of the most common movements in the United States in recent years.

During one week of this movement, public schools throughout the United States, when teaching history, civics, and current affairs, focused on American traditions, ideals, and the world situation, so that children had a deeper understanding of the present world.

The donations received were publicly entrusted to Mrs. Roosevelt, Mrs. Fisher, White, Ryan and other famous figures to control the use, so that every penny would be used on the refugee children. The cost of this movement was paid by the publishing house of Hitler's "Mein Kampf," which extracted a portion of the profits from the sale of the book.

### The Mistake of Life

— Zao

The biggest mistakes in life are:

Hoping to establish your own standard for judging right and wrong, and hoping that everyone will follow your standard.

Using your own entertainment as a comparison to measure other people's entertainment.

Hoping that everyone in this world will agree with each other.

Trying to force all kinds of people's temperaments into the same type.

Being unwilling to yield on unimportant trivial matters.

Troubling yourself and others with irreparable things.

When others need help, we have the power but do not help them.

Not forgiving the weaknesses of others.

Believing that everything we cannot accomplish ourselves is impossible.

Never believing in anything beyond the scope of what our limited intellect can understand.

Judging people by their appearance.

The Art of Scriptwriting

Writing a play is difficult, but writing, directing, and playing the lead role is even more difficult. However, writing a spoken drama is not as difficult as writing a Peking opera. In addition to matching scenes and writing lyrics, Peking opera also requires considering singing and body movements, and the accompaniment of singing is strings, and the accompaniment of body movements is gongs and drums, all of which cannot be done rashly.

There are two factors in Peking opera scriptwriting: one is to write a play for a certain role, such as the elders Fan Shanshuo and others writing "Scattering Flowers" and "奔月(Running to the Moon)" for Mei Lanfang. One is to adapt a certain story that is suitable for drama into a play. Another is to fabricate a story for a certain meaning and deduce it into a play, all of which require finding actors for the script. The former is like "Farewell My Concubine," and the latter is like "Spring Boudoir Dream," with deeper meaning.

All scriptwriting can be full of twists and turns, or straightforward; can use hypothetical writing, or use realistic writing; can be extremely rendered, or lightly mentioned; can use complex writing, writing again and again, to be complex without being annoying; or use simple writing, to be simple and meaningful; can look at one place, but write in all directions, this is called the method of setting off the moon with clouds; or focus on the topic, like a long river, pouring thousands of miles. However, the general secret must be a consistent clue, and the scene must be tighter than the previous scene. It must not become looser and looser, then the audience and performers will all have an unbearable ending.

The good old scripts are countless. Briefly mentioning those that people are familiar with, such as "Four Scholars Visiting Mother," takes Yang Silang as a consistent clue, uses the method of straightforward narration, and uses the princess as the host in the guest. Except for the scene of sitting in the palace and returning the order, going to the Empress Dowager, going to Guan Guan, going to Zongbao, going to Liu Lang, going to the Empress Dowager, and going to the Four Ladies, all use the same technique for realistic writing, but people do not feel bored. The reason is that the characters on the list, except for the Empress Dowager and the Four Ladies who belong to Qingyi, the others are clown, xiaosheng, laosheng, and laodan. The songs are Yaoban, Wa Wa tune, Yuanban, and Liushui, which are all different. However, although the Empress Dowager and the Four Ladies both belong to Qingyi, one sings slow board and the other sings Yuanban, one is in Manchu dress and the other is in Han dress, and there are several scenes in between. These are all the skills of the scriptwriter. Another example is "Meeting of Heroes," which clearly focuses on Zhou Yu and Kong Ming, but Zhou Yu is extremely rendered, while Kong Ming is lightly mentioned everywhere, and a Lu Su is used to set off extremely, to Jiang Gan and Huang Gai, who are used to accompany Zhou Yu, the more Zhou Yu is accompanied by talent and wisdom, the more Kong Ming's mystery is revealed, but Kong Ming's mystery is never expressed by Kong Ming himself, this is the so-called hypothetical writing, this is also the skill of the scriptwriter.

In recent years, among the newly written plays, "Sunrise," "Warm Jade," and "Spring Boudoir Dream" are the most skilled. In "Sunrise," Jin Ba is always visible, but the audience's minds are full of the impression that Jin Ba's power is vast.

In "Warm Jade," Jin Zhong'er was initially played by Gan Sulian, and many viewers wiped their tears, and I could not control myself? Sulian's acting has never been so moving. Now it has been replaced by Jin Suwen, although I went to see it again, it was still sad and tragic, and the audience's handkerchiefs were like butterflies flying at one time, is it not the merit of the script? "Poor bones by the Wuding River, who is the person in the Spring Boudoir Dream" is the idea of the Spring Boudoir Dream, and Yanqiu's acting skills (including singing and acting) seem to be even better than scriptwriting, but the script is also important. At the moment of midnight, I can't express my intentions in a hurry. When I have time, I will write an article to discuss it in detail.

### The Eternal Movie World

— Haixing

Increasing the number of Chinese films. In recent years, the Yi Hua Company has been making great efforts to increase the number of productions. The reason is that the more productions there are, the average recurring expenses can be reduced. In other words, the cost per film can be relatively lighter. I have learned that Yi Hua already has as many as six films that are about to be completed, namely "Seven Emotions," "Taiping Heavenly Kingdom," "Guanyin," "Biography of Heroes," "Biography of Hongfu," and "Qin Xianglian," and "Three Smiles" will also start construction soon. In terms of the proportion of staff, the number of productions of Yi Hua is actually the first among Chinese films.

The great plan of Jin Xing. The rumor that Jin Xing Company will specialize in shooting works like Wen Tianxiang's "Shi Kefa" is not true as far as the reporter knows. The Jin Xing authorities have already stated that the works produced cannot contain toxins, but they are not limited to works like "Wen Tianxiang" and "Shi Kefa." Taking other subjects can also be non-toxic. According to Zhou Jianyun, "After a few productions, Jin Xing may intend to make a vigorous work to promote righteousness, even if it sacrifices a certain market, it is still worth it, because I am a citizen of the Republic of China, and it is a matter of course for citizens to love their country."

Detective films will be popular. It has been tacitly acknowledged by filmmakers that fashion films are about to revive, but the environment may not allow the production of stimulating works that target reality. I have learned that producers intend to open up a new path for detective films, because they are both fashionable and full of excitement, which seems to be able to take both into account.

### News from the Actors

Recently, the literary and martial arts comrades in the Shanghai acting world, due to soaring prices and difficult life, jointly planned to ask the authorities of each theater to increase their salary, divided into three kinds of 20%, 30%, and 40%. A meeting was held at the Tianshui Cottage the other day, and managers of the backstage were invited to participate in the assistance. Many people, including Zhou Xinfang, Chen Yuelou, Liu Kunrong, Tan Hongmei, Zhang Liankui, etc., attended. As a result, it was unanimously passed that a written request be submitted to the authorities of each theater on a specific date.

Xiaosheng Yu Zhenfei returned to Shanghai after the expiration of his singing period in Singapore and returned to his original home in Suzhou to sweep his tomb. Later, he came to Shanghai. It is reported that he will stay in Shanghai for another ten days before returning north.

The Lone Eagle Drama Troupe, initiated by Jin Suwen, Hu Tiwei, and Sang Hu, has recently received letters from drama fans who want to join, and there are many people. The troupe is preparing for the first performance of "Parasitic Grass," and most of the actors have been assigned, and they do not intend to recruit new members for the time being.

Chapter 24: The Scenery of the Lake and Mountains is Washed Away, Each with Its Own Merits; The Men and Women Rejoice and Shout "Long Live"

Later, they accompanied Mrs. Suriya to visit the nursery. At this time, Shao Huihua was the happiest. She wanted to see the triplets of the Luca family. And she brought a camera. She wanted to take pictures of these three little angels. Although she had seen their model clay figures in the Huiquan Mountain toy store in Wuxi, she had not seen them in person, and took the clay figures back, as if to align with the ancient book. The nursery was not like a hospital. A group of lively children, wherever they were, was enough to arouse interest. This nursery was very large, in a garden format. The houses were not very large, but they were very hygienic. They were scattered everywhere, and did not feel cramped in a corner. This was after all a township area, with plenty of land that could be expanded as much as possible. Mrs. Suriya was very satisfied with what she saw. She said: "In our America, there are many nurseries that are more magnificent than this one, but this nursery is considered lively. Generally, in running a public welfare undertaking, there cannot be a self-proclaimed charitable atmosphere. Thinking that I am running a charitable undertaking, everything is handled strictly, that is the most annoying thing. Now that I have seen this nursery, I should pay my respects to Dr. Zhang and all the ladies who are in charge." Originally, Dr. Zhang wanted to ask Mrs. Suriya for help, but Jin Dan had already reached it. Mrs. Suriya readily agreed. Just after she had already told Dr. Zhang, she herself was willing to donate 200,000 yuan in national currency, and she could also solicit 200,000 yuan from her American friends. This money was given to Dr. Zhang to listen to his disposal. Or it should be used more for hospitals, or it should be used more for nurseries, or more teachers should be trained, which can meet the needs of talents in the interior of China, and she would not interfere. Mrs. Suriya was a very enlightened person. Once she trusted this person, she entrusted him with full authority. Unless she did not trust that person, she would certainly not be willing to donate that money. She thought that they had been running the hospital and nursery for so many years, of course they were more clear than I, so why should I make any arbitrary claims? Moreover, Mrs. Suriya had been in China for a long time, and regarded China as her second nationality. She was also rich in the concept of world humanity, thinking that the people of the world should jointly handle the affairs of the world, and should not fight each other because of national boundaries. Human beings should help each other, and should not invade a certain race with a certain kind of nation. Human beings should use love to protect and help each other. In fact, because the world has gone through another world war, many clear-headed people have become aware. If we do not break the narrow opinions based on the country and race, the third world war and the fourth world war will follow one after another, which can make the human beings of the world almost nonexistent!
