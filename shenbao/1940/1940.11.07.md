### An Unprecedented Innovation in American History: Roosevelt Elected for a Third Term; Yesterday's Broadcast Speech Guarantees Maintaining a Strong Policy; Will Expand Embargo on Japan and Accelerate Aid to China and Britain

New York—President Roosevelt (pictured) has decisively won the election, achieving a nationwide victory and shattering all precedents in American history. By midnight, the President had a substantial lead in thirty-five states, securing a total of 425 electoral votes. Given that securing a majority of 266 votes is required for election, he has won.

Hyde Park—President Roosevelt, in a radio address to the nation this morning, stated that the United States is about to face a period of trial. The President also gave assurances regarding his third term, indicating that he would maintain the policies established during his previous two terms. (Sixth United Press Telegram)

Hyde Park—Some of President Roosevelt’s neighbors marched with torches to Roosevelt’s private residence. While speaking with them, Roosevelt stated that he accepted the will of the nation to serve as President for a third term in the White House. He said, "We are indeed facing difficult times for America, but you will see that the Roosevelt of the future will still be the Roosevelt of the past." He then said with a touch of humor, "This is truly astonishing. I only heard it from the news reports an hour and a half ago. You could have knocked me over with a feather." The victory of Roosevelt this time is the largest "vote of confidence" ever received by an American president. Democratic Vice-Presidential candidate Wallace also accompanied Roosevelt, succeeding Vice-President Garner. Garner did not seek re-election this time. The Democratic Party seems to have achieved a major victory across the board, with the Senate and the House of Representatives almost unanimously maintaining the Democratic Party's positions. Only in a few states did Republican candidates for governor and senator slip in. Statistics of two-thirds of the nation's votes show that Roosevelt received 16,950,796 votes, while Wilkie received 13,638,149 votes. (Sixth International Telegram)

Washington—President Roosevelt's victory for a third term was confirmed today at 11:30 AM (Shanghai time Thursday at 0:30 AM). However, Republican candidate Wilkie also received more popular votes than any unsuccessful presidential candidate in history. Roosevelt's re-election votes were confirmed at 9:50 AM today (Shanghai time Wednesday at 10:50 PM). At that time, twenty states, with a combined electoral vote of at least 266, supported Roosevelt. The electoral vote totals 531 votes, and Roosevelt securing 266 votes ensures his victory. Thus, Roosevelt became the first president in American history to serve a third consecutive term. After Roosevelt's re-election, his proposed "New Deal" can be extended for another four years in the White House. Chongqing's joy at Roosevelt's re-election is even greater than the reopening of the Burma Road and the recovery of Kunming. Furthermore, news reports that the total number of popular votes in the election, as announced at 9:03 AM (Shanghai time Wednesday at 10:03 PM), was 20,575,895 for Roosevelt and 17,195,962 for Wilkie. (Sixth United Press Telegram)

Washington—Neutral political observers here recently recognized that President Roosevelt's victory over Wilkie in the national election is a demonstration by the American people against isolationist policies and for close attention to the situations in the Far East and Europe. These observers pointed out that President Roosevelt is considered a warmonger by some American officials and the official newspapers of Germany, Italy, and Japan, and these individuals and newspapers clearly favored Wilkie. The American people, creating an unprecedented innovation by electing Roosevelt for a third term, clearly demonstrate their full support for the Far East and European policies advocated by US Secretary of State Hull. It is generally expected that after President Roosevelt's re-election, the United States will continue to adopt a strong policy in the Pacific, and American aid to Britain will be further accelerated due to the alignment of political views. (Sixth United Press Telegram)

New York—Responsible political figures here recently stated that Roosevelt's re-election will not eliminate the possibility of the United States being drawn into the war, nor can Roosevelt guarantee avoiding war. Roosevelt said that he would do his utmost to keep the United States out of the war. This undoubtedly means that he will bring the United States into the war when it becomes inevitable. These figures also stated that if Wilkie had been elected, at least for several months, due to the change of a new President and a new Secretary of State, Japan and the United States might have had another round of consideration regarding the Far Eastern issue. But now Roosevelt and Hull may continue, or even expand, their opposition to Japan's measures, such as embargoing scrap iron and gasoline. These figures also believe that Japan may have temporarily delayed its actions while waiting for the results of the US election, and that there may be important movements at this time. (Sixth United Press Telegram)

New York—As of 10:30 PM last night (11:30 AM this morning in Shanghai), the number of ballots cast in various locations were as follows: Roosevelt 4,575,920 votes, Wilkie 3,593,874 votes. Furthermore, as of 11:00 PM (12:00 PM this afternoon in Shanghai), Roosevelt's votes had surged to 6,433,958, while Wilkie's votes were 4,998,945. (Sixth United Press Telegram)

Washington—In the first million votes counted last night, President Roosevelt's votes were slightly ahead of Wilkie's. At 8:30 PM last night (9:30 AM this morning in Shanghai), Roosevelt had 679,396 votes and Wilkie had 509,126 votes. However, these are only scattered numbers from various locations, only enough to get a glimpse. From the votes obtained in 161 precincts in Indiana, Wilkie had a slight advantage, with 59,235 votes, while Roosevelt had 57,662 votes. (Sixth United Press Telegram)

New York—As of 9:30 PM on the evening of the 5th (10:30 AM this morning in Shanghai), the counted ballots listed are as follows: Roosevelt 2,626,636 votes, Wilkie 1,218,7081 votes. (Sixth United Press Telegram)

New York—The Democratic Party chairman claimed this morning that Roosevelt has been re-elected again. In the more than 15 million votes already seen, he obtained 56 percent and the support of 449 electoral districts, while Wilkie only obtained votes in 22 electoral districts. The New York Times now acknowledges that Roosevelt has a majority of votes in New York State. (Sixth Reuters Telegram)

New York—The local best-selling tabloid "New York Daily News" published news last night stating that President Roosevelt has been unprecedentedly re-elected as the third master of the White House. The newspaper has consistently supported President Roosevelt but acknowledged that Republican candidate Wilkie also had a great chance of being elected. At the same time, Democratic National Committee Chairman Farley told reporters that President Roosevelt was "very satisfied" with the initial election results. He also said that the news from New York State was very exciting, proving his prediction that it "would definitely support President Roosevelt." At 10 PM last night (11 AM Shanghai time this morning), Wilkie told reporters that the election was "a horse race" that would soon end. (Sixth International News Service Urgent Telegram)

Editorial

### Public Opinion and Common Sense

——Congratulating Roosevelt on His Election to a Third Term

The US election, which has been of intense concern to the entire world for the past few months, finally had its final answer yesterday; Roosevelt, with the support of the majority of the nation, overcame America's historical traditions and his powerful rival Wilkie, winning a third term as president. The dissemination of this surprising but not unexpected news should bring joy and celebration to most of humanity worldwide; at the same time, it will frustrate the schemers and ambitious individuals who had vainly hoped to gain from the change of the American head of state, although this hope was nothing more than an unfounded fantasy. That an internal election in the United States should cause such global concern is perhaps only comparable to the contest between Wilson and Hughes in 1916, when Europe was in the midst of war and the United States stood on the edge of intervention. However, in terms of the safety of the future of Europe and Asia, and the rise and fall of justice versus aggression, civilization versus barbarism, the importance of the United States today cannot be compared to any other era.

Before yesterday, general predictions considered Roosevelt to have a greater advantage, but also believed that the difference in votes between the two sides would be very close. The content of the two parties' platforms, apart from domestic affairs, such as national defense procedures, diplomatic routes, resistance to the Allied countries, and support for China and Britain, the Republican Party sought to be close to its rival party. This method of eroding public opinion and campaigning was already disadvantageous to Roosevelt, not to mention that Roosevelt took the significant risk of violating the two-term precedent; however, all of this was not enough to make voters turn to the Republican Party, which has always held an advantage in American political history, and the result was still that Roosevelt won by a large majority, setting an unprecedented example of entering the White House for a third time in 150 years. This is a victory for Roosevelt and the Democratic Party, but it is also a major victory for public opinion and common sense.

Comparing Roosevelt and Wilkie as individuals: the former is rich in ideals, the latter is more realistic; the former advocates control, the latter tends to laissez-faire; the former is a great and far-sighted political leader, the latter is a prudent and capable administrative talent; if it were a peaceful era of tranquility, perhaps people's desire to move forward could not resist conservative trends, thus affecting Roosevelt's future. However, in such a turbulent and extraordinary period, the political task is clearly not one that can be handled by a more conservative figure. Although Lloyd George and Churchill could not hold power in peacetime, Chamberlain had to resign after the outbreak of this European war. This, although an example from Britain, implicitly suggests who will ultimately belong to the office of the American head of state. Moreover, the American people have had bitter experience not long ago: Hoover, the most capable manager of the American bourgeoisie, was at a loss in the face of the economic panic of 1929, which plunged the United States into great suffering. Therefore, in this international political crisis, people naturally anticipate and prepare for the worst, carefully choosing a helmsman. Although Wilkie's vision, ability, and skill were better than those of the previous Hoover Landon, it could not change the minds of the majority of Americans, and even the traditional practice of hundreds of years was powerless; this sufficiently demonstrates the high esteem for Roosevelt and the people's deep faith; and the previous criticisms of the New Deal, opposition to control, and attacks on past governance and national defense achievements, etc., are sufficient to prove that they are only a minority of prejudices.

However, even if Wilkie had won, judging from his election platform, it could be believed that the major policies of the United States would not be greatly changed. Now that Roosevelt continues in office, he is familiar with the job, and the various wise measures that he had previously implemented and that had just begun to emerge will be fully continued and utilized, without any stagnation or obstruction. Moreover, if the aggressors opposed Roosevelt's re-election in order to take advantage of the opportunity of the change of power in the United States, then their opposition to Roosevelt only strengthens the reason why Roosevelt should continue to be elected. Now that attempt has clearly failed again. With the Allied forces gradually showing signs of strength, and the anti-aggression countries becoming stronger as they fight, with the great potential of the United States playing a decisive role, it will surely enable the great cause of reversing the chaos and restoring order to quickly achieve twice the result with half the effort; although the United States is rapidly completing wartime preparations, in fact, whether it participates in the war is not necessarily the main factor. On the other hand, the various evolutions of the international situation over the years have further proven Roosevelt's great ambition and extraordinary insight in the past, as evidenced by his sensational speech in Chicago on October 15, 1937. If it were not for the constraints of the neutrality law, the obstruction of the isolationists, and the narrow-mindedness of some politicians and businessmen, who disregarded justice, not only would the world not be so devastated, the Far Eastern situation would have been cleared up long ago, and democratic and independent Spain would still be standing firmly on the Iberian Peninsula, forming an important pillar of the anti-aggression movement. In the 1936 election, Roosevelt overwhelmed his political opponent Landon with an unprecedented majority of 99 percent of the vote, winning re-election, but in the following year, he unfortunately encountered major setbacks in judicial reform and the recovery movement; this past event should not be repeated in today's extremely serious internal and external crises, and it is hoped that the mutual recriminations and occasional emotional involvement during the election process are only temporary phenomena. Roosevelt has been able to recruit outstanding Republican talents to form a coalition cabinet, which shows that he will never allow partisan prejudices to hinder the implementation of national policy. Since the outcome of the election has proven where the will of the majority of Americans lies today, it will be able to overcome prejudices and divisions, as well as any ungrateful, isolationist, and selfish tendencies among the people, in order to promote its consistent, firm, and wise application.

Previously, American telegrams had indicated that the recent toughness of the United States' foreign attitude should not be mistaken for an election posture because everything will be even more advanced after the election is over; in addition to congratulating Mr. Roosevelt on his election victory, we hope that his great ambitions can be fully realized soon.

Preliminary Election Results Across the United States: The Vote Ratio Between Roosevelt and Wilkie is Three to One

Washington—After the preliminary elections held today in all election districts across the United States for the fiercely contested position of US President for the next four years, President Roosevelt's vote count has far exceeded that of Republican candidate Wilkie. Preliminary election results from all parts of the country, including the East Coast, the Midwest, the Southwest, and the "Solid South" believed to be in Democratic hands, have been urgently telegraphed here. With the numbers coming in, it is widely believed that Roosevelt has won in most election districts, breaking precedent and running for a third term as president. According to a report from Albuquerque, New Mexico, Roosevelt received 1,151 votes in 24 election districts, while Wilkie received 840 votes. According to the first urgent telegram from Topeka, Kansas, in the nine major cities of Kansas, including Kansas City and Topeka, Wilkie, one of the greatest presidential candidates in American history, has received 5,982 votes, while Roosevelt has received 5,497 votes. In the two cities of Hartford and Sprague in Connecticut, Roosevelt received 692 votes, while Wilkie received 371 votes. Roosevelt defeated Landon in that area with 612 votes to 394 in 1936. According to a report from the Baltimore election field in Maryland, in the 70 election districts where voting was completed, Roosevelt received 18,008 votes, while Wilkie received 17,162 votes. In Nashville, Tennessee, Roosevelt received the initial 953 votes, while Wilkie received 190 votes.

Incomplete reports sent to Atlanta from the election districts in Georgia stated that Roosevelt had 4,925 votes, far exceeding Wilkie's 20 votes. The ancient proverb, "As Maine goes, so goes the nation," was proven to be inaccurate in the 1936 election, as Landon won in Maine but did not win in other states. Today's Republicans, regardless of whether this proverb will be confirmed, believe that Wilkie can win in the election district in that state. The preliminary election result report arriving in Augusta from Eastern Maine stated that in the 629 election districts of that state, Wilkie received 256 votes, while Roosevelt received 189 votes. News from Hartford and Connecticut, in the three cities of Bridgeport, New Haven, and Gulford, Roosevelt has received 107,082 votes, while Wilkie has only received 65,706 votes. According to news arriving in Chicago, Wilkie received 702 votes in the election districts in Illinois, while Roosevelt received 450 votes.

### After Roosevelt's Election: Attitudes of Various Countries

Britain Extremely Delighted

London—Today, Britain is immensely pleased with President Roosevelt's great victory, recognizing that American aid to Britain will be even more substantial and increased. Various circles also believe that Roosevelt's election is tantamount to a blow to Hitler, and that democratic ideas have also gained an opportunity to rise. (Sixth United Press Telegram)

London—The Daily Telegraph commented on the American election, saying that regardless of who wins or loses in the American election, it will ultimately be a unified country. Today's political strife is intense, but after the election is over, it will be reconciled as before and live together in harmony. This is one of the best effects of a free political system, and it gives its country a stability that no dictatorship can hope for, as dictatorships rely only on secret police and concentration camps to force their people to obey and use murder to eliminate opposition from their people. (Sixth Reuters Telegram)

Italy Pessimistic

Rome—Today, after learning of President Roosevelt's re-election, the Italian people have expressed deep pessimism about the future of the Axis and American relations. They believe that Roosevelt will waste no time in preparing to have the country stand with England and participate in the war. Although the United States may not take any action within several months, from a long-term perspective, the United States will eventually become a formidable enemy. (Sixth United Press Telegram)

Japanese People Disappointed

Tokyo—Today, the only reaction in Japan to President Roosevelt's decisive election is disappointment, as the majority of opinions believe that America's Far Eastern policy, which has been dealing with Japan, has once again regained a good opportunity under the new American administration. Another reason for the disappointment here is that a considerable number of Americans approve of Roosevelt's tough policy towards Japan, so the current Japan-US relations cannot be improved. It is expected that tomorrow's Japanese newspapers will urge the government to prepare to deal with the anti-Japanese policies of the United States. (Sixth United Press Telegram)

Tokyo—A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced today that regardless of who is the president of the United States, its foreign policy, especially towards the Far East, must be reconsidered, because America's current Far Eastern policy is too theoretical and does not conform to reality. When asked if US Ambassador Grew had recently met with Foreign Minister Matsuoka, the spokesman replied that he had not, but said that the acting counselor of the US Embassy, ​​Mr. Kroger, had met with the Director of the American Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Terasaki, yesterday to discuss very minor routine matters. (Sixth Reuters Telegram)

### Roosevelt Casts His Own Ballot

Hyde Park—President Roosevelt today became the first American administrative leader to elect himself for a third term as president. It took President Roosevelt only 68 seconds to fill out his ballot in the green kiosk. He arrived at the polls at 12:20 PM. After voting, the President had a half-hour conversation with friends there, and then returned to his nearby villa to await the results. It is also learned that Mrs. Roosevelt and Roosevelt's mother were in the same car with the President to vote. The President smiled and was very happy that the most intense election campaign of this century had come to an end. The President's voting code was number 292, and his wife and mother followed him.

New York – After receiving news of Roosevelt's lead in votes at midnight, Willkie appeared pale and tired. He then met with his advisors in his New York hotel. Republican vice-presidential candidate McNary conceded Roosevelt's victory, but Willkie still did not express despair. It is recalled that in 1916, when Hughes competed with Wilson, Hughes felt he had more votes late at night and could definitely defeat Wilson, so he went to bed peacefully. Unexpectedly, the votes in California turned Wilson's defeat into victory. At this time, Willkie still hoped that he could win the final victory like Wilson, so he refused to concede defeat and encouraged those around him in the hotel not to be discouraged. (Reuters, 6th)

New York – Republican candidate Willkie announced at 1:30 AM today (2:30 PM Shanghai time) that he would go to bed. Willkie did not concede that he had failed.

After addressing his friends, Willkie returned to his apartment with his wife. Willkie said to his supporters, "Comrades, I have never been happier in my life. This is the first thing I want to say. I congratulate you on being part of the national crusade. The principles for which we fought will eventually be victorious. I hope you will never be afraid or discouraged, because I am neither afraid nor discouraged." (International News Service, 6th)

### Secretary of the Navy Knox Cheers Loudly, Saying Americans Strengthen Unity to Resist Totalitarian States

Chicago – US Secretary of the Navy Colonel Knox, speaking last night as the election results confirmed Roosevelt's victory over Willkie, cheered loudly, saying that President Roosevelt had won the election. Knox, a Republican, who was brought into the cabinet by President Roosevelt, transcending party lines, said that the majority of the American people have chosen President Roosevelt to lead them in dealing with the current serious situation. The people's victory for President Roosevelt shows that they have recognized the serious domestic and foreign crises facing the United States and want to elect a suitable president to continue a strong foreign policy, safeguard American interests, and accelerate American defense. The goal of the people's election is just and correct. Today's election has become the primary duty of every good American. Every good American is fulfilling this duty to strengthen national unity and will make openly combine strong opposition slow to those totalitarian states against us. A view of what the US is, Berlin, Rome, and Tokyo apparently hoped that our country would tend to unfortunate division before this election, but we must prove that their hopes are in vain.

### Italian Forces Advance on Ioannina, Korçë Surrounded, Italian Supply Base in Danger of Being Cut Off, Italy Claims Metaxas Line Breached

Belgrade – According to battle reports arriving here today, Italian forces crossed the Kalamas River this morning, threatening Ioannina, an important Greek transportation hub. Greek forces are concentrated there, preparing to repel the enemy. The Italian advance is meeting strong Greek resistance. According to battle reports, as Italian tanks and troops crossed the Kalamas River via pontoon boats and bridges and advanced into Greek territory, Greek forces attacked their flanks. The Italian advance, though in danger of having its supply base cut off due to the Greek attack on Albania, continues to advance towards Florina. According to the battle reports, Greek forces that have entered enemy territory have completely surrounded Korçë, so its fall is believed to be imminent, as the Greek army is advancing into Albania with amazing actions. Italian heavy artillery is bombarding Greek forces in the area, and Italian aircraft are circling and dropping bombs, but it is said that Greek anti-aircraft fire and fighters are sweeping away Italian aircraft in the air. (International News, 6th)

Rome – According to reliable news from Albania here yesterday, Italian forces have breached several points of the Metaxas Line. (United Press, 6th)

Athens – Greek commando units in skirts launched a fierce encirclement of Korçë this morning, intending to seize the important Italian base in Albania in one fell swoop. According to Greek high command, people here expect news of the city's fall to arrive soon. The communiqué said that Greek forces are attacking the outskirts of the city with bayonets and grenades. According to military observers, the fall of Korçë will threaten an Italian column advancing towards Florina, whose supply base has already been cut off. If the Italian forces continue to advance, it will be very dangerous. At the same time, it is reported that Greek vanguards have entered Albania with amazing speed, capturing 30,000 Italian soldiers near Korçë. It is said that Italy recently used bombers and fighters to cover the attack on Ioannina, but was repelled by Greek defense forces. 4,000 Italian soldiers advancing to the Epirus front have been completely isolated from the outside world in the rugged mountains of the area. It is also learned that Greek forces have entered Albania for more than ten miles. (International News Service, 6th)

Athens – According to a communiqué from the Greek General Headquarters just released, Greek highland troops are fiercely advancing on the Italian base of Korçë. Other Greek troops have also captured several highlands with semi-permanent fortifications on the Western Macedonian front. It is said that some retreating Italian troops were attacked by their own tanks. When Greek troops captured the highlands, they captured two artillery pieces, several mortars and machine guns, and several Italian soldiers. The Greek Air Force attacked the airfields of Korçë and Argyrokastro, destroying several Italian aircraft and hangars parked on the ground. All Greek aircraft participating in the air raid have safely returned to base. According to responsible sources, there has been no major development in the main attack within Greece, but it is possible at any time. According to reports received from the north at 6:00 AM on Tuesday, Greek forces are now fighting on the west bank of Lake Mikri Prespa. The fighting near Dischtraton in the Pindus region is mainly related to a unit of cut-off Italian troops. It is reported that Greek forces have captured at least 100 Italian soldiers, machine guns, radios, and other equipment in this area. The Italian troops are elite Alpine troops. The Italian side believed they were trapped in Mirovo, and sent planes to drop flour and other supplies, but the troops were no longer there, and the dropped gifts fell into the hands of Greek forces. According to Greek Army Minister, Greece destroyed nine Italian tanks using British-supplied flat-trajectory guns, and two Italian bombers were shot down on Tuesday, with no losses to Greek aircraft. (Reuters, 6th)

Athens – News from the northern front says that Greek highland troops (i.e., Evzones) are fiercely advancing on the Italian base of Korçë. Sources close to the Greek General Staff claim that the progress of Greek operations, judging from the news received yesterday, is extremely satisfactory. News from the northern front also says that Greek highland troops, armed with bayonets and grenades, have broken through the Italian defense lines around Korçë. Once Korçë falls, it will not only overturn the Italian military plans, but also have a major impact on the Albanian morale, which has been agitated under Italian control. Greek bombers attacked the Italian supply base of Argyrokastro, which supplied the coastal area of Epirus, and were very successful. Greek troops on the central front are surrounding large groups of Italian troops according to plan. Greek troops have held the places they have recently captured. Greek engineers are urgently transporting light equipment over the steep mountains and countryside to the front lines, which is especially commendable. The Greek troops are acting quickly, often attacking the Italian troops by surprise. Foreign observers in Athens are deeply impressed by the careful wording of the Greek official reports. The Greek authorities are eager to avoid creating an overconfident mood and are asking foreign reporters not to exaggerate Greek victories, as the victory of the Greek army is evident in the facts. (Reuters, 6th)

Ohrid – It is reported that an entire Italian division of 15,000 to 20,000 men is now in dire straits and may be captured by Greek forces. Greek troops in the north, attempting to cut off the Italian retreat, have crossed the Devoll River and are advancing rapidly towards Konko (on the highway from Bilisht to Korçë), pursuing the fleeing Italian troops in front. Greek artillery is bombarding Italian positions in the Korçë area from the high mountains overlooking the highway. The report also said that Greek heavy artillery and Italian forces fought fiercely in the Pogradec area. As a result, the Greek army advanced with great force. In this battle, the Greek army suffered seven dead and thirty wounded. The Italian army suffered thirty-five dead and one hundred and fifty wounded. Three tanks and a large amount of military supplies were captured. Greek anti-aircraft artillery shot down an Italian bomber from the famous A-wing near Pogradec. Also, Greek forces advanced along a branch road leading to the small lake, assisted by light tanks and mechanized units, and occupied the village of Sagrada. In the battle on Monday night, 40 Italian soldiers and 2 officers were captured, and three tanks were captured. The Greek troops in the north, who crossed the Devoll River, are now advancing towards the highway from Bilisht to Korçë, attempting to meet with another Greek army that has reached that road. If this is successful, the Italian army will inevitably be in dire straits. (United Press, 6th)

### World Sympathy for Greek Resistance, British Troops Continue to Land on Greek Islands

New York – It is reported here that British troops, in addition to landing on Crete, have also landed on the Greek islands of Mytilene and Chios (in the Aegean Sea) and Kythira (between Crete and mainland Greece). (Reuters, 6th)

Athens – Several British Air Force officers have arrived in Athens and joined the military mission led by Major General Palairet. At the same time, foreign nationals in Greece are now trying to join the Greek army as volunteers. The famous Greek Evzones, all wearing skirts, were the first to go into battle and have now become heroes in the eyes of everyone. Armed only with rifles, bayonets, and hand grenades, they often attack Italian tank convoys and force them to retreat. The public is automatically donating huge sums of money for the war effort, and goodwill telegrams are pouring in from all over the world like snowflakes. (Reuters, 5th)

### Impasse in the Invasion of Greece, Rumors of Italy Seeking Aid from Germany Again

Rome – The Piccolo newspaper reported yesterday that in the war in Greece, the Greek army has adopted mobile tactics, causing unexpected difficulties for the Italian army. Italian officers and soldiers feel that it is difficult to cope with. (Hai Tong News Agency)

London – Reuters diplomatic correspondent said that Italian official reports claim that the weather is unfavorable and the Italian army cannot advance, but the Greek army is still advancing fiercely today and is not stopping due to the climate, which is strange. Greek sources say that they have stormed and captured several mountains and captured many prisoners. Regardless of whether the Greek war reports are reliable, one thing is clear: after a week of fighting, the Italian army has not achieved anything against the Greek defenses. All it has done is adopt Nazi methods, bombing undefended city areas and intimidating civilians. Germany has not yet pressured Turkey to take actions to support Italy. If there had been proper cooperation between the Axis powers, Germany should have taken action against Bulgaria or Turkey. Many sources say that Italy was dissatisfied with Hitler's compromise with the Vichy government and launched an attack on Greece. Now, the lack of coordination between Germany and Italy makes the Franco-German rift not without reason. Mussolini now sees that the Greek problem is not as simple as he expected and is likely to seek help from Germany. This can be seen from Foreign Minister Ciano's sudden visit to German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. (Reuters, 6th)

Rome – An intelligence meeting here announced yesterday that the Italian-Greek conflict could only end if Greece stopped resisting or Italy stopped military operations. According to the Belgrade newspaper "Politika," Germany and Greece are currently conducting diplomatic talks, aimed at persuading Greece to accept the demands in the Italian ultimatum in order to stop the conflict.

### Bombs Dropped on Yugoslav Border Town by Mysterious Aircraft, Nationality of Intruding Aircraft Not Yet Determined, Yugoslavia Adopts Stern Measures to Ensure Security

Bitola, Yugoslavia – Italian bombers dropped a large number of bombs on this town in neutral Yugoslavia yesterday. Yesterday happened to be market day in the town, and people gathered in the streets, causing panic among the crowd. The town is located at the southernmost end of the country. The Italian aircraft mistakenly thought it was the Greek town of Florina, 20 kilometers south of here. After this incident, the Yugoslav military authorities immediately ordered all lights in the town to be turned off at night, and half of the 33,000 residents of the town have been evacuated. The Italian consul stationed here immediately telephoned the Italian Embassy in Yugoslavia, asking if the consul should leave the country. The reply was that Italian planes would not come again. During the first air raid yesterday, a total of three Italian aircraft dropped twenty-three bombs, killing two people and injuring five. The second raid came at 2:40 PM, dropping more bombs, killing seven people and injuring thirty. Twelve bombs landed near the railway station, four at the airfield, two next to the barracks, and two in the city center. One of them landed near a hotel. The bombs dropped in the second air raid were all huge 150-kilogram bombs, which exploded extremely violently, leaving huge craters in the ground. Experts believe that the aircraft were "Fiat BR.20" military aircraft, and they came and went from the south. It is believed that they came from the Korçë airfield. In addition, the most bomb explosions occurred near the railway station and the headquarters of the Yugoslav Army Division. Six bombs also hit next to an anti-aircraft shelter, but the losses were not significant. The streets were almost filled with broken glass. The bomb craters in the ground were up to 18 feet deep, mostly near the railway station and the barracks. Three people were killed within 40 yards of the United Press office (in a hotel in the city). The reporter's room was filled with broken glass and bomb fragments. (United Press, 6th)

Belgrade, Yugoslavia – The Yugoslav government issued an official report last night stating that between 1:45 PM and 3:10 PM yesterday afternoon, several foreign aircraft dropped twenty-one bombs on the Yugoslav town of Bitola, of which nineteen exploded immediately, killing nine people and injuring twenty-one. There was extensive property damage. The Yugoslav government immediately took stern measures to prevent the recurrence of this violation of Yugoslav territory and to ensure national security. The Italian ambassador to Yugoslavia called on Yugoslav Prime Minister Simović yesterday afternoon, stating that the aircraft were not Italian aircraft. At the same time, the Greek ambassador also assured the Yugoslav government that they were definitely not Greek aircraft. People here believe that this matter was due to a misunderstanding. (Hai Tong News Agency, 6th)

Belgrade, Yugoslavia – After Italian aircraft dropped bombs on the Yugoslav border town of Bitola, the Yugoslav cabinet convened an emergency meeting.

Officials said that stern steps would be taken to prevent the recurrence of such incidents. It is said that a committee of experts has been appointed to identify the country of the offending aircraft. Once the nationality is identified, the Yugoslav government will take appropriate action. Italian officials here said that the aircraft that bombed Bitola, according to a report from the Italian consul there, had Greek markings on them. (United Press, 6th)

### Spanish Army Chief Inspects Troops in North Africa: Encourages Soldiers to be Ready for Battle; Annexation of Tangier Almost a Prelude to Joining the War

General Valera, the Spanish Army Chief of the Canary Islands, came to the Canary Islands to inspect the troops. He recently gave a speech here, saying, "When Chief of State Franco deems the time is ripe and issues military orders, all comrades will have only one political goal: to lead Spain towards its historical destiny. Recall that Chief of State Franco led the army from these islands in July 1936 to overthrow the Republican government and ultimately achieved final victory. Upon my return to the capital, I will report to Chief of State Franco that you are ready for battle, and the spirit of your brave fighting when the military order is given will surely be demonstrated again." (Havas, 5th)

Casablanca, Morocco: The Tangier International Zone was taken over by Spanish troops on Monday. Under the command of Colonel Yeste, the Spanish troops deployed artillery positions at various strongholds in the Tangier International Zone, and then issued a proclamation stating that the Tangier International Zone had been restored as a Spanish city. Separate notifications were sent to the diplomatic envoys of various countries in the zone, stating that the international nature of the zone had ended. The so-called diplomatic missions included representatives of the United States and other signatory countries who were stationed in the Tangier International Zone. As a result of this merger by the two countries, the International Joint Management Committee and the legislature were terminated. After Spain annexed Tangier, the first thing it did was to set the silver coins of the two countries as the standard currency. In the past, the pound sterling and the US dollar were the officially prescribed weights and measures in the zone. American authorities only stated that they would remain in Tangier for a few days, and nothing was known about the reaction in Washington, especially whether the ships sailing from New York to Tangier would change their routes. Tangier is the last international joint management zone in the Mediterranean where American ships can sail directly. Some Tangier residents are convinced that Spain's annexation of Tangier this time is the result of a meeting between Hitler and Franco, and this action may be a preliminary indication of Spain's participation in the European "New Order." However, the most noteworthy aspect of this action is Tangier's strategic position, which is located on the opposite shore of Gibraltar. (United Press, 6th)

### German Planes Raid London All Night: Longest Duration Ever; British Air Force Also Bombs Germany

London: The length of time London experienced last night was unprecedented. According to the Ministry of Aviation, German planes bombed the UK yesterday on a small scale.

### British Foreign Secretary Reports on the Diplomatic Situation: Expresses Understanding of France's Situation; British-Turkish Ties Unshakable

London: Foreign Secretary Halifax gave a speech in the House of Lords last night on the current diplomatic situation, expressing sympathy and understanding for Marshal Pétain's difficulties. However, he said that regardless of what Marshal Pétain hopes to gain by leading France down the path of cooperating with Germany, we cannot believe that a government led by an honorable figure like Marshal Pétain will lead France down the path of harming its former allies. The enemy has repeatedly proposed measures that are detrimental to France, and we have rejected them all. The Foreign Secretary also said that we now have reason to be excited about the air war situation. In the past twelve weeks, the enemy has lost 2,433 bombers and fighters, and 6,000 airmen. In addition, there are many enemy planes that did not return to their original defenses or crashed and were damaged when returning to their defenses. The Foreign Secretary then expressed his warm admiration for Prime Minister Metaxas and the Greek army, and also mentioned Turkey, saying that the ties between Britain and Turkey are strong and unbreakable. Our confidence in Turkey is the same as Turkey's confidence in Britain. As for the British-Egyptian relationship, it is also close and harmonious, and the Egyptian government has fulfilled its treaty obligations. (Reuters, 6th)

All cities and factories will celebrate together. Countless Soviet people will express their love for their motherland and their loyalty to Leninism-Stalinism. The past year has been a year of construction in the Soviet Union, but disputes have arisen in the capitalist world. The Second Imperialist War is currently expanding, and new countries and peoples are being drawn into the war. The Soviet Union continues its policy of peace and has never participated in the war. Stalin's foresight has completely revealed the conspiracies of our enemies. Stalin's wise policies have further enhanced the security of our motherland. In the past few years, the Soviet Union has further strengthened its border defenses, especially national defense in the Northwest. In the past year, the Soviet Union has become a federation of sixteen republics. Soviet power has been established in the three Baltic countries, and the people of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina have also been liberated from oppression. In short, the Soviet Union has become a strong country, and its power in international politics has also increased. All these achievements have aroused the hatred of the enemy. They have not yet abandoned their conspiracy to undermine the Soviet Union's peaceful construction and drag us into the war. Countless Soviet people are committed to strengthening our country's national defense and economic strength, so as to protect the continued development of culture and science. The Communist Party government and Stalin are paying attention to the training of the army. Under Stalin's efforts, there have been major changes in the training methods of the Red Army. The recent Red Army and Navy exercises have demonstrated the achievements in this area." (TASS, 6th)

### Churchill Reports to the House of Commons: War is Favorable to Britain; Still Maintains Absolute Superiority in the Sea and Air; Will Fully Assist Greece After the Invasion

London: Prime Minister Churchill reported on the war amid frequent cheers in the House of Commons last night. First, he spoke about the war in the British sky, saying:

### Air Force Loss Ratio

Two months ago, I said that the ratio of enemy planes lost to British planes lost was three to one, and the ratio of pilots lost was six to one. To this day, in terms of total time, what I said about the ratio of planes lost can be said to be correct. As for the ratio of pilots lost, what I said is also not much different. Judging from the loss of well-trained bomber crew members by the enemy, the enemy's loss of strength is ten times that of ours. Therefore, judging from the results we have obtained, my previous estimates were still too low. Since the enemy has lost so much, and our production of planes and crew members, including British territory and the United States, has increased so rapidly, this is indeed the quickest way to obtain the air superiority necessary for our security and to achieve final victory. (Cheers) Looking at the overall war situation, in the glory and suffering of the war, I have not seen any reason why Hitler can destroy the spirit of the British people by means of bombing our suburbs.

### Heavy Naval Task

There is something more serious than air raids, which is the recent resurgence of German submarines at the entrance to the Atlantic Ocean outside Ireland. We cannot use the southwest coast of Ireland to protect the trade that supports the lives of Ireland and Britain. This fact is a heavy burden on our shoulders that we should not have. In the past month, the strength of the British fleet on patrol has been very weak, because we have to deal with the threat of invading England, maintain a strong fleet in the Mediterranean, and provide full protection for countless merchant ships. The work that our navy has undertaken is so huge, but this period of tension is gradually passing. Fifty American destroyers have quickly joined the team at the time when we need them most, and new ships that were already under construction at the beginning of the war are now being completed one after another. Although the tonnage of our country's merchant ships has lost a lot, it has not decreased compared with the beginning of the war, and most of the neutral ships that have always traded freely with us are now under our control. Our army's search for enemy submarines is still very effective. In the past two or three days, two German submarines were destroyed again in the western sea, and many of their crew members were captured. One of them was the submarine that sank the British Queen. (Cheers)

### Maintain Maritime Traffic

I am confident that the British shipping industry will be able to transport all the necessary food and munitions needed by Britain, but it is expected that submarine attacks next year will be more severe than this year. But we are now prepared. We must be far-sighted in this aspect of the war. We must take into account the merchant ship procedures in 1943 and 1944, so that if the enemy has not surrendered or collapsed by then, we can still maintain maritime traffic. I can tell the House with certainty that we will definitely protect the stability of our mainland. This is my personal opinion without any doubt. (Cheers)

### Strengthening the Army

The British Prime Minister, in speaking about the army, said that the British army is now strong and highly mobile. The failure of the German invasion of Britain is a victory in the history of the central island and a milestone for the British counter-offensive. Britain is still engaged in organizing and training a strong army, and Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and India are also committed to this. If there is no well-trained and great army, the war situation will be protracted or become a stalemate. Even when the threat of a German invasion was imminent, Britain continued to send troops and war materials to Egypt to reinforce, as far as the shipping and transportation capacity allowed. Every month, tens of thousands of soldiers, either from the British Isles or elsewhere in the British Empire, were sent to the Middle East. The strength of the troops on the Egyptian border and in Sudan is now far from as weak as it was when France collapsed. This is what I can assure the House of Commons. The authority of the British fleet in the eastern Mediterranean is gradually restoring the situation caused by the collapse of France, and guaranteeing Turkey that British naval power has not weakened in the slightest. Therefore, the House of Commons should not deny that our current situation, whether on the domestic front or the Mediterranean battlefield, is far better than what the world expected four or five months ago.

### Fulfilling the Obligation to Aid Greece

Now we suddenly encounter a new summons. The Italian dictator, probably annoyed by Laval's flattery of Germany, or with other new plans, is using his usual cold-blooded methods to increase his oppression of the small and unfeeling nation of Greece. Mussolini, without encountering any provocative acts or using the facade of negotiation, has sent troops to Greece, and his planes have massacred Greek civilians in Thessaloniki and other places. The Greek government and people are determined to fight for life and honor. We have carefully avoided any actions that could make Greece an enemy, and Greece has maintained strict neutrality, but Greece has not escaped. Although we are currently occupied with matters at home and in the Middle East, in this environment, there is only one thing we can do: that is, we will do our best. (Cheers) We have now established naval and air force bases on Crete. (Continued cheers) We can now expand the scope of our naval and air force activities. We have begun to attack military targets and bases in southern Italian cities. This kind of war will continue on a larger scale. I would like to tell you that other troops are being mobilized for the purpose of actively assisting Greece. However, I hope the House of Commons will not inquire about the details of the aid to Greece plan. If I say too much, it will raise false hopes. If I don't say enough, it will cause unnecessary panic. If I tell the truth, it will reveal what the enemy wants to know. In short, all I can say is that we will do our best. I am sure the House of Commons will agree with this statement. (Reuters, 6th)

Petition from People of Ji County, Requesting Posthumous Commendation for Geng Mingyuan for His Righteous Sacrifice

Ji County News. Geng Mingyuan, a respected elder of Ji County, was a man of high moral character, fond of doing good deeds, and courageous in defending righteousness. He was deeply loved by the people. Since the county fell into enemy hands in September of the 27th year (1938), he endured hardships and dedicated himself to the country and the people. This time, the Japanese army, dissatisfied with the actions of a certain village in the county, intended to burn it to the ground. For the sake of the lives and property of thousands of fellow countrymen, he stepped forward to plead for the people, hoping to preserve them. As a result, he sacrificed his own life to save the entire village from disaster. His spirit of sacrificing himself for righteousness is truly admirable. It is said that the people of the county have erected a monument in his memory and jointly petitioned the National Government for a posthumous commendation.

### President Roosevelt's Family History

Roosevelt was elected for the third time yesterday, and his re-election as President of the United States is truly an auspicious sign unprecedented in American history. Speaking superstitiously, although it is due to his own good fortune and successful old age, it is not entirely unrelated to the merits accumulated by his ancestors and the good fortune of his birth chart! Just a joke.

If we were to imitate biographical writing, the opening sentences should perhaps say: "Roosevelt, whose ancestors were Dutch farmers, the lineage of which is long and difficult to trace. In the 17th century, his great-great-grandfather moved from the village of Roosevelt to New Amsterdam. Because there was no family name, he took the village name as his surname..."

In fact, from President Roosevelt's great-grandfather onwards, genealogical records are clearly documented. To say that the deeds of his ancestors are lost is only because the era is long and there are no records to be found.

Now, let's start with the two generations before Roosevelt's grandfather: Isaac Roosevelt, born in 1726, was the great-grandfather of the current President of the United States, Franklin Roosevelt. He started his business in the industrial sector, founded New York's first sugar factory, refined sugar and made sweet wine, accumulating considerable wealth. Because he had a great position in the business world, he was also the president of New York's first bank, "Bank of New York." In addition to business, he also engaged in a political career, serving as a member of the New York State Assembly.

His son James, President Roosevelt's great-grandfather, not only benefited from his ancestors' legacy but also excelled at manipulating oddities and seeking profit, leaving no stone unturned in his pursuit of land and property. He once owned 400 acres of farmland on Manhattan Island in New York, which is now the most magnificent Fifth Avenue to the East River in New York City. He also, like his father, worked as a New York banker.

Roosevelt's grandfather, also named Isaac, initially studied medicine. Because he was too compassionate, he kept moving his family, eventually settling down in Hyde Park near the Hudson River. Because he did not engage in production, his family's wealth was far less than that of his father and grandfather. Fortunately, good people have good sons. President Roosevelt's father, also named James, was shrewd and capable, and restored the family's reputation. He was the "lord" of the Roosevelt family's revival.

He was devoted to Mountainism and was an advanced member of the Democratic Party. The son of a great family, President Roosevelt can be said to be able to carry on the ambitions of his predecessors. In business, he was also a resourceful and skilled merchant. He invested his wealth in the railway industry and also served as an executive in the Delaware and Hudson Railway Company. Because his family was wealthy, his life was rich and comfortable. He always traveled to Europe every year for leisure and recreation. He loved all kinds of sports competitions, especially horse racing. He built a new residence several miles away from the old residence in Hyde Park, spending his leisurely years and passing away in 1900.

James married twice. His first wife, Rebecca Howland, was the daughter of a wealthy New York merchant. Her father made a fortune trading with China and had one son, nicknamed "Rosey," who was President Roosevelt's brother. His second wife was Sarah Delano, President Roosevelt's mother. In 1880, she met James at a banquet for Theodore Roosevelt. They fell in love at first sight and soon got married. At that time, Sarah was 26 years old and James was 52 years old. Two years later, President Roosevelt was born.

President Roosevelt's mother is now 85 years old and still very energetic. Her father, President Roosevelt's maternal grandfather, Warren Delano, lost his fortune accumulated through trade with China in the 1857 economic crisis and returned to Hong Kong to resume his old business. He took his entire family, old and young, on a long sea voyage. In addition to the couple, seven children, both boys and girls, took the "Surprise" clipper ship, rounding the Cape of Good Hope to China, and arrived at their destination after 125 days at sea. President Roosevelt's mother was quite famous for her beauty in her youth. After marrying James, the old husband and young wife enjoyed the happiness of harmony. When President Roosevelt was born, it was an extraordinary addition of splendor, and the couple loved him like a treasure, never letting him out of their sight before the age of fourteen.

"Rosey" Roosevelt, President Roosevelt's older brother, was a natural-born pleasure-seeker. He married Helen Astor, the daughter of a millionaire. "Rosey" was truly fond of the pleasures of the flesh. He was a typical gentleman of elegance and luxury at that time. Unfortunately, his first wife died early, and he remarried Elizabeth Riley, a beautiful woman from England. She now lives near Hyde Park and often visits the Roosevelts because they live so close. "Rosey" had one son and one daughter. The daughter, Helen, married Robison. The son, James Roosevelt, inherited his mother's Astor family fortune and has an uncle who is the President. He now lives in seclusion in "Kew Gardens" in New York. He is most enthusiastic about the Salvation Army's work.

President Roosevelt was born into a wealthy family and was loved by his parents since childhood, so he naturally enjoyed everything, which cannot be compared with the children of scholarly families. As for education, that was even less of a problem. In 1905, he married Eleanor Roosevelt, and the couple were very compatible. The First Lady studied in England in her early years and was very talented. After marrying Roosevelt, she took care of her husband and children and became a typical American housewife. However, her appearance was quite ordinary. When she was a child, her mother told her to study hard so that she could become a virtuous wife and good mother in the future. She knew that if she relied solely on her appearance, she might not find a suitable husband.

President Roosevelt's mother-in-law was a very beautiful lady. In New York society, besides Mrs. Astor, who was famous for her beauty, she was the second most beautiful woman. Her photograph was cherished by aesthetic experts who loved to collect portraits of beautiful women. President Roosevelt's father-in-law, Edward Roosevelt, was originally an athlete who loved hunting, but unfortunately, he was addicted to alcohol and was not very successful in his later years. He passed away in 1894. His brother, President Roosevelt's uncle-in-law, Theodore Roosevelt, was very prestigious in politics. He served as the 26th President of the United States.

When President Roosevelt was five years old, he was taken to the White House by his parents and met with the then President Cleveland. President Cleveland said to Roosevelt, "Young man, I suddenly have a strange idea... I hope you will never be President in your life." Who knew that this young man would now be President for the third time in a row? If Cleveland knew in the afterlife, he would laugh in astonishment.

Note: Yesterday's "Painful History of the European War" translation illustration in this newspaper was the scene of the last farewell between British Prime Minister Churchill and French Premier Reynaud. This is hereby clarified.

### Roosevelt's Election Victory: Shanghai Business Community Overjoyed, Believing Aid to China Will Become More Active, Maintaining Consistent Policy of Resisting Violence, American Community Watched Voting Developments All Day Yesterday

The US election that has attracted worldwide attention has been announced yesterday, and it has been revealed that Mr. Roosevelt will continue to serve as the next US President. As a result, foreign nationals of democratic countries and the Chinese side in this city have expressed enthusiastic satisfaction and congratulated Mr. Roosevelt unanimously. It is believed that during his re-election term, whether in the Far East or in Europe, he will adopt a strong policy against aggression and safeguard the rights of the United States. It is deeply believed that Mr. Roosevelt will be able to provide China with greater assistance in the future. It is recalled that on the 26th of last month, Hull made a statement to the American national newspapers, acknowledging that the armed aggression of the totalitarian countries has shown that the United States can no longer superstitiously believe in its own unreliable security and the untrustworthy promises of dictators. Only by continuing to more actively assist China and the United Kingdom can it seek self-defense and survival. This is a promise from the United States to all countries that love justice, peace, and freedom in the world. After Mr. Roosevelt's quick appointment, there is no doubt that he will put it into practice.

Great Comfort to Chinese and Foreigners

Since the news of Roosevelt's election victory arrived in Shanghai last night, the attitude of the majority of Chinese and foreign residents in this port has been one of joy. The American community was telling each other, "I told you so!" Few businessmen went to the office yesterday afternoon, and most of them gathered in hotels, clubs, and bars to talk about the results of this election. At the same time, foreign telegrams and wireless telegraphs continuously reported the progress of the US voting to this port, attracting great attention from Chinese and foreign people. It was also heard that there were three people in the office of the US Bailiff's Office in this port, who were local lawyers, clerks, and enforcement officers. Their positions were closely related to the results of yesterday's election. If Mr. Roosevelt had been defeated, they would have advanced and retreated with him. According to US Bailiff Hamilick, it was the right decision for the American people to elect Roosevelt to be re-elected in these turbulent times. The famous American lawyer Fankeling declared yesterday that he had long expected Roosevelt to win and had repeatedly made this prediction to people. Another American lawyer, Aleman, said that the American citizens' voting was very wise. Roosevelt's policy is to protect the interests of the United States in the Far East. He is convinced that this policy will continue to be implemented.

Far East Policy Will Become Stronger

According to an observer on the Chinese side, President Roosevelt's re-election is of great importance to China, because President Roosevelt has always advocated aiding China and restraining Japan. His policy has become more active in recent months. Now that he has been re-elected, it means that his policy has won the enthusiastic support of an absolute majority of the American people, so he can now fully implement his ideas. It can be seen that the US Far East policy will become more active and firm. Although Mr. Wilkie has also stated that if he is elected, he will also assist China, the Republican Party has a strong tendency to isolationism, and whether Mr. Wilkie's promise can be realized is questionable. Even if it can be implemented, it is not as thorough as Roosevelt, who is deeply aware of the situation in the Far East. Because Mr. Roosevelt has realized from his many years of experience that unless the policy of appeasement in the Far East is terminated and China is actively assisted, the interests of the United States in the Far East cannot be protected. For himself and for others, he cannot but provide greater assistance to China. Moreover, Mr. Roosevelt has been in power for eight years, and he can handle everything with ease. At this time of treacherous world affairs, he can especially cope with it comfortably. Therefore, the American people, in order to maintain their consistent national policy and deal with violence, have this result. It is expected that the relationship between China and the United States will become closer in the future, and the actions of the United States in the Far East will also become stronger.

American Community in This City Extremely Concerned

According to the English "Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury," the American community in this city is extremely interested in the presidential election of their country, which has not happened in previous elections. Yesterday morning, the first news about the voting arrived in Shanghai, stating that according to informal statistics, President Roosevelt was slightly ahead of his political enemy Wilkie in fourteen states. The American community in this city had different views on this result. Those who supported Wilkie expressed satisfaction with this obvious fact, saying that President Roosevelt would not get twice the unexpected number of votes as he did in the 1936 election. As a result, those who supported Roosevelt felt that Roosevelt's election was not very certain. Later, at ten o'clock yesterday morning, the second news arrived in Shanghai, stating that Roosevelt had gained an advantage in twenty-seven states in the United States and would defeat Wilkie with 65 electoral votes. Those who supported Roosevelt were greatly encouraged. From the attitudes of people from all walks of life in Shanghai, it was clear that those who sympathized with Roosevelt were in the absolute majority. Before 11:00 a.m. yesterday morning, those who supported Wilkie received news that according to informal statistics, Roosevelt had 187 electoral votes, while Wilkie had 141. Roosevelt had an advantage in eighteen states, while Wilkie also had an advantage in twelve states. The two sides were evenly matched, and there was not much difference. Wilkie could have a chance to win. After 11:00 a.m., when the news was received here that Roosevelt could get 219 electoral votes, while his political enemy could only get 88 electoral votes, and that the Democratic Party had an advantage in 19 of the 28 states, it was felt that Wilkie had no hope of being elected.

Mock Voting: Roosevelt Wins

The General Federation of American Women in this city held a mock presidential election at the clubhouse on the afternoon of the 5th (the previous day). As a result, Roosevelt won a great victory, with 40 votes, while Wilkie only got 20 votes. In her 20-minute speech, Mrs. Parsons, a supporter of Roosevelt, enumerated the benefits of Roosevelt's rule, especially paying attention to how the "New Deal" created relief organizations and established unemployment insurance and pensions. Mrs. Parsons said that Roosevelt's government has always been concerned with the greatest interests of the greatest number of people. Mr. Roosevelt's foreign policy is characterized by advocating world peace, supplemented by aid to democratic countries except for participation in the war. At the same time, he has unified the countries of South America. Mrs. Parsons continued to say that the biggest difference between Roosevelt and Wilkie is that Wilkie lacks experience, because Wilkie has never held office, while Roosevelt has been a successful leader in the past eight years. Mrs. Sheliff passionately defended Wilkie and pointed out the shortcomings of Roosevelt. Finally, the women in the audience voted to resolve the matter. Several British women were also present as observers at that time.

British Expatriates Warmly Welcome

After obtaining Roosevelt's victory, the Pingming News reporter first inquired about the opinions of the British official in Shanghai, but he said that he did not want to express his opinion in his position. However, the authoritative figures of the British community in this port expressed a warm welcome to President Roosevelt's election victory. The reason is that with the European war in full swing, Roosevelt's continued election victory will make the relationship between Britain and the United States closer and will be realized quickly. The reason is that Roosevelt has repeatedly clarified his attitude, maintaining the status quo and peace of the world, and opposing the aggressive behavior of the Axis powers.

### Soviet Revolution Anniversary Celebrations to be Held for Five Days Starting Today

Today is the 23rd anniversary of the Soviet October Revolution. Soviet expatriates here will hold a dance party at the American Women's Federation on Jing'an Temple Road for five days. This grand event was initiated by the Shanghai Soviet Expatriate Federation and invited Latvian, Lithuanian, and Estonian expatriates to participate in the celebration together. However, Soviet diplomats have already left, so there will be no diplomatic reception ceremony. The dance party will be held from 9:00 p.m. today and will feature the screening of the Soviet film "Great Award" and the 1918 Lenin film. The Soviet Expatriate Association also invited White Russians in this city to participate, but the White Russians will go to the White Russian church today to pray in mourning. The October Revolution is also the anniversary of the establishment of the Soviet government, the Bolshevik Revolution.

### Plague Discovered in Ningbo, Confirmed by Laboratory Tests, Over Twenty Deaths, Shanghai and Ningbo are Closely Connected, Worthy of Great Attention

Recently, a plague has suddenly been discovered in Ningbo, and the situation is very serious. Plague is a statutory infectious disease with the most severe epidemic nature. All countries in the world regard this disease as a flood and fierce beast. Shanghai and Ningbo are closely connected and deserve great attention. The Datong News reporter has recorded the details as follows:

Plague Discovered

According to Datong News reporter's investigation, the plague in Ningbo was discovered on the 30th of last month, and the area is in the Donghou Street area of Kaiming Bridge in the city. More than 20 people have died one after another. After the local government agencies discovered it, they immediately sealed off the traffic in that section to isolate it. At the same time, a temporary isolation hospital and an epidemic prevention office were set up. All houses in the epidemic area were fumigated to eradicate rat fleas.

Laboratory Test Confirmed

All theaters in the Ningbo urban area have also stopped performing to prevent those infected from mixing in and spreading the epidemic. At the same time, the provincial government was requested to send a health team to Ningbo to assist in the suppression. The blood of the infected has been tested by the Ningbo Huamei Hospital. The blood vessels were injected into the abdomen of a Dutch rat. As a result, the rat died in less than 24 hours. Therefore, there is no doubt that it is a real plague.

Traffic Blockaded

The Yin County government issued a special announcement saying that since the 30th of last month, a plague has been discovered in Kaiming Street in Dongzhen, Tangda Town, and Donghou Street in this county, and the spread is very serious. In three days, nearly 20 people have died without treatment. The plague area is located in a bustling area. If it is not suppressed as soon as possible, it will be irreversible. Now, together with the Ningbo Police Department, the following areas are designated as the sealed-off and implemented prevention areas. No entry or exit is allowed in the epidemic area. It is related to the epidemic policy. I hope all people will strictly abide by it. Plague sealed-off areas: (1) Zhongshan East Road - Kaiming Street to Tai Niu Alley; (2) Kaiming Street - Zhongshan East Road to Guandi Alley; (3) Taiping Alley - Zhongshan East Road to Donghou Street.

### Venerable Rongzeng Bestows Two Initiations, Today Burns Offerings for Protection, Will Enter Seclusion to Practice Dharma After the Ceremony

The bronze statue opening ceremony of the Panchen Lama, held by Venerable Rongzeng, originally scheduled for eighteen days of thousand-lamp offerings, was extended for two days due to numerous requests, which were difficult to refuse, and will conclude today. In the past two days, Venerable Rongzeng bestowed the initiation of the longevity Dharma and the four-armed Guanyin Dharma. According to Tantric Buddhist custom, those who receive the initiation should make offerings to the initiating Dharma master. Venerable Rongzeng deeply embodies compassion, selflessness, and equality, and does not accept offerings, uniformly performing green liquid initiations. The attendance was unprecedentedly large. Today's burning offerings for protection is an even grander ceremony. This was held once in Shanghai last year during the Great White Umbrella Benefit Dharma Assembly and is not often encountered, so those who go to watch the ceremony today will be even more crowded. Venerable Rongzeng plans to enter a long-term retreat after this Dharma assembly to practice the great Dharma and to recuperate. In the future, he will still focus on promoting Buddhism, expounding Tibetan Tantra, and translating scriptures. As for the bronze statue expenses, they all come from the Venerable's usual accumulated offerings, but if believers donate on their own, there is Mr. Wang from Beiping donating 1,000 yuan, and Mr. Tang donating 100 yuan.

### Coolidge Ship Returns to US This Morning; Over Two Hundred Shanghai Residents Depart

The US government has advised its citizens in the Far East to return home. The first group of American citizens evacuated from this city departed from Shanghai the day before yesterday (the 4th) morning aboard the government-designated special ship, the "Mount Vernon." Additionally, the President Coolidge, a postal ship of the American President Lines, returned from Little Luzon, passing through Hong Kong to Shanghai on its way back to the United States. It arrived in port on Tuesday (the 5th) afternoon, docking at buoys 11 and 12. It is reported that there were as many as 629 passengers on board returning to the US from Luzon and Hong Kong. The above information has been reported in previous newspapers. It is now known that the ship is scheduled to set sail this morning at 4:00 AM, again passing through Kobe, Yokohama, Honolulu, and San Francisco before returning to Los Angeles. There are also 212 passengers from this city returning to their home country on this ship. In total, there are about 850 passengers returning from the Far East. It is reported that Mrs. Hepburn, wife of Admiral Hepburn, Commander-in-Chief of the US Naval Asiatic Fleet, and her daughter are also returning home on this ship. Therefore, most of them are evacuated citizens. The second special ship, the Mariposa, is on its way to Shanghai. There is no definite information on the date and time of its arrival in Shanghai, but the date of its return to the US has been set for this Sunday (the 10th).

### Winter Approaching: Charities Solicit Donations

Women and Children's Association: The fundraising committee of the China Women and Children's Relief Association yesterday issued a public notice, stating, "The China Women and Children's Relief Association was founded in the third year of Xuantong (1911), and has been dedicated to rescuing lost and abducted women and children for nearly thirty years, numbering over ten thousand people. However, our association has always lacked funds, struggling to maintain its operations year after year. The January 28th Incident almost brought it to a halt. Unexpectedly, the war has started again. The Jiangwan Nursing Home of our association was directly affected, and the buildings and movable property were all destroyed. Since relocating to Shanghai, work has continued as usual, with the number of women and children in care increasing rather than decreasing. At a time when everything is expensive, there is not enough clothing or food, and the situation is extremely difficult. We have always admired those who are enthusiastic about charity and have a spirit of universal love. Therefore, we are respectfully presenting donation forms, earnestly requesting generous donations or promoting fundraising to support this good cause together. Please send donations to No. 422, Xingye Building, Jiangxi Road, Beijing Road, telephone 14303, so that this only national women and children's relief organization can last forever, which would truly be a great merit."

Scrap Cloth Guild: The Shanghai Scrap Cloth Trade Association yesterday convened a meeting of all member representatives to discuss fundraising for winter clothing. The meeting was first addressed by Chairman Wang Wenhan, who explained the purpose of soliciting donations for winter clothing. Executive Committee member Deng Deqing then distributed signature forms to each representative for donation pledges. A sum of one thousand yuan was raised on the spot. Members unable to attend, numbering over fifty, will be approached individually by designated personnel to solicit donations.

Chinese Women's Association: The Chinese Women's Association's relief group, in view of the large number of refugees in Shanghai and the increasingly cold weather, with many refugees lacking adequate clothing, has issued lottery tickets. A total of 3,000 lottery tickets have been issued, each selling for two yuan in national currency. The first prize is a twelve-lamp floor-standing wireless radio from a famous American manufacturer, which is quite valuable and is currently displayed in the window of Wing On Company. The second and third prizes are also valuable items. All proceeds from the lottery will be used for refugee winter clothing expenses. In addition to sales by members, the Wing On Company gift certificate department is also selling the lottery tickets. It is reported that all the tickets will be sold out soon, so the public should purchase them as soon as possible and not miss the opportunity. It is also reported that the lottery will be drawn publicly at the association's office at 2:00 PM on November 11th, regardless of whether all tickets are sold out, and will not be postponed.

### Elderly Woman Sues for Deceased Sister's Inheritance; Developments in the Trial; Defendant Arrested While Being Summoned for Questioning; Plaintiff's Identity Long Debated by Both Parties

Wang Zhang Zaihua, a wealthy widow from Pudong, had a husband, the late Wang Yonglin, whose first wife, Xie, had a son named Mingji, who died long ago, leaving behind one son and one daughter: a son named Jingren and a daughter named Ningwa. Yonglin's concubine, Cheng, had a son and a daughter: a son named Yizhi and a daughter named Zhengan, who is married with the surname Gu. Zhang was Yonglin's second wife, and although she had no children of her own, the couple had a good relationship. Therefore, Zhang possessed a considerable amount of private property. After Yonglin died of illness last year, Zhang managed the estate, worth 500,000 yuan. Later, when Zhang died of illness, the entire estate of Yonglin and Zhang was divided among Wang Yizhi, Wang Jingren, and others. Zhang's elder sister, Zhang Zaihe (70 years old this year), recently appointed lawyer Huang Qingyuan to file a lawsuit with the First Special Court's Civil Division, in accordance with Article 1138, Paragraph 2 of the Civil Code, against Wang Yizhi, Wang Jingren, Wang Ningwa, Wang Zhengan, and others, requesting confirmation that Wang Zhang's exclusive property, worth nearly 100,000 yuan, should be inherited solely by the plaintiff. It was argued that Wang Zhang had no blood relatives, and only the plaintiff and Wang Zhang were sisters, and should be allowed to inherit according to the law. At the same time, Zhang Zaihe also demanded to analyze one-quarter of Wang Yonglin's entire estate. After the court received the lawsuit, Judge Tao summoned the case for trial. The defendant Wang Yizhi's attorney requested an out-of-court settlement, and the court ordered a postponement of the trial. On the date set for the trial yesterday, there was a major complication. Wang Wu Fengli (22 years old, from Shanghai, residing at No. 2, Yude Lane, Xicang Road, Nanshi), the wife of the defendant Wang Jingren, submitted a statement to the First Special Court the day before yesterday, stating:

"The defendant Wang Jingren is the petitioner's husband. Wang Jingren was summoned for trial in this case on the morning of the 6th of this month. For his own benefit, he should have appeared in court himself or appointed an attorney to respond to the lawsuit. Unexpectedly, on the morning of October 26th of this year, Wang Jingren was arrested in Nanshi while carrying documents and pleadings related to various cases, preparing to leave home to submit them. He was arrested on the grounds that Wang Jingren had embezzled part of the estate of Wang Yonglin and his wife. He was detained and forbidden from communicating with others, making it difficult for Wang Jingren to answer questions and submit documents. Moreover, he has not appointed lawyer Gao Danhua to represent him," etc. After receiving the statement, Judge Tao continued to preside over the trial of the case yesterday. Huang Jiyuan, the attorney for the plaintiff Sheng Zhang Zaihe, requested that this case and Wang Zhengan's estate dispute case be consolidated for trial. The court discussed and waited for verification. Wang Yizhi's appointed attorney, Xi Yuchang, and others appeared in court. Shen Xingxia, the attorney for Wang Ningwa, also arrived. Xi Yuchang and others raised objections to the plaintiff's identity. The two parties debated for a long time. The court discussed and adjourned the trial to the 27th of this month.

### Norwegian Consul General Returns to Shanghai from Manila

Mr. T. Knudtjon, the Norwegian Consul General in Shanghai, returned to Shanghai from Manila on the President Coolidge postal ship the day before yesterday. He has resumed his duties after being absent. However, all government affairs of the Norwegian Consulate General are still handled in accordance with the orders of the Norwegian government, which has relocated to London, and close contact is maintained.

### Chinese Constable Robbed of Handgun While on Guard Duty

Constable No. 307, a Chinese constable on guard duty at the entrance of No. 22 Foch Road in the French Concession, was suddenly confronted by four bandits at around 9:15 PM last night. The bandits brandished handguns. Two bandits grabbed the constable around the waist, preventing him from making a sound, and forcibly took away his official handgun and six bullets. The bandits then fled into the darkness of the Chinese territory and disappeared without a trace.

### Grain Store Manager Accused of Breach of Trust and Embezzlement

Shen Tongchang, from Pinghu, 31 years old, worked as a manager at the Sanfeng Grain Store at No. 9, Lane 274, Route Cardinal Foch, earning a monthly salary of 110 yuan. Since his employment, he had been loyal to his duties. However, his attitude suddenly changed recently. In mid-July of this year, he used 6,500 yuan of store funds to purchase broad beans in Pinghu. After selling them a few days later, he made a profit of over 2,000 yuan. Subsequently, on August 30, he sold 140 bags of Siamese rice to the Shen Huichang store at a low price and also gave 1,300 burlap sacks to Mr. Shen. This situation was considered a breach of trust. Shareholder representative Wu Liangren reported the information to the French police, who arrested Shen and sent him to the Second Criminal Division of the Second Special Court. Police lawyer Fei Xizhen prosecuted him for breach of trust under Article 242. According to the defendant's confession, the plaintiff's accusation was a misunderstanding. Therefore, a civil lawsuit was attached, and the two parties have reached a settlement and appointed lawyer Zhu Yongkang to defend him. After verifying the statements in court, the hearing was adjourned to the 15th. The defendant was detained.

### He Shaoting's Two Sons Kidnapped and Returned Home Safely

He Shaoting, a local contractor residing at No. 84 Route Paul Beau, has considerable assets. His two sons, one 16 years old and the other 19 years old, are both students. On the 2nd of this month, they were suddenly kidnapped by bandits and hidden in western Shanghai. Over the past few days, the family received letters from the bandits demanding a large ransom before they would release the children. At around 6:00 PM yesterday, the two children colluded with the bandits guarding them and took the opportunity to escape, returning home in haste.

### Lawyer Sun Jie, Who Fails to Appear in Court, Faces Disciplinary Action

Lawyer Sun Jie initially promoted himself as a lawyer who does not appear in court, advertising extensively in newspapers and advocating for the creation of non-litigation movements. This caused considerable controversy. The Shanghai Bar Association believed that this action by the member was detrimental to the ethics of lawyers and requested the Second Branch of the High Court's Procuratorate to take disciplinary action. It is now heard that the Procuratorate of the court has legally initiated disciplinary proceedings.

### Coppersmith Starts Business with Loan, Loses Everything in Gambling

Huang Pengkang, a young man from Haimen, 20 years old, was a coppersmith. Recently, he borrowed and raised 1,600 yuan from relatives and friends to open a coppersmith workshop. While looking for premises, he was invited to gamble in a gambling den in western Shanghai by bad friends. He originally intended to win some money to expand his business capital, but unfortunately, the gambling gods did not favor him. Huang gambled several times and lost all the money he had raised. In desperation and feeling ashamed, he had thoughts of ending his life.

### Food: Rice Merchants Cleverly Employ Propaganda to Secure Thousands of Tons of Foreign Rice; Insufficient Shipping Capacity Reveals its Role

Recently, there has been another large-scale propaganda campaign in the rice market, designed to mislead people and alleviate the responsibility of rice merchants and outside speculators who hoard and manipulate the market, harming the people's food supply. The intent is extremely sinister. Despite calls for people to buy rice in advance and form group purchases, there is no consideration of how to "group" or how to "purchase." If only companies and firms are considered as group units, how many companies and firms can actually undertake group rice purchases for their employees? Even if companies and firms can all do this, how can the majority of food consumers who are not in companies and firms "group" together? This kind of action only makes the public feel confused and gives rice merchants and speculators the opportunity to raise prices and manipulate the market. They may think they are taking precautions, but they are actually obstructing the people's food supply. Recently, there have also been widespread rumors of insufficient shipping capacity, but according to this newspaper's investigation, arrivals from the source have been continuous in recent days, and there are still many goods on the way. All of this is because a group of powerful speculators in Shanghai, still not satisfied with their fortunes, are willing to use all kinds of means to create pretexts for manipulating the people's food supply. Otherwise, why would it be like this? Yesterday morning, the foreign rice market rose again due to this. The reason was simply that the previous day's price increase and the scarcity of domestic rice attracted inquiries from shopkeepers, rural customers, and speculators. The market then rose by about one yuan. However, the reality is that there are large deals for foreign rice that have been agreed upon. In addition to those being loaded immediately, there are also futures contracts for November and December. It is said that the total amount is six or seven thousand tons, ordered by Jian Yuan, Shen Ji, He Yi, Jin Fa, and others. Immediately loaded No. 1 Saigon rice is priced at 76-77 yuan, No. 2 rice at 71.5-71 yuan, November at 71 yuan, and December at 70-69.9 yuan. It is also rumored that No. 1 Saigon rice for December was once ordered at a low price of 72 yuan, which shows that the claim of insufficient shipping capacity is fabricated by speculators. As a result, people became nervous, and the market quickly collapsed, falling by about two yuan before the afternoon close, resulting in a price even lower than the previous night by a small amount. Spot price of No. 2 Yinghua Si that was returned was quoted at 74 yuan, down to 73 yuan, also down by 1.5 yuan from the previous night. In the afternoon, the market was weak, and the market remained soft.

New Gengjian and Luzhong rice, due to rain, arrived in small quantities, only four or five hundred dan. However, the market happened to be during the surge of foreign rice, and people were firmly bullish, all seeking to purchase them. The sales were exceptionally fast, resulting in a temporary shortage, and they became rare commodities. The prices of various types of rice rose sharply by one or two yuan. New Geng special original bags were priced at 85 yuan, followed by 81 yuan, bulk was 79 yuan, followed by 77 yuan. Tea seeds were 79 yuan, 77.5 yuan. Wild rice was scarce and had no market. Dujian original bags were 71 yuan, and Nangang bulk rice broke 80 yuan early. Glutinous rice, due to inactivity of wine merchants, only relied on scattered demand, so prices remained unchanged.

### Flour Remains Quiet

Flour: Yesterday's spot flour market remained quiet. Factory prices remained at 17 yuan, and customer prices were 18 yuan. There was no market for returned goods, so there were few transactions on the exchange. Foreign flour sales were also slow. Although Paotai brand foreign flour was quoted at 19 yuan, there were no formal deals. The overall market, apart from Huachang selling 8,000-9,000 bags, heard that 150 bags of No. 4 Fenghong Taohua brand were purchased from this street at a price of 15.8 yuan. There were also 15,000 bags of flour shipped to Fujian today (7th).

Wheat: Yesterday's wheat market was stagnant as usual. Because production prices were high and transportation was difficult, there was a long-term shortage of arrivals. Daily arrivals from the suburbs were all purchased by Japanese factories at the original price of 21 yuan. Chinese factories, due to the difficulty of transporting into the concessions, have not been interested for a long time. The market had little activity, with no regular trading.

### Finance: Japanese Merchants Eagerly Sell US Dollars

Foreign Exchange: Yesterday's market saw no changes in HSBC's listed rates. The black market for British and American dollars remained calm. However, some people believed that selling was beneficial because Roosevelt had won more votes. In the early morning, the market was slightly tight due to the absorption by Chinese merchants, and Japanese banks sold some spot US dollars, which then hardened the market. Added to the above situation, it was like the Wusong River before closing. The closing price for British gold was 3 pounds, 9 shillings, 3.75 pence, and the US dollar was 6.09375 yuan, up 0.015625 and 0.03125 compared to the previous day's closing. Futures for this month have been opened, but the price for the next month is the same as this month.

Jewish Merchants Also Sell at Noon

In the early morning, London's major transactions were stable in the near term and fell by 0.0625 in the long term. New York silver prices had no market, London gold remained stable, and the exchange rate of the British pound against the US dollar was unchanged.

The selling price of British gold was 3 pounds, 9 shillings, 0.625 pence, and the US dollar was 6.0625 yuan, both the same as the previous day's closing. Futures were also the same. After opening, a speculator from British Bank Macagali sold spot US dollars at a price of 6.0625 yuan. Subsequently, Chinese speculators came to settle futures US dollars, with Chinese banks in Shanghai offering 6.0625 yuan for the next month, and once asking for 6.03125 yuan, but it was only a fleeting moment. HSBC's listed rates were announced and unchanged. The silver balance tax remained unchanged. Subsequently, the price became more elastic due to aggressive sales by Japanese banks, with Mitsui and Sumitomo reportedly selling US dollars at 6.09375 yuan. Around noon, Jewish speculator Qiao Zhibufu sold US dollars, so the price continued to rise. The price for this month and next month was 6.0625 yuan and 0.09375 yuan, respectively. At noon closing, British gold was 3 pounds, 9 shillings, 2.1875 pence, and the US dollar was 6.09375 yuan. The British gold and US dollar futures prices for the current and next months were 3 pounds, 9 shillings, 0.625 pence, and 6.0625 yuan, respectively, with each increasing by 0.015625 and 0.03125, respectively. There was no trading on Wednesday afternoon.

People had no reaction and generally followed the exchange market's movements. The Bank of China initially bought in, and the price increased. Later, as the exchange market reported a hard line, gold firms slightly released their positions and pushed the price back within the 500 yuan range. As a result, it fell by 20 yuan, closing at 5,490 yuan. There was no trading on Wednesday afternoon. There were only 2,000 taels traded in half a day. Gold jewelry remained unchanged.

Spot Gold Bars Slightly Lower

Later, it rose by 15 yuan, reaching a high price of 5,530 yuan, due to silver firms helping to search for gold. However, soon gold and silver firms and money exchange shops collectively exerted selling pressure, pushing the price down into the 500 yuan range. It was estimated that silver firms entered 20 taels for the securities firms, at 5,485 yuan. Later, money exchange shops and silver firms slightly absorbed, reaching 5,505 yuan again. However, the exchange market showed signs of softening, and people became somewhat tired. Silver firms at that time intended to sell, and money exchange shops and silver firms could not sustain the position, falling sharply back into the 500 yuan range. It was estimated that silver firms sold 10 taels to money exchange shops, at 5,475 yuan. At noon, silver firms entered 20 taels for gold firms again, reporting 5,490 yuan as the noon closing price. There was no trading on Wednesday afternoon, down slightly by 20 yuan from the previous day. There was only a fluctuation of 55 yuan in half a day.

### US Currency Falls

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw a slight weakening of spot gold bars. The British and American gold pounds also fell by 5 cents each. British gold notes were still rarely traded, and the market price remained stable. US dollar notes initially rose to 16.02 yuan, but soon fell to 15.8 yuan, down 1.5 cents from the previous day's close. Hong Kong notes continued to soften. Japanese gold notes trended upward, reaching a high of 1.56 yuan in the evening market.

### Securities: Domestic Debt Slightly Fluctuates

The off-exchange market for securities stabilized somewhat yesterday. Most of the floating shorts have been covered, and the actual goods are flowing out. At this time, there is no need to cover the market price. Observing yesterday's situation, the floating longs are looking for ways to exit, but they dare not sell off boldly to prevent the market price from being suppressed. There is an appearance of slowly selling off. Tong Kang's long positions are still interested. Most of Xin Fu's long positions have been sold off, and retail investors are still holding on. The trend may change slightly because each group cannot short sell (because there are no goods available). The news environment is largely favorable, with more positive news than negative news. However, there are many waves in the future, and one should not be too optimistic. There was limited trading in the morning, and more trading in the afternoon. Tong Kang consistently bought in. Others, such as Lian He, Ding Kang, Bao Chang, and Da Tong, also absorbed large amounts, especially retail investors buying in small amounts. Hong Da and Xin Fu's long positions have gradually emerged. In the afternoon, Lian He switched to selling. Xie Kang, Yong Kang, Dun Yu, Jian Li, and Mao Tai either closed their long positions or released actual goods, so the market price rose slightly and then fell. As a result, there were more declines than increases, with the amount being only one or two cents. The amount of trading was over 2 million yuan. A simplified table is listed below:

Stock Trading: Ninety shares of Chunghwa Book Company were traded at a price of 33.25 yuan.

Also, in the public exchanges, the public concentrated on the results of the US presidential election and had little interest in the market. Price fluctuations were minimal, trading volume was small, and the underlying trend was firm. Rubber shares trended stably.

London, 5th (Tuesday Dispatch): Today, the listed prices of Chinese foreign debt and Far East British merchant companies' stocks remained stable, with no changes in the market.

### Yarn and Cotton: US Presidential Re-election, Yarn Prices Looking Down

The yarn market, which rebounded the previous day, was slightly tired yesterday. Although there was no development in actual wholesale sales, Hong Kong merchants continued to demand 32-count and 42-count fine yarn, and the selling prices were firm. Therefore, some industry players held bullish views. However, general speculators, due to President Roosevelt's re-election in the US election, sold off as they expected the market to fall. Therefore, the battle between long and short positions remained intense. Today, 920 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.

Spot yarn opened in the morning. Because of the good situation in the afternoon of the previous day, the sentiment continued to advance. The opening price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 1,203 yuan, rising slightly to 1,205 yuan. Subsequently, it was heard that the exchange rate was flat, and the long positions released, falling back to 1,190 yuan. The price declined, and a new buying trend suddenly arose. Guangdong merchants were more active in business, and the market gradually rose to 1,202 yuan. However, there were rumors that the US president could be re-elected soon, the exchange rate would rise, and yarn prices would fall. The market then fell back to 1,185 yuan. However, large industry players tended to hold on, and it rebounded slightly. The closing price was 1,193 yuan. According to statistics, the amount of transactions in half a day was 5,730 bales. The market price of 20-count Bianma fell by 15 yuan. The amount of sales from various groups is listed below:

Hong Kong 630, Trade 5,100, Total 5,730

### Production Area Cotton Prices Not Willing to be Cheap

Spot cotton trading showed some development, and the sentiment was relatively stable. Although cotton from various production areas is prohibited from being exported, the selling prices are difficult to be cheap. Because food prices are high, villagers are unwilling to sell cotton at low prices.

Foreign Cotton Market Prices: The New York cotton market was closed all day yesterday due to the presidential election. The Indian market was quiet. Yesterday, the price fell by one rupee, including forecasts.

Shanghai Port Foreign Cotton Trading: Recent trading has continued to be extremely quiet. Factories remain on the sidelines. The industry, because of the current low inventory of spot goods in the market, although selling prices are sluggish, they are still unwilling to sell cheaply. However, according to the current market situation, cotton prices will not continue to fall.

### Oilseed Cake: Raw Oil Shipped to Hong Kong

Yesterday's groundnut oil market, due to the softening trend yesterday, continued to decline in the early morning. Suddenly, Hong Kong merchants came to purchase basket-packed oil, and the sentiment was agitated for a while. The market price rose slowly. In the afternoon, Qingdao also reported an increase. Hong Kong merchants continued their purchases, buying over 3,000 pieces. As a result, general speculators and hoarders were even more aggressive in adding to their futures positions. There was a lack of selling by original owners and retailers. Although trading was not rushed, the market price exceeded the previous day's price by two or three yuan. It was estimated that 3,300 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil were traded at a price of 73 yuan, rising to 75 yuan. 50 pieces were ordered for delivery in lower November at a price of 73.75 yuan. 150 barrels of Qingdao butter were priced at 101.5-102 yuan. 300 barrels were ordered for delivery in lower November at a price of 103 yuan, falling to 102.5 yuan, and then rising to 104 yuan. 600 barrels were ordered for delivery in lower December at a price of 103.5-104.75 yuan. 50 pieces of Yantai raw oil were priced at 72.5 yuan. Soybean oil was still of little interest, and the overall trend was mediocre. It was estimated that 50 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were traded, and the price is detailed in the market price column. 20 barrels of Dalian oil and 50 dan of Dachang oil were also traded. 1,500 bags of soybeans were shipped to Hong Kong.

### Sugar Market: Sugar Rises by About One Yuan

Yesterday's sugar market turned upwards. The exchange listed 71 yuan for spot first coarse white foreign warehouse, but there were no transactions. Taikoo cart white B mark West warehouse was 71.5 yuan, up one yuan. East warehouse was 70.5 yuan, up 5 cents. DY mark East warehouse was 66.8 yuan, HX mark West warehouse was 66.2 yuan. Dutch red local warehouse was 55 yuan, up one yuan. November 8th packing order was 54.2-4 yuan. Road goods arriving November 18th was 54.5 yuan. Arriving November 11th was 54.2 yuan. Guotang opened 150 bags of Surabaya Green, priced at 68 yuan.

### Silk and Tea: US Silk Market after the Election

Yesterday, the New York silk market was closed due to the election. Yokohama silk prices remained weak, with spot prices at 1,370 yuan, down 5 yuan, and forward prices at 1,377 yuan, down 5 yuan. The local silk market is awaiting changes in New York. It is generally speculated that after the US election, all financial and market matters will undergo changes. However, it is believed that the silk market will have a short-term increase.

### Green Tea Arrivals and Sales are Both Scarce

Since the blockade of the Mediterranean Sea, the local foreign tea market has plummeted. Recently, due to the Japanese control of sources in the occupied areas, arrivals have been exhausted, and the market has become increasingly desolate. Currently, only Taiwanese black tea is being mixed with Chinese tea for export. The rest is scarce. Yesterday, only Maruzen, Xingcheng, and other firms purchased over 220 boxes of local black tea, with selling prices ranging from 240 to 270 yuan. In addition, it is said that over 100 packages of Songluo Qiqiang and other teas for domestic sales were shipped to Tianjin for sale.

### Piece Goods: Floating Stocks Dumped, Cloth Prices Plummet

Factory Cloth: Yesterday's market trend was stable, and people were calm. Factory prices were high, and spot prices on the market were lower. Dyeing factories were searching for grey cloth, and trading was quite active. Small-scale inventory trading was also very frequent. Selling prices for coarse cloth, colored cloth, and flannel were stable. Part of fine cloth and fine twill fell back by 2.5 cents per bolt. Fuguigui fine cloth was 31.5 yuan, and fine twill was 30.075 yuan. The factory side had discussed 33 yuan for fine cloth and 11 yuan for fine twill, but it was called off because the factory was unwilling to open. About 500 pieces of various cloths were traded on this street. Fujian merchants purchased over 100 pieces of colored cloth and colored twill. Zhejiang Road Wenyong merchants purchased nearly 200 pieces of colored cloth, floral flannel, fine cloth, and line cloth. Guangdong and Hong Kong merchants purchased over 100 pieces of colored cloth, bleached cloth, and poplin. Merchants from Singapore and other foreign countries purchased over 4,000 bolts of colored cloth and bleached cloth. Also, 765 pieces of cotton cloth were shipped to Hong Kong today (7th).

Eastern Cloth: Yesterday's market was filled with rumors of peaceful atmosphere. Floating holders tended to dump their stocks, and selling prices were depressed. Baibuhuilong fine cloth fell back by 5 cents per bolt. The price fluctuated narrowly in the morning and afternoon, and the closing price was 34.85 yuan. Sijunzi big falls by 1.25 cents, closing at 1.0675 yuan. Medium-grade brand fine cloth still dyed and sold well, so it only fell by 2-3 cents.

### Coal: Firewood Arrives Continuously

Due to previous disruptions in the source of firewood, there was strong demand on this street, and the market goods were completely bought up. Recently, although new goods have been arriving continuously, with boats arriving daily from downstream, the absorption capacity of this street is still strong, and they are being accepted as much as possible. There is a trend of selling as soon as they arrive. However, the market price has become loose. Yesterday, Dabafan white firewood was selling for 1.25 yuan per bundle, Zhongtai firewood for 2.5 bundles, Huangtan firewood for 2.75 bundles, Longzhong for 3 bundles, and Xiaochai for 5 bundles. Wharf cart loading and unloading and street porterage were added separately.

### Metals　Steel Bar Market Desolate

Bamboo-joint steel bars, lately due to a sharp decrease in customer routes, coupled with minimal demand from local construction firms and even fewer stockpilers and small-scale buyers, the market situation is extremely bleak. The standard price has fallen repeatedly. Currently, 3/4-inch bars have dropped from $1,150 to $1,100 per ton, while 5/8-inch to 1-inch bars have fallen from $1,100 to $1,050 per ton. It is reported that the volume of transactions is only several dozen tons.

Free Talk

Free Debate

### Where Should Women Go? (1)

— Editor

In the recent discussions about women's future paths, Mr. Wu Qizhai argued that women should return to the home. He based his argument on various points, including physiology, psychology, society, the nation, career, self-reliance, and family, making it a representative work of those who advocate "women returning to the home." After receiving this manuscript, we specifically forwarded it to Ms. Jiang Yihui, who had previously published an article titled "Our Path" in this publication, asking her to express her opinions. It is impossible to publish both manuscripts simultaneously in the limited space of "Free Talk," and publishing them separately would likely lose the connection. Therefore, we plan to publish both manuscripts in installments concurrently, titled "Where Should Women Go?" as a small conclusion to the discussion of women's future paths and also as the beginning of the "Free Debate" column. We will continue to hold such debates when suitable topics are found.

Mr. Wu Qizhai believes that "When discussing this major issue, we cannot judge it based on just one or two individuals or from only one perspective. We should take women who are physiologically and psychologically normal as the subject and analyze and study them from all aspects to determine where women should ultimately go."

Ms. Jiang Yihui, on the other hand, believes that "We should have a correct understanding of the so-called 'women who are physiologically and psychologically normal.' We must know that a normal woman, like any normal man, hopes to progress and develop in her career, and she, like a man, desires to have a happy family. These desires are basic human needs. To enhance personal happiness and well-being, and to enable individuals to make the highest contribution to society, these desires should be reasonably satisfied and balanced in individual lives. It is incorrect to overemphasize women's interest in the family and neglect her interest in society. At the same time, it is unreasonable to expect all women who aspire to engage in social activities to sacrifice family happiness. Because they are normal women, their desires and abilities should have opportunities for normal development and expression. The fact that some women sacrifice their careers for the sake of their families, or have to sacrifice their families for the sake of their careers, is harmful and detrimental to both the individual woman and society."

I shouldn't say much more. The following is the beginning of their debate on "Women and Physiology":

### Women Should Return to the Home

— Qi Zhai

(1) Women and Physiology: Humanity can continue endlessly because women have a unique "reproductive instinct" in their physiology. Since the "reproductive instinct" is a unique instinct of women, it naturally has a great impact on women's lives. After a woman gets married, she must become pregnant and give birth, which no one can forbid. From the beginning of pregnancy, new changes occur in a woman's physiology, and she needs rest from time to time. After childbirth, she needs at least four weeks of rest to recover from her physiological changes. During breastfeeding, she cannot work too hard, which would affect the milk and harm the baby's health. (Regarding breastfeeding, although there are now artificial methods to feed babies, it is always better than breast milk, because breast milk can naturally adjust the nutrients in the milk as the baby grows. Therefore, modern medical scientists, unless absolutely necessary, advocate "mother breastfeeding" in order to achieve the ideal health of the baby.) A woman's ability to give birth varies. On average, she gives birth every two years, so after a woman gets married, she needs a year of intermittent rest and another year of semi-rest in two years.

### Women Should Enter Society

— Yihui

(1) Women and Physiology: From the physiological point of view, women's reproductive abilities vary. Some women are unable to give birth throughout their lives, while others give birth eight or more times in their lives. However, both of these types of women account for a very small minority of all women. The majority of women have an average of three to four births in their lifetime. During pregnancy, some women are able to work as usual without feeling tired at all. Some women are more prone to fatigue and should only engage in light work. A very small number of women need long-term rest during pregnancy and cannot work at all. This last type of woman is mostly affected by basic physical health problems and is therefore not included in our discussion.

Each time a woman gives birth, she needs a rest of eight to twelve weeks. Assuming a woman gives birth four times in her lifetime and needs twelve weeks of rest each time, she spends a total of forty-eight weeks (less than a year) on childbirth and recovery. Many people spend more time in bed due to illness than this! A year is very short in the whole of life. Can we bury a woman's entire life and sacrifice her possible contribution to society for twenty or thirty years because of this mere year? Perhaps some will say that it is not only childbirth that affects a woman's career. Breastfeeding also limits a woman's profession. However, we need to know that modern scientific methods of childcare do not require the mother to hold the baby all day long. Breastfeeding must be at a certain time, usually every four hours. Within these four hours, women have ample time to engage in any kind of useful work. It is true that overwork can affect breast milk, but if one stays at home all day without proper work, the milk can also become too thick and affect the baby's digestion. Therefore, many doctors agree that breastfeeding mothers should have adequate work and activities to regulate their lives.

Huo Sang Detective Case

### The Ballerina's Ending

— By Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter 10 The Shoe Problem

The three of us were originally standing on the sidewalk next to the car. At this time, Huo Sang first darted across the road and headed towards the Fengtai Cigarette Paper Store. Ni Jinshou and I naturally followed closely. Huo Sang went to the entrance of the cigarette paper store, took out a ten-yuan legal tender note, and bought a pack of Bai Jin Long cigarettes. His eyes carefully glanced around the store. I saw that there were a total of three people inside, two middle-aged clerks and one apprentice who was fifteen or sixteen years old. From the outside, there was absolutely nothing suspicious to be seen. The one who served Huo Sang and sold him the cigarettes was the apprentice who was fifteen or sixteen years old. Huo Sang, while examining the legal tender notes he received in change one by one, casually chatted, "Is your boss Lao Yan inside?"

The apprentice raised his eyes to look at Huo Sang's face, shook his head, and said, "He's gone out. Do you know him?"

At this moment, something unexpected happened. Ni Jinshou suddenly raised his left hand and shouted loudly, "Hey, Lao Han, what are you doing here?"

It turned out that at that time, someone had just poked his head out from behind the store to take a look, and was seen by Ni Jinshou. This person originally didn't want to come out, but was called out by Ni Jinshou, and couldn't avoid coming out to say a few words.

That person called Lao Han said, "Detective Ni, long time no see, how's the busy-ness going? Where are you headed?" Actually, that person wasn't old, wearing a light gray serge single robe, similar in stature and age to me, also very alert and intelligent in demeanor.

Ni Jinshou replied, "Just strolling around." He lowered his voice a little. "Lao Han, do you have someone here called Zhao Boxiong?"

That Lao Han asked, slightly surprised, "Zhao Boxiong? Yes, he was just here. Detective Ni, do you know him?"

Ni Jinshou replied, "Yes, is he still here at the moment?"

"He's already gone to Nanjing, he left less than ten minutes ago. What do you need him for?"

Ni Jinshou hesitated slightly, just about to say the words "he is," but Huo Sang quickly answered, "It's nothing. We just wanted to chat with him casually. Let's go, Detective Ni." He casually put the legal tender notes and cigarettes into his pocket and turned to leave.

### Road Worker

— Liu Jiagan

I am willing to be a road worker.

High mountains and steep peaks cannot stop my path, small streams and trickles cannot evoke my sorrow; silently, perseveringly, paving the way forward... It's raining, and I give a hearty laugh to the sky, I thank the sky for giving me a natural "bath"; the thorns all over the ground don't attract my attention, even though my hands and legs are sometimes pricked, I just wipe away the flowing blood, "Never mind!" The wind is blowing hard, whistling, but I sing as if welcoming it, I hope the wind will send my singing to distant and remote places, where many friends are missing me, let them know that I am still so happy in the struggle, and there is absolutely no frustration.

The road stretches endlessly forward. Our predecessors opened half of it, then left; leaving shovels, mirrors, axes... for us, this younger generation! We extend our trembling hands, carefully accept this precious "gift", we are determined—or rather, it can be said to be our oath—to open a road to "brightness," where there is true human happiness....

Go forward, noble road workers! Your sweat and blood will not be shed in vain, and the rewards you receive will be praised!

I—am willing to be a road worker.

### Isolated Island Drama

— Wei Wei

The play "Five Men of Justice" has not been performed often in recent years. The protagonist of this play, Zhou Wenyuan, was originally a martial arts actor who could sing and tumble, and Yang Xiaolou and Wang Changlin both performed this play in their early years, both excelling. This play is not very popular with non-professionals, and it is very difficult to please the audience. Therefore, very few people have performed it in recent times. The role of Zhou Wenyuan must be able to recite, and the recitation must be loud and clear. He must be able to fight, and the fighting must be clean. The acting and expressions are also very important. The supporting roles must also be well-organized. The painted face Yan Peiwei and the clown Di Hulu are both extremely important. In the past, when Xiaolou performed this, he used Qian Jinfu to play Yan Peiwei and Chuan Xiaoshan to play Di Hulu. The red flowers and green leaves complemented each other, and it was truly a masterpiece. Since Xiaolou's death, there have been very few martial arts actors who are good at performing this play. There are only Ru Fulan, Li Shengbin, and Ye Shengzhang from Fu Liancheng. Among these three, Shengzhang is slightly better than Fulan and Shengbin because he originally specialized in singing and tumbling, and his recitation and acrobatics are excellent.

Not long ago, the faculty and staff of the Shanghai Drama School performed this play. Rui Debao played this play, with Liang Liangui as Yan Peiwei and Shi Xiaoshan as Di Hulu, but the performance failed to satisfy the audience. Firstly, Lao Rui was old, his martial arts skills had deteriorated, and his voice was not good, and his recitation was not very pleasant, so it was difficult to achieve good results. Recently, I watched Ru Fulan perform this play in Huangjin, with Yuan Shihai playing Yan Peiwei and Sun Shengwu playing Di Hulu, and Zhang Lianting as the senior captain and Gao Shenghong as the second captain. All of them were disciples of Fu Liancheng, and their martial arts skills were pure and skilled. The performance was very lively and wonderful, and its highlights were unmatched by Rui Debao and Liang Lianjia.

Looking at the performance of Ru Fulan and others on that day, Yuan Shihai's Yan Peiwei was the most outstanding. His acting and expressions were excellent. In the fighting scene, there was a "flying kick" and a "canopy", which were clean and neat, showing great skill. I think Hou Xirui in his prime was only like this. However, the tunes sung by Shihai did not seem to be very skilled, perhaps because he had not performed this play for a long time, which was a minor flaw. Fulan's Zhou Wenyuan worked very hard, and Sun Shengwu's Di Hulu was also good, still performing "robbing the back" and "hanging hair," which could not be achieved without formal training. Zhang Lianting and Gao Shenghong's captains were also competent. The "Five Men of Justice" seen that day can be said to be rare in Jiangnan in recent years, so I have recorded it as above.

### "Women" on Stage

— Jie

We know that there is a movie called "Women," starring more than a dozen female stars such as Norma Shearer and Joan Crawford. It is a new work that has no men but talks entirely about men's affairs. At that time, many viewers were thinking: If such a script with all women appearing could be staged on the stage, it would definitely be a sensation. Because this would not only create a new style for stage plays, but also unfold a very moving story in terms of content.

The China Travel Troupe is one of the professional drama troupes in Shanghai. Their female members seem to be more than those of other professional drama troupes. And they are always discovering new talents. For example, Sun Jinglu, who became famous in one fell swoop with "The Qin Huai Family," was originally a basic member of the China Travel Troupe. This time, Tang Huaiqiu suddenly had a whim and secretly rehearsed a "Women's Stage Play" with all female troupe members participating. This "Women's Stage Play" has been rehearsed skillfully and will meet the audience at the Xuan Palace starting tomorrow night (the 8th).

We don't hope that its story, like the movie, will not have much meaning. On the contrary, we can inspire a new era of consciousness and the outlook on life of new women from the mouths of women on the stage. This is a point that makes us pay attention.

Children's Historical Drama

### "Xia Cungu" Completed

Wei Ruhui has recently completed the children's historical drama "Xia Cungu." Xia was a young hero of the late Ming Dynasty, from Songjiang. At the age of fifteen, he witnessed the daily decline of the country's affairs, and followed his teacher to raise the banner of righteousness in the Taihu Lake area. For a time, there were many responses. At the age of eighteen, he was captured by the Qing soldiers and killed in Nanjing. Half of the characters appearing in this play are children. It is said that it will be led by Qian Yi. Qian once played Xiao Li in "Regret of the Late Ming Dynasty" and Zheng Chenggong's son in "Sea Hero." He is a young actor who is well-known in the drama world today. If this play can be performed, it is said that it will be performed in the name of the "Midnight Drama Club." (Hai Xing)

### Where is Bai Hong Going?

— Xing

Bai Hong, an important supporting actor in the United National Troupe, recently informed the company's drama department that she should no longer be assigned roles in new plays, because she will be traveling far away to seek other developments. According to insiders, it is speculated that Bai Hong's departure is not to Yunnan, Chongqing and other places, and the destination is still unknown. According to Bai Hong, although she is not a top celebrity among the actors of the United National Troupe, she is highly valued for her superb acting skills. If she resigns, the United National Troupe will lose a good talent. It is a pity, and the "new road" where Bai Hong is going is very promising, and it is also worth considering for herself.
