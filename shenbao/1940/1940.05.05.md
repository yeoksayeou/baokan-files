Editorial

### Turkey, the Cornerstone of Near East Peace

This week, the Executive Yuan of the National Government decided to appoint Zhang Pengchun as the Chinese Ambassador to Turkey. Since He Yaozu returned to China, the post of Chinese envoy to Turkey has been vacant for several years. This appointment is indeed timely. As Zhang said to reporters in Chongqing, "Turkey is not only a major power in the eastern Mediterranean, but also one of the most important keys to the international situation." With Zhang's erudition and talent, he will be able to perform his duties well. The Chinese government's continued diplomatic activities while actively resisting the war are also commendable. Recently, the overall situation in Europe has become increasingly tense. After a small lull in the fighting in Norway, the development of the war has tended to shift from Northern Europe to Southeastern Europe, which has further increased Turkey's importance.

Turkey was originally a large empire in the Near East. Since the 18th century, internal political and religious corruption and external encroachment by the great powers led to a decline in the country's strength. During the First World War, Turkey assisted Germany and Austria against Britain and France. After its defeat, it was forced to sign the Treaty of Sèvres, which almost lost all its territory outside Asia Minor. However, the Turkish people, under the leadership of the late President Kemal, were finally able to defeat Greece in battle and sign the Treaty of Lausanne. Except for Palestine, Syria, Mesopotamia, Arabia, and Egypt, it restored other old territories and abolished all unequal treaties. At the same time, it worked hard to reform its internal affairs and develop its economy. The country's strength has been increasing day by day, and it has become the most powerful leading country on the eastern shore of the Mediterranean.

The revival of Turkey was not only due to its arduous military struggle, but also to its skillful use of diplomacy. For the past 20 years, Turkey has consistently maintained peace as its core principle in its international relations. Therefore, in 1925, it signed a treaty of neutrality and mutual guarantee with the Soviet Union. In 1928, it signed a treaty of friendship and arbitration with Italy. In 1934, it signed the Balkan Pact with Greece, Yugoslavia, and Romania to maintain the status quo in Southeastern Europe. In 1937, it signed the Middle East Pact with Iraq, Iran, and Afghanistan to protect the security of West Asia. As a result of the Montreux Convention in 1936, Turkey was able to recover the rights of armament and control of the Dardanelles and Bosporus straits, which further increased its responsibility for maintaining peace in Eastern Europe and its importance in the international arena.

Therefore, after Germany and Italy successively annexed Czechoslovakia and Albania by force last spring, Britain and France, in view of the deterioration of the European situation, not only provided security guarantees to Romania and Greece, but also conducted negotiations with Turkey. As a result, the British-Turkish negotiations matured in May, the French-Turkish negotiations matured in June, and the British-French-Turkish mutual assistance pact was finally signed in the Turkish capital on October 19. At that time, the European war had already broken out for more than a month, and Turkey still resolutely joined hands with Britain and France, preparing to jointly resist aggression. At the same time, Turkey has been able to maintain its friendship with the Soviet Union; even with Germany and Italy, it has never categorically refused to speak to them, but publicly stated that the status quo of the Balkan countries must be respected. From all this, we can see Turkey's courageous attitude, pure stand, and flexible diplomacy, all of which have superior performances. The fact that the southeastern corner of Europe, with its many small and weak countries, has not yet fallen into the hands of the god of war is due to many factors, but Turkey has played a key supporting role. Because what Germany and Italy are most concerned about in the Balkans and the Near East is Turkey, and what Britain and France rely on most to fulfill their security guarantees to Greece and Romania is also Turkey, especially the British and French navies, which must pass through the two Turkish straits to reach the Romanian ports. At the end of March this year, senior representatives from Britain, France, and Turkey held a military conference in Aleppo, Syria, and reached a complete compromise on measures to be taken by the three countries in the event of a war expanding to the Near East. This shows Turkey's firm belief in maintaining peace in the Near East, which can be called the cornerstone of Near East peace, and is by no means an overstatement.

The European war is currently brewing new changes. The German army has made considerable progress in Norway, but this is not enough to eliminate Germany's difficulties or meet Germany's needs. If Germany wants to invade Sweden, it cannot but take the Soviet Union into account. The economic negotiations between the Soviet Union and Sweden have just begun, which, from a certain perspective, can be seen as a diplomatic posture of the Soviet Union warning Germany. Because Germany's economic difficulties must be resolved; the resources of the Balkans have long been coveted by Germany, so it is very likely that Germany's direction of development will shift to Southeastern Europe in the near future. The German ambassador to Turkey, Papen, was recently summoned back to Germany; the British and French joint fleet has also arrived in Egypt; Italy's attitude has not diminished its ambiguity. All these subtle dynamics symbolize the increasing tension in the Near East, and Turkey's measures are of great importance. It is expected to become the center of attention for the whole world in an instant.

China and Turkey have a long history of relations, with close blood ties and good diplomatic relations. In this dramatic global situation, China is the vanguard of resistance to aggression in the Far East, while Turkey is the cornerstone of peace in the Near East. I therefore take Zhang Pengchun's appointment to Turkey as an opportunity to discuss the relationship between Turkey and the overall European situation as above. With today's advanced science and convenient transportation, peace has become indivisible and the world has become one. Although China and Turkey are separated by the East and the West, their goals of struggle are the same and their aspirations are united. If they can join hands to work together, they will surely be able to bring about the arrival of success earlier, and those who benefit will be not only China and Turkey.

### Six Supply Depots on the Yunnan-Burma Road Destroyed by Fire

Rangoon: A Ministry of National Defense communiqué today mentioned the fire that destroyed six supply depots at the Chinese armory in the Chih-fang (transliterated) area of the Yunnan-Burma Road, saying that there was suspicion of sabotage by traitors. Chinese officials denied that it was caused by a Japanese air raid. Two Chinese soldiers and 25 laborers were killed. 12 laborers are still missing and 6 were seriously injured. 20 British nationals were injured, 18 of whom have been sent to the Lashio Hospital, but none have died. After the armory disaster, there are two large holes on the ground that are 60 feet wide and 30 feet deep. The town of Chih-fang was not badly damaged, nor was the hospital. The ceiling of the tropical disease research laboratory run by Americans collapsed, destroying several microscopes. (Reuters dispatch on the 4th)

### Chongqing Mayor Broadcasts to the United States

Chongqing: The mayor of Chongqing made a broadcast to the United States this morning, claiming that Chongqing is fully prepared for future Japanese air raids, and that the citizens of Chongqing do not need to be assembled in one place during air raids as they were a year ago. The result of the Japanese air raids in various parts of Free China is only to make the Chinese people have an unshakable belief and will to resist the war, and will never cause the Chinese people to be afraid. The Japanese bombing of Chongqing has two purposes: one is to create chaos and unrest in Chongqing, and the other is to make the Chinese people afraid so that they can surrender to them. But the Japanese have failed in both of these attempts. The chaos and unrest that occurred after the first air raid on Chongqing lasted only one night. The Japanese have actually taught the Chinese people how to defend themselves. Countless caves and air-raid shelters have been built, and people's houses have also been built outside the city. The people of the whole country are now united as one to resist the inhuman and barbaric forces. (United Press)

### Central Government's Appointment of Four Chairmen is of Great Significance

Chongqing: The Chinese government's announcement of the appointment of the chairmen of the four northeastern provinces has aroused great interest among people here. The new chairmen are: Wan Fulin of Liaoning Province, Zou Zuohua of Jilin Province, Ma Zhanshan of Heilongjiang Province, and Miao Zhenliu of Rehe Province. There is no official explanation regarding this matter, but it is generally believed that the Chinese government's appointment of the chairmen of the four northeastern provinces at this time is intended to clearly show its policy of not recognizing "Manchukuo" and still regarding the four northeastern provinces as a part of China. This move is of great significance, because there have been rumors that China may agree to recognize "Manchukuo" as one of the final peace conditions. It is said that the people of the four northeastern provinces have applied to have the affairs of the four northeastern provinces handled by people from the province in the future. The Chinese government's move is an official recognition of the above application, because the new chairmen of the four provinces are all former subordinates of Zhang Xueliang. (Reuters dispatch on the 4th)

Talk by the Secretary-General of the National Defense Committee

Yesterday's newspaper in Chongqing reported that the National Government ordered the appointment of Wan Fulin and others as chairmen of the Liaoning and other provincial governments. The reporter therefore visited Secretary-General Zhang of the Supreme National Defense Committee and received the following statement. Since the September 18th Incident, the four provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe have been forcibly occupied by the Japanese. The Chinese government is deeply concerned about the compatriots in these provinces who are groaning in misery, and is constantly planning to recover them. The compatriots throughout the country hold the righteous indignation of common hatred, and the anti-Japanese sentiment is getting stronger and stronger. Since the July 7th Incident, the Chinese side has been united and united in sincerity, and the long-term and comprehensive war of resistance has lasted for three years. The Chinese army has been fighting one after another, getting stronger and stronger. The Japanese army has fallen into a situation where it cannot advance or retreat. The Chinese side's confidence in winning the war of resistance has been strengthened by this. It is actively planning to recover all lost land in order to maintain the integrity of the territory. In order to meet the needs of the facts, the military and political affairs of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe provinces should be the responsibility of senior officials. Comrades Wan Fulin, Zou Zuohua, Ma Zhanshan, and Miao Zhenliu have long been famous and have made great efforts to plan the major affairs of each province. Therefore, the government ordered them to preside over the provincial administration separately. Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang provinces are habitually referred to as the three eastern provinces due to geographical and historical reasons. In order to actively plan the party and government affairs and military affairs of the three provinces, the Military Affairs Commission will set up a war zone party and government committee, Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang branch, to concentrate the strength of the three provinces and carry out recovery. The party and government affairs and military affairs of Rehe will be planned by a certain war zone branch in the vicinity. (Dispatch on the 4th)

### Central Government Allocates Funds to Run the Northwest Agriculture Loan

Chongqing: The Chinese government has now decided to allocate 20 million yuan for agricultural loans in Northwest China, with Gansu as the center, in order to create a natural granary adapted to wartime needs. According to official sources, the government has designed six state-run farms in Gansu. In addition to poppies, rice grains have also been planted. The future harvest is expected to ensure the food security of the 3 million people in Gansu. At the same time, this loan may help develop the inland industry of Gansu, because in the past year, the province produced only 5% of the industrial products consumed in Gansu.

### The So-Called Opening of the Pearl River is Nominal

Guangzhou: The Pearl River is now open to the outside world under various restrictions. The customs here has resumed its work. Baggage inspection, which was carried out by the police, is now done by customs officials themselves. The small boats and other items originally belonging to the customs have now been returned by the Japanese. It has been two weeks since the Pearl River was announced to be open, but the British ships that arrive in Guangzhou once a week have not carried any cargo to and from. It is reported that the Taikoo Dockyard is not accepting cargo because the authorities here require the dock workers employed by the firm to be those designated by them. It is also reported that the Hong Kong authorities have not yet had British ships carry cargo to Guangzhou. The reasons are unknown, but it is heard that this is related to the status of the Guangdong Customs in Hong Kong. It is rumored that the Guangdong Customs has set up an office in Hong Kong to handle applications for transporting goods into Guangdong, so that these applications are no longer handled by the Maritime Customs Commissioner in Hong Kong, and that these applications must first be appraised by the Customs Superintendent before they can be approved by the Commissioner. This is the biggest obstacle to the restoration of foreign trade. This approach has caused inconvenience, and the Customs Superintendent, who has a political position, will also abuse his power. In general, there are many restrictions, and Huangpu is still blocked, so the opening of the Pearl River to third countries is just an empty gesture. Although some people believe that this is the first step in gradually restoring normal commercial procedures, many conveniences, such as the unrestricted sailing of foreign ships, the non-interference of the powers of the Customs and the Commissioner, and the improvement of berthing methods, must be restored one by one before the first stage of commercial revival can be achieved.

### Key Points of the Small Industrial and Commercial Loan Program

Chongqing: The Ministry of Economic Affairs has special measures for small industrial and commercial loans in various provinces.

There are 20 articles in this case. Once it is submitted to the Yuan for approval, it can be announced and implemented. The main points of the draft are that small industrial and commercial enterprises that produce daily necessities and are certified by the industry association can apply for loans from local financial institutions. Small commercial loans can reach 5,000 yuan, and small industrial loans can reach 20,000 yuan. The maximum interest rate is no more than 9% per month. (Dispatch on the 4th)

### U.S. Treasury Secretary Declares Continued Gold Purchases, Gold Reserves Reach $18.6 Billion, To Be Used After the War to Heal the Wounds

Washington: Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, in a speech at the Democratic Women's Association, stated that the current European war would inflict significant economic damage on countries around the world. The United States currently has $18.6 billion in gold reserves, which will be used after the war to heal the wounds. The Treasury Department is currently purchasing large amounts of gold, which is the right thing to do. Once the madness and destructive force of the war comes to an end, the United States will be able to leverage its gold reserves and fulfill its mission in the reconstruction effort. A portion of the gold reserves will automatically flow back to foreign countries because once peace is restored, the confidence of capitalists in various countries will also be restored, thereby withdrawing their funds deposited in the United States. Another portion can be used to develop American import trade without hindering domestic business activities. The remaining portion can be invested in foreign countries when American capitalists have security guarantees. "In short, we must dedicate ourselves to a dual responsibility: to promote the recovery of all industries and to assist foreign countries in restoring peace and security, as prosperity, peace and security are the supreme goals of American policy." Morgenthau then strongly defended the current monetary policy, stating that among the currencies of all countries in the world, the American currency is the soundest, and in recent years, it has gradually become an international currency. "We must continue to accept the gold flowing into the United States from foreign countries. This is the only sound policy. If gold stops flowing in, international exchange rates and American business will be completely disrupted, and domestic unemployment will inevitably increase significantly. After foreign countries establish lasting peace and a stable economy, the gold problem can be automatically resolved." (Havas, 3rd)

New York: U.S. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau declared last night at a political rally that, personally, he would rather have gold than foreign paper money. The U.S. dollar has a huge gold reserve, so it is the most stable currency in the world. Germany and other countries are planning to use barter methods to conduct trade to replace the free exchange of gold regulation. In fact, barter is a worse method. The reason why Germany and other countries adopt this method is not because they distrust gold, but simply because they lack gold. He believes that if one or two dictators were to rule most of the world, the future value of gold would be threatened, but he is definitely not worried that this will ever happen. (Reuters, 4th)

### Arita and Grew Continue Talks with Sayre

Tokyo: The "completely informal" talks between Japanese Foreign Minister Arita and U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines Sayre continued today. When Sayre called on the Foreign Minister, U.S. Ambassador to Japan Grew also accompanied him. The Japanese Foreign Ministry also issued a statement today, claiming that the talks between Foreign Minister Arita and Sayre and Grew have proven that some issues in U.S.-Japan relations may have hope of clarification. The Foreign Ministry also said that Foreign Minister Arita may host a banquet for Sayre on Monday. Meanwhile, the Asahi Shimbun commented on Grew's announcement of postponing his trip to the United States, saying that the change in the U.S. Ambassador's plan was due to the lack of improvement in U.S.-Japan relations. Because the current situation in the Far East does not allow Ambassador Grew to leave his post. The newspaper also pointed out that the postponement of British Ambassador to Japan Craigie's trip to the United States was also due to the new developments in the Far East. (Associated Press, 4th)

### U.S. Government Studies Warship Designs, U.S. Navy Secretary Suggests to Japan Exchange of Warship Construction Information

Tokyo: Regarding the suggestion made by U.S. Navy Secretary Edison that the U.S. and Japan exchange warship construction information, naval observers here call it "a clever tactic by the U.S. Navy to obtain Japanese warship construction information" and "an attempt to shift the blame for naval competition onto Japan." According to a report from New York, Edison announced on May 1st that the Navy Department had information confirming that Japan was building eight to twelve super-battleships. If the Japanese Navy publicly denied it, he would be willing to revise this information. Edison also said, "If the Japanese spokesperson provides us with warship construction information, I would be very happy to hear it and would definitely accept the Japanese proposal for the exchange of information." (Reuters, 4th)

Washington: President Roosevelt told reporters yesterday that the U.S. government is now studying various possible improvements in the structure of U.S. warships. The President said this in response to questions about the Navy Secretary Edison's statement that warships would be redesigned to have greater protection against bombing attacks. According to Edison, who returned a few days ago from inspecting naval exercises in the Pacific, aircraft currently have a temporary advantage over warships, but this advantage can be eliminated by improving the warship's structural design. In the past, sufficient attention was not paid to the protection of sailors and weaponry on deck. In the future, we will find ways to remove various gears that can be shattered by bombs or artillery shells. (Reuters, 4th)

### Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare Conducts Health Checkups

Tokyo: In order to improve the health of the people, the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare, together with public and private organizations across the country, started conducting health checkups yesterday. It is estimated that 40,000 doctors will examine the physical condition of 5 million people, with particular attention paid to the examination of tuberculosis patients. Participants in this effort include 140 hospitals affiliated with the Japan Industrial Association, 120 hospitals affiliated with the Imperial Relief Fund Committee, 68 hospitals of the Japanese Red Cross, and over 100 local health departments and tuberculosis sanatoriums. In addition, the authorities of the Ministry of Health and Welfare plan to add a sports bureau within the ministry to be responsible for guiding physical education, gymnastics, gliding, and student manual labor matters.

### Dutch Government Strives to Develop Relations with the United States, Hopes for Security Guarantees for the Dutch East Indies

The Hague: Foreign observers here recently said that the U.S. and Japanese governments recently issued declarations stating their positions on the issue of the Dutch East Indies, which the Dutch people welcomed, because maintaining the status quo in the Pacific is in the common interest of both the U.S. and Japan. Although the general public inevitably feels uneasy about the future of the East Indies, the Dutch government is currently working to develop relations with the United States in all aspects, even studying how to open a direct U.S.-Dutch airline route after the war. A Dutch association has recently been established in New York, and Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands and the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies have successively given broadcast speeches to the American people to enhance friendly relations between the two countries. As mentioned earlier, Dutch authorities are currently hoping that American public opinion will become increasingly concerned about the fate of the Netherlands and its territories in the Indian Ocean and the Western Hemisphere. As far as the Netherlands itself is concerned, people here believe that America's aversion to all acts of aggression is one of the guarantees of Dutch security. Although they do not believe that Germany's aggressive intentions can be dispelled by this, they still hope that the Nazi Party authorities will hesitate due to concerns about American intervention, so as to take advantage of this breathing opportunity to make preparations in military and diplomatic terms as much as possible. As far as the Dutch East Indies are concerned, the general public has more specific hopes for the United States, because they know that these islands have always supplied the United States with various essential raw materials, especially tin and rubber, so the United States cannot ignore them. In any case, in view of the precarious international situation, the Dutch government has decided to build three battlecruisers for the territory, each with a displacement of 27,000 tons. However, these warships will not be completed until 1945 or 1946. Before their completion, the confrontation between the U.S. and Japan must be used to maintain the security of these islands. What is worrying is that Japan may disregard everything and launch a surprise attack because it urgently needs various raw materials. In short, Dutch authorities are currently closely watching the tense situation between the U.S. and Japan, especially the movements of the U.S. fleet in the Pacific, because every move of these countries is enough to have a significant impact on the Dutch East Indies.

### U.S. President Continues Peace Efforts, Prevents the European War from Expanding, Inquires about the Attitudes of Various Neutral Countries to Clarify the Tense Situation in the Mediterranean

New York: A dispatch from Washington to the "New York Daily News" predicts that President Roosevelt will make new peace efforts, intending to find ways to prevent the war from spreading to Italy and the Mediterranean.

The reporter also said that President Roosevelt plans to make peace efforts before Germany moves to attack a new front. It is said that the President's plan is to probe various neutral countries, including Italy and the Vatican, so as to determine whether there is an opportunity to negotiate peace before the entire continent is caught in the vortex of war. (Reuters, 4th)

Washington: President Roosevelt told a regular press conference yesterday that the United States is now eagerly seeking activities to prevent the European war from extending to Italy and the Mediterranean. He said that the United States has always been trying to contain the expansion of the European war, but he has not mentioned whether his current efforts for peace are related to his personal intervention in the previous crises before the outbreak of the European war. A senior official of the State Department said, "The situation in the Mediterranean seems extremely bad." Undersecretary of State Welles refused to answer reporters' questions, but he admitted that the French ambassador and the ministers of Yugoslavia, Greece, and other Balkan countries visited the State Department yesterday to inquire about the situation in Italy. (Associated Press, 4th)

Washington: Greek Ambassador to the United States Diamantopoulos discussed with Undersecretary of State Welles today the incident of Italian warships concentrating near the Dodecanese Islands in the Aegean Sea and the general situation in the Mediterranean. (Reuters, 3rd)

Paris: Italy's attitude towards the current European war was somewhat chaotic due to the German propaganda machine's misleading coverage. But since the U.S. government inquired about Italy's true intentions through diplomatic channels, the situation has been clarified, and rumors that Italy was about to take action in the Balkans have been dispelled. Political figures here are therefore satisfied and said that if Italy does fight alongside Germany, the United States will inevitably implement the current Neutrality Act in the Mediterranean, which would be equivalent to a complete economic blockade of Italy. If Italy wants to obtain raw materials, it will inevitably seek them from the Soviet Union. In other words, the country will be forced to form a triangular alliance with Germany and the Soviet Union, which has always been a path the country has feared. (Havas, 3rd)

English and French Control of the Mediterranean Entrances Provokes Intense Resentment in Italian Public Opinion

Rome: The reinforcement of naval power by the British and French navies in the Mediterranean has been commented on by fascist newspapers, which said that this was directed against Italy, but no matter what kind of threat, Italy can deal with it. Renowned journalist Gayda published an article in the semi-official Italian Daily, stating, "The British and French navies are concentrated in the Mediterranean based on a common political plan, which is aimed at our country and is already commonplace in our country, so the attitude is extremely calm, and they are continuing to freely promote their policies, with the goal of protecting their legitimate interests and maintaining what they consider to be the highest interests of Europe. However, if the purpose of this abnormal and mysterious display of military power by the British and French navies is to launch an offensive attempt to divert attention and revitalize the prestige of England and France politically and militarily, Italy will inevitably cause a swift and tough reaction." (Havas, 4th)

Rome: Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, in his recent conversation with U.S. Ambassador to Italy Phillips, reportedly told the U.S. ambassador that he considered the closure of the Suez Canal and the prohibition of Italian navigation to be an unfriendly and provocative act. Simultaneously with the Italian Prime Minister's remarks, the Italian press launched anti-British rhetoric. General Balbo, Governor of Libya, was the first to publish anti-British comments in the Banano newspaper, saying that Italy's patience has reached its limit and Italy will sooner or later be forced to control the entrances to the Mediterranean. (Associated Press, 4th)

### German Attention Shifts to Southeastern Europe, Small Countries Feel Uneasy

Bern: Swiss newspapers recently published dispatches from Berlin saying that German public opinion believes that the Norwegian war has receded in importance, so they are paying attention to the situation in the Mediterranean and Italy's attitude, and asking what tactics the British and French will adopt. The German press and political circles are still attacking Britain, accusing it of deliberately expanding the scope of the war, but they are uneasy about where the Allied forces will be used after withdrawing from central Norway. The newspapers also said that the situation in the Mediterranean will be closely watched by Germany. (Havas, 4th)

The Hague: Newspapers here recently published a dispatch from Berlin saying that German political figures are now eager to know "now that the Norwegian front has become a German front, where will the British troops attack again?" In other words, Norway has become a German protectorate, and it is unknown which country Germany will place under its protection. Currently, the Nazi Party is accusing Britain of intending to expand the scope of the war and said that Germany will never be taken advantage of by Britain and will preemptively strike, just like it did in Norway. Neutral observers in Berlin are quite uneasy about this attitude and fear that Germany may take action in Southeastern Europe, but the Netherlands and Belgium may not be able to rest easy. The Essen National Daily (the organ of Aviation Minister General Goering) reported that Britain and the Soviet Union are again confronting each other in the East, because Turkey is clearly leaning towards Britain and France, which has caused the Montreux Convention (the convention on the re-fortification of the Dardanelles Strait) to lose its basis in spirit. The Soviet Union cannot tolerate this for long and wants to seize the port of Istanbul in Turkey and place the Dardanelles Strait under its absolute control. Although France has stationed a large army in the Near East and appointed veteran General Weygand as its commander, the Soviet Union has already made preparations. (Havas, 4th)

### British and French War Preparations Completed in the Near East, Warships Congregate in Alexandria, "Desert Watch Post" Established on the Egyptian Border

Alexandria: Alexandria, which is now more important than Malta, is in a state of "absolute readiness." After a squadron of Allied warships arrived yesterday, the coastal artillery and anti-aircraft artillery are now defended by soldiers. Military aircraft have temporarily suspended flights so that aircraft and personnel can be immediately summoned, and military police leave have also been suspended. Other precautions include "Desert Watch Posts," that is, from the western edge of Egypt, across the Sahara to the Nile Delta, two Egyptian sentries are stationed at intervals, with telephone lines connected. Alexandria is the main port of Egypt, located on a narrow strip of land separating the Mediterranean Sea and Lake Mariout. (Reuters, 4th)

Alexandria: A Reuters special correspondent took an Air Force patrol plane to meet the Allied fleet. It is said that the Allied fleet that entered Alexandria yesterday was the strongest fleet to sail through the Mediterranean, proving that Britain is not only able to protect its rights in the Mediterranean but also has the determination to protect them when necessary. Among the fleet that arrived here, there are several battleships, escorted by cruisers, destroyers, and submarines. They are lined up in a long line from the port of Alexandria, stretching as far as the eye can see. This is only the vanguard fleet, and a larger naval force will follow. This is bound to have a calming and profound impact in the central and eastern Mediterranean. (Reuters, 4th)

### Italy Provides Guarantees to Yugoslavia

Continue to Implement Cooperative Policies Based on the Treaty of Friendship Between the Two Countries

Rome: The Italian government has solemnly provided guarantees to the Yugoslav authorities, stating that Italy will continue to implement a policy of cooperation based on the agreement signed by the two countries in March 1937. However, the recent distribution of anti-Italian leaflets in Ljubljana, Yugoslavia has left a bad impression on Italy, and the Yugoslav authorities should pay attention to this. For the sake of friendly relations between the two countries, it is necessary to take the necessary measures to prevent similar incidents from happening again. Regarding this matter, according to observers, U.S. Ambassador to Italy Phillips recently inquired with the Italian authorities about the country's intentions regarding the current European war. The Italian authorities immediately expressed their views on this. Afterwards, there were still rumors that Italy would take interventionist action against Yugoslavia. Italy then reiterated the above-mentioned guarantees to the Yugoslav government. Insiders said that from a military and political point of view, it would be useless for Italy to interfere in Yugoslavia, because since the country occupied Albania, all the important ports along the Adriatic coast have actually been under Italian control, and it is unnecessary to do more. However, the recent policy trends of Yugoslavia have indeed caused Italy to feel doubts. For example, former Yugoslav Prime Minister Stojadinović, who was regarded as a strong supporter of the Rome-Berlin Axis, was recently arrested by the Yugoslav authorities, which made the Italian side feel uncomfortable. Secondly, Yugoslavia's economic negotiations with the Soviet Union also made Italy uneasy, deeply concerned about the Soviet Union's expansion of power in the Balkans. In short, Italy deeply hopes that Yugoslavia can avoid taking any actions that could harm their relationship. (Havas, 3rd)

Belgrade: Although the Italian side has expressed that they have no other intentions regarding rumors that Italy will abandon its non-belligerent status in the current European war, the Yugoslav authorities are currently continuing to strengthen their defenses, reportedly to cope with all unexpected events. (Havas, 4th)

### Simon's Speech on the Norwegian War Situation: Acknowledging Germany's Strength Cannot Be Underestimated; Britain Seeks Victory Regardless of Sacrifice; Labour Party Announces New Post-War Political Program

London: At a Liberal Party gathering last night, Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon spoke, expressing the Liberal Party's determination to support the war effort through hardship and toil until the threat to human freedom is eliminated. Simon described the course of the war, saying it has taught three lessons: first, the enemy's capabilities cannot be ignored. Britain has never made the mistake of underestimating the enemy's capabilities. Eight months after the start of the war, and before the decisive battle has even begun, we understand that we must face a strong enemy, organized and prepared to fight to the end, and overthrow them. Second, the unprecedented unity and determination of the British people and overseas dominions to face a strong enemy. The British nation loves peace, and unless there is a thorough judgment and awareness of the need to wage war at any cost, no power in the world could drive the British people into the flames of a great war. The full crisis of the war may not be understood for some time, but Germany's actions have placed Canada, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand at the side of the mother country, jointly waging a difficult war arising from a tyrant's determination to destroy world peace. France's response is the same as Britain's, also producing the same unity. Third, this war is a war to defend the common freedom of mankind. This is most evident. We believe in freedom, abhor war, and are unwilling to waste national resources when human destiny and normal peaceful conditions urgently need improvement. Now, we must declare that no sacrifice is too great to eliminate the threat to freedom. No matter what the situation, we are willing to persevere through hardship until the day of victory. Simon then made two points regarding the debate in Parliament next week concerning the Norwegian war situation. First, based on the detailed information available to wartime cabinet members, he is confident that impartial public opinion, when understanding the full situation, will believe that the government's actions were appropriate and based on the best strategy. Second, if anyone singles out one or two cabinet members for criticism, or distinguishes between cabinet members, it will cause disappointment because, in fact, there is no room for such criticism. (Reuters, 8th)

London: Labour Party leader Attlee spoke at a dinner in London last night, saying, "I believe the people will demand brave, resolute, and efficient individuals to lead us through this difficult situation. I expect the people will respond. We in the labour movement will devote our abilities to this end. I believe that if the people are guaranteed that all sacrifices will be equal and without favouritism, they are prepared to make great sacrifices. I believe that Britain has not yet actively utilized its manpower and material resources. I also do not see that British land is fully utilized, or that private interests are subordinate to public welfare. Today is a time of great concern. The news of the British withdrawal from southern Norway is startling, and those who cherish extravagant hopes and do not understand the truth are particularly shocked. The Labour Party will demand a detailed explanation from the government on Wednesday. The British determination to defeat Hitlerism will not change due to another setback." (Reuters, 8th)

London: The Labour Party has recently published a new declaration of the Labour Party's wartime and post-war domestic policies, including the statement that a socialist Britain is not an unattainable utopia but an ideal nation that can be realized in our time. It also briefly outlines its plan, which it believes is necessary to achieve economic justice and social welfare, and states that it rejects any demands for dictatorship, whether from the left or the right. If public opinion is respected, we are confident that the history of parliamentary democracy can lead the nation forward from a society of acquisitiveness to a socialist society. (Reuters, 4th)

### Soviet Union Denies Making New Demands on Finland

Moscow: Some foreign newspapers claim that "the Soviet Union has suggested to Finland that it would like to exchange Vyborg for the Åland Islands." A Reuters report from Paris on May 1 stated that "the Soviet Union has proposed to Finland that it would like to return Hanko and Vyborg to Finland in exchange for the Åland Islands and Petsamo." TASS has recently been officially authorized to declare that the report is completely unfounded, every word of it is fabricated. (TASS, 4th)

Moscow: The new railway from Kandalaksha to Kirovsk was completed on April 30, thus connecting Kirovsk (a key Finnish town) to the Murmansk railway. (TASS, 4th)

### Netherlands Reaffirms Strict Neutrality; Multiple Nazi Party Members Arrested

Amsterdam: Dutch Prime Minister Gerbrandy recently broadcast to the nation, reaffirming his determination to maintain strict neutrality and resist any attack from any side to defend national independence, and stated that the army's preparedness is the best guarantee of national security. (Reuters, 4th)

Amsterdam: The Hague police have arrested several prominent Dutch Nazi Party members, including Dr. Tonningen, editor of the National Socialist Party's newspaper. (Reuters, 4th)

### Soviet and German Agreement to Uphold Swedish Neutrality; Developments in Swedish Policy Worth Watching

Moscow: Dutch newspapers and some foreign newspapers have recently claimed that "last week, the Soviet Union sent a note to the German government, stating that if Germany takes action against Sweden, the Soviet Union will consider it an unfriendly act. At the same time, the Soviet Union will not allow Germany to occupy the Åland Islands."

This report has been solemnly denied here by the authorities, and TASS has also been authorized to declare that the report does not correspond to the facts. In fact, two weeks ago, Soviet and German representatives exchanged information on the issue of Swedish neutrality in Moscow (this action was carried out in accordance with the provisions of Article 3 of the Soviet-German non-aggression pact for mutual exchange of information and discussion). During the exchange of information, both sides expressed their attention to upholding Swedish neutrality. (TASS, 4th)

London: It is reported that Sweden has begun trade negotiations with the Soviet Union and has requested Germany to use the Kiel Canal as a sea route for Swedish transportation to the United States and South America. (United Press, 4th)

London: Political figures here recently said that the withdrawal of Allied forces from the central Norwegian front has created a pessimistic impression in Sweden, and therefore the country may change its policy and try to establish an understanding with Germany. It is reported that the German government has proposed to Sweden that the two sides conclude a political and economic agreement to facilitate the transportation of Swedish iron ore to Germany and promote general relations between the two countries. How the Swedish government will respond is not yet known here. However, on the other hand, the Soviet Union supports Sweden's strict adherence to neutrality, and the Soviet Union would not be happy if Sweden became too close to Germany. Therefore, British authorities are paying attention to Moscow's reaction and closely monitoring the evolution of Swedish policy. (Havas, 3rd)

### Suspect Arrested for Plotting to Assassinate the British King

London: An engineer named Wyatt, about 38 years old, was arrested at Euston Station on Thursday evening, carrying an air rifle and a dagger.

### Romania Cracks Down on Tourist Entry

Bucharest: Romanian authorities are currently strictly cracking down on the entry of tourists. The residence permits of 240 German expatriates have been revoked, including some Germans who have lived in Romania for many years but are suspected of engaging in "Fifth Column" espionage activities. Several Saxons were arrested yesterday in Sibiu, a key city in the Saxon minority area, for harboring several tourists. It is reported that the authorities have determined that these tourists are German staff officers and have expelled them from the country. (Reuters, 4th)

### Allied Forces Still Plan to Continue Fighting in Northern Norway with Great Force; Norwegian Forces in Central Norway in Local Truce; Fierce Fighting Continues in Narvik

London: Responsible sources in London explicitly stated that although the Allied forces have withdrawn from northern Norway, they plan to continue fighting with great force. (Reuters, 4th)

London: A radio station here recently announced that the war in the port of Narvik is still raging. The focus of the war is in the town of Elveneset, south of the port. Allied reinforcements have already arrived to reinforce it. (Havas, 4th)

Stockholm: According to a local radio station, Colonel Getz, commander of the Norwegian forces in the Trondelag area (including the two districts of Trondheim, north and south, and Namsos), has issued an order announcing that he wants to request a local truce with the German forces. Because after the withdrawal of the Allied forces, the positions of the Norwegian forces in the Trondelag area are difficult to defend. Continuing to fight in this situation would only lead to tragedy and would be of no practical benefit. (Reuters, 4th)

Stockholm: The Jemtland Tidning newspaper published an order issued by Colonel Getz, commander of the Norwegian forces in the Trondelag area, which stated that the German forces have reached the flanks and rear of the defending forces. Since external assistance is impossible, and aircraft and other necessary weapons are lacking, continuing to fight would only cause unnecessary sacrifices for everyone. Therefore, he has made a proposal for a truce to the German commander. (Reuters, 4th)

London: The "Norwegian News Agency" declared that, according to a responsible source, the rumour that Colonel Getz, commander of the Norwegian forces in the Trondelag area, requested a truce is purely local in nature and only applies to the Norwegian forces under his command. (Reuters, 4th)

London: The British War Office recently announced that the Allied forces in Namsos, in accordance with the overall plan to withdraw from the vicinity of Trondheim, re-embarked on Thursday night and withdrew without loss. As for the northern port of Narvik, the enemy launched repeated counterattacks on the 1st and 2nd of this month, but were repulsed by the Allied forces, leaving behind many corpses and many prisoners of war. (Havas, 3rd)

London: According to responsible sources, Lieutenant General Paget, commander of the British Army in the Trondheim area, suggested in his plan for the withdrawal of the British Army from Åndalsnes that all Norwegian forces should withdraw together with the British forces and be transferred to other areas of operations decided by the Norwegian General Headquarters. The British authorities have agreed to this suggestion and issued the necessary instructions. However, how many Norwegian forces have been planned to be transferred to other places is not yet known in London. (Reuters, 4th)

London: The War Office recently issued a communiqué stating that "the rumour that the Norwegian Commander-in-Chief was unaware of the Allied withdrawal from the Trondheim area, and that he was negotiating a truce with the Germans, is not true. In fact, he and his staff boarded a British warship last night." (Havas, 3rd)

Stockholm: According to neutral military observers here, northern Norway is still an extremely important naval base for the Allied powers. If the Allied forces want to maintain their blockade of Germany and prevent German transportation in the Atlantic, the occupation of northern Norway is even more necessary when the German forces control central and southern Norway. The German forces have now achieved their first goal, which is to obtain a sea and air base to attack Britain and the North Sea. However, their second goal, which is to break the Allied blockade, may not be achieved for a while, as the area north of Bodø is still controlled by the Allied forces and the Norwegian army. Therefore, the Allied forces can mobilize the troops in that area to reoccupy and hold Narvik, which can also be assisted by the Norwegian 6th Division, which currently has more than 23,000 people.

German Merchant Ships Sunk in Norwegian Seaports by British Air Force; Stavanger German Airfield

### German Forces Continue to Advance Northward

Stockholm: According to news from Norway, the German forces in northern Norway are continuing to advance from Steinkjer to Grong (east of Namsos). They made contact with the Norwegian army in the vicinity of Snåsa, but stopped their advance because the commander of the Norwegian army near Trondheim had surrendered to the German forces there. In addition, fierce fighting between the German and Norwegian armies occurred in Røros and Ås in the east. (Havas, 4th)

### Allied Withdrawal Orderly

Stockholm: According to a reporter for the North Trondelag in Sweden, the British and French troops were as orderly as if they were on a parade ground when they boarded ships in Namsos. It is reported that after the troops gathered outside Namsos, they lined up to board ships at a temporary wooden pier, because the original one had been completely destroyed by German aircraft. The reporter also said that the British and French troops boarded the ships in an orderly manner and did not suffer much loss or difficulty due to German obstruction. (Reuters, 4th)

### Fighting in Snow Feels Like Hell

Åstersund: A Reuters correspondent reports that the situation of the British defenders holding the front line of Steinkjer is indeed like hell. They have been fighting in terrible conditions for a week, trudging through snow that is waist-deep. Their hands are frozen and they can hardly hold their guns. As soon as they leave their hidden trenches, they run the risk of being mercilessly machine-gunned by German aircraft. According to General Veale, his troops fought very bravely and slept in the snow at night until it was no longer possible to stand firm in Steinkjer. The correspondent also said that German aircraft dropped hundreds of incendiary bombs, turning Steinkjer into a fiery hell. It is impossible for any human being to remain there. The morale of the troops has never been seen to be discouraged. (Reuters, 4th)

### Norwegian Soldiers and Civilians Have the Determination to Resist to the End; General Headquarters Moved to a Safe Location; Isolated Surrender Unrelated to Main Forces

Stockholm: The Norwegian Telegraph Agency recently confirmed that King Haakon and his government are still in Norway. (Reuters, 4th)

Stockholm: The Norwegian Telegraph Agency recently issued a message stating that it is true that the results of the first phase of the war were disappointing, but the Norwegian people are well aware of the difficulties encountered by the Allied forces and therefore do not complain. Moreover, according to responsible authorities in the country, the fighting spirit of the army is very strong, and the determination of the whole country to resist to the end has not been diminished by this initial setback. As for the rumour that Colonel Munthe issued a notice to his subordinates, saying that after the withdrawal of the British and French troops from the central front, the situation of the Norwegian army was very dangerous and that the only option was to surrender to the German army, although this is a fact, the forces commanded by Munthe were only an isolated force near Trondheim and were not related to the main force of the Norwegian army. (Havas, 4th)

Stockholm: Although there has been no announcement from the Norwegian side regarding the current location of the Norwegian General Staff, confirmed reports say that the Norwegian army has moved its headquarters to a safer and more reliable strategic location in northern Norway. (United Press, 4th)

### German Airfield in Stavanger, Norway, Attacked Again; British Aircraft Dropped Bombs Like Rain, Causing a Large Fire That Lit Up the Sky

London: Responsible sources have declared that after a large squadron of British Blenheim aircraft attacked the German airfield in Stavanger, British aircraft returned to the airfield several hours later and dropped high-explosive bombs and incendiary bombs like rain. The airfield has become a "fiery hell." This was the ninth air raid on the airfield in two days. The German defenses were attacked, and their resistance was significantly weakened. Therefore, there was little resistance to this British attack. All of the bombs dropped by the British aircraft hit their targets, causing many large fires. Most of the houses around the aircraft landing area were burned down, and large fires were also seen to break out at other locations where German aircraft were parked. British aircraft also attacked Fornebu, where they encountered more resistance than before, with heavy anti-aircraft fire. The British aircraft dropped high-explosive bombs and incendiary bombs and saw four explosions near the main hangar, causing significant damage to the hangar. At the same time, British air force bombers patrolled the skies over the German Frisian Islands to prevent German seaplanes from flying far to the British coast to lay mines. These bombers encountered heavy anti-aircraft fire in several locations. When the British aircraft attacked, they saw three German aircraft and one fighter immediately flee. No British aircraft were injured or killed during last night's operations. (Reuters, 4th)

Oslo: The "People's Daily" here reports that it is difficult for British aircraft to achieve their objectives when attacking the Fornebu airfield near Oslo, because the airfield is made of stone and is not susceptible to aircraft bombing. (Haitong, 4th)

### British Interests in Mexico to Be Cared for by the Dutch Embassy

Mexico City: After Britain severed diplomatic relations with Mexico, all of its interests in Mexico were entrusted to the Danish Legation for care. According to reliable sources, the British have now changed to entrust the Dutch Legation for care. (Havas, 4th)

### Soviet Red Star Newspaper Comments on the Japanese Political Situation

Moscow: The Red Star newspaper, the organ of the People's Committee for Defense of the Soviet Union, today published a special article entitled "Disputes in the Japanese Ruling Camp," which stated that the Japanese political situation is extremely unstable and that some Japanese newspapers are predicting that the life of the Yonai Cabinet is nearing its end. Although the ruling class is trying to conceal the disputes in domestic politics, the government's crisis has proven its internal instability. The official propaganda that the Sino-Japanese war has made Japan "united" is actually a fabrication. Even Fumimaro Konoe and others have had to admit that differences of opinion have arisen in political circles. The so-called "unity of views on diplomacy and domestic politics" is nothing more than empty words. Japan's capitalist monopoly has no policy to speak of. If there is one, it only represents the conflict of interests between major enterprises and bankers. During this wartime period, the struggle between the financial and industrial sectors is particularly acute, and public dissatisfaction and anti-war movements have also occurred. These serious facts have all been caused by the war and cannot be denied by Japanese imperialists. (3rd)

### British Flagship Sunk by Bombing; London Has Not Confirmed

Berlin: The German High Command declared that on the afternoon of May 3, German aircraft attacked a British flagship west of Namsos. One heavy bomb hit between two forward turrets. Half a minute later, a flame rose from the ship to a height of 1,500 feet. Thick black smoke followed. After the smoke cleared, nothing was seen at the ship's location except for debris. (Reuters, 4th)

London: There is no confirmation here of the Berlin report that a British flagship was sunk west of Namsos on May 3. (Reuters, 4th)

### British-German Air Battle Over Borkum Island; One German Aircraft Shot Down

London: The British Air Ministry recently announced that a British reconnaissance aircraft and three German fighter aircraft engaged in an air battle near Borkum Island yesterday morning. One German aircraft was shot down, and the remaining two German aircraft fled in panic. The British machine gunner was killed, and the pilot and surveyor were injured but have safely returned. (Reuters, 4th)

London: Loud cannon fire was heard off the southeast coast of Britain last night, and the rumbling of aircraft was heard over the sea, indicating that German aircraft were attacking.

### Hong Kong to Ban Tungsten Ore Exports; Japan Negotiates with Britain

Tokyo: It is reported that the Hong Kong authorities are about to ban the export of tungsten. According to semi-official sources here, the Japanese government has instructed Ambassador to Britain Mamoru Shigemitsu to negotiate with the British side to ensure that the ore can continue to be shipped from Hong Kong to Japan. In addition, the export of nickel produced by the Canadian Federation, manganese, lead, jute, and scrap iron produced by India, and nickel produced by New Caledonia in French territory have all been banned. All of these are raw materials urgently needed by Japan. (Havas, 2nd)

### Japanese Government Plans to Control Trade

Tokyo: The Price Investigation Committee, jointly established by the Japanese Planning Board and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, met yesterday to discuss controlling Japan's export trade to China and "Manchukuo." It believes that the quantity of Japanese goods shipped to China and "Manchukuo" is staggering due to the soaring prices in Asia. It is urgent to control this. The export trade to North China should be rationalized. In other words, it should be limited to the supply of daily necessities such as cotton cloth, flour, seafood, grains, and building materials such as steel, wood, etc. In North China, efforts should be made to transport coal to Japan.

### Southwest Provinces Rich in Gold Mines: Survey of the Resource Committee

Chongqing Correspondence: Although China's gold mines do not have a single exceptionally rich area, their distribution is extremely wide. In the past, it was generally believed that the three northeastern provinces and Xikang were gold-producing regions. However, after investigations by the Resource Committee and other parties in recent years, it has been discovered that many other provinces also have gold resources.

The important gold-producing areas in northern China used to be Mohe, Heihe, Suifenhe, and Aihun in Heilongjiang Province; Sannianhe and Jiapigou in Jilin Province; and Tieling, Bailegou, and the Xing'an region in Liaoning Province. Now it is known that there are also Pingquan and Chaoyang in Rehe Province; Xinglong Daoliushui and Malanta in Zunhua; Miyun and Changping in Hebei Province; and Zhaoyuan, Yishui, and Linyi in Shandong Province. As for the southwestern and northwestern provinces, the important gold-producing areas include Songpan and Suijing in Sichuan Province; Yanyuan, Mianning, Kangding, and Daofu in Xikang Province; Dieyuan and Ledu in Qinghai Province; Taoyuan, Yuanling, and Pingjiang in Hunan Province; and Shanglin and Wuming in Guangxi Province. In addition, placer gold deposits have been found along the river basins of the Minjiang, Tuojiang, Jialingjiang, Dadu River, and Jinsha River in Sichuan Province; the Nujiang, Lancangjiang, and Jinsha River in Yunnan Province; the Datong River and Huang River in Qinghai Province; the Han River in Shaanxi and Hubei Provinces; and the Dan River in Henan Province.

Southwest Provinces: Gold Mine Areas

Sichuan Province has many placer gold mines, and their distribution is very wide. Several state-owned mining areas have been designated in the Zhangla area of Songpan County for exploration and mining. According to statistics, the average annual output is about 20,000 taels.

In Xikang Province, several state-owned mining areas have also been designated in Kangding, Taining, Daofu, and Yuhe for preliminary exploitation. According to statistics from the past two years, the annual output is about 20,000 taels.

Hunan Province has many mountain gold mines, and the area is very large. Under the joint operation of the provincial and central governments, the annual output is at least 12,000 taels.

In Qinghai Province, several state-owned mining areas have been surveyed in Yuan County, Yong'an City, Zhuanfeng Kiln, and Shipozhuang in Ledu County for exploration and mining. In addition, state-owned areas have also been surveyed in Xiakou in Gonghe County, Hualong Kejiangou in Hualong County, and Xiamen in Minhe County, and trial explorations have begun. There is recent hope of success. The gold output in this area is 10,000 taels per year.

In Guangxi Province, Shanglin County is the most prominent, with an annual gold output of over 30,000 taels. The gold mines in Guangdong Province are mostly barren, with an annual gold output of only about 2,000 taels.

In addition, there has been no detailed survey of gold mines in Guizhou Province, but gold mines in Fanjing Mountain in Jiangkou County and Xiajiang County are also being mined, producing several hundred taels. In Yunnan Province, there are relatively rich mineral beds on the banks of the Nujiang, Jinsha River, and Lancangjiang Rivers, and the province produces about 2,000 taels per year. In Gansu Province, the most important area is on the northern slopes of the Qilian Mountains, where the annual gold output is very small. In Yun County, Hubei Province, Ankang County, Shaanxi Province, Xichuan County, Henan Province, Liuzhougou and Jingziguan, etc., in the Han and Dan River basins, there are also placer gold mines, which are mined using traditional methods, with an annual output of more than 2,000 taels. There are also gold mines in Xinjiang Province, but there are no accurate reports on output, but it is at least over 22,000 taels per year.

The above are not very detailed surveys, because all the mining areas are in places with inconvenient transportation and in areas of indigenous chieftains. It is believed that there are many undiscovered rich gold mines, so surveying gold mines is a very important task at present.

Gold Mining Enterprises: Generally Divided into Three Types

Gold mining enterprises are generally divided into three types: one is government-run mines, the second is privately-run mines, and the third is free panning and mining by the people.

Government-run mines are operated in cooperation with the Resource Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the provincial governments, or independently operated. There are a total of six gold mining bureaus, located in Xikang, Sichuan, Qinghai, Hunan, Henan, and Guangxi Provinces. The gold mines in Kangding, Taining, Daofu, and Yuhe in Xikang are managed by the Xikang Gold Mining Bureau. The Songpan gold mine in Sichuan is managed by the Sichuan Gold Mining Office. The gold mines in Yuan and Le in Qinghai, and the six gold mines being explored in Hualong, Gonghe, Xueshan, Datong, Xian, and Ahatu Shalong, are managed by the Qinghai Gold Mining Office. The gold mines in Taoyuan, Yuanling, and Pingjiang in Hunan are managed by the Hunan Gold Mining Exploration Team. The Shanglin gold mine in Guangxi is managed by the Pinggui Mining Department. The gold mines in Zhechuan and Jingziguan in Henan are managed by the Henan Gold Mining Exploration Team.

In addition, there are privately-run mines that have licenses and mining rights approved by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. In the 27th year of the Republic (1938), the government issued 56 new gold mining permits. In addition, there are many groups and individuals who have not applied for permits, totaling 150,000 troy ounces of gold mined by registered gold mining organizations in the 27th year. As of the end of March of the 28th year (1939), 102 privately-run gold mines have been approved and licensed, including 18 in Guangdong Province, 6 in Guangxi Province, 1 in Xikang Province, 2 in Yunnan Province, 2 in Jiangxi Province, 56 in Sichuan Province, and 17 in Hunan Province. Among them, 60 were approved before the end of the 26th year (1937). Therefore, the increase rate of privately-run licensed gold mines in the past ten months has been 140%. According to statistics from July of the 27th year to May of the 28th year, the four banks, Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Agricultural Bank of China, purchased 143,000 troy ounces of pure gold from gold miners in various places. If this batch of gold is calculated at 200 yuan per troy ounce, its total value would be 28.6 million yuan. If this number is added to the 40,000 to 50,000 troy ounces purchased or collected privately, then the total output would be around 190,000 troy ounces, which is better than the previous annual average output of 130,000 troy ounces. From these two points, we can also see that the gold mining industry in China is moving forward. If thorough exploration and full use of machinery for mining can be achieved, then the future of the gold mining industry in China will be even more limitless.

### Today is the May 5th Revolutionary Day: All Circles in Shanghai Hang Flags in Celebration; City Party Headquarters Issues a Message to the Public, Encouraging All Circles to Emulate the Spirit of the Premier

Today is the anniversary of Sun Premier taking office as the Extraordinary Grand Marshal and the establishment of the Revolutionary Government. In the tenth year of the Republic (1921), the warlords were fighting internally, and the powers were invading externally. The people's livelihood was difficult, and the country was in danger. Premier Sun, in order to save the nation from danger and carry out the Republican revolution, disregarded the difficulties of the environment and resolutely took office as the Extraordinary Grand President on May 5th, continuing to shoulder the great cause of the revolution. This was the establishment of the Revolutionary Government, the foundation for the later Northern Expedition and the pacification of the country. All circles in the city believe that with the national crisis at hand, the War of Resistance and nation-building are waiting to be continued. In addition to hanging flags in celebration today in accordance with the methods agreed upon by the public organizations and the concession authorities, they will also emulate the lofty and great revolutionary character of the Premier, resolutely struggle, fulfill their national responsibilities, and jointly solve the national crisis and the tribulations of the nation.

City Party Headquarters Issues a Message to the Public

Today is the May 5th Revolutionary Memorial Day.

The Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters issued a message to the public, stating: "May 5th" is the anniversary of our party's Premier Sun Yat-sen taking office as the Extraordinary Grand President. In our opinion, this "Double Fifth Festival" has the same great significance as the "Double Tenth Festival" (National Day). Because at that time, the Beiyang warlords were engaged in all kinds of lawless acts, all kinds of oppression of the people, all kinds of collusion with imperialists, and the betrayal of Chen Jiongming and others hindered the national revolution, causing chaos and bringing the country to the brink of collapse. Premier Sun was heartbroken by this situation and, based on his great fearless spirit, established the Revolutionary Government, took office as the Extraordinary Grand President, shouldered the heavy burden of the revolution, did not compromise, did not fear difficulties, and fought against the evil forces from all sides, and finally succeeded in the great cause of the revolution. Therefore, if there had been no "Double Fifth Festival" in the tenth year of the Republic, the "Double Tenth Festival" of the Xinhai Revolution would have been abandoned long ago. However, the current situation is even more terrible than in the tenth year of the Republic. When we commemorate the "Double Fifth Festival" at this time, we should emulate the fighting spirit of Premier Sun in creating the "Double Fifth Festival," firmly believe in Premier Sun's Three Principles of the People—National Salvationism, not yield, not be afraid of death, and under the wise and brilliant leadership of Generalissimo Chiang, firmly believe in the belief that the War of Resistance will be won and the nation will be built, continue to work hard, intensify our work, and only then can we be loyal followers of the Three Principles of the People. Look, Japan's economy is collapsing, Japan's politics are shaking, and Japan's army is about to be destroyed. This puppet show is a reflection of its decline. As long as the righteousness and blood of our 450 million people unite as one and build a steel-like battle line, desperately attack, and the light will be in front of our eyes.

The Great Alliance Encourages Loyal Comrades

Also, the Great Alliance of Loyal Comrades of the Kuomintang of China also issued a message to the compatriots, saying, On this day in the tenth year of the Republic of China, our party established the Revolutionary Government in Guangdong, and the Premier took office as the President, announced the protection of the Constitution, and revealed the great plan for national salvation, which is a bright and glorious page in our country's history. Looking back on the past and looking forward to the future, it is inspiring. Today, our country is in a difficult situation, even more so than in the past. Our President leads the whole people in striving for freedom, equality, and peace. His great achievements reflect each other. We should all strive to participate directly or indirectly in the work of resisting Japan and building the nation under the leadership of our party President and strengthen the forces of resisting Japan and building the nation.

### Deliberating on Suppressing the Price of Briquettes Actually Leads to a Quorum Failure, Causing Panic; Responsibility Lies Where It Should

The fourth term of the Shanghai Mechanical Briquette Industry Association's cheap briquette sale is scheduled to end today. The association was originally scheduled to hold a joint meeting of factories at 3:00 PM yesterday to discuss whether to continue the cheap sale and to have a public discussion on the re-increase in the price of briquettes. However, only representatives from 13 small briquette factories, such as Public, Yixin, and Beiyang, attended at the time of the meeting, so it had to be postponed.

Stop Selling First Upon Price Increase

The Shanghai Coal and Firewood Industry Federation sent a letter to the Public Concession Public Works Department and the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating that, according to reports from fuel retailers, major briquette factories announced that the amount of briquettes sold was full and stopped supplying retailers with briquettes from yesterday (2nd), resulting in a shortage of briquettes on the market and causing panic among users. It is requested that the authorities take measures to provide relief. In the past, before the price of millet briquettes increased, briquette factories would supply a considerable amount of briquettes to retailers to help the market and facilitate the retail purchase of users. However, now, when the price increases, the factories stop selling first, regardless of the lives of the citizens, and deliberately create a situation of panic. Their intentions are obvious.

Sudden Increase in Factory Prices Reveals Intentions

As for the factories' claim yesterday that the cost is huge and the factory price has suddenly increased, the purchase of coal dust is definitely not less than before this price increase. There is no reason for the cost to be high. It is heard that the daily production of briquettes in a certain large factory is more than 200 to 300 tons, but this morning it announced to retailers that it would only supply 20 tons. It is obvious that the sudden increase in factory prices and the reduction in production are intended to hoard goods. The association believes that briquettes are a daily necessity for citizens and are related to the livelihoods of member stores. It is earnestly requested that your bureau (association) promptly persuade the briquette factories to suppress the market price and supply goods as usual to stabilize the market.

### The Public Works Department Uses New Public Bonds to Purchase 100,000 Pounds of British Gold; It is Sufficient to Meet the British Pound Needs for This Year

The English-language "Great American Evening News" reported that it had learned that the Public Works Department had converted a portion of its new public bonds into British pounds before the recent depreciation of the legal tender. It purchased 50,000 pounds of British gold with cash on Monday at an exchange rate of four pence one two five. It also purchased 50,000 pounds on Tuesday. Together with the 100,000 pounds purchased at the beginning of this year, it is sufficient to meet the British pound needs in the Public Works Department's budget for this year. As for the remaining proceeds from the public bonds, part has been used to repay bank overdrafts, and some has been set aside as working capital. According to Mr. Mu Qiu, Director of Finance of the Public Works Department, the depreciation of the legal tender on Thursday was unexpected. Therefore, he was very pleased to have purchased British gold before the depreciation of the legal tender.

### Restrictions on Withdrawals Will Not Be Realized; Shanghai's Financial Stability; Sanctions on Speculation Are a Matter of Great Urgency; Foreign Exchange Evasion by the Japanese Puppet Regime Has Been Crushed

Since the fluctuations in the black market for foreign exchange a few days ago, some people with ulterior motives have been deliberately disrupting the market, causing more and more panic. Yesterday, it happened to be Saturday, and rumors suddenly spread in the market that there would be restrictions on withdrawals. For a time, there were crowds of people rushing to withdraw money in front of major banks and money shops. Fortunately, the banks and money shops responded appropriately, and no accidents occurred. According to a financial authority yesterday, although the Shanghai financial market has been extremely chaotic recently, it is all caused by speculators deliberately disrupting the market. As for restrictions on withdrawals, although theoretically possible, they will not be realized in practice. There are three reasons for this: (1) The situation this year is different from last year. According to the general situation, the more restrictions on withdrawals, the more withdrawals there will be, and the result is more likely to cause panic. (2) Banks and money shops were very nervous in mid-June of last year because of the sudden occurrence of the event. This year, because they are prepared, they are sufficient to cope and do not need restrictions. (3) The black price of foreign exchange is now seeking its natural level and has not yet reached an absolute stable period. There will be no good results if withdrawals are restricted at this time. In short, everyone in the market knows that the tension is caused by speculative forces, and curbing speculation depends on everyone understanding their own position and defending together. According to the principles of currency and prices, when currency is concentrated in the hands of financial institutions and can be used properly, speculative funds can be reduced. On the contrary, if currency is withdrawn from financial institutions, the need for chips will increase, and the rate of circulation will also increase, making it difficult to reconcile the supply and demand of materials, which is equivalent to suicide. Some citizens only know that speculators are disrupting the market, but they do not know that curbing speculators is precisely the effort of their own efforts.

Committee Members of the Stabilization Committee Expressed

Mr. Stern, a British member of the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee, recently came to Shanghai from Hong Kong. According to him, the committee has not released British pounds in recent times to maintain the value of the black exchange rate, because China's foreign trade surplus has been quite large recently, and remittances from overseas Chinese have been very frequent even after the Chinese Lunar New Year. In March, remittances to China reached 35 million US dollars. According to Mr. Stern, Shanghai's industrialization has gradually shown signs of recovery in recent times, and since the outbreak of the European War last year, the export business has been particularly vigorous. This can be seen in last year's Shanghai Customs report. This spring, Shanghai's international trade increased by 88.8% compared to the same period in 1939, and in the summer, there will be significant increases in cotton textiles and other manufactured goods. Therefore, there is a good chance that the Shanghai market will improve.

Cracking Down on Foreign Exchange Evasion by the Japanese Puppet Regime

Regarding the recent fluctuations in the black exchange market in this city, a highly authoritative source close to the financial authorities expressed the opinion that although the black exchange rate has fallen sharply this time, the legal foreign exchange of the Central Bank still maintains the original price of one shilling and two and a half pence. This time, the Japanese puppet regime engaged in a large amount of foreign exchange evasion in the black market in this city. In order to crack down on this conspiracy, the authorities have appropriately restricted the supply. This economic strategy is sufficient to reduce the foreign exchange gains of the large amount of legal tender that the Japanese puppet regime has plundered or seized in the occupied areas. In principle, the Chinese government can absolutely stop the expenditure of Shanghai's black exchange, but the reason for its painstaking maintenance is to take into account the trade interests of third countries such as Britain and the United States.

Painstakingly Taking Into Account British and American Trade

If the Chinese government completely stops supplying Shanghai's black exchange, it will consolidate the financial foundation during the War of Resistance and be beneficial to wartime finance. First, the cessation of improper foreign exchange expenditure will reduce the outflow of funds in China, while Japan will not be able to obtain foreign exchange from the legal tender it has plundered. Second, it will prevent unnecessary imports of foreign goods, increase the export of local goods, and not only balance the national financial revenue and expenditure, but also absorb foreign exchange from abroad. However, in view of the trade with China by third countries, it is only restricting the supply and lowering the black exchange rate.

Financial Institutions Are Becoming More Sound

Therefore, the sharp contraction of the black exchange rate this time can indeed crack down on the foreign exchange evasion of the Japanese puppet regime and is not the depletion of the Equalization Fund, nor is it the devaluation of the legal tender. The Equalization Fund has not only not been depleted, but it has been decided to increase it. The reserve of the legal tender is also very sufficient, and in the future, the foundation of the legal tender will become more stable due to the reduction of foreign exchange outflow and the increase of international trade export. This is unanimously recognized by those with economic common sense. Therefore, the Chinese financial institutions will become more sound, and the national funds will become more abundant, which is beneficial to the great cause of resisting Japan and building the nation.

Concession Notice; Appropriate Measures

As for the high price of goods in this city, it is caused by general speculators raising the price of goods without authorization and is by no means the devaluation of the legal tender. These speculators are obviously taking advantage of the current special situation in the concession, where the government's authority cannot reach, and they are seeking profit, unscrupulous, and crazy, and are harming the country. Although the black exchange rate has fallen sharply, there is no reason to raise the market price immediately, whether it is foreign goods or domestic goods. This kind of profit is also illegally obtained. The immediate emergency notice of the two concessions to crack down on illegal price increases is very appropriate.

### The French Ship "Far East" Will Change its Route

French Ships Sailing in the Mediterranean are Not Allowed to Stop in Syria

French ships sailing on European and Far Eastern routes have had erratic schedules since the start of the European War. It is learned that the French authorities have many needs for shipping during this time of war. Therefore, French ships sailing in European countries have been suspended and requisitioned for other purposes. Those sailing on Far Eastern routes, with the exception of pure cargo ships, are scheduled to depart monthly in order to maintain service. However, due to the reduced number of ships during wartime, services will be further delayed. It is impossible to predict when ships will arrive in Shanghai, but services will not be discontinued. The reason for this is that routes will likely be changed. However, the company has not yet received official notice. According to shipping industry sources, in the past two months, French ships sailing in the Mediterranean have been ordered not to stop in French-owned Syria in Turkey. Passengers are forbidden from disembarking there. In the past, many overseas Chinese traveling to France went to Syria. However, due to the disruption of shipping, foreigners traveling there have also disappeared.

### The "Ding" Category of the Unified Public Bond Will Be Drawn for Repayment

Scheduled for the 10th; Payment at the End of July

The ninth repayment lottery for the A, B, C, D, and E bonds of the 25th year of the Republic of China (1936) Unified Public Bond has been held by the National Debt Fund Management Committee since February. The A, B, and C bonds have now been drawn. The D bonds are scheduled to be drawn at 10:00 AM on the 10th of this month. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and others have been requested to send representatives to supervise at that time. Cash payments will be made through the four banks, Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Agricultural Bank of China, starting at the end of July.

### The Detention of the "Lisheng" Ship in Tianjin is of Great Significance; The Case of Smuggling Banknotes Can Be Concluded, But the Other Person Involved Has Not Been Released

The "Lisheng" ship of Jardine Matheson, a British company, was seized by customs in Tianjin for smuggling tens of thousands of Japanese banknotes and silver dollars and was detained for investigation. It was released on the 28th and sailed back to Shanghai, arriving in port at 8:00 PM the day before yesterday (the 3rd) and docking at the Roosevelt Wharf in the French Concession.

Japanese Soldiers Search

It was learned yesterday that the ship, on its return voyage from Tianjin to Shanghai, sailed from Tianjin at 8:00 AM on the 22nd of last month and arrived at the Dalian Company Wharf near Tanggu (approximately 10:00 AM), where it docked as usual. A search was conducted by customs. During the search, many Japanese military police officers and customs search personnel boarded the ship at the same time. Approximately 38,000 yuan in Japanese banknotes, silver dollars, legal tender, and "joint banknotes" were seized on the spot. Two boatswains and six sailors were arrested on the spot.

Special Items

In addition, special items were discovered by the Japanese military police in the bathroom and toilet on the upper deck. The mess hall supervisor and the comprador leader were arrested. At the same time, the first and second compradors were also summoned to the Japanese military police headquarters for interrogation. The first and second compradors were released that night. The Japanese party responsible second comprador returned to the ship to investigate and said that they would come to the ship again at 10:00 AM the next day (the 23rd) for questioning. However, the second comprador returned to the ship and found nothing. At 10:00 AM the next morning, the Japanese military police did come to investigate again, but still found nothing.

Repeated Interrogations

The second comprador was taken away again, and after several days of interrogation, there was no confession. Afterwards, the chef's assistant in the mess hall kitchen was arrested. At 12:00 AM on the 27th, the first and second compradors, one boatswain, and two sailors were released and returned to the ship. The ship then departed from Tianjin at noon on the 28th and arrived in Shanghai at 8:00 PM the night before last. The ship was detained in Tianjin for about a week. Four sailors, one boatswain, one supervisor, and one assistant are still being detained at the Japanese military police headquarters.

Unpredictable Future

It is rumored that the sailors and boatswain are suspected of smuggling Japanese banknotes and silver dollars and can be dealt with after being detained for several months. However, the future of the supervisor and one assistant, due to special reasons, cannot be predicted. The torture suffered by the Chinese crew members of the ship when they were interrogated at the Japanese military police headquarters was unbearable by humans. This kind of pain is difficult to describe with words.

### British Consul-General Instructs British Overseas Chinese that They Should Await Orders to Participate in the War; Sir George Gave an Impromptu Speech; Major General Simmons and Others Attended

At the St. Andrews seat on Thursday, Sir George, the British Consul-General in Shanghai, and Major General Simmons, the British military commander, attended. The British Consul-General gave an impromptu speech, stating that British Overseas Chinese in Shanghai should await government orders to go to the battlefield to serve. Sir Sassoon and Counselor Mo Su, the Canadian Trade Representative, attended the banquet that day.

### Shipping Merchants Are Not Interested in Opening the Blockade Line

Japanese Side has Notified All Places and Determined to Open It on the 15th

According to a Japanese naval spokesman on the 3rd, the blockade line in the South City of the Huangpu River will be opened to third-country ships starting on the 15th of this month, and the Huangpu River water area will be opened. Ships with a draft of more than seven meters are prohibited from navigating to the five-kilometer point adjacent to the upstream Skink Shipyard near the South City blockade line. Ships with a draft of three to seven meters should navigate on the central waterway. The time of passage is from morning to evening. It is said that the blockade was set up by the Chinese authorities who sank sand ships during the August 13th Shanghai War. The Japanese side has now cleared it. As for the designation of berths inside the water city after the opening, it must be decided through negotiations between the Customs Port Affairs Department and the Japanese Navy Port Affairs Authority. All third-country ships must pass through without hindering the Japanese military principles. Mr. Miura, the Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, has sent letters to the Shanghai authorities and relevant parties regarding this opening message. However, because the business inside the blockade line is limited and they must be controlled by the Japanese side, and the Japanese army has the right to impose a military blockade at any time, many shipping merchants are wary and are not interested in the Japanese side's promises.

### The Jianghai Customs Quarantine Fee is Doubled

Due to Rising Prices of Needed Items

The Jianghai Customs Port Affairs Department announced that, in view of the fact that the foreign exchange rate of the legal tender has fallen sharply, and the prices of imported raw materials and chemicals required by the Shanghai Customs Quarantine Station have increased, it was previously stipulated that a 30% increase should be calculated, as stated in Notice No. 7 of August 1st of the 28th year (1939). Now, due to the continued increase in the price of imported goods used in the work of the Quarantine Station, it is decided that from May 1st of this year, all the aforementioned fees will be temporarily calculated by doubling the original regulations. All shipping companies and passengers are hereby notified.

### It is Rumored that All Ports in Chongming Have Been Blockaded

Searching for Guerrilla Forces; The Result is Ineffective

Chinese guerrilla forces are extremely active in the coastal areas of the two counties of Pudong and Nanhui Chuansha and on Chongming Island outside Songkou. Whether day or night, they openly sail boats to and from the sea, either transferring defenses or transporting military supplies. The Japanese side has no way to deal with it. It is now heard that the Japanese navy has searched for the whereabouts of the guerrilla forces several times without success. Recently, all ports in Chongming, such as Xisha, Baigang, and Haihonggang, have been blockaded, and ships are prohibited from passing through these ports. Only the ports where the original Chongming liner enters and exits can operate as usual to maintain transportation between Shanghai and Chongming. In general observation, the Chongming coast is vast, and this move is unlikely to be effective.

### Pujiang Dredging Begins on a Small Scale

Reports circulating outside indicate that the resumption of dredging work on Shanghai's Huangpu River is being carried out on a smaller scale than reported. It has been learned that the dredging operations within the Pujiang River can now be described as commencing on a small scale. The current work location is below Lujiazui in the Pujiang River, where several large dredgers are tasked with the excavation project. The "Jianshe" large dredger is currently anchored in the heart of the river opposite the Xin Kai River, as the bureau has assigned workers to conduct repairs on the ship, which are not yet completed. As for the dredging of Shentan shoal, there are currently no plans to resume it.

### Jinpu Railway Bridge Damaged by Guerrillas; Passengers Must Walk to Jinan; Foreigners in This City Experienced It Personally

The Continental Daily reports that several foreigners from this city, traveling south on the Jinpu Railway express, arrived in Shanghai yesterday (the 3rd). According to their account, on Thursday night, while their train was near Jinan, Shandong, due to the activity of Chinese guerrillas, a railway bridge and a large section of track had been

damaged.

Therefore, they had no choice but to disembark and walk for about a mile to change trains. The destroyed bridge was located about two hours south of Jinan by train, but the exact location is unknown, as the train stopped late at night. When the express train reached the section of track that had been pried up, all the passengers

disembarked and walked.

They saw a large number of Japanese railway workers repairing the damaged tracks and roadbed, using gasoline welding torches to weld the rails one by one, clearly attempting to prevent the guerrillas from prying up the rails again. The bombed railway bridge was quite long and severely damaged and is

under urgent repair. Passengers walked for about a mile before reaching the intact railway, where they boarded another train to Bengbu, and then changed trains to Pukou. Among these foreign passengers were Ms. Weil, a buyer for a large department store in Chicago, and employees of the British American Tobacco Company.

The Shanghai Public Health Society held its fifth annual congress this year on the 2nd of this month at the Ge's Biological Research Institute at 18 Ferguson Road. Over a hundred members and guests from all walks of life attended. Representatives from the Shanghai Municipal Council Health Department, the Pasteur Institute, major public health organizations, and prominent doctors were present to observe. They praised the institute's comprehensive sanitary facilities and were particularly impressed by the various scientific instruments designed and manufactured by the institute's director. After lunch, a scientific discussion was held on the lawn of the institute. A paper by Dr. Xu Liangdong, a member, was read by the society's secretary. The paper detailed the spread of plague in Guangxi and the plight of victims unable to obtain effective medicine, providing a detailed report. It also covered the successful trial of the live rat vaccine he developed, with over 20,000 people having already been injected with the vaccine, each experiencing positive results. Following this, Director Ge screened various films he had personally shot, presenting to the guests step-by-step demonstrations of the production of diphtheria antitoxin, Schick toxin, and various preventive vaccines. The lighting was soft, the editing appropriate, and the demonstration of the progress of scientific research, placing the preparation of biological drugs on the right track of scientific management, deeply impressed all the guests. The fifth congress of the Public Health Society concluded successfully in an atmosphere of joy and harmony.

### The April Cost of Living Index for Workers in This City; Prices Hover, but Cloth Prices Rise Sharply

The general cost of living index for workers in Shanghai in April remained relatively stable, at 364.72, a slight decrease of 3.36 points, or 0.91%. The clothing index, however, increased sharply, reaching 342.18, a rise of 18.36%. However, since clothing expenses constitute a very small proportion of a worker's total household consumption, and the food index (357.43) decreased slightly by 2.11% compared to the previous month, the overall index did not increase. The fuel index was 470.76, down 0.81% from the previous month, and the miscellaneous items index was 285.97, up 0.37%. The purchasing power of currency this month was 27.42 cents of the legal tender for one yuan of 1936.

Rice Prices: This month, rice prices did not fluctuate much compared to the previous month. Saigon rice rose by 2.28%, while japonica rice and glutinous rice fell by 0.13% and 6.50% respectively. Vegetable and fish prices decreased significantly, causing the food index to decline.

Cloth Prices: Due to the appreciation of foreign exchange rates this month, cloth prices increased sharply. In addition, active speculation in the cotton market further fueled the price increases. The prices of all items under clothing increased, with coarse cloth, bleached cloth, flannel, and twill cloth increasing by more than 20% compared to the previous month.

Coal Prices: The price of coal briquettes increased twice this month, first from 6.60 yuan per load to 7 yuan, and then to 7.40 yuan. On average, it increased by 13.94% compared to the previous month. The prices of firewood and charcoal decreased by 12.82% and 6.41%, respectively.

### Two Robberies Yesterday; Detectives and Bandits Engaged in a Fierce Gunfight; Cotton Mill Employee Killed While Carrying Money; One Doorman Arrested and Killed

Five Robbers Raid a Furniture Store and Engage in a Fierce Gunfight; Four Robbers Arrested, One Killed, Western Detectives and Two Passersby Injured

Yesterday at 3:20 PM, a robbery occurred at the west end of Ningbo Road and Henan Road. Police and robbers exchanged gunfire five times, resulting in two deaths at the scene. The robber was injured and arrested. Additionally, at approximately 7:45 PM last night, five robbers suddenly broke into the Zhang Linji Furniture Store at 201-206 South Wuxi Road, threatening and intimidating the shop assistants and looting at will. Fortunately, a female employee shouted for help, and the neighbors reported it to the police station. Police cars quickly arrived at the scene, and Chinese and Western detectives forced their way in, leading to a fierce gunfight between detectives and robbers. Around 30 to 40 shots were fired, resulting in four robbers being captured, one killed, and one injured. Stray bullets also injured two male and female passersby. Our reporter has investigated and will provide detailed information below.

Employee Carrying Money Robbed En Route

Yesterday afternoon at approximately 3:00 PM, the Hongji Cotton Mill at 12 Jingxing Lane, Tianjin Road, sent an employee, Sheng Yinghua, to the Salt Industry Bank on Beijing Road to withdraw 1,000 yuan, and then to the Yongda Money Exchange at 24 Ningbo Road to withdraw 2,000 yuan, for a total of 4,000 yuan in legal tender. He wrapped the money in newspaper and carried it west. When he passed Henan Road, a robber suddenly jumped out from the side of the road, forcibly snatched the newspaper package, and fled. Sheng closely followed, shouting while running. Realizing the situation was dire, the robber turned around and fired a shot, hitting Sheng in the chest. Sheng continued to chase despite the pain. The robber fired another shot, hitting him in the right chest, causing him to collapse to the ground in agony, bleeding profusely. He died shortly after.

One Arresting Officer Killed in the Pursuit of Robbers

As the robber fled to the entrance of the Money Exchange Association, he was spotted by Wang Shousen, a Tianjin native and doorman of the association, who realized he was a criminal. He immediately drew his gun and gave chase. The robber passed through Jingxing Lane to 208 Tianjin Road, seeking refuge in the Qiantai Inn. The doorman pursued him, but the robber, to preemptively strike, opened fire on the arresting officer. The officer returned fire, and the two exchanged five or six shots. Wang, disregarding his safety, was shot in a vital area and died on the spot in the Qiantai Inn's courtyard.

Police Arrive, Robber Captured

Seeing the doorman dead, the robber attempted to escape. At this time, the police station received the alarm and immediately dispatched red police cars with detectives to track him down. The robber fled out of the Qiantai Inn and turned into 166 Fuxue Lane in the Lihua Silk and Cloth Shop. He rushed into the back room and quickly climbed to the second floor. Fortunately, the vigilant patrol officer in charge of Lane 766 immediately closed the lane gate to prevent the robber's escape. Detectives then captured the robber. The robber was found to have a gunshot wound on his left foot, and was only about twenty years old, wearing a gray suit. Detectives also captured two suspects nearby and brought them back to the police station for further investigation.

Five Robbers Suddenly Enter the Furniture Store

Zhang Mulin, a man from Pudong in his sixties, has operated the Zhang Linji Furniture Store at 204-206 South Wuxi Road for over forty years, and his business is thriving. At approximately 7:45 PM last night, after the shop had closed for the day, five robbers knocked on the door and entered, falsely claiming to be searching for the young master's firearms. One robber stood guard at the entrance, while the remaining robbers rushed into the shop, threatening and intimidating the nine workers and apprentices inside, tying them up one by one with ropes, and assigning one armed robber to watch over them.

Vigilant Maid Climbs to the Roof and Shouts for Help

Another robber was stationed by the staircase downstairs, while two robbers went upstairs, threatening the male and female owners with guns and beginning to loot. They snatched a diamond ring, 350 yuan in cash, two watches, a gold ring, and a gold gun piece from a foreign suitcase, with an estimated value of over 2,000 yuan. As the robbers carried the loot downstairs, their greed proved insatiable, and the two robbers went back upstairs, intending to demand more. Fortunately, a maid named Gao Sanzi (36 years old, employed for only over a month) secretly climbed onto the roof and shouted for help to the Yuantai Chang Cigarette Paper Store across the street. The store assistant used the telephone to report to the Zhabei Police Station.

Police Cars Arrive, Gunfight Ensues

Shortly after, a police car arrived, carrying dozens of armed Chinese, Western, and Indian police officers. They first cut off traffic at all surrounding intersections. A Western detective took the lead, forcing his way into the Zhang Linji Furniture Store. Detectives then swarmed in. At that time, one unarmed robber standing guard inside the door noticed the large number of detectives arriving and hid beside the furniture. The detectives did not initially notice him and rushed upstairs. The robbers upstairs, realizing they were exposed, drew their guns and resisted arrest. The detectives returned fire, and the two sides exchanged thirty to forty shots, leading to a fierce gunfight.

One Robber Killed, Four Robbers Captured

One robber, shot twice in the abdomen, jumped out of a back window, fleeing in pain to the Zhu Xinchang Clothing Store in the back alley, where he collapsed, bleeding profusely. He died shortly after. A portion of the stolen goods, including 58 yuan in legal tender, a gold ring, two watches, and a gold key piece, was found in his pocket. Another robber, Gong Zhitang, 20 years old, sustained gunshot wounds to his hands and feet and was taken to the police hospital for treatment. The remaining three robbers were arrested at the store. A Western police officer also sustained a gunshot wound to his hand. Two male and female passersby, Ji Yichang (30 years old), were shot in the head, neck, and left shoulder, and Zhao Li (26 years old), was shot in the back. They were taken to Renji Hospital for treatment.

### Robbery on Ximen Road

At approximately 8:30 PM last night, four robbers broke into the Xie Da Egg Store on Ximen Road in the French Concession. Three of them were armed with pistols. They threatened and intimidated the staff, resulting in the theft of 3,000 yuan in legal tender. They fled with the stolen goods without a trace. The store owner reported the incident to the Lujiawan Police Station and requested an investigation.

### Carrying a Large Quantity of Opium

Sun Desan, a 38-year-old from Tianjin, was found carrying 550 grams of opium on his legs on the afternoon of April 24th while walking near the Roosevelt Wharf and Taiwan Road intersection.

Yesterday afternoon, they were transferred to the First Criminal Division of the First Special Court and prosecuted for drug trafficking and use. Judge Xiao presided over the hearing and questioned each individual, sentencing them to various punishments as a warning.

### Zhang Shende Enthusiastically Helps Those in Need

Given the difficult times and the suffering of his compatriots, he did not want to waste valuable funds on a personal celebration. Instead, he donated 900 yuan in national currency to the Refugee Association. The association has received and distributed the funds and expressed its gratitude to the refugees.

### Social Miscellany

Zhou Jishan (26 years old) of Shaoxing snuck into the Lao Baofeng Jewelry Store at 1177 Xiaoshadu Road at 7:30 PM the day before yesterday. He asked clerk Yao Lianqing to show him two new-style rings under the pretense of exchanging them for purchase. Seizing the opportunity, he snatched them and fled. Clerk Yao apprehended him and handed him over to Chinese Constable No. 2572, who transferred him to the First Special Court. After questioning, he was sentenced to four months in prison as a warning.

Qian Renfu (31 years old, resident of 51 Lanxin Lane, Rue Bel), a local, does not engage in legitimate business. He has been punished for theft and drug trafficking nine times. Showing no remorse, he stole a wallet from Mr. Liu Daoyin, a passenger from Nanjing, on the No. 21 bus at the intersection of Rue Gros and Rue Auguste Viller at approximately 11:00 AM the day before yesterday. Mr. Liu discovered the theft and notified the driver to stop the bus. Chinese constables arrived and found the stolen wallet in Qian's pocket. He was taken to the police station and transferred to the Special Second Court yesterday, which announced a rescheduled hearing.

Between 2:00 AM and 4:00 PM the day before yesterday, the Huishan Police Station, based on informant reports, successively apprehended theft suspects Shi Changxiang, Li Kangyou, and ten others at 18 Lane 864 Zhoujiazui Road and 59 Siwen Lane, Huade Road.

The police officer in charge of the area learned of the incident and reported it to the police station, who arrested Lin Aru. Judge Meng of the First Special Court reviewed the situation yesterday morning and postponed the case until the victim's injuries had healed.

### Yan Kanghou's "Random Notes on Visual Education"

Dr. Yan Kanghou, a specialist in visual education, was one of the first people in China to study this topic at Columbia University in the United States. Though Mr. Gao studied this topic earlier, he quit before graduating to seek his fortune. Thus, the two men were the only two people to study this topic in the early days. After working in Beijing and Tianjin, Mr. Yan went overseas in 1918 to study on his own dime. After returning to China, he began to put his skills to work in Shanghai, and for a long time was well-regarded by the academic community. Now, his first location, the Cishu Building, is becoming too small. Thus, he has opened Juemin Optical Company at 774 Nanjing Road, next to the Zhabei Police Station, to help people correct misaligned eyes, adjust poor eyesight habits, and other abnormalities. He does not charge for standard eye exams and fittings, so that he can share his services. He has recently compiled a monthly periodical titled "Random Notes on Visual Education" that speaks specifically to scientific common sense about visual education. The first issue has already been published, and he is gifting it to all communities.

### Guo Shaowen's Funeral Today

Guo Shaowen, the head of the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall in the French Concession, took over the position in the early winter of 1924 and has been making every effort to organize charitable acts for the Hall. During the August 13th Incident, he also made great efforts to support burial work and was even more enthusiastic. He also supervised and led the staff to record detailed information on unclaimed corpses received by the Hall's attached autopsy center, so that the corpse's family would later be able to come and claim it. His drive and spirit were deeply admired by all communities. He unfortunately died suddenly of hemoptysis on February 23 of this year, lasting only two days. The Hall’s fellow members were filled with regret. His descendants, Jing Su, Li Xun, and Shi Quan, are holding a funeral ceremony today at the Jingtu Zen Temple on Guling Road, with a memorial tablet. It is expected that there will be a lively scene of white horses and plain carriages at that time.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Announcement: Ban on the Redemption of Pledged Items; Prohibition of Business Transactions Involving Pawn Tickets; All Said Shops Have Closed

Since some merchants in this city began to engage in the business of buying pawn tickets, the transaction of buying and selling pawn tickets has developed and nearly become a legitimate business. These shops that redeem pawned items on behalf of customers are lined up next to each other on busy streets, and they open one after another. However, there are many abuses in this business, and it has become a new way for thieves to sell stolen goods. The French Concession Police Department has already detained and fined some of these shops earlier this month, (however, those with larger scales that display jewelry, gold, and silver in a way that makes them seem like silver shops are still in existence). The Shanghai Municipal Council is also aware of this situation and, after detailed investigation, has decided to ban this practice and announced it yesterday: "In order to announce this matter, it is hereby announced that starting from the date of publication of this announcement, this Bureau prohibits the purchase and sale of pawn tickets or conducting business in the form of pawn tickets. Violators will be investigated and prosecuted according to law. This announcement is hereby issued to inform everyone." After receiving the order, most shops that redeem pledged items for their customers have already closed in compliance with the order.

### Lawyer Wu Huatai Suggests Improving Firefighting Equipment

To whom it may concern, Huatai believes that recent incidents of deaths caused by fires, which has occurred repeatedly, shows that there seems to be a lack of firefighting equipment in Shanghai. He recalls that in February 1934, he had suggested that all fire brigades should be equipped with safety nets, and sent a letter to a pictorial magazine, which was published in their pages. Given the special environment in Shanghai, where there are fewer houses and more people, and one house is often shared by four or five or even seven or eight families, the danger when there is a fire is unimaginable. In recent cases, such as the fire on North Shanxi Road on the 21st of last month, the fire on Hankou Road on the 23rd, and the fire on Ningxing Street on the 30th, there were incidents of burns and deaths. Huatai was deeply saddened after reading about these cases, so he raises this issue again, reiterating his previous request. He sent a letter to the fire brigades of both the British and French concessions with the following words: "When it comes to the maintenance of safety and perfect equipment in Shanghai, the fire brigade is unparalleled. They arrive immediately after receiving the report and extinguish the fire in an instant. Their services are so good that they are on par with those of countries in the East and West. However, in recent years, new buildings in Shanghai have been trending towards increasing height. For example, residential buildings have four or five floors, and there are also many skyscrapers with more than ten floors, which adds more difficulties to firefighting. If a fire occurs on the lower floors, it is often difficult for those on the top floor to escape. Although there is equipment such as rescue ladders, in places with large crowds and in times of panic, everyone wants to be the first to escape, and may not be able to maintain order and climb the ladder in order. In the case of skyscrapers with more than ten floors, long ladders may not be able to reach them. In February 1934, Huatai suggested that your association and others should be equipped with safety nets (the nets are made of extremely strong ropes, tied into a grid of five or six feet in length and width, with very sparse holes), so that when the ladder cannot reach high floors, this net can be used, with the four corners pulled open, so that those who cannot escape can jump down from a high place and ensure their safety. It was later heard that the fire brigades had adopted this measure, but after researching the pros and cons, they felt that it was not perfect. The rope used to construct the net, over time, may be subject to weakness, which can cause ruptures if there is excessive weight on the rope. Because of this, the material was changed to tarpaulin, also known as jumping cloth. Now, these are widely equipped, and one’s own private feelings express great appreciation. Now, these deaths caused by fires should be able to be avoided. However, news stories in the past few days has revealed that, in fact, in the last week alone, deaths have occurred in these three recent fires due to falling from heights: North Shanxi Road, Hankou Road, and Ningxing Street. Truly, this is unbearable. We are a major port of trade. The people are crowded and commerce is flourishing. This rescue net, or this jumping cloth, are trivial and easy to equip. The cost is minimal, but the benefits are truly great. I have once again sent a letter to express these unsolicited thoughts, and still hope that they will be adopted. If there is this type of equipment already, I hope that it will be put to extensive use. Several million citizens will be grateful." I believe that your publication is a mouthpiece for the citizens and will definitely support this, and will make a sympathetic advocacy to promote its realization. If any of this is warranted, I still wish to be educated. I send this to the Shen Bao newspaper's Zhongbi, Writer, Attorney Wu Huatai on May 4th with respect.

### Weather Report

The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday: Sunny around Shandong, wind direction undefined, here and the East Sea from cloudy to overcast, fog, northerly to fruit wind. Yesterday afternoon before 3:00 PM, the local temperature in the last 24 hours was a maximum of 63.0 and a minimum of 47.5. On the same day last year, the maximum was 87.3 and the minimum was 56.3.

### Letters to the Editor

To the esteemed Editor, yesterday afternoon, a man around 40 years old, speaking with a Northern accent and calling himself Chen Junda, came to my residence. Under the pretext of a visit, he asked for one of my business cards (the card has the Shen Bao magazine's Ji Zhizhong's name and phone number printed on it). At the time, only my child was at home. Because the visitor was able to say my name and occupation, I did not suspect anything and gave him a business card after asking him to leave a note. However, I did not know this person, and I do not know what the note he left means. Furthermore, he did not ask where I was, and actually barged into the second floor. I heard that similar events occurred at Mr. Cai's residence and Ms. He's residence in the neighborhood at the same time. This behavior seems to be fraudulent beyond a doubt. I will not be responsible for any loans borrowed, items fraudulently taken, or anything else done using the stolen business cards. I humbly request that you publish this letter in the "Letters to the Editor" column to prevent others from being deceived. With best regards, Ji Zhizhong on May 4th.

To whom it may concern, I am writing to you about the news about this city that was published on the 4th, which had a news story about the manager of the Tiancheng Money Exchange being kidnapped at home yesterday. Near the end, you wrote "It has been heard that the owner of this shop was Mr. Lu Gengsheng, who was shot in the last month and who has died.". This is quite a surprise. According to the late brother Lu Gengsheng, he had monetary exchanges with the Tiancheng Money Exchange on a day-to-day basis and was not a stakeholder for the shop. We were afraid that there would be outside misunderstandings, and therefore are respectfully writing this letter to request that this newspaper correct this matter. We are grateful for this. We are sending this to the Shanghai press news department for inspection with respect. Lu Gengdi, May 4th.

### Financial Affairs: The Foreign Exchange Situation Remains Uncertain; Chinese Merchants Initially Sold Heavily Then Returned to a Neutral Position

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no change in HSBC's listed rates. The unofficial market for British and American currencies initially tightened, then retreated during the day, ultimately closing flat. The market experienced significant stimulation, and the turmoil has yet to subside. Looking at the morning's trading, the movements were truly astonishing, driven by frenzied speculation and a large number of "扒戶" (scalpers), leading to high demand and a sharp price contraction. British gold broke all previous records, falling to only 3.0625 taels. Later, speculators took profits, and there were more sellers than buyers in the market, resulting in a particularly firm market sentiment. The loosest price for British gold was 3.15625 taels, and US dollars could be settled at 4.625 yuan. However, the final results were similar to yesterday's close, with British gold at 3.125 taels and US dollars at 4.5 yuan. Futures prices also showed little difference. Because new price levels have not yet been established, people remain uncertain, and the market feels erratic.

Closing Market Offers No Clear Gains or Losses

In the morning, London's telegraph indicated that large amounts of currency had fallen by 4.375, and distant futures had dropped by 3.75. New York silver prices remained flat, London raw gold was stagnant, the British exchange rate against the US dollar was unchanged, against Shanghai it was slightly higher by 0.0625, against France it remained unchanged, the US dollar against the British pound shrank by 0.75, against Shanghai it fell by 0.3 yuan, and against France it fell by 0.5%. The central bank's listed rates for various currencies remained the same. Banks opened in the morning with spot selling prices of 3.125 taels for British gold and 4.4375 yuan for US dollars, which was flat for British gold and down 0.0625 for US dollars compared to the previous day's close, due to the continued decline in exchange rates. At the same time, futures opened with no clear gains or losses. Soon after, Chinese merchants and speculators came to "扒結" (scrape together), and the market fluctuated, again showing signs of "有行無市" (having offers but no buyers). It was reported that foreign banks had sold 2.9375 taels of British gold for May delivery to speculators, and the softest spot price was 3.0625 taels, marking an unprecedented record. HSBC's listed rates were announced as unchanged, and the silver equalization tax was reduced by 2 yuan. After this, speculators suddenly sold off in large quantities, resulting in a surplus of positions and a subsequent relaxation of prices. It is estimated that foreign banks absorbed 4.4375 yuan for US dollars for May delivery and 3.0625 taels for British gold for May delivery from speculators. Moreover, foreign banks had previously offered spot US dollars as high as 4.625 yuan, and the cheapest spot British gold was 3.15625 taels. As of noon, the situation remained stable. American banks had sold spot US dollars to foreign firms at 4.5625 yuan. Ultimately, British gold closed at 3.125 taels and US dollars at 4.5 yuan. This month's British gold was 3 taels, and US dollars were 4.3125 yuan. Both futures and spot prices were the same as yesterday's close. The market was closed in the afternoon due to Saturday.

Hong Kong Shanghai Exchange Rate Continues to Rise

Hong Kong, 4th (Saturday) dispatch: The exchange market opened flat this morning. There was no change in British exchange rates for spot and futures, or in spot US dollars.

The Japanese exchange rate for spot goods tightened by 0.5 yuan to 91.5 yuan. At 10:10 AM, the Shanghai exchange rate for spot goods fell back by 7 yuan to 457 yuan.

At 11:30 AM, the chaos continued, and there was no change in any of the exchange rates. The market was closed in the afternoon due to Saturday.

Tianjin US Dollars at Exactly Four Yuan

The Shanghai exchange rate for spot goods fell by 4.5 yuan to 113.5 yuan. The unofficial price of "聯鈔" (United Notes) rose by 1.5 yuan to 103.5 yuan.

### Foreign Currencies Rise Then Turn Flat

Yesterday's market situation for currencies of various countries saw British and American gold pounds initially continue their wild fluctuations. Due to the continuous rise and subsequent fall of cash, those who profited made some sales, causing market prices to decline immediately. As a result, compared to the previous day, they each rose by one yuan. Demand for British gold notes did not decrease, and market prices continued to rise. US dollar notes initially traded at 21.78 yuan, and then rose to 23.5 yuan, an unprecedented high price. However, after the high price, it caused a general profit-taking sell-off, and the final price was 21.5 yuan, with no difference compared to yesterday. Hong Kong notes continued to closely follow the sharp rise in the Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange rate. Demand for French franc notes remained strong, and market prices remained firm. The rising trend of Canadian notes did not diminish. In addition, the supply and demand for notes from New Holland, Annam, Robi, and the Philippines were balanced, and market prices remained stable. Demand for Japanese gold notes was still strong, and the evening market was 1.295 yuan. There were slightly more inquiries for Korean currency, and the evening market was 0.99 yuan.

### Discount Rate Returns to Thirty; Call Loan Rate Remains at Two Fen

Yesterday's discount rate for drafts and bills of exchange rose again. Initially, the morning discount rate was 180 yuan per thousand for buying in and 220 yuan for selling out. Later, it gradually lowered to around 160 yuan, 170 yuan at noon, and rose again to around 110 yuan in the afternoon, a 30 yuan increase compared to the previous day. The interest rate on interbank loans from the Money Trade Association was approximately 0.25 yuan for both the morning and noon markets.

### British and Indian Silver Prices Stable

London, 3rd dispatch: The silver market saw slightly more buying, but lacked sustained momentum, with few transactions. The market was stable, and official prices remained flat in the after-market. New York Silver dispatch: US silver prices remained flat. Bombay Silver dispatch: The market was calm, with futures and spot prices each down a small amount. 50 contracts were traded.

### The Gold Market Remains Difficult to Stabilize; Fluctuating Around the 7,000 Yuan Mark, with Ups and Downs of 450 Yuan

Yesterday's spot cash market situation initially rose and then fell, with fluctuations closely following the foreign exchange market. However, a strong investor sentiment was also a major factor. In the early morning, it was heard that the foreign exchange market was entering an extremely tight state, and buying immediately surged. The opening price was 7,200 yuan, fluctuating by 300 yuan. A certain bank, acting on behalf of a foreign firm in the money exchange industry, was the most active in searching for purchases. However, soon after, the "證券帮" (securities gang) of Yu Hao poured out supply, sharply pressing the price down to 6,750 yuan. Subsequently, the money exchange industry re-engaged in absorption, returning above the 7,000 yuan mark, reaching 7,100 yuan. However, due to the Saturday effect, retail investors crowded to close out positions, falling again to 6,850 yuan. Ultimately, the money exchange industry maintained its efforts and closed at 6,910 yuan, a slight increase of 10 yuan compared to the previous day. In the afternoon, sentiment outside the market was still good, with many buyers at the noon closing price, but there was a lack of suppliers, resulting in no trading. The volume traded was approximately 3,000 taels. Silver jewelry prices initially rose and then fell, ultimately down slightly by 10 yuan. Customs gold remained flat.

Cash Again Rises By Ten Yuan

Since the morning, each bar (ten taels), initially reported a decline in the exchange rate, and the US dollar became tight, but investor sentiment remained strong. A certain money exchange firm was eager for demand and called out for purchases first, causing the opening price to jump by 300 yuan, with Jin Hao and others buying dozens of taels at a price of 7,200 yuan. At the same time, trades also opened at 7,200 yuan. Unexpectedly, a certain gold firm, due to some negative rumors in the market, urgently sold off, and the quantity was quite large. In addition, the securities gang followed up with a sharp influx, and the exchange rate relaxed, significantly reducing the number of buyers, and the price immediately plummeted by 450 yuan. Jin Hao sold 10 taels to the money exchange firm, retreating to 6,750 yuan. However, at that time, the buying intentions of the money exchange firm resurfaced, and another securities gang followed up, while the selling positions of the gold firms gradually decreased, and the price soared again by 350 yuan, returning above the 7,000 yuan mark. The money exchange firm bought 30 taels from Jin Hao at a price of 7,100 yuan. Shortly after, the exchange rate became flat, and a certain money exchange firm had stopped purchasing. The silver firm gang took advantage of the high price to sell forcefully, and scattered investors and gold firms also sold off one after another, returning again to the 7,000 yuan mark. Jin Hao sold 50 taels to the money exchange firm at a price of 6,850 yuan. Near the close, the money exchange firm slightly pulled in, raising the price by 60 yuan. The money exchange firm traded 20 taels at 6,910 yuan, setting the noon closing price. As a result, compared to the previous day, the cash price rose by ten yuan. The fluctuations were 450 yuan for half a day. The selling price of the cash firm's own brand gold was ten yuan higher than that of cash, and the purchasing price was reduced by 30 yuan. The current standard gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there were few trades.

Fine Silver Also Hangs at One Yuan Higher

The initial exchange rate for silver jewelry was 710 yuan for Datongxing, and then at 9:30 AM, it was raised by 20 yuan, and returned to 20 yuan lower not ten minutes later. At 9:55 AM, it continued to be lowered by 10 yuan, and at 10:00 AM, it returned to 10 yuan higher. At noon, it was again 10 yuan lower. There were also changes after this, and the result was 10 yuan lower. It is estimated that Datongxing changed to 700 yuan, and the new firm had the same price as above. The purchasing price was reduced by about 30 to 40 yuan. The exchange rate for Datongxing's fine silver was raised by one yuan, and it is estimated that it was changed to 6 yuan.

### Securities: Public Bonds Return to Weakness

Yesterday's market for securities in the unofficial market was weak again. Because there were fewer transactions, there were not many waves. The market was firm initially due to covering short positions, and then fell due to retail investors closing long positions. Rumors continued to strike the market, indicating the emptiness of investor sentiment. As a result, there were many bank withdrawals, causing unnecessary commotion. Yesterday, Qiwu, Tongsheng, Lianhe, and Xinfu bought in, all to cover short positions. Yuankang, Lianyi, Shengyi, Daren, and Chang were partly selling long positions and partly the continued outflow of spot goods. Therefore, market prices tended to weaken. In the afternoon, Yitai and Shengyi, as well as retail investors, covered short positions, and Shunkang and Yongfeng sold, and market prices slightly rebounded. On the surface, it was still a hovering situation, but future changes are bound to be astonishing and must be guarded against. Yesterday's market price was slightly lower, ranging from 0.15 to 0.3 yuan. The turnover was approximately 600,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:

Stock Transactions: 20 shares of Commercial Press stock were traded at a price of 79 yuan.

London, 3rd (Friday) dispatch: Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign debt remained stable. There were no changes in the prices of various bonds.

London, 3rd (Friday) dispatch: Today's listed prices for British Far East company stocks saw HSBC shares continue to fall by 0.5 pounds, to a price of 91.5 pounds. The rest were unchanged.

### Two Foreign Stocks Pay Dividends

The 25th annual shareholders' meeting of the Shellam Barber Company Limited, managed by the manager of the British Huitong Foreign Firm, will be held in Shanghai on May 17. The 1939 dividend is 0.25 yuan per share.

The board of directors of the local Zhonghe Industrial Co., Ltd. recently decided to withdraw a portion of the surplus from the sale of a certain property of the company to distribute a special dividend of 2 yuan per share for 1939, which will be paid from May 9.

### Dried and Preserved Goods: Large Slices of Dried Longan Return to Rising Prices

A few days ago, a small quantity of large slices of sun-dried longan was offered by a certain company, but because the quality was relatively soft, the price fell by 6 yuan. Now, the company has slightly more arriving, and the goods are better and the color is also red. They were immediately sold, and the price rose by 6 yuan.

### Grains: Foreign Rice Makes a Big Football Business - Fluctuating by as Much as Three to Four Yuan in a Single Day

Yesterday, the rice market was very volatile and unpredictable. Continuing the momentum from the previous day, sentiment was strong and rising, and it turned into a situation where there was no movement, but once there was movement, the shouting was frenzied. In an instant, trading was booming, and the prices of various types of rice flew up by more than two yuan, especially 小絞 (small-grained rice), which was the most active. It even broke the high point during the Lunar New Year and opened at 50 yuan. Later, when it was heard that the gold price had broken through the 7,000 yuan mark, the general floating and retail investors became even more excited, stirred up trouble, and regardless of the quality of the goods, they were only afraid of not getting their hands on it, and pulled it in recklessly, using their old tricks of manipulation, creating an unprecedented "塔尖" (peak). For example, No. 1 Saigon opened at 54 yuan, and small-grained rice at 52 yuan, a huge increase of three to four yuan compared to the closing price the previous afternoon. Fortunately, the market hovered after that and did not continue to rise. And because the gold price fell back, sentiment was quite frustrated, and those who profited sold back one after another, and the high price was difficult to maintain, and the price went down step by step. No. 1 Saigon fell to 52.5 yuan, and small-grained rice fell to 49.5 yuan. Until the close of the market, it could not rise again. As a result, it increased by half a yuan compared to the closing price yesterday, and compared to the peak price the previous morning, it was only half a yuan better. The whole market was tight and then weak, rising and falling one after another, reaching three yuan. It can be seen that the changes in the rice market are drastic. It was found that this wave of price increases only lasted for a few days, and suddenly rose by ten yuan. The power of one price increase was even greater than slaughter.

When domestic rice prices were high, foreign rice was also in the midst of a violent storm. However, because it was not affected by the exchange rate, its momentum was not as strong as that of foreign rice. It was only mutually influential and raised together. It is rumored that in the off-market trade, the price of thick and thin粳 (Japonica) of the first grade, although the destination was quite chestnut-like, the selling price only fluctuated by more than one yuan. Special 淸粳 (clear Japonica) from Wuxi was 51-52 yuan,粉粳 (powdery Japonica) was 50 yuan, 常崑粳 (Chang Kun Japonica) was 51 yuan, and second-grade宿熱 (stale and hot) was 48-49 yuan.特薄 (Extra thin)稻 (paddy) from Qingsi was around 51 yuan,大市 (the general market) was 50 yuan, 49 yuan.南港 (Nangang) early and late稻 (paddy) was high-priced at 49 yuan, and second-grade was 47-48 yuan. Although glutinous rice prices are cheap, the destination is too small, so it is not as tight as other goods, so the price is not easy to raise sharply, only increasing by half a yuan. 开 (Kai)特 (Te) from Liyang and Jintan was 44.5 yuan, 44 yuan,大市 (the general market) was 42-42 yuan, and 常 (Chang)货 (goods) from Dan were 高 (Gao) since 42-43 yuan, and the second-grade 潮軟 (damp and soft) ones were still only around 40 yuan. Yesterday, it was heard that 1,700-1,800 bags of粳 (Japonica) and glutinous rice were shipped out of the inland river barges and the Hongkou district.

Foreign rice is in speculation and in the heat, and the market has lost its normal state. There are very few actual sales. The market is completely a football business. As soon as they hear that the gold exchange rate continues to contract, they all rush to buy in. If there is news of a gold drop, then they compete to sell off. In the early market, continuing the price increase from the previous day, buying was extremely strong. The price of Chenxi 1 was 54 yuan. Small-grained rice was up to 52 yuan. Other rices were raised consistently, and rose two yuan higher than the closing price the night before. Compared to the morning closing price, there was a difference of three or four yuan. However, hearing the rumors that the exchange rate was returning to growth, the market price immediately fell by one or two yuan as they competed to sell off. The afternoon slightly rebounded, and the result was not much different from the previous day's closing price. Only the five-month No. 2 Saigon which was going to be brought back rose. The opening price in the early market was as high as 61 yuan, an increase of 1.5 yuan compared to the night before. Subsequently, the price was lowered gradually as floating investors cut their long positions, and the lowest price in the afternoon was 58.7 yuan, and the closing price rebounded slightly to 59.1 yuan, still down 0.4 to 0.5 yuan compared to the night before. Both buying and selling were active. The futures volume was 600-700 tons, and the spot rice was nearly 10,000 bags, still mainly floating investors.

### Flour Continues to Increase By Two Fen; The Rising Trend of Inland Flour is Even Stronger

Yesterday, the flour market saw factory prices continue to increase by two fen, changing to 14 yuan in cash. Because the gold market soared again and rice prices rose, the cost of each factory had to be above 15 yuan. For the wholesale price on this street, the nature of maintenance is still maintained. Old car brand flour from backflowed goods was locked up by hoarding households and had to be sold at 14.45 yuan, but there were no significant transactions. Inland flour has recently been happily taken by this street, and the rising trend is even stronger. For example, the Double Lion brand reached 14.3 yuan, and the Shan Lu brand reached 14.25 yuan. There were 4,000-5,000 bags traded, all handled by this street. The amount of zero-batch purchased from the factory by this street was approximately 7,000 bags.

### Oil Market: Soybean Oil Actual Sales Still Lacking

The situation in the oil market still cannot escape the environmental constraints, causing investor sentiment to remain high. Trading in the market is unusually lively, but actual sales only account for a quarter, and the pace of price increases is still narrow. As a result, soybean oil has few differences, but peanut oil is slightly tighter by one or two yuan. Today, 650 cans of raw oil were shipped to Hong Kong.

The price of soybeans rose by 0.4 to 0.5 yuan yesterday, but its foundation is not solid. It seems that if the external storm on Monday is not large, investor sentiment will inevitably waver, and it is feared that the overall situation will be difficult to maintain. Today, 1,630 bags of soybeans will be shipped to Hong Kong.

### Sugar Market: The Rising Trend of Sugar Prices is Still Strong

Yesterday, in the sugar market, because the foreign exchange rate continued to be tight, the association's benchmark price rose again. The spot price of Er Si coarse white from Waizhan (Foreign Warehouse) with arrival on March 18 was 76 yuan, and the price with arrival on April 28 was 76.5 yuan, an increase of about 3 yuan. The price of Taigu Che Bai B Mark was 86 yuan, an increase of 1-2 yuan. H Che Chi (H Car Red) was 61.5 to 63 yuan, an increase of 3 yuan. The price of domestic sugar Guoxiang Chi was 58 yuan, an increase of 5 yuan. The price of Hainan Chi was 55 to 56 yuan, a sharp increase of more than 10 yuan. The price of Diaoqing 4 was 65 yuan, but there were no transactions.

### Cotton Yarn: Although Actual Sales are Stagnant, Yarn Prices Still Rise; Speculation Focuses on Double Horse as a Tool; Higher Than Similar Yarns by 200 Yuan

The yarn market remains extremely chaotic. General speculators are using the opportunities of the foreign exchange rate, expanding and contracting from time to time, still tending to drag in. However, as it continues to rise, actual sales are largely stagnant. Therefore, the target of twenty-count Double Horse is used as a tool, and the rising power is particularly strong. As a result, the price of twenty-count cotton yarn of the same type is 120 to 200 yuan lower than Double Horse. It is conceivable that consumers are weak.

The morning opening of spot yarn was due to the contraction of the US dollar in the afternoon of the previous day, the popularity was enthusiastic, and the shouts were chaotic like hemp. The situation was tight and loose. The spot price of 20-count Double Horse jumped 100 yuan, to 1,760 yuan. The price of May futures was 1,800 yuan, trading at 1,815 yuan. As soon as the US dollar opened, and then turned stable, the enthusiasm suddenly slackened, and the spot price fell to 1,708 yuan. After the close, it went back up ten yuan. It was found that the trading statistics for half a day were 1,520 packages. Today, 205 pieces of yarn are shipped to Yagang. The amount of each gang's purchase is listed as follows:

Trading firms 500 Hong Kong 420

Inland 200

Statistics 1,520

### Tight Credit; The Cotton Market Stagnates

This cotton transaction is exceptionally 清澹 (light and delicate), but the momentum is still firm. As for the factory side, there is very little vitality, and not a single package is handled. The buying and selling between counterparts is also not as lively as it used to be. In fact, it is due to the tight credit. The following is a record of the current cotton transactions:

Huocao Package 32.00 Traded between counterparts 500 packages

Olmra 295.00 Traded between counterparts 100 pieces

Xinte 13.00 Traded between counterparts 100 pieces

Pingguoer 35.00 Traded between counterparts 200 pieces

Another message: The market price of foreign cotton, the New York cotton market, the market situation is quite quiet, and the later father, due to the short-selling in the south and the selling by overseas merchants, the closing price fell five or six pounds compared to the previous day. Indian cotton market, due to the impact of the sharp contraction in the Shanghai exchange rate, all parties are watching. Yesterday, including the forecast, increased by one Robi, Egypt increased by eight or nine pounds.

The transaction of foreign cotton in Shanghai has been quieter recently, but all parties continue to see high cotton prices. However, because credit is extremely tight, transactions are scarce. However, according to reliable sources, the Japanese have little cotton in stock and will purchase spot goods within days.

### Piece Goods: The Higher the Cloth Price, the More Stagnant the Destination; Longtou Fine Cloth Single, Higher Than Spot by Five Yuan

Cloth prices continue to see increase, because hoarding households inside and outside the industry are still rich with buying appetite, the factory price has been raised, so searching for hand goods is quite enthusiastic, but actual sales run counter to this, and are increasingly declining. The market is extremely chaotic. For cloth of the same quality, the price difference is as high as five or six yuan per piece due to the relationship between the brand's maturity. This is because mature brands meet the needs of speculators. Even more, the Longtou fine cloth factory's warehouse list goods must be more expensive than each spot goods by four or five yuan, which is really a strange phenomenon. The turnover for the whole day was more than 800 pieces bought and sold by the trade association. White goods sold out rose 0.25 to 1 yuan, colored cloth rose 1 to 2 yuan, and bleached cloth and other light-colored goods were scarce. Today, 130 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong.

Eastern cloth rose in the morning and fell at noon, and fine cloth fell 0.8 to 0.9 yuan per piece. When the market opened in the morning, the market was particularly strong. The highest price for the Longtou spot single once reached around 46 yuan. Before long, it fell to the noon closing price of 44.5 yuan. In the afternoon, because there were many rumors and news of restrictions on withdrawals in the financial industry, investor sentiment was fearful, and credit became tight, and the market transaction turned to clear. Fine cloth once reached 43.5 yuan. By the time of the closing, it had risen again. The Longtou fine cloth was 44 yuan. This month's cloth was 46.5 yuan. The current price of Four Gentlemen twill is 2.56 yuan per yard.

### Wanli Is Selling Well

The market for Wanli wool crepe was tight yesterday, and the selling price was high both officially and unofficially. Last year, Western-style clothing was popular, and sales are even more popular this summer. The outlet for Yuanchang, Huanghui, and white is active. It has been found that most of the goods arriving at the foreign firm have been sold out. According to a recent investigation report, the number of Wanli wool crepe of Xihuo Changtai, Meichen, Zhaoji, Xiankang, Haoshi, and Japanese goods transferred from Hong Kong to Shanghai is less than fifty pieces in the entire city, which makes investor sentiment firm and the market price is generally expected to rise again. On the day the foreign exchange rate changed drastically, there was an additional two yuan to make more profits. Yesterday, Western wool Wanli wool crepe was sold for 23.5 yuan per yard in general, the price for Eastern goods was 19.5 yuan, and the secondary brand was 16 yuan. A few cents must be added to the selling price of pure white. Door shops increase the price for zero cuts by more than one yuan.

### Silk and Tea: Tin Sericulture Costs Are Not Low

Wuxi is a sericulture area. Last year, the silkworms sold at an unprecedented high price, and interest in sericulture was quite high. Now that the silkworm season has arrived, the total silkworm breeding volume is 30% more than last year. A total of 280,000 to 300,000 silkworm machines were issued from various fields. Silkworm bodies have been developing rapidly in recent days. The earliest hatched silkworms are already five days old, and the latest hatched silkworms are one or two days old. However, the estimated quantity of leaves is expected to be in short supply in the future, so prices are gradually rising. The current price is 10 to 12 yuan per load. According to sericulture people, at the current silk price, each load costs about 4,000 yuan. Silkworm farmers consume about four loads of mulberry leaves to raise one silkworm egg. The cocoon yield of each silkworm egg is about 30 catties. If the leaf price is 10 yuan per load, the cost of mulberry leaves is already 40 yuan. If fresh cocoons are sold at 200 yuan per load, then the cocoon production of each silkworm egg can earn 60 yuan. Subtracting the 40 yuan leaf price, plus the consumption of labor, silkworm eggs, and other items, there is still a small profit. If the cocoon price is less than 200 yuan, and the leaf price is higher than 10 yuan, if the silkworms die in the middle of the process, the silkworm farmers will lose money. (良)

### Metals Black Iron Billets Rise Abruptly

The metal market, affected by the sharp drop in exchange rates over the past three days, has become stagnant. Price quotations for various goods are also chaotic. Actual transactions are exceptionally slow, and market sentiment remains fearful. Fluctuations of several hundred yuan in a single day are common. For example, black iron billets were still quoted at 1,200 yuan in a quiet market, but yesterday's market price ranged from 1,400 to 1,500 yuan, without a clear standard. 200-pound U.S. Steel Company iron, which was sold for 190 yuan the day before, was quoted at 220 yuan yesterday. Tinplate has long exceeded 300 yuan, and new galvanized wire has reached the 150 yuan mark. Hunan pure antimony has reappeared at 6,000 yuan. U.S. narrow strip iron is also sold at 160 yuan, and zinc iron requires 200 yuan.

### Shanghai City Student Federation Established: Over 300 Representatives from Universities and Middle Schools Attended

(Daguang News Agency) The Shanghai City Student Federation held its inaugural meeting yesterday. Participants included 27 universities and 63 middle schools, with a total of over 300 representatives. Representatives from relevant authorities and various sectors also attended to provide guidance. On the same day, the articles of association and declaration of establishment were approved, along with several important resolutions. Three telegrams were also sent: one to pay respects to President Chiang, one to express condolences to the soldiers at the front, and one to denounce the puppet organization. The atmosphere at the meeting was extremely enthusiastic. It is expected that the federation will achieve much in its future work. Key points from the original telegrams are excerpted below:

Telegram to Pay Respects to President Chiang: The general idea is that since the outbreak of the war of resistance, it has been three years. Under your leadership, the military and civilians across the country are united in spirit. Unexpectedly, at this time when the war has reached a stalemate and victory is in sight, a puppet government has been established. The young students of this city, living on an isolated island, have their hearts set on the motherland and vow to deal with the Japanese and puppets to the end with the greatest determination. We will never forget this unwavering resolve. As you hold the central authority and work for the country, we look up to your virtuous achievements with admiration and send our best wishes for the completion of your great mission and for your health and well-being.

Telegram of Condolences to the Soldiers at the Front: Roughly says, the Military Affairs Commission forwards to the meritorious soldiers at the front in various regions. Border alarm signals sound, and the vast land of China is painfully ravaged. Fortunately, our leader's command is resolute, and the soldiers at the front are vying to serve. Missiles fly like lightning, blood fills the trenches, they rise again after being stabbed, and enemies are annihilated like hair. Now the Japanese are trapped and deeply mired. The final victory is certain. It is hoped that they will continue to strive with sincerity to achieve complete success. The federation leads all students and vows to be a rear support, to eliminate the great enemy, and to restore our homeland. This telegram is sent to express our condolences, and we respectfully hope for your understanding.

Telegram to Denounce the Puppet Organization: The general idea is that this telegram is addressed to Chairman Lin of the National Government, Chairman Chiang of the Military Affairs Commission, the presidents of the various branches of the National Political Council, the directors of the various campaign headquarters, the ministers of the various ministries and commissions, the commanders-in-chief of the various war zones, the party headquarters and provincial governments of the various provinces, various legal entities, newspaper offices, and all compatriots across the country. The young students of this city firmly believe that without destroying power, there is no justice, and without eliminating violence, there is no peace. Therefore, we have organized a student federation and vow to lead all students in the city to gather under the leadership of the President, strictly adhere to our posts, and uphold national policies. The day the Japanese puppets collapse will be the day our homeland is restored. We respectfully send this telegram to denounce them and sincerely hope for your consideration.

### This Year's Middle School Graduation Examinations

Held in Fifteen Provinces Including Sichuan, Kang, Yunnan, Guizhou, etc.; Temporarily Postponed in Seven Provinces Including Jin, Sui, Lu, Hubei, Su, etc.

(Chongqing, 4th) The Ministry of Education has drafted and telegraphed to educational administrative agencies in various provinces and cities the measures for the 28th academic year (i.e., this year's summer) middle school student graduation examinations, to be held during the last week of June. These measures are largely the same as those stipulated for the 27th academic year. However, the number of provinces scheduled to hold examinations last year was eight, while this year it has increased to fifteen. The eight measures are as follows: (1) Middle school student graduation examinations will continue to be held in fifteen provinces including Sichuan, Kang, Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, Chahar, Hunan, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Fujian. In provinces with larger areas and transportation difficulties, the junior high school examinations may be conducted on a sampling basis. Senior high school examinations may be held in multiple locations, depending on the actual situation, to facilitate concentration. (2) Middle school graduation examinations in provinces such as Jin, Sui, Lu, Hubei, Guangdong, Su, and Anhui will not be held temporarily this year. However, the graduation examinations of schools currently in session shall be supervised by personnel dispatched by the provincial education departments. Procedures such as question setting, supervision, and sealing shall be strictly handled by the supervisory personnel in conjunction with the principals and teachers, in accordance with the various examination regulations. (3) Graduating students from national middle schools or schools that have relocated to various places due to the war should either participate in the graduation examinations of local schools of the same level or have their graduation examinations supervised by personnel dispatched by the local competent educational administrative authorities. (4) The subjects for this year's middle school student graduation examinations are stipulated as follows: Chinese language, foreign language, mathematics, science (physics and chemistry), and history and geography. However, junior high schools may, at the discretion of each province, exempt foreign languages. (5) The ranking of student graduates shall be provisionally determined by arranging the names of the students according to the overall average of their graduation scores in each subject. The method for calculating this overall average is the sum of the scores in the examination subjects and the scores in the non-examination subjects, divided by the sum of the number of examination subjects and non-examination subjects. (6) This year, only the list of schools participating in the examination needs to be published; there is no need to calculate school scores based on student performance. (7) Students with failing conduct or physical education scores shall not graduate. Each school should strictly assess the conduct and physical education scores of graduating students and should not allow them to participate in the examination simply because their academic performance is passing, regardless of whether their conduct and physical education scores are passing. (8) In provinces holding examinations, 10% of the total number of students who pass the senior and junior high school examinations with better scores will be allowed to be admitted to higher education without further examination. However, junior high school graduates who are exempted from English in the graduation examination should still be tested in English upon entering higher education.

### Message to All Students in Shanghai from the University and Middle School Student Federation

(Dahua News Agency) The University and Middle School Student Federation of this city issued a message to all students in Shanghai to commemorate the "May Fourth" Festival. It stated, "Time flies, and today is another Youth Day. On such a generous, passionate, tragic, and enthusiastic great festival that marks an era in Chinese history, no youth in the country, especially no Shanghai youth student who has been fighting and growing up in this extremely difficult and dangerous environment, does not recall the May Fourth Movement 21 years ago, when the students of Peking appeared with the distinct banner of overthrowing the traitors. Moreover, no one does not hate and despise the fact that, from the May Fourth Movement until now, our

Unfortunately, the country has continued to produce these traitors who sell out the country and the people and lose many sovereign rights and interests. However, we are determined to eradicate these traitors and recover everything that has been lost.

We certainly understand very well that the May Fourth Movement is the overall representative of the Chinese youth students leading the people to formally resist imperialism and attack feudal forces. Later, in order to commemorate the great significance of this student movement in Chinese history, it was renamed Youth Day. On the one hand, it can recall the countless youths who created this glorious and great achievement with blood and tears in this struggle. On the other hand, it also expresses encouragement for the future, hoping that the latter will continue the spirit of their predecessors and move forward. (To be continued)"

### Miniature Football Matches Yesterday: Jingxiang Lost to Xifusi; Youyou Won Against Zhenyou with a Late Comeback; French Business Association Suffered a Crushing Defeat to the French Army

Six matches were played yesterday in the Zhen Dan miniature football league, with many unexpected results and miracles in the three A group matches. The atmosphere on the field was exceptionally intense. The results are as follows:

A Group 1: French Army defeated French Business Association 3-2

A Group 1: Xifusi defeated Jingxiang 3-2

A Group 2: Youyou Association defeated Zhenyou 5-2

B Group 1: Iron Riders tied French Army 3-3

B Group 2: Zhen Dan A defeated Lion Voice 6-2

B Group 4: Jewish Association defeated Datong 8-0

Among them, the French Army's victory over the French Business Association was a major upset, while Xifusi's victory over Jingxiang with fewer players in the last half minute was purely lucky. Youyou, from a 0-3 deficit, scored five consecutive goals to turn the tables.

Youyou Turns Defeat into Victory

In the main match, Youyou and Zhenyou took the field. Zhenyou gathered all its famous players in hopes of a desperate fight. As the battle began, after three minutes, Carlo Liequ lightly passed, and Mao Honggui let the ball in from under his legs, and Youyou lost the first goal. At 21 minutes, Robert Stoff hit the target, but the goal was disallowed for offside. Carlo Liequ rushed up and hit the goalpost, and Zhenyou scored another goal. After three minutes, Robert Stoff quickly rushed in, and Mao Honggui missed again, and Zhenyou scored three goals in a row. Not until 30 minutes, Wu Binghao poked the empty goal to recover one goal, and lagged behind with a score of 1-3 in the first half. In the second half, Youyou adjusted its front line. At 12 minutes, Cao Qinfang's shot near the goal established a meritorious service (2-3). At 20 minutes, Zhenyou's defender Yu Zhendong fouled, and Cao Qinfang took the penalty kick and made the score 3-3. At 23 minutes, Qinfang's wonderful shot from 20 yards hit the crossbar and fell into the net, and Youyou exceeded with 4-1. Shortly after half a minute, Qinfang hooked from the baseline, and Youyou turned defeat into victory and defeated Zhenyou by a score of 5-3.

Youyou: Mao Honggui, Zhou Qilin, Wang Zhangbao, Hu Youcheng, Zhao Yongfang (off), Wu Binghao (on), Shen Jinda (on), Cao Qinfang (off), Yuan Kunda (on), Shen Jinda (off)

Zhenyou: Hu Shangfei, Yu Zhendong (off), Yesterday Zhao (off), Yesterday Dong (on), Zhang Shouzhong, Bu Bufu, Carlo Liequ, Robert Stoff, Yang Hongkui

Xifusi Frustrates Jingxiang

Xifusi has enough strength after all. Initially, it did not get the tricks of miniature football, and the kicks did not look satisfactory. Recently, it has gradually improved, and showed its brilliance yesterday. The battle situation was tense from beginning to end. Xifusi Tangxun opened the record first, and Zhou Benfang immediately recovered the lost ground. After each side scored one goal, Jiemo hit the corner of the net with great difficulty. Xifusi took the lead with 2-1 in the first half. Not long after changing sides, Yingbing's main player Deng Qing suffered a serious injury and retired. There was no one to substitute, and only six people played. After nearly 20 minutes of stalemate, Li William let go with a long shot, and the score was tied. At this point, the situation became more and more tense. When there was less than half a minute left in the game, the striker of the agent team, Sai Kousigan, succeeded with one kick. The ball went into the net and the whistle sounded. Jingxiang was finally defeated by 3-2.

Xifusi: Kai Lei Long, Kai Moer Maidangna, Mai Kou Sigan, Tang Muxun, Deng Ken, Jie Moer

Jingxiang: Wu Hanxiang, Huang Xiangsheng, Liu Guocai, Li William, Yu Guomu, Zhou Benfang, Chen Yaochun

### Jingwu Cup Ping Pong Round Robin Tournament: Lu Hanjun Defeats Xiao Zhuan

A Decisive Victory of Three Straight Sets Worthy of a Renowned Player, Tonight's Fourth Match

The third round robin match of the third Jingwu Cup Shanghai Individual Ping Pong Championship was held at the Jingwu Association's ball room the night before last at 7 PM. Unexpected results occurred continuously, greatly exciting the fans. In particular, the match between the rising star Chuan Gongfang and Lu Hanjun was the focus of the audience. After the two faced off, Chuan relied on his cunning style of looping shots and relentless attacks. Lu was also skilled in chopping, but in view of Zhang Ying's disastrous defeat with chopping yesterday, he changed his tactics and also returned with looping shots. Combined with his agile physique and extremely fast strokes, and the excellent landing point of his shots, Xiao Zhuan was unable to defend and was ineffective in counter-looping, being at a disadvantage all the way. As a result, Lu relied on his intelligence and experience to defeat his strong opponent in three straight sets, demonstrating the true qualities of the previous champion. Tonight (the 5th) at 7 PM, the fourth match will be held at the same location. Referees: Sui Shen, Chen Linsheng. To limit the number of spectators, tickets are priced at two jiao per person. The results of the night before last and tonight's schedule are recorded as follows:

The Night Before Last's Results: Lu Hanjun defeated Chuan Qifang 3-0, Deng Xiurong defeated Pan Rixi 3-1, Zhang Ying defeated Guo Jingren 3-1, Li Zongpei defeated Huang Zhijun 3-1.

Tonight's Schedule: (1) Ouyang Wei - Huang Zhijun, (2) Chuan Qifang - Deng Xiurong, (3) Li Zongpei - Guo Jingren, (4) Lu Hanjun - Pan Rixi.

### Japanese Miscellany

Kobe, a major metropolis in Japan, lies south of the vast sea. The locals build houses along the mountains. Gazing into the distance where the wild geese disappear into the sky, their houses are dimly visible. The mountain scenery is like a screen, this is the Kii Province of Japan. The flow of goods here relies entirely on Osaka. Although business is not as prosperous as Yokohama, the sails of ships come and go endlessly, making it a hub for trade in the East. The area is only a few miles in size, with a population of only tens of thousands. To the left is the Kusunoki Masashige Shrine. The temple is spacious and clean. In front of the temple is a wooden box. Worshippers toss a few coins into the box as an offering, bow before the deity, close their eyes, and clap their hands. It is said that the Japanese do not kneel and worship. A few steps to the west is the Hyogo area, similar in size to Kobe. The two places are connected by a stream several feet wide. High embankments are built on both sides of the stream, with ancient pine trees planted everywhere, providing a green canopy. Arriving here in the afternoon gives a sense of the ancient road at sunset. Not far east of the Kusunoki Shrine is the central train station, from which one can travel to Osaka and Kyoto. To the left of Kobe are two temples, one is the Suwa Mountain Fox Shrine, with tea houses, taverns, and hot spring baths located above and below the temple. From here, one can climb to the top and look far into the distance, with the landscape entering the painting, stretching endlessly. The other is the Ikuta Shrine. A few steps to the east leads to the main road to the Nunobiki Falls. The Nunobiki Mountain has two waterfalls, one is the "Male Waterfall," which is 24 zhang high, and the other is the "Female Waterfall," which is 18 zhang high.

### The Japan-China War Mired in Chinese Soil

— Song

Having Lost the Initiative, the Attacking Force Weakens Over Time

The Success of China's War of Attrition

One year, two years; the Japan-China war, almost three years in the making, remains mired in Chinese soil and unresolved. This is beyond the expectations of the Chinese, but beyond the expectations of the Japanese. Finally, due to the revelation of the facts, the Japanese warlords also understand that this is a long-term war. Former Prime Minister Abe, in a broadcast speech on November 25 last year, publicly admitted, "The completion of the China Incident and the removal of its aftermath will take at least ten years." The pessimistic attitude held by Japanese military and political leaders, on his part, is sufficient to prove that the attrition strategy adopted by the Chinese people has achieved

The Success of China's War of Attrition

great results, making it impossible for the Japanese to extricate themselves. As someone pointed out, China has reached the second stage of the long-term war of resistance. In this stage, Japan's military strength will gradually be consumed and weakened, losing its advantage.

In the first stage of the war, the Japanese army, with its superior quality and sophisticated weapons, repeatedly tried to annihilate the main force of the Chinese army. However, in the first stage of China's national liberation war, the situation was very different from the past. After the Japanese army captured Wuhan and Guangzhou, the Japanese had long declared that the future would be a political offensive, but Japan did not achieve this goal at all. The long-term war is still going on. With the arrival of the second phase of the war, Japan has lost its initiative in the military. China is able to smoothly carry out its purpose of destroying the morale of the Japanese frontline soldiers and increasing the anti-war sentiment of the Japanese domestic people. This in itself shows that China's long-term war of resistance strategy is successful.

Decline of the Japanese Offensive

Looking at the military actions in 1939, the strength of the Japanese offensive was far less than that, which is a proof of a trend of exhaustion of the Japanese offensive. None of the Japanese military actions in 1939 achieved her goal of eliminating the main force of the Chinese army. From another point of view, this is proof of the increased resistance of the Chinese army. Last year's large-scale Japanese military action was the attack on Nanchang, the purpose of which was to expand its power south of Hankou and reduce the threat of the Chinese army to its transportation lines (the Yangtze River waterway). In order to achieve this goal, the Japanese army advanced towards Nanchang, Yuezhou, and Changsha. If this plan were successful, this area could become a Japanese base, and the Japanese army could advance south along the Yuehan, and meet with the Japanese army in Guangdong, cutting off the connection between the coastal provinces of China, such as Fujian, Guangdong, and Zhejiang, and the inland. However, the Japanese army spent a lot of effort and only realized one goal, that is, the occupation of Nanchang. The Japanese army's advance towards Changsha was blocked by the Chinese army. In April, the Japanese army changed its target of advance again, wanting to advance from Hankou to the northwest, with Xinyang and Nanyang as its targets. At the same time, the Japanese army in Kaifeng also went south to respond. The Japanese decision to attack came unexpectedly, and suffered an unprecedented defeat since the Battle of Taierzhuang. They retreated two hundred kilometers and suffered tens of thousands of casualties. The large-scale offensive in northern Hubei came to an end.

In September last year, the Japanese army again attempted to invade northern Hunan to complete her plan to occupy Yuezhou and Changsha in mid-January. As a result, they were defeated outside Changsha, with 30,000 Japanese soldiers killed or wounded. Looking at the Japanese military actions last year, at least one impression is given, one is that they are in a hurry and have no definite goal, and the other is that large-scale military actions have been severely damaged by the Chinese army and cannot be advanced.

Japanese Objectives Have Become Confused

The biggest achievement of the Japanese army last year was the successful surprise attack on Qinzhou and the occupation of Nanning. Since the Japanese army could not defeat the Chinese army in the hinterland, they wanted to cut off China's international passage and use "economic strangulation" to complete her aggression, but the landing in Qinzhou and the occupation of Nanning did not achieve her expected goals. After the Japanese army occupied Nanning, they were trapped in a semi-circular encirclement by the Chinese army, entering and exiting several times, and still failed to move north to Liuzhou and west to Longzhou to cut off the international transportation line from Longzhou to Vietnam.

Starting in 1940, Japan wanted to invade Guangdong and Hunan from the Yuehan Line, so as to respond to the Japanese army in Guinan, but as a result of the large-scale invasion, the Chinese army in northern Guangdong explored a strong force, and the Japanese army was forced to retreat to the vicinity of Guangzhou.

Exerting the Power of Guerrilla Warfare

In summary, none of the Japanese army's military actions in 1939 can be said to have achieved her expected goals. In the future, China must not only use regular troops to prevent the advance of the Japanese army, but also use guerrilla troops to disturb the rear of the Japanese army. This tactic has exerted great power in North China. The activities of guerrilla warfare in Shanxi have made no progress in the Japanese military in North China. The Japanese army has long shouted the slogan of eliminating guerrilla teams, but the Japanese army's eight general offensives in Shanxi Province last year have all failed, proving that the power of the guerrillas is not to be insulted. The recent great victory in western Sui is another proof of the success of mobile warfare.

Political Offensive Will Surely Fail

Therefore, from the perspective of the situation of the Japanese invasion of China, due to the effectiveness of China's long-term war of resistance, due to the excessive length of the Japanese army's points and lines, and the defensive measures, due to the decline of the Japanese army's morale and the rise of domestic anti-war sentiment, Japan has no possibility of defeating the main force of China in the war. On the contrary, the longer the time, the weaker the power will be. This result makes the Japanese warlords anxious, and they are eager to solve the "Sino-Japanese Incident" as soon as possible. At present, the military offensive has been transformed into a political offensive. The establishment of pseudo-organizations is to use Chinese to control Chinese in order to achieve her goal of winning without fighting. Japan's attempt will obviously fail. China's determination to seek freedom and independence will become more firm due to the recent military trend of advantage, and it will never be deceived by Japan's tricks, and there will be no change in the basic policy of resisting to the end.

### The Masterminds of the Wang-Japan Secret Agreement: Abe's Special Envoy's Entourage, Kagesa and Inukai

— Wei

After the establishment of the Wang regime in Nanjing this time, the Japanese government appointed Abe Nobuyuki as a special envoy, preparing to conduct peace negotiations, adjust Sino-Japanese relations, and build the so-called "New Order in East Asia" in order to realize her dream of destroying China. Abe has now come to China with a large entourage, many of whom are capable. Among them are two people, one is the military faction Kagesa Sadaki, and the other is the parliamentary faction Inukai Ken. Both are familiar with the Chinese situation, and they are the initiators of the Wang-Japan secret agreement, which is worthy of our attention.

Kagesa, a native of Hiroshima Prefecture, is a graduate of the 26th class of the Military Academy. He has worked in Nanjing, Shanghai and other places. Before the July 7th Incident, he was the "China Group Leader" of the Japanese General Staff Headquarters. As the war developed, his position also rose accordingly. He not only directed the war, but also had close contact with all aspects of domestic affairs, diplomacy, and economy. In June of the following year, he was promoted to the head of the Military Affairs Section of the Japanese Army Ministry.

Japan mobilized its troops, wanting to conquer China in one breath by force, but it encountered China's strong resistance and fell into a quagmire, making it difficult to extricate itself. Therefore, it came up with a surprise plan, wanting to seek relief from the political aspect. Therefore, in November of the year before last, the Konoe statement appeared, and today, the Nanjing regime has been established. This policy of going hand in hand with politics and military affairs, who do you say is the mastermind behind the scenes, but it is Kagesa's proud work. Therefore, he must have many tricks to play this time when he comes with Abe.

Inukai Ken is a student in the Faculty of Arts at the University of Tokyo. His father, Inukai Ki, was the president of the Seiyukai after Tanaka. During the Hamaguchi Cabinet era, when the general election was held, Inukai was elected as a member of parliament in the second district of Tokyo as a man of letters. This was due to the support of the literary world and the origin of his family.

Inukai has been active in China since the summer of last year. During the current parliament's discussion on the regime's affairs, Inukai made a strong explanation to the cabinet members and members of the House of Peers and Representatives. He achieved extraordinary success, precisely because he was not a military man, he was even more trusted by the parliament, so after his speech, several members of parliament came forward to shake hands and express their admiration.

Inukai's relationship with China also occurred because of Inukai Ki. Ki was an old friend of President Sun, and he also participated in the funeral ceremony when President Sun passed away. At that time, Inukai Ken also accompanied him. He had met all the leaders of the Kuomintang.

During his student days, he had many literary works, such as "The Success of the Duck", "An Era", and "A Night in Nanjing", which were all loved by people, especially the novel "Actress" left a deep impression on readers.

Kagesa and Inukai believe that they have a progressive understanding of China. Kagesa criticized domestic politicians, saying that their understanding of China inevitably has the shortcomings of being ununified and chaotic. He said that it is wrong to see China as a special country that is beyond the political laws of world history. It is even more wrong to see China as it was during the Sino-Japanese War. The occurrence of the Sino-Japanese Incident was due to Japan's misunderstanding of China. Now, if we want to overcome the difficulties of the incident, we must go through a long period of time, and both sides must reflect on each other and change their old views before there is hope.

### Anesthetics: Japan's New Weapon

— Zhou, translated from the original by Oarl Craw

Anesthetics—opium, morphine, and heroin—are the bayonets of Japan's military aggression against China.

Anesthetic Dealers as Vanguards

Using anesthetic dealers as vanguards to corrupt the people, especially the strong men of fighting age, they paved the way for military victory. The schemes of the special service agencies made the Chinese indulge in them, these Chinese may become dangerous leaders to the conquerors. Anesthetic vendors, in teams coming with the army, keep the people enslaved, while also profiting from it. The drug trade helps the finances of the Japanese army.

Japan is knowingly committing crimes. Japanese laws punish drug addiction the most severely in the world and are strictly enforced. To give one example, just having a opium pipe can result in seven years of hard labor. Booklets are distributed to the soldiers, one section of which says: "The enjoyment of anesthetics is not worthy of a superior race like the Japanese. Only inferior races, those that are declining, such as the Chinese, Europeans, and East Indians, indulge in the enjoyment of anesthetics. That's why their fate is determined to be our slaves, and the result is extinction."

When they seized Manchuria, the Japanese first grasped the potential of anesthetics as a means of conquest. The opium-addicted Manchurian army fled or surrendered without resistance. Therefore, the Japanese army engaged in the use of anesthetics, preparing the procedures for conquering North China. The army The Japanese diplomats paved the way for the Korean vendors who were sent in. At home, Koreans do not have civil rights; the lowest Japanese can whip Korean nobles without being punished. But when the lowly people of Seoul came to China and began selling anesthetics, they became important representatives of the royal family. If arrested by the Chinese police, the Japanese police forced their release.

In this way, areas of China controlled by the Japanese were filled with anesthetics—sold openly like soap or kerosene. Every American expatriate in Shanghai, Guangdong, Beijing, Suzhou, Nanjing, and Hankou was terrified by these disasters. The drug policy was most successful in Nanjing. Three years ago, Nanjing, like any American city, had no anesthetics. Under Chinese rule, it was impossible to buy anesthetics without a doctor's certificate. Even before rape and looting stopped, the Japanese had already begun publicly selling opium, morphine, and heroin.

### Map of the Current Situation of the Sino-Japanese War

## Page 12

As U.S. Navy Major Fletcher said, "Disease and war have always been together, but it has been left to the Japanese to find a way to pay for the war from disease."

Recent Drug Trafficking Situation

According to a survey by British and American residents, at the beginning of 1939, there were 50,000 people in Nanjing—one-eighth of the total population—who were addicted to drugs. According to a recent report, the estimate is one-quarter to one-third of the total population. The Nanjing Opium Public Sale Office, which calls itself the Anti-Smoking Bureau, has a monthly turnover of 5 million yuan, which can be used to support 200,000 people.

There are 500 stores selling anesthetics in Beijing, more than any other industry. A quiet little street where I lived in Shanghai three years ago is now filled with opium dens and drug stores.

In the 1939 budget of "Manchukuo," the opium tax was 71 million yen, an increase of 24 million yen compared with 1938. A few months later, officials stated that the tax revenue could exceed 90 million yen. At one time, the opium tax ranked second in tax revenue, and if the current rate of increase continues unabated, it may reach first place. "Manchukuo" can very appropriately decorate its banknotes with poppy flowers.

The average annual opium production in Korea is usually one ton. It increased to five tons in 1931, seven tons in 1932, and fourteen tons in 1933. In 1937, due to the China Incident, there was a new need for the application of opium, which almost reached 30 tons.

From 1928 to 1934; the average number of Persian opium exports per year, including these two years, was about 500 tons. In 1935, the Japanese army was the main customer, and the export of Persian opium jumped to a new height of 833 tons. In 1936, it increased again to an alarming total of 1,346 tons. Some of the opium was loaded on ships flying the Japanese military transport flag and transported directly to the army. It can be seen that the war of anesthetics is too beneficial and important for the current victory of the army and the subsequent maintenance of the depraved nation's slavery to the conquerors.

### Talking About National Goods with Overseas Chinese Merchants

— Mao Sun

The Mentality of the Locals Should Also Be Noted

In addition to being sold in various parts of the country, our country's national goods are also sold in Southeast Asia in the largest quantity. Before the war, there were many national goods transported to Southeast Asia. Since the outbreak of the war, domestic transportation has been inconvenient, and overseas Chinese have been stimulated by the war, which has further increased their enthusiasm for using national goods. Therefore, in recent years, the goods manufactured by Shanghai national goods factories have been transported to Southeast Asia in large quantities, except for a part that is transported to the mainland. In addition, the exchange rate between the legal currency and Southeast Asian currencies and Hong Kong dollars has recently been too large, which is a good opportunity for national goods to be sold in Southeast Asia. Therefore, those who handle the export of national goods are paying attention to Southeast Asia, and overseas Chinese merchants who return to the country to investigate and purchase national goods are also coming and going. In order to understand the opinions of overseas Chinese merchants on national goods and the quality and types of national goods sold in Southeast Asia, the reporter specially visited a gentleman who had just come to Shanghai from Southeast Asia to purchase goods. He was kind enough to inform the following points:

In the current situation, the national goods that sell the most in Southeast Asia are fabrics, daily necessities, food, electrical appliances, condiments, glassware, enamel steel utensils, and silk. Before the war, because Japanese goods were dumped in Southeast Asia in large quantities, national goods in Southeast Asia could not be developed as much as possible due to various reasons. Since the Sino-Japanese and European wars have occurred one after another, on the one hand, the output of Japanese goods has gradually decreased, and European goods cannot be transported to Southeast Asia in large quantities due to the war, which is a very good opportunity for national goods to dominate Southeast Asia. However, there are several points that must be paid attention to when national goods are transported to Southeast Asia, that is, the consumers are not entirely overseas Chinese, but also include a large number of locals. Because the locals in Southeast Asia do not engage in production, the consumer goods they need every day are dependent on others and cannot be produced by themselves. As long as the goods can cater to their mentality and meet their needs, they do not care which country's goods they are. Because of this, the goods sold in Southeast Asia must be able to cater to the mentality and needs of overseas Chinese and locals. Secondly, the packaging of goods transported to Southeast Asia must be paid attention to, because poor packaging will cause the goods to be damaged, causing the distributors to suffer a great loss, and they will not be willing to purchase them again in the future. National goods in Southeast Asia are competing with European and American goods and Japanese goods. If they do not improve their quality and style at any time, it is difficult to gain a permanent foothold. Advertising should also be paid attention to. If national goods can do more advertising in various parts of Southeast Asia, their impressions will penetrate into the hearts of the people, arousing the belief of the people there, and the future development will be limitless. At present, there is a huge crisis in the promotion of national goods that needs to be solved urgently, that is, the issue of cash and futures. Foreign merchants in Southeast Asia sell a batch of goods and often have a 90-day payment method. The transaction of national goods in Southeast Asia is entirely cash for goods, and there is no fixed payment method.

### Current Lesson

— Bai Yu

Over the past week, due to unprecedented fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, prices of various commodities in Shanghai have risen in tandem. The prices of all essential goods have increased by 20% to 30%, causing anxiety and helplessness among salaried individuals with family responsibilities and housewives in charge of household affairs, who feel unable to cope with the cost of living. Currently, rice, coal, oil, salt, vegetables, clothes, shoes, socks, rent, and transportation are all expensive. While income cannot be increased, the rise in prices seems endless. It is already difficult to manage living expenses for one person, and the anxiety and helplessness of salaried individuals with family responsibilities and housewives in the face of the severe rise in prices is inevitable. The difficulty and distress of living is a serious current problem. Helplessness is not a solution. The tightening of foreign exchange and the rise in prices have their causes. The speculation of foreign exchange traders during the war and the hoarding and manipulation of goods by speculators are certainly factors. However, the massive import of foreign goods, the increase in import surplus, and the outflow of capital are also important reasons. According to the General Customs Administration's report on China's foreign trade in March of this year, the total value of imported foreign goods was 154,193,695 national currency, and the net value of exported domestic goods was 126,273,244 national currency, resulting in an import surplus of 27,920,451 national currency. Although Shanghai's import and export shows a surplus of 2,387,849 national currency in comparison (exports being 76,646,804 national currency, imports being 64,258,955 national currency), the national foreign trade as a whole has an import surplus of over 27 million, which is undoubtedly a major loophole in the wartime economy. We certainly cannot say that we should absolutely not use foreign goods during wartime, but the nation is at war, and the people should endure hardship to preserve some of the country's economic strength. We should not buy foreign goods unless absolutely necessary. According to the General Customs Administration's report, the total value of imported fruits, nuts, and vegetables alone in March was 2,252,339 Customs Gold Units, equivalent to over 6 million legal currency. Tobacco imports also reached over 1.9 million gold units, equivalent to over 5 million legal currency. Other unnecessary luxury goods and cosmetics are not included, but the import of fruits, nuts, vegetables, and tobacco alone has reached over 11 million yuan. No wonder Mr. Gui, an overseas Chinese from Southeast Asia, upon arriving in Shanghai, felt that the extravagance and extreme desires of the Shanghai people were unacceptable to anyone with a conscience. At present, foreign exchange rates are fluctuating dramatically, and prices are rising. Anyone who feels the hardship of living should not be helpless and distressed, let alone blame heaven and earth. Everyone should first reflect on themselves. The creation of this phenomenon is not the responsibility of one person. Everyone who buys foreign goods should bear a part of the responsibility. The tightening of foreign exchange and the skyrocketing prices of foreign goods are due to the compulsion of objective circumstances. Our purchase of domestic goods has changed from "automatic" to "passive." Not buying foreign goods unless absolutely necessary is the minimum standard of living for wartime citizens. If this cannot be achieved, the current difficulty of living is just the beginning, and the difficulty in the future will be ten or a hundred times greater than today. Consider that the nation is still at war, and the government is making painstaking efforts to maintain foreign exchange rates. However, even for daily consumer goods, down to the smallest item like fruit, people still prefer American oranges and California apples. No matter how strong the government is and how abundant the stabilization fund is, how can it maintain the legal price of foreign exchange? The causes of this dramatic change in foreign exchange rates are very complex, and the impact is certainly very significant. However, the most affected are the general salaried class and housewives. In addition to tightening our belts to overcome this difficulty, there is something else we must pay attention to. Since we have suffered from the tightening of foreign exchange rates, no one should easily spend a single cent of foreign exchange in the future. In other words, we should not easily buy a single foreign product for the sake of the nation, the country, and even ourselves. This is a reflection given to us by the current lesson.

### Beware of Hoarding Domestic Goods

— Jing Cun

On the second of this month, the black market exchange rate suddenly changed, and the market reacted immediately. Everyone knows that as foreign exchange tightens, prices will rise. As a result, those with money rushed to buy large quantities of goods. It is said that the sales of the China National Products Company on Nanjing Road reached more than 60,000 yuan on this day, and customers were buying goods as if they were snatching them. These people who went to the company to buy goods did so entirely to avoid the losses caused by rising prices and had no choice but to buy more. This group of people certainly cannot be considered hoarders; they were simply doing what they had to do to protect their own interests. Seeing this situation reminded me of the high prices in the past. The tightening of foreign exchange rates was certainly a reason, but the hoarding and speculation of speculators was also an important reason. As foreign exchange tightens, the prices of foreign goods will inevitably rise, and the consumption of domestic goods will inevitably increase. Although some of the raw materials for domestic goods have to be purchased with foreign exchange, it can be asserted that the price increase of domestic goods will not be as severe as that of foreign goods. With this change in foreign exchange, the consumption of domestic goods has increased, and it is not impossible for speculators to turn their attention to domestic goods. To safeguard the lives of the public and prevent profiteering by speculators, we must loudly shout a slogan: "Beware of hoarding domestic goods!"

The speculators who engage in the hoarding of goods are certainly not scattered buyers, but large-scale bulk buyers. The coal merchant's warehouse receipts in the past are an example. At this time of unprecedented tightening of foreign exchange, domestic goods factories should be very careful about accepting orders and issuing order forms. Once the order forms fall into the hands of speculators, they immediately become the speculators' bargaining chips and are traded around. The goods cannot be sold on the market, and the prices also rise as a result. The producers and consumers lose contact and are instead manipulated and played by the speculators. This is detrimental to both producers and consumers, and it is hoped that domestic goods factories will pay close attention.

Industrial Introduction

### The Production Method of Two Small Industries

— Xiongsheng

In our industrially backward country, the average citizen has little interest in industry. Now, I will introduce to you the simple production methods of two small industries. You might as well spend some money and time to make them, and that will arouse your interest!

A. Soap Production Method:

I. Materials:

(1) Tallow - 8 pounds
(2) Coconut Oil - 3 pounds
(3) Potassium Hydroxide - 14 taels
(4) Water - 25 pounds
(5) Baking Soda - a little
(6) Water Glass - a little

II. Production Method:

First, put the tallow and coconut oil in a pot and boil. Then, add potassium hydroxide, followed by an appropriate amount of water. Add a little baking soda, pour in the remaining water, and add water glass to increase the weight. Add rosin to make it foam. After freezing and solidifying, it can be used.

B. Ink Production Method:

I. Materials:

(1) Gallnuts - 3 cubic centimeters
(2) Water - 30 cubic centimeters
(3) Sulfuric Acid - a little
(4) Indigo - 2 cubic centimeters
(5) Ferrous Sulfate - 1 cubic centimeter
(6) Gum Arabic - 1 cubic centimeter

II. Production Method:

First, grind the gallnuts into a fine powder, add 30 cubic centimeters of water, and boil for five minutes. The liquid will then contain tannic acid. Filter it. Next, dissolve 1 cubic centimeter of ferrous sulfate in 10 cubic centimeters of water. Dissolve 2 cubic centimeters of indigo and 1 cubic centimeter of gum arabic each in 5 cubic centimeters of water. Then, mix all the prepared liquids together and stir. Add a drop of sulfuric acid, and blue ink is ready. To make different colors, simply change to different pigments.

### A Must-Have Item for the Family: The Production Method of Absorbent Cotton

— Xiongsheng

Raw Materials

(1) Cotton 47 taels.

(2) Caustic soda solution (made by dissolving 4 taels and 5 mace of pure caustic soda in 19 taels of water).

(3) Bleach (made by mixing 5 taels of bleaching powder in 18 taels of water and filtering it).

(4) Hydrochloric acid solution (made by mixing 1 tael and 2 mace of hydrochloric acid with 19 taels of water)

Production Method

(1) Put the cotton in the caustic soda solution and boil for about two hours, then take it out and remove the water.

(2) Put the previous cotton into the bleach to bleach it. After it is white, take it out and wring it dry.

(3) Place the wrung cotton in hydrochloric acid water for about one hour, take it out and dry it in the sun.

(4) Put the sun-dried cotton back into carbonic acid, soak it thoroughly, take it out, and dry it in the sun.

(5) Fluff the sun-dried cotton, and it is ready.

### Developments in the Domestic Goods Industry

Mr. Li Xiaoyan, the manager of the Singapore China National Products Company, recently came to Shanghai to purchase various domestic products. It is said that Singapore has recently imposed various restrictions on the import of foreign goods, and the market there is slightly inferior to before. However, due to the patriotic feelings of the overseas Chinese, domestic goods still have a large market in Singapore.

Mr. Shi Zhizhen of the Changchen Factory recently came to Shanghai and reported that the factory has now started production.

Mr. Huang Lizhong of the Jincheng Arts and Crafts Society went to the mainland to investigate the stationery industry and plans to set up a branch factory. He has now completed the investigation and will return to Shanghai soon.

Mr. Wu Gengmei of the China Pencil Factory sent Mr. Guo Zichun to Shanghai to prepare for the establishment of the Shanghai Pencil Factory. He has already purchased land and built a building, and it is expected to start construction next month.

### Being a Person of the World (II)

I was very frightened when I heard this at the time. Later, as my knowledge increased, I gradually understood that this fear was unfounded, because this sun does not know how many tens of millions of years it can still burn. But there is a kind of fear that is not unfounded, that is, science is progressing so fast that this world may become unsuitable for habitation due to the explosion of human desires. For this reason, people today have an urgent need that has never been seen in history before. About four thousand and five hundred years after the Christian era, a barbarian tribe in Asia invaded Rome and wanted Rome to pay tribute. The people at that time called these barbarians Huns. What are Huns? They are not beasts, nor are they demons, but a kind of short people. Like others, they have a heart, but a small heart. They have compassion, but class-based compassion. They have ideals, but selfish ideals. They have a sense of duty, but a narrow, limited sense of duty. During the last European war, the Allied countries often scolded the Germans as Huns. But in a broad sense, this kind of person is not only found in Germany, but also among the working class, stubborn employers, partisan politicians, and stubborn pastors. In essence, anyone with narrow-minded thoughts, class-based compassion, and limited service is this kind of person. In the age of science, this kind of person is a threat to the world, whether in peace or war. Science and Huns, these two things, make the world terrible. Without science, the Huns are only a local threat. With science, they become a threat to the world. Unless these two things sever their relationship, the world will inevitably face war one day. Some people comfort themselves by saying that the last world war was the last war, but I think it is the beginning of many world wars, and future wars will be more severe than the last. Therefore, the connection between science and the Huns must be broken, or science must be eradicated, or the Huns must be eliminated. One of the two must be removed. (To be continued) For detailed research, please send a letter to mailbox No. 1227.

### Another Bad Habit to Be Eradicated

— He Yichang

This publication recently carried an article entitled "Several Bad Habits That Should Be Abolished": Little friends, I presume you have already seen it. But in my opinion, in addition to the three bad habits of "eating snacks, reading comic books, and scribbling on paper," there is another bad habit that is easy to pick up and should be eradicated as soon as possible. This bad habit is "gambling," which is especially important in comparison. Nowadays, small businesses selling candy on the streets often involve gambling. They use candy, toys, etc. to lure children and swindle them out of their money. They carry all kinds of gambling tools and use various methods, such as "spinning candy carts, rolling dice, drawing Pai Gow, and drawing playing cards." In particular, drawing playing cards is the most common. They use several playing cards with several words written on them, such as "Aviation Saves the Country" and "The Civet Cat Exchanges the Prince." If it lands on a word and the one drawn is the same, you can win a prize. Once, I personally saw a primary school student in his teens, carrying a schoolbag, playing this kind of gambling at a candy stand. At first, he bet only a few cents, but later, after losing, he persevered. In less than a few minutes, he lost 8 jiao in legal currency. This kind of gambling is most common in front of primary schools and when school is dismissed. They shout "Give it a try, come and see." Little friends, driven by luck and thinking it is fun, often join in unconsciously. You should know that this kind of bad habit wastes money, hinders academic progress, and cultivates a gambling addiction from a young age, which will have unimaginable consequences in the future. Moreover, what you win is just candy and other things. Eating too much will also harm your health. There is also a kind of "gambling stall" on the side of the road, displaying various toys that are desirable, but secretly setting up traps. There are six or seven accomplices. They are all hooligans and rogues who swindle people out of their money. Little friends should stay away from them and never be fooled. In short, this kind of small business that lures people into gambling, on the one hand, we should hope that the police authorities will severely crack down on it. On the other hand, parents should constantly warn them, so that little friends can understand the harm in this and find other appropriate and beneficial pastimes during their time off from class!

### A Casual Talk About Weight

— Long Jusheng

Tomorrow, May 6th, is the season of Lichun (Start of Summer) again. There is a custom of "weighing people." In childhood, I found "weighing people at Lichun" very interesting.

The original meaning of "weighing people" is to measure a person's weight as an indication of whether or not they are healthy. However, there are those who are stout but often sick, and those who are thin but full of energy. This is probably due to different adjustments in nutrition and diet, resulting in different conditions. What good is being stout if you are starving or overeating? What harm is being thin if you are eating three meals a day evenly?

My three children at school seem to be frail and skinny (because my family is not wealthy, and I rely on mental and physical labor to earn their rewards to feed them, but it is only coarse food and bland meals. They do not have the morning milk and evening ginseng to nourish them like wealthy families.) In fact, they jump and run and never get sick all year round. This is also because I strictly limit my children to eat evenly three meals a day and absolutely prohibit the bad habit of eating snacks. So, their weight is far from that of the children of wealthy families, but their spirits are always healthy and lively. My eldest child, Xisheng, is 14 years old, 52 inches tall, and weighs 53 pounds. His physical education score is 70. My second child, Xixian, is 11 years old, 47.2 inches tall, and weighs 45 pounds. His physical education score is 76. My third child, Xizeng, is 9 years old. He is 41 inches tall and weighs 40 pounds. His physical education score is 70. How can the weight of each of the three children reach the standard of health? (Wealthy families' babies weigh 10 pounds or 15 pounds when they are born.)

Little friends, it is certainly not to be ignored to pay attention to your own weight, but I think it is even more important to pay attention to adjusting (evenly) your three meals a day and to abstain from snacks. I hope you will experience it and put it into practice.

### Visiting Zhao Feng Garden

— Huisheng

That Sunday, the weather was fine, and the spring sunshine was bright. In the morning, I returned home from school after completing my moral education class. My father said, "The weather is so nice today. After lunch, we will go to Zhao Feng Garden to play." I was very happy to hear that. After lunch, my father set off with me and my sister.

We first took the No. 24 trolleybus from the intersection of Lafayette Road and Sappho Road to the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road, and then changed to the No. 1 double-decker bus, which took us directly to Zhao Feng Garden. We saw that the entrance was full of cars and crowded with people. The ticket booth was crowded with people, especially crowded. My father spent a lot of effort to buy the tickets.

Entering the garden gate, a green color was presented before our eyes. Tourists were like ants, men, women, old and young, wearing colorful spring clothes, reflecting the bright flowers and plants, especially beautiful. There were particularly many Japanese men, women, and children, which made me feel very emotional!

We walked to the pond, surrounded by many people. Several children were playing with small sailboats by the pond, drifting in the pond, speeding in the wind, which was very beautiful. We lingered for a while and then walked to the left. We walked into a tall grove of trees and saw a pair of stone statues standing on both sides. Passing through the stone people, we found a red house like an ancient temple, where many people were resting. There was a pair of stone horses in front of the gate, and my sister and I competed to ride on them. We went around to the back of the temple and climbed a dirt mound, where many bamboos had been newly planted, but unfortunately, they had not yet grown lush. I looked out at the garden from the top and saw that the entire garden was full of tourists.

Going down the earth mountain, we walked along the winding path into the depths of the forest. We were like explorers searching for the zoo. Winding and winding, we walked many roads and passed the British barracks before we found the zoo. The first thing we saw was a group of tall, long-beaked cranes. My sister and I were seeing real cranes for the first time, and we found it very interesting. Walking into a small house, on one side were many beautiful birds, chirping; on the other side were monkeys, and some people were playing with them. Walking out of the house, we saw two very large black bears. Along the iron railings on one side, there were long-tailed peacocks, eagles, chickens, and various unknown birds with brightly colored feathers. On the other side, there was also a pair of tall deer, all very interesting.

We left the zoo and walked along another secluded path into the trees and flowers. There were small bridges, flowing water, and rockeries. The surrounding trees were dense, and various flowers were blooming in bright colors, with a fragrant aroma, making people feel indescribably happy! A woman was sketching, depicting the colorful flowers and trees in front of her. We seemed to be in a painting, but we felt that the painting could not fully depict it!

Walking out of the flowers, we arrived at a corner of the lawn, where many girls were playing volleyball. We walked straight to the east and crossed the large lawn to the small mountains on the east side. The small dirt mountains there were planted with lush pines, cypresses, flowers, and plants; at the foot of the mountain was a clear stream; it was like a miniature of high mountains and great rivers, with a different kind of interest.

Finally, we sat resting under the trees, eating sweet and cool purple ice cream. The three-hour tour of the garden made our legs a little sore. The crowds of tourists in front of us were constantly coming and going, as if it was the bustling Nanjing Road. Shanghai has so many people!

After resting for a while, we dragged our heavy steps onto the road home.

### Shirley Temple's Autobiography (I)

— Min

Caggie, sit up now, and I'll tell you a story; this story is about everything about me. You have to be mentioned in it, but it only takes up a very small part, because you are just a little Scottish dog.

Mom and Dad, my two older brothers, Jack and John, are also characters in this story. In addition, there are five rabbits, two speckled turtles, a curly-haired dog Rotae, and dolls sent from various places, including Italy, France, London, New York, Japan, and Honolulu. As for people, there are Janet Gaynor, Winfield Sheehan, my teacher Miss Buckland, Jimmy Dunn (who I love the most now), Gary Cooper, Mr. Will Rogers, who unfortunately died tragically last year, and Jack Donahue - in short, just prick up your ears and listen. You're just a little dog and don't know anything. I'm six years old and I'm growing up.

This story begins back in 1929, Caggie, the year I was born. Mom and Dad, and Dad's friends at the bank (Dad is a manager at a bank in Los Angeles), often call me "the Depression Baby." It was the year the national economy collapsed.

I didn't understand anything about collapse or non-collapse at the time, and I thought it was a lucky synonym, at least it was a lucky one for our Temple family. At the Academy Awards banquet last year, that red-faced and great Mr. Irving Thalberg gave me a little gold statue and said that Santa Claus dropped me down the chimney into the world, and that was good luck for millions of people everywhere. From this statement, it can be seen that this "Depression Baby" Shirley is not so bad.

Too bad you didn't see the house we used to live in. It wasn't as big as our current house, with only five small rooms and a garden. My crib was placed in Mom and Dad's bedroom, and I was always with the two of them. Now I live in a room by myself, which is just right for putting all my dolls in. Mom and Dad also have their own room; even the two older children share a room. (John is at the military academy in New Mexico, so he doesn't actually enjoy the right) There is also a room downstairs, where my secretary, Dorothy Sandler, opens the many letters sent to me by fans and sends out my photos. In addition, there is a large kitchen, a dining room, and a beautiful and lovely hallway.

### Madman

— San San

Before the First World War, a German madman who cried and laughed erratically lived on the eastern border of France. He had a strange habit of always going to the barren mountains to catch butterflies during the day. When it rained, he would spend the whole day in his house burying himself in drawing different butterflies. He lived alone like this and didn't mess with people, so people didn't pay attention to him.

After the outbreak of the war, the German General Staff suddenly had a young and handsome officer with an unfamiliar face who was studying military maps on the wall and contributing his novel strategies. Little friends, do you know who he is? He is the madman who drew butterflies!

It turned out that he was a German spy who had been assigned to the French border to scout the terrain of French fortresses. The butterflies he drew, when put together, were very detailed maps of the French eastern fortresses!

Little friends, would you like to be a sacred and mysterious little spy and serve your motherland?

### A Casual Discussion on Costume Dramas

— Junmei

Last year, when Ms. Chen Yunshang was invited to Shanghai to film the costume drama "Mulan Joins the Army," I wrote an article in this publication about "Mulan Joins the Army." I hoped that Ms. Chen would bring "a glorious contribution to sweep away the demonic atmosphere and refresh the eyes and ears," and that the filmmakers would "not focus too much on business and neglect reality." Although the release of "Mulan Joins the Army" did not achieve my expected result of "inspiring national spirit," it was still relatively correct in its consciousness in this isolated island at this time and place, when it was filled with荒淫,神怪 all sorts of evil atmospheres.

In order to adapt to the special environment of this time and place, we naturally have nothing to say about making historical costume dramas to strengthen the audience's weakened will, and only by doing so can the producers grasp a more correct line of development. We do not bear to blame the playwrights, directors, and even the actors for this inevitable predicament.

But what is the impression that costume dramas have given us in the past year?

Because the material for costume dramas is quite extensive, under the smoke of history and costumes, costume dramas have become increasingly bizarre. As long as there is a female lead and the story is quite lively and familiar, from Investiture of the Gods, Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Journey to the West, Water Margin, Dream of the Red Chamber, Romance of the West Chamber, to Conquest of the East, Conquest of the West, and even folk legends deeply imprinted in the minds of the lower classes, taking one corner of it can be made into a film. Although there is no lack of more profound meaning among them, there are also quite a few that deliberately reveal sensual, feudal, decadent, and mysterious ideas. Is this development of costume dramas what we expected at the beginning?

Mr. Lu Xun, as a literary master of his generation, could not turn the rewriting of old stories into a 洋洋巨著 of millions of words. The reason is that Mr. Lu Xun was not embarrassed by the material. He did not want to produce shoddy goods to deceive readers. The reason is very simple. Therefore, we feel that making costume dramas at this time and place has the same meaning as Mr. Lu Xun's rewriting of old stories. Putting aside all the theories of old wine in new bottles, new wine in old bottles, etc., it is inexcusable to harm the audience. We really have to have this feeling about the ever-declining quality of costume dramas.

In principle, we still do not oppose historical costume dramas, but we hope that those who make costume dramas will be brave enough to correct their mistakes. "Sticking to the old ways" is certainly undesirable, and "only pursuing profit" is really not worth learning from. Moreover, just钻，钻！钻！ into the dead end of costume dramas, will there not be a day when the iron is drilled to the end?

### Notes on Entertaining Cheng Yanqiu

— Xinggu

The Shanghai Drama School was established in the winter of last year, presided over by Xu Xiaochu, Chen Chengyin, Yu Yungu, etc. The school is located at the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Rue de Maran, which is the original site of the Diaochan Tea Room. Since its opening, it has only been four months, but the achievements have been quite remarkable. During the training, the school authorities have successively invited celebrities from all walks of life and Peking Opera actors to visit. They all praised the school's achievements. The day before yesterday, the school held another tea party, which was held to entertain Cheng Yanqiu. The time was 5 pm. In addition to Cheng Yanqiu, Jiang Miaoxiang, Liu Lianrong, and Wu Fuqin, the celebrities invited to accompany them included Lin Kanghou, Xu Jiying, Yuan Ludeng, and more than 50 others.

During the banquet, Principal Chen reported on the brief history of the school's establishment, and said that soon these boys and girls will meet with the gentlemen and ladies of Shanghai. Then Cheng Yanqiu gave a speech with a very amiable and elegant attitude, worthy of being a famous Dan角.

The prelude program was a chorus of "Wealth and Longevity" by all the male and female students. The second part was a female chorus of "Thinking of the Mortal World", which was very moving. The third part was Peking Opera, which was a six-year-old child singing "Entering the Palace Twice", and the tune was sung to the乙字, which was really not easy. The fourth was "Five Flower Cave" fighting. Originally, the program would end after the fighting, but because Yu Qiaqing also arrived during the "Five Flower Cave" fighting, but the old man was late and did not hear the previous 清唱, so he temporarily added a section of "Four Lang Visits His Mother" and a section of "Five Flower Cave", and it ended in joy at about 7 o'clock.

### Twenty Kinds of Storytelling (7) Yang Naiwu

— Written by Yun, Illustrated by Xiuyan

Doufu Xishi Ju Lanying, nicknamed "Little Cabbage," was famous for her beauty, but she married Ge Xiaoda, who was unattractive!

The neighbor Yang Naiwu and Bi Lanying were of similar age and appearance, and they fell in love with each other. Bi Lanying originally complained about "a colorful phoenix following a crow" and blindly fell in love with Yang Naiwu. Later, Naiwu left home to take the exam, and Zheng Renlai, the son of the magistrate of Yuhang County, took the opportunity to become a guest in her boudoir. Bi Lanying's love affair was hot, and she conspired with Zheng Renlai to poison Ge Xiaoda. After the incident was exposed, she blamed Yang Naiwu, who was forced to confess under torture, and his injustice was not cleared!

Fortunately, his sister Ju Zhen was granted a request to file a complaint. The presiding officer induced Naiwu and Lanying into a room and eavesdropped on their confessions through a wall, and the truth was revealed. This matter is only more than sixty years ago.

### So That's How It Is

— Xiaotian

These few major foreign exchange暴縮, prices have soared, and the market prices are so chaotic that they are inexplicable. People seen in the market during the day all show a kind of flustered look on their faces, but when the red lights come on, stepping into the restaurants, there are still red men and green women, drinking and talking wantonly, laughing and talking loudly. Each theater hangs up the signs of "full house" and "please come early tomorrow." The Huguang Theater parked several armored vehicles in front of it to show anti-German films, but it was also full inside.

Bored, I walked into the dance hall, listening to the melodious music and watching the pairs of partners swaying gracefully on the dance floor. When the music stopped and the lights came on, I couldn't help but look at everyone's faces, and they all showed a beaming look. I went to other entertainment venues to visit, and the same scene was presented. Alas, is it that the more chaotic the market is, the more people treasure wealth? Who is suffering? A dance star came over, and I asked him, "Are you affected by the rising prices?" He smiled and said, "How can I not be affected? Today I went to the stores and bought things worth several hundred yuan, I'm afraid they will rise even more. However, I used to make one or two thousand yuan of dance tickets, but now I have to make three or four thousand." Oh, so that's how it is.
