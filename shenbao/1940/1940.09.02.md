### Vietnam Remains Quiet as Usual; Japan Does Not Seem Likely to Immediately Start Hostilities; Negotiations Still Underway; Yunnan-Vietnam Transportation Not Interrupted; Foreign Media Speculate French May Use German Pressure

Kunming - A traveler who recently flew here from Hanoi stated that everything in Hanoi is quiet as usual, with no signs of impending turmoil. Sources with close ties to Vietnam say that rumors of an imminent Japanese invasion of Vietnam should not be readily believed, as negotiations are still ongoing in Vichy. Before the outcome of the negotiations is determined, the Japanese side is unlikely to take any action. The Yunnan-Vietnam Railway is currently operating as usual, and Chinese goods have resumed exports. However, it is said that the resumption of cargo transport will be a lengthy process, so the number of goods exported is limited. Imports to China are still completely prohibited, but it is said that a list of prohibited goods is currently being drafted and discussed by the Japanese side and the Vietnamese authorities. It is rumored that the express train from Hanoi to Kunming will be restored soon. Part of the railway tracks at the Lao Cai station on the Vietnamese border, previously dismantled by the French authorities, has now been relaid. According to general opinion, for Japan to militarily conquer Vietnam while diplomatic negotiations are ongoing would be a foolish move. A long expedition to Vietnam would take a long time, even under the most favorable circumstances, and require a large number of troops, which is far less beneficial than keeping this force to seek better spoils, such as the Dutch East Indies. Today, Japan is likely to gain commercially valuable rights in Vietnam, such as Vietnam supplying Japan with the rubber, coal, and rice it needs in exchange for Japanese goods. In this way, Japan will not only tightly grasp economic benefits but also enhance its political prestige and prepare the way for future absorption of Vietnam. (One-day Reuters dispatch)

Kunming - According to informed observers here, if the extreme faction of Japan, seeing Vietnam's current weakness, forces its government to take drastic measures on the Vietnam issue, it will make a mistake and incur significant costs. It is now believed that the Japanese inspection team that recently traveled to Vietnam must have discovered its weaknesses and reported them to its government. Japan may use its air force to attack Vietnam, as Vietnam is poorly prepared in terms of aircraft. However, if Japan attacks Vietnam, it may not achieve victory as quickly as in China. Vietnam has a considerable French military force stationed there, as well as foreign troops and a large number of Vietnamese soldiers, but they lack mechanized equipment and war supplies. If Japan takes drastic measures, the French army can also fight them. The "nerve warfare" that the Japanese have conducted so far has been more effective and less costly than actual combat. The Japanese believe that the Vietnamese will not be loyal, but this cannot be relied upon. The French colonial policy in Vietnam has been short-sighted and harsh, but the impoverished Vietnamese may not be willing to help the Japanese against the French. According to rumors here, the Japanese have been quite successful in exploiting the instability following the French armistice. Japanese planes have flown over Vietnamese territory where defenses are located several times, and the orderly nature of their flights suggests they are taking photographs of the area. Japanese planes have also landed at Hanoi military airport and been allowed to fly away without hindrance. When the French initially allowed the Japanese inspection team to go to Hanoi, Japanese military planes often carried so-called inspection team members to Hanoi without prior notification to the French authorities. The inspection team members in Hanoi stayed in the most luxurious hotels, living lavishly, apparently intending to impress the local people. It is said that the French are quite displeased with this attitude, as it is close to being overbearing and seems to reflect their belief that Vietnam is already under their control. It is rumored that Vietnamese Governor-General Admiral Decoux intends to adopt a tougher policy towards the inspection team. (One-day Reuters dispatch)

Macau - Yesterday, Japanese artillery bombarded Lapar Island, causing thousands of spectators to gather in Macau to watch. The Japanese army drove its own puppets off the island. These bogus troops had been extorting residents of various villages and resisting the Japanese army. After being driven out of the villages by the Japanese army, they fled to the island, so the Japanese army bombarded it. When opening fire, the Japanese army carefully avoided damaging the villages and concentrated its fire on mountain locations where the bogus troops were located. (One-day Reuters dispatch)

Stockholm - The conservative Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet reported that the result of Japan's three-year war with China has left it in an extremely difficult situation. The Japanese, because there is no end in sight to the war with China, are on the verge of a nervous breakdown. The situation is punctuated by frequent changes of government, various movements in the newspapers, and sudden attempts to ease the tense situation. Since seizing the German islands in the Pacific, Japan has now obtained its first opportunity to expand southward, but it is unfortunately completely occupied by the war with China. Japan's invasion of Vietnam and the Dutch East Indies will surely win popular support and satisfaction, but at this decisive moment, Japan actually feels its strength is insufficient. Even the Japanese are encountering resistance in Vietnam. Judging from the situation, Germany does not seem to fully approve of Japan's expansion. The Vichy government's firm attitude towards Japan may be dependent on German pressure. (One-day Reuters dispatch)

### One Week of Battle Report: August 25th to 31st

Chongqing - A spokesman for the Military Affairs Commission stated that the battles this week (August 25th to 31st) were more intense in Shanxi, Anhui, Hubei, and Guangxi, while other fronts also gradually became active. The officers and soldiers of the Chinese army will continue their efforts, exert even stronger forces, and create great battle results on the northern and southern battlefields. The operational details are summarized as follows:

Shanxi-Henan - The Chinese army in Shanxi Province launched a fierce attack on Shouyang, Yangquan, Pingding, Niangziguan, and other places in multiple routes. One route besieged Shouyang County, killing more than 800 Japanese soldiers. Another route killed more than 600 Japanese soldiers near Shinnao (southwest of Yangquan). Another route bombarded the city walls of Pingding, and many places inside the city were hit by artillery fire, causing heavy Japanese casualties. Another route captured Niangziguan, seizing countless weapons and supplies. Another elite force took advantage of the situation to recover the Jingxing coal mine. As a result, the vital transportation points along the Japanese Zhengtai Railway were controlled by the Chinese army. The Chinese army in northern Henan launched repeated attacks on the outer strongholds of Qinyang. The Japanese in Kaifeng, eastern Henan, also used intense artillery fire to cover their attempts to invade China, but multiple Japanese artillery pieces were destroyed by Chinese forces, and many Japanese soldiers were killed.

Anhui-Jiangxi - The Chinese army in eastern Anhui continued to besiege the Japanese army near Wuwei. This week, the Japanese launched a large-scale reinforcement and turned to attack Xiang'anzhen fiercely. On the 24th, they briefly broke into the town, but were surrounded and severely attacked by the Chinese forces. By the morning of the 25th, more than 600 Japanese soldiers had been killed, and the Chinese army recaptured the town. Later, a unit of the Japanese army attempted to land reinforcements from Fenghuang, but was again defeated by the Chinese army near Zhaojiadu. In addition, a certain unit of the Chinese army launched attacks on the Japanese army in Shou County for several consecutive days. The Japanese occupied the city and defended it, while the Chinese army continued to attack fiercely. The Japanese army between Nanchang and Anyi in northern Jiangxi launched a fierce attack on the Chinese forces from Lei Wangdian and Nan Wangdian on the morning of the 25th. The Chinese army fought bravely to meet the enemy, and the artillery also cooperated in the bombardment. After a fierce battle until noon, more than 300 Japanese soldiers were killed and retreated.

Hubei-Hunan - The Japanese army in the area west of the Xiang River in Hubei Province has been active recently. The Japanese army entrenched in Jiangkouzhen (between Jiangling and Yichang) shelled the northern end of Bailizhou to cover the Japanese troops' invasion, but the Japanese retreated after fierce retaliation from the Chinese forces. The Japanese troops entrenched near Yichang gathered more than a thousand infantry and cavalry troops and harassed the Chinese forces in multiple routes, but they were all repelled by the Chinese army. The Chinese army in the southern section of the Yuehan Railway has been unusually active, and recently damaged many sections of the railway between Yueyang and Xianning, causing traffic to be interrupted again.

Guangxi-Guangdong - This week, the Japanese army in southern Guangxi launched attacks on Shangsi in multiple routes. After a fierce resistance from the Chinese forces, the Japanese could not sustain their position and collapsed. The Chinese forces took advantage of the situation to completely eliminate the remaining Japanese troops near Shangsi. Another Japanese unit attacked Wangjiang, the border between Sile and Mingjiang, but was fiercely attacked by the Chinese forces when they were halfway across the river, and the Japanese retreated to Guangdong. The Japanese troops attacking near Huaxian were defeated by the Chinese forces on the morning of the 27th. A remnant of the Japanese army reached near Shiling Tieba, where the Chinese army continued to encircle and attack, completely annihilating the Japanese troops. In addition, four Japanese warships in the waters of southern Guangdong forcibly landed Japanese troops on the southeastern Jieshi town of Lufeng County on the morning of the 26th at 3:00 AM, carrying them on speedboats. They were fiercely met with resistance from the Chinese army. After a fierce battle until dawn, three Japanese planes came to assist. By evening, the Japanese had suffered heavy casualties and fled by ship. At the same time, a unit of the Chinese elite force attacked Shangxia Chuan Island at midnight on the 27th, and launched a fierce assault on the Japanese camp. They fought hand-to-hand overnight, annihilating all the remaining Japanese troops on the island.

Others - Among the battle achievements of the Chinese army on other fronts, the following are particularly worth reporting: (1) The Chinese army in Suiyuan Province defeated the Japanese troops attacking near Xishan Village and captured a considerable number of spoils. (2) The Chinese army in eastern Hebei recovered Jixian (100 kilometers east of Beiping), posing a great threat to Beiping. (3) The Japanese in Linqu, southern Shandong, launched a large-scale attack southward, but were defeated by the Chinese forces. (4) Fierce battles have taken place near Ganyu, Xiaoxian, Suining, Gaoyou, and Suqian in northern Jiangsu this week, and the Japanese have suffered heavy losses. (One-day dispatch)

### Relief for Northeastern Refugees Still Under the Auspices of Yu Bin

Chongqing - Since the September 18th Incident, many compatriots from the four northeastern provinces have entered the mainland to make a living. Since the full-scale war of resistance, hundreds of thousands of these righteous people have fled to the rear areas. The Northeastern Compatriots organized the Northeastern Refugee Relief Committee in Hankou in previous years, presided over by Bishop Yu Bin, and actively handled relief work, accommodating more than 5,000 refugees. After the Battle of Wuhan, Yu Bin went abroad to raise funds, and the duties he left behind were taken over by National Government member Liu Shangqing, who actively continued to handle them. The government, concerned about the difficult living conditions of the northeastern refugees, allocated special funds as a foundation for relief and production projects. Liu also actively planned to establish a refugee textile factory, open a refugee reception center, and run a refugee vocational training class, integrating relief into production. The textile factory can also accommodate women and children and will be operational soon. Recently, Liu firmly resigned from his position as chairman of the committee. After the Northeastern celebrities in Chongqing retained him unsuccessfully, they publicly invited Bishop Yu Bin to take over. Yu, considering that serving his hometown was an unavoidable duty, took office a few days ago and worked with the standing committee members Liu Shangqing, Mo Dehui, Wan Fulin, Zou Zuohua, Li Du, Wang Jiazhen, and others to plan and actively promote the work. It is heard that the committee is also paying close attention to the issue of resettlement in the Northwest. (One-day dispatch)

Editorial

### U.S. Defense Program and the Far East

The direct result of Germany's victory on the Western Front this summer was to subdue France, isolate Britain, and temporarily replace Britain and France as the leader of Continental Europe for the past twenty-five years. The various parts of the world, stimulated by this, also presented strong reactions. In the Americas, there was the unprecedented U.S. defense program, the unity of Latin America, and the joint defense of U.S. and British possessions. In the Far East, the situation in the South China Sea became increasingly tense, and not only Vietnam and the Dutch East Indies, but also Siam, Burma, Malaya, and the Philippines were shrouded in a new crisis. All of these situations were indirectly promoted by the Nazi victory in the war, but the turbulent evolution of both the Americas and Asia is self-contained and has its own mechanism, not entirely following the progress of the European war. Its impact on the world's fortune is no less than the European war today, which is only capable of mutual bombing.

Comparing the situation in the Far East with that in the West, the fires of war in Asia have already become a prairie fire, and recently have become increasingly intensified and spread. What has been done to stop it, except for China's resistance, has often been slow and weak, failing to fully grasp the opportunity. The threats that the Western Hemisphere may encounter are not as urgent as those in the Far East, but its various emergency measures are far more proactive, forming a clear contrast to the Far East. For example, the United States is now on the eve of the general election, and what is being debated and pursued between the court and the common people is concentrated on how to consolidate national defense and how to strengthen military preparedness. The election issue has become relatively dim, and President Roosevelt, who is allowed to hold a third term, has not said a word about the campaign. Whether this is a silent campaign or not, it is enough to reveal the focus of public and private attention in the United States. Therefore, in the past month or so, there has been the passage and signing of the National Guard Mobilization Act, the discussion of the Conscription Act, the passage of the $5 billion "total defense" bill to build a two-ocean navy and 10,000 fighter planes by both houses of Congress, the achievements of the Havana Conference on ensuring the independence and integrity of the Western Hemisphere, the military joint defense between the United States and Canada, and negotiations on leasing British possessions as military bases. All of these are being pursued diligently and tirelessly, which is not only unprecedented in the history of the United States, but also more than enough to make up for the naval weakness of the previous "ten-year suspension of construction." All of these measures, which are currently being implemented or are just being planned, cannot be immediately said to be sufficient to cope with all current crises, but their speed and aggressiveness exceed any military program of any era or country before. And they are enough to shock those with aggressive ambitions. However, there are still considerable weaknesses in the U.S. national defense construction, such as the unresolved issue of the defense of the Philippines. The recent U.S. measures to focus on the Americas and the Atlantic are also undeniable facts. The world is more aware of the recent U.S. official concern about the Sino-Japanese War and various events in the war, which is quite different from a year ago, when condemnation and protests were often issued when events occurred. Recently, there has been increased silence and no further expressions. As a result, some people cannot help but wonder whether the United States will follow the footsteps of appeasement policy in the Far East.

However, the U.S. Far East policy has been firm and calm for the past ten years, and there is no need to worry about it. It is true that the turmoil and unrest in the Far East is getting worse day by day, but because of this, various problems cannot be solved by empty condemnation or written protests. The United States has also engaged in such means in the past, but the results have been ineffective and even worsened. The next step is to engage in close combat, and there is no other way to follow except to rely on actual strength. At this point, those involved can hardly remain silent while waiting for the military to be strengthened and the equipment to be completed, and then seek a way to clear up the chaos. The unprecedented U.S. defense program should not be interpreted as merely defending against the Atlantic threat, nor can it be said that it is sufficient to protect the Americas. If the "new order" in the Far East is realized, and China and Southeast Asia are all included to form an economic, political, and military group, then not only will the security of the Americas not be guaranteed, but also the economic self-preservation will be difficult. Democratic systems have the disadvantage of having many lawsuits, but it is not true that they are unaware of the national security situation. The U.S. measures do not favor one side over the other, but the steps must be earnestly implemented. Judging from recent facts, the construction of the so-called two-ocean fleet undoubtedly treats the Pacific and Atlantic equally, and makes the progress and retreat on the Pacific no longer constrained by the Atlantic turmoil. The negotiations between Britain and the United States on the leasing of bases initially focused on the Atlantic, but recently it has been reported that they have involved Pacific islands and even Australia and Singapore. The defense of the Philippines is the weakest link in the United States, but now that Philippine President Quezon has appealed, the U.S. is considering sending large numbers of aircraft, ships, and troops. It is likely that the Philippines will form a strong outpost for U.S. defense in the Pacific. In short, there is no need to worry about the U.S. Far East policy.

We pray that the aggression in the Far East will be restrained, and we do not want to see the outbreak of war in the Pacific. However, if the aggressors do not retreat despite the difficulties and act blindly, then those who create the "September 18th Incident" in the Pacific may encounter a new "August 13th Incident" in the Pacific.

### A Thousand German Planes Attack Britain, Berlin's City Center Suffers Heavy Bombing, Bombs Land Near Hitler's Residence, Many German Planes Destroyed in British Air Battles

New York: Yesterday, the British Air Force, for the first time in history, bombed the center of Berlin, destroying many houses and starting fires. The Siemens electrical manufacturing plant was also hit. Bombs also fell near the German government and the residence of Führer Hitler. One bomb landed in the courtyard of a fire brigade. According to news received here this morning, several large fires broke out in Berlin after the British air raids on Saturday and Sunday mornings. Berlin's nightlife has been disrupted, and business has declined because residents fear British air raids and want to return home before the raids. Meanwhile, a report from London states that over a thousand German planes again attacked Britain, dropping bombs and conducting bombing raids on various parts of London. Fierce air battles are in progress. It is reported that German planes are flying low and strafing the streets outside London with machine guns. (1st Reuters dispatch)

London: At 12:53 this morning (8:00 AM Shanghai summer time), German bombers launched a fierce air raid on the London area, commemorating the first anniversary of the German war effort with the deafening sound of bombs and anti-aircraft guns. Over a thousand German bombers and fighters have been attacking since yesterday morning, continuously attempting to break through London's defenses until dawn this morning. According to the Air Ministry, by 9:30 PM last night (5:00 AM Shanghai summer time), 63 German planes had been shot down, and Britain had lost 22 fighters. Last night, the Air Ministry and the Ministry of Home Security issued a joint statement saying that industrial buildings and houses outside London were slightly damaged yesterday, and there were some casualties. The statement continued that, according to reports received at the time of the announcement, British fighters had dispersed the German planes before they could seriously damage Royal Air Force airfields. These airfields appear to have been the main targets of the attack. Civilian casualties are said to be minimal. The statement said that British artillery shelled French ports several times yesterday afternoon. (1st United Press dispatch)

A bomb penetrated the roof and caused a fire. Only the four walls and a tall tower remain. (1st Reuters dispatch)

Heavy Damage on Berlin's Outskirts

London: An Air Ministry communiqué stated that on Friday night, large squadrons of British bombers heavily attacked military targets within the Berlin area. Fires and explosions followed, causing considerable damage. British naval aircraft, together with coastal aircraft, attacked the docks and railway tracks of Boulogne. Another squadron of British aircraft attacked oil depots in Gelsenkirchen and Magdeburg, ships in Emden, warehouses in Hamm, gun emplacements at Cape Gris-Nez, and several airfields in Germany and the Netherlands. Two British aircraft did not return, and three were forced to land on the British coast.

According to Air Ministry intelligence, British bombers directly hit important military targets in Berlin, such as gasoline stations, aircraft factories, and airfields. British aircraft dropped 15 tons of high-explosive bombs and over 750 incendiary bombs, bombing from before midnight until 2:30 AM the next morning. An electrical factory and its nearby railway were damaged. Ten minutes after the bombing ended, the sound of explosions from the factory still had not subsided. An oil depot outside Berlin was attacked, and the flames could be seen 45 miles away. Three airfields in the Berlin area were hit. Another squadron of British aircraft bombed warehouses in the Hamburg docks area, many of which were hit and caught fire. British aircraft also bombed in Bremen, where the fire continued to spread.

Six Alarms in London in One Day

London: Last night, squadrons of German bombers flew high over the coast of Kent and attempted to break through London's defenses, but were unsuccessful. The results of the night battles are not yet fully known as of this morning. Last night, the London area issued its sixth alarm. Large numbers of enemy planes flew over the coast at different speeds, heading towards London, but were intercepted by anti-aircraft guns and fighters, scattering their formations and turning back to the sea. The first alarm was at 8:27 AM, with about 100 German planes attacking. Londoners either took shelter in air raid shelters, stayed at home, or continued to work as usual. At that time, fierce air battles were raging outside London. The second wave consisted of about 50 enemy planes. The third attack was the fiercest. In a street outside London, women were strafed by machine guns, and in another location, several bombs were dropped, destroying about 30 houses. One German plane suddenly dived while being pursued by a British plane, opening fire on Oxford Street, but without injuring anyone. However, in an area outside the city, bombs fell before the alarm sounded, causing several casualties. During the fourth alarm, about 50 enemy planes flew into the London area. British Spitfire fighters attacked from above, scattering the enemy squadron. Two enemy planes were hit and crashed. Civilians in the streets cheered as they watched the air battles. At least four enemy planes made two fierce attempts to break through the outer defenses of the southeast area, but after clashing, four enemy planes were shot down. In an area outside London, enemy planes dropped several bombs in a row, causing extensive damage to many shops. One enemy plane dropped its bombs and fled while being closely pursued by a British plane. During the fourth alarm, 50 enemy planes flew very high, arriving over the London area from the coast. British fighters pursued them, resulting in a fierce battle. Two German planes spiraled downwards, apparently losing control. Shortly afterwards, there was another fierce battle in the southeast area. Forty enemy planes attempted to break in, but were repulsed. After a short while, they regrouped and attacked again.

An Air Ministry communiqué stated that enemy planes attacked an airfield in the southeast area again this morning. Shortly after 7:00 AM, squadrons of enemy planes flew over the coast of Kent, and British Air Force intercepted them, scattering the enemy planes. Shortly afterwards, another squadron of enemy planes flew over the Thames Estuary, attacking an airfield in East Anglia, causing slight damage. The enemy planes were eventually repulsed. An airfield in the Thames Estuary was also attacked, but the enemy planes were still driven back. There were no reports of any serious damage to the airfields. British Spitfire and Hurricane fighters all scrambled to intercept the enemy, disrupting their formations and preventing them from reaching their targets. Spitfire English planes attacked two Messerschmitt German planes, quickly shooting down three of them. Nine Hurricane English planes also destroyed four enemy bombers in less than an hour. Another Hurricane English plane, although hit by bullets, was still able to pursue a Messerschmitt plane, causing it to catch fire and crash. London rescue teams and sanitation teams were busy all day clearing the rubble from residential areas outside the city after the night attacks on Friday. Among the houses destroyed were a post office and a 400-year-old building. Many houses and shops were also damaged. Several people were killed and many injured. (1st Reuters dispatch)

German Side Announces Air Force Battle Situation

Berlin: This afternoon, the German military report stated that German submarines sank the British auxiliary cruiser "Dunottar Castle" (15,000 tons). In the past three days, enemy shipping totaling over 100,000 tons was destroyed. Yesterday, the German Air Force attacked airfields in Kent and Essex, port facilities and ships in the Thames Estuary and Liverpool, and aircraft factories in central England day and night. Many places were hit and caught fire. Yesterday, there were several fierce air battles, with a total of 116 enemy planes shot down. Last night, British planes attacked the Ruhr area and flew towards Berlin, dropping bombs, but military targets were not damaged. Anti-aircraft fire around Berlin was intense, preventing enemy planes from approaching Berlin. Several bombs fell in the remote countryside. In total, 133 enemy planes were lost yesterday, including 116 destroyed in air combat, 3 shot down by anti-aircraft guns at night, 14 destroyed on the ground, and 74 barrage balloons destroyed. 32 German planes are missing.

### Italian Prime Minister's Mouthpiece Warns Greece, Do Not Risk War

Rome: Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's mouthpiece, Gayda, yesterday criticized anti-Italian remarks in Greek newspapers in "The Italian Daily," warning Athens newspapers not to compare ancient Greek glory with ancient Rome. Gayda stated, "Greek newspapers say that Greece has never been defeated since the time of Leonidas. We now want Greece to clearly recall that Greece was attacked and conquered by ancient Roman legions, not just once. Is the Greek newspaper glorifying the events of Thermopylae? It must be known that modern warfare is a war of tanks, artillery, and airplanes, not a dispute of swords and shields as in the past." (1st United Press dispatch)

### Expressing Dissatisfaction with German-Italian Arbitration, Romanian People are Filled with Grief and Indignation, Farmers and Soldiers Bitterly Feel the Shrinking of National Territory, Rise Up in Arms, Not Hesitating to Die in Battle

Bucharest: The Romanian News Agency reported on the situation of the Vienna Conference, saying that Romania had to make concessions to Hungary under the threat of war. The Hungarian side proposed that the Axis powers must be given an immediate reply because the German and Italian diplomatic authorities attending the Vienna Conference were only scheduled to attend for two days. Bucharest is filled with a gloomy atmosphere. The people are indignant at the abandonment of Romania by the Axis powers, and the mood in Outer Transylvania is particularly agitated. However, telephone communications have been cut off, and the situation there is currently difficult to determine. (1st Reuters dispatch)

Bucharest: Manuel, a spokesperson for the province of Outer Transylvania, telegraphed Führer Hitler and Prime Minister Mussolini yesterday, saying, "The Romanian people of Outer Transylvania and Banat will never accept the Vienna verdict," and requested the dictators of the totalitarian countries to cancel it. The General Staff recently informed the United Press that Romanian villagers have occupied the trenches and fortresses evacuated by the Romanian army within the borders of Outer Transylvania and refuse to leave, vowing to die there in battle. News from that area also says that many officers and soldiers in Outer Transylvania have notified the high command that they cannot accept the order to withdraw and have requested permission to remain at their posts, fighting alongside the villagers. Hungary's occupation of Outer Transylvania will begin next week. (1st United Press dispatch)

Bucharest: Regarding the reports from American news agencies and British radio stations about the disturbances in Outer Transylvania, responsible officials here solemnly denied them last night, stating that the rumors were completely untrue and that the situation there was as usual.

### Romanian Foreign Minister Addresses the Nation in a Sorrowful Speech, Concessions to Hungary Were Forced by Circumstances, Future Policy Will Be to Cooperate with the Axis Powers

Bucharest: Romanian Foreign Minister Knollerscu, after returning to the capital from the Vienna Conference yesterday, broadcast to the nation in the evening, saying, "What has happened in the past was inevitable." He declared, "I return here from Vienna with a heavy heart, but if Romania's independence and integrity are once again violated, Germany will fight for Romania." Mr. Ma also stated that Romania will demobilize next week, as stipulated by the Vienna Agreement. He said,

"When the Hungarian Prime Minister and I went to Salzburg and Rome to negotiate the plan for the exchange of people, I had already stated that Romania was prepared to cede considerable territory in exchange for the Hungarian people in Romania. Our policy is to cooperate closely with the Axis powers. The facts of the past are due to the needs of the environment. Our representatives in 'Tornosvir' and 'Vienna' have never automatically proposed ceding land." (1st United Press dispatch)

Bucharest: Four hours after returning to Bucharest from Vienna, the Romanian Foreign Minister gave a speech on the radio, discussing the process of the Vienna arbitration of the Romanian-Hungarian dispute. Mr. Ma first described the procedures adopted at the Vienna Conference, then expressed the Romanian people's sorrow and indignation over the cession of territory, and strongly stated that the foreign ministers of Germany and Italy had formally guaranteed that the ethnic minorities in the ceded areas would be treated well and would regard this issue as an issue of the Axis powers themselves. Mr. Ma continued to describe the Axis powers' guarantee of Romania's borders, believing that this guarantee was extremely important, because Germany had never made a guarantee of this nature except for Slovakia. The result of this guarantee is that Romania is absolutely safe and peace is maintained in Southeastern Europe. Romania will never use this guarantee to adopt an attitude that disrupts peace in order to deal with any neighboring country. After pointing out that Mr. Bubu, the head of the Romanian negotiating delegation in this negotiation, was a native of Outer Transylvania, and that he himself also had close ties with the ceded area, Mr. Ma solemnly stated that all of Romania's future policies must be closely allied with the Axis powers. (1st Huitong dispatch)

Two Paths, Survival or Extinction, Choose One

Bucharest: According to responsible sources here, the Romanian Royal Council, in a very difficult environment, decided to accept the Axis powers' arbitration in the Romanian-Hungarian negotiations. The situation at the Vienna Conference forced Romania to choose between preserving national political survival or the possibility of national extinction. Romania's acceptance of arbitration completely entrusted the resolution of the Romanian-Hungarian dispute to the Axis powers, and what Romania gained was the German and Italian guarantee of its borders. After studying all these possibilities, the Royal Council finally decided that the best way was to accept German and Italian arbitration, because Romania at this time felt that it was in a state of being surrounded by enemies and absolutely isolated. The entire system upon which the diplomatic policies of democratic countries are based has now collapsed without a trace in Europe. In this environment, the only reasonable attitude is to embrace the policies of the Axis powers and accept the consequences of the new situation. Romania's loss this time is indeed very tragic, but the guarantee obtained is of great importance to Romania's survival. At a time when many countries are gradually perishing, Romania can rely on this guarantee to restore its normal life. (1st Reuters dispatch)

### Romanian-Bulgarian Border Map, First Signature Signed, Compensation for Losses, Understanding Not Yet Established

Sofia: According to news received here from Craiova, the maps delineating the borders between Romania and Bulgaria have been signed for the first time by military experts from both countries. The joint Romanian-Bulgarian border commission will go to Southern Dobruja next week to demarcate the border on the spot. (1st Huitong dispatch)

Sofia: Foreign Minister Popov left here last night for Vidin, preparing to meet with Bomanov, the leader of the Bulgarian delegation, today. It is reported that Bomanov carried a draft treaty on the cession of Southern Dobruja to Bulgaria and also left Craiova for Vidin last night. The Romanian Foreign Minister hopes to consider the full text of the treaty in detail before signing it. Well-informed sources here state that an understanding may not be established on the issue of compensation for losses in the ceded area of Romania. It is rumored that Romania is still demanding 100 million to 150 million lei (the name of the Bulgarian currency), but the Bulgarian delegation has no right to accept it without the government's consent. So far, the date for Bulgaria to take over Southern Dobruja has not been determined. Romania insists that it cannot be before September 20, while Bulgaria insists on receiving it within the next fourteen days. (1st Huitong dispatch)

### Germany's Attack on Britain, Decidedly Difficult to Succeed, US Military Delegation, Reports to Washington

London: News last night stated that the US military delegation in Britain will send a report of its investigation to Washington. The report strongly stated that two-thirds of the British coastline is rocky and swampy, making it very difficult for German troops to land. The remaining one-third has been heavily fortified since mid-August. The report also stated that with the arrival of winter, Hitler's activities to attack England will become even more difficult. The report also stated that the results of the German air raids did not prove to be very damaging. The German side said that 300 British airfields were damaged, but in fact, only two or three of these airfields were damaged. Also, the claim that some airfields could not be repaired in one or two days after being damaged is also untrue. The report also stated that in the midst of the intense German attacks, British industry, transportation, telephone, telegraph, postal services, and general daily life were still proceeding as usual. This situation greatly surprised the military delegation. It is reported that the military delegation will also compile reports on the results of its investigation of various military areas in England and conversations with Prime Minister Churchill, other members of the wartime cabinet, leaders of the General Staff, and countless soldiers. These reports are of great value to the US military rearmament. It is also reported that after the military delegation leaves, American naval and army officers also plan to come to England to continue to observe the war. (1st United Press dispatch)

### Some French Colonies, Division Phenomenon Occurs, Demonstrations in Various Places Gradually Subside, It is Reported That Several Military Officers Have Joined the British Army

Vichy: The government publicly acknowledged yesterday that rebellions have occurred in West Africa, Congo, Madagascar, and Indochina. It is reported that the commander of the French garrison in Djibouti recently surrendered to the British army in British Somaliland. Another British radio message said that General Catroux, the commander of the French Far East and Indochina garrisons, has also joined the British army. The government here said that it has not received official reports on this matter. Many other French territories continue to have business relations with British Africa and Australia. (1st United Press dispatch)

Regarding the situation in French colonies in Africa, there are many rumors outside, and some even say that certain colonies have split from France. Foreign journalists often ask about this. Colonial Minister Lemeray recently issued a statement explaining that he had received a telegram from High Commissioner Boisson of French West Africa from Dakar City, saying that all the lands under his jurisdiction are loyal to the French government and have remained unchanged. Although some Europeans in certain places have held demonstrations, the general natives are indifferent. The situation in French Equatorial Africa and Cameroon is also the same. The local authorities have also taken various measures to stop the demonstrations. In addition, the government has begun to develop the economic enterprises of various colonies and has authorized the supply department to purchase the colonies' native products with cash. As for the transportation between African colonies and the mainland, the government is also doing its best to dredge it, such as wireless money transfer and air transportation, so that it can restore its original state, and ensure that the military and political authorities of the colonies maintain contact with the mainland government, and the railway lines in North Africa can dredge cargo transportation. In the future, the amount of food transported from various colonies to France will be increased. Once this economic development plan is implemented step by step, various colonies will become more prosperous day by day. (31st Havas dispatch)

Vichy: The Pétain government announced today that after the rebellions in French West Africa, French Equatorial Africa, and Vietnam were suppressed, order has been fully restored. It is stated that the rebellion in Vietnam only occurred in the garrison commanded by General Cadrou.

The Vichy government has ordered banks to advance funds and purchase a large amount to overcome the difficulties. (1st International dispatch)

### U.S. Estimates that National Defense Resources and Creative Spirit Are Most Valuable, Population Birth Rate Decreases

Washington - The U.S. National Resources Committee recently made a comprehensive assessment of the human and material resources needed for U.S. national defense, stating that the creative spirit of the United States is one of the most valuable assets of the country. It also stated that the United States has a large amount of transportation, communication capabilities, inventors, researchers, and various minerals, all of which can be used for national defense. In terms of transportation, there are 241,404 miles of railways, 2,960,000 miles of highways, 29,038 miles of inland waterways, 35,492 miles of airways, and 65,292 miles of oil pipelines. In terms of communication, there are 2,216 daily newspapers, 11,516 weekly newspapers, 17,097,766 telephones, 571,391 miles of telegraph lines, 8,878 commercial radio stations, 55,000 other radio stations, 44,000,000 radio receivers, and 17,000 theaters. In terms of mineral reserves, there are 4,400,000,000 tons of iron ore, 33,000,000 tons of non-pure copper, 3,000,000 tons of lead ore, 12,000,000 tons of zinc ore, 15,000,000,000 tons of anthracite coal, and 2,500,000,000 tons of bituminous coal. (United Press dispatch of the 1st)

Washington - The National Resources Committee recently warned the United States that the U.S. population is trending towards decline due to the decrease in the birth rate and immigration restrictions. According to the committee's estimates, the 1940 survey may show that the total U.S. population is 221,993,000, while the total U.S. population ten years ago was 122,775,046. Based on this situation, by 1980, it will only be 158,335,000. This increase is due to the increase in the population over 65 years old. However, it also stated that the decrease in natural birth rate and the increase in the number of elderly people are not necessarily unfortunate results. (United Press dispatch of the 1st)

### Dutch East Indies Has Sufficient Self-Defense Capabilities, Submarines as the Main Theme of Sea Defense, Number of Aircraft Also Increases

San Francisco - According to a recent survey by the Pacific International Relations Society, the defense of the Dutch East Indies against foreign attacks is far stronger than commonly imagined. How the strength of the Dutch East Indies has been since 1933 is highly confidential to officials, while non-officials claim that the naval power there includes one battleship, three cruisers, eight destroyers, eighteen submarines, and forty-two torpedo boats. Naval personnel have long acknowledged that submarines are the best tool for naval defense for small countries that cannot equip a large navy, and as far as the general public knows, the number of submarines currently owned by the Dutch East Indies occupies an important position in naval defense, not only can it resist any naval attack, but it can also prevent troop ships from landing soldiers. The number of ports where troops can land in the Dutch East Indies is very limited, so these submarines are a very effective force. The survey also stated that the destroyers and mine-laying ships of the Dutch East Indies are quite special in style and can be equipped with aircraft. As for the gasoline needed for aircraft, there is already a sufficient supply due to the construction of two major aviation gasoline plants. The Dutch East Indies has excellent equipment for both air defense and bombing attacks on warships. Its air force includes Marvel bombers, Corwin aircraft, Fokker aircraft, and German Tauni aircraft. Several excellent military bases and countless secret airfields have been completed. As for land air defense, all are equipped with Vickers anti-aircraft guns. The survey report also stated that in the early years, the Dutch East Indies government purchased a large number of aircraft from Europe for building defenses, and recently purchased more from the United States. The total number of aircraft imported into the Dutch East Indies in 1938 was 104, of which 66 were purchased from the United States. The Dutch East Indies National Assembly recently voted to purchase 250 more bombers. Before the mother country, the Netherlands, was invaded, the army of the Dutch East Indies already had 50,000 people. Since then, recruitment has continued and is in progress. In the past, the defense of the Dutch East Indies relied solely on the mother country, but in recent years it has adopted a policy of self-help and has formed a complete organization to achieve its goals. Other actions include mobilizing national economic resources and improving the national economy. All of this has put the Dutch East Indies in a strong position to resist foreign aggression.

### Singapore Defense Situation As Seen By American Journalist Group

Singapore - Eleven American journalists who visited Singapore's defenses yesterday saw four 18-inch cannons defending the strait between Singapore Island and the mainland, Johor. There are four airfields on Singapore Island, and infantry and artillery are stationed at three key points on the east coast of Singapore Island. The barbed wire along the coast of Singapore Island has been completed. Evidence of fortifications can be seen everywhere outside Singapore City. Barbed wire and gun emplacements are set up in many unexpected locations. Various precautions have been extended to all parts of the Malay Peninsula. According to the journalists, they were deeply impressed by the following situations when inspecting Singapore's defenses: (1) Indian troops, Malay troops, and British troops are concentrated on Singapore Island. (2) London has not neglected the defense of Singapore, and its fortifications are probably difficult for any enemy to break through. (3) Singapore is very easy to send land and air reinforcements to from India and Australia. (4) The officials and people here are very calm. These eleven American journalists left here by plane at 6 o'clock this morning and heard that they will go to Manila. (United Press dispatch of the 1st)

### U.S. Defense Program Makes Great Progress

New York - If a statistics is made of the progress of self-defense measures last week, it is clear that the United States is advancing rapidly towards national defense preparation. The Senate passed the Enlistment Act to mobilize men from 21 to 31 years old to engage in one year of military training. It is expected that the bill will be passed by the House of Representatives. The Senate also passed the entire National Defense Act, authorizing the use of 500 million U.S. dollars to build 18,000 aircraft, 200 warships, and completely mechanize the army of 1.2 million people. In addition to the above measures, Secretary of the Navy Knox announced that he had ordered 17,000 naval military aircraft engines from American aircraft companies. This contract is the greatest in U.S. history. At the same time, the Army Department has signed a contract entrusting the Wela Torre Aircraft Company to manufacture 687 fighter jets and motors for another 20,000 aircraft. President Roosevelt also expanded the self-defense program in the Western Hemisphere, signed an order mobilizing 395,000 national defense forces and reservists to receive one year of training. These troops will later be sent to any part of the Western Hemisphere or U.S. territories, including the Philippines. In addition, there was an important step last week, that is, the joint defense of Canada and the United States has been implemented after the meeting of representatives of the two countries.

### One Year Anniversary of the European War, Germany Reviews the War Situation, Casualties of Generals and Soldiers Total 200,000, Aircraft Losses 1,050

Berlin - On the first anniversary of the European War, the German Supreme Military Authority reviewed the war situation in the past year to the Haitong News Agency reporter and said that the result of the first year of the European War proved that the German army was superior to the enemy army. The development of the war situation further showed that the German military authorities were fully prepared. Under the command of the German leader, the German army achieved great success in a short period of time with few losses. This also depended on the German training being orderly and disciplined. In just eleven months, they conquered Poland, Norway, the Netherlands, and Belgium. After France was destroyed, it also requested surrender. The British Expeditionary Force also collapsed and fled back to Britain. In these twelve months, Germany suffered the following losses: 39,000 officers and soldiers killed, 24,000 missing, and 143,000 wounded. According to the French War of 1918, the German army lost 974,000 people in 20 days, of which 225,000 died or went missing. Although military success was achieved, it failed to break through the enemy's defense line and seize the position to attack Britain and the English Channel. Today, the German army's front line has expanded from Narvik to the Pyrenees, facing the British Isles. The German navy's glorious victory in Norway was accomplished by a small number of navies. This is a strategically unparalleled result. After the war, the German navy's commercial warfare was very effective, but Germany has not engaged in commercial warfare with all its submarines, so commercial warfare has not yet reached its peak. From the war to July 31, 1940, the German air and naval forces sank a total of 4,986,860 tons of ships, not including those sunk by mines. The German Air Force has now become Germany's independent military equipment, and has repeatedly made great achievements so far. In the future, in the war against Britain, it will definitely defeat Britain. The results of the past year have indicated that Germany is not far from the final victory. (Haitong dispatch of the 1st)

Berlin - The victory and loss of the German Air Force in the first year of the war can be proved by the following statistics: German bombers took off for 220 days, attacked 3,500 times, and dropped 5 million bombs, weighing over 75,000 tons. During this period, enemy battleships and merchant ships totaling 2 million tons were sunk, and another 700 warships and merchant ships were damaged, totaling 3.5 million tons. In one year, 1,050 German aircraft were lost. 3,100 enemy aircraft were shot down in air combat, and 3,850 were destroyed by anti-aircraft guns or on the ground, for a total of about 7,000 Allied aircraft lost. German fighters shot down 155 British protective balloons. About 400 enemy armored vehicles and tanks were destroyed by German anti-aircraft guns. Two German destroyer teams each shot down 300 enemy aircraft, 7 drivers each shot down 20 enemy aircraft, and 10 reconnaissance aircraft drivers flew over enemy countries for more than one million kilometers in one year.

London - Rome radio news said that according to an Italian military bulletin, a team of Italian aircraft bombed an enemy convoy in the eastern Mediterranean, hitting a ship and inflicting heavy damage.

The Italian bulletin also claimed that only one ship was damaged, which proves the British Navy's ability to protect. (Reuters dispatch of the 1st)

Anecdotes of the European War (1)

### Churchill's Teenage Romance

The war on the Indian border has just ended, and the situation in Egypt and Sudan is tense again. In 1885, General Gordon was killed, and the British government could no longer bear it, and decided to launch a large-scale crusade. The famous General Kitchener led 10,000 British and Egyptian troops up the Nile River. Churchill couldn't help but feel itchy, so he rushed back to London and, together with his mother, ran around to get the army authorities to allow him to join the army as a combatant. He first went to Cairo, the capital of Egypt, and then set off with the main force, trekking for two weeks, deep into the African interior for 1,400 miles, and arrived at the confluence of the Atbara River and the Nile River, which is the base of 20,000 British troops. After advancing for another nine days, they arrived at the forward base of the British army. Only eighteen miles away from Omdurman, which was occupied by the Hui native tribes.

Churchill belonged to the 21st Cavalry Regiment and served as the vanguard. On September 1, they marched directly towards Omdurman. The native army had a total of 60,000 people, with 20,000 rifles, and the rest were mostly spears. On the second day, they clashed with the British army, with 6,000 casualties and about 200 British soldiers killed. The 21st Cavalry Regiment was on the left flank, close to Omdurman. Once, Churchill and the entire team of more than 300 people charged on horseback. Because he had a problem with his arm joints, he used a pistol instead of a broadsword. He faced the enemy in close combat, and was in great danger several times. First, he was lucky that he was quick-witted and accurate with his marksmanship; second, the Arabian horse he was riding could play polo, somersaulting and leaping, and was able to turn danger into safety.

Because he fought fiercely with the enemy, he suddenly lost his way. Reading a passage from his own record, one can know how anxious he was at the time. He said: "Where is my team? I can't see a single soldier within a hundred yards. But beyond fifty yards, the enemy is waiting in full battle array. I saw two or three riflemen aiming their guns at me. That was the first time I felt fear. I felt very lonely, and only galloped for my life on the saddle. After two or three hundred yards, I found the main force, and the other three small teams were also reorganizing. Suddenly, a native burst out. I don't know how he ran over. The whole team used spears to stab him. He collided back and forth, and suffered several wounds. Suddenly, he thrust his spear straight at me. I fired at him within one yard, and he fell dead on the sand."

After the native army was defeated, our army also returned in triumph. On the way back home, Churchill once peeled off a layer of skin for a friend, which was also a commendable thing. According to himself: "I met Maleno Knox in Cairo, who was also an officer in the 21st Cavalry Regiment. His right wrist was severely cut by a knife. I decided to accompany him. One day, while we were chatting, the doctor came to bandage his wound. His deep cut urgently needed to be grafted with a piece of skin. The skinny Irish doctor looked at me and said, "I want to get a piece of skin from you." There was no way to hide at this time, so I rolled up my sleeves, and the doctor said very gently, "Have you ever heard of a living person being skinned? This is a bit like it." He cut off a piece of skin from the inner arm between my elbow and wrist, about the size of a shilling. When he slowly cut and gouged back and forth with a bayonet, my feeling was just like the taste of "living hell" he described. However, I gritted my teeth and endured everything, so this piece of skin is still on my friend's arm. As for me, I took that scar as a souvenir."

After Churchill returned to London, he gave great consideration to the income of "being a soldier." At that time, it was difficult for decent officers to maintain their uniforms and horses with their salaries. Year after year, his economic situation was getting worse and worse. If he served in the army for a few more years, wouldn't it be even worse? On the other hand, the rewards he received from his two books and the Daily Telegraph were more than five times higher than what he had earned from three years of military service, so after serving his full term in India, he jumped out of the military world.

Around 1900, South Africa was a troubled time. At that time, Johannesburg was the center of gold production. The government established by the Dutch natives was strengthening its military and raising 60,000 brave and good soldiers. A large number of military supplies were imported from the Netherlands and Germany, and its power was growing stronger and stronger. Seeing that the situation was not right, the British government also increased its military strength to prepare for emergencies. Before long, the two sides clashed.

At that time, Churchill had accepted an invitation from the London Morning Post to serve as a war correspondent and set off immediately. It took half a month to sail to Cape Town. At this time, the British army had retreated to a place 120 miles inland from the coast called Ladysmith. Churchill decided to go to Natal first to fight, and then return to the Cape of Good Hope to observe the large-scale decisive battle between the two armies. Once he had made up his mind, he took a train for 700 miles to Port Elizabeth, and then changed ships to Durban, Natal.

Churchill originally wanted to go to Ladysmith after arriving in Durban, but the railway had been interrupted. In order to find out the news, Churchill went with Captain Haldane, who was in charge of the train, to scout. The train carried two teams of infantry. The armored train advanced fourteen miles towards the enemy, and the natives suddenly appeared. So he immediately backed the car, and the rumbling of cannons had been pressed straight away. A shell flew over, only a few feet away from Churchill's head! While everyone was in chaos, the front part of the train had been ambushed and derailed.

There were six cars on the train, with the engine in the center and three cars in front and behind. The engine and the three cars at the back were not damaged, but the three cars in front were blocking the track, making it impossible for the other cars to move forward. I thought of a way to detach the engine from the rear cars and use it to clear the damaged cars.

Amidst the flying bullets, the bursting bullets, and the crackling and clashing sounds, we fought for seventy minutes, and the engine pushed, rammed, and dragged, and finally succeeded. However, there was no way to get the three cars at the back to rush past. Churchill and Captain Haldane agreed to transport more than 40 wounded and sick into the cars, and the rest walked back. At that time, artillery shells were exploding all around, and some had already concentrated on the engine. The speed of the car increased, and Haldane and his team had disappeared. Instead, he saw two plainclothes men, who turned out to be natives!

The two men kept firing and chasing after him. At a critical moment, Churchill wanted to draw his gun to fight back, but he knew that the gun in his waist had been removed after repairing the train and forgotten to take it with him. After running for some time, he was captured unarmed. This was on November 15, 1899. (To be continued)

### British Public Unanimously Hopeful for Timely Opening of the Burma Road, China's Future Seen as Benefiting Britain, British People Largely Sympathetic to China's War of Resistance, Director of the British Museum Discusses Situation in Shanghai

Mr. Brankdte, Director of the British Museum, recently arrived in Shanghai from London. Yesterday, someone visited Mr. Brankdte at his residence, and he provided a detailed account of British public opinion towards China and the actual situation in Europe. He stated that the British public deeply sympathizes with China's war of resistance. If a survey were conducted, at least nine out of ten people would express sympathy for China. The remaining one would either be ignorant of the overall situation or have close business ties with Japan.

Hope for Opening of the Burma Road

Therefore, when the British government accepted Japan's demand to block the Burma Road, the public strongly opposed it. When Mr. Brankdte left London, the general public hoped that the road would reopen as usual after the two-month period expired, as they deeply understood that China's position greatly affects Britain's interests in the Far East.

London's Situation Remains Peaceful

When asked about the recent situation in Europe, he said that it is not easy for Germany to cross the Strait and attack England, as the British Navy still controls the sea and the British Air Force holds air supremacy. Germany finds it difficult to fly over and enter. The general situation in London remains as peaceful as ever, although he heard of London being bombed during his journey.

Soon to Leave Shanghai for Chongqing

Mr. Brankdte is a renowned expert on porcelain and has extensive knowledge of Chinese antiques. He grew up in Shanghai and is very familiar with the situation in China. Before the war, he served as the Director of the National Museum. It is said that after arriving in Shanghai this time, he plans to travel to Chongqing soon. He will stay in Shanghai for a short time before departing.

### Moonlight Saving Time to End at Month's End

The city's Daylight Saving Time, which began at 0:59 on June 1 this year, has been implemented by all businesses and residents except for government agencies, courts, customs, and post offices. As the season has now entered autumn, the Daylight Saving Time movement is no longer necessary. Therefore, the Public Works Department has decided to issue a notice at the end of this month, stating that the Daylight Saving Time movement will end at 0:59 on the night of September 30. All clocks that have been moved forward will be restored to their original time from that point onwards.

### Thrift Association Urges Donations for Winter Clothing

The city's Thrift Movement Committee, in response to the fundraising campaign for winter clothing, yesterday appealed to people from all walks of life to save on unnecessary consumption and donate towards winter clothing, with the aim of achieving the predetermined goal within two months. The original text roughly stated: Frontline soldiers charge into battle, risking their lives, abandoning their families, and fighting across the battlefield, enduring hardships to save the people from suffering, resolve their crises, establish a century-long plan for the nation, and seek lasting world peace. Their hard work and merits are admired for generations. In contrast, our compatriots in Shanghai, though living on an isolated island within the concessions, indulge in wine, music, and extravagant spending. Is this comparable to those who hear no gunfire and enjoy themselves? Fortunately, Shanghai still has no shortage of patriots who dedicate their efforts to saving the nation. Although the environment is poor, it cannot hinder their patriotic enthusiasm. This is something to be grateful for. As autumn has arrived and the northern regions are experiencing early cold, the central government has launched a campaign to raise one million sets of winter clothing. Shanghai has also responded and is calling on all citizens to continue their past spirit, enthusiastically donate, and resolve this issue as soon as possible.

### French Concession: Vigilance Remains High, More Chinese Police Recruited

To maintain order and peace within the French Concession, the French Police Department dispatched patrol teams on a tour of duty the day before yesterday, and soldiers from the French garrison in Shanghai participated to assist in maintaining strict vigilance, searching residences, and cracking down on the hiding of undesirable elements. The vigilance around the General Police Station was particularly strict, as noted in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that patrols were still being conducted in various locations yesterday. It is also heard that the Police Superintendent, concerned that the original number of police officers was insufficient due to vacancies, and fearing that there would be a shortage of personnel in the event of an emergency, has been recruiting Chinese police officers in recent days to fill the gaps. The applicants are being selected and tested at the Songshan Road Police Station, and the number of applicants is quite large.

### Japanese Warship Shells Zhenhai

The Shanghai-based Zhejiang Provincial Associations received the following telegram yesterday: (1) At 6:25 AM on the 31st, two Japanese warships sailed from the north into the waters off Zhenhai and docked in the waters off Ligang. At 6:45 AM, the two Japanese warships sailed eastward. (2) A Japanese warship outside Zhenhai opened fire suddenly at 1:20 PM on the 31st, firing six shells. One shell landed on the Zhenhai Drum Tower, destroying a house. One shell landed at the Panjia place in Panjia, destroying a house. One shell landed at the home of Wang Afeng in Dahetou but did not explode. One shell landed at the Hu family in Xihetang and did not explode. A shell landed at [illegible], destroying a house. A shell landed at [illegible], destroying half a house. There were no other losses. (3) At 1:40 PM on the 31st, three Japanese warships sailed from the north into the waters off Zhenhai and docked in the waters off Ligang, bringing the total to four. There were no changes as of last night.

### Anniversary of the September 18th Incident Approaching, Promoting Fundraising for Winter Clothing, Concession Authorities Maintain Joint Vigilance

The ninth anniversary of the "September 18th" Incident is approaching. The people of Shanghai view this day as the date when the Japanese army forcibly invaded our four northeastern provinces. At this time when the nation's belief is firm, commemorating this painful day is particularly meaningful. However, given the special circumstances in Shanghai, it has been decided to stop lavish displays and follow last year's precedent, as well as abide by the central government's intentions, by voluntarily suspending entertainment and banquets. As the National Winter Clothing Fundraising Committee is currently launching a campaign to raise funds for winter clothing, it has been decided to actively promote winter clothing donations around this anniversary in order to collect and submit them.

Joint Vigilance by Concession Authorities

As the anniversary of the "September 18th" Incident approaches, and given the tense situation in Europe and the constant occurrence of terrorist incidents recently, the police authorities of the two concessions have intensified their usual vigilance and patrols to maintain order within the concessions and ensure public safety. They have decided to continue to adopt joint vigilance measures, prohibiting unauthorized gatherings, associations, and processions starting from the 13th, and strictly enforcing curfew laws. Emergency measures will be implemented starting on the 6th. At that time, the defense forces of the United States, France, and Italy, as well as the International Settlement Volunteers and police personnel, will all be mobilized for security. The non-essential roads, lanes, and bridges at the intersection of the two concessions will be blocked, following the precedents of "July 7th" and "August 13th."

### Shanghai Journalists Commemorate Journalists' Day, Distribute Winter Clothing Funds to Support Soldiers, and Send Telegram to All Sectors in Chongqing to Express Respect

Yesterday was the seventh "September 1st" Chinese Journalists' Day. The Shanghai journalistic community commemorated the day solemnly due to the environment, replacing ceremonies with spiritual encouragement. At 12:00 noon, journalists stood up in their respective positions and observed three minutes of silence to mourn the journalists who sacrificed themselves after the Battle of Shanghai to support the national policy of resistance and reconstruction. In addition to stepping up the fundraising for winter clothing to meet the needs of frontline soldiers, so that the great cause of resistance and reconstruction can be completed as soon as possible, the journalists sent a telegram to all sectors in Chongqing to express their respect for the fact that the people of the capital have shown even greater resilience despite being indiscriminately bombed by Japanese aircraft.

### Amidst Autumn Tides and Torrential Rain, Another Hurricane Warning Received, Customs Hoists Warning Ball Yesterday Afternoon, Heavy Rain Last Night, High Tides Starting Today

According to a report from the observatory received by the Customs the day before yesterday, a hurricane had reached Fuzhou Bay and was advancing towards Dachen Yang, threatening Shanghai. This was reported in yesterday's newspaper. At 6:00 AM yesterday, the Xujiahui Observatory reported that the hurricane that struck Fuzhou had landed at Sandu'ao, northwest of Fuzhou, after passing east of Fuzhou. By yesterday morning, it had reached 27 degrees north latitude and 119 degrees east longitude. The center of the wind force was within 60 nautical miles, and the wind force had weakened. According to the reported location, the hurricane had entered Jian'ou near northern Fujian after landing and would enter Jiangxi, where it would dissipate. The threat of the hurricane to Shanghai was lifted. The Jianghai Customs removed the black ball from the roof and Yangshupu signal tower at around 9:00 AM yesterday, and shipping resumed inbound and outbound traffic.

Another Warning Received Yesterday Afternoon

Unexpectedly, at 3:00 PM yesterday, another report was received from the observatory that the hurricane had resurfaced towards Shanghai and had reached the waters off Wenzhou. The Customs then hoisted a black ball again on the flagpole on the roof of the clock tower, and ships on the Huangpu River took extra precautions. Inbound and outbound ships yesterday were mostly those sailing on the Yangtze River and the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, such as Chongsha. Only a small number of ships operated as usual, while all ocean-going ships to Shanghai were absent. The Taikoo Haikou and Jardine Matheson Fusheng and other vessels scheduled to depart yesterday remained anchored, waiting for the hurricane to pass before departing.

Ocean Liner Schedules Difficult to Predict

It is said that the schedule of the American President Lines' President Pierce was not affected by the hurricane and it was still scheduled to arrive in Shanghai this morning. It is uncertain whether the Java China Japan Lijn's Tjitjalengka will be able to arrive on time this morning due to its slightly smaller size. It is also uncertain whether the Taikoo Company's Taiyuan and Qiongzhou will be able to arrive in Shanghai today.

Another Hurricane Rapidly Approaching from the Northwest

According to the observatory, a new hurricane in the Pacific Ocean had reached 17 degrees north latitude and 137 degrees east longitude at 6:00 AM yesterday, heading northwest. It is still far from Shanghai, but if it continues to follow this course, Shanghai will again be threatened. Furthermore, the Huangpu River will experience high tides again starting today (2nd), with levels around 12 feet.

Tidal Floods in Huangpu River Starting Today

According to the Huangpu Conservancy Bureau's prediction, the Huangpu River will experience high tides again starting today, with predicted levels all around 12 feet.

The high tide at 2:10 AM on the 5th was measured at 11 feet 5 inches, and the high tide at 2:37 PM was measured at 10 feet 2.4 inches. The high tide at 3:02 AM on the 6th was measured at 11 feet 4 inches, and at 3:16 PM it was 11 feet 1.5 inches.

### French Consul General in Shanghai, Eugene, to be Promoted, No Definite News on Departure, Vacancy to be Filled by Mr. Magre

The North China Daily News reports that Eugene, the French Consul General in Shanghai, will soon leave Shanghai to take up a new post elsewhere. Eugene came to Shanghai more than three years ago. In May of this year, the former French Consul General in Shanghai, Baudic, left Shanghai due to illness, and Eugene succeeded him. When questioned by reporters, Eugene replied that he could not say for certain when he would leave or where he would be transferred, as various procedures were still in progress and there was no definite news. However, according to reporters, Eugene's vacancy will be filled by Mr. Magre, the first secretary of the French Embassy in London. Mr. Magre departed for Shanghai with his wife and two children in early August to take up his new post. Mr. Magre has served in the French Embassy in London for two years and is capable and promising. Mrs. Magre is also well-regarded in London social circles.

### Some French Nationals in Shanghai Support Continued War of Resistance, Grieved by the Fall of Their Homeland, Feel Mental and Physical Pain, Generating Great Strength to Achieve Liberation

The Continental Daily News reports that the French Pétain government has humiliatingly surrendered to [illegible]. General Charles de Gaulle of France immediately established the French National Committee in London, calling on French patriots to cooperate with Britain to continue the war against Germany in order to seek France's freedom, and adopted the "Lorraine Cross" of the French heroine Joan of Arc as its official emblem. Today, several shops in Shanghai are also selling Lorraine Cross badges, which are made in the style of lapel pins with the motto "France Unbowed" engraved on them. Many French nationals in Shanghai are purchasing these badges and wearing them on their lapels to show their adherence to the Allied cause. A spokesperson for these French nationals gave a speech last Friday, expressing the opinions and ideas of his comrades, which can represent the views of French people around the world who support continued resistance.

Continue to Strive for Freedom

The spokesperson first mentioned the recent speech by British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, saying that only from the brave words and determination of the British Prime Minister and people to continue the struggle until final victory can the French people hope to restore their independence and territorial integrity. The pain suffered by France in both body and mind has only just begun.

French People in Dire Straits

France is currently on the verge of chaos. Two-thirds of the people are under the control of the enemy authorities and are driven at will, while the remaining one-third is also subject to the invaders and controlled by them. Traffic between the occupied and unoccupied zones is blocked at the enemy's whim. The Vichy government is obstructed by the enemy and cannot take action in the occupied zone, and key positions have already been occupied by Germans.

French and German Aspirations Incompatible

In addition, various parts of France have experienced famine. All of these situations are in the hands of the enemy and there is no possibility of improvement, nor can one hope that the enemy will have pity or sympathy. The sole desire of Germany is to destroy France and divide its colonies, while the sole hope of France is to regain its independence.

Awaken Compatriots to Unite and Rise Up

Many French people have now risen up to support Britain. Millions of French people residing in the colonies and overseas recognize that seeking France's freedom is their sacred goal. [Illegible] has already been generated. In order to remain unbowed, France urgently needs all its sons and daughters to provide immediate and effective assistance. All French people who are worthy of the name know that it is necessary to join the movement to protect and obtain national freedom. All those who participate in this movement will be able to hold their heads high on the day France is finally liberated.

### Catholic Faithful Commemorate Lebbe, Establish Lebbe Business Proposal Association, Divided into Education, Charity, Agriculture, and Industry Departments

Since the death of Father Vincent Lebbe in Chongqing on June 24, Chinese and foreign Catholic faithful have mourned in unison. To commemorate Father Lebbe's lifelong career, the Lebbe Business Development Committee has been organized. Recently, the committee issued a circular to solicit funds. Details are as follows:

Compassionate Heart, Dedicated Service Circular states: Father Vincent Lebbe, originally from Belgium, passed away at the age of sixty-four. He was ordered to come to our country to preach, which lasted exactly forty years. He was naturalized as a Chinese citizen in 1927. His charitable heart, compassion, and dedicated service, as well as his righteous and indomitable will, remained unchanged for forty years, constantly increasing, and unwavering. His great achievements in serving the Party and the nation and his effective service to society are too numerous to mention and are clearly visible. He also funded Chinese students studying abroad to enhance their achievements and went deep into the people to relieve suffering. Therefore, the people regarded him as a savior, and the faithful looked up to him as a divine philosopher.

Deep Mourning Upon Hearing the Sad News

Unfortunately, on March 9 of this year, Father Lebbe traveled south from southern Hebei and was detained in Lin County, Henan for forty days. Due to excessive stimulation, he became ill again. After escaping danger on April 17 and going to Luoyang, his physical strength was weak and unsustainable, and his condition worsened. He was then flown to Chongqing for treatment, but his illness was terminal and medicine was ineffective. He passed away at 9:00 PM on June 24. The news of his death caused unanimous grief at home and abroad.

Great Career Yet to be Completed

Considering that Father Lebbe's mission of resistance and reconstruction has not been completed and that his great social career has not yet been accomplished, we intend to emulate and promote his spirit of dedicated service and complete and expand his ambitious career. Therefore, it is proposed to establish the "Lebbe Business Development Committee" to mobilize a vast force with an organized collective to continue his spirit and manage his career. Please send replies to Father Niu Ruowang at the Yishibao office in Chongqing.

Business Fund

The Lebbe Business Development Committee is a collection of people from all walks of life who sympathize with Father Lebbe's career. It adheres to his spirit and style of serving the country and the Catholic Church and concentrates its efforts to complete his unfinished career and expand it. The business fund is tentatively set at one million yuan, part of which will be allocated by the government and part of which will be raised through donations. The previous fund will be managed by the Fund Management Committee, and the management methods will be formulated separately.

Business Types

Divided into schools, libraries, hospitals, relief centers, cultural undertakings, and agricultural and industrial enterprises. The initial expenses for each of the foregoing enterprises will be raised at one time when raising funds. As for expenses, there are two types: business expenses and operating expenses, both of which will be covered by interest from the fund. The names of the business units will all be prefixed with "Lebbe," and lectures will be given regularly on Father Lebbe's deeds to warn and inspire deep emulation.

The association has scheduled to complete the customs clearance procedures starting on Monday (today) and has sent letters urging the commissioned subscribers to pay the balance. Regarding the potential problem of the Saigon foreign rice shipment to Shanghai due to the blockade of Shanghai, the person in charge of the People's Food Regulation Association said yesterday that the association entrusted the Banque de l'Indochine to handle the ordering of foreign rice and has not received any notification from the bank that there have been any obstacles to ordering rice, so there should be no problems. The association's 23rd batch of foreign rice is still being ordered as usual.

### Robbery of Rice Leads to Punishment

At 4:15 PM on August 30th, a rice shop employee named Xu Huihan was transporting two bags of rice on a handcart to a customer. While passing near the intersection of Xinzha Road and Gordon Road, dozens of Jiangbei male and female impoverished people spotted him. Disregarding the law, they swarmed forward, slashed open the rice bags with knives, and stole approximately fifty pounds of rice before scattering in different directions. As a result, the Chinese and Western police officers apprehended a Jiangbei woman named Zhou Ma, along with six pounds of the stolen white rice. Both were taken to the Gordon Road Police Station for detention and then transferred to the Third Criminal Court of the Special District Court.

### Sugar Merchant Abandons Mistress; Mistress Petitions for Alimony; Court Mediation Fails, Leading to Legal Battle

Zhang Zuowang, the owner of Heyuan Sugar Shop at 19 Fujian Road in the French Concession, encountered a Suzhou woman named Xi Meimei (24 years old this year) five years ago. Attracted to her beauty and charm, Zhang claimed to Xi that his wife had passed away and that he had no one to help him, and asked to enter into a lifetime commitment. Xi, being only nineteen years old and simple-minded, agreed to cohabitate with Zhang as lovers, living together like a married couple.

Zhang provided Xi with a monthly allowance of approximately 200 yuan. Xi was deeply grateful to have a companion for life. She became pregnant and gave birth to a daughter at Guangci Hospital in January of this year. Zhang was overjoyed at the birth of Xi's daughter. However, in May of this year, a person named Li came to the residence where Zhang and Xi were living together and stated, "Your affair with Mr. Zhang has been discovered by Mr. Zhang's wife. If you do not separate from Mr. Zhang, there may be unfavorable consequences. Matters of money can be discussed." Xi suspected that something was wrong because Zhang had been away from home for several days without returning. Therefore, she was dubious of Li's words.

After inquiring everywhere, Xi confirmed that it was indeed the case. Xi was overcome with grief and anger. Zhang also asked a friend to seek Xi's understanding. Later, lawyer Yu Bingwen came forward on behalf of Zhang to negotiate a settlement, offering 2,000 yuan as a separation fee. The daughter born from the relationship would have no connection to Zhang. As for Xi's current pregnancy, regardless of whether she gives birth to a son or daughter, it would also have no connection to Zhang. If Xi agreed to these terms, she could go to Yu's law firm to sign the agreement. Xi originally wanted to grow old with Zhang, but Zhang

had abandoned her after getting involved. Therefore, Xi had no choice but to commission lawyer Mao Xianshen to file a petition with the Second Special Court for Civil Mediation, requesting that Zhang Zuowang be summoned to court and ordered to pay monthly living expenses (for Xi and her daughter Zhang Bao Bao) of 300 yuan. The court accepted the case. The other day, Judge Yang conducted a mediation hearing in the Fifth Court. Zhang Zuowang himself did not appear but appointed lawyer Li Baomei to appear on his behalf, stating that he did not agree to Xi Meimei's request. The plaintiff Xi's agent lawyer Mao Xianshen stated the circumstances of Zhang Zuowang's abandonment, stating that he should be responsible for the support of the plaintiff and her daughter. Since Zhang Zuowang did not agree to mediation, the court announced that the mediation was unsuccessful. The plaintiff Zhang Xi can formally file a lawsuit and then left the court.

### Renji Hospital Report - July

According to Renji Hospital's July report: 17,980 outpatient visits, 569 hospitalized patients, 8,645 days of inpatient stay, 38 male suicides, 35 female suicides, 162 surgical operations on inpatients, 160 surgical operations on outpatients, 27 factory accidents and injuries, 340 patients sent by the Public Concession Police, 40 patients sent by the French Concession Police, 53 deliveries, 724 X-ray examinations, 18,549 prescriptions dispensed. Overall, the above figures show that the hospital's workload has increased significantly compared to the previous month, especially in the outpatient department, which is consistent with last year's experience. The increase is due to the prevalence of summer diseases such as dysentery and enteritis. It is not yet certain whether these diseases are due to eating too much watermelon. Factory accidents and injuries have decreased by one-third, which may indicate a decrease in factory work.

### Letter to the Editor

To the Editor,

With all due respect, I am writing in response to an article in the Local News section of your newspaper on the 29th of this month, which stated that Yuan Renjie's foster son had been taken away by a woman and that the child was allegedly the child of Yuan and the woman, etc. This does not correspond to the facts. After the outbreak of the August 13th Shanghai Battle, Renjie was in Shanghai handling relief work. Due to the poor health of his family and his own important work, he had no choice but to temporarily entrust his young son, Tianrong, to Xu Zhang in October of that year. It was agreed that a subsidy of six yuan would be paid monthly, and payments were made in advance and never delayed. In June of this year, Xu moved back to her hometown in Zhabei Zhongshan Road, so she took her son Tianrong back to care for him herself. Unexpectedly, on the 5th of this month, Xu came to visit again. Because the child had been fostered at Xu's place for three years, he was very fond of her and insisted on going with her. Therefore, Xu claimed that she would take him to play for two or three days and then bring him back. Who knew that it has been over three weeks since she left and her whereabouts are unknown. While we were worrying, at 10:30 AM on the 26th of this month, Xu came to my residence with tears in her eyes and stated, "Tianrong was planning to be sent back earlier, but her son Xu Genfa now holds a position in the Zhabei Self-Defense Corps and monitors them every day, not allowing them to be sent back. He said that if Renjie wants to redeem the child, he must first pay 500 yuan. Otherwise, they would not only harm Tianrong to death but also drag Renjie to the Zhabei Self-Defense Corps and kill him. If she secretly sends the child out, she will also be killed," etc. When I heard this terrible news, I agreed to her request for the sake of ensuring the child's safety. I asked her to tell Xu Genfa to come to my residence this Saturday to discuss the collection of the money and prepared to report the case to the police. Unexpectedly, at 1:40 PM that afternoon, Xu Genfa gathered a number of thugs and came to my

residence and claimed, "We want to go to the Zhabei Self-Defense Corps to talk about the payment and showed a card from a certain Zhang, the head of the so-called Self-Defense Corps, saying, "Nowadays, killing a 'Ba Zi' (meaning "someone from outside of Shanghai") is nothing strange. If you don't go, we'll drag you away with a Japanese truck," etc. Therefore, I had no choice but to report the case to the police for legal action. Now the woman has avoided meeting us, and the child has been hidden by the thugs. We are still investigating. In short, everything will become clear in the future. After reading the report in your newspaper, there are many discrepancies with the facts. I am afraid that there has been inaccurate reporting, which will damage the reputations of several people. Therefore, I am sending this letter to request a correction. Yours sincerely, Yuan Renjie, August 30th

### Civil Education Centers Should Guide Local Social Education

(Chongqing, 1st - Electric Telegram) The Ministry of Education recently issued an order to the education departments and bureaus of all provinces and cities, instructing the public education centers of all counties to not only manage their own various undertakings but also to take responsibility for guiding the adult classes, women's classes, and various social education undertakings of schools within their respective educational districts. They should also operate in accordance with the "Outline of Measures for Public Education Centers to Guide Local Social Education" previously issued by the ministry.

### Children Under Twelve Years of Age Not Allowed to Undergo Military Training; Do Not Need to Participate in Irrelevant Gatherings

(Lishui Correspondence) The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education recently received an order from the Ministry of Education, stating that it has been reported that there are many gatherings in various places recently. Regardless of the severe cold or heat, primary school students as young as six or seven years old are required to participate, often standing in the wind and sun for two or three hours. The children do not understand what is being said on stage, and those with weaker physiques often become ill as a result. It can be said that it does more harm than good. It has also been reported that there are primary school children undergoing military training, or having their legs bound and their waists constricted, restricting their muscles, or undergoing excessive labor, exhausting their bodies, which is harmful to their development and violates regulations. Assemblies for adults have nothing to do with children, and military training is not suitable for primary school children. The department should forward the order to its subordinate primary schools that children under the age of twelve should not participate in gatherings that have nothing to do with children, and should not undergo military training, in order to protect the health of children. It has already forwarded the order to its subordinates for compliance.

### Dongya Sports College Establishes Branch in Guizhou Province

Before the war, there were two sports colleges in this city, one being Shanghai Sports College and the other being Dongya Sports College. After the outbreak of the war, the city sports college was not restored, while Dongya Sports College moved into the Chinese Vocational Education Society in the French Concession and continued to operate, making it the only remaining institution for training sports teachers in China. Chen Mengyu, the principal of Dongya, has been striving for progress. In addition to Yu Jinxiang, Tong Zhongyi, Qian Hangsu, and other famous figures in the sports world continuing to serve as faculty, Yang Yongcan, the former director of the sports department of Daxia University, and Ms. Lin Yunsheng, a former professor at Central University, have also been hired to teach sports theory and practical skills. Furthermore, in view of the fact that the country's need for sports talent is outstripping supply, a branch has been established in Pingyue, Guizhou, which has been approved by the Ministry of Education and has begun enrolling students.

### All-Shanghai Open Swimming Competition: Two Backstroke Records Broken; Lun Siding Wins Men's 150-Yard Backstroke; Pi Qu Wins Women's 50-Yard – Huang Zhaolun Champion in Men's 440-Yard Freestyle –

Shanghai swimming has returned to its peak era of 1935 and 1936, and the Chinese have also made significant progress. In this year's All-Shanghai Open Swimming Competition, the records have been broken by Lun Siding in the 150-yard backstroke and Miss Man Tai Moore in the women's 100-yard freestyle. At the third race held last night at the Rowing Club, two more backstroke records were broken by men and women, which is gratifying. Backstroke is the most difficult event in swimming, and progress is very difficult. In this year's All-Shanghai backstroke events, all records have been broken, which is a great event. For example, the old record for the women's 50-yard backstroke was 38 seconds flat, set back in 1930 by Miss Schmidt. No one has been able to break it in the last ten years. Now Miss Pi Qu has shortened it by 1 and 1/5 seconds with an excellent score of 36 and 4/5 seconds, which is very rare. Miss Lin Meiling came in second. Although there is no official record, it is estimated that it is also in the new record, because Miss Lin is only less than half a body behind Miss Pi Qu. The record breaker in the men's 100-yard backstroke is the eccentric Lun Siding. He has already set a new record in the 150-yard backstroke in this competition and won the 880-yard freestyle championship with a backstroke posture for two-thirds of the distance. Last night, his score was 65 and 4/5 seconds, breaking his highest Shanghai 100-yard backstroke record of 66 and 1/5 seconds held last year. He also used his remaining energy to participate in the 440-yard freestyle and won second place. Chinese star Huang Zhaolun won the championship in the 440-yard with an extremely fast start and sprint, and his mid-course pacing was very even. Veteran Lu Gen once competed fiercely with Huang, but ended up in last place. Lu Gen has been the Shanghai champion in the last three or four years, and Huang is proud to have defeated him. Huang's score was 5 minutes and 57.1 seconds, which is not far from the highest record. Chinese general Wang Zhongren competed fiercely with Smith in the 100-yard backstroke, and the result was tied for second place. No Chinese generals participated in the junior 220-yard freestyle, and the result was the Pantot championship. The results are as follows:

Men's 100-Yard Backstroke (1) Lun Siding,

(2) Wang Zhongren Smith 65 and 4/5 seconds (New Record)

Junior 220-Yard Freestyle (1) Pantot, (2) Stephens, 2 minutes and 51 seconds flat

Women's 50-Yard Backstroke (1) Miss Pi Qu, (2) Miss Lin Meiling, (3) Miss Li Qi, 36 and 4/5 seconds (New Record)

Men's 440-Yard Freestyle (1) Huang Zhaolun, (2) Lun Siding, (3) Lu Gen, 5 minutes and 57 and 1/5 seconds

### Sino-American Tennis Final Postponed Due to Rain; Hezhong Cup Rescheduled to Close on Wednesday

Yesterday, there was drizzling rain all day, and in the evening it poured like a torrent, causing outdoor sports such as the Hezhong Cup, Guangshi Cup basketball, amateur volleyball, and the Sino-American final of the Lobb Cup tennis to be stopped. The final scene of the Hezhong Cup, the Paramount's rematch of the Shanghai-Qingdao event, has been decided to be postponed to this Wednesday (the 4th). Because there is a Sichuan Federation Charity Basketball match on Sunday, it could not be held at the end of the week.

### A New Philosophy for Maintaining the Market: The Dying Embers of the Rice Market

These days, if you want to raise prices, you don't have to worry about finding excuses. For rice, there are even more reasons. If you lose the excuse of foreign exchange, you can borrow the news of tight coastal defense. This is an unprecedented reason.

Coastal defense has been tight for two months. There was a time when the rumors were even tighter than this, so we have been enjoying two months of benefit!

Imported rice has been assessed at a new high price, and the market price immediately follows the new limit price. The effect is seamless! Will "sanctions" be next, or will there be another "extension"?

Merchants often have these thoughts: "Business is especially good when prices rise; if prices don't rise, no one buys; if prices fall, business is dead!" This is "a new philosophy for maintaining the market."

In recent months, rice prices have been weak, and the new rice is about to arrive. A collapse is just around the corner. What we hear today, that "rice merchants are losing money," is actually setting the stage for the future. A rise today and a fall tomorrow will even things out. Otherwise, that would really be "losing money!" This is a further application of "a new philosophy for maintaining the market." So, to put it bluntly: today's rise in rice prices is just the dying embers of the rice market!

The most powerful protest that consumers have now is: "Buy rice today, eat rice today!" This strategy can be applied to other price increases! Then you won't have to worry about them not abandoning this philosophy!

### Analysis of China's Wartime National Expenditure

— Zhang Yifan

Before the war, I often delved into the study of China's wartime finance and war expenditure issues, and wrote articles for the Oriental Magazine, the previous Aomen Economic Review, and the previous Nanjing China Economy, among other magazines. Since the start of the war, I have continued to avidly collect materials related to this topic. However, as a commoner and having never left Shanghai in recent years, I only have an interest in this topic and dare not engage in research, let alone write about it. On July 16th of this year, a classmate at Jiaotong University asked me to speak on this topic, so I slightly整理, and researched it with the students of the school. Now, because students from several other schools also want me to speak on this topic, I declined due to my circumstances; however, this made me realize that I am not the only one who cares about this. Therefore, I am excerpting and publishing a portion of my lecture at Jiaotong University. I hope that domestic scholars will provide their guidance.

The First Suspect

Since the start of the war in July of the 26th year, the legal tender has increased by 2.5 billion yuan. People are saying, "This is inflation!"

Indeed, on the one hand, the war is destroying the country's original sources of revenue. For example, the Customs, Salt, and Unified Taxes, which were the three pillars of the country's revenue, have been reduced to less than 30% of what they were before. On the other hand, the war has increased national expenditure. The first major burden on the national treasury is war expenditure; the second major burden is construction expenditure to support the war. The demands of war expenditure are urgent; to ensure the completion of the war effort, construction expenditure cannot be stinted. In today's wartime environment of skyrocketing prices, the magnitude of these burdens is to be expected. Therefore, the national treasury has become the first suspect in prompting the increase in the issuance of legal tender. However, what is the truth? We will not see the truth without further studying the reality of China's wartime financial revenue and expenditure.

### The Japanese Estimate of China's War Expenditure

The greatest burden on the national treasury during wartime is war expenditure. How much has been spent on war expenses since the start of the war? A friend who teaches at Guangxi University mentioned his estimate at a meeting earlier this year, saying that the current monthly need is between 150 million and 200 million yuan; therefore, the annual need is more than 2 billion yuan; from the beginning of the war to the end of the 28th year of the Republic, a large amount of about 5 billion yuan has already been spent (Note).

The other side is paying even more attention to our country's war expenses. Their purpose, of course, carries a political effect, especially to destroy the credibility of our legal tender. For example, Kaoru Imura stated in the "Toyo" monthly magazine published on October 1st of last year: China has spent more than 5.6 billion yuan on war expenses in the two years since the start of the resistance war. This expense was made up for by the 1.2 billion yuan of legal tender issued at the time, 2.4 billion in public bonds, and the use of 1.9 billion yuan in hard currency. He said, "According to a telegram from Chongqing: China's national budget for the 28th year of the Republic is 2.8 billion yuan. Wouldn't two years be 5.6 billion yuan?" It can be seen that his estimate is to double this 2.8 billion yuan, and then piece together the amount of legal tender issued at the time and the number of public bonds; the insufficient amount is referred to as the portion of legal tender reserve funds used. However, a Chongqing telegram published in Shanghai newspapers in the autumn of the 28th year of the Republic stated: The total amount of national annual expenditure in Chongqing in the last four years (yuan)

Budget for the 25th year of the Republic 1,200,000,000

Budget for the 26th year of the Republic 2,100,000,000

Budget for the 27th year of the Republic 2,400,000,000

Budget for the 28th year of the Republic 2,850,000,000

Our country's fiscal accounting year originally ran from July 1st of this year to the end of June of the following year as one year. If the above table is calculated using this annual period, then for the three full years from the start of the war to the end of June of the 29th year of the Republic, the total amount of national annual expenditure, including war expenses, administrative expenses, debt expenses, and construction expenses, is 7.35 billion yuan; the average annual amount is only 2.45 billion yuan; the monthly amount is only 100 million yuan, which is roughly the same as Qian's estimate.

However, since the 27th year of the Republic, our country's fiscal year has been changed to a calendar year system, that is, from the New Year's Day of this year to the end of this year as one year. If the above telegram is calculated using this new annual system, then in the two and a half years from the start of the war in July of the 26th year of the Republic to the end of the 28th year of the Republic, the country spent a total of 6.855 billion yuan, with an average annual amount of more than 2.7 billion yuan, because the expenditure in the first half of the year should be deducted from the final accounts of the 26th year of the Republic. Assuming that this expenditure amount is equal to half of the old system's total national budget of 990 million yuan for the 25th year of the Republic and deducting it, then it is also smaller than Qian Cunxun's estimate.

(Note) See the "Report on the Recent Situation of Legal Tender" by Mr. Qian Jiaju in the first issue of the third volume of the Guangxi Construction Research Monthly.

### Estimates Regarding China's War Expense Expenditures

To estimate our country's war expenses, the first thing we should do is stipulate the development of our country's military strength; the second is to distinguish the composition of its military branches; the third is to distinguish between different lifestyles such as combat and defense, rest, and training; and the fourth is to distinguish between the portions directly paid by the national treasury and the portions paid by local agents of the national treasury, and so on. Because the military strength at each period is different, the equipment and combat methods of various soldiers are different, and the expenses of each unit during combat time and non-combat time are absolutely different, therefore, the estimation of our country's war expenses cannot be generalized.

According to the equipment, organization, combat methods, living habits, etc. of various soldiers in our country: the war expenses of regular troops and the war expenses of local troops and mobile troops have at least a five-to-one difference. Among the reserve troops, there are also differences between formally organized units and informally organized units. The former is equal to one-fifth of the war expenses of local troops and mobile troops; the latter's expenses are insignificant. Therefore, five divisions of local troops or mobile troops, or 25 divisions of reserve troops (referring to formally organized units, same below), are each equal to one division of regular troops. We can then, based on various relatively reliable materials regarding our country's military strength in each period, first convert them all into the number of regular troops according to the above ratio; as in the following table:

(1) According to Generals He and Bai, the total military strength at the beginning of the war was 2 million; and according to General Chen, the military strength at the beginning of the war was no more than 1 million; this generally refers to regular troops. Therefore, in addition to this, it is assumed that 1 million people are local troops, with mobile troops accounting for 500,000, and reserve troops also accounting for 500,000; when all are converted into regular troops: then a total of 1.12 million people are obtained (this material: based on the commemorative thesis on the third anniversary of the War of Resistance Against Japan by General He Yingqin, Minister of Military Administration, and General Bai Chongxi, Director of Military Training, on July 7th of the 29th year of the Republic, and by General Chen Cheng (Vice Minister of Military Administration (stated in the thesis on New Year's Day of the 29th year of the Republic). The following use of He, Bai, and Chen's materials all refers to this text).

(2) According to Hasha's estimate: from the start of the war to the end of the 27th year of the Republic, the total military strength mobilized by China was 4.5 million, including 2 million regular troops, 500,000 mobile troops, 700,000 reserve troops, and 1.3 million local troops. Among them, 1.5 million were casualties. Therefore, the total military strength at the end of the 27th year of the Republic was 3 million. According to this calculation, at that time, regular troops accounted for 1.33 million, local troops and mobile troops together accounted for 1.2 million, and reserve troops accounted for 470,000. Converted into regular troops, a total of 1.59 million people are obtained (see Hasha's "The Chinese Army" published in the English Asia magazine at the beginning of the 28th year of the Republic).

(3) Chen Cheng, Deputy Minister of Military Administration, declared on New Year's Day of the 29th year of the Republic: China's total military strength at that time was 2.5 million. Considering the previous and subsequent materials used now: this roughly does not include the number of reserve troops. Let us take this as a standard, and then calculate according to the aforementioned proportions and development rates of various soldiers: at that time, there were 1.5 million regular troops, 1 million local troops and mobile troops, and 1 million reserve troops. When all are converted into regular troops, a total of 1.74 million are obtained.

(4) According to Chairman Chiang's writing to all the soldiers and in memory of the late General Zhang Zizhong, commander of a certain group who died for his country, on July 6th of the 29th year of the Republic, there was a phrase "Our 3 million soldiers," and the next day General He Yingqin declared in his article "Our country's current total military strength is 5 million," it can be seen that the former did not include reserve troops. Re-estimating based on the above materials, at this time regular troops accounted for 1.7 million, local troops and mobile troops accounted for 1.3 million, and reserve troops had reached 2 million. When all are converted into regular troops, a total of 3.04 million people are obtained.

During the August 13th Battle of Shanghai, according to estimates from various parties: at that time, our side's average daily war expense was no more than 5 million yuan, and the monthly expense was no more than 150 million yuan. At that time, the 1 million combat troops cost no more than 150 yuan per person per month. In the past three years, prices have indeed risen sharply, but most of them have been affected by the black market exchange rate. The government directly pays in hard currency for overseas purchases or uses local products to offset them; there is no such impact. In addition, the use of stored goods and the ordering of goods from domestic designated factories are all based on the original prices, so the impact of domestic prices is also less. Let us assume that each period increases by 20 percent compared to the beginning of the war, then before the end of that year, the war expense per person per month was 150 yuan, 180 yuan in the 27th year of the Republic, 210 yuan in the 28th year of the Republic, and 240 yuan in the 29th year of the Republic.

Each soldier does not fight every day. According to the situation of the German army in the last European war, the average combat time per person per year accounted for no more than seven-tenths. In the state where the enemy's military strength is poor and they lose sight of one thing while attending to another, the combat rate of our army is naturally lower. Assuming that the combat level of soldiers during the Battle of Shanghai was as tense as that of the German army in the last European war, accounting for seven-tenths, then the greater the battle line, the lower the ratio will decrease. Assume that it decreases to six-tenths in the 27th year of the Republic, five and a half tenths in the 28th year of the Republic, and five-tenths in the 29th year of the Republic. The expenses for non-combat time, that is, defense, rest, or training time, are roughly less than one-tenth of the combat time, let us calculate with one-tenth, then we can multiply the number of soldiers in each period to obtain the total amount of war expense expenditure in our country since the start of the war (unit: 10,000 yuan of national currency)

This is the entirety of war expense expenditures, and it is still necessary to distinguish between the two types of expenditures directly from the national treasury and expenditures from local agents of the national treasury. The expenditures paid by local agents of the national treasury in peacetime account for about 5% of the total. This should be doubled in wartime. Then, of the total war expenses of 5.5476 billion yuan from the start of the war to the end of the 28th year of the Republic, no more than 5 billion yuan was directly paid by the national treasury. Calculating to the end of the 29th year of the Republic, it is no more than about 8 billion.

Assuming that the use of hard currency or foreign exchange to purchase military supplies from overseas accounts for one-third of this, then by the end of the 28th year of the Republic, a total of 1.8492 billion yuan had been spent. Calculating to the end of the 29th year of the Republic, a total of 2.91752 billion yuan is needed. Among them, the national treasury directly paid 1.7 billion to 2.7 billion yuan.

Other Non-War Expenses and Asset-Based Expenditures

In addition, there are general administrative expenses, debt expenses, and various construction expenses. Taking the pre-war period as an example: among them, debt expenses were the largest. Like in the 26th year of the Republic, the debt expenses item reached a little less than 325 million yuan, accounting for 32.5% of the total annual expenditure, but although domestic debt is always paid: foreign debt, from the 28th year of the Republic, has been changed to the new method of amortizing according to the reserved fund portion, this method has long been applied to railway debts. But before that, all were paid without error, like the customs-guaranteed debt funds, although they had been seized long ago, the Ministry of Finance still tried to pay them in advance, by the end of the 27th year of the Republic, a total of more than 170 million yuan had been paid in advance. The result of our country's efforts to maintain debt credit was a Sino-British-Japanese customs agreement. Therefore, although the amortization method adopted from the 28th year of the Republic is actually equivalent to a full deferral, this is the fault of the creditors themselves, not a sign of our country's declining debt repayment ability.

How much debt expense has the national treasury paid since the start of the war? It can be obtained by comparing the current debt burden before and after the war for domestic and foreign debts.

Comparison of Current Debt Burden Before and After the War for Domestic and Foreign Debts Issued Before the War July 1st of the 26th Year of the Republic January 1st of the 29th Year of the Republic January 1st of the 29th Year of the Republic Value During the War

(Note) Calculated by myself; including the two types of electric power public bonds managed by the Ministry of Light Industry. Pre-war bonds do not include those without reliable guarantees and those not organized. (100 million yuan of national currency) Within two and a half years after the start of the war, 255 million yuan of principal has been repaid, and if combined with interest, it should be around 600 million yuan. If the principal and interest on foreign debt repaid for the three years from the 26th year to the 28th year of the Republic totaled 226.27 million yuan, and if the repayment amount for the 26th year is halved, then the wartime repayment reached 172 million yuan (Note) According to Edward Gillingham.

Due to the change to the amortization method, the annual debt expense has been reduced to about 40 million yuan, and assuming that 600 million yuan has been repaid by the end of the 28th year of the Republic, then it is estimated that it will be no more than 640 million yuan by the end of the 29th year of the Republic.

As for administrative expenses, including industrial, transportation, and subsidy expenses. The annual amount before the war was 215 million yuan. After the start of the war, 70% of the original amount was uniformly distributed, then the actual annual expenditure at the beginning was no more than 150 million yuan. Assuming that from the 28th year of the Republic, due to the high price of everything, the original salary is still paid, then by the end of that year, the total amount of this expenditure was 440 million yuan, and a total of 655 million yuan by the end of the 29th year of the Republic.

The above are expenditures of an expense nature (i.e., expenditures of a consumption nature); in addition, there are expenditures of an asset nature (i.e., expenditures of a production nature); the annual amount before the war was only about 60-70 million to 100 million yuan, but now it has increased significantly.

Regarding this type of asset-based expenditure, it should be divided into two categories: the monetary system aspect and the general industry and trade aspect.

As mentioned earlier, one of our purposes in reviewing national expenditures is to observe whether it is related to the issuance of legal tender? Therefore, expenditures under the reserve fund item when legal tender is additionally issued should also be included in the statistics. As shown in the following table, from the start of the war to the end of June of the 19th year of the Republic, the increase in expenditures under the cash item reached more than 1 billion, and the increase in expenditures under the guarantee item reached more than 1.55 billion. If the average monthly increase in the past three years is used as a standard, to estimate the total amount of increased expenditure needed by the end of the 19th year of the Republic, the cumulative total for the cash item will be 1.335 billion; the cumulative total for the guarantee item will be 2.072 billion, and the total will be a little less than 3.41 billion yuan. As shown in the following table: Newly added portion of legal tender issuance reserve item (Note) (1) The number on July 1st of the 26th year of the Republic is subtracted from the number on January 1st of the 29th year of the Republic, and the remainder is the newly added portion during the war. (2) This number is the average number obtained over two and a half years (i.e., 30 months). (3) It is assumed that the increase in legal tender issuance in the 29th year of the Republic is equal to the average number of the previous two and a half years and calculated. The second type of asset-based expenditure for the monetary system is the establishment of the Sino-British Exchange Equalization Fund. The total amount of the fund is 10 million pounds, equivalent to 165.5 million yuan of national currency. China and Britain each contribute 5 million pounds, that is, 82.75 million yuan.

The third type is that in mid-December of the 26th year of the Republic, public bonds of 17 million yuan were issued to reorganize the finances of Guangxi Province. This income should have been spent on reorganizing the finances of Guangxi Province.

The asset expenditure for general industries and trades should be at least equal to the issue of the six hundred million yuan of public bonds from 28th year of the republic. In fact, it may even be more than this number. During the war factories are helped to move and resume work in the interior, and large-scale state-run military factories are opened. In order to implement state-run export businesses, the fund for the Trade Commission alone may have been invested more than 100 million yuan, and it is estimated that by the end of the 29th year of the Republic, it will reach 150 million yuan.

In summary, regarding non-war-related national expenditures, from the start of the war to the end of the 28th year of the Republic, it has reached 1.957 billion yuan. It is estimated that it will require more than 3.4 billion yuan by the end of the 29th year of the Republic.

### Financial Commentary (Continued)

— Saint Kay-Qiong

However, the hopes of speculators will be disillusioned, and it itself may encounter the same demise as "May 2nd," because the seriousness of the current situation lies in its unclear trend. Will Vietnam compromise with Japan and allow the Japanese army to use it as a base to attack China? If Vietnam is negative, then Japan cannot attack China's southwest, and the seemingly serious situation is actually not serious. If Vietnam is positive, then the Chinese government has already stated that it will definitely send troops into Vietnam, and in the initial stage of the Japanese army's use of Vietnam, the outcome of the war is still difficult to predict; at the same time, the international changes caused by the Sino-Japanese war in Vietnam are even more difficult to predict. Therefore, foreign exchange will relax in an uncertain situation, and speculators will definitely fail; in a positive situation, foreign exchange will hover and wait for international changes to determine the trend, and speculators are standing on the edge of a cliff, and their safety is unpredictable.

In summary, the tight exchange rate in the past two weeks is due to old longs using rumors and the situation to dispose of the August-term exchanges purchased in July, and new longs using the situation to hope that the exchange rate will tighten in order to make a fortune, but the opportunity for the exchange rate to ease is greater, and the opportunity for it to tighten is smaller.

### Foreign Stocks in August

The situation of foreign stocks in August was very sluggish in the first two weeks. The transaction value of industrial stocks was more than 20 million yuan per week, and the average market price rose from 231 to 243; the transaction value of rubber stocks fell from 4 million yuan to 2 million yuan, and the average market price hovered between 251-8. During this period, due to the instability of the situation, such as the Vietnam issue and the Shanghai Concession defense issue, both investors and speculators were quietly watching the changes. As soon as the price fell slightly, there were buyers to purchase, and vice versa, as soon as there was a slight rise, sellers immediately followed suit to sell, causing the stock market to be lifeless, and the rubber stocks were weak because the Dutch government wanted to levy an additional 5% tax rate on the export of rubber according to the current tax rules. Entering the second half of August, the stock market suddenly became enthusiastic. The transaction value of industrial stocks rose to about 30 million yuan, the average market price gradually rose from 243 to 265, the transaction value of rubber stocks rose from 5.5 million yuan to 8.8 million yuan, and the average market price soared from 254 to above 300. In this period, the long-neglected rubber stocks rose sharply due to reports of large-scale purchases of rubber by the United States, and even industrial stocks were stirred up with a rising trend. At the same time, the Shanghai defense issue has been resolved fairly satisfactorily, which is also a reason for promoting the activity of the stock market.

Looking at the stock market for the entire month of August, the transaction volume for four weeks reached 8 million shares, and the transaction value was more than 12 million yuan. The lowest average market price for industrial stocks was 231.48 on the 5th, and the highest was 265.67 on the 30th. The lowest for rubber stocks was 251.58 on the 6th, and the highest was 309.51 on the 29th.

The most active stocks in the market each week in this month include six types of industrial stocks: China Land Reclamation, Jardine Matheson, Ewo Cotton Mill, Union Dock, International Trust, and Steel Corporation, and one type of rubber stock: Anglo-Java. These eight stocks traded 3,446,000 shares, accounting for a little less than half of the total transaction volume in August, and the transaction value was 9,076,700 yuan, accounting for a little less than three-quarters of the total transaction value in August. The detailed analysis is as follows.

### Supplement to the Secret Marks on Chinese Small Notes

Yesterday's newspaper mentioned the secret marks on the new 10-cent and 20-cent notes of the Bank of China. There are still omissions. Upon investigation, in addition to the secret marks mentioned in yesterday's newspaper, there are also the four characters "Tang Linkun carved" hidden in the trees to the right of the Temple of Heaven, above the stone wall. Also, in addition to the four characters "Bank of China" already seen in yesterday's newspaper on its left wall, there are also the two characters "Dadong" in the trees next to it, located at the end of the long stone steps, and also the letter P in the carved flowers at the end of the right corner pillar on the back. This type of small note has long been in circulation in the interior, but it is still rare in Shanghai. Banks holding this type of banknote consider it a rare commodity, and even if they have it, customers still have difficulty exchanging it. Although there are reports of quite a lot of aluminum coins being supplied, many people still cannot find a way to exchange them, indicating that it has failed to provide convenience to the public and has lost its effect of circulation.

### Indian Silver Spot and Future Prices Plunge

Bombay, 31st - Indian silver market: spot price plunged 14 annas, future price fell 15 annas, market conditions were flat, and a total of 100 orders were traded. British and American silver were both out of the market.

Shanghai's Cloth Industry

Suffers from Congestion

Inland Yarn and Cloth Suffer from Anemia - One Spindle Can Earn a Net Profit of Eight Yuan

According to statistics, the amount of cotton yarn stockpiled in foreign warehouses has exceeded 300,000 bales (including Chinese, British, and Japanese yarn), and the amount of cotton cloth stockpiled in foreign warehouses is estimated to be no less than 10 million pieces. At the same time, the spindles of the yarn and cloth factories are still spinning day and night, producing non-stop. However, yarn and cloth factories with a larger scope of assets have already implemented small sabbaths (stopping for a day and night every ten days), or reduced the production work of spinning and weaving machines by 2% or more. As for factories with a smaller scope and weak assets, they are all reducing night work. If the sea routes are often blocked (Hong Kong-Vietnam shipping has also been suspended), and actual sales remain sluggish for a long time, there is simply no way to revive them except to close down. It is reported that the funds tied up in cloth accumulated by a certain cloth factory have reached more than 600,000 yuan. The total amount accumulated by various cloth factories (including Chinese and Japanese) and foreign warehouses in the special zone is of course even more astonishing. A certain gentleman in the yarn factory industry just came from Chongqing and told reporters: A factory with only 5,000 spindles in Hangu retreated to Chongqing. Because the supply and demand of production and consumption could not meet, and prices rose sharply, it could earn 40,000 yuan a day after net expenses, in other words, each spindle could earn a net profit of 8 yuan a day and night. A certain gentleman who is experienced in the yarn industry said to me well, he said: "Shanghai's yarn and cloth industry is suffering from congestion, and the yarn and cloth industry in Free China is suffering from anemia. Shanghai's yarn and cloth cannot be digested (only production but no consumption) is equivalent to a snake eating an eel. The virtual scene of selling short and buying long will eventually decline." It is a very pertinent talk that the yarn price is unable to rise and falls sharply.

### Cool Autumn Brings Increased Sales of Woolen Cloth

The woolen cloth business is gradually coming to the market, as the time has entered autumn, the weather is turning cooler, and actual sales have been launched one after another. Local buyers have successively inquired, and the daily shipments of major wholesale merchants are also increasing.

### Hongji Coal Adds Ten Yuan

The white coal market: in recent days, foreign exchange has tightened, and Vietnam has been blocked again, the source is uncertain, so the market atmosphere has unanimously become bullish. Yesterday, Nanyang, Yitai, and Hongji white coal from the same industry were 116 yuan per ton, an increase of ten yuan from the previous price, so the door shops on this street have also raised prices.

### Peach Kernels Are Sold as Soon as They Arrive

20 pieces of Jinan peach kernels have recently arrived. Because it is in the Mid-Autumn Festival season, there is more demand, and the market stock is thin, so the opening price is more expensive. Yesterday, it was heard that the opening price had reached 195 yuan.

### Car White Slightly Loosens

Yesterday, the sugar market trend was slightly flat. The guild drew a plate, spot price 24 crude white, this warehouse 478 yuan, the import price was still 76 and a half yuan, no transaction was concluded. Dutch red, delivery on September 6, was still 64 yuan, delivery on September 27, was 63 yuan and two corners, a small amount. Taikoo car white B mark 76 and a half yuan, a small amount, DY mark slightly loosened to 73 yuan seven corners to six corners, XH mark 73 yuan four corners, a small amount. The domestic Dongxiang red plate rose by five corners, and Diao Qing rose by four, no transaction was concluded.

### Dance (3)

The ancient sages established rituals, including the village drinking and archery ceremonies, because the grandeur of ritual and music was most evident in the court and ancestral temples, leaving the common people unaware. Therefore, these practices were established to prevent hypocrisy and curb licentiousness among the people, allowing them to be cultivated in the arts of sound, light, and culture, so they would understand the principles of respecting rulers, parents, and superiors. Later generations abandoned these rituals, leading to a decline in public morals, with people indulging in depravity and extravagance, doing whatever they pleased. This was not as good as the Westerners' hymns and dances, which still conveyed the intention of the great kings of old. In China, during the Spring and Autumn period, usurpations arose, and by the Warring States period, the pursuits of the feudal lords were limited to dogs, horses, music, and women, indulging their personal preferences. This prompted Mencius to lament the difference between ancient and contemporary music. Therefore, the flourishing of ritual and music in the Zhou dynasty lasted no more than three hundred years of the Western Zhou, and after the eastward relocation, it gradually declined and was lost. Grand dances were one aspect of music. In ancient times, beauty in both sound and appearance was valued, to showcase virtue and symbolize merit, and neither should be neglected. Therefore, martial dances used shields and axes, promoting vigor and precision, to demonstrate to soldiers proper and uniform marching, which was akin to teaching warfare. Civil dances used feathers and flutes, with variations in pitch, speed, and rhythm, to demonstrate to the young the proper etiquette of advancing, retreating, bowing, and yielding, which was akin to learning ritual. Later generations, driven by a taste for sensual pleasures, assigned these roles to female entertainers. The so-called "dancing robes and singing fans, long sleeves and light skirts" were highly fashionable during the Han, Wei, and Six Dynasties. This, before the rise of theatrical arias and acrobatic tumbling, was the path by which public morals gradually declined. Alas! When will we see the revival of ritual and courtesy in the villages?

### Advice to Rice Merchants

— Sun Choucheng

Rice prices have recently been gradually increasing. It is said that this is due to the control and additional taxes, which have reduced the supply. However, it is also true that rice merchants are taking advantage of this situation to manipulate and hoard, which is to be expected. As a result, those in the salaried class who earn a hundred yuan a month cannot even support a family of five. Other poor laborers toil all day but still find it difficult to get enough to eat, which is regrettable. With ordinary goods, one can try to save money if the price goes up. But rice is a staple for both the rich and the poor. It is essential for survival and cannot be lacking for even a day. How can it be monopolized? Moreover, some unscrupulous rice merchants have come up with the idea of inserting cardboard or wooden planks into measuring containers like 'sheng' and 'dou' to take up space, thus reducing the amount of rice measured, defrauding the poor. This crime is unforgivable. Mr. Yuan Lamei, a poetry enthusiast with a heart for public service, presented ten "Seven-Character Quatrains Admonishing Rice Merchants of the Isolated Island", saying that ill-gotten gains are easily lost, an ancient saying that is clear to all; that being rich without benevolence is unacceptable to Heaven's justice; that hoarding rice for profit will be punished in one's descendants. He explained the benefits and harms with earnest words, which are beneficial to society and not comparable to meaningless moaning. These are recorded below in hopes that rice merchants will read them and correct their behavior if they are doing wrong, and encourage themselves to do better if they are not. (1) Why are rice prices soaring? The population has suddenly increased by millions. Supply cannot meet demand, making it harder than ever for the poor to find food. (2) The majority of the blame should be attributed to control. The source is restricted by taxes. They worry about dangers, losing their cost and only a few boats arrive each month. (3) When the quantity arriving is little the price rises even more. Rich families love to hoard surplus grain. Speculation begins from here hoarding and storing the warehouse is filled to the brim. (4) Big merchants hoard and manipulate, laughing and cursing while playing deaf and dumb. Being rich without benevolence in a time of national crisis is something the conscious cannot face the heavens over. (5) You should know that ill-gotten gains are easily exhausted, with children and grandchildren squandering them as they rely on their wealth. Dance halls and gambling dens repay past debts. Who says Heaven's heart is unfair? (6) The measurement and scales lack fairness. The bottom is lined, secretly changing the 'sheng' level. Exploiting a bit may seem like a small matter, but retribution to children and grandchildren is most clear. (7) It is not too late to awaken and repent. A little glimmer of enlightenment appears. Once you hoarded now loosen the bag. The common people await your public distribution like refreshing rain. (8) It is useless to beg on your knees at the red door. With rice as precious as pearls, who will bestow kindness? Empty stomachs can't expect to be satisfied. There will be no more rice-giving mother for Wangsun (nobleman). (9) Raising foreign rice to aid the poor and crushed grains for everyone to ask for. People throng, carrying sacks and baskets. How can delicate daughters survive? (10) The speeding red wheels crush embroidered mud. Who cares for the suffering people? Crying from hunger is ignored, human warmth is greatly inconsistent.

### The Evolution of Shoes

— Lian

When the human head was covered with hair as the sole protection, the feet were naturally bare and without any protection.

Many years ago, a rough sandal-like shoe made of animal skin first appeared on human feet. The form of this shoe was naturally very simple, made with wood, leather, bark, or straw as the sole, and narrow strips of animal skin as straps. This type of shoe was also prevalent on the feet of people in the Eastern continent.

Later, a type of shoe that protected the entire foot gradually appeared, using lace or thin rope as straps. This type of shoe was generally worn by Roman dignitaries. These shoes were available in black, white, and red. Black was worn by men, white by women, and noble knights wore red shoes.

Around 1100 AD, a French nobleman with oddly shaped feet ordered a shoemaker to make a pair of long, pointed shoes. Everyone followed suit, and these pointed shoes became popular in the upper classes of England and France. During the reign of King Richard II, the pointed toes of the shoes became even longer, making walking difficult. Some clever nobles connected the pointed toes of the shoes to their knees with gold and silver chains, so that the long pointed toes curved like sickles. Later, as more and more people wore these shoes, the country issued a law prohibiting anyone below the nobility from wearing shoes with pointed toes exceeding a certain limit. But in the end, because the form of these pointed shoes was not aesthetically pleasing, they were gradually eliminated, and wide-toed shoes rose in popularity.

Two centuries ago, boots were very long. For example, the long boots worn by riders were very tall, but they were heavy and inconvenient. Later, a shorter type of long boot was invented, which was convenient for both walking and riding. Later, the height of the long boots was reduced, becoming the prototype of the leather shoes that are currently popular.

In France and Belgium, farmers mostly wear shoes called wooden shoes. These are made by hollowing out the middle part of a whole piece of wood. The shape is very similar to the dugouts used by ancient barbarians. In addition, there is a strange type of wooden shoe (different from ordinary clogs) with a high iron ring attached to the bottom, so that the feet are raised to avoid dampness and mud.

Times are constantly progressing, and human wisdom is constantly developing. Taking boots and shoes as an example, the shoes we wear now are thousands of times better than before, and newer, more beautiful, and more durable shoes are constantly being manufactured.

Finally, I would like to add one last point: when boots and shoes are worn too tightly, they can hinder blood circulation and cause corns and bone inflammation. At the same time, we must avoid high heels, because they put all of our body weight on the front of the foot, damaging the muscles of the foot, which is very harmful to health.

### One Week Economic Menu

— Ms. Hua Ying

Yesterday, Mr. Yang Xingchu of the Xie Da Industrial Company on Sijing Road forwarded a letter to the editor praising this menu, saying that many housewives rush to read this publication every Monday to prepare their week's meals according to my menu. I was very happy to read this, feeling that my menu was not made in vain. Originally, everyone's tastes are different, and there are also regional differences, so I also know that this menu cannot be completely satisfactory. However, it serves as a reference for housewives who cannot think of what to buy before going to the vegetable market every morning. Mr. Yang, seeing that housewives welcome my menu, suddenly proposed a plan to cooperate with me. He said in his letter: "We have our own farm, and we produce all the vegetables in your menu. Producers and consumers can connect directly, which can reduce commissions. We now have three options: (1) Sell your menu ingredients purely (mainly vegetables). (2) We open a cheap weekly restaurant. (It can also prepare large fish and meat) (3) Run the first two items at the same time. If you are sincere, we can discuss a detailed plan. I wonder what your opinion is?" Mr. Yang's plan is very good, and other comrades may want to try it. As for cooperating with me, I dare not accept. First, I ask myself that I am too inexperienced to do social work. Second, I am in the position of a housewife, born to be a "go to the kitchen" type, busy at home all day long, and I really don't have time to take care of other things, so Mr. Yang's sincerity has to be rejected. Enough talk, let's see what is on this week's menu:

### Drinking Tea and Smoking

Tea and cigarettes are very popular these days, and they are almost essential items in every household. When guests arrive, a cup of tea and a cigarette are indispensable. If you can't even offer tea and cigarettes, it's a very shabby thing.

Most people have a great affection for tea and cigarettes, especially literati. When their literary inspiration dries up, they will have a cigarette in hand and a cup in their mouth. It is said that literary inspiration will immediately flow in, and it also has the effect of stimulating the spirit. Therefore, tea and cigarettes occupy a very important position in daily life and social settings.

Scientifically, tea is considered unhealthy because it contains theine, which has toxic properties and can stimulate the nervous system and accelerate the movement of the heart. It also has an excitatory effect, but this applies to those who drink strong tea and drink large amounts. Cigarettes contain the toxic substance nicotine, which can stimulate the heart and weaken it. Therefore, we should separate tea and cigarettes as much as possible. If this is not possible, then it is advisable to eat less. When a cigarette is smoked to the butt, nicotine concentrates there, so smokers should use a cigarette holder and should not smoke a few puffs and put it out to smoke at another time. If the amount of cigarettes is not large, then cut the cigarette in half, and discard it immediately after smoking, so that you will be exposed to less nicotine.

It is best to drink tea lightly, because light tea has a diuretic effect, increases the excretory function of the stomach, and can neutralize acidic toxins in the stomach. Because we eat a lot of acidic meat foods, which decompose into an acidic toxin in the stomach and cause indigestion and mental confusion, theine is alkaline and neutralizes the acid, causing the toxicity to disappear. Tea also contains iron and manganese, which kill bacteria and replenish blood. All pathogenic bacteria cannot survive in tea liquid. Green tea contains a small amount of vitamins A and B. Recently, an American doctor discovered a nutrient in tea leaves that is very important for human growth and health, and the content in green tea is richer than other things, but there is not much in black tea. Therefore, among the two hobbies of tea and cigarettes, cigarettes are harmful and useless (perhaps someone will discover its beneficial functions in the future), while tea is beneficial and harmful, but drinking light tea is definitely beneficial to us.

### Beriberi and Food

— Guangjun

Since the fall of the Western Suburbs, our rice supply has depended on outside sources. Its composition is probably not as suitable for Chinese people as domestic rice. Therefore, this year, dampness and beriberi are the most common diseases.

Dampness is a type of skin disease, where granules and red spots appear on the skin, causing extreme itching. The more you scratch, the more it itches, and the more spots appear. The disease is a contagious bacterial infection. The biggest cause is a lack of resistance in the body. After the small blisters inside the toes rupture, the "ooze" spreads to other parts, causing itching and the formation of sores, gradually spreading throughout the body. The first key to treatment is not to scratch, as this prevents further spread, and the condition can gradually improve over time. Avoid applying irritants such as "Lysol" and "cologne," as they further irritate and dry out the skin. Apply "acid ointment" to moisturize the skin. It is also not advisable to wash frequently. If symptoms are severe, "sodium arsenate" injections can be used, but must be administered by a doctor.

Beriberi is caused by a deficiency of vitamin B. Symptoms include swelling of the feet without pain or itching, but only a feeling of weakness in the feet. Treatment includes vitamin "B" injections, and we can also treat it with our daily diet by eating more red beans, bran, tomatoes, etc. However, tomatoes, although rich in vitamin B, are difficult for those who are not used to them to swallow. They are often mixed with fish and meat, but still taste sour and lack freshness. Since autumn, food has gradually shifted from light to rich flavors. Adding tomatoes to oxtail soup makes it delicious, nourishing, and rich in vitamin B, which is especially beneficial to the human body. However, cooking requires experience to achieve the true flavor. The Da Hong Yun Restaurant on Fourth Malu has a stir-fried tomato oxtail soup, which is quite capable of showing off cooking skills.

### Rambling Thoughts on Choosing a Residence

— Zheng Yimei

A window of moonlight, clear on the table, no need to light lamps or candles, this is also an economical way.

Where there are mountains and rivers, build a few houses, live there while alive, and be buried there when dead, no need to return to one's hometown again, how comfortable, how simple.

In a small courtyard, there are rockeries and banana trees, green on the window gauze, as high as the eaves. After chanting and whistling, one cannot help but feel free and distant.

No books on the shelves, no paintings on the walls, no inkstones on the table, no flowers in the vase, although the furnishings are rich, I have no need for them.

Wang Jie's pet cat, Shen Qian's brocade carp, Cai Cuo's parrot, and bright children are all excellent decorative items in the home.

There should be a plank bridge and flowing water in front of the door, and a hibiscus fence behind the house.

Plant fruit trees in the small garden, flowers can be appreciated, fruits can be eaten, truly a win-win situation. A bright young servant holds the inkstone, and a wise maid adds incense. Or copy Lin Laiqin's calligraphy, or write inscriptions... The crane does not know that there are disturbances outside the door, isn't that wonderful!

In the summer window, it is appropriate to display Ni Yunlin's paintings, to sit quietly with open collar, to recite the Nanhua Sutra, to chew betel nuts and nutmeg, to talk about Zen with friends, to take a nap, dreaming in the depths of sweet blackness; it is appropriate to play with small Six Dynasties works, and the spirit will meet with the ancients.

### Hidden Worries of "Population Inflation"

— Yun

A few months ago, because I had a child, I was evicted by the landlord based on the reason stated in the lease that children were not allowed. At that time, although I searched all over the isolated island within a thirty-mile radius, almost every homeowner's lease had a very strict population restriction, especially not welcoming tenants with children. In the end, I changed the habit of bargaining and exceptionally raised the rent a bit before solving the housing problem with the face of money. Since then, the question of "population inflation" has been floating in my mind from time to time. Originally, in such a situation where rice is like pearls and firewood is like cassia and everything is becoming increasingly expensive, the size of the population is indeed suffering the pain of economic control, because the preparation of the population is money. Therefore, the landlord's restriction on population is not only for the dislike of children, but even more so for fear that these salaried people will not be able to maintain this serious "population inflation" one day and implement a "population collapse".

Recently, the company has been recruiting trainees, which has again stirred up the problem of "population inflation." Because the test questions are not very difficult, the number of family members of the examinees is closely investigated. In the minds of the general manager and others, the ideal examinee is best one who is physically sound and has no family burden, so that it is convenient for the business to freely dispatch them to foreign locations, and it will not cause terrible waves of salary increases, etc. Therefore, during the oral test, they questioned them carefully. The poor examinees still thought that bearing a heavier burden might win sympathy, so they were hired; therefore, they even talked about their grandmother in her eighties. Who would have thought that such a statement would contradict the "population inflation" problem, and instead there was no hope of being hired.

Thinking of those who have already obtained employment, I am afraid that in the near future, the company authorities will also have to carefully investigate the household registration and carry out a round of layoffs! Then, in the future, the conditions for eating, in addition to labor and mental effort, must also have the element of "population will not inflate" in order to be qualified. If this is done, the future of the business will indeed emulate the independence of the military, with great success, doubled harvest, but from where will our country's future masters be cultivated? Although this is only a corner of our reality here, I guess that throughout the entire isolated island, suppressing the "population inflation" problem must already be prevalent.

### New Avian Sayings

Starving little birds, (pronounced diao) starving little birds. Little birds cannot live independently, of course they will starve to death. Rice prices and commodity prices have suddenly increased several times, of course they will starve to death. I advise little birds to turn back as soon as possible, and don't look for trouble anymore.

Chapter Six: A Perilous Experience

Ni Jinshou scrutinized Huo Sang, "Mr. Huo, I'm very worried about you. What exactly happened to you? Where are you injured?"

Huo Sang had already lit a cigarette, shaking his head. "No—I'll ask you first, has Qin Mozhai given a report?"

Ni Jinshou said, "Not yet. I heard that Dr. Bai hasn't returned yet."

"In that case, you've been to the Asia Eastern Hotel, haven't you?"

"Yes, they didn't recognize you. They only said that someone had been shot, in the face."

Huo Sang nodded. "Did you extract the bullet—from the wooden wall next to the telephone? You must have seen it. That telephone room has two glass sides and one cement wall. The side where the machine is installed is the wooden wall."

Ni Jinshou said with an embarrassed expression, "I didn't look closely. The bullet hasn't been taken out yet." He paused, explaining as if to justify himself, "At the time, I was a bit flustered. I only thought about finding your whereabouts, and then quickly called your residence—"

Before Huo Sang could finish speaking, he nodded repeatedly, "I'm very sorry to have made you anxious. But I couldn't inform you either." He exhaled smoke, looking at me, "Bao Lang, I think you must also feel a kind of inexplicable annoyance. In fact, my sudden disappearance wasn't without some kind of notification for you."

I replied in surprise, "Notification? Who notified me?"

Huo Sang said, "There was a notification, but the method was a bit novel. It's just that your observation skills are lacking."

I couldn't figure it out. "Strange! Did you leave any symbols anywhere?"

Huo Sang nodded. "Yes, if you've studied the marching techniques of boy scouts, you'll know there's a method of leaving marks along the way to indicate directions. Wasn't a piece of the glass in the telephone room broken? If you had seen it, thought about it, you would have known that my departure without saying goodbye must have had unavoidable reasons."

I replied, "I didn't pay attention. At that time, I was eager to go out with Yu Gantang, so I didn't even notice if the glass was there or not."

"That's why I said your observation skills are lacking."

"Alright, stop talking nonsense. What exactly happened to you?"
