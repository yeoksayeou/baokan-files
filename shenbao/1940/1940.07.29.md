Editorial

### The National Question in Today's International Arena

With the evolution of the European War's future still uncertain, new stirrings are seen in the international arena regarding national union and division. In the Far East, India and Burma both have independence movements in preparation. The Breton people within France, after four hundred years of quiescence, have suddenly developed an attempt to organize a national state after France's defeat. On the other hand, the three small Baltic states, having just gained independence through national self-determination after the previous European war, have cancelled their independence and joined the Soviet Union through a voluntary request. As for Britain's recent formal recognition of the Czech provisional government and the conclusion of a new alliance agreement with Poland, although they are measures to increase combat strength, they also signify the revival of these two ill-fated national states. The ongoing Sino-Japanese War in the Far East is the greatest national movement of modern times, symbolizing independence, freedom, and justice, and waging a life-or-death struggle against oppression, enslavement, and aggression. The current international phenomenon, while superficially chaotic and obscure, making it difficult to grasp its mainstream, is nevertheless a situation in which the national question is acting as its soul.

Nationalism is something that came with modern capitalism. At the beginning of the 19th century, various weak nations began to awaken due to the upheavals of international economic and political evolution. Even the most reactionary Tsar Alexander of Russia is said to have been moved by the principle of national self-determination, stating: "God has chosen monarchs for the happiness and harmony of the people, and therefore they must not cede territory against the will and interests of the people." But the high tide of national movements was during the previous European War. The Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Turkish Empire both encountered the misfortune of division under this principle. What is regrettable is that the application of this principle at that time was not solely for the sake of the oppressed and to make it consistent with justice and fairness; instead, it often accommodated the intentions of the victorious powers, disregarding the will of certain nations. The Versailles Treaty system contained several seeds of disaster, and those related to the national question were the most obvious, leading to the annexation of Austria by Germany, the Sudetenland dispute, the Danzig issue, and the problems of ethnic minorities and territorial disputes regarding Poland, Romania, and Yugoslavia in recent years, all of which can be traced back to the outcome of the previous European War. As for the independence of the Baltic states, although it was voluntarily carried out by the Soviet Union, there were other international machinations involved. The Soviet Union's support for the principle of national self-determination was not unconditional, especially when such separatist movements contained anti-Soviet sentiments. Therefore, the outbreak of this European War and the recent turmoil in Europe all have their own historical causes and effects when viewed from the perspective of the national question. Now, Europe and the world map are about to be redrawn. Whether it can avoid repeating past mistakes and planting seeds of future disaster is the focus of greatest concern for people with a sense of justice.

Nationalism and national self-determination are both principles that should be praised. The reason they have turned into sources of various disasters is none other than their unfortunate intermingling with various adverse conditions. Therefore, a correct national movement must: first, be in accordance with the principles of justice and fairness and must not be mixed with other reactionary and base motives; second, the assistance of strong countries to weak nations should be out of genuine motives and should not be abused to achieve some unjust desires; third, weak nations themselves must not be eager for quick success and unscrupulous means, lest they fall into disaster unknowingly. Over the past decade, aggressors have used disguised national slogans in the international arena to carry out many conspiracies. Even China has suffered many tribulations as a result. But the measures taken by Nazi Germany against Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Poland, while their methods may be questionable, have not been without their rational basis in history, especially from a national point of view. These precedents should not be misused by the aggressors in the Far East.

Now, a new wave of national movements is being launched around the world. If the European War continues to spread, it is unknown how many more new problems will arise in succession. Will the results of these evolutions lay the foundation for the future era of happiness, or will they repeatedly bury seeds of endless disaster? It all depends on how these national movements develop. In other words, will they represent the promotion of justice and fairness, or will they cover up their ugly inner workings with national slogans? At this critical juncture, the most noteworthy point is that countries that aspire to promote genuine world peace, regardless of the complexity of their actual international relations, must be generous in providing assistance to those nations that are truly engaged in life-and-death struggles for justice and fairness. Only then can they prove that they are genuinely concerned about the future of the world and mankind. And the resisting China is such a touchstone that is universally effective.

### Welles Meets with Soviet Ambassador; US and Soviet Union to Renew Trade Agreement; Japan Feels Threatened by US Restrictions; Prepares to Apply for Oil and Iron Export Permits

Washington: With the US-Soviet trade agreement expiring in ten days, US Under Secretary of State Welles met yesterday with Soviet Ambassador to the US, Oumansky, for preliminary talks on renewing the trade agreement. Welles acknowledged that he initiated the talks, leading to widespread speculation that the US is eager to renew the US-Soviet trade agreement and that Secretary of State Hull's principles have prevailed. Hull's principle is to maintain trade with all reserve countries even in times of turmoil. (International News Service dispatch, 28th)

Washington: Acting US Secretary of State Welles told reporters yesterday that the Maritime Commission's decision to allow the Soviet Union to charter oil tankers from the California Oil Company to transport gasoline to Vladivostok, while rejecting similar applications from Japan and Spain, does not involve a shift in US foreign policy. Welles stated that the Commission's actions were based entirely on the danger of transportation. Ships traveling to Spain or Japan would be forced to pass through hostile areas, while oil tankers traveling to Vladivostok would not encounter any acts of war along the way. The Japanese side here is deeply concerned about President Roosevelt's announcement of an embargo on the export of American aircraft gasoline, alkylate, scrap copper, and scrap iron to Japan, as well as the US government's granting of permission to Soviet companies to charter American oil tankers to transport gasoline to Vladivostok, and the prior rejection of similar applications from Japanese companies. On Friday, President Roosevelt firmly stated at a press conference that the US export licensing order was not directed against any particular country, but was intended to preserve US military raw materials related to strategy for US national defense purposes. Although President Roosevelt made this assurance, most diplomatic circles here acknowledge that the new export control measures are a tool to restrict the export of special raw materials to Europe and Asia. The Japanese side here believes that Japan can apply to the United States for export licenses on the day the order requiring export licenses takes effect on August 1st. If the US government refuses or restricts Japan's application, then President Roosevelt's order can be regarded as an embargo. It is believed that Welles and Japanese Ambassador to the US, Kensuke Horinouchi, discussed the President's order requiring export licenses and the actions of the Maritime Commission on Friday. (United Press dispatch, 28th)

Tokyo: Well-informed sources here say that the US placing oil and iron under a strict export licensing system is stimulating Japan's southward policy and is likely to encourage Japan to advance into the Dutch East Indies, as the Dutch East Indies are the second largest source of oil supply needed by Japan, and are rich in steel and other major raw materials. Some Japanese public law experts have advocated cutting off the US's supply of zinc and rubber from Southeast Asia in retaliation for the US's obstruction of Japan's handling of the "China Incident." Now, this proposal is indeed important, because the US is the largest supplier of oil and iron needed by Japan. Therefore, this blockade will be a major blow to Japan's military preparations and national production expansion plans. However, political circles say that Japan has long anticipated this move by the US, and it is not surprising that the US has restricted oil and iron. However, whether this order can be smoothly implemented is still a question, and the Japanese government has already made preparations to cope with this blockade of oil and iron. Japan has already purchased large quantities of oil and iron, and Japan has also considered developing China's iron mines as a countermeasure. (United Press dispatch, 28th)

Japanese Ambassador Refuses to Criticize; Will Not Protest to the US for the Time Being

Washington: Japanese Ambassador to the US, Kensuke Horinouchi, received an explanation from Acting Secretary of State Welles regarding the executive branch's extension of export controls to oil and scrap iron, which he then relayed to President Roosevelt. After visiting Welles, Horinouchi refused to comment on the impact of this measure on Japan when meeting with reporters. He said that he went to the State Department at Welles' request and was not there to make any statement at the instruction of Tokyo. He also said that he had not received any information from home regarding the reaction to the new US law. Observers believe that Horinouchi's statement indicates that Tokyo will not protest this move to the US for the time being. The Japanese side believes that the Japanese government will not decide on its opinion until this export control law is implemented. It is expected that this law will be tested in a few days, because the Japanese have purchased a large quantity of steel and scrap iron recently. If the US government implements an export permit system for Japan, then the facts revealed by this test will be beyond doubt. (United Press dispatch, 28th)

Tokyo: After the US announced that the export of oil and scrap iron would require special licenses, people here were quite surprised. Political circles and newspapers alike believe that this ban will have a significant impact on Japan's interests. The Japanese Embassy in the US has already received instructions from the Japanese government to inquire about the US government's intentions regarding this issue. The "Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun" stated that if the US adopts a threatening attitude towards Japan, then the US should also prepare for Japan's strong resistance. Japan firmly believes that if the UK and the US are not forced to abandon their deeply entrenched policy of maintaining the status quo, then genuine international peace will be difficult to achieve. From Japan's point of view, if the imperialist forces of the UK and the US cannot be eliminated from East Asia, then the new order based on the principle of "Asia for Asians" cannot be established. The US has no close racial ties or other important relations with East Asia. As the national consciousness of Asians is increasingly developing, if the US tries to contain it, Japan will make effective resistance. And the US's suspension of exports will close the door to East Asia for the US. Japan's current actions must be based on the principle of "an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth," and the US should bear the responsibility for the implementation of this principle. The fate of the new East Asia will not be affected by US oil and iron. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 28th)

### Soviet Navy Day: Naval Chief Delivers Speech – Strength Increased Threefold in Two Years; Determined to Protect Maritime Territory

Moscow – On Soviet Navy Day, Naval Commissar Kuznetsov delivered a speech stating, “In the past year, we have added thousands of miles to our borders in the Baltic, North Sea, and Black Sea. Militarily, these new borders are extremely important. The situation in the Baltic Sea has greatly changed. Two hundred years ago, the Russian Navy defeated the Swedish Navy in the Hanko and Erenta Peninsula areas. Currently, the Soviet fleet is once again stationed near the peninsula. At the same time, the Soviet Baltic Fleet is conducting exercises from Kronstadt to Liepāja. They will never give up their newly acquired defenses. The experience of the Second Imperialist War has deeply convinced us that a country along the coast must possess a combined naval, land, and air force to resist foreign aggression. Therefore, our naval power must be as strong as the land and air forces so that we can assist in defending the motherland when necessary. In 1940, our naval power increased by 50% compared to 1939. The rapid increase in naval power is due to the construction of giant ships. The development of our submarine fleet has been very rapid. The total number of new submarines this year will increase threefold compared to 1939. At the same time, there are many ships under construction that will join naval activities in recent years. The strength of the naval air force has also increased, and coastal defense is being improved. However, we still cannot consider it perfect. Some countries may be extremely envious of our new power, but in our view, this scale is not sufficient. With the rapid development of the navy, it is necessary to accelerate the training of personnel. Young people across the country are eager to study at naval schools, as evidenced by the number of applications. The Soviet People's Committee has ordered the establishment of specialized schools in seven cities to allow students to study naval discipline before entering naval academies. It is said that all senior high school students in the designated seven cities will apply to naval academies. The Soviet people deeply love the Red Army and Navy and do their best to strengthen the combat power of the Red Army and Navy. In addition, figures such as Stalin, Molotov, Voroshilov, and Zhetnov are also very concerned about the navy. Therefore, our Soviet Navy believes that reliable guarantees have been obtained regarding the implementation of the tasks given by the Party and government.” (TASS dispatch, 28th)

Moscow – Soviet Naval Commissar Admiral Kuznetsov delivered a speech last night on the eve of Navy Day, praising the expansion of the Soviet army last year. He stated that the Soviet Union added a total of 112 warships last year, many of which were torpedo boats. In 1940, the Soviet Union added another 186 warships. In total, the Soviet Navy's tonnage has increased threefold in the past two years. Discussing the experience of the current European war, he believes that strong countries must have strong naval, land, and air forces. For example, Britain's air and land forces are inferior to Germany, and despite its strong navy, it has suffered repeated setbacks. (Haitong dispatch, 28th)

Moscow – The "Red Fleet" newspaper commented on Soviet Navy Day, stating, "Our navy is becoming increasingly powerful. Under Stalin's guidance, a great naval construction plan is being implemented. During this third Five-Year Plan period, the development of our country's naval power has entered a new stage. Our current warships, large and small, are in no way inferior to those of any major power. In 1939, the ships supplied to the navy by our shipbuilding industry increased threefold compared to 1938. The shipbuilding industry is currently planning that by 1942-43, the Soviet Union's shipbuilding output will rank first in the world." In addition, Landekin, a key member of the Soviet Shipbuilding Industry Committee, wrote in the Izvestia newspaper today, "Our shipbuilding industry is now capable of building extremely excellent submarines. The current Soviet submarine fleet is not only not inferior to any major power but has also surpassed the submarine fleets of leading capitalist countries. In 1938, the number of submarines manufactured by the Soviet Union increased by fifteen times compared to 1937." (TASS dispatch, 28th)

### National Policy Outline to be Announced Soon – Content Roughly Divided into Seven Items

Hong Kong – Tokyo dispatch: The Konoe Cabinet decided on the basic national policy outline on the 25th. The Imperial Headquarters and Cabinet Liaison Conference will be held on the morning of the 27th to discuss the basic national policy. It will be resolved according to the original plan. Konoe will present it to the Emperor at noon on the 27th and then convene the cabinet in the afternoon to report the results of the Liaison Conference. It is said that Konoe will publish the publicly available parts of the basic national policy outline in the form of a government statement or near-future talk in the middle of next week. However, the so-called outline is mostly a principle and tends to be too abstract. Therefore, Konoe also intends to publish a concrete implementation plan for several of the principles at the same time to show the government's determination to implement them. The main content of the outline is as follows: (1) Fundamental policy: Implement Japan's ideals and build a Greater East Asia. The so-called Greater East Asia includes the South Seas, Thailand, India, Burma, and Annam. (2) Strengthen national defense. (3) Revamp diplomacy, strengthen the relationship with the German-Italian-Japanese Axis, and actively adjust diplomacy with the United States, the Soviet Union, and other countries. (4) In order to establish a new national defense state, a new political system and a new economic system should be established immediately to establish a Greater East Asia economic sphere and prepare a self-sufficient economic system to avoid dependence on foreign countries. (5) Revamp education. (6) Revitalize science. (7) Strengthen and expand human resources. (Dispatch of the 28th)

### Japanese Government Encourages Childbirth

Tokyo – In order to increase the birth rate, the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare has decided to encourage marriage and childbirth. In addition to encouraging young men and women over the age of twenty to choose partners, it will also take steps to crack down on contraception. At the same time, the government advises private manufacturers to distribute bonuses to employees with children if they make a profit. (Havas dispatch, 27th)

### Weekly War Situation: July 21st to 27th

Chongqing – A spokesman for the Military Affairs Commission stated that the battles in the coastal areas of Zhejiang and Fujian were the most intense in the past week. Under the fierce counterattack of the heroic Chinese soldiers, the Japanese who were eager to move have been driven to collapse. Their exaggerated propaganda and the so-called "strengthening of the blockade" have been completely shattered by China. At a time when the new Japanese cabinet has just been established, the Japanese army has suffered a major blow, which shows that their collapse is not far off. The most important details of the battle are as follows:

Zhejiang and Fujian

The Japanese troops who invaded Zhenhai and its vicinity in Zhejiang were completely surrounded by the Chinese army on the 19th. That night, the Chinese army began a counteroffensive. The Chinese soldiers charged into battle, advancing without retreating. By the evening of the 21st, they had successively recovered all the important strongholds. In the Battle of Qijiao Mountain, the Japanese and Chinese armies fought fiercely. The Chinese army fought more and more bravely and finally captured the mountain. The loss of this important shield shook the Japanese army. After a day and night of fierce attack by the Chinese army, they recovered Zhenhai the next morning. The defeated Japanese fled, and after a victorious pursuit, few Japanese warships survived. That morning, the Chinese army on the left bank of the Yong River launched a fierce mopping-up operation, completely clearing out the Japanese troops. As for the Japanese troops who landed and invaded Yongning, Xiangwu, Sandu, and other places in Fujian, they had completely retreated in defeat by the 21st, suffering heavy losses.

Hubei and Hunan

In Hubei, the Chinese army's offensive on the east bank of the Fu River has been very successful in the past week. One unit attacked the Japanese troops in Suixian on the night of the 22nd and bombarded them with artillery fire. A fire broke out in the city, and the Japanese troops fled outside the city, where countless were killed by the Chinese army. Another unit attacked Zhongxiang on the morning of the 21st, and all the Japanese soldiers guarding Xihu Mountain in the northeast were wiped out by the Chinese army. Subsequently, the Japanese reinforced from Yangzi and counterattacked. The Chinese army engaged them in a fierce battle for half a day, killing many Japanese. As for the Japanese strongholds in the Linxiang and Yueyang areas of northern Hunan, after the Chinese army recovered many places, the Japanese suffered heavy casualties and are now unable to move. The railways and highways in the area have been destroyed everywhere by the Chinese army, and transportation has been interrupted. At the moment, China is taking advantage of the victory to continue expanding its gains.

Shanxi and Henan

The Chinese army in southern Shanxi attacked the Japanese troops near Yangcheng, Gaoping, and other counties, capturing many. The highway between Jincheng and Gaoping was completely destroyed. In addition, the Japanese army has gathered more than 4,000 troops from various counties in southern Fen and launched a large-scale offensive on Jiwang Mountain. After the Chinese army bravely encircled and attacked them in a bloody battle for four days and nights, they killed more than a thousand and recovered many strongholds. The defeated Japanese fled in different directions, and the pursuit is still fiercely underway. As for the Chinese army in eastern Henan, the mopping-up operation against the remnants of the Japanese army on the border between Henan and Anhui has also been very successful. Countless weapons, ammunition, and supplies have been seized.

Shandong and Jiangsu

The Japanese army in Shandong was extremely panicked after Zhao Yikang led more than 5,000 troops to defect. In order to prevent a large-scale offensive by the Chinese army, they gathered more than 1,000 infantry, cavalry, and artillery and invaded south along the Anju Highway from Weixian via Anqiu. They were met with a head-on blow by the Chinese army, killing many Japanese. At the moment, the Chinese army is fiercely attacking on one side and advancing towards the rear of the Japanese army on the other, carrying out a pincer attack. There have also been battles in Boshan, Yangning, Laiwu, and other places, where the Japanese army has suffered heavy losses. The battles in northern Jiangsu are more intense in Huaian, Huaiyin, Baoying, and other places. Under the head-on blow of the Chinese army, the invading Japanese troops on all fronts have been surrounded separately, and a heroic annihilation battle is underway. In addition:

Guangxi

The Chinese army has launched fierce attacks on the Japanese troops on the Yongqin and Yonglong routes, killing many. In Shenzhen in southern Guangdong and Qiongan in eastern Guangdong, the Japanese army has launched incessant offensives but has been repulsed, abandoning many corpses, weapons, and ammunition.

Central Anhui

The Japanese launched a large-scale invasion of Wuwei and were encircled and fiercely attacked by China, killing more than a thousand Japanese.

### Axis Powers Launch Preemptive Balkan Policy Before Launching Offensive Against Britain – Maintain Peace to Obtain Economic Benefits – Soviet Union Concerned About Future Developments – Rumor that Deployment of Part of German Army to East Border Has Unclear Intentions

London – Nothing is yet known about the scope or nature of the talks in Berchtesgaden and Rome. However, according to a Reuter's diplomatic correspondent, all current indications are that Germany intends to improve understanding between Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria to increase economic output, especially to achieve political peace so that Germany can concentrate its efforts on the Western war and develop plans for exploiting the occupied areas without any worries about the rear. The gradual rapprochement between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union is a notable fact in recent times. The Soviet Union's attitude towards the above developments is still unclear. It can be asserted that any German action to gain a foothold in the Black Sea will immediately provoke Soviet opposition. However, at present, the Soviet Union seems unlikely to take any action other than paying very close attention to the Axis powers' actions to maintain peace and promote their economic interests in the Balkans. (Reuter's dispatch, 28th)

Bucharest – Local well-informed sources stated yesterday that the increasing friction between Germany and the Soviet Union in the Balkans is very reliable. Local reports confirm that German troops are now being transported by ships to the German New Eastern Front, which borders the Soviet Union. An official newspaper published an order yesterday stating that former Romanian Foreign Minister Gavencu has been appointed as the envoy to the Soviet Union and will arrive in Moscow on August 10. Gavencu's appointment is considered quite important because the Balkan Conference is currently being held in Salzburg and Rome. It is believed that Gavencu will bring Hitler's reorganization plan for the economy and politics of Southeastern Europe to Moscow. According to United Press International sources from Soviet personnel, the final border allocation between Germany and the Soviet Union will be completed before embassies are exchanged between Berlin, Rome, Moscow, and Bucharest. German commentators on the movement of German troops said that the movement of German troops to the east border has not reached the level of concentration. They did not pay great attention to this movement, but said that they should place the troops used in the Belgian and French battles in new camps. At the same time, reliable sources said that the Minister of Interior has issued a notice ordering the Jews who withdrew from Bessarabia due to the Soviet Union's entry to return to the area within five days. It is believed that this notice is suddenly used for wealthy Jewish people who escaped in cars when the Soviet army entered. It is believed that the government has decided to detain more than 200 Jewish people and communists in the Mălăncrav concentration camp for national security reasons. The camp was previously a detention center for Iron Guard leaders. (United Press dispatch, 28th)

Berlin – Political figures here are very interested in the negotiations in Salzburg. However, official figures are absolutely silent because diplomatic authorities are all in southern Germany. Newspapers believe that Germany's interests in the Balkan Peninsula are purely economic and hope that Southeastern Europe will maintain peace. A diplomatic correspondent for the "People's Observer" stated that the Balkan countries should now build a new order and maintain a stable state to establish a foundation for prosperity. The countries must obtain a stable political position and a sound economic position in the New Europe. The "General Report" stated that Western European countries hope that the Southeastern European countries will become a source of unrest, while Germany and Italy wish that the Southeastern European countries maintain peace and resolve all disputes based on justice and common sense. The "Berlin Local Daily" stated that political peace is a prerequisite for maintaining Germany's economic relations with the Southeastern European countries. (Haitong dispatch, 28th)

German, Bulgarian, Italian, and Romanian Talks Conclude – Romania Will Eventually Cede Territory to Bulgaria and Hungary

London – There has been intense diplomatic activity in Berchtesgaden, Salzburg, and Rome in the past 24 hours. It is expected that the result will be that Romania will cede Outer Transylvania to Hungary and part of Dobruja to Bulgaria. After Hitler spoke with the Romanian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister on Friday afternoon, he met with the Hungarian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister at his country residence for more than two hours last night. At the same time, in Rome, Mussolini received the Romanian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister at the Venezia Palace. Italian Foreign Minister Ciano was also present. The talks lasted more than an hour and a half. The Romanian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister left Rome at 11:00 last night and returned home. People in Berlin and Rome firmly believe that the result of these talks will be that Romania will cede Outer Transylvania and part of Dobruja. (Reuter's dispatch, 28th)

Berchtesgaden – Yesterday afternoon, Hitler received Bulgarian Prime Minister Filov and Foreign Minister Popov. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop was also present. The issue of the New Order in Southeastern Europe was discussed for about two hours in the same place where he had talked with Romanian politicians the previous day. According to Bulgarian newspapers, Bulgaria proposed to Hitler that Romania return Southern Dobruja, which was annexed in 1913. Although the details of the talks are unknown, well-informed sources said that the discussion was completely in the spirit of friendship, which Germany and Bulgaria have maintained since the World War. Afterwards, a tea party was held, and the Bulgarian Prime Minister introduced his entourage to Mr. Hitler. While Ribbentrop was talking with Mr. Hitler, the Bulgarian Prime Minister, accompanied by the Bulgarian envoy to Germany, the director of the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the German envoy to Bulgaria, drove to Salzburg. The Bulgarian Prime Minister and others left here at 7:30 last night and returned to Sofia via Vienna. (Haitong dispatch, 28th)

Berlin – Yesterday, the Essen National Daily published an article criticizing the visit of politicians from the Balkan countries to Germany, stating that the German side deeply sympathizes with the requests of Hungary, Bulgaria, and Turkey to modify their territories because the requests are very reasonable. Southern Dobruja was originally an important area for Bulgaria's livelihood. As for Hungary, it must give up some of its hopes because the land disputed by Hungary and Romania is far greater than that disputed by Bulgaria and Romania. In addition, the historical development should also impose considerable restrictions on Hungary's requests. At present, it is an era of self-determination for minorities and cannot be compared with the ancient concepts of empires. Hungary knows that it must retreat, and Romania also knows that it has been unfair to Hungary. Therefore, in order to maintain peace between the two countries, both sides must make concessions to each other. (Haitong dispatch, 28th)

### British Aircraft Demonstrate Power Day and Night by Flying Over Germany – Successful Attacks on Military Targets – German Aircraft also Bombard the British Coastline

London – British aircraft demonstrated their amazing striking power again yesterday, flying over German military targets day and night in adverse weather. The cities of Sheeble and Valhaven in the Netherlands, Cherbourg and Saint-Nazaire and South End in France, and Dortmund and Hamm in Germany all heard the sound of British aircraft and were accurately bombed. According to the Information Office of the Ministry of Aviation, the White Han-style aircraft of the Coastal Command flew to Cherbourg in adverse weather and dropped many giant bombs and incendiary bombs on the German oil depot. The oil depot was hit and caught fire. A large British bomber also flew to the mouth of the Loire River to bomb the oil refinery and oil storage depot controlled by the Germans, causing heavy damage. The main targets of the British aircraft were five oil refineries and oil storage depots in South End and three oil storage tanks in Saint-Nazaire, with a total storage capacity of 142,000 tons. Targets in both places were found by British aircraft shortly after midnight. Ground defenses strongly resisted. The British aircraft dropped tons of high-explosive bombs and hundreds of small incendiary bombs in batches, hitting the targets and exploding successively. Only black smoke and fierce fires were seen. Other British bombers attacked the Hamm railway line and important power stations again. The power stations in Dortmund and the airfields in Sheeble and Valhaven were also bombed. Yesterday, British aircraft attacked during the day without any losses, but one night raider did not return. In addition, a coastal aircraft bombed a German supply ship off the coast of Norway yesterday and saw the crew abandoning ship. (Reuter's dispatch, 28th)

### Churchill to Deliver Speech Reporting on the International Situation - Britain Seeks Closer Ties with the Soviet Union to Resist German Influence in Europe

London: There is a strong possibility that the upcoming foreign policy debate in the House of Commons will be changed from closed-door to open. According to Reuters' parliamentary correspondent, the government will leave the decision to the House. Prime Minister Churchill will deliver a speech during the debate, his first on foreign policy since taking office. Before the substantive debate, the House will hear an important statement from Economic Warfare Minister Dalton on new methods planned to make the blockade more effective. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)

London: The House of Commons is scheduled to hold a closed-door session on the 30th of this month to discuss foreign policy issues. Prime Minister Churchill will deliver a comprehensive speech at that time, providing a detailed report on recent developments in the international situation. It has been observed that Chancellor Hitler's planned "offensive" against Britain has evidently slowed down, and diplomatic authorities in various European countries have been very active over the past week. Therefore, political observers here are placing great importance on the upcoming closed-door session of the House of Commons, believing that a detailed review of the "political dynamics in Southeast European countries" will be conducted. Furthermore, one matter is particularly noteworthy: recently, Britain has shown increasing favor towards the Soviet Union. This is a crucial factor in world politics. For example, regarding Bulgaria's demand to Romania for the return of the Dobruja region, Britain and the Soviet Union have "identical views" and are supporting Bulgaria. This clearly demonstrates Britain's eagerness to get closer to the Soviet Union in order to resist Germany's efforts in Southeast Europe. In addition, British officials insist that recent diplomatic activities in various European countries are completely unrelated to Hitler's recent "peace appeals" and should not be confused.

### Britain Protests Romania's Recent Measures - Considering them detrimental to British Interests

London: According to Reuters, Britain is protesting against the recent actions of the Romanian government. It is said that the protest note will be delivered in Bucharest today. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)

London: According to sources in London, the British government is very dissatisfied with the actions of the Romanian government and is considering lodging a formal protest. The Romanian government has taken several measures intended to harm British interests in Romania, such as restricting the movement of British ships on the Danube, expelling British technicians from Romania, and interfering with the administration of the Astra Romana oil company, thereby seriously damaging British oil interests. At the same time, the British government reserves the freedom to take measures it deems appropriate to retaliate against the Romanian government's actions, such as the detention of three Romanian ships in the Mediterranean. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)

### Bessarabians Return to Their Homeland - Romania No Longer Obstructing - End of Negotiations with the Soviet Union

Moscow: In light of the recent acts of violence by the Romanian authorities in obstructing the return of Bessarabian people to their homeland, the Secretary-General of the Soviet People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, Suboralov, sent a note to the Romanian Minister, David, on the 13th, listing the acts of violence committed by the Romanian authorities against the Bessarabian people and requesting that the Romanian government immediately take the necessary measures to prevent such incidents from recurring. At the same time, it must guarantee the safe return of Bessarabians to their homeland.

On the 21st, the Romanian Foreign Ministry sent a reply to the Soviet Minister, confirming that certain sections of the Soviet note were true, while other issues were still under investigation. According to reports, as of July 26, 149,974 people had returned to Bessarabia from Romania, and the evacuation is still continuing. (TASS dispatch, 27th)

Madrid: At 2:30 a.m. yesterday, several aircraft of unknown nationality bombed Gibraltar again. Anti-aircraft guns and searchlights were immediately activated, but no aircraft were shot down. The bombing was intense. (Haitong dispatch, 28th)

La Linea: It is reported that Gibraltar resumed evacuations yesterday morning. Three ships have successively transported 3,013 residents. The rapid withdrawal of the British from this key point was due to the attacks by German and Italian aircraft on Thursday and Friday evenings.

### Pan-American Small Group Committee - Unanimously Drafts Agreement - Reaffirms Right to Self-Determination of Western Hemisphere Territories - Submitted to the Committee for the Maintenance of Peace for Approval

Havana: The small group committee composed of representatives from the United States, Cuba, Argentina, Brazil, and Panama at the Pan-American Conference has reached an agreement after much discussion and drafted an agreement to be submitted to the Committee for the Maintenance of Peace for approval. The agreement reiterates the right to self-determination of European countries in the Western Hemisphere and declares that the American republics have the right to prevent possible transfers of such land to other countries in order to protect their own nations. It is said that the agreement also contains a convention and regulations for establishing an agency to put the "Havana Declaration" into effect, and a resolution to establish an emergency committee to deal with any situation that may arise before the permanent agency is established. The agreement first focuses on the proposal put forward by the United States regarding the custody of such territories, and contains the demands put forward by Argentina, advocating that any action on any colony should first be discussed with the people of that territory. It also lists the proposals put forward by Brazil and Cuba, advocating the establishment of an agency so that any colony can take immediate action if there is a risk of transfer to another country. The convention referred to must be approved by the parliaments of several countries in accordance with their constitutions. The Falkland Islands are not recognized as having colonial status, so they are not handled in accordance with the joint custody system for other colonies. Argentina has requested special rights to the Falkland Islands. The Neutrality Committee of the Conference yesterday passed a resolution proposed by the United States to prevent the activities of the Fifth Column, which stipulates the exchange of information on destructive activities, restricts the rights of diplomatic envoys, and does not allow foreign embassies to have a large number of staff or officials with diplomatic status. If the sovereignty of any country is threatened by such destructive activities, and the government of that country applies for assistance, then all countries should take joint action. The Committee for the Maintenance of Peace has agreed that if the 21 republics have not yet made a decision on the convention, a standing committee should be organized by the five American countries to guide all actions taken to implement the custody of threatened colonies of European countries in the Americas. This is one of the key points of contention, as several countries have argued that the committee should be composed of representatives from 21 countries. The three-point procedure aimed at avoiding the transfer of colonies will be approved by the Committee for the Maintenance of Peace at its next plenary session. It is now believed that the proposal put forward by Uruguay to limit the territorial waters to 25 miles is expected to pass. The plan will be implemented after this war. The current international law stipulates a territorial waters limit of only three miles. The proposal put forward by Guatemala, arguing that if the United Kingdom makes any changes to the legal status of British Honduras, then Guatemala should take over the administrative power of the territory, is currently being considered by the Committee for the Maintenance of Peace. It stipulates that Guatemala should continue to govern the territory until it returns to normal. Honduras argues that the colony should be considered by an arbitration court. The Guatemala proposal has not yet been put to a vote, but according to responsible sources here, British Honduras will be included in the general action plan for all colonies. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)

Havana: Dr. Miro, the Argentine representative at the Pan-American Conference, has fully endorsed the plan to prevent countries in the Western Hemisphere from being transferred to others as a result of the European war. This undertaking has been confirmed by U.S. Secretary of State Hull yesterday. This is the greatest victory of American diplomacy in recent times, as the plan created by Washington's strategists seems to have been accepted by the American republics. Although the details of the colonial plan have not been revealed, it is said to be very similar to the Pan-American joint control proposed by the United States for any colony in distress. When the Argentine representative announced his satisfaction, an optimistic atmosphere filled the conference. People generally hope that the conference can quickly implement this procedure to its completion, so that the Western Hemisphere has a detailed and practical procedure to resist totalitarian countries. (International dispatch, 28th)

Washington: U.S. Acting Secretary of State Welles told reporters yesterday that the United States has not received a request from the French government for the United States to declare its attitude towards French territories in the Western Hemisphere, especially if French colonies are attacked by non-American powers. Welles said that the U.S. policy regarding European countries' territories in the Western Hemisphere is well known and has recently been clarified again. He believes that it is unnecessary for France to make a request to the United States. Welles said in response to questions that he has discussed the general issues of French territories, including Martinique, with the French ambassador on several occasions, but they have no intention of making any further statements at this time. (United Press dispatch, 28th)

### Nine British Nationals Arrested in Japan - No Announcement from Japanese Authorities After Cox's Detention

Local News: According to Reuters, nine more British nationals were arrested in Japan at the end of last week. Together with Cox, the agency's Tokyo correspondent who was arrested yesterday, there are now ten people. The names of the nine people are as follows: (1) Colonel James, representative of the British Industrial Federation in Japan (Tokyo); (2) Holt, President of the British Association (Kobe); (3) Truman of Fretcher Company (Kobe); (4) James of Cameron Company (Kobe); (5) Jones of Nickel Lyon Company (Kobe); (6) British merchant and Honorary Consul of Greece, Macnorton (Osaka); (7) James of Nickel Lyon Company (Osaka); (8) Lindger (Shimonoseki); (9) Lindger (Nagasaki, brother of the above-mentioned Lin Min). News of the arrests of all the above-mentioned people has not been allowed to be published in Japanese newspapers and is forbidden from being transmitted overseas. It is said that these arrests were carried out simultaneously in various parts of Japan, so this unexpected incident appears to be an organized action. (Reuters) Local News: Reuters has learned that, as of yesterday afternoon, there has been no announcement from the Japanese authorities regarding the detention of the agency's Tokyo correspondent, Cox, by the Japanese military police. It is also not allowed to send telegrams from Japan about this matter. It is said that staff from the British consulate in Tokyo visited Cox the day before yesterday afternoon, but permission was not granted. However, he was provided with adequate food. Reuters in Shanghai has received many letters and telegrams expressing sympathy for Cox's detention. Most of them were sent by people who knew Cox, who all said that Cox was upright and honest and that this detention must be due to a misunderstanding. (Reuters)

### Contents of the Resignation Letter of the Secretary-General of the League of Nations

Geneva: Part of the resignation letter of former League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol was revealed today. Avenol stated that until September 1939, he still believed that the League of Nations could at least carry out minimal activities. Unfortunately, the position of the League of Nations was declining day by day. He suggested establishing an economic and social issues committee, and stated that non-members of the League of Nations could also cooperate with the committee, but his plan was not successful. Therefore, the activities of the Secretariat of the League of Nations had to take into account the reduction of the League of Nations' economic power and seek ways to adapt to it. The General Assembly of the League of Nations allowed him to make flexible arrangements, but his efforts had no support, so he submitted his resignation. (Haitong dispatch, 28th)

### German Military Report for One Week - German Submarine Activities - British Shipping Feels Threatened

Berlin: During this week, the world paid attention to Hitler's speech on July 19 and its repercussions. Britain has now declared that it wants to continue the war, but it cannot be said that the outcome of the war is favorable to Britain. Britain has admitted the possibility of German troops landing on the British Isles and told the world that a kind of Maginot Line and solid gun emplacements have been built along the coast, but we know that this cannot be built in a few weeks. The number of British troops on the island is also limited. The last time British troops came to France, there were only ten divisions, and their artillery and tanks were the best, but they were abandoned on the battlefield when they fled back. It is not easy to replenish these armaments now, and it is difficult for the frightened army to restore its combat power. It is a big mistake to think that time is on Britain's side. Germany is getting stronger every day, and Britain is gradually weakening due to the German blockade. The tonnage lost by British ships every day is about 30,000 tons. The number reached 95,000 tons on July 25. The record of one million tons during the World War will soon be reached. Britain now has to lay mines in the waterways of the Thumberston and St. George's Channel and use the sea line of Northern Ireland to connect the seaports of the Irish Sea. The British Navy has lost about 40% of its ships, so its Far East fleet has to be recalled. Only a small part of the escort ships are available, and most of them must be prepared for the final decisive battle. The situation of the British Navy in the Mediterranean is even worse. French ports are no longer used by Britain. Malta is attacked by Italy every day. Gibraltar and Haifa ports have been heavily bombed. It is even more unbelievable if Britain declares that the counter-offensive is ready, because the problem of the British supreme commander has not yet been resolved.

Berlin: According to a military expert who gave a supplementary war report to a Haitong agency reporter, German submarines sank 65,000 tons of enemy ships. British merchant ships have suffered many losses recently, and the supply of food and raw materials is becoming increasingly difficult. Transport ships have to travel a long way, so they feel even more lacking. The German Air Force continues to bomb in bad weather, and the oil storage facilities at the mouth of the Thames River have also been attacked. (Haitong dispatch, 28th)

Berlin: According to Haitong Agency reporter, Rear Admiral Burke Fefe stated that there are currently three facts about the naval situation: (1) Although Britain has suffered heavy losses, it continues to use warships to escort transport ships in the Strait of Dover; (2) German small submarines have been constantly victorious in commercial warfare; (3) Britain has blockaded St. George's Channel and Bristol Channel. Although Britain has suffered heavy losses in the ports of the southern coast and the Thames River, it still sends fleets to escort transport ships there instead of diverting to the western coast. There are three reasons for this: (a) According to the statistics of 1937, the import and export goods of the Thames ports reached 32,000,000 tons, while Southampton reached 13,800,000 tons, and Laithers reached 6,100,000 tons, totaling 20,000,000 tons, accounting for 44% of the total trade of all British seaports. Such a huge amount of goods cannot be transferred to other ports at will, as there is a lack of sufficient loading and unloading equipment. (b) Goods passing through a long distance must have special storage methods. This is most convenient in the Thames River port recently. (c) Due to the distribution of the British population, the consumption of daily necessities must also be more convenient through certain routes. The Qin River port is also one of the most convenient routes. Secondly, the greatest victory of German submarines in commercial warfare can be seen from the feat of sinking 160,000 tons of British ships with seven submarines. The third point is that after the British government closed the St. George's Channel and Bristol Channel, the shipping in the Irish Sea can only come from Northern Ireland. (Haitong dispatch, 28th)

### Willkie Prepares to Compete with the Democratic Party

Atlanta: Republican presidential candidate Willkie declared yesterday that he intends to launch a competition against the Democratic Party in the South. This statement is sufficient to indicate that the Republican Party will engage in a presidential competition with the Democratic Party in Dixie, something only seen since 1928. "Supporting Willkie" clubs have sprung up everywhere in South Africa. It is certain that Willkie will make a trip to the South. The leaders of the clubs supporting Willkie were all established suddenly at the end of the Democratic National Convention. The leaders of the clubs supporting Willkie from Florida to Louisiana are all fiercely opposed to the Democratic Party. (United Press dispatch, 28th)

### Developing Kaiyuan

Kunming Correspondence: Kaiyuan, formerly known as Ami Prefecture in the Qing Dynasty, is located at the center of the Chinese section of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. Anyone entering or leaving Yunnan must pass through this place. Because the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway does not operate at night, passengers taking slow trains all disembark here to stay overnight. As a result, merchants gather, and the market is prosperous, truly making it an important town in southern Yunnan. Recently, the number of overseas Chinese returning to China has been increasing daily. The Yunnan Provincial Government has designated Kaiyuan as one of the overseas Chinese settlement areas. Kaiyuan has fertile land, abundant resources, and a subtropical climate. If the returning overseas Chinese can work diligently and in a pioneering spirit to develop it, its future is immeasurable. However, overseas Chinese have been abroad for a long time and have become somewhat estranged from the interior. Moreover, Kaiyuan is remotely located in southern Yunnan and has not been noticed by people, so few dare to come rashly. I am writing a general overview of the area for reference, which may provide some help to those who aspire to come to Yunnan for cultivation.

Waiting to be Developed

After getting off the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway train, you arrive at Luoyunzhuang, a town outside the county seat. The streets are clean and tidy, with trees lining both sides. There are hotels opened by Cantonese people, such as Guangfulong Inn and Dadong Inn. Other small department stores and Cantonese goods stores are also operated by Cantonese people. There are also several Western restaurants, mostly opened by Annamese people, who also speak Cantonese. Near the station, there is a hotel opened by the French, but the accommodation costs are calculated in Vietnamese currency, which is uneconomical. Traveling north for a little over a mile, you reach the county seat. The streets inside the city are relatively poor. In terms of education, in addition to the county-run schools, there are the provincial Kaiyuan Agricultural School and the Public Education Center. The location is quiet, and the decorations are colorful, leaving visitors with a good impression.

Propagating

Kaiyuan County as a whole is rectangular in shape. The Yunnan-Vietnam Railway runs vertically through the center of the plain, dividing Kaiyuan into eastern and western parts. The county's area extends approximately 130 kilometers from south to north and is about 90 kilometers wide from east to west. The central part is a plain, while the southeastern part is mostly mountainous, especially the eastern part. The plains of the entire county are separated by the eastern mountains, causing differences in climate. The highest mountain is Dongshan. To its east is the Jiayiba Plain, bordering Wenshan County, with 150,000 mu of arable land. However, only slightly more than 50,000 mu have been cultivated. Jiayiba is further divided into Dajiayi and Xiaojiayi. The soil is fertile, but unfortunately, water conservancy was not properly maintained in the past, so land yields cannot be compared with other places. The Yunnan Department of Finance has now established the "Kaiwen Reclamation Bureau" there to construct water conservancy projects and guide the public in reclamation efforts. Once the water conservancy of Jiayiba is improved, all the fields can be irrigated. This area alone can reclaim 100,000 to 150,000 mu of good farmland.

Repairing Water Conservancy

The fields of Jiayiba can be planted twice a year, with broad beans in the spring and rice in the summer. The soil in the central part of the plain has more moisture and is suitable for planting sugarcane. Therefore, the sugar produced there is abundant in yield and excellent in quality, surpassing the entire county. The Kaiwen Reclamation Bureau plans to build a dam at Guanyin Temple in the short term to store water for irrigation. The first phase will reclaim 40,000 mu, followed by two more phases to turn all the public and private wasteland into cultivated land. To the west of the mountains is the Wucheng Plain, with a slightly warmer climate than the eastern part, and the water conservancy is also better than the eastern plain. However, only the Xiba River irrigates all the fields. The river's capacity is not large, and the construction is not strong, so there is always the danger of collapse. However, nothing seems to be wrong at the moment. The wise authorities have probably already noticed and may undertake repairs in the future. The entire county currently has about 500,000 mu of arable land, with mountainous land accounting for about one-third, and the rest being fertile land in the plains. Due to water conservancy issues, only one-fifth has been cultivated, so water conservancy is crucial for the county. The county's political divisions consist of six districts and two towns, with an estimated population of over 10,000 households. According to a survey by the county government at the end of 1939, there are approximately 100,000 male and female residents. Apart from the area near the county seat, the vicinity of Dongshan is mostly inhabited by a mix of Miao and Yi people, with extremely complex ethnic groups, including White Miao, Minjia, Bai Yi, and Yeren, among others. The customs near the county seat are simple and honest. Kaiyuan has abundant labor and is still diligent and hardworking. The daily wage for each worker is about 80 cents in national currency, which is much cheaper than in Kunming.

Abundant Products

Kaiyuan is located in southern Yunnan, with a climate almost subtropical. Rainfall is abundant, with no snow throughout the year, and very little frost. The climate remains warm in winter, making it suitable for various crops, and the yields are abundant. For example, the yield per mu in the Jiayi Plain is no less than that of the top-grade fields in Yiliang County, a rich producing area of Yunnan Province. Furthermore, due to weather conditions, crops that are not suitable for planting in other prefectures and counties, such as tropical bananas, kapok, soybeans, and sugarcane, can also be planted in this county, and the yields are particularly abundant, unmatched elsewhere. Taking sugarcane as an example, the output from the Buyanba district alone is equal to the output of any other county. According to tax bureau statistics, the annual income from sugar sales in this district is approximately 2.9 million national currency. Farmers are often poor, partly due to a lack of capital and partly due to adherence to old methods, resulting in poor quality products. If improvements can be made, the production and sales are immeasurable.

Developed Cotton Industry

In addition to agricultural products, there are also abundant deposits of coal and iron. Digging into the soil reveals them. The quality and abundance are unmatched elsewhere. However, the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway has high freight rates and inconvenient transportation. Therefore, apart from supplying neighboring counties for fuel, it is not possible to transport and sell them in large quantities. It should be known that goods are abandoned on the ground due to the lack of transportation methods, ultimately being left unused. If funds can be raised for large-scale transportation and sales, it will also be a profitable business. Other agricultural products such as rice, potatoes, tobacco, fava beans, and cotton are also abundant in the county. Cotton accounts for one-seventh of the total in Yunnan Province. According to last year's survey, the province's cotton production was 6 million catties, with the county producing over 800,000 catties. In addition, there is also kapok, a specialty of the county. In the past, farmers did not pay attention to it, and very little was planted. Two years ago, under the advocacy of cotton experts, it began to attract the attention of cotton farmers. Now, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Fudian Bank have jointly organized a loan group to provide loans to cotton farmers and encourage planting, so that this special resource can be developed for production. There are already 1,175 mu of kapok planted in Kaiyuan. Further expansion in the future will be a great source of wealth. It is expected that in the near future, the cotton industry in Kaiyuan will have greater development. In addition to this, there are several types of handicrafts, such as weaving and noodles. Since the operators are all small-scale, they have not been able to fully develop. Animal husbandry and weaving straw mats are well-known rural side occupations in the county. If investments are made for large-scale production, the future is also promising.

Establishing a Large Power Plant

Because the county is centrally located and rich in production, the Yunnan Provincial Department of Finance, to develop the county and strengthen the rear, has raised funds to establish a power plant for the Yunnan Mining Company. Construction began three years ago and is nearing completion, making it one of Yunnan Province's major projects. The plant is located near a certain place and uses a certain river water as power. Once completed, it can generate 10,000 kilowatts, which will supply electricity for the mining of Gejiu tin mines and smelting by the mining company. The surplus electricity will be used for lighting in Kaiyuan, and the rest will be used for burning and refining cement and coal. Therefore, before the hydroelectric power plant is completed, the Department of Finance plans to build a cement plant and a coal plant near a certain place. This great project can not only absorb the labor force in the rear but also recover many concessions and reduce the outflow of foreign exchange. Kaiyuan is indeed a place extremely suitable for investment and development. Overseas Chinese who are interested in returning to China to start businesses may wish to visit and investigate, pool capital, and engage in development. This will not only benefit individuals but also greatly benefit the country.

Moscow, this morning at 8:08 (Moscow time), Soviet female pilots Nastorenko, Mikhailova, and Rosagova, departed from Boli on the "Ukraine" aircraft for a non-stop flight from Boli to Lvov. General Stan and Zihalev were present to see them off. At 5:32 PM, the aircraft passed Dashi (Eastern Siberia), and at 8:20 PM, it reached 150 kilometers north of Novosbirsk. The aircraft is still in radio contact with us. After passing Dashi, the aircraft began its night flight. Currently, the crew is safe, and everything is going smoothly. Another telegram: At 1:00 AM on the 28th, the aircraft approached Sverdlovsk. The aircraft has no damage. (TASS telegram on the 27th)

### Soviet Female Pilots Fly Non-Stop Chongqing's Air Defense Air Raid Alarms are Deep Air Raid Shelters are Warm in Winter and Cool in Summer

Chongqing Correspondence: Air raids in Chongqing often occur at night. According to reports, the loss rate for Japanese aircraft during daytime air raids is about 4%, while it is only about 1.6% at night. Approximately from the 7th or 8th to the 22nd or 23rd, it is the period of night raids, especially around the middle of the month.

Before an air raid alarm, officials often release news that Japanese aircraft have reached Yichang or Wanxian, which is called "news." After the news is released, women and children rush to carry clothes and anti-air raid stools (canvas stools used by cobblers), fleeing to nearby air raid shelters. Now, the Air Defense Command raises a red ball high up as soon as there is news. During an air raid alarm, another ball is added. During an emergency alarm, both balls are removed. During an emergency alarm, if the enemy aircraft are still far away, one ball is hung up. If they are even farther away, two balls are hung up. As they approach, one ball is removed. As they get closer, the other ball is also removed. When the alarm is lifted, a green ball is hung up.

Chongqing is a natural air defense city. The city is full of high mountains. Now, all the air raid shelters can almost accommodate the entire city's population. During air raids, anyone caught stealing will be shot, so property is very safe.

Outside the air raid shelters, there are often two or three vendors selling peanuts, boiled water, and Liangfen (mung bean jelly). There are also vendors selling loquats and apricots.

Poor people who seek shelter in the shelters bring bedding to use as pillows when sleeping in the shelters. Those who are slightly wealthier also bring small suitcases. The children in the shelters mostly do not sleep or cry, probably because they understand the seriousness of the situation and have experienced it many times.

Inside the air raid shelters, there are two rows of wooden benches on both sides. The empty space in the middle can accommodate two people standing side by side. The air is quite fresh, and it is warm in winter and cool in summer. Women, children, and timid men often rush in to grab seats after an air raid alarm. People who arrive calmly after an emergency alarm often sit on the stone steps outside the shelter because the lights illuminating the path inside the entrance have been turned off.

Inside the shelter, some people are dozing or sleeping. Only a few oil lamps are lit in the shelter. Some students are reading with a candle. This could earn them the nickname "Air Raid Scholar." There are also people reading during daytime air raids in the shelter. Therefore, Chongqing's experience with air raid alarms is very deep. It can truly be said that they have "personally experienced a hundred alarms."

### Based on Agreement and Legal Principles, Shanghai Courts Cannot be Changed Concessions are Internationally Neutral Zones, Courts are Not Permitted by the Situation

The agreement to establish Chinese courts in the Public Concession is based on the agreement signed on February 17, 1930, by the Chinese representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the ministers of Brazil, the United States, Britain, Norway, the Netherlands, and France. It has the nature of a treaty. Without negotiation by national representatives, this agreement cannot be changed. Recently, certain parties have been actively attempting to seize the Chinese courts established in the concession. According to Japanese spokesman Ken Tsurumi, "The court issue will have new developments in the near future." A reporter from the Heiminsha News Agency immediately inquired with a jurist about this matter. According to his opinion:

Not an Occupied Area, No Right to Proceed

The negotiation of this matter should be conducted by the Minister of Foreign Affairs representing the country and the ministers of the countries that signed the agreement in order to be effective. Although the Japanese army has temporarily occupied the outskirts of Shanghai militarily, the concession is an internationally neutral zone and cannot be regarded as an occupied area. The Japanese army cannot conduct negotiations. The Nanjing organization has not only not been recognized by various countries, but Japan has not yet recognized it, and it has no standing to conduct negotiations. The Japanese spokesman's so-called "new developments in the near future," it is not known how it will proceed or on what legal principles.

Treaty Obligations Should be Observed

Even if we step back and say that a certain party is conducting negotiations with various governments or with representatives of other countries, Britain and the United States are among the countries that signed the Nine-Power Treaty. They should steadfastly uphold the integrity of China's land sovereignty. Moreover, since China's war of resistance, they have consistently stated that their Far East policy remains unchanged. Before the Nine-Power Treaty expires, they cannot fail to abide by treaty obligations and undermine their credibility by changing the Chinese courts established according to the agreement without the consent of the Chinese government. Moreover, the British and American ambassadors have not heard of this matter. Therefore, the ambitions of the Japanese puppets to covet the Chinese courts in the concession will ultimately come to naught.

### Gas Company Strike Prolonged Affecting Industry Hot Water Bottle Factories to Negotiate Rumors of Strike Being Mediated

Following the strike at the British-owned Gas Company, yesterday several hot water bottle factories were affected by insufficient gas supply, impacting their business. Manufacturing hot water bottle liners requires gas. Since the strike began, although the company has hired a large number of White Russian strikebreakers, their lack of skill has reduced the gas supply. As a result, several factories have also reduced their work efficiency, suffering significant losses. Yesterday afternoon, several hot water bottle factories held a meeting to discuss measures to negotiate with the company. The Shanghai Municipal Council's Chinese directors, Yu Qiaqing and Xi Yushu, recognizing that gas is a public utility and to prevent labor disputes from escalating, are rumored to meet with Chairman Cadell at the company's office on Jiangxi Road this morning.

### Domestic Tea Exports Certificates Issued by China Tea Company

Without Submitting to Provincial Government for Approval In the past, the export of domestic tea from various provinces required approval from the provincial government. Now, the Zhejiang Provincial Government, based on the general outline of the Ministry of Finance's regulations for managing domestic tea, stipulates that after domestic tea is inspected, the China Tea Company will issue a transportation certificate. The provincial governments and customs offices along the way will verify the certificate for release. Therefore, domestic tea will no longer be approved by the provincial government in the future but will be directly issued certificates by the China Tea Company for export. The purchase, transportation, and sale of export tea will still be carried out according to the regulations of the Ministry without any changes.

### National Government Supplements Military Needs Issuing Military Needs Bonds Fixed Amount of 1.2 Billion National Currency

The National Government is issuing the 1940 Military Needs Bonds to supplement military needs. The regulations are summarized as follows: Article 1: The National Government is issuing public bonds to supplement military needs, named the 1940 Military Needs Bonds. Article 2: The total amount of these bonds is 1.2 billion national currency, to be issued in two phases, with 600 million yuan issued on March 1, 1940, and September 1, 1940, each issued at 94% of face value.

Article 3: The interest rate on these bonds is set at 6% per annum, with interest paid twice every six months. Article 4: These bonds will only pay interest for the first two years from the date of issuance. Principal repayment will begin in 1943, to be repaid in twenty-five years, with drawings for principal repayment every six months, each time repaying the amount according to the principal and interest repayment schedule. Article 5: The repayment of principal and interest on these bonds will be allocated monthly by the Ministry of Finance from the national treasury revenue according to the principal and interest repayment schedule for reserve payment by the Central Bank. Article 6: These bonds

Principal and Interest Repayment

Article 9: Those who forge these bonds or damage their credit will be punished by judicial organs according to law.

### Cai Guohua's Home Suddenly Raided by Thugs Xi Yuliang Shot Cai Himself Injured in a Fall Both Sent to Hospital for Treatment, Lives Not in Danger

On Route Tenant in the French Concession, at about 10:00 PM on the night before last (27th), thugs broke into a residence at night and opened fire, shooting Xi Yuliang in the left ear. The bullet grazed his face. His younger brother, Delin, happened to be sitting with him and was unharmed. His brother-in-law, Cai Guohua, was wiping himself upstairs when he suddenly heard gunfire downstairs and cries for help. He rushed out from his room, intending to climb down the wall, but accidentally slipped and fell onto the glass skylight of No. 1 Fuxianfang Lane, causing severe lacerations to his legs and buttocks by the glass. The assailants then fled out the door. The details are as follows:

Severed Ties, Suicide Note Left

No. 403 Route Tenant is a detached Western-style small house along the road. The owner is Cai Guohua, also known as Dianrong, a native of Nantong, 37 years old. He graduated from Jinling University in Nanjing and later studied land administration at the University of Michigan in the United States, earning a master's degree. Before the war, he served as a section chief in the Civil Affairs Department of Zhejiang Province for three years. After resigning, he brought his family to Shanghai, temporarily living as a recluse. Due to circumstances, he rarely went out and spent his time translating books as a pastime. This summer, he was hired as a Chinese professor at the National Shanghai Medical College. The appointment letter was just issued a few days ago.

Wife's Younger Brother Residing, Chatting About Family Matters

His wife, Xi Zhen, is in her thirties (from Changshu). Her younger brother, Xi Delin, 19 years old, is a senior high school student at Beicai Vocational School at No. 71, Lane 519, Hedu Road. He lives with his sister. Her older brother, Xi Yuliang (35 years old), teaches at Jinyun Elementary School in Jinyun County, eastern Zhejiang. He came to Shanghai for a short stay during the summer vacation to catch up with his siblings. He originally planned to return home within days, but the coastal areas of Zhejiang and Fujian were blockaded by the Japanese, so the trip did not materialize. At around 10:00 PM the night before last, the Xi brothers were chatting side by side on the sofa in the living room, forgetting to close the outer waist door.

Thugs Open Fire, Wounding Xi Yuliang

At this moment, three thugs suddenly appeared. Two of them stood at the door by the roadside as lookouts. One of them, dressed in a blue cloth shirt and pants, with a gray silk long gown draped over his shoulders, pushed open the door and rushed into the living room. Without asking any questions, he drew a pistol and fired one shot, hitting Xi Yuliang in the left cheek and piercing his right ear. He fell onto the sofa with a thud, covered in blood. Seeing that their purpose was achieved, the thugs turned and fled, disappearing without a trace. His brother, Delin, escaped unharmed and cried out for help.

Cai Jumps Out, Legs Lacerated

At this time, Cai Guohua was wiping himself in the attic upstairs. Hearing the sound of gunfire, footsteps, and cries for help, fearing that the thugs might try to go upstairs and cause further harm, he quickly jumped out of the window, intending to climb over the wall. Unexpectedly, he slipped and fell onto the large glass skylight of No. 1 Fuxianfang Lane, causing severe lacerations to his buttocks and legs by the glass. He fled in pain to the kitchen of his neighbor at No. 45 to temporarily hide and avoid danger.

Both Injured, but Lives Not in Danger

After the incident, Xi Delin reported it to the French Concession Police Headquarters. A large number of detectives rushed to investigate everything. However, the three thugs had already fled far away. An ambulance was summoned to send both injured men to Room 108 of Guangci Hospital for treatment. According to the doctor, although Xi and Cai were seriously injured, their lives were not in danger. The motive behind this assassination attempt is shrouded in mystery, and it is not known what the target was. The police are investigating.

### New Hurricane Changes Direction

According to news from the Xujiahui Observatory yesterday afternoon, the new hurricane in the Pacific has changed direction. Shanghai and the coastal areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang can now avoid the impact. The hurricane's direction has changed from "west-northwest" to "north." Yesterday, it reached 20 degrees north latitude and 116 degrees east longitude, with a force of 9 and a circumference of 60 nautical miles. The above position is between Hong Kong and the Dongsha Islands.

### Attempt to Attack Zhenhai Failed Japanese Warships Return to Shanghai Eleven Ships Returned Over the Past Two Days

According to a telegram received by the shipping industry, Japanese warships outside Zhenhai continued to harass the fortress with artillery fire the day before yesterday, with shells landing in the mud and causing no damage. The number of Japanese warships outside Zhenhai has now decreased, and order in Ningbo and Zhenhai has returned to normal. The war situation has now eased. Although Japanese warships occasionally bombard fortresses and other places, the fighting has stopped. During the tense situation in the eastern Zhejiang war, almost all of the Japanese warships stationed in Shanghai left. Over the past two days, Japanese warships have been returning to the Huangpu River from Hangzhou Bay in succession. According to investigations, those arriving in Shanghai from there include Asakaze, the first-class destroyer Muhao, Renzidihao, Lianhao, and second-class destroyers, one of each; armed transport ships Hakone Maru, Hiramaru Maru, Tokumaru Maru, Nihonkai Maru, No. 7 Take Maru, No. 10 Unkai Maru, and the Red Cross ship Mikasayama Maru, totaling eleven ships.

### Japanese Again Visit Route Massenet Postal Branch Copying Names and Addresses of Post Office Box Holders Negotiations Still Needed After Jappé Returns to Shanghai

The Japanese side is now trying to extend the inspection work at the Shanghai Postal Administration to the French Concession. According to a visit by a Heiminsha News Agency reporter, the Route Massenet Postal Branch will be forced to implement mail inspection from the first of next month. On the day before yesterday (27th), four Japanese visited twice in the morning and afternoon, copying the names and addresses of post office box renters at the branch. The details are as follows:

Rumored to Implement Inspection from Next Month

From 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, four plainclothes Japanese visited the Route Massenet Postal Branch twice, going directly into the office. These people did not have anyone from the Postal Administration accompany them. They demanded that the room planned to be set up for "mail inspectors" be completed as soon as possible. It is rumored that mail inspection will be implemented from the first of next month, with the Japanese side setting up seven "mail inspectors" at the branch, their hours being from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM. However, officials at the Postal Administration say that the inspection matter is still under negotiation, and whether it can be avoided depends on the negotiations with Postal Director Jappé, who is scheduled to return to Shanghai today.

All Offices Seen One by One

The four Japanese also entered the offices of the branch, inspecting the upstairs letter room, express mail room, registered mail room, and outgoing mail room. The four Japanese did not understand Chinese, so the branch could not answer the four Japanese's questions. However, they could read Chinese, so they used written notes to answer.

Names of Post Office Box Holders Copied

Yesterday, the Japanese at the Route Massenet branch again copied the names and addresses of the post office box renters at the branch. There are a total of 250 post office boxes rented by Chinese and foreign residents at the branch. In addition to those rented by foreigners or concession institutions, many are rented by Chinese from all walks of life.

Sketching Branch's Postal Route Map

The branch's scope is wider than other branches. The Japanese also sketched a copy of the delivery route map within the branch's area. The branch's postal route map extends east to the Eight Immortals Bridge, west to Haig Road, north to the border of the Public Concession, and south to Xujiahui Road. The delivery routes of all postal branches in the French Concession, except for the Rue du Consulat branch, are included in this map, such as those of the three branches on Rue Cardinal Mercier, Route Conty, and Xujiahui.

Telegraphs Accepted on Behalf Will Also Be Inspected

It is also learned that telegrams accepted and sent on behalf of customers by the branch will also be inspected at the same time as mail inspection is implemented. According to those familiar with postal branches, the telegrams accepted by Shanghai postal branches are now sent by the telegraphic communications organs under Japanese inspection. Only the American Commercial News Agency on the Bund sends telegrams to Chinese domestic areas, which is said to be extremely fast and reliable.

Dutch Consul General Mr. Van der Berg, who previously stayed in Chongqing on official business, has recently officially returned to Shanghai and is handling official duties at the Dutch Consulate at No. 9 Avenue Dubail.

### Shanghai Rice and Coal Gradually Becoming Sufficient, Life Slightly More Stable. Foreign Rice Imports Cannot be Hidden by Importers. Fair Pricing Brings Rice Gradually Back on Track. Coal Industry Orders 100,000 Tons of Foreign Coal to Arrive in Shanghai by Early Winter

According to foreign newspapers, several rice importers in the city have been trying to keep the arrival of new rice shipments secret, but have failed. As a result, despite their efforts to raise rice prices, prices continue to fall. The Shun King Company's Mosna vessel arrived yesterday (the 27th) from Bangkok with 18,000 bags of Siamese rice, further increasing Shanghai's rice supply. According to Mr. He, the Deputy Director of the Public Works Department, current rice prices are relatively low, and residents should take the opportunity to purchase. In addition, rice is being shipped from Hong Kong, Saigon, and Siam, with an estimated 250,000 more bags of foreign rice expected to arrive in Shanghai within three weeks.

Supplementation

It is reported that the 100,000 bags of foreign rice ordered by local merchants at the suggestion of the authorities of the two concessions, part of which has already arrived at the port, and the remainder will arrive in Shanghai by August 15th. It is said that the purchasers of this batch of foreign rice are not those who wantonly raise prices. Mr. He also stated that as Shanghai rice prices have already fallen, the 10,000 bags of foreign rice ordered will be stored for future needs in case of a rice shortage. The fair-price rice sales that began on July 16th will only continue for eight days, with the price of broken rice set at 40 yuan per picul (80 kilograms). When the fair-price sales began, rice prices were much higher than today, so many people benefited from the fair prices. It is found that each of the 18 fair-price rice shops in the Public Concession was able to sell 50 bags initially, but last week, as rice prices fell sharply, the market price of foreign dregs rice was only one or two yuan different from the fair price, so the number of buyers of fair rice has decreased. However, all 15,000 bags of fair-price broken rice are expected to be sold out by the end, and it is estimated that about 750,000 people will have purchased fair-price rice by then.

Falling Rice Prices

Since the Shanghai Rice Evaluation Committee was officially established, it immediately began to assess the highest prices for buying and selling foreign rice, namely 63.5 yuan for Saigon Siam No. 1, 63 yuan for Fire Pattern, 61.5 yuan for Saigon Siam No. 2, 61 yuan for Small Twisted, 59.5 yuan for High Tokyo Blood Rice, 56 yuan for Tokyo Brown Rice, 53.5 yuan for Rice Green, and 49 yuan for Mixed Broken (the above prices are the prices assessed at the first meeting on the 9th of this month). However, as foreign rice has poured into the port, No. 2 Saigon Siam has fallen to 46 yuan, a decrease of 15.5 yuan compared to the first evaluation. The price of domestic Du Geng goods has also fallen by 13 or 14 yuan successively. The numbers for the fall in price of various grades of foreign rice are recorded as follows: (1) No. 1 Saigon Siam, down 11 yuan; (2) No. 2 Saigon Siam, down 15.5 yuan; (3) Fire Twisted, down 11 yuan; (4) Small Twisted, down 12.5 yuan; (5) High Tokyo Blood Rice, down 14.5 yuan; (6) Tokyo Brown Rice, down 14.5 yuan; (7) Rice Green, down 12.5 yuan. It is also learned that the Saigon-loaded Helspont vessel with 25,000 bags of tribute rice is expected to arrive at the port at 4:00 PM today, berthing at the Beijing Road Bund Wharf.

Telegraphing Orders for Foreign Coal

Although the stockpiles of coal depots in Pudong and Puxi are increasing daily, coal businesses, in order to prepare for the future and further increase their coal reserves, have jointly telegraphed coal-producing regions such as India and Annam, taking advantage of the stable exchange rate and low production prices, to order a total of 100,000 tons of smoky white coal lumps and dross, worth approximately one million national currency. This batch of coal has not yet been loaded onto ships and is expected to be loaded for shipment to Shanghai in mid-October. It is found that a total of 182,024 tons of coal were shipped from foreign countries in June of this year, valued at 1,900,821 gold, equivalent to 5,145,522 yuan in national currency, with British India accounting for the largest share, totaling 76,256 tons, followed by Annam with 47,286 tons, and Taiwan in third place with 21,948 tons. Imports in May totaled 182,832 tons, valued at 4,869,584 yuan in national currency.

### Export of the "Black Hawk" Warship

The U.S. Navy transport ship Black Hawk arrived in Shanghai from the Philippines this Monday (the 22nd) and docked at the British Navy buoy on the Yangjingbang Poomian. The transport ship weighed anchor at about 3:00 PM the day before yesterday and left the Wusong Port at 5:20 PM. Its destination is unknown; one account says it is heading to Qingdao.

A professor at a certain university in this city, namely Mr. Wang Weixi, a famous basketball player in Shanghai in the past, seeing that his hometown elders were in deep water and scorching fire after the Japanese army occupied his hometown, was eager for righteous indignation, so he abandoned his post to join the army, gathered young comrades, returned to his hometown to organize a guerrilla team, fought many times, and achieved great results. He also made bandits disappear and the local area peaceful. The people all praised this fortune.

Committing Evil

Heyu Bridge, thirty miles north of the city, is the only major town under the county. After its fall, all the local responsible persons have fled elsewhere. Cheng Youda operated a cattle business in the town. He usually committed evil deeds, and people generally regarded him as a "different person." When the national army moved west and the Japanese army occupied the town, Cheng came out to receive the Japanese army, winning the favor of the Japanese side. He was immediately appointed as the chairman of the so-called "Maintenance Association" of the town, and thus seized all the public funds of the town in the name of maintenance fees, becoming a wealthy man of the time.

Righteousness Over Family

His son, Weixin, was a handsome young man, always with vigor, but under the current environment, he greatly disliked his father's actions. He secretly gathered a small number of young people, hid on the shore of the nearby lake, gathered comrades, organized the masses, and opposed his father, showing a great sense of righteousness over family. Those who heard the news and came to serve reached several hundred. Weixin knew that his mission was getting bigger and his responsibility was getting heavier. Without talent, knowledge, and the ability to endure hardship, it would be difficult to plan everything perfectly. He then remembered Wang Weixi, who was teaching at a certain university in Shanghai, and rushed to Shanghai overnight to urge him to return to his hometown.

Abandoning the Pen for the Sword

Wang Weixi is from Heyu Bridge in Yixing. He had a close relationship with Cheng. When he was studying at a certain university in southern Shanghai, he was extremely fond of sports and was a famous basketball player in Shanghai. He had repeatedly served as a representative of the Chinese basketball team and attended international competitions. After graduating, he immediately took a teaching position at his original school. He was always loyal and patriotic, with great ambitions. He believed that in this great era, he should personally go to the front line and risk his life on the battlefield. He had long harbored this intention and finally achieved his goal. Last year, he met his friend Cheng Weixin. After a thorough discussion, he made several points, the main one being to ask Cheng's father, Cheng Youda, to immediately leave Heyu Bridge. Cheng immediately accepted completely and promised to handle everything with full authority. Thereupon, he resolutely resigned from all his posts, abandoned his pen for the sword, and set off to return to Yixing.

Outstanding War Records

After the response, in addition to reorganizing the original team, he recruited comrades such as Tan Dong and actively organized the masses. In the past few months, he attacked the Japanese army six times, with the battles of An Yu Bridge, Five Caves Bridge, and Zhang Jin Dam being the most successful. In addition to annihilating dozens of Japanese soldiers, he also captured seven people and obtained many guns and military uniforms. As for the elimination of traitors, bandits, and the eradication of bad elements, there were daily reports. Now, within a five-mile radius of the area, bandits have disappeared, the neighborhoods are peaceful, and merchants and people are enjoying their livelihoods. He Bodian, the owner of Yongtaixiang Cotton Cloth Shop, No. 63 Qingyuan Lane, Beijing Road, Guangdong, ordered 480 pieces of Qinghua Factory's frog-colored label cloth from Chen Yongsen, the owner of Zhikang Cotton Cloth Shop, No. 20 Bai'er Road, Nanyang Bridge, on April 10th of this year, at a price of 38.5 yuan per piece, packed in eight boxes. It was stipulated that Chen Yongsen would be responsible for obtaining a domestic goods certificate from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, one for each box, and send it with the goods so that they could be shipped and sold to the interior in batches. He Bodian immediately paid Chen the full price of 18,480 yuan. Unexpectedly, Chen gave He only one domestic goods certificate, and it was forged. The remaining seven certificates were delayed for two months and the contract was not fulfilled. At that time, the cloth had risen to 58 yuan per piece. Because He did not have the domestic goods certificate, he could not ship and sell the goods, and the cloth that had already been sold was also returned by the customers. He then asked lawyer He Niande to write to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to inquire, and Chen had not applied to the Chamber for a certificate. At this point, He realized that Chen was using inferior goods

to pose as domestic goods, and forging a certificate to carry out fraudulent means to make money. Therefore, He recently hired lawyers He Niande and Mao Xianshen to file a complaint with the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court, accusing Chen of three crimes, namely fraud, breach of trust, and forgery of documents. The case was recently heard by Judge Li in the Second Criminal Court. The plaintiff, He Bodian, also claimed damages and other expenses, totaling 27,840 yuan. The defendant, accompanied by defense lawyers Zhu Taiqing and Yu Hualong, pleaded to the court, stating that the defendant was also a victim. Originally, the domestic goods certificate was entrusted by the defendant to Wang Xianglin, who specializes in handling

certificate documents

, to handle. As soon as the defendant received the notice from the plaintiff that it was forged, he immediately reported it to the Central Patrol Room for investigation. Wang had already taken refuge in the Hongkou area, and there was a check stub that showed the defendant's payment of the handling fee to Wang Xianglin as evidence. This matter clearly proves that it has nothing to do with the defendant and the court should make a clear judgment. Judge Li verified the words and ordered a change of date to summon Wang Xianglin to the court for investigation and questioning.

### The Japanese Search Jianye Lane and Mao Hui is Arrested

Mao Hui, a native of Jiangshan County, Zhejiang Province, is 64 years old. He has been practicing medicine for a living, running a clinic at No. 11 West Street, Jianye Lane, French Concession, for more than ten years. Recently, Mao and three or four friends jointly established Daxin Trading Company, specializing in stationery, which they transport to the interior. Mao serves as an important officer in the company. In recent years, he has

suffered from illness

and finds it difficult to move around, and has very little contact with the outside world. However, the Japanese suddenly pointed out that Mao Hui was related to the Chinese guerrillas in the suburbs of Shanghai, so they sent a large number of personnel to request assistance from the French Patrol Room to search Mao's residence. The French Patrol Room immediately dispatched detectives to

join the Japanese personnel

, traveling in two private cars and a large truck, with a total of about thirty to sixty people. They arrived at Mao's residence at about 6:00 AM yesterday morning. At that time, Mao Hui and his family were all fast asleep when a large number of detectives suddenly poured in, which was very surprising. Japanese personnel and French Patrol Room detectives then

began to search

Mao's residence, relatives' and friends' deposited clothing trunks, drawers, and other places were carefully searched for about an hour. As a result, nothing was found, nor were any documents related to the guerrillas discovered. However, the Japanese insisted on

taking Mao Hui

himself to the French Patrol Room. After the French Patrol Room questioned him briefly, detectives escorted him back to Jianye Lane to retrieve a book of accounts from Daxin Trading Company and a book of Mao's daily notes. He was still taken back to the detention center by the detectives. As of 1:00 AM this morning, he had not been released.

### Tong Shiheng Found After Being Kidnapped

Tong Shiheng, the manager of Zhufeng Enameled Porcelain Factory, was kidnapped in front of the factory on Binlang Road in Shanghai West at about 10:00 AM the day before yesterday, as detailed in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that Tong's car (No. 6369) was found by patrolling Chinese constables at the intersection of Yidingpan Road and Pingyuan Road in Shanghai West until 12:00 AM the night before yesterday. The patrol room sent someone to drive the car to the patrol room. It was not until 9:00 AM yesterday morning that the factory was notified to send a driver to retrieve it. However, there is still no news of Tong himself, and his family has not received a ransom letter. The patrol room is conducting a strict search.

### Social Miscellany

Based on reports from informants, Chinese detectives from the Lao Zha Patrol Room said that drug dealers nicknamed the "Black, White, and Red Three Kings," Xiancai Amao, Wang Hongfa, Xu Fuyuan, etc., had secretly set up drug organizations at No. 65 and No. 67 Beihai Road. They immediately led Chinese and Western police officers to the addresses and arrested five accomplices, Wang Shengcai, Wang Huangshi, etc., seizing about eight ounces of heroin and dozens of ounces of opium. Yesterday, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the First Special Court for prosecution according to law. After questioning by Judge Feng, the defendants were remanded in custody to await the arrest of the main culprits for further investigation.

Zhu Hongjin, a handyman from Shenhe Truck Shop at No. 165 Alabastor Road, Yixing, was washing his feet at the water tap in front of the truck shop at 6:00 PM on the 7th of this month. Mao Hongsheng, a native of Changzhou, who was carrying flowers for life, passed by. Because the flowers in the basket were withering, he also took water from the tap to water the flowers and accidentally sprinkled Zhu's shoes. Zhu immediately questioned Mao, and the two had an argument. Zhu actually incited his fellow handyman, Shao Arong, a local, to beat Mao to death together. Afterwards, the patrol arrived and detained Zhu and Shao and sent them to the First Special Court, charging them with injuring someone leading to death. Judge Jiang concluded the trial a few days ago and scheduled the verdict for August 4th.

### Patriotic Feelings of British Residents. Enthusiastic Registration for Military Service. The Number is Surprisingly High. Registration Temporarily Suspended for Physical Examinations.

According to the Dalu News, the British Consulate in Shanghai set up a recruitment office for the army, navy, and air force two weeks ago. British residents in China enthusiastically registered, and the number was surprisingly high. Therefore, from now on, registration for those who voluntarily enlist in the army and air force will be temporarily suspended for one week until August 5th to facilitate physical examinations for those who have already registered and to allow the overworked staff to get some rest. However, British residents with experience in nautical-related technologies can still apply to enlist in the British Navy.

### Song Queen Ai Mei Accuses Tobacco Factory Owner of Abandonment. They Lived Together Briefly and Then Separated. Defendant Claims Ms. Wang Fled.

Ai Mei, a song queen from Beiying Shuyu, No. 1, Lane 1, Xinhui Le Lane, Yunnan Road, recently filed a complaint with the Criminal Court of the First Special Court, accusing Chen Yufa (residing at Hongyun Villa No. 28, Jing'an Temple Road, and the factory director of Yuhua Tobacco Company) of bigamy, abandonment, and encroachment. The complaint stated that she was an uneducated woman with a shallow mind. In August of the lunar calendar last year, she met the defendant in

Beiying Shuyu

. Seeing that she was slightly attractive, the defendant claimed that he was not yet married and asked to marry her. She was lured by his sweet words and believed it to be true, so on November 2nd, she and the defendant signed a marriage certificate at Lao Ban Zhai Restaurant on Hankou Road with the witness Hou Lanpo and others. Afterwards, the defendant ordered her to

leave her family

and move all her belongings to the upstairs of Gu Yuanfa Furniture Store, Laohui Le Lane, Sanma Road to live together, and then moved to No. 479 Weihaiwei Road. At that time, the defendant suddenly said to her, "My wife has now passed away, so you can rest assured." Only then did she know that the defendant was married. However, since what's done is done, she could only blame herself for her bad luck. Not long after living together, the defendant said that the cigarette factory

business was booming and that it could make five or six times the profit. Therefore, he invested the 500 yuan she had deposited in Wing On Company, a gold bracelet, a watch, two small diamond rings, and a leather coat in the cigarette factory. On April 30th of this year, the defendant asked her to open a room at the New Shanghai Hotel and forced her to hand over the marriage certificate. Hearing this, she felt so sad that she tried to commit suicide by swallowing

opium. The defendant discovered this and asked a doctor to save her. The defendant's actions violated the criminal law, and she asked the court to punish him accordingly. The court accepted the complaint, and Judge Xiao held a trial in the First Criminal Court yesterday morning. The defendant hired lawyer Yin Tinghua to defend him. He claimed that in October of last year, he socialized with clients and frequented the flower world, getting to know the plaintiff. He acknowledged that they had lived together for a while, but the plaintiff had long been living a life of a goddess,

unaccustomed to domestic life

. Therefore, on February 24th of this year, while the defendant was out, she suddenly took away the radio, clothes, jewelry, and a gold ring with the words "Yu Fa" on it, and hid without a trace. He had entrusted lawyer Yin to publish a statement in the newspaper, severing the cohabitation relationship with the plaintiff. Therefore, there was no crime to speak of. The court verified the words and instructed both parties to go out and try to reconcile, rescheduling the hearing for the 2nd of next month.

### Tian Xu Wo Sheng's Posthumous Works, Published in Difficult Times by Zhubao

The writer Tian Xu Wo Sheng passed away in April of this year. During the 27 years, the teacher traveled into the interior, passing through places such as Hanyuyu Rongdian.

### Letter

Sir, I have just read in the social column of your newspaper that Si Gedebo, a policeman from the Tesla Road, Hague Lee Police Station, had a conflict with Tao Awu, a Jiangbei rickshaw puller, and beat Tao Awu to death. It is clear that the report is inaccurate. It is found that the rickshaw puller Tao Awu had a conflict with a passenger whose name is unknown, resulting in the passenger falling on the car. Later, the on-duty policeman arrived and took the assailant, Tao Awu, and the injured passenger to the police station together. Moreover, it has nothing to do with me. It is a matter of human life and concerns my reputation. Therefore, I am writing to your newspaper to ask you to correct it as soon as possible in order to clarify the facts. Sincerely, Si Gedebo, No. 151 Hague Lee, Tesla Road, Zhang Yuxi. July 27th.

### Guixiang Approved by the Ministry to Establish Two Temporary Secondary Schools, Established in Yangli and Rong County, with Insufficient Funds to be Subsidized by the Ministry of Education

(Guilin Airlines News) Since the outbreak of the war in southern Guangxi, the number of young people in the war zone who have been affected by the war and have become wanderers and dropouts has been considerable. Moreover, students and soldiers from the war zone have returned to the province to enroll in schools one after another. The capacity of public and private secondary schools in this province to accommodate students from the war zone by borrowing or transferring schools has reached its maximum, and it is difficult to continue to accommodate them. The local authorities have telegraphed the Ministry of Education to establish national secondary schools in this province. The Ministry of Education replied that there were many difficulties in establishing national secondary schools and instructed to set up provincial temporary secondary schools. If the funds are insufficient, the provincial government will subsidize them. The provincial government plans to open a provincial temporary secondary school in Yangli and Rong County each starting in the fall of this year in order to accommodate students withdrawing from the war zones of Nanning, Wuwu, Longzhou, etc. It is planned to temporarily recruit six classes per school, with an estimated opening cost of about 40,000 yuan per school and a regular annual cost of 38,000 yuan. It is reported that the opening costs and the costs for the first semester of the 29th academic year have been requested from the Ministry of Education for full subsidy. From the second semester of the 29th academic year, the required regular expenses will be subsidized by the Ministry of Education by 70%.

### School News

It is heard that the school is scheduled to open on August 24th.

Siyuan Middle School has been specially approved for registration by the Ministry of Education of this city. Siyuan Middle School, originally located west of Avenue Edward VII, Datong Road, has received an exceptionally enthusiastic response from applicants since it began enrolling students this year. To ensure effective teaching and management, the school is exclusively accepting male students, thereby imposing a restriction. Consequently, female applicants were initially rejected. Subsequently, in response to requests from parents of female students from all walks of life, a second branch was established at No. 1233, Gordon Road, Rue Robert, to accommodate female students. Since the start of enrollment, many of the female students who were previously rejected by the school have flocked to apply. It is now known that the school is scheduled to hold entrance examinations for new and transfer students at all levels of junior and senior high school on August 2nd. Candidates for both branches will take the examinations simultaneously at the first branch. According to the person in charge of the school, the school building of the first branch can originally only accommodate more than 500 people. Aside from those admitted last time, there are not many remaining places, and the number of applicants this time is almost double the remaining places. Therefore, it is planned to stop and no longer continue to recruit students after this enrollment.

Xia Guang Middle School, located at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Datong Road, has been operating for many years. For the main subjects in the British system, classes are held for more than seven hours per week.

### The Contents of Inheritance and Methods of Tax Evasion—Strategies and Countermeasures

— Ai Cheng

Foreword

Direct taxes are not only difficult to shift, but also have stable revenue. Moreover, their tax rates can be progressive, making them very fair. European and American countries have successively adopted them, and their share of fiscal revenue has gradually increased. However, China's fiscal revenue has always been mainly based on customs, unified, and consumption taxes. Since 1936, it has followed other countries by first levying income tax, and then, in view of the development of various industries, it has also levied excessive profit tax. This year, it has also levied inheritance tax. According to general opinion, a large inheritance obtained by an heir is similar to a windfall. It does not require the heir's own labor. However, the state often protects its safety and can therefore tax it to make up for fiscal deficits. At the same time, the burden of inheritance tax, in theory, does not fall on the heir, but on the deceased himself. However, the deceased does not feel the pain of bearing the tax in advance. The tax base is also very stable and not easily affected by the environment. Therefore, inheritance tax can be said to be the fairest of direct taxes.

Contents of Inheritance

According to the provisions of China's Inheritance Tax Regulations, the principle of territoriality is the rule, and the principle of nationality is the exception. That is, regardless of who has inheritance in China, it should be taxed. Similarly, Chinese citizens who have property abroad but have property in China should also be taxed. Now, let's first explain the contents of inheritance. Inheritance is the property left by the deceased. Its contents can be divided into broad and narrow definitions. Broadly defined inheritance includes not only positive assets but also negative assets. Negative assets are debts. Usual inheritance is the inheritance of broadly defined inheritance. Narrowly defined inheritance is the portion remaining after deducting negative assets from positive assets. The object of inheritance tax, in theory, should be limited to narrowly defined inheritance. The Inheritance Tax Regulations also make such provisions and the scope of deductions is quite broad. (1) Taxes and fines payable according to law (criminal fines (administrative fines)). (2) Debts not repaid by the deceased before death. (3) Necessary expenses for managing current inheritance and executing wills. (4) Agricultural implements or work tools for engaging in other industries, with a value not exceeding 500 yuan. (5) Timber that has not reached the felling age according to law. In addition, there are provisions that certain types of inheritance are exempt from inheritance tax due to their special circumstances. (1) The total value of the inheritance is less than 5,000 yuan. (2) Inheritance of officers, soldiers, and civil servants of the army and navy who die in action or are injured in war. (3) Books and articles related to culture, history, and art in the inheritance, which the heir declares to preserve and registers with the inheritance tax collection agency, but the heir must pay taxes if he transfers these books and articles. (4) Property donated to governments at all levels. (5) Property donated to educational, cultural, or charitable public welfare undertakings, not exceeding 500,000 yuan. (6) Copyrights of the deceased and patents on academic inventions, or artistic works created by himself.

Possibilities of Tax Evasion

However, there is a problem that is difficult to solve in the contents of the inheritance. That is, should the compensation obtained after the death of the deceased who has life insurance with an insurance company be included in the inheritance for calculation? Although China's Insurance Law has been promulgated, it has not yet been implemented. According to usual circumstances and general legal principles, this kind of compensation obtained after death cannot be regarded as the property of the deceased, because obtaining this property requires the death of the insured as the time limit. Therefore, this compensation must be obtained by the beneficiary after the death of the deceased. Logically, it cannot be regarded as inheritance. Therefore, even if the deceased goes bankrupt after death, the life insurance compensation will not be included in the bankrupt estate for calculation, and the family can enjoy all the benefits. If the same interpretation is made in the Inheritance Tax Regulations, then the compensation should not be taxed. However, this regulation does not have detailed and explicit provisions. If such an interpretation is made, it seems to be inconsistent with the principle of levying inheritance tax. Because if the compensation does not need to be taxed, the deceased can use his property for life insurance in advance, expand the amount of insurance, and enter into a death insurance contract with the insurer for life without survival conditions. After death, the heir can obtain all tax-free property. Now, in order to avoid this kind of malpractice and to accommodate the facts, it is better to include it in the inheritance for calculation. There are many ways to evade inheritance tax, which are briefly described below:

(1) Division during life. The division of inheritance by the deceased during his lifetime does not necessarily contain malicious intent. For example, the deceased often divides the inheritance during his lifetime to avoid the trouble of dividing the inheritance among his children after death. However, malicious division is inevitable. For example, before death, the inheritance is first divided and registered under the names of the children. The most common are farmland and houses in the countryside. Movable property is even easier to divide and does not require legal procedures. It can achieve the expected purpose simply by separate possession. This kind of division is more popular in China than in Europe and America because China and Europe and America have different customs. Europe and America still value individualism, and fathers and sons are independent of each other. Usually, they can only inherit their father's property after their father's death. In China, the family system is prevalent, and property is often distributed in advance due to separation, marriage, and business operations. Therefore, this regulation stipulates that if property is divided within three years before the death of the deceased, the property that has been divided should still be regarded as part of the inheritance and taxed together, which is not unreasonable.

(2) Gifts during life or forging debts. Gifts during life means making false or real gifts of all property to third parties as much as possible, so that the total value of the inheritance is reduced to the minimum. However, this kind of gift can usually be resisted based on the legal principle that the exercise of rights shall not harm the rights of others, unless it is explicitly stipulated by law as invalid. This regulation explicitly stipulates that property given as gifts within three years before death should still be regarded as inheritance. Forging debts means increasing negative assets, indirectly reducing inheritance relatively, and reducing the amount of tax payable. These two methods are often used by heirs in limited inheritance. Now, before inheritance tax is levied, there must be inheritance facts. If the inheritor engages in this kind of behavior in the inheritance facts, he can also benefit from inheritance taxation, killing two birds with one stone.

(3) Concealing property or making false records on the inheritance book. Concealing property means hiding the property that has been obtained so that others do not know about it. The concealed property is usually movable property, mostly of high value and small volume. For example, diamond rings or cash are most easily concealed by the deceased. Making false records on the inheritance book means lowering the value of the property as much as possible, so that the valuation committee will inevitably be subjected to its prior hints in the future and be deceived. This is also a common occurrence in limited inheritance.

(4) Transferring property abroad. This can be said to be a kind of evasion behavior. For example, if overseas Chinese engage in trade with a certain country, they often establish current accounts with local banks or store deposits as collateral. However, they do not have an address in the country. When death is imminent, in order to avoid taxation, they withdraw the deposit and remit it abroad, making it difficult for the government to deal with. If they have an address in China, then it should be treated differently.

(5) Although not dividing the property during life, registering the property under different names. This method is often used for bank deposits. For example, the account name for a deposit in a certain bank is set as Fuli, and the account name for a deposit in another bank is set as Luli. Although there are many account names, there is only one person. Therefore, the total amount of inheritance after death is difficult to investigate and determine. The characteristics of progressive taxation are also difficult to express. For example, although the income tax rate that has already been levied is also a progressive system, it is still levied separately because the total amount of income is not easy to determine. The inequality is obvious.

Proposed Measures to Prevent Tax Evasion

The methods to prevent tax evasion can be divided into active and passive. The active aspect is to vigorously instill knowledge to the people and encourage patriotic enthusiasm. To make ordinary people know the true meaning of inheritance tax, which is by no means a government extortion. And explain how the government will benefit after the inheritance tax is levied. All of these can make people happy to do it and pay automatically. Therefore, it can not only increase the amount of tax, but also reduce the expenses incurred in taxation. As for passive prevention, such as establishing penalties. Those who maliciously try to reduce the amount of tax and hide property should be punished. However, the severity of the penalty does not have to be too severe, only strict investigation is required. Make sure that lawbreakers cannot escape the law. And encourage the reporting of concealed inheritance. Secondly, if there are detailed records of each person's property, the local competent authorities should conduct frequent investigations so that the property situation in the local area is well understood, and it will be difficult to conceal it. At the same time, there must be careful investigation of the household registration, so it is not easy to create account names arbitrarily. However, passive prevention is ultimately not as thorough and economical as active prevention. Because passive prevention is very costly, and there are many tricks to tax evasion. For example, in Shanghai, foreign financial power is quite large, so people who want to hide property can deposit it in foreign banks in advance. As for the reason why the income tax rate levied on bank interest is only 5% of the total interest, the reason is also here. Because after adopting the progressive tax rate, the wealthy will never want to deposit all their property in Chinese banks. Therefore, not only will tax revenue be insecure, but China's financial strength will also be damaged.

Now, inheritance tax is still in the trial stage in our country, and we cannot immediately expect it to achieve satisfactory results. However, the biggest shortcoming is that the levying of inheritance tax pays too much attention to the object of taxation. The same is true for income tax. For example, if the deceased A has a family property of 4 million yuan, after deducting 20% tax, 3.6 million yuan remains. He leaves behind a wife and three young children, and the burden in the future will be heavy. However, B also has 4 million yuan of family property. After deducting the tax, he also only has 3.6 million yuan left. He only leaves behind a wife and one child, and the burden is very light. Compared with the two, although the tax rates are the same, it seems that the tax levied on the former is heavier than the latter in fact. Unless the tax rate of the former is reduced, or the tax rate of the latter is increased, it can be considered fair. Therefore, in addition to using the size of the amount of the taxable object as the standard for increasing the tax rate, the environment of the heir must also be considered to make it fair in fact. However, we deeply believe that the levying of inheritance will definitely bring some benefit to the country's finances.

### On "Golden Toilet" Theory and "Golden Table" Theory

— Zhang Shizhi

During the final years of the last European War, when Lenin led the Soviet people in implementing the socialist revolution, he declared: "Gather all the world's gold and use it in place of bricks and tiles to build the walls of several public toilets." Although this proposition was not implemented, gold was indeed no longer valued by the general public in the Soviet Union. While the Soviet government worked hard to increase gold production, it did so solely to meet the needs of general capitalist countries. What they welcomed were goods, useful goods.

Now, the European War has just entered its second phase, but Germany is already discussing the postwar world economy and the world. Dr. Wenxichu, the chief writer of the Berlin General News, recently published a paper (see this newspaper on the 23rd of this month). He believes that the use of gold after the war is extremely narrow: "No one wants to carry such heavy things anymore; people all over the world prefer to use bank notes and checks; they no longer want to use gold for payment." America, which is full of gold, may only be able to "melt the gold and make it into gold utensils for the tables of American ministers and ambassadors."

Similarly, German Minister of Economic Affairs Funk also said: The postwar international economic organization will "develop towards a clearing system," and "Europe's future currency can no longer be based on gold." Therefore, he said: "We dare not predict what the future of American gold will be."

Originally, gold cannot be directly used to satisfy hunger, nor can it be directly used to cover the body: it can be said that it makes no contribution to human material life. It is only because it is used as a medium of exchange that it has created its current "almighty state." Moreover, because its production areas are unevenly distributed, and because its accumulation forms are unevenly distributed, there is a "gold plethora" in some places and "gold anemia" in others, causing all kinds of unrest in the general social economy and even the entire world economy. Therefore, in the monetary trends after the First European War, there was already the theory of a fixed value of coins. Since the outbreak of the world panic in 1929, the successive abandonment of the gold standard by various countries has actually been the initial practice of this monetary theory. However, the Soviet Union and Germany's contempt for gold is more likely to be based on political action rather than monetary theory.

People to people, country to country, never forget their unique weapons. They use their special weapons to enhance their own status and increase their power to control the other party. As a result, inequality between rich and poor is formed in society, and inequality between strong and weak is formed in the international community. Lenin was leading the proletarian revolution, of course, he first had to disarm the bourgeoisie. The bourgeoisie relies on their unique gold to create their own special rights, so he came up with a "golden toilet theory."

After Germany conquered France, although the future of the Anglo-German war is still unpredictable, its position in Europe has undoubtedly become astonishing.

Germany's greatest economic weakness is its lack of gold. If Europe's economy is to be transformed according to its ideals, the first thing to do is to overturn the position of gold in the modern economic system. Disarming other countries means strengthening one's own power. This goes without saying!

What is even more noteworthy is that the German side issued this theory at a time when the United States was deeply troubled by the excessive expansion of gold; especially on the day when Roosevelt accepted his third nomination as a presidential candidate. President Roosevelt has a strong sense of justice, and Americans are also inherently inclined to ally with Britain. The German side, of course, is always clear about this. The concentrated gold and silver policy is a part of President Roosevelt's New Deal movement. He attempts to establish a foundation for controlling international finance by this means, and then, according to his ideals, redistribute the world's gold and silver and establish a new international finance. This point is understood by Germany, which is short of gold. Therefore, when President Roosevelt accepted his third nomination as a Democratic presidential candidate, the German side successively published the "golden table" theory, and there is a connection between them; it can also be imagined. To put it more clearly: this "golden table" theory can increase the American people's distress over gold plethora, can help a part of the American opposition to the New Deal movement gain momentum; in the American presidential election, it may therefore have some effects that conform to German interests; perhaps this is another reason why the Germans are particularly happy to discuss this today? If Germany also had a large amount of gold, then it might not be willing to do so anymore! It is precisely because Germany is a gold-poor country, and at the same time, it has indeed established its position in Europe; in addition, the world's gold is indeed accumulated too much in the United States, and the United States, both the government and the public, really feel the pain of not being able to disperse this excessively expanded gold. In addition to this drastic change in the international political situation and the drastic change in the distribution of world gold, as well as the monetary trend that has long surpassed the constraints of gold, the change in the status of gold after the war is probably an inevitable trend?

### A Review of the Foreign Exchange Market This Week

According to the report of the Shanghai Economic Consulting Institute, the foreign exchange market last week not only did not break away from the hovering, but also the ups and downs became more and more stable. The volume of transactions was small, and most of them were swaps. The highest US dollar exchange rate was 6.125 yuan, and the lowest was 6.0625 yuan. The highest British pound exchange rate was 3 shillings, 8 pence, 90625, and the lowest was 3 shillings, 8 pence, 4375. The stability is due to half of the international situation and the brewing of domestic military affairs, and half of the looming peace atmosphere. In addition, the recent sharp decline in foreign trade, the time of the slack season, the situation is inherently appropriate. International routes have repeatedly encountered obstacles, and the impact is not shallow. Since trade has been frustrated, the supply and demand of foreign exchange has naturally decreased. Although it is said that the fluctuations in the foreign exchange market are due to speculators making trouble, the trend of the foreign exchange market depends on the promotion of commerce. Those who wait for the opportunity to move are just fueling the flames, and they are not enough to influence the original trend. Moreover, in the turmoil of May, operators have generally suffered great pain, and their vitality has not recovered. Even if they have surplus funds, they will be hesitant to move forward.

Since the deterioration of the European situation, I don't know how many people from Southeast Asia have returned to Shanghai with funds. In addition, the British government has tightened currency management, and currencies directly or indirectly linked to the pound cannot help but feel uneasy. In addition, the exchange rate between the US and Britain is also restricted, so more and more people come to Shanghai to sell foreign exchange and exchange it for legal tender. Recently, the deposits of various banks in this city have increased sharply, and it is said that most of them come from other places, which is clear evidence.

Even for those who hold foreign exchange drafts in this city, because the use of foreign exchange drafts is becoming narrower and narrower, and dangers abound, they also think of home when they are away from home, and sell them in time, still relying on legal tender. Pessimists believe that the market is full of speculative funds, and the group buying of foreign exchange one day is actually a hidden worry in the foreign exchange market. However, they do not know that the reason why the speculative funds are full is precisely because there is doubt about foreign currency. To return to the original state, there is still the phenomenon of squeezing, that is, the squeezing trend of gold and foreign exchange is becoming more and more severe. Recalling May of this year, when the foreign exchange rate tightened, the gold price was squeezed to a huge amount of 700 yuan to 1,000 yuan. Now it is only squeezed by 300 to 400 yuan. According to the smaller the degree of gold squeezing, it can be proved that the US dollar needs are lacking. Because speculators buy gold, they must have strength. Although mortgages can be made, they are limited by laws and regulations, and the number is limited. Foreign exchange drafts only need to pay a deposit, and there are one or two months of futures that can be made. Therefore, although gold and foreign exchange have the same trend, in terms of supply and demand, the need for foreign exchange drafts is more extensive, and the actual use should be prioritized by foreign exchange drafts. The close convergence of the trends of the two shows that all parties are not very interested in foreign exchange. Looking at the reduction of discounted exchange rates and the convergence of current and futures exchange rates, the trend of the market can be seen.

### Financial Commentary

— Sheng Kaiqiong

Continued from yesterday—July 27—

However, after the implementation of this law, the source of free pounds cannot be completely cut off. Its sources include (1) dividends and interest due to foreign funds inside and outside the sterling area; (2) insurance compensation obtained by foreigners in British insurance companies; (3) the transfer of foreign pound deposits to central people or another foreign pound deposit; (4) pound payments for goods imported into the UK under pre-war contracts. Free pounds generated from these four aspects are still traded according to the market price in New York, so if the British government wants to completely ban free pounds, it must have the help of the United States.

On July 18, the UK implemented new regulations for managing the pound. The details of these regulations are still unknown. According to Reuters' London telegram on the 19th, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, like the Bank of England, sells pounds at 4.025 and buys pounds at 4.035, and establishes a "Registered Accounts". In addition to the United States, the British government also has special agreements with Switzerland (Switzerland is also a place where free pounds are active), Canada, Newfoundland, the Dutch East Indies, Belgium, Congo, Syria, Sweden, Argentina, Brazil, and Romania. But regardless of its details, just looking at the point that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York buys and sells pounds at 4.025-4.035, it is naturally a threat to free pounds, so the British side firmly believes that although the free pound market is still open every day in New York, it will disappear in the near future.

### The Predicament of Japanese Trade

After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Japan's foreign trade deteriorated greatly due to the sharp increase in the import of military raw materials. In order to improve the situation, it strengthened exchange controls and implemented the Temporary Measures Law for Import and Export Goods to prevent the import of non-essential goods, and even imposed restrictions on the raw materials of the fiber industry, such as wool and cotton, which constitute the basis of Japan's export trade. After that, it implemented various trade policies to suppress imports and promote exports. However, the trade situation always looks good on the surface, but in essence it is extremely bad. (To be continued)

### No Progress in Foreign Stocks This Week

The situation of foreign stocks was once excited on Monday (15th) last week, and has been tired until this week. The average number of industrial stocks is 233.87, a drop of 5.36 compared with the previous week. The average number of rubber stocks is 249.46, a drop of 11.70 compared with the previous week. The transaction value of industrial stocks is 15,620,400 yuan, rubber stocks are 2,881,700 yuan, and bonds are 95,600 yuan, totaling 18,597,700 yuan, which is slightly more than half of the previous week. Because the situation is dull, speculation is waiting for development.

### Coal Briquettes Rebound Instead of Falling, Adding 16 Yuan Per Ton

The coal briquette market, due to differences of opinion among peers, changes in the morning and evening, and several markets a day, making people dizzy and at a loss. Yesterday, the inter-dealer dismantling fell to a low of 100 yuan. Today, after a compromise between the two sides, it rebounded instead of falling, adding 16 yuan per ton, 116 yuan for white cars, and 6 yuan and 4 corners for each 100 city gates in Mujie Menzhuang, adding 1 yuan per dan.

### The Sugar Market Is Stable

Yesterday, the Sugar Market Association allocated the market. The original warehouse price of 24 coarse white was 66.2 yuan and 66 yuan, and then returned to 65.8 yuan. The price of transit goods delivered on August 2 was 51 yuan and 50.08 yuan. Finally, it returned to a small corner. The current delivery price was 50.05 yuan. The original warehouse price of Taikoo B Mark was 73 yuan, and the West warehouse was 72.8 yuan. The original warehouse price of Dutch Red WA was 60.05 yuan, and the Dutch cotton white was 68.5 yuan.

### Re-copying Old Newspapers Sixty-seven Years Ago (459) (See This Newspaper in the Twelfth Year of Tongzhi in the Late Qing Dynasty)

Medicine King Bodhisattva

Whenever I see village women entering the city, they worship every temple they encounter, and every worship is accompanied by chanting scriptures. But in fact, when they enter the door, they don't even see what is written on the plaque. They generally say Bodhisattva, not knowing whether it is Buddha, Tao, or Confucian ancestor. But it is not only women, rumors are untrue, and customs are followed, even scholars follow suit. The Buddhist scriptures have Medicine King Bodhisattva, Medicine Superior Bodhisattva, and Medicine Master Buddha. I don't know if they are the same or different. But I heard that people in the world regard Medicine King as Shennong. Provincial capitals and prefectures often have temples. Doctors and medicine merchants raise money to pay their respects, or celebrate the birth of the god, or patrol to drive away epidemics, and collect money for temple fairs. The name is Medicine King, but the matter is Shennong. Is it one or two? I don't know either. Suppose Medicine King is Shennong, then is Medicine Superior Bodhisattva Qibo? It is also said that Medicine Master Buddha can eliminate disasters and prolong life. On people's birthdays, they decline relatives and friends to celebrate and invite monks to worship the Medicine Master Repentance. However, the Medicine Master Lamp thinks that Medicine Master specializes in prolonging life, and generally it is the same heart and situation as Medicine King's saving diseases. It should be a different name for Medicine King. The world worships Medicine King, but does not know where it is based on. However, the customs are like this, and it is impossible to recover. It is not surprising to worship him. As for mistakenly celebrating the birth of the god, it is even more absurd. If Medicine King is Shennong, the Road History Bamboo Book and the Historical Records of the Emperors, when describing before Tang and Yu, never mentioned his birth on which day. Today, the people of Tianjin roar and take April 16 as his birthday. According to what book does it say so?

### Past Graces of Summer Living

— Yi Mei

Bamboo Wife: Since the eastward spread of European customs, the inherent things of our country have been eliminated one by one. For example, the bamboo wife used in summer, I was born late, and I have not had time to see its production; I heard from the late Mr. Sun Shoushiyun: "The bamboo wife is made of Qing bamboo pieces with a width of four or five points, and a length of about three feet. The diameter of the circumference is about six or seven inches, and the whole body is made into a plum blossom pattern, and the air is shared in the middle. In summer nights, it is placed on the mat. When lying down, the arm is clasped to sleep, and those who are fat can make the armpits cool and free from the pain of dirty sweat steaming the skin. In the old days, it was used by people in giant families. Su Dongpo has a poem saying: 'Give you a silent bamboo wife,' which is this thing. It has been around since the Song Dynasty, and its system is very detailed. There are some of these in Shanghai in the bamboo shops on Miezhu Street outside the Dadongmen of Nanshi, and the bamboo craftsmen who make this are clever craftsmen who make dumplings and wontons. The whole body must be unusually shiny and the ends must be hidden. All the joints of the two bamboo strips are embedded in the bottom of the bamboo strips, so that people do not feel prickly. The technique is very precise." According to Mr. Xu Yuedan, "In the past, Guangdong changed the bamboo system to a lacquer leather system, with no connection at both ends, like a long pillow, called a hug pillow." I have not been able to see even this hug pillow, which is really ashamed. The bamboo wife is seen in the books of the predecessors, such as Wu Meicun's Nankeziyun: "Jade bones are fragrant and sweatless, and the two ends are exchanged. They are overturned and hooked, but there is no more Yang belly, so it is romantic. Short and slippery, exquisite and full of sorrow, some personalities are not gentle, afraid of being thrown away in the late autumn." Also, Zhang Juzheng of the Ming Dynasty was hot and restless, and a certain official flattered him and specially made a bamboo wife woven from Xiang bamboo, inlaid with jade to form a pair of mandarin ducks, full of cool and fragrant medicines, smelling the heart and spleen, and Juzheng was very happy. The official was promoted to prominence, which was the power of the bamboo wife. I also heard people say: In the Qing Palace, there was a Qianlong bamboo wife, not made of bamboo, but woven of ivory. Because of the sweat stains on the hands, the color was translucent like red jade, but it was not exhibited in the exhibition of cultural relics in the Forbidden City, and now I don't know where it is lost. What a pity!

Bamboo Shirt: The bamboo shirt is made of fine bamboo and tied with thread to form a square Sheng pore, which is unusually cool. The weaving is extremely fine, otherwise it will be prickly and painful, and the function will be lost. In this summer, dressing neatly and going out to entertain, if the body is not padded, the sweat will penetrate, and it will become a sweaty scholar, which is very unsightly. There were no undershirts and other things at that time, so I had to borrow this bamboo shirt as a lining. Because it is a commonly used product, there are often craftsmen on the streets and alleys who repair bamboo shirts for people, just like the current repair of parasols. Since the sweat shirt has risen, no one uses the bamboo shape anymore; however, the martial students who perform dramas still use bamboo shirts in the summer, because they are prone to sweating through heavy clothes. Besides, it is not often seen. According to legend, there was a bamboo shirt of Qing Zhu Zhuyu, a lyricist, which was unusually exquisite. The fine bamboo was carved with ice plum patterns. The price of things at that time was very low, but this bamboo shirt cost eighty gold, which was offered by a certain student as a congratulatory gift. Those who were frugal all thought that this person was unheard of.

### One Way to Make a Straw Hat New

— Qishi

A straw hat is an indispensable item for going out in the summer. The price is high after the war, and there are many inferior goods. If you simply discard the old and replace it with a new one every year, it is not economical and it is against your conscience. Now there is a method that can make the straw hat new. The method is simple and cheap, and it has been tested by the poor for two years. I dare to introduce it to the readers of this series as follows:

Take a small amount of high-quality stain (dirt) powder used to wipe the basin, etc., and dip a clean old toothbrush into it, mix with an appropriate amount of water, and carefully brush the surface of the green straw hat, making sure that it covers everything. Then use water to wash away the mixture of stain (dirt) powder and dirt, while brushing with a toothbrush. If there are still gray and dirty places, repeat the above method until it is completely clean. Let it dry, and you're done. At this point, the past yellow dirt is as new as ever. The cost is much lower than the cleaning fee. Readers may wish to try it.

### Chatting About Ice Cream

— Ying Dai

As soon as summer unfolds, the cold drink market in Shanghai also unfolds. Among the cold drink foods, generally speaking, ice cream is the most popular. In European and American countries, ice cream is eaten all year round, and the market is of course larger in summer. In China, although ice cream can be bought in winter, not many people eat it. It is not until summer that people buy it to eat.

Just talking about Shanghai, if we make a statistics of the sales volume of ice cream every summer, I am afraid it will be very amazing, right? Among people who love to eat ice cream, we can see that there are more women than men, and most children love to eat ice cream. Under this circumstance, the sales of ice cream naturally increase year by year.

Watermelon was originally a summer food for Chinese people, but in recent years, due to the Sino-Japanese War, Shanghai has become an "isolated island", and the price of watermelon is several times higher than before the war. Most people feel the pain of not being able to afford watermelon? So go and buy ice cream. In fact, ice cream is not necessarily cheaper, but because it is not necessary to buy the whole watermelon, the money is taken out in small pieces, so of course it is not felt.

These days, when we walk to the market, which tobacco shop, candy store, or food store does not open another department to sell cold drinks, and ice cream has become their main selling product. Some people even set up temporary cold drink stalls to sell ice cream. The signs and flags of ice cream are hung everywhere, which has really turned into a world of ice cream!

The main raw materials of ice cream are milk, egg sugar, these things. Due to the high cost in recent years, the price has also risen more than double last year. It is said that making ice cream is very profitable. In the big cities of Europe and the United States, there are many rich people who started their careers because of ice cream. Shanghai's Hai Ning Yanghang now monopolizes the ice cream market.

But although ice cream can relieve summer heat and quench thirst, it should not be eaten too much. If you eat too much, you will easily get sick and cause changes in the stomach. Especially women, if they drink too much, they will have hidden diseases in their physiology. As for cheap and inferior ice cream, it is even more unsuitable to eat. We should keep the so-called "ice cream" in mind and not buy inferior ice cream for cheap, otherwise it will cause problems.

### The Three Pests of Summer

— New Formula

We all know that mosquitoes, flies, and bedbugs are the three pests of summer. As we enter the height of summer, it is also the rampant season for these three types of pests. Therefore, we should know how to defend against them. If we have more common knowledge about them, I think at least you can add a layer of protection to your body. Below, I will share what I know with everyone in a disorganized manner.

Mosquitoes: The common disease called malaria is caused by a type of Anopheles mosquito as its pathogen. Anopheles mosquitoes differ from ordinary mosquitoes in two ways: 1. Anopheles mosquitoes have a slanted body when resting, while ordinary mosquitoes are flat. 2. Anopheles mosquitoes have spots on their wings, while ordinary mosquitoes do not. As for mosquito prevention methods, the basic condition is that everyone should pay attention to hygiene. In addition, burning mosquito coils and pouring kerosene in sewage areas can also eliminate mosquitoes and their larvae. Regarding mosquitoes, there is a terrifying statistic: in Siam, the number of people who die from mosquitoes each year exceeds the number of people who die from tigers by as much as a hundred times. The harm of mosquitoes to humans is evident from this.

Flies: A pair of flies can produce 300 million offspring in a single summer. This rate of reproduction is truly terrifying. Therefore, the work of extermination also needs to be actively carried out. If you have spare time, you may also gather a few companions to form a fly-swatting team. Flypaper, fly swatters, and other tools are used to directly kill adult flies. In toilets or on piles of filth where fly larvae breed, we need to use borax, kerosene, lime, etc., to pour on them in order to eliminate them. Every year, when summer arrives, the health authorities always remind people not to eat food that has been touched by flies, because many seasonal diseases such as dysentery and cholera are mostly directly transmitted by flies. We must pay attention to this. Do not disregard your own precious body for the sake of temporary greed.

Bedbugs: Their bodies are flat and small, so they are extremely difficult to catch. When the human body is stung by this insect, it often feels itchy and painful. At this time, if you apply boric acid water or vinegar, then you will no longer feel itchy and painful. Recently, there are many newly released bedbug-killing agents on the market, and it is said that their effectiveness is quite good.

Summer is the most terrible season. I hope everyone can cherish your body even more. "Being free from illness is a blessing." You need to take care of your own blessings yourself.

### One Week Economic Menu

— Ms. Hua Ying

Among the summer vegetables, gourds occupy an important position, such as winter melon, cucumber, loofah, and the bitter melon that Cantonese people love to eat. A winter melon soup in a Cantonese restaurant is frighteningly expensive, but it is actually very simple to make at home and does not cost much money. You only need to buy a small winter melon, cut it into upper and lower halves, scoop out the seeds and pulp, put ten diced delicacies inside, and finally buy a set of chicken giblets or duck giblets, dice them, and add small pieces of ham, fragrant mushrooms, and side tips, add a little refined salt, cover tightly with fresh lotus leaves, steam until cooked, and when eating, uncover the lotus leaves, the aroma is pleasant, and the ten diced delicacies in the melon are all cooked through, soft and delicious, and the soup is especially fresh and delicious. In summer meat dishes, it can indeed proudly take the top spot.

### Tea Giving and Rice Giving

— Long Ju Sheng

Under the scorching sun, the intense heat is approaching. Sitting in a cramped room, I still feel sweat pouring out like a slurry, frequently calling out for heat. Driven by hunger, I run under the fiery canopy of the sun, those laborers and rickshaw pullers! And the toiling masses? These people carry heavy loads on their shoulders, speeding on the scorching asphalt roads. Their toes are cracked, and their skin is like being burned. What a painful thing that is! I saw the Salvation Army's tea-giving car and rice-giving car stopping by the roadside, giving them immeasurable grace. The laborers, rickshaw pullers, and toiling masses regard them as saviors of their hungry stomachs. People rush to them as if drinking fine wine, as if drinking benevolent nectar, as if reborn! Giving tea and rice can truly be called benevolent nectar and righteous grain. The gentlemen of the Salvation Army, are they also the contemporary counterparts of the woman who fed Han Xin? I am moved by this, so I dip my brush and record it, hoping that the wealthy people on this isolated island will drink a few fewer glasses of iced milk coffee, eat a few fewer cups of lemon ice cream, eat a few fewer servings of cold noodles with shredded chicken, quickly generously contribute with benevolence, and transfer it to the good deeds of giving tea and rice, then it will truly be immeasurable merit!

### Talking About Wine

— Qiu Lang

Wine occupies an important part in the character for "good". Although it is one of the wasteful luxuries, it is always indispensable when there are celebrations and mourning ceremonies. Even in peacetime, friends drink together, buy drunkenness in the market, relatives and friends come and go, and families enjoy themselves, it relies on it as an introduction. Drinkers say even better: "Three cups harmonize all things, a drunken state dissolves a thousand sorrows!" Drinking is not a sin in itself, but it is feared by the word "addiction". With "addiction", one gets drunk early and gets intoxicated late, neglecting public duties, and drinking too much hurts the brain, and the dampness is also extremely heavy. It is very easy to develop dampness diseases. It is best to eat a few cups during festivals and social occasions, which is still harmless. In fact, at this time when the national crisis is severe, other diets still need to be saved, and of course, one should not drink alcohol! The author will roughly excerpt a few pieces about the various types of wine for the readers to enjoy.

Types of wine: There are many types of wine. In terms of domestically produced wines, the most famous in the country is Shaoxing wine. This is certainly due to the perfection of the brewing method, but most of it is also due to the purity of the Jianhu water in the Shaoxing area. It is said that this fine wine cannot be brewed if the location is changed. In addition, Fenjiu from Shanxi is also very well-known. As for sorghum liquor, because of its potency, most of those who like to drink it are from the laboring class, taking it because it is easy to get addicted. As for fruits that can be used to make wine, there are also many, too many to list. Several medicinal wines in Chinese medicine shops are used to activate muscles and bones and treat diseases, which is an exception. When it comes to imported wines, there are also: brandy, beer, whiskey, and so on. However, after the European War, due to transportation difficulties, prices soared. Fortunately, Changyu Company has already produced several domestically produced imitations, which can indeed recover a lot of rights and interests.

Wine stories: There are also many stories about wine, none better than Li Bai's: "Li Bai writes a hundred poems after drinking a bushel of wine, the emperor calls him but he does not board the boat, claiming that he is a wine immortal." It has been passed down as a good story throughout the ages. And for magnanimity and boldness, Liu Ling should be pushed forward. When he drank, he brought a hoe-carrying person with him, meaning that when he was drunk and fell, he would be buried on the spot! In addition, there are Sima Xiangru's exchange of sable fur for wine, and the white-clothed person delivering wine, two tangerines and a bushel of wine, etc., which are also too numerous to enumerate, but they are all deeds that have been broadcast as beautiful stories in history.

Wine quotes: Confucius said: "Only wine is unlimited, but not to the point of chaos." Zhu Xi said, "Do not drink excessive amounts of wine." It can be seen that although sages have no words prohibiting eating, they always persuade people to eat less and not to be excessive. As the proverb says, "Wine is a poison that pierces the intestines," "Wine does not intoxicate people, people intoxicate themselves," "Wine is a medium for lust," and the Buddhist sect's "abstaining from wine and removing meat," either based on cautious eating and seriousness, or based on abstaining from killing and hygiene, these are all warnings to people!

Literati and wine: Drinking alcohol is indeed more harmful than beneficial to the human body, but people prefer to drink alcohol, especially the literati and scholars, who have a connection with koji medicine. And they beautify it by saying: "Poetry and wine linger," like the famous line of the poet sage Li Qinglian when drinking alone: "Raise a glass to invite the bright moon, face my shadow and make three people," his interest is so high, drinking should choose a secluded place, the best is under flowers and moon, sip slowly and gently, in a permanent pavilion, hold the cup and drink a little, wait for slight drunkenness and slight consciousness, after that, either write a topic and chant separately, or connect beautiful lines, feel more happiness, endless fun, compared to the vulgar who only know how to swallow cattle and drink, specializing in drunkenness and causing trouble, cannot be compared.

Spring and Autumn

### Silver and Money Industry Colleagues Consumer Cooperative First Anniversary

— Lai Tian

If readers are not forgetful, I think they must still remember that this newspaper published an article about the consumer cooperative organized by colleagues in the silver and money industry in this city on this day last year. At that time, this consumer cooperative was also the first day of operation. Today, this year, she has worked hard for a year in a difficult environment.

Since the National Army withdrew to the west of Shanghai, evil forces took the opportunity to invade, control, manipulate, hoard... and other means, causing the cost of living to soar and plunge the lives of four or five million citizens into the abyss of suffering, especially the general salary class, which was even more threatened. The colleagues in the silver and money industry, who are known as the "golden rice bowl," also first organized a self-help consumer cooperative due to objective needs. With the great spirit of "everyone for me, I for everyone," they united more than 2,000 colleagues, jointly collected small amounts of capital, and fully exerted their service effectiveness.

On the occasion of her first anniversary, we have briefly written down the situation of the past year's hard work, according to what the author knows, which I don't think is superfluous.

The colleagues in the silver and money industry, in view of the imbalance between their own lives and incomes, urgently need an organized cooperative group to reduce the burden of life for their colleagues. In April last year, with the active preparation of dozens of enthusiastic colleagues and the enthusiastic support of all the financial seniors, the consumer cooperative was formally established, soliciting more than 2,000 members, with shares reaching more than 6,000 yuan, and then started business on the third floor of 334 Nanjing Road on July 30 last year.

In the past year, her turnover was about 30,000 yuan, of which the number of coal balls accounted for a part, and the rest were mostly daily necessities. In terms of pricing, she has always adhered to the eclecticism, so that members have the opportunity to reduce their burdens. The work of purchasing goods is also related to the future of the entire consumer cooperative, so in principle, it is directly purchased from the manufacturers, such as China Chemical Industry Society, Wuhe Weaving Factory, Yitaixing Coal Ball Factory, Guanshengyuan, Taikang... What is regrettable is that many manufacturers do not give consumer cooperatives special preferential rights, but in terms of quantity, it is of course a huge number of about 33,000 yuan.

In addition, she also did general welfare work for the silver and money industry: such as responding to the Shanghai People's Food Maintenance Association and the Shanghai People's Food Regulation Association, and handling small-amount (changed from a minimum of fifty packages to one package) group ordering of foreign rice; and user coal ball pre-purchase method, to maximize the adjustment and service of the necessities of life for members.

Consumer cooperatives in big cities, because of commercial competition, were originally unable to defeat large commercial capitalists with huge funds, but the efforts of the silver and money industry consumer cooperative are not too disappointing to us. Last year, the member purchase dividend was also four cents per yuan, in fact, it has given members the beautiful fruit of "saving without saving."

Recently, during the grand anniversary special offer, she is selling all the goods at a uniform discount, with the intention of commemorating the glorious history of mutual assistance and cooperation among members over the past year, and also giving non-members a very good image, only everyone can sincerely cooperate, to relieve all difficulties and economic oppression.

### Thinking, Seeing, Hearing

— Wei Kang

I heard that an American recently invented a movie that promotes appetite. Watching this movie can increase appetite. Now the price of rice is soaring on this isolated island. If this movie comes to Shanghai, then the price of rice may soar even more. But if someone can invent a movie that makes people lose their appetite and not eat, then the price of rice will definitely fall sharply. I think this is the most effective way to suppress the price of rice.

Hawthorne Detective Cases

### The Overnight Stay of the Dance Queen

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter Four Kind of Deduction

Hawthorne shook his head and said slowly, "I can't accept it. There are two contradictions in this: First, the pistol was shot in from the window, not like it was shot in this room. The sitting posture of the corpse, the bullet hole in the back of the chair, and the bullet on the wall are all clear evidence. Second, we already know that not long after the shot was fired, the three people in the room were all awakened. Judging from the situation, Jinmei and Li Zhiban, after hearing the gunshot, got up, put on their clothes, and went down two flights of stairs to get here, which would probably take no more than three or four minutes at most. Even if the murderer fired the shot inside, in this short period of time, that person would have to hide the pistol, take the bracelet from the deceased's wrist, the ring from his finger, and the earrings from his ears, and then escape, and when escaping, the old man would not hear the sound of his feet, so it can be seen that his steps must not have been too fast, so wouldn't the time be too tight?"

Ni Jinshou nodded secretly and said, "Judging from the injuries of the deceased, the shooter may indeed have been standing outside the short wall to shoot."

Hawthorne nodded and said, "That's right, there's no doubt about it. The first contradiction can be explained. But how to explain the disappearance of the jewelry?"

Ni Jinshou scratched his scalp and said hesitantly, "Maybe—maybe he rushed in to steal her jewelry after firing the shot."

Hawthorne shook his head repeatedly and said, "No, no. You're too confused! The second contradiction I just mentioned is the time problem. Assuming that this person fired the shot in the room and stole the jewelry at random, the time is still too tight. How can you say that he could rush in after firing the shot outside? And the two rows of footprints are neat and orderly, and there is no sound, and it doesn't look like he was rushing, but like he was walking step by step."

Ni Jinshou patted his own forehead and said in frustration, "It's killing me! This kind of case is really too complicated!"

At this time, I suddenly thought of another opinion: "Hawthorne, do you think it's possible that the person who fired the shot and the person with the footprints are two people? The person with the A imprint just came in, and the person outside happened to fire the shot, and the person with the A imprint hurriedly took something and ran away?"

Hawthorne looked up at me and didn't express his opinion. However, even though he didn't express it, he clearly had some sympathy, because he didn't refute it.

He said to himself again, "This question is indeed troubling. Judging from the situation, it looks very much like a jealousy killing, and at the same time, it looks like a murder for money. I really can't find a reasonable explanation now. In addition, the key on the drawer and the banknotes in the drawer, none of them can be understood now... Brother Jinshou, I think it's better to seek some practical facts than to sit and talk about theories." Ni Jinshou said, "How do you plan to proceed?" (59)

### We Await Good News

— Person

About Labor Disputes

The newspapers on the 23rd of this month carried a message that the central authorities were quite concerned about the frequent labor disputes in Shanghai, which made us feel very excited: The central authorities pointed out that "in this extraordinary period, labor and management should share the same boat in the storm and adhere to the spirit of coordination and cooperation." This is something that everyone supports.

In the central government's "Wartime Economic Regulations", it is forbidden to go slow or strike; but we know that in the past one or two years, almost all the go-slow and strike events in Shanghai were caused by the high prices and the failure of the labor side to ask the management side to improve their treatment: we only need to look at the many commercial firms that have automatically improved the lives of their employees, and there have been no labor disputes. This point is even intimately understood by the central authorities thousands of miles away, and the instructions say: "As for the high prices and the difficulties in the livelihoods of the workers, the management side should accept the workers' demands within the possible range, or automatically improve them." I think the wise Shanghai management side should sincerely support this instruction! Also, the same day's newspaper reported that the concession authorities also attached great importance to the labor disputes. It is said that "...at present, the authorities have initially investigated the living standards of various public utilities and factories. If they are indeed meager and difficult to maintain a living, they should discuss improvements with the management authorities to avoid pretexts for strikes." We believe that the concession authorities have done a great deal in the past one or two or three years to resolve labor-management disputes in the concession, but in the past, they still belonged to treating the symptoms, and now there has been a further cure for the root cause. This will make the workers in the concession, and even all the citizens, feel happy, and will even more sincerely support the concession authorities.

Therefore, we await good news.
