### Chinese Side's Responsible Person Reaffirms Determination to Continue Fighting, Confident of Recapturing Hankou and Other Important Towns, Preventing Japanese Military from Taking Risky Southern Advances

Chongqing - The responsible person on the Chinese side here last night reaffirmed China's determination to continue fighting and only accept a fair and honorable peace. It is heard that apart from reports in the news of Tokyo's claims of Japan attempting to negotiate directly with Chongqing, the central government has not heard any new messages from the Japanese side regarding seeking peace. A certain Chinese commentator stated that such messages are clearly Japan resorting to old tricks in order to create a false atmosphere favorable to their plans. We are unmoved by the Japanese threats to recognize the Nanjing "puppet regime." This action by the Japanese shows that after three and a half years of war, they still do not understand the resilience of the Chinese people and still want to impose their version of peace on China.

Washington - Well-informed sources here widely report that someone has proposed a plan to Washington officials to provide China with a loan totaling $200 million, including the purchase of 500 aircraft, so that China can use it to launch large-scale offensives. The Chinese side is confident that it can recapture Hankou and other key locations. The significance of this war is that Japan will not be able to take major risks in Vietnam and southward. According to the proposer of this plan, half of the loan will be used to purchase aircraft, and the other half will be used to consolidate General Chiang Kai-shek's funds for maintaining 1.5 million guerrillas to disrupt Japanese transportation lines. It is said that spending $100 million to maintain this force during the war is worthwhile. (Reuters, 20th)

Chongqing - Official sources here recently stated that they were unaware of the reported Japanese peace proposals. Even if these reports are true, they are nothing more than the Japanese repeating old tricks to create an atmosphere favorable to Japan. Chinese officials also commented on the Japanese side's statement that if Chongqing does not bury the hatchet, Japan will recognize the "Nanjing Government," saying that after three and a half years of war in China, the Japanese still do not understand the spirit and morale of the Chinese nation and do not know whether China can be subdued by force. If China could be subdued by force, it would not be fighting with such determination for so long. (United Press, 20th)

Chongqing - It is reported that the governments of the four northeastern provinces of Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Rehe have suggested to the central government that a secretariat be established before the official organization of the provincial governments to carry out organizational matters. Earlier this year, the National Government appointed chairmen of the four provinces, as there were rumors that China might be willing to give up the four northeastern provinces at the time of Sino-Japanese reconciliation. Therefore, this is a special expression of China's determination to restore the four provinces. (United Press, 20th)

### Japanese Troops Attempt to Land in Saigon, China Blocks Yunnan-Vietnam Traffic, All Passports to Vietnam Suspended, No Goods or Items Allowed to Enter Yunnan from Vietnam, Britain Denies Military Agreement with Thailand

Kunming - The Chinese government completely sealed off the Chinese border with Vietnam yesterday. At the same time, the government cancelled all passports for travel to Vietnam. This blockade affects all traffic between China and Vietnam, including travel, postal services, telecommunications, and trade.

Therefore, since yesterday morning, no people, goods, or mail are allowed to enter Yunnan from Vietnam or enter Vietnam from Yunnan. At the same time, the issuance of permits to enter or pass through these two areas has been suspended. It also stated that since Japan proposed to land in Saigon, the Vietnamese authorities have been trying to avoid discussing the matter with the Japanese. However, the Japanese are now threatening to land in Saigon regardless of whether Vietnam and Vichy can agree. Therefore, the Japanese occupation of Saigon is only a matter of time. (Reuters, 20th)

Washington - People here with close contacts in the Far East predict that Japan will soon attack Saigon and Cam Ranh Bay, and Japanese troops in Vietnam will invade Thailand. According to Tokyo dispatches, Japanese newspapers denounced the Anglo-American encirclement of Japan and warned Thailand and Saigon not to associate with this democratic league. It is believed here that this kind of rhetoric from Japanese newspapers is the usual tactic of the Axis powers before an invasion. However, it is believed that Japanese leaders have not forgotten to advance southward, which must rely on Britain's failure. Therefore, Japan will seize as much territory as possible without provoking Anglo-American action. However, before the Italian navy performs better in the Mediterranean and Germany achieves more victories over Britain, it will probably not take any action against Hong Kong, Singapore, or the Dutch East Indies. (Reuters, 20th)

London - British authorities yesterday absolutely denied the news in Japanese newspapers about a secret Anglo-American-Thai military agreement. The authorities believe that this news, which has been heavily promoted by Japanese newspapers in Tokyo, is "completely unfounded." The authorities said that the publication of this news "makes us pay closer attention to the development of the situation." British authorities view this Anglo-American-Thai agreement reported by Japan as a kite being flown in the air. The authorities said that this action raises "speculation as to why Japan is flying this kite." Officials ridiculed Japan's attempt to create the impression that the United States and the United Kingdom are trying to disrupt relations between Thailand and Vietnam in order to trap Vichy. The authorities said that this news is completely untrue. (United Press, 20th)

France Replaces Vietnamese Officials

The Vichy government recently issued an order to replace high-ranking officials stationed in various protectorates and colonies in Vietnam, such as (1) Dur√©, the commissioner stationed in the protectorate of Laos, has been assigned to another position and ordered to return to the country immediately.

(3) Lieuvya, a first-class civil servant in Vietnam, is immediately appointed as the acting governor of the colony of Cochinchina. (4) Winterpet, the labor supervisor stationed in Vietnam, has been assigned to another position and ordered to return to the country immediately. (Havas, 19th)

Hanoi - General Decoux, the Governor-General of Vietnam, issued a letter to the Vietnamese people today, once again denying various rumors circulating outside.

Fortunately, the Vietnamese people have always been knowledgeable and realistic. From now on, they will only scoff at these purely fabricated and meaningless rumors and will not be misled. (Havas, 19th)

Singapore - The Thai Consul-General here today issued a formal statement denying the Japanese report that Thai and Vietnamese troops had clashed in the forests along the Mekong River in southeastern Thailand.

Tokyo - The "Miyako Shimbun" warned Thailand yesterday not to "engage in immoral behavior towards Japan." The warning was published in an editorial attacking the rumored secret Anglo-American-Thai military agreement. "Miyako Shimbun" pointed out that Thailand had indeed signed a friendship treaty with Japan in June. The newspaper also said that the rumor that Britain had offered guarantees to Thailand, saying it would help Thailand recover lost territory belonging to Vietnam, would not materialize, "because Britain's fate in this European war has already been decided." "Miyako Shimbun" also said that Japan cannot allow any of Japan's enemies to acquire territorial benefits. The warning, which is directed at Thailand not to take "immoral actions," implies that entering into a secret military agreement with the UK and US would constitute such an "immoral action." (United Press, 20th)

Tokyo - A semi-official Japanese source denied today the widespread rumors abroad that Japan intends to move troops into southern Vietnam. At the same time, according to various sources, Japan's new peace proposal has been completely rejected by China. It is also rumored here that various parties close to the American military have expressed the opinion that the plan to build an air base in the Philippines is part of an Anglo-American plan to establish a chain of bases from the Philippines to Thailand to protect India and Australia. When this rumor occurred, there was excitement in Tokyo. According to news from Japan, 200 American aviators recently transferred from Shanghai to the Philippines to strengthen the island's air defense. (International News Service, 20th)

### The Turbulent European Situation and Japan's Southern Advance

In the past ten days or so, the diplomatic offensive of the Axis countries has shown unprecedented activity: after Molotov's visit to Germany, it was followed by Antonescu and Sonnann's visits to Germany and Italy. Sonnann also held a meeting with the foreign ministers of Germany and Italy in Salzburg; and the Central European Conference including Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and the Balkans will be held in Vienna by Germany and Italy in the coming days. In addition, military leaders from both Germany and Italy also held a military conference in Innsbruck, Austria on the 15th. All this shows that the diplomatic and military situation in Europe will have a dramatic development in the future. Regardless of whether it can save the reputation and decline of the Axis countries, it can be seen that the German and Italian authorities are looking around and striving for development. And what attitude and steps Japan, another ally of Germany and Italy, will take at this time is naturally a matter of great attention.

The signing of the Tripartite Pact is now nearly two months ago. Although the inside operation process cannot be fully known to the world, judging from the facts in all aspects, it is credible that Germany, Italy, and Japan have not gained anything from the alliance. And their actions have not been fully coordinated, and even the Tripartite Joint Technical Committee stipulated in Article 4 of the alliance has not been able to hold a meeting "as soon as possible" to obtain a power plan for political, economic, and military mutual assistance. Until recently, Germany and Italy's various arrangements and operations were almost completely unrelated to Japan - only the Vienna conference, which is about to be held, is said to invite Japanese Ambassador to Germany Kurusu to participate - Japan's various gestures to ease relations with the United States seem to be inconsistent with the original intention of the Tripartite Pact. Allied countries that act independently like this are almost as if there is no connection between them. Although Japan has tried its best to lobby and coordinate with all parties, it is not based on the common interests of the three countries, but only focuses on its own needs. This situation is indeed confusing to some people.

However, the conclusion of the Tripartite Pact, although both parties are just trying to entertain themselves in desperation, will not have been without careful planning. Some say: if the negotiations between the three countries had not come to an end in September, when the decline of Germany and Italy was not fully revealed, it might have followed the same path as the Hiranuma era and declared a failure again. This observation is only a partial truth, only seeing the dark side of the relationship between the three countries and ignoring their need for mutual collusion. Germany and Italy being blocked in Europe and Japan's strength nearing exhaustion have long been known to each other. It is precisely because of this that there is a need for mutual support and response. The main central issue here is Germany and Italy's offensive against Britain and Japan's southern advance. The southern advance is the one thing that can best exert the effect of mutual collusion. Moreover, the southern advance has become the only way out for Japan at this time. The greater the international pressure, the more urgent the need for the southern advance. Whether it immediately leads to armed conflict, or whether it is economic or political in nature, it will inevitably divert the attention of Britain and the United States and contain their strength. Therefore, if Japan is more aggressive, Germany and Italy will naturally be happy to hear it and strive to promote it. If Japan is slow to advance, Germany and Italy will feel impatient, but they will not be too demanding, because Japan's lack of strength is a well-known fact, and Germany and Italy cannot provide strong support. Therefore, even if Japan is only doing various plans for itself, as long as it does not abandon the fundamental route of the southern advance, it cannot be quickly concluded that they are superficially united.

Because of the following factual constraints, Japan's recent southern advance strategy has been more focused on gradual progress and economic aspects. First, Japan's current situation still requires considerable preparation to await a more favorable opportunity. Second, under internal and external economic pressure, it has to urgently seek considerable resources to alleviate its immediate needs. The Japanese government's recent diplomatic offensive towards the United States is intended to delay American pressure and sanctions, and to try to absorb the final economic benefits before commercial relations with the United States are completely closed. At the same time, it is also sending envoys to the Dutch East Indies, Vietnam, and even Central and South America to conduct commercial negotiations in order to seize resources as much as possible. However, these are only partial aspects of Japan's southern advance attempt. On the other hand, it has also been preparing for military action in a posture of waiting for an opportunity. Its peace offensive against China and the withdrawal of troops from the southern battlefield are all part of this preparation. The statement made by Japanese Admiral Takahashi the other day that Japan and the United States must eventually fight is certainly a probe for both inside and outside, and it is not necessarily a statement of his inner understanding. The Imperial Conference convened by Japan on the 13th is said to have discussed the "China Incident" and concluded that it should induce China to make peace or recognize the Nanjing organization. It is expected that there will also be a major consideration on how to adjust or shorten the war line in China in order to withdraw its strength for southern advance preparations. People should not underestimate the major crisis in the South Pacific because Japan's recent external gestures have been relatively moderate and focused on economic operations.

The recent new developments in the European situation are naturally an opportunity for Japan to engage in new adventures. Although Germany and Italy are in an unfavorable state, their future attempts may not be able to break through Britain's nets and rebuild the axis's advantage. However, in any case, Japan will not easily let go of the favorable factors of the turbulent European situation. If Kurusu is really invited to participate in the Vienna Conference this time, it further implies that Germany and Italy's expectations of Japan and the collusion between them have reached a new stage due to the evolution of the European and Asian situation. At present, the entire future of the South Pacific remains to be determined, and all parties need to pay close attention. The precariousness of Saigon and the overall situation in Vietnam is no different from that of northern Vietnam two months ago. Hopefully, it will not become a continuation of northern Vietnam due to the lack of vigilance of the countries concerned.

### Construction in Yunnan to be Shown in Chongqing
Chongqing ‚Äì Yunnan Province Chairman Long Yun once gave a speech regarding welcoming overseas Chinese to invest in Yunnan and develop Fuyuan.

Afterwards, cinematographers from China Film Studio went to various places in Yunnan Province to capture scenery of rich resources and famous landmarks, as well as new constructions, etc. The filming took many months and the footage obtained was extremely rich and used to be inserted into the speech. Recently, the entire project has been completed and named "Construction in Yunnan". It will be premiered in this city in the coming days.

As for the current third five-year plan, the Soviet Union will build an incredibly powerful navy. Soviet industry is currently manufacturing submarines in large quantities, and all machinery is domestically produced. As a result, the Soviet submarine fleet has become one of the most powerful fleets in the world, no less impressive than the world's largest fleets." (20th Dispatch from TASS)

Hungary Signs Protocol, Joins Axis Pact
Using the Construction of a New Order as a Slogan, a Scene from the Vienna Conference
Vienna ‚Äì Hitler arrived in Vienna this morning. (20th Dispatch from Huitong News Agency)

Vienna ‚Äì An official announcement from Vienna this afternoon stated that the foreign ministers of Germany, Italy, and Hungary, along with the Japanese ambassador to Germany, signed a protocol today, the main points of which are as follows:

(1) Hungary joins the alliance signed by Germany, Italy, and Japan in Berlin on September 27th of this year. (2) Representatives from Hungary will participate in discussions in the Joint Technical Committee on matters concerning the interests of Hungary. (3) The provisions of the German-Italian-Japanese alliance are attached to this protocol.

This protocol has four copies, one each in German, Italian, Japanese, and Hungarian, all with equal validity and effective from the date of signing. (20th Dispatch from Huitong News)

Vienna ‚Äì Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki and Foreign Minister Cs√°ky arrived at the East Station here at 10:00 AM this morning. The station was adorned with the flags of Germany, Italy, and Hungary. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, who had arrived yesterday, were also at the station to welcome them. Ribbentrop and Ciano were wearing gray military uniforms, while the Hungarian dignitaries were in civilian clothes. Vienna Mayor Schirach and party, government, and military officials were also at the station to welcome them. Hungarian Ambassador to Germany General Stoeger also participated in the welcome. The German Ambassador to Hungary, Erdmannsdorff, arrived here in the same car as the Hungarian dignitaries. Japanese Ambassador to Germany Kurusu, who had just arrived here, was unable to attend the welcome at the station. After inspecting the honor guard, the dignitaries from Germany, Italy, and Hungary drove to the Bristol Hotel. The crowd lined the streets to welcome them. Japanese Ambassador to Germany Kurusu also stayed at the Bristol Hotel, while Ribbentrop stayed at the Imperial Hotel and Ciano stayed at the Grand Hotel, all located close to each other. The protocol was signed at the Palais at 12:30 PM. Hungary thus became the first country in the Balkans to join the German-Italian-Japanese pact. Political figures here believe that three more countries will announce their participation in this pact. They indicated that Romanian Prime Minister General Antonescu has expressed his intention to visit Berlin. (20th Dispatch from Huitong News)

Vienna ‚Äì After announcing the signing of the protocol for Hungary's participation in the German-Italian-Japanese pact, German leader Hitler held a banquet at the Palais with the guests. Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki, Hungarian Foreign Minister Cs√°ky, Japanese Ambassador to Germany Kurusu, and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop all participated. (20th Dispatch from Huitong News)

Tokyo ‚Äì It was announced here today that Hungary has joined the tripartite pact signed by Germany, Italy, and Japan in September. According to a spokesperson from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, this move will undoubtedly contribute to achieving the basic objectives of the tripartite pact and enhancing the respective positions of Japan, Germany, and Italy in the Greater East Asia and European regions. The spokesperson also pointed out that Hungary is the first country to join this pact, stating that Hungary's participation has opened the path for other countries to join successively.

German and Hungarian Foreign Ministers Issue Statements
Vienna ‚Äì German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop issued a statement immediately after announcing the signing of the protocol for Hungary's participation in the German-Italian-Japanese pact at 12:35 PM today. He stated briefly that other countries will also participate in the tripartite pact. In addition to reporters from Germany, Italy, Japan, and Hungary, news reporters from Romania, Bulgaria, and Slovakia were invited to participate in the signing ceremony, indicating that these countries will also participate in the tripartite pact. Ribbentrop also stated the three objectives of the pact: (1) to construct a world order, (2) to defeat countries attempting to expand the war, and (3) to restore world peace. He expressed great satisfaction that Hungary has announced its participation in this effort. (20th Dispatch from Huitong News)

Vienna ‚Äì Before signing the protocol, Hungarian Foreign Minister Cs√°ky read out the Hungarian government's statement, which stated briefly that Hungary, bound by the Treaty of Paris, was able to lift this unfair situation with the assistance of the Axis powers. Hungary expressed its deep gratitude. The tripartite pact of Germany, Italy, and Japan, with the ultimate goal of a fair and lasting world peace, does not target any country. Hungary is still willing to maintain friendly relations with neighboring countries that respect Hungary's rights. Article 5 of the tripartite pact stipulates that the pact does not change relations with the Soviet Union, which Hungary welcomes. Hungary's participation in the tripartite pact is intended to consolidate the new order in Southeast Europe. People here point out that this protocol is the first alliance concluded between Germany and Hungary since 1918. (20th Dispatch from Huitong News)

Developments in the Balkans, Turkey is Deeply Wary
Istanbul ‚Äì Since receiving news that leader Hitler had met with King Boris of Bulgaria, there is deep fear that the war may immediately extend to the Turkish border. Authoritative sources say that, to save face, Italy may not need Germany to assist in the war against Greece. Therefore, Germany may force Bulgaria to intervene in the Italian-Greek war to assist Italy. It is also believed that Germany is currently exerting every effort to ensure that Turkey guarantees to continue maintaining its neutral status. Authoritative sources also say that German Ambassador to Turkey Papen's return here may be related to this matter. (20th Dispatch from United Press)

Ankara ‚Äì Members of the Turkish People's Party in Parliament, who have always supported the government, held a secret meeting yesterday to discuss the current international situation. It is reported that these parliamentarians have received the content of the report that Ambassador Charrit sent to the government in Germany. The meeting was held after newspapers published the German Ambassador Papen's statement that Turkey would participate in the new European order. Regarding this matter, the German side has not yet confirmed it, but this news has aroused close attention in Turkish political circles, because unless approved by the Turkish Foreign Ministry, the Turkish official news agency would never dare to publish such startling news. (20th Dispatch from Huitong News)

Bulgaria Joins the Axis, Still Does Not Forget Territorial Demands
Sofia ‚Äì Bulgarian newspapers are now continuing to advocate for obtaining access to the Aegean Sea and recovering Western Thrace. "Duma" newspaper stated that Bulgaria is prepared to negotiate these goals through peaceful means and restore Greek-Bulgarian friendship. The newspapers all published the news of King Boris's visit to Hitler in large characters, but did not offer criticism. (20th Dispatch from Reuters)

London ‚Äì It is rumored that King Boris told Hitler in Berchtesgaden that he would allow German troops to pass through Bulgaria to attack Greece. Therefore, there are now five fully equipped German divisions in Bulgaria, and it is expected that a blitzkrieg will be launched against Greece within 48 hours. Bulgarian sources in London recently denied the above statement, saying that there are no German troops in Bulgaria. (20th Dispatch from Reuters)

Rome ‚Äì The Italian "News" newspaper considers King Boris's visit to Hitler "the most important political event in history" and has rendered British attempts to persuade Bulgaria to adopt an anti-Axis policy ineffective. (20th Dispatch from Huitong News)

German-Spanish Negotiations Concluded, Agreement Soon to be Signed
Basel ‚Äì The Swiss "Basler Zeitung" reports from Rome that Spain and the Axis powers are expected to sign a definitive agreement in the coming days, leading to "activities of some kind." Roman political circles believe that the discussions between the two sides have now concluded, and the situation will soon develop. Furthermore, the newspaper's Berlin dispatch stated that German officials are adhering to the army, led by Soner, while informed sources said that the negotiations with Spain have now concluded. (20th Dispatch from Reuters)

Hitler's Efforts, Difficult to Reconcile Soviet-Spanish Relations
London ‚Äì The "Daily News" editorial is titled "Hitler's Two Faces", saying that Hitler, after just expressing goodwill to Molotov, hastily invited the Spanish Foreign Minister to visit Berchtesgaden, which is very awkward. There is obviously something suspicious in this. Hitler's anti-communism is just a propaganda technique, and the truth has now been revealed. Spain is not like this, and its anti-communism is more genuine. How can Hitler's flirtation with Moscow be reconciled with his friendship with Spain? This is a question that Spain cannot help but ask. Even if Hitler reconnects with Soner about Spain's assistance to Germany in attacking Britain, the meeting between Mr. Xi and General Franco last month did not produce any effect, so this decision to reconnect should also be invalid. Not to mention the German-Soviet talks, the loss of the Italian battleship in Taranto and the defeat of the Italian army in the war against Greece cannot make Spain easily believe Mr. Xi's sweet words, not to mention that there is now reason to believe that powerful figures in Spain, including military leaders, are now eager to avoid war. "The Times" foreign correspondent commented on Western Foreign Minister Soner's visit to Germany, saying that Hitler seems willing to reiterate to General Franco that Germany's invitation to Molotov has no ideological significance, but is only a strategy to help win the war. Will Mr. Xi fulfill his previous promise to cede French North African territory to expand the territory of Italy and Spain, or has the request of Italy and Spain been abandoned when discussing with Marshal P√©tain? It seems that the two governments in Italy and Spain cannot help but doubt this. When Molotov visited Germany, Germany seemed to promise to provide the Soviet Union with technical assistance to help it build a navy and promised not to attack Turkey at present, in exchange for the Soviet Union's supply of aircraft parts.

Rumors of Freezing Chinese Deposits, the United States Knows Nothing
Treasury Department Issues Statement
Washington ‚Äì A spokesman for the US Treasury Department stated yesterday that he had never heard of rumors at home and abroad that the United States would freeze Chinese deposits in the United States, and solemnly declared that the US Treasury Department had no knowledge of this measure. It is said that the US President believes that he can order the immediate freezing of funds of any foreign country deposited in the US when necessary, etc. Recently, some non-official parties have advocated that the US freeze deposits of foreign countries other than the Western Hemisphere, so as to contain the aggressor countries, but a licensing system should still be applied so that the funds needed by China and the UK can still be released. However, the State Department announced last night that the department was not aware of any plans related to this matter. The origin of this statement should be an essay published in a newspaper, but the essay was not based on official opinions. (20th Dispatch from United Press Agency)

Nazi Night Hawks Raid Britain on a Large Scale, Midland District Suffers Frenzied Bombing, Bombs Rain Down for Nine Hours, Coventry Tragedy Repeated
London ‚Äì An Air Ministry communiqu√© stated that last night German aircraft attacked the Midland district of Britain with a major focus. The scale was very large, starting after nightfall and continuing for nine hours. Many incendiary and high-explosive bombs were dropped, causing considerable damage in several districts, with several major fires, all of which have been brought under control. Housing and other buildings in one district were severely damaged, but damage elsewhere was not serious. Detailed reports have not yet arrived. There must be some casualties, but in terms of the scale of the offensive, the number of casualties is relatively small. Bombs also fell in several other places in Britain, including the London area and the Suloran district. The attacks on London were not large-scale, but intermittent throughout the night, with slight material damage and limited casualties. Losses in other places were minor, with very few casualties. At least five enemy bombers were shot down last night. (20th Dispatch from Reuters)

London ‚Äì From last night until this morning, German aircraft concentrated on attacking the Midlands. After a town suffered a heavy, torrential-storm-like attack for ten hours, another town in the same area was attacked again using the same means as the recent bombing of Coventry. One team after another of attackers flew lower than usual, and after crossing the East Anglian coast, they indiscriminately dropped bombs of various forms and calibers in the area. A certain town suffered particularly severely, and another town, which had recently suffered a tragedy, was attacked for the second time yesterday. Up to two towns were "blessed" with a large number of fire bombs, causing countless major fires. Firefighters wearing helmets were struggling to put out the fires as bombs and shells rained down. Throughout the area from the east coast to the Midlands, anti-aircraft fire was dense and continuous, forming almost a huge curtain of fire, causing most of the attackers' formations to be scattered, and many were forced to unload their bombs among rural huts, but these places suffered very little damage. The alarm in London was lifted at 7:00 a.m. today, an hour earlier than usual. (20th Dispatch from Taiwan Public News)

Berlin ‚Äì Last night, a large force of German aircraft, departing late at night from bases in France, Belgium, Holland Valley, launched a large-scale attack on the town of Birmingham in the Midlands this morning. In a sunny and breezy atmosphere, waves of German aircraft continuously flew over the city, dropping thousands of various bombs on military factories, other military targets, and public utilities. The entire city was shrouded in more than twenty major fires. Later aircraft used the raging fire as a target, so there was no difficulty in finding their destination. The effectiveness of anti-aircraft artillery was very small. In addition, London and southern cities were heavily bombed by German aircraft. (20th Dispatch from Huitong News Agency)

Coventry after the Bombing, Tragic Situation, Historical City Becomes Ruins, Victims Buried in Cemetery
Stockholm, Sweden ‚Äì According to a London dispatch carried in the "Aftonbladet", thick smoke still fills the entire city of the British industrial city of Coventry. It is impossible to determine how many fires there are. The city is almost completely in ruins, like an earthquake. Large groups of men, women, old people, and children are waiting for medical treatment in front of the hospitals. Ambulances are injecting typhoid fever prevention vaccines everywhere, and drinking water must be boiled before it can be taken. According to Production Minister Morrison, the rubble in the city has been demolished by soldiers, and there is no danger of walking under it. (20th Dispatch from Huitong News)

London ‚Äì The remains of the people who died in the heavy bombing of Coventry last week will be transported by a convoy of trucks covered with the national flag at 11 a.m. today to be buried in the local cemetery to form a public tomb. When peace is restored, an appropriate monument will be built on the tomb. The work of clearing the rubble is still in progress, and bodies will be unearthed, so the number of victims will increase. The people whose homes have been destroyed have received sympathy and financial assistance from all parties and have been given arrangements. The Chairman of the London County Council, Tavio, telegraphed the elders of Kirk and Terry, saying, "I extend my deep sympathy to all of you and the citizens of the historic city of Coventry. The people of London express their respect to your proud spirit and courage. Please let us know if there is anything we can do to help." The British ship "Coventry Command." also sent a telegram saying, "All the officers and soldiers of the Coventry express their deep sympathy for the suffering of the residents of Coventry, and assure them that this ship will definitely make the enemy suffer this too." Coventry has received many other letters and telegrams, with attached checks, such as a contribution of one million pounds from the Mayor of London. (20th Dispatch from Reuters)

British Aircraft Bomb Berlin Center, German Industrial Production Greatly Affected

London ‚Äì The Information Office of the British Air Ministry announced today that the Krupp Munitions Factory in Essen, the largest in Germany, has had its output halved due to an air strike by the US Air Force. Some parts of the factory have been closed, and other parts cannot be relocated, and many railway junctions have been damaged, making transportation difficult, so it is very difficult to obtain raw materials on time. One part of the factory was hit by a bomb and lost its working ability, and a particularly heavy giant bomb penetrated an underground factory and exploded. According to news received by the United Kingdom, the repeated heavy attacks on cities in western Germany by the British Air Force have caused increasingly serious obstacles to industry.

Painful History of the European War (3), Three Protagonists in the French Tragedy
(2) Gamelin, Who Could See But Not Do
My conversation with Gamelin involved returning to Belgium for a trip. I asked him about the German offensive he had just mentioned, whether it would come via Belgium.

He said: "This is very likely. But we must also consider that the enemy may not only attack Holland and Belgium, but launch a full-scale attack from the mouth of the Rhine to the Swiss border."

I asked: "When does the commander think the German army will begin its offensive?"

He bit his lip and thought for a moment before answering: "The end of January? I don't think so. Mid-March is closer." He pondered for a while, changed his tone, and said: "May, yes, May is almost certainly certain." He made this amazing prediction, still calm and composed, which surprised me. General Gamelin seemed to have the future development clearly in his mind, not taking it lightly, but at least not fearing it. If what he said is true, wouldn't it be a great fortune for France to catch up quickly and do its best to replenish the air force during this period of calm on the Western Front?

He said calmly and firmly: "Yes, by mid-March our preparations will just reach the standard."

I continued: "Speaking of tanks, the Belgian side told me that they have the most excellent anti-tank guns." Gamelin replied: "That's right."

There was a clock hanging on the wall, and I had been staring at it. Now I look at the clock and know that I have been there for an hour and ten minutes. During the conversation, I repeatedly expressed that I should not disturb him, but Gamelin always waved his hand and said: "It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter, you haven't disturbed me at all."

During this hour and ten minutes, the phone never rang, and there was not even a knock on the door. It was really quiet all around. Finally, I excused myself and said goodbye.

Before leaving, he smiled slightly and said: "Of course, you will keep what you see and hear on the front line a secret and not reveal it. We'll see you again when we come back. We'll be happy to hear any advice."

I returned from inspecting the front line on the night of the 24th. I thought that instead of directly asking Gamelin to take the time to meet, it would be better to write him a brief report to imply a request to meet. I am an amateur in military affairs, and it is inevitable that I will be ridiculed if I talk nonsense, so I tried to be careful in my wording, and used a tactful style to reveal my opinions between the lines. But there were really a lot of shortcomings that I saw, and Gamelin was the best person to correct these shortcomings in France. Therefore, I ventured to urge him to pay attention in the report.

For example, regarding the first line of defense, I said: "There are too few shelters for defense against bombing, and there are no trenches that can be used as shelters, which is surprising. I asked the officers how to do it at that time. They said that they... have forests, drill holes, or lie in low-lying areas."

Regarding the Maginot Line, I said: "Just by paying a little attention, people who slightly look at the outer line will feel that it is not satisfactory. The tank traps seem too hasty, and the trenches are too few. Although the barbed wire obstacles have not been neglected, their depth and length are still not enough.

Regarding the main forts of the defense line: "Although I am not proficient in this field, and what I have seen is only superficial, I have to say: I am afraid that the power of the fort's fire network is not enough to match the solid and magnificent steel and concrete works. The effectiveness of this kind of well-protected giant cannon is far from comparable to field artillery. If the enemy launches a full-scale attack, whether it can control the front and sides with a dense and wide fire network, making it difficult for them to cross the minefield, it is not without doubt."

I also mentioned the army generals' complaints about the air force, and that the life of the troops close to the front was not tense enough, which was dangerous. Although the tone of my report was very humble, a discerning person like Gamelin should not have found it difficult to understand the great significance of my implication." He did not reply to this report, nor did he invite me to meet, and there was no chance to see him again from then on.

Now let's talk about Gamelin's merits and demerits. After the disaster struck, some people attacked Gamelin for his muddling through and delaying the military opportunity, which shows that they were talking nonsense and did not know what they were talking about. Laineau said at the end of May that what was lacking was intellectual application. The implication was that he intended to replace Gamelin, but what he said was not realistic. On the whole, Gamelin had a wise head and did not speculate out of thin air. He spoke about strategy and tactics, all of which were pertinent, and the subsequent developments were especially in line with the reality.

Some people also said: "Gamelin's rapid rise was entirely due to flattery and good flattery, and entirely due to the promotion of politicians and bureaucrats." These people do not know that if a soldier wants to be promoted to a high position, he must rely on politicians. Their military value has not been diminished as a result. Isn't Napoleon's success due to his efforts to win over politicians? Are the German generals now invincible because of politics? But we have to go a step further and say that the selection of generals is best decided by non-military politicians, and should not allow people in the military to block the road for talented people, so that genius cannot show itself. Was it politicians or soldiers who buried Bestergor's talents?

Or it can be said that although Gamelin predicted the situation in mid-May, he did not move his troops, so the troops under his command were waiting to die, and he could not be blamed. Although he confided in me and talked for more than an hour, I was not afraid of criticism and pointed out to him the situation on the front line, which was not very satisfactory. Although it was a euphemistic suggestion, it still made him feel unhappy.

I think the following comments may not be far from the truth. This person must have great intelligence. His ideas do not like to be changed easily, and he even tries to avoid any environment that may change his ideas. It is said that he does not often inspect the front line, and it is rare to go to the military zone. As the commander of the Allied forces, his footprints never leave the residences of Weissenburg and Tarati. He also travels between London and Chiksenburg for the meetings of the Supreme Military Council of the Allied forces in London. His staying at home is definitely not due to fear of any danger, nor can it be said that he is due to mental fatigue. Perhaps he is afraid of trouble and afraid of discovering unpleasant things.

There are many people whose intelligence and ability to act are too disproportionate, and Gamelin is one such person! What is the reason? The first is the lack of willpower. This kind of person only has thoughts, but no determination to carry them out. This kind of person is afraid of action, and even more afraid of the consequences of action. Herleau has already said this with emotion, and the bureaucratic atmosphere in the General Staff has made him even more lazy to act.

This kind of person is fundamentally a visionary. It is well known that visionaries often have very clear thoughts.

For example, a visionary engineer dreams day and night about how to build gorgeous houses and mansions. They have thought of everything in terms of construction, only forgetting the one thing they must do, which is to take action.

It is rare in the world for a visionary to become the Commander-in-Chief of the French Army and the Commander of the Allied Forces. He dreams of tanks, but does not care about the reality of the small number of tanks; he also dreams of a blitzkrieg that will happen in May, but does not know how to deal with it, making it difficult for the enemy to win and seizing victory in his own hands, which is too sad.

Free Talk	Jesus as Lord of My Heart (5) (5) Jesus - Lord of Affections: (Jesus.Lordof the Affectlons) People's hearts are the most sacred thing, and that is love. Proverbs 4:23: "Guard your heart above all else, for it is the source of life." Many people have experienced failure in life because they use their emotions improperly or on unworthy things. The crisis of life is never as important as when love is revealed. It is also the hub of life. A person's happiness in life is determined by the relationships that arise from love. In this light, honoring Christ as the Lord of Love is indeed a pressing matter. "Devoutly dedicate my heart, belonging to the Lord, worthy to be the Lord's abode;" We must never let love run wild, indulging in desires and doing whatever we want. Always take Christ as the scope of using emotions, and honor Him as Lord in everything. No one in the world has loved us like He has, and no one has shown such love as He has. Each of us can say, "The Son of God loved me and gave Himself for me." We should respond to this great love with true devotion and a willing heart. In our view, true love has three conditions: (1) Adoration: Psalm 73:25 says, "Whom have I in heaven but you? And earth has nothing I desire besides you." God likes us to adore Him. We should learn from the prophet Isaiah, who said, "Your name and renown are the desire of our hearts" (Isaiah 26:8). (2) Delight: Love must have an object of delight. God delights in his own people, so every one of God's people can say, "He rescued me because he delighted in me" (Psalm 18:19). So we delight in him, as the Psalmist says, "Take delight in the Lord" (Psalm 37:4). (3) Dedication: If a person's love is compiled by Jesus, he should devoutly dedicate himself and be happy to serve the Lord. With the love of Jesus, we should not live only for ourselves, but for the Lord who died and rose again for us. In this way, there will be no misuse of emotions, and no wandering aimlessly in love. Their love will be sacred and controlled by Jesus. Readers who want to know more details, please write to the Shanghai Aiwenyi Road 351 Literary Evangelism Society, and there will be detailed answers.

Night Shift Work Stirring
Five weeks of night shift life have passed, and this should be the last week. For the sake of work and responsibility, I always have to find ways to make myself feel very interested and hopeful when I am on duty at night.

At eight o'clock, as usual, we started our work under the red light. The ward was immersed in darkness, except for the moans of a patient in bed number sixteen with a broken leg. The most agitated patient with ruptured peritonitis had died during the day.

In the dim light of the flashlight, I tidied up the beds for the patients, added blankets, and made the patients close their eyes. Then, I followed the doctor's orders and prepared hot compresses, gave medicines, gave food, wiped backs, and other treatments.

Around eleven o'clock, I finished these things, and it was time for dinner. Another classmate replaced me in the ward. When I was eating, I wanted to make myself more excited, but it seemed a little impossible. The food seemed to have turned bitter, and even the things I liked to eat during the day, I now found annoying.

In the middle of the night, the ward was even quieter. I had to move more lightly beside the beds, carefully pulling the blankets up to the patients' bodies. All twenty patients slept very well, and even the patient with the broken leg in bed number sixteen was fast asleep because he had taken sleeping pills. The patients no longer asked me for water or helped them turn over. I had to sit down at my desk too.

The dim light was weakly shining. I picked up a book on nursing ethics, preparing to flip through it. After reading it for half an hour, my eyes began to blur, and I couldn't remember what I had read. After walking around the ward once, I sat down again, afraid that the sound of my footsteps would wake the patients.

The pendulum of the clock outside the room seemed particularly harsh tonight. The night was passing too slowly. If I were still doing the day shift now, I certainly wouldn't want the night to be longer. Sleep is sweet. Those who have done the night shift will appreciate this. However, I knew very well that sweetness should not be mine. I should guard, guard! No matter how deep and beautiful the temptation of this night is.

I stood up, wiping my eyes. I tried desperately to focus my eyes on each patient. I hoped they would move slightly, and I wanted them to ask for water, even if they coughed once, as long as it could invigorate my spirit, nothing would bother me. But, they didn't do that. They all slept very well.

At two o'clock in the morning, I sat down to write the report, and then prepared to write the diary. The light seemed dimmer than before, and I had a strange feeling in my heart. Thinking that I only slept for five and a half hours during the day (because I had to get up for class at three thirty in the afternoon), I felt even more exhausted and unable to support myself. I gradually fell into a daze. Was I asleep? I couldn't believe it, but I had to believe it, because my pen told me - I was dozing off - it was no longer in my hand, it fell on the ground, and the nib was crushed by my foot. I felt terrified. I started to get confused. I was afraid that the patient in bed number two had taken out the drainage tube from the wound, and I was even more afraid that the patient in bed number six had loosened the bandage. After checking on them, I realized that my fantasies were wrong.

It was almost dawn, and the patients were still sleeping quietly. A ray of light shone through the horizon. I was very clear-headed. An inexplicable feeling violently attacked me. Why did I actually fall asleep? I began to hate myself - I hated my head, eyes, hands, feet - as long as it was a part of my body, I hated it, because they made me do the most painful thing - made me doze off. I didn't want to do this, but I did it unconsciously. I knew how dangerous this was for the patients, I knew my job and mission. But, could I completely hate myself? No, it was this system of eleven hours of night work and five and a half hours of daytime sleep that made us like this. However, I shouldn't hate anyone. In the struggle to win national liberation, we should work even harder. However, excessive fatigue will hinder work.

For the sake of the patients, for the sake of the hospital, I hope that the people in charge of every hospital can change the night shift hours so that we can fulfill our responsibilities, and I also hope that people who are enthusiastic about serving the public will constantly give us pure guidance and criticism so that the future of the entire nursing profession will turn towards a bright path!

### Hawthorne's Detective Work The Homecoming of the Dancing Queen by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter 11 Zhao Boxiong's Confession

Hawthorne continued, "Why are you staring blankly like that? When we first saw Wang Lilan's body this morning, didn't you make a correct judgment? You said it looked like a knife wound. Yes, it was a knife wound. The width of the wound is obvious evidence. Also, when the bullet passed through her back, the hole in her back was small, and there wasn't much blood, which also showed that the bullet wasn't fatal. There was no doubt about that. How could you forget?"

I replied, "Yes, I had the impression of a knife wound at a glance, but Ni Jinshou immediately corrected me and said it was a gunshot wound; at the same time, he explained that everyone in the house heard the gunshot, and there was also a bullet that he pried out of the wall, which did pass through Wang Lilan's chest, and it just so happened to pass through the same wound. Therefore, I became confused and didn't dare to insist on my preconceived notions."

Hawthorne nodded and said, "Yes, the complexity of this case lies in this point - in this double murder. In fact, if it were a simple shooting, then the theft of Wang Lilan's jewelry would be unexplainable. It was impossible to rob her beforehand, because she didn't scream. She would never let people take away her beloved jewelry without resistance. It was also impossible to steal it afterward, because time didn't allow it. We already discussed it this morning. So this is obviously a double murder case. Once you think about it, you know that the jewelry must have been stolen at the moment of the assassination, before the shooting. Your opinion obviously has international evidence, it wasn't produced out of thin air, you don't need to doubt yourself."

"So, you also believed that Wang Lilan died from a knife wound long ago."

"Yes - I also assumed that the real murderer might be in that house. However, because of the 'Type A' leather shoe prints, I hesitated a bit and didn't dare to decide for a while."

"Then, why didn't you start with the people in the house more quickly? Instead, you wasted effort circling around outside?"

Hawthorne smiled and said, "What? Circling around? Wasting effort? Bao Lang, how can you say such a thing? Don't you know that the superficial phenomenon of this case, the gun problem, is more important than the stabbing problem? And the person who shot her, although they couldn't really kill Lilan, still had the intention of murder. The person who shot her came from outside, involving many people, and the relationship is very complicated. How could I not deal with the urgent matters first, clear the periphery, and bring out the protagonist of the second murder?"

I was silent for a moment, took two puffs of smoke, and then said, "Since you suspected from the beginning that the person who stabbed the dancing queen to death was someone in the house, did you know that the murderer was that old man Li Zhiban?"

Hawthorne suddenly frowned, slowly exhaled two puffs of smoke, shook his head, and said, "I didn't dare to make a rash judgment. Because the materials I initially obtained were not enough to fully understand what motives he had. Of course, I can't draw conclusions based on ideals alone." (172)

### A Look at Society Gritting Teeth

Gentlemen, ladies:

I dare,

I dare to ask you,

Please come and see the situation of buying cheap rice.

If you are afraid of getting dirty,

Stand a little further away;

If not,

You can also come in a car!

Then I will point out to you:

Over there,

A long, long line, as dilapidated as garbage,

There are:‚Äî‚Äî

Old, female, small‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

Surging, bustling, pushing‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

You say they are "smiling?"

This is a bitter smile, somewhat painful and poignant,

Not knowing why!

Next to it?

That is the gentleman who maintains order;

Holding a whip in his hand,

It's a thick wooden stick!

"Snap!" "Click!"

(Oh, don't clap, please rest assured.)

Because that little child "didn't keep order,"

He was slapped and whipped.

Blood! Ah, covered in it!

(But still don't clap.)

It froze after being blown by the cold wind,

Just a few more welts.

What! Crying?

Don't be so sad!

Or tell the driver to go to the dance hall;

Otherwise, go see a movie‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

Writing is not what I am afraid of, but recently, I have been encouraged by fellow photography enthusiasts, who often come to discuss everything, which seems to have inspired my long-hidden thoughts of hiding my clumsiness. So, regardless of whether it is good or bad, I will write this article to study with my comrades, and I hope readers will give me advice.

The question is often mentioned regarding the skills, so I will first talk about this issue. The skills of photography are discussed from two aspects: one is the use of the camera, and the other is the choice of angle and the adoption of light. If the reader can put in some effort and have a considerable understanding of these two aspects, it will naturally not be difficult to construct a photograph of contemporary art.

The structure of the camera has progressed to a very subtle point. Although we only need to spend a considerable price to get the most sophisticated camera into our hands, if we do not train the camera's aperture and shutter to be as proficient as training our own eyes, opening and closing at will, then we will not be able to use the mysteries of the camera freely.

The shutter and aperture in the camera function like human eyes; to train them to be as proficient as our own eyes in observing objects, we should use the camera's shutter from the fastest to the slowest, and each kind of speed. Use several decisions on the subject being photographed at the same time to make a comparison. With this comparison, you will know the character of the shutter's speed. Then, record and compare from the finest point of the aperture to the largest point, so that you can boldly use its most suitable character to capture the subject under different circumstances. Usually, there is a habit of only using F.11 for distant scenes and F.8 for close-ups. Although the camera is equipped with F.22 and F.4 apertures, most people dare not try them; this is because they do not know the expression of its character. Taking photos with such experience is really a bit of a disappointment for such a sophisticated camera.

Like these days when the sun is weak, outdoor photography only needs to use a larger aperture (below F.8) to take beautiful photos, and it will never be bad; on the contrary, in summer, when the sun is too strong, making people unable to open their eyes, you have to close your upper and lower eyelids tightly, leaving only a slit, to be able to see the distance, you must not stubbornly use F.11 to shoot distant scenes, and F.8 to shoot close-ups: naturally, you also have to let only a little bit of the lens show, boldly using F.22 for distant scenes, and F.16 for close-ups; if the subject or background is white or other colors, and the sunlight reflects back into the eyes, you should use an even smaller aperture. The application of the shutter is to help the aperture collect light. Its use is like the opening and closing of the eyes. Between this opening and closing, the speed must be moderate.

Hu Die is Still Safe and Sound in Hong Kong Hai Xing
Various Rumors are Completely Groundless

(Hong Kong News) An Associated Press dispatch from Shanghai on the 11th said: Film queen Hu Die died of dystocia in Shanghai last night (the 10th). This morning (the 11th) at around ten o'clock, the reporter visited Hu Die and talked with her for a long time. Hu was as healthy as usual, and she also had no childbirth. Hu Die also described her recent situation as follows:

It is true that a certain company asked me to make a movie, and we have discussed it several times. As for which company it is, I have not decided yet, and I do not want to make it public before it is a done deal. The reporter also asked if she was still interested in acting life? Ms. Hu said: I still have the same enthusiasm as when I first entered the film industry and am not tired of it. However, as times progress, movies also progress. The backward phenomenon of early movies is similar to the current situation, but I believe it will not last long, so I will be especially cautious about filming in the future. She also said that it is rumored in Shanghai that she has gone to the Philippines, but in fact, she has not left Hong Kong for a single step, but she did have this opportunity but it did not materialize.

The reporter asked about the Shanghai Xinhua Company's preparation to produce "Yang Guifei" in Shanghai, starring Chen Yunshang, Ms. Hu informed that because she was unwilling to go to Shanghai, Xinhua would have to change people, and said that Chen Yunshang's acting path is very broad, so she is competent.

Hu Die's weight has decreased, and her appearance has not diminished, and she herself still seems to dislike being too fat, and is still trying to diet to achieve an ideal healthy and beautiful physique.

### Adopting a Strong Policy Towards the Far East: U.S. Determined to Prevent Japan's Southern Advance; Roosevelt Earnestly Appeals for Labor Unity; Many Professors Advocate Expanding Aid to China

Washington - Administration officials recently acknowledged that the recent U.S. election is a harbinger of a strong U.S. policy towards the Far East, saying that the U.S. appears poised to resist any new Japanese attempts to advance southward. Official and non-official individuals are closely studying news and reports from China, Vietnam, and Japan. There have been numerous rumors and indications from China, Vietnam, and Japan suggesting that Japan will take military action towards the South. Military authorities generally believe that the Japanese army's withdrawal from Southern China and concentration of troops and supplies on Hainan Island are the prelude to military or diplomatic maneuvers in the South China Sea. Experts say that Japan's primary objective at this time must be Saigon or Borneo. (United Press dispatch, 20th)

New Orleans - President Roosevelt asked the nation's labor force to unite for the sake of national interests, and not to divide into factions. Last night, the President took the opportunity of the resignation of Mr. Lewis, head of the Industrial Organizations Congress, and sent a message to the American Federation of Labor, advocating that the labor movement should seek fair and honorable peace, and emphatically called for a great unified democracy to meet the needs of any events that the country will encounter. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)

Boston - The Dean of Harvard Law School and fifteen Harvard professors recently published an article in the December issue of the "Atlantic Monthly," advocating that the United States take strong steps to deter Japan's expansionist plans in the South Pacific. According to the professors' proposal, the United States should declare a complete ban on commercial exchanges with Japan and expand all possible material assistance to the Chongqing National Government. Furthermore, the U.S. should reach an agreement with the British and Dutch governments so that the U.S. can use naval bases in the South Pacific. The original text stated: "Britain, America, and the Netherlands should jointly use their naval bases in the Far East. If Japan attacks the United States or invades Singapore or the Dutch East Indies, the three countries can impose a complete naval blockade." The article also stated that if the United States cannot take action quickly in the Pacific, the Soviet Union may join Japan in dividing China, and the Near East, which supports Britain's resistance, will also be discouraged. Moreover, Mexico and the South American countries will inevitably see the appeasement policy as the only safe path. Therefore, if the United States allows Japan to use Annam as a base to conquer China and absorb all of Asia's resources, the consequences will be unimaginable. It is noted that the professors who authored this article were led by Landis, the Dean of Harvard Law School. (United Press dispatch, 20th)

Japanese Raw Silk: U.S. Bans Imports

Washington - The U.S. Maritime Commission yesterday ordered nine shipping companies, including six Japanese shipping companies such as Nippon Yusen Kaisha and Mitsui & Co., to immediately stop transporting raw silk into the United States by falsely claiming it to be cotton or other raw materials. The committee pointed out that the shipping companies deliberately turned a blind eye to the true type of goods they were loading, because if they truthfully stated on the manifest that the goods were silk, it would cause losses to the shipping companies' business. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)

Tokyo - Japanese Minister of Commerce and Industry Kobayashi recently stated that due to the European war and the increasingly tense international situation, the economic pressure from the U.S. and Britain on Japan is also intensifying. He also said that the U.S. not only prohibits the export of gasoline and machinery to Japan, but also prohibits the export of scrap iron. Although the U.S. does not change its embargo policy, Japan has guaranteed to have the necessary supplies to maintain its simple living standards and maintain its national strength to cope with war.

### Japan Aims to Avoid War with U.S.: Observations of a Philippine Expert

Washington - Filipino economist Villamin said that Japan might adopt methods to avoid going to war with the U.S. in order to fulfill its obligations to the German-Italian Axis. He also stated that his remarks were purely personal opinions and did not represent the Philippine government. He has served in parliamentary, business, and academic circles, analyzing and commenting on the Far East issues concerning the Philippines. His remarks were briefly as follows: "I believe that as a result of the alliance of Germany, Italy, and Japan, a U.S.-Japan war is probably even less likely than before. Japan's responsibilities to the alliance are: (1) to create obstacles for the United States, preventing it from assisting Britain in the Atlantic, and (2) to disrupt British colonies in the Pacific. The reward that Germany and Italy promised Japan at the time must have been the Dutch East Indies and Vietnam, or a part of these two territories, just like they rewarded the Soviet Union with half of Poland a year ago. However, today's Japan has no excuse to occupy the Dutch East Indies and Vietnam. Germany, on the other hand, can argue that it has conquered France and the Netherlands and therefore has the right to govern the territories of France and the Netherlands. At this time, Japan can fulfill its alliance obligations without having to go to war with the U.S. Japan knows that it gains much more by maintaining peace with the U.S. and loses much more by going to war with the U.S., and knows that if it fights the U.S., it will inevitably suffer resistance from both the manpower of China and the material and military resources of the U.S. Moreover, the cost of the war against China has already been huge, and German-Italian assistance is unlikely. For this reason, it will be difficult for Japan and the U.S. to go to war. Even if war breaks out, the culprit will not be the alliance of the totalitarian powers." (United Press dispatch, 20th)

### Construction of Sino-American Warships: Sudden Fire; Seven Injured, Minor Losses; One Destroyer Also Damaged Due to Carelessness

New York - The 35,000-ton battleship "South Dakota," under construction at the Camden shipyard, and the destroyer "Gwin," under construction at the Boston shipyard, both suddenly caught fire yesterday. The cause of the former's fire was said to be spontaneous combustion, while the latter was caused by the molten metal used by a riveter. Seven people were slightly injured and one person was seriously injured in the "South Dakota" fire. The fire burned for twenty minutes, and the losses were minor, but there was a risk that the other twenty ships being built in the same shipyard would be affected. The fire on the "Gwin" also burned for thirty minutes. This was the second fire in the Boston shipyard in three days. The previous fire was a careless fire in the shipyard warehouse on Saturday. (United Press dispatch, 20th)

### Japan to Continue Negotiations with Dutch East Indies

Tokyo - Today, the Foreign Ministry spokesman replied to a question from a foreign news reporter, saying that the agreement signed by the Mitsui & Co. directors and the representatives of the Batavia oil companies and the negotiations between the Japanese and Dutch East Indies governments are two completely different matters. The agreement does not represent an agreement between the two governments, so we will continue our negotiations with the Dutch East Indies authorities. The spokesperson declined to disclose the contents of the agreement. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)

### Japanese Privy Council Holds Meeting Yesterday; Konoe Denies Tendency Towards Communism to the Council

### Zhang Fakui and Huang Xuchu Plan to Revive Southern Guangxi; Huang to Go to Longzhou to Direct Refugee Relief; Zhang Has Ordered 20,000 Dan of Rice to Be Shipped to Nanning

Nanning - Zhang Fakui, Commander of the Fourth War Zone, and Huang Xuchu, Chairman of Guangxi Province, have planned to revive the Southern Guangxi area. Chairman Huang will soon go to Longzhou to direct refugee relief. General Zhang has ordered 20,000 dan of rice to be shipped to Nanning. Chairman Huang told a United Press reporter that he has requested a central government appropriation of 4 million yuan for relief. In addition, 1 million yuan will be raised in Guangxi Province. One-third of the residents of Nanning have returned to the city, and 20% of the shops have reopened. Schools in Nanning are being prepared for restoration. (United Press dispatch, 20th)

### National Government Relief: Food for the Poor

Chongqing - The National Government's Food Bureau is currently seeking ways to cope with the current high rice prices. It has ordered the National Food Administration to prepare rice and supply it to government employees and the poor at the prescribed price, and will set up offices to provide rice relief to the poorest and most destitute. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)

Chongqing - According to the Deputy Director of the National Agricultural Research Bureau today, the food produced in Sichuan Province is sufficient to supply 51 million residents with a surplus. The current soaring food prices are not due to poor harvests, but are caused by hoarding and speculation. It is found that Sichuan Province produces 140 million shi of rice, 36 million dan of wheat, 28 million dan of barley, and 53 million dan of sweet potatoes each year. The annual consumption is only 130 million shi of rice, 33 million dan of wheat, 29 million dan of barley, and 49 million dan of sweet potatoes. Therefore, Sichuan Province still has a surplus of 15 million dan of grain each year. Sichuan Province had a bumper agricultural harvest last year, so the National Government implemented a grain purchasing program to alleviate the difficulties of farmers and to store military grain, but the remaining rice is still sufficient to feed the people until the end of September next year. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)

### Detailed Measures for Suppressing and Stabilizing Prices in Hunan

Changsha - Since the implementation of the price stabilization movement in Hunan Province, the people have been very happy.

The highest price shall not exceed seven yuan per shi of millet and fifteen yuan per shi of rice. (2) For counties and cities that are not self-sufficient in grain, those that transport grain from other places shall be permitted to add freight charges based on the distance of the grain source, subject to verification and approval by the county price evaluation committee. (3) In addition to grain and rice, for other daily necessities, in order to facilitate the implementation of price stabilization, the market price set in November of the 29th year shall be reduced in stages each month, with a reduction of one-tenth of the market price set in November of the 29th year on the 15th of each month. (4) It is strictly forbidden for people, merchants, and grain owners in each county to hide and not sell, or to hoard and speculate. Violators shall have their goods purchased and sold by the price evaluation committee at 90% of the prescribed price. (5) Work stoppages are absolutely prohibited, and serious offenders will be severely punished. (Dispatch of the 19th)

Hengyang - Hengyang has been trading according to the new prices announced by the government since the 17th. Since the implementation, commodity prices have been falling daily due to the enthusiastic arrival of goods from all parties, and the results have been very good. (Dispatch of the 20th)
