### Wu Jingheng's Report at the Central Memorial Week

Chongqing. At the Central Memorial Week on the morning of the 29th, Chairman Lin presided over the meeting. Committee Member Wu Jingheng reported briefly, saying that in the past few days, our people across the country have heard a very ridiculous joke, which is the so-called (Japan-China Relations Adjustment). The President has already told us that this kind of one-sided love is not worth a penny. After this adjustment was disclosed, the Japanese side argued in newspapers and broadcasts that it was not entirely consistent with the content. They were trying to cover it up, fearing it would hinder current diplomacy. Therefore, the President told friendly countries that his (New Order in East Asia) is just like this, an endless aggression against the world. The President also told his compatriots that the so-called peace is just like this, asking us to (bear humiliation and endure pain) and all surrender ourselves as slaves of a conquered nation. In short, this kind of ridiculously funny one-sided love is customary for the islanders. It is smaller than a chopstick on a clear sky. The Tanaka Memorial, has been disclosed to the world for more than twenty years. According to their good dream, after the successful New Order in East Asia, they will further succeed in the New World Order. So, whatever policy, whatever adjustment, let them talk as they please. We can just laugh at this kind of worthless talk. Last year, some loyal and honest people thought that the followers of Chen might have some special qualities, but who knew they would turn out like this. Everyone should have heard the Japanese broadcast. Before going to the Qingdao Conference, he sent a telegram to Wang Liang, saying that he was deeply grateful. After the Qingdao Conference, he also called Wang Liang a predecessor, thanking them for helping him. Master Zhu said, (If you are afraid of loss, you will do anything. You might kill your father and your ruler, or lick sores and piles). Premier Sun spent forty years striving for China's freedom and equality, but it has been lightly changed to (bear humiliation and endure pain). After this joke came out, everyone said that it was absolutely not worth paying attention to. But everyone felt that our war of resistance should be doubled in effort, and it is worth doubling several times to make the Japanese fail quickly. The President pointed out that the Japanese are sinking deeper and deeper into the quagmire. One newspaper put it most clearly, saying that the Japanese are now intensifying this trick, proving that they feel that they can't raise the gun anymore day by day. They want to use the pen to play a set of hypnosis to get out of this quagmire. Haha, Chinese people are your teachers, are your teachers already senile? Of course, you are standing there dreaming. Speaking of our getting stronger and stronger as we fight, causing him to sink deeper and deeper, it is only the result of the united efforts of the heroic soldiers of the whole country, the patriotic compatriots of the whole country, following the leading Chairman Chiang, and following the many wise men inside and outside the party who are wholeheartedly saving the country. Now we have to double our efforts, and everyone is prepared early. Now I have no other contribution, only willing to say a few words of comfort to those who work hard and redouble their efforts. Effort is Zhuge Wuhou's exhausting efforts. Ordinary people always feel a bit scared when they talk about exhausting their efforts. I hope that there will be no war, so that the exhausting efforts can be reduced. But if we think carefully, we feel that if Zhuge Wuhou came alive, he would definitely tell us, please don't just value my exhausting efforts, don't forget that Sima Yi also exhausted his efforts, and his luck was good, he had capable sons and capable grandsons, all of whom could exhaust their efforts and gain the world. But who mentions their exhausting efforts now? Only my exhausting efforts have won everyone's love and praise for 1,500 years. So, what is the purpose of exhausting efforts? My exhausting efforts are for the revival of the Han Dynasty, so I have won 1,500 years of sympathy. After the Qingdao Conference, Wang Kemin described the process, saying that he did not hesitate to go alone, even if he failed halfway. Is this kind of spirit of exhausting efforts okay? You have worked so hard to exhaust your efforts, and even Qin Hui scolds you thoroughly. If we compare Mencius's words with exhausting efforts, we will know that the hardship of exhausting efforts is unavoidable for the wise, the foolish, the old, and the young. This distinction between should and shouldn't be shows whether it is worth it or not. So I checked Mencius, and he said that when the rooster crows and gets up, he works hard on something. When the rooster crows and gets up, he can still work hard, which is exhausting efforts. Just like Yu Shun, he gets up when the rooster crows and works hard to do good, which is Zhuge Wuhou's exhausting efforts, wanting to revive the Han Dynasty, compared to Zhi Zhi, this is getting up when the rooster crows and working hard for profit, which is the current people's exhausting efforts, wanting to bear humiliation and endure pain. So, the above said that the hardship of exhausting efforts is unavoidable for the wise, the foolish, the old, and the young. I am not borrowing Zhuge Wuhou's mouth to talk nonsense, it is Mencius who said it, and there is a book to prove it. Therefore, everyone wants to stop the war, and can reduce the hardship of exhausting efforts, it is the ordinary ideal. On the good side, if you want people to admit that he is good, you must exhaust your efforts to work, exhaust your efforts to plan the state, exhaust your efforts to teach, and cultivate talents, etc., which cannot be said completely, you must exhaust your efforts to win people to call him good, that is, close the door to thank guests, or travel and play, but also can close the door to exhaust your efforts to write books, or can exhaust your efforts to drag down ancient monuments, collect specimens, at least to exhaust your efforts to write poetry, to exhaust your efforts to create five words to break a few whiskers, so that people allow him to be close to good, on the side of profit, if you can really get profit, you must also exhaust your efforts to sharpen your head will drill, this and so on, also varied, countless, this dare not say more, pollute everyone's ears, but to explain that no wise no foolish no old no young, everyone can not avoid the hardship of exhausting efforts, Mencius stopped saying two extremes, is not enough to explain, since there are two extremes, naturally there is a middle, we should help Mencius to say this middle, can add a sentence said, the rooster crows and gets up, hit 孳 　話者, the drunken life and death of the people, we once out of the womb, immediately exhaust our efforts, at first to eat milk, exhaust our efforts to cry, a little bigger, exhaust our efforts to play mud, exhaust our efforts to fight with the children of the neighbors, exhaust our efforts to explain this, let us transform the unintentional exhaust our efforts, to do that meaningful exhaust our efforts, how can we be proud of the small reference, let us not be able to last doubled efforts, doubled exhaust our efforts, can help us to reason early to complete China's freedom and equality, then both predecessors will be afraid of future generations, in Zhuge Wuhou exhaust our efforts, for exhaust our efforts to open a new record, exhaust our efforts to resist the war, the longer the better, I admire this kind of exhaust our efforts, contribute this little meaning, and for everyone to report a very comforting pleasure, (29th dispatch)

### Japan Indicates No Concessions to the United States

Tianjin. Lieutenant General Honma, commander of the Japanese Garrison Army in Tianjin, spoke here to guests about the possible connection between the abolition of the U.S.-Japan trade agreement and the sudden tightening of restrictions on imports and exports in Tianjin, issuing a warning that the United States must improve U.S.-Japan relations. He said that if our efforts to improve relations with the United States all fail, the Japanese see no reason to give special treatment to the American people anymore. The Japanese army will be forced to re-examine the situation and consider what steps to take. No matter how much pressure is applied, Japan will never abandon the establishment of the New Order in East Asia. Just think about how much Japan has sacrificed in this incident. If you were in our place, would you be willing to cancel its already established work because of the oppression of other countries? (29th Reuters Dispatch)

Editorial

### German-Romanian Economic Negotiations

History, of course, cannot be replayed, but similar events happening in the past and present are often seen. Take Romania as an example. The difficulties she faces now are clearly similar to those she encountered during the last World War. In the last World War, Romania stood on the side of the Allied Powers. Although there were many allied countries, as a small country in the southeast of Germany, Austria, and Bulgaria, it was standing alone. Initially, Imperial Russia echoed its position, but when Imperial Russia was defeated and a revolution occurred within the country, with the majority party in power, Germany and Russia signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in 1917. At that time, although Romania continued to fight, the enemy cavalry penetrated deep into its territory, and a large part of its territory was lost. In March 1918, it had to follow in Russia's footsteps and conclude the Treaty of Bucharest with the Allied Powers. It ceded Dobruja to Bulgaria and abandoned its oil-producing areas and the mountain passes of the Carpathians. The richest areas for oil and rice production were almost completely lost. If the Allied Powers had not won the final victory later, Romania's national destiny would have been cut short.

Due to the final victory of the Allied Powers, Romania not only preserved its original territory, but also benefited from the Treaty of 1919, acquiring Transylvania from Hungary and Bessarabia from Russia. Its territory jumped from 53,489 square miles before the war to 122,282 square miles. Its population increased from 3,989,606 before the war to the current 20 million. Since then, the country's power has been increasing, and it has become a major power in Eastern Europe, with Bucharest becoming the center of political and diplomatic importance in Eastern Europe. In the eyes of Britain and France, it was seen as an important stronghold for maintaining the balance of power in Europe and a bulwark against Germany. For Romania itself, it formed an alliance with Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and other countries. Poland was its right arm, Czechoslovakia was its vanguard, and Yugoslavia supported it from behind. Looking at the past twenty years after the war, Romania's geographical advantage and harmony among its people were unique. It can truly be said to be a country that was well-positioned in all aspects, had nothing to fear, and enjoyed a peaceful and prosperous golden age.

However, good times don't last forever, and turmoil is unpredictable. Since the rise of aggression in the Far East and the trampling of the international order by violence, a bad precedent has been set, and disaster has spread to Europe, leading to the current state of turmoil. Romania can no longer rest easy. The times have changed, and the lips are gone, the teeth are cold. First, the fall of Czechoslovakia completely removed the barrier, and then Poland became a meat on the chopping board, making the situation indeed precarious. The predators with saliva dripping and eyes full of covetousness, are now surrounding Romania: Soviet Russia, Germany, Bulgaria, both new and old grudges, each with its own desires to achieve satisfaction. Moreover, it is not only the international environment that is like this. The complexity of the domestic ethnic groups also has the potential for internal strife. If the Turkish, Greek, Yugoslav, Czech, Polish, and other minority ethnic groups live in Romania, it will not cause much problem. In addition, in Transylvania there are Germans, and in the western region there are Magyars (Hungarians). These two ethnic groups are not only large in number, but also have long been led by their own countrymen, waiting for the right moment to act. Others, such as the Russians in Bessarabia and the Bulgarians in Dobruja, all have their own allegiances, and their loyalty is not necessarily strong, while the possibility of dissension is greater. As long as war breaks out, it is difficult to withstand behind-the-scenes maneuvers, and it is inevitable that they will surge under the call of national self-determination or any other slogan, following the coercion of external forces. Currently, Germany only has suggestions for improving economic relations between the two countries with Romania, and not any military action. But one must know that if these economic demands are fully committed to, it will be tantamount to making Romania an economic appendage of Germany.

German-Romanian economic negotiations started as early as March last year. At that time, the conditions proposed by Germany were: (1) Romania should gradually abandon its industrial construction plan and gradually close its existing factories, and from then on specialize in developing agriculture. (2) Various products, such as grain, oil, timber, and livestock, can only be sold to Germany. If the above two points are followed, then Germany is prepared to guarantee Romania's territorial integrity and national independence. Later, because Romania had the support of Britain behind it, Germany failed to achieve its wishes. However, due to the signing of the German-Romanian trade agreement, the following were finally realized: (1) Germany will help Romania gradually revitalize various industries, such as agriculture, forestry, mining, oil industry, etc., within a few years, and Germany will purchase various products in large quantities from them. (2) Germany and Romania jointly invest in setting up an oil company to develop Romania's oil resources. (3) Germany will supply Romania with machinery and armaments for use in improving its industry and military equipment. (4) Expand communications and promote transportation. These conditions can certainly be interpreted as friendly cooperation, economic cooperation, a mere way to co-exist and prosper, which absolutely does not hinder Romania's territorial sovereignty, is vastly different from the so-called aggression. But explanations are just explanations, and how can the results be concealed? Romania's economic lifeline will be entirely in the hands of the Germans. The remaining question is a technical question, but it is also a factual question: how can Germany get these resources into its hands for its own needs? By the time the Second World War occurred, Germany's military needs and food supplies were even more dependent on Eastern European countries, and its pressure on Romania was naturally even more intensified. The current negotiations to improve German-Romanian economic relations are based on this reason. According to news from foreign dispatches, the theme of these German-Romanian negotiations is: first, how to speed up the transportation of Romanian oil to Germany via railway; second, to formulate a German-Romanian currency ratio. The former is to make Romania supply Germany with a large amount of raw materials for war, while the latter requires Romania to fundamentally devalue its currency, so that Germany can reduce the cost of war. If Germany's conditions for Romania are realized, it will be very helpful for supporting a long-term war, and the effectiveness of the British and French blockade policy will be greatly weakened. This is what Britain and France oppose and what the current Romanian authorities are hesitant about. Romania, in the past, was France's main satellite in Eastern Europe, and the current Prime Minister Tatărescu is also known for being pro-French. At the same time, in the past year, Britain and France have also exhausted their diplomatic efforts to win over Romania. Therefore, although Romania has accepted Germany's offensive economically, Romania is still in line with Britain and France politically. However, due to the far-reaching impact, Germany will never let Romania go easily. And Romania is in the midst of being surrounded on all sides. Although Britain and France are friendly, they are far away and cannot put out the fire immediately. Diplomacy has repeatedly declared the safety of Romania to be secured, but in fact it has failed to alleviate the crisis in Romania. Poland's rapid defeat by Germany is precisely what Romania regards as a lesson from the past. Recently, there have been frequent reports of German troops entering Soviet-occupied Poland. Regardless of the true meaning, this momentum is enough to make Romania tremble. I still remember two years ago. The second leader of the German Nazi Party, Goering, openly said to the Romanians in Breslau: "Once we solve the Czechs, it will be your turn." The current economic negotiations fully demonstrate Germany's determination to "turn"!

### Report of US Government's Proposal: Continued Financial Aid to China, Temporary Halt to Legislation Banning Exports to Japan, Embargo Bill to Begin Debate Tomorrow

Washington: According to current reports, efforts to replace a legislative ban on exports to Japan with continued financial aid to China are making some progress in the Senate. It is rumored that Secretary of State Hull has informally stated to Senate leaders that the State Department prefers not to implement a ban at this time, as he does not favor escalating the current situation after the expiration of the US-Japan Commercial Treaty. The termination of the treaty implies that Japan, if it wishes to continue trade, must respect US interests. (Reuters, 29th)

Washington: Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman announced last night, "The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will begin considering a bill to ban the export of military supplies and raw materials to Japan on Wednesday. Secretary of State Hull may attend the meeting to report on the evolution of US-Japan relations after the expiration of the 1911 US-Japan Commercial Treaty. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will take cautious action when considering the embargo bill against Japan. The current situation between Japan and the United States is not serious, and there is no need to take rash action. Therefore, Congress advocates a gradual approach, and we must also observe the development of relations between the two countries after the expiration of the treaty. Before implementing an embargo, we must understand how our people are currently being treated. Congress may soon grant the President the power to impose an embargo, but it is also possible that the President may never use that power. However, Japan currently seems to be using the closure of the Chinese market as a means of dealing with our country, and as far as I know, the Japanese are currently discriminating against us in five or six ways, so we must observe whether the Japanese continue to discriminate against us." Pittman dismissed the threats of Japanese retaliation, saying, "I am accustomed to more aggressive statements made by Japanese military leaders in the past, but so far nothing has happened." (Associated Press, 29th)

### US Newspaper Advocates: Convene International Conference to Resolve Sino-Japanese Issue; Impose Sanctions if Japan Does Not Comply

Washington: The New York Daily News editorial today stated that if Japan refuses to resolve the China issue through an international conference, the United States will definitely implement an export embargo to pressure Japan. According to the newspaper, the US and Japan have now entered a treaty-less situation, "In this situation, regarding the vast market of China, we should suggest to Japan to convene a four- or five-power international conference to seek a fair resolution. What reason could Japan have for not forming an agreement with the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, together with the government led by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, to establish an open door policy and equal opportunities? What we should do is seek the cessation of the war in China, to allow Japan to save face, and to allow China to develop gradually and in an orderly manner. We believe that it would be good if Secretary of State Hull could work in this direction. If Japan rejects our suggestion, then we can gradually tighten the screws." (Associated Press, 29th)

### Japanese Public Opinion Reveals War-Weariness; Asahi Shimbun Discusses Current Situation, Criticizing the Foreign Ministry's Lack of Foresight

Tokyo: According to today's commentary in the Asahi Shimbun, the "Asama Maru" incident and the China Incident both occurred due to the Foreign Ministry's lack of foresight. "The dismissal of Captain Watanabe of the Asama Maru and the general dissatisfaction with Watanabe are extremely inappropriate. The occurrence of this incident should be attributed to the Foreign Ministry's lack of foresight, as it failed to take steps to avoid the occurrence of this incident in advance. As for the occurrence of the China Incident, it was also due to the Foreign Ministry's lack of foresight. If the Japanese Foreign Ministry had foresight, it would have been able to foresee that in the vast territory of China, there are many rivers and countless machine gun fortresses.

Because the Philippine ship sank half an hour later, all the remaining passengers and crew members were rescued. After a roll call, it was discovered that two people were still missing, so a search was immediately started, but only one was found. The other person was never found. When the 112 passengers and crew members of the Philippine ship landed here, they were all wearing clothes given by the captain and crew of the Japanese ship. After consultation between the Japanese ship and the Kobe Maritime Police, the survivors were accommodated in the Seamen's Hostel, the Asian Rotary Hall, the Kobe Hotel, and the Yamamoto Hotel, etc., awaiting the arrival of the President Cleveland, scheduled to sail for Manila on Tuesday.

Tokyo: Regarding the news carried by the "Asahi Shimbun" today, stating that Italian Foreign Minister Ciano recently suggested forming a new anti-communist group during talks with Japanese Ambassador to Italy, Eiji Amau, the Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman denied this this afternoon, stating that Tokyo officials are unaware of this suggestion and that Japan considers the Anti-Comintern Pact to be extremely sound, and Japan will continue to support it under any circumstances. (Haitong News Agency, 29th)

London: Japanese ambassadors and consuls in several European countries are holding a meeting in the capital of Hungary. The London Daily Mail's famous reporter, Price, is currently there observing the progress of the meeting. He reports that the goal of the meeting is to find a way to "patch up" the Anti-Comintern Pact. It is also rumored that a suggestion is being considered to advise the Japanese government that if the Soviet Union uses force or threats to expand its influence into the Balkan Peninsula, Japan should provide Italy and Hungary with assistance. (Havas News Agency, 29th)

Tokyo: At today's Foreign Ministry press briefing, a foreign reporter asked about the special dispatch from the Hungarian capital carried by the Asahi Shimbun, stating that Italian Foreign Minister Ciano suggested to Japanese Ambassador to Italy, Amau, before he departed for the Hungarian capital, that if Japan feels dissatisfied with the existing Anti-Comintern Pact due to the German-Soviet friendship, perhaps a new pact could be revised. The Foreign Ministry spokesman replied that there was no official news about this matter, but that in our minds, there is no new anti-communist pact, and none of the Japanese ambassadors to Europe have this intention. The spokesman also pointed out the existence of the Tripartite Anti-Comintern Pact and Germany's continued participation, and said that due to historical, royal, and national political institutions and other relationships, the anti-communism in the minds of the Japanese people is quite strong. The spokesman continued, saying that the so-called Hungarian capital meeting, or the meeting of Japanese diplomatic representatives in Southeast Europe, is merely a routine matter because the Japanese delegates have been granted permission by their government to make inspection tours and happened to gather in the Hungarian capital to exchange views on the European situation. (Reuters, 29th)

Budapest: The meeting of Japanese envoys in Europe, which has been held here in recent days, concluded last night after a final session that lasted eight hours.

### Germany Uses Threats and Enticements to Coax Balkan Countries; Warns Southern Countries to Avoid Joining Blocs; Assures Romania That the Soviet Union Will Not Invade; Conditioned on Continuous Oil Shipments to Germany

Capital of Yugoslavia: According to today's report in the local newspaper, the German Foreign Ministry has issued a warning to Yugoslavia, advising it to avoid joining any form of Balkan bloc, because Turkey, which Germany is extremely dissatisfied with and distrustful of, is participating in this Balkan conference. (Associated Press, 29th)

Rome: According to authoritative sources here today, Germany has assured Romania that as long as Romanian oil continues to be imported into Germany, Romania need not worry about the Soviet Union seizing Bessarabia. (Associated Press, 29th)

### Balkan Conference to Open Soon; Will Certainly Contribute to Peace; Relations Between Countries Are Exceptionally Complex; Neutral Bloc Plan May Not Be Realized

Capital of Yugoslavia: The Yugoslav government's official newspaper, "Vreme," published an editorial yesterday, stating that the Balkan Consultative Conference will undoubtedly demonstrate the united solidarity of the Balkan countries and that the interests of all countries in the Danube region and the Balkan Peninsula are the same. Even non-member states of the Balkan Consultative Conference are closely related to the fate of the Balkan countries, sharing weal and woe. Therefore, it is believed that this Balkan conference will make an important contribution to maintaining peace and neutrality in Southeastern Europe. (Haitong News Agency, 29th)

Capital of Yugoslavia: The Permanent Political Council of the Balkan Entente countries will meet here on the 2nd of next month. Observers have recently analyzed Yugoslavia's position, stating that in Yugoslavia's view, the ideal way to maintain neutrality in the Balkan Peninsula is to jointly form a "neutral bloc," including both Hungary and Bulgaria. In addition to mutual guarantees among the participating countries, military assistance should be provided in the event of foreign aggression. However, in reality, organizing such a bloc at this time is not only impossible but also extremely dangerous, because both Hungary and Bulgaria have territorial claims against Romania and Yugoslavia. Even if the bloc cannot be realized, Romania, Greece, and Turkey maintain close relations with Britain and France. If they participate in a neutral bloc, Germany and the Soviet Union will definitely consider this bloc to be organized against them, thus there is a possibility of triggering some kind of danger. Under these circumstances, the Yugoslav government believes that this permanent political conference has no choice but to seek a compromise. In other words, the first goal is to eliminate various obstacles and promote relations between the Balkan countries, and the second goal is to promote a joint declaration by the participating countries on strict adherence to neutrality in the current European war. In addition, the Yugoslav authorities can also recognize the different position of Turkey, knowing that the country not only has interests in the Balkan Peninsula but also has interests in the Mediterranean direction. Therefore, it is expected that it will abide by the mutual assistance pact it has signed with Britain and France, and it is not necessary for the other countries in the Balkan Peninsula to take Turkey as an example. (Havas News Agency, 28th)

Bulgarian Capital: The Balkan Entente countries will meet in the capital of Yugoslavia. According to political figures, the Bulgarian government will not send official observers to attend, but because Turkey has become closer to Bulgaria, the Turkish representative may voice support for Bulgaria's position at the meeting. Therefore, the talks between Turkish Foreign Minister Sarajoglu and Bulgarian Prime Minister Gusayvanov when he departed from Geneva are of great importance. As for the meeting itself, it may not have any special results, but the current policies of the Balkan Entente countries may be clarified as a result. (Havas News Agency, 28th)

Sofia: It is claimed here that although Bulgaria will not send official representatives to the meeting, it will pay close attention to all discussions. The Bulgarian envoy to Yugoslavia will be in contact with the representatives at all times, reporting to Sofia. It is said that Bulgaria's relations with its neighboring countries are exceptionally harmonious. There is a friendship pact with Yugoslavia, and relations between Bulgaria and Turkey have also greatly improved since the Turkish troops withdrew from Bulgarian territory. Regarding relations with Romania, Bulgarian Prime Minister Gusayvanov recently issued a statement, indicating that Bulgaria will never take advantage of others' difficulties and take certain actions against Romania. (Haitong News Agency, 29th)

### Turkish Foreign Minister Issues Statement

Sofia: It was announced here yesterday that Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoglu is scheduled to come to Sofia before the Balkan Conference opens, to have ample time to discuss everything with Bulgarian Prime Minister Gusayvanov. (Haitong News Agency, 29th)

Istanbul: Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoglu issued a statement to reporters today, explaining the upcoming Balkan Entente meeting in the capital of Yugoslavia. Saracoglu declared, "This meeting will discuss the relationship between the Balkan countries and the major powers and their development, but the agenda of the meeting has not yet been announced, so I cannot inform you of anything. Regarding the invitation of Bulgaria and Hungary to send observers to attend the meeting, I have not heard of it. I do not believe that the Balkan Conference has made this invitation to Bulgaria and Hungary. " Referring to the relationship between Turkey and Bulgaria, Saracoglu stated that there has been satisfactory progress. The talks between Turkish Foreign Ministry Secretary General Sioglu and Bulgarian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Gusayvanov in Sofia were extremely satisfactory. The Turkish Prime Minister has exchanged telegrams with the Bulgarian King, which is a symbol of the smooth development of relations between the two countries. When asked by reporters whether the European war would expand to the Balkans, the Turkish Foreign Minister replied, "As far as we are concerned, we are quite confident. We will continue to maintain good relations with all our neighbors, great powers, and small countries." (Haitong News Agency, 29th)

### Soviet Union Denies: Not a Single German Soldier in the Soviet-Occupied Areas of Poland

Moscow: The French Havas News Agency, known as an expert in fabricating and slandering the Soviet Union, has recently concocted a new rumor aimed at slandering the Soviet Union. Havas claimed in a humiliating tone that in "Eastern Galicia" (i.e., Western Soviet Ukraine), in addition to Soviet troops, there were also German troops "managing the railways," and that the German forces there ranged from 500 to 25 divisions. It is obvious that this arbitrary and insulting news is fabricated, but TASS, authorized by responsible parties, believes that it is necessary to deny this report. At the same time, it also stated that there are no foreign soldiers or officials in Western Ukraine, and given the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Germany, there is no need for either side to station troops in each other's territories. (TASS, 29th)

Capital of Switzerland: The "National Daily" recently carried a report from a correspondent stationed in the Romanian capital stating that regarding the rumor that German troops had entered the Soviet-occupied area of eastern Galicia Province in Poland, although the German High Command and semi-official Soviet circles had successively denied it, reliable sources confirmed that it was true. It was learned that German troops had entered the area two weeks ago, and the personnel can be divided into three categories: (1) A group of political police chiefs, who went to various places in Galicia Province to supervise the return of Germans to their country; (2) Several units of regular troops, whose mission was to occupy the railway from the Romanian border to Germany, but the railway was not the main line passing through Lviv, but the secondary railway line passing through the cities of Stanislav, Trokhovy; (3) Several mechanized units, concentrated in the cities of Lviv, Przemysl, and Stanislav in Galicia Province, and carrying many tanks. Although its objectives are unknown, some observers say that the situation in the Soviet-occupied area has recently been quite chaotic, and these German troops are probably responsible for clearing the area. Some other observers believe that the Soviet Union probably wants to transfer its troops stationed there to the Finnish front to help fight, and therefore needs German troops to enter to fill the defense. (Havas News Agency, 29th)

### German Trade Expert Visits Italy: Mission Is to Borrow Railway Cars

Rome: It is rumored here that one of the purposes of Dr. Claudius, a German trade expert, in coming to Italy this time is to obtain Italian railway cars, as the chaos and disrepair of German railways and cars have long been heard here. However, it is generally believed that it is questionable whether Italian railways will cede their cars at a time when the entire country is working hard on national defense preparations. According to the opinions of experts, 65 percent of Italian railways have been electrified, and it may be possible to cede some steam locomotives. (Reuters, 29th)

### Rumor That Britain and France Are Persuading Turkey to Adopt a More Active Anti-Soviet Policy; Activities of British and French Generals Worth Noting

Ankara: General Weygand, commander-in-chief of the French forces in Syria, General Sizer of the British army, and several senior Turkish military officers left here today for Erzurum. It is rumored that Britain and France are demanding that Turkey adopt a more active anti-Soviet policy. The visit of these generals has attracted attention from all sides. It is rumored that the touring group will depart from Erzurum, travel through Anatolia, and go to the Syrian border. General Sizer originally came to Turkey to distribute gifts from Britain to the earthquake victims in Turkey. Whether he has other intentions remains to be seen. (Haitong News Agency, 29th)

### The Asama Maru Case: Japan Decides to Protest to Britain Again, Demanding the Extradition of Detained Germans. Japanese Foreign Ministry Reviews British Response.

Tokyo – Regarding the British government’s response to the Asama Maru incident, the Foreign Ministry authorities, after careful review, listed the following points, pointing out the unreasonableness of the British response: (1) The Japanese government’s interpretation of international law regarding this incident differs in opinion from the British government; (2) The Japanese government’s aforementioned view is fixed and will not be swayed by specific facts such as “the search operation was carried out by the British naval authorities, and the detainees were Germans” (the British side seems to have a significant misunderstanding regarding this point); (3) If both the port of departure and the port of arrival of the Asama Maru were enemy territory, then it would be a different matter, but now the Asama Maru is a neutral ship, and it is sailing from a neutral country to a neutral country, yet the British authorities rashly searched it, which is an unprecedented act under international law; (4) The British Navy’s search procedure was extremely illegal. Therefore, the Foreign Ministry has decided to lodge a serious protest. Foreign Minister Arita has already ordered the relevant departments to quickly draft a rebuttal. Once the draft is completed, Foreign Minister Arita will likely invite British Ambassador Craigie on the 30th to lodge another protest and formally demand the British side hand over the detained Germans based on the reserved rights. (29th Associated Press)

Tokyo – A Foreign Ministry spokesperson stated at a press briefing today that Japan “may” lodge a new protest within a few days, demanding the extradition of the 21 Germans taken from the Asama Maru to Hong Kong by the British Navy. The spokesperson detailed Japan’s view on the matter, namely that Japan insists this is illegal. He continued, stating that the Asama Maru was sailing between the neutral ports of San Francisco and Yokohama, and that this British action harms Japan’s prestige. A reporter then asked, “According to Japan’s view, is it not prohibited for men of military age to travel from the United States to Japan, but is it prohibited to transport trucks and gasoline from the United States to French Indochina? It seems unreasonable that Japan has repeatedly protested to the French ambassador.” The spokesperson evaded the question. (29th Reuters)

London – Regarding the British government’s reply to Japan concerning the “Asama Maru” case of the Japanese shipping company, it is reported that it may not be made public in the next few days. Currently, Sir Robert Craigie, the British Ambassador to Japan, is continuing negotiations with Japanese Foreign Minister Arita on this matter. (29th Havas)

### Soviet Army Launches Winter General Offensive on the Olonets Front, Bombarding Finnish Positions with Artillery and Aircraft

Finland, Capital City – According to news from the front, Soviet troops have begun a winter general offensive in the Lake Ladoga area. The news reports that Lake Ladoga is now completely frozen. Soviet artillery fire is intense in the Karelian Isthmus, bombarding Finnish positions. At the same time, aircraft are assisting in the air. It is also reported that the Soviet Union has dispatched several additional divisions of troops to reinforce Lomoila and Kitela, attempting to attack the Mannerheim Line. (29th Reuter)

Finland, Capital City – A communiqué issued here last night stated that there were no new battles to report on the Karelian Isthmus. Soviet advances northeast of Lake Ladoga were weaker than in previous days, with hundreds of Soviet soldiers killed. Two hundred horses and three tanks within the Soviet supply corps have been destroyed. Patrol activity has been reported on other lines. Soviet aircraft raided northern Finland, dropping about 100 bombs, with only one person reported injured so far. Three Soviet aircraft were shot down. (29th Reuters)

Finland, Capital City – The city issued two consecutive air raid alerts this morning, and anti-aircraft batteries fired on enemy aircraft. (29th Havas)

Sweden, Capital City – A Havas reporter in the Finnish war zone recently telegraphed that Finnish troops, by making full use of their mobile units such as ski troops, can defend their original positions as long as the snow does not melt, and may even be able to repel the Red Army. However, once the snow melts, the natural obstacles encountered by the Red Army will inevitably be reduced. On the other hand, the lakes and rivers are currently frozen, which is the only favorable factor for the Red Army, as it makes attacks easier and the ice surface, in contrast to the surrounding forests, provides a very clear line of sight. This is why the Red Army was able to seize strongholds along the Taipale River. According to military experts, while the advantages enjoyed by Finnish troops will be lost after the snow melts, the numerous lakes throughout the country will still pose a major obstacle to the Red Army’s advance. In the Karelian Isthmus, the Finnish troops currently hold a line of 100 kilometers, which is because all the lakes along the line are frozen. However, after the thaw, the front line can be shortened by half. For example, the combined surface area of Lake Suando and Lake Vuoksi, as well as the marshes in between, is 40 kilometers wide, which is sufficient to serve as a natural barrier for Finnish troops. In addition, west of the Mannerheim Line is Lake Muolaanjärvi, which is six kilometers wide. Other lakes, although smaller in area, are scattered like stars, which is also the case in eastern and northeastern Finland. The Red Army will inevitably encounter difficulties in advancing. As for the thaw, because this winter has been unusually cold, it will be later than in previous years. The thaw is likely to begin in southern Finland in mid-April, and later in the north than in the south. For this reason, Finnish troops will be able to take advantage of the weather for a considerable period of time, and even at the beginning of the thaw, the roads will be muddy and all activities will be stagnant, making it difficult for Soviet motorized units to move, and its entire strategy will have to be temporarily changed. This is also one of the Red Army’s difficulties. In short, no matter what, Finnish troops will continue to resist, and the promises of assistance to Finland from its neighboring countries and the democratic countries of Western Europe can also be seen in action.

### Germany Still Plans to Intensify Submarine Warfare, Ships of Various Countries Continue to Be Lost, Several Incidents Yesterday

Paris – According to news from here today, Germany is now planning to intensify submarine warfare with the remaining half of its submarines. Also, the trenches and ground on the front lines have turned into muddy sludge due to the drizzling rain, making it difficult for aircraft to take off and land, and tanks and heavy artillery are unable to move.

### Japanese Sake is as Weak as Water, Can Raise Goldfish, Brewing Quantity Restricted, Wine Merchants Dilute with Water

Tokyo – The government previously announced on December 1st of last year that the amount of sake brewed in 1940 should be reduced by 48% compared to last year. Since then, the quality of Japanese sake has deteriorated compared to before. Brewers, retailers, and hotels are all diluting it with water. Some even add inferior medicinal materials to prevent spoilage. Comedians say that after Japanese sake has been “baptized” repeatedly, it is as weak as water, and even used to store and raise fish. Fish can survive safely in the sake. In addition, the Ministry of Education is reportedly considering adopting the proposal of the National Spiritual Mobilization Movement to prohibit university and middle school students from drinking alcohol. As for beer, although its export is encouraged, the government has ordered a 20% reduction in the amount consumed by the people, of which a portion must be sent to countries in the yen bloc and supplied to the army and navy. Therefore, the amount enjoyed by the people must actually be reduced by 30%. (28th Havas)

### Severe Cold in Britain, Transportation Stalled, Trains Either Stopped or Delayed, Travelers Suffer

### British and French Parliamentarians Organize Joint Committee to Communicate Opinions and Build Greater Understanding, Subcommittees Established to Handle Three Issues

London – After a delegation of twelve French parliamentarians, led by the country’s Minister of Education, Yvon Delbos, arrived here, a joint committee of British and French parliamentarians was immediately organized and has been established. Delbos also gave a broadcast speech tonight, praising the thoroughness of the ways in which Britain and France are cooperating. Political figures here believe that the committee’s mission is to inform each other of the views of the British and French parliaments at any time, and to inform the parliaments of the British Dominions. Some minor misunderstandings that are unavoidable between the two countries can be eliminated as a result. In short, the purpose of the committee is purely to communicate the opinions of parliamentarians in the two countries so as to build greater understanding between them. For example, issues such as war objectives, the division of labor, the extent to which the British Army participates in land warfare, and the relationship between the two sides and third countries, especially the relationship with the Soviet Union, will all need to rely on this joint committee to exchange views in the future. (28th Havas)

London – The Joint Committee of British and French Parliamentarians held its first meeting today, chaired by the chief French representative, namely the country’s Minister of Education, Yvon Delbos.

### New Party to Emerge in South Africa, Aiming to Achieve a Republic

Cape Town – Members of Parliament under the guidance of former Prime Minister General Hertzog, now the leader of the opposition party, and former Minister of Interior Dr. Malan, the leader of the National Party, have now formed an agreement of mutual cooperation, which will be submitted to the party congress for approval. A statement issued last night declared that the two parties are convinced that the political system most suited to the habits and desires of the South African people is none other than a republic independent of Britain. This is the only effective guarantee that South Africa will no longer be drawn into British wars. The newly formed party is named the “United National Party” or “National Party.” Its aim is to eliminate obstacles to achieve this goal. To create a republic, it is necessary to respect the wishes of the people and the equal rights of both white people in terms of language and culture. This can only be achieved through a special and effective mandate from the electorate, and not merely as a result of a parliamentary majority. All national-minded Afrikaners who are prepared to abide by the obligations of the party, but who do not feel the need to create a republic in the current environment, may also join the party as members. The stated objectives of the communiqué are almost identical to those of the National Party led by Dr. Malan, namely that South Africa should be completely independent politically and economically, with the ultimate goal of establishing a republic.

### The Battle of Kunlun Pass - Record of Interrogation of Japanese Prisoners - Elite Japanese Soldiers Returned from Manchuria and Re-deployed to Guangxi - Detailed Confessions of Japanese Army's Invasion of Guangxi

Bin Yang Correspondence: The Japanese army used its most elite forces in this invasion of Guangxi. The famous "Fifth Division" is the core unit of the Japanese army and also a historical executioner. During the Boxer Rebellion, the Japanese army used this division to attack Tianjin and Beiping. In the Russo-Japanese War, it also galloped across the northeast plains. After the "September 18th Incident," it staged several "bloody battles" there. When Itagaki was the division commander, it was "immensely powerful." After suffering losses in the Battle of Southern Shandong, it rested and reorganized briefly before participating in the Nomonhan Incident on the Mongolian-Manchurian border. This time, it was used to occupy Nanning. Judging from the importance of its mission, it can be seen that this unit is elite and highly valued. Further reinforcements include the 28th Division, which is also an extremely strong unit. The commander of the Fifth Division is now Imamura. After arriving in southern Guangxi, he stationed part of his force in the suburbs of Nanning and sent another part to harass the Yongbin Road. Their vanguard had reached Beima Cenxu and Gaotianxu north of Kunlun Pass and built solid fortifications around it. The Chinese army also used a part of the □□□ unit to undertake the attacking mission. The Chinese army, with the spirit of divine soldiers, attacked Kunlun Pass three times. In three days, the Japanese army concentrated all its efforts to fight back and forth four times, but all were defeated. When clearing the battlefield, more than a hundred unremoved Japanese corpses were found in the fortifications. In another cave, there were many wounded, barely breathing, who were all captured by the Chinese army and taken to a certain command post for preliminary interrogation before being transferred to the □ headquarters for interrogation.

After this prisoner arrived at the □ headquarters, he was temporarily lodged in a civilian house. He was very depressed. His arms, feet, abdomen, and waist were all seriously injured. The Chinese army has always treated prisoners well. The □ military commander, based on this principle, sent a medical officer to treat him. He was a typical Japanese man, short in stature, with a round face covered in dust. His eyes were weak, but sometimes they showed cunning glimmers and a bitter smile.

At this moment, a rich dinner was brought in for him. He greedily devoured it with his hands, finishing four large plates. This was an extraordinary amount of food. Later, he said that he had not eaten for four days.

Upon hearing of Daqianmen cigarettes and a cup of black tea specially prepared for him, placed there for him to enjoy, the interrogation began. First, he was asked about his background. His name was Konishi Katsuyuki, 23 years old, from Shimane Prefecture, Japan. He graduated from the sixth grade of elementary school. He worked in agriculture and lived in the countryside. He had a father, mother, wife, one older brother, four younger brothers, and three older sisters. When talking about his family, he seemed reluctant to speak.

Then, he was asked about his experiences participating in the invasion war in China.

He said, "I was drafted into the army in the fifth conscription and assigned to the Fifth Division to fight in China. Last year, I participated in a battle in Linyi, Shandong. This year, due to the conflict between Japan and the Soviet Union, I was transferred to the Mongolian-Manchurian border to fight. After the war ended, I was ordered to return home. After arriving in Bin Island by ship, I waited at the dock for many days for the cargo to be unloaded. Originally, I could have landed and returned to my hometown, but unexpectedly, I was transferred to China. I was already close to my home, but I couldn't go back and take a look. It's really..." Speaking of this, tears involuntarily welled up in his eyes, showing extreme sadness. After a pause, he continued, "Later, I arrived in southern China after many transfers. On November 14th, I arrived in Beihai and began the 'suppression' of Nanning. Division Commander Imamura gave a speech, saying, 'In the suppression of Nanning, we vow not to return alive.' After landing near Beihai, we marched on foot towards Nanning. We suffered greatly on the road, with no fixed time for eating and sleeping. On the 19th, we began to come into contact with the Chinese army. Unexpectedly, we encountered strong resistance, which made our progress very difficult. It was stipulated that after the entire division conquered Nanning, part of it would remain stationed there, and the majority would be transferred to Guangzhou to fight. Unexpectedly, the Chinese army launched a fierce southward attack, so the plan was changed, and we continued to advance northward from Nanning."

"What day did you join the battle?"

"Because the roads were destroyed, our progress was very slow. On November 23rd, I began to join the battle. In early December, we arrived in Jiutang. Soon after arriving, we encountered a fierce attack by the Chinese army. Because we resisted for a long time, we were mentally exhausted. One day, we were ordered to rest in a certain place. Unexpectedly, a cannonball flew over and hit us directly. All the soldiers in the squad died at the time, and four others were seriously injured. It was completely wiped out." Speaking of this, he raised his head and looked deeply for a moment before continuing, "I was completely convinced of the power of the Chinese army's artillery fire at this time. All my comrades-in-arms were also extremely frightened."

"What units were you in around Nanning and Kunlun Pass, and how many troops were there?"

"This time, the entire Fifth Division attacked Nanning, including the 11th, 21st, 41st, and 42nd Regiments. I am a private first class in the 21st Regiment, a light machine gunner. The regiment commander is Yamaki. The Japanese army divides each platoon into four squads. The first and second squads are light and heavy machine guns, the third squad is rifles, with 15 rifles (the whole company has 50 rifles), the fourth squad is grenade launchers (with 20 grenade launchers). Each person is issued five or six hand grenades and 120 bullets each time. This time, because the roads were destroyed, the heavy artillery was left in the rear and could not be brought. There are only mountain guns and field guns here, a total of four. This division is our basic Japanese unit. The soldiers are all Japanese. There are no Koreans, Taiwanese, or other nationalities."

"As far as I know, the 21st Regiment is in Kunlun Pass, the 42nd Regiment is in Jiutang, and the others are on the Nanning line. The cavalry follows the division headquarters in Nanning."

"How many casualties did you have in Kunlun Pass?"

"In Kunlun Pass, we began to experience the Chinese attacking army's artillery fire from the 21st. This time, the Chinese army's artillery fire was fierce, which was truly shocking." He widened his eyes. "The Chinese army's courage in attacking was also unprecedented. Hand grenades and machine guns were constantly thrown and fired, making it impossible for us to raise our heads. We often couldn't get anything to eat for several days. We didn't dare to go outside even during the day to relieve ourselves. I don't understand why the Chinese army can bring so many hand grenades. Look," he pointed to his wounds, "these many wounds were all caused by hand grenades."

"Although the losses of the Japanese army cannot be estimated, in Tongxing alone, a Japanese company guarding the area, commanded by the battalion commander, resulted in the platoon leader being killed in action, the company commander being blinded, the battalion commander fleeing, and the soldiers suffering even greater casualties. Fortunately, only one or two people survived in each squad on average."

"How did your rear provide supplies?"

"The Yongqin Road has been repaired and opened to traffic on December 5th. Now, 100 trucks are used to transport supplies and ammunition to the front every day."

"How were you captured?"

"On a mountain near Kunlun Pass, I was wounded by hand grenades from the Chinese army's assault. Knowing that I could not survive, I desperately wanted to die quickly, but my injuries were too severe to move. My companions were wounded, dead, or fleeing, and could not provide assistance. After waiting for three days without food or water, I was on the verge of death when I encountered your search team. I am truly grateful for such preferential treatment after being captured." "What are your thoughts on the Sino-Japanese War?" "I don't want the war to be prolonged. I hope it will end soon and restore peace in East Asia." "But you have occupied so many of our places. How can there be peace?"

He stubbornly replied, "We originally wanted to fight to Nanjing, and you would apologize, and then there could be a peaceful truce. But you still fought desperately, so we have to keep fighting."

What is your impression of being captured now? "I only know how to follow the orders of my superiors. I was originally prepared to die in battle, but I never expected to be captured today. I hope to return home as soon as possible."

This completely shows the evil consequences of being subjected to extremely deep anesthetic education.

The sky was completely dark. This interrogation can be considered to have come to an end. As for the outcome of this prisoner, he was later sent to a higher-level agency and transferred to a prisoner-of-war camp. His injuries were quite serious. If he can recover, he should thank the "Chinese army's hand grenades," which caused him temporary pain, but in the end, liberated him from the rule of the warlords and the threat of death, and allowed him to enjoy a quiet life in the internment camp.

### Ningbo's Largest Enterprise, Hefeng Cotton Mill, Carelessly Burned Down - Losses Reaching Over Six Million, Fortunately All Workers Were Safe

Ningbo Correspondence: The Hefeng Cotton Mill in Jiangdong, this city, is the largest enterprise in Ningbo, with more than 2,500 male and female workers. General Manager Yu Zuochen is a leader in the Yu Rong community of this city. Since taking office, he has coincided with the outbreak of the War of Resistance, and the price of yarn has risen. Last year, when the European war broke out, the source of foreign yarn was scarce, and the business of the mill became more and more developed. Up to now, the profit has reached a huge three or four million yuan. At about 9 a.m. on the 20th of this month, the engine of the mill caught fire due to prolonged friction and heat. Although rescue was carried out at the time, it spread so quickly that it could not be extinguished for a while. So, the alarm was sounded, and in an instant, the fire had pierced the roof. It was too late to use the mill's own water dragon and fire extinguisher to extinguish the fire. Fire trucks from the fire brigade and various volunteer dragons rushed to the rescue, but the mill was located in a remote area, and the cotton yarn was easy to burn, so once it spread, it was impossible to control. By the time the dragons arrived, the fire had spread from the cotton batting room to the roving room. The fire was so bright that it could be seen from dozens of miles away, and the black smoke filled the entire city. It took five hours to extinguish the fire until 2 p.m. It is estimated that five engine rooms, seven ginning rooms, twelve reeling rooms, eight roving rooms, sixteen fine yarn rooms, six bale rooms, six cotton sliver rooms, and more than ten other rooms, totaling more than 70 rooms, were burned down. The estimated loss of houses is more than 100,000 yuan, the loss of yarn is more than 300,000 yuan, and all the textile machinery is destroyed. According to the current price, it is estimated to be worth about four or five million yuan. The total loss is more than six million yuan. The mill has fire insurance of two million yuan. Fortunately, the workers in the mill fled through the doors one after another after the fire broke out, and no one was killed or injured. The mill's office, warehouse, power generation room, and conference hall were fortunately not affected. The old engineer of the mill's engine room, Ge Changming, was taken to the 5th Branch of the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. The local officials of this city, Commander Guo, Commissioner Xu, County Chief Yu, and Secretary-General Wu, etc., all came to the mill to inspect the damage one after another, as the mill was burned down and the losses were huge. They ordered the person in charge of the mill to raise funds for the aftermath. The General Labor Union and the Cotton Spinning Industry Labor Union also sent personnel to the mill to express their condolences to the workers. It was pointed out that after the mill was burned down, 2,000 workers suddenly became unemployed, directly and indirectly affecting the livelihoods of more than 10,000 people. That night, telegrams were sent to the provincial party and government authorities, appealing for relief.

### Wuxi City Gate - Residents Have Difficulty Entering and Exiting - Japanese and Puppets Force the Issuance of "County Resident Certificates"

Wuxi Correspondence: Since the puppet county government of Xiyi was urged by the Japanese to divide the city into "four districts," it has forced residents to obtain "county resident certificates." The people in the city have many concerns, especially the young and strong, fearing that the Japanese and puppets will force them to enlist, so only about half of the residents have obtained the certificates, based on the current registered population in the urban area. Moreover, after the puppet governor was killed, people who do not have "county resident certificates" are not allowed to enter or leave the city, causing the most suffering to many shanty town residents from Jiangbei, who are rickshaw pullers, vendors, and factory workers. Without county resident certificates, they cannot leave the city, and their lives have been greatly affected.

### Measures for Secondary School Graduates to Apply for Reissuance of Graduation Certificates - Zhejiang Education Department Revises Circular for Compliance

(Jinhua Correspondence) The Provincial Department of Education issued a circular in the twentieth year regarding the procedures for secondary school graduates to apply for reissuance of lost certificates, requiring compliance with the procedures for reissuing graduation certificates for secondary schools in Zhejiang Province. Now, the reissuance of graduation certificates is changed to the issuance of graduation qualification certificates, and the previously issued procedures for reissuing graduation certificates are revised to the "Measures for Secondary School Graduates in Zhejiang Province to Apply for the Issuance of Graduation Qualification Certificates" as follows: (1) Secondary school graduates who apply for a certificate due to loss should first list their name, origin, age, graduating school and year, and the reason and year of the loss of the certificate in a detailed advertisement in a well-known local newspaper in the province for three days, declaring the lost certificate invalid. (2) The graduate should submit three full sheets of the aforementioned newspaper (note that they must not be cut and pasted) and two recent 2.5-inch half-length unhatted photos to the original graduating school for forwarding to this department for verification. (3) After the original graduating school receives the graduate's application, it should immediately check whether the graduate's original graduation record is consistent, whether the loss of the certificate is accurate, and whether the submitted newspaper complies with the provisions of the above article. If the review is correct, it should prepare a document responsible for proving and submit it to this department for verification and issuance of a graduation qualification certificate. (4) Junior high school graduates who have already graduated from high school or above, or high school graduates who have already graduated from junior college or above, may not apply for the issuance of a junior high school or high school graduation qualification certificate. The original graduating school should, when the graduate applies, verify whether the graduate has graduated from high school or junior college or above and handle it accordingly. (5) These measures shall be issued and implemented by the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education.

### Zhejiang Education in Revival (I)

(Jinhua Correspondence) Education in various counties in western Zhejiang was very developed in the past. According to the statistics of the Department of Education before the war, there were a total of 39 kindergartens, 1,872 primary schools, and 219 complete primary schools (including 101 central primary schools) in western Zhejiang. There were a total of 52 secondary schools, including junior high schools, high schools, normal schools, vocational schools, and special schools for both boys and girls. There were four junior colleges and above, namely, National Zhejiang University, Hangzhou Art College, Provincial Medical and Pharmaceutical College, and Private Zhijiang University. In the winter of the 26th year of the Republic of China, the Japanese army landed in Jinshanwei, and the Chinese army withdrew from the Jinghu Road and Huhang Road. Soon, Hangzhou also fell. At that time, most of the counties in western Zhejiang suffered the devastation of the Japanese army, and the other counties adjacent to the war zone were also in a tense situation and the order was quite chaotic. Except for a few middle schools and junior colleges and above that were relocated to the rear in advance, the rest of the entire education business almost completely fell into a state of stagnation. Between the summer and autumn of the 27th year, Anji Xiaofeng was recovered successively, and the war situation became increasingly stable. The county administration of various counties in western Zhejiang has entered a normal state. Even in the counties that have fallen, the county administration can be promoted without hindrance. At the same time, the education business has gradually recovered its old appearance through the efforts of the Provincial Department of Education and the local authorities of various counties.

Among the secondary schools after the war, the earliest established was Moganshan Remedial Middle School. In the autumn of the 26th year, the Shanghai War broke out. At that time, the number of Chinese and foreign people who were on the mountain for summer vacation reached about 10,000. Because of the war, they could not leave the mountain. Therefore, Ms. Shen Yiyun (the widow of the late Huang Yingbai), the chairman of the Mogan Elementary School Board, initiated the organization of the Moganshan Remedial Middle School, enrolling more than 80 students and hiring seven or eight teachers. After classes started for more than two months, in mid-November, the situation in western Zhejiang changed suddenly and was very critical. Mrs. Huang, in response to the request of the residents on the mountain, left Moganshan to go to the rear, so the school was suspended. In February of the 27th year, although Hangzhou and Wukang had both fallen, the Japanese army had climbed the mountain several times, but because of the protection of foreign expatriates and churches, they did not suffer any losses. On the contrary, the number of residents who took refuge on the mountain increased more than before because of the large number of people who withdrew from Hangjiahu. At that time, many teachers from Dongwu Third Middle School in Wuxing stayed on the mountain, and the out-of-school youths on the mountain asked them to set up a Moganshan Temporary Middle School. This temporary middle school lasted for less than half a year. By the end of July, Dongwu University and its affiliated middle school had resumed classes in Shanghai, and most of the teachers from the Temporary Middle School left the mountain, so the Temporary Middle School was suspended again. However, there were still many students left, so the Moganshan Chinese and Foreign Refugee Relief Association took over. At that time, in addition to charging students a small amount of tuition, they also received a lot of help from Mrs. Huang. In the winter of the 27th year, they applied to the Department of Education for registration, and were ordered to change to Wukang County War-Time Remedial Middle School.

At present, the school has a total of 122 students, of which about 80% are from Wukang. The funding for the autumn semester of the 28th year was 900 yuan, of which the Provincial Department of Education subsidized 60 yuan per month, the Mogan Elementary School Board subsidized 40 yuan per month, and the Central Relief Committee subsidized 300 yuan. The school building uses the former Moganshan Railway Hotel building, which has clear springs and bamboo forests, and the environment is very beautiful. In recent months, as the Chinese army has besieged Wukang, the sound of clear gunfire can be heard on Mogan Mountain. Generally, the students can study with peace of mind. The sound of music and singing does not stop in the sound of gunfire, which is really very moving. The principal of the school is currently Mr. Zhang Jingxin, the head of the Political Section of Wukang County. Next semester, the school will expand the number of students, and the budget has been increased to more than 1,900 yuan.

There are currently three provincial middle schools in western Zhejiang. The Provincial First Temporary Middle School is located in Tianmu Mountain, Yuqian. Its predecessor was the First District Joint War-Time Remedial Middle School, which was founded by Mr. Wang Yidong, the Administrative Inspector of the First District, in the autumn of the 27th year. In February of the 28th year, it was ordered by the Provincial Department of Education to change to Zhejiang West Middle School. In June, it was ordered by the Ministry of Education to change to the Provincial First Temporary Middle School in Zhejiang West, and the Second and Third Temporary Middle Schools were established in Xiaofeng and Changhua, respectively.

Enrollment is exceptionally enthusiastic. There were 44 students in the last semester, and there were no empty seats in the classroom.

Starting this semester, it will add classes, expand enrollment, revise the curriculum, and hire more teachers. In addition to reducing tuition as much as possible, it will also set up fee reduction and free tuition methods. There are preferential methods for group enrollment. The school is scheduled to open on February 10th.

Lixin Accounting Tutoring School: Lixin Accounting Tutoring School, located at 406 Jiangxi Road, will offer junior high school and university groups starting this semester. Among them, the university group has hired experts to serve as professors at high salaries, so the tuition fee is slightly higher than the original departments, but 100 reduced-fee places are set up to remedy this. Those who aspire to study but whose families are indeed poor may obtain a letter of proof from the original school or service agency to apply for a reduced fee. It is heard that the amount of the reduced fee can be reduced by one-quarter to three-quarters of the original tuition fee.

### Blatant Armed Intimidation: Situation in West Shanghai Worsening. A Public Bus Ticket Seller Narrowly Escapes Harm from Puppet Waterway Officials.

According to the English-language "North China Daily News", yesterday (28th) afternoon, four armed Chinese men, believed to be personnel from the Dadao government, boarded a public bus in front of Zhao Feng Park in an attempt to assassinate a ticket seller. They fled only when an armored vehicle of the International Settlement Volunteer Corps approached. The details are as follows:

(Evicted for Refusing to Buy a Ticket) Around 1:00 PM yesterday afternoon, a public bus was traveling east from Zhao Feng Park when a passenger refused to pay the fare. The ticket seller insisted that all passengers must purchase tickets, or else leave the bus. The passenger then threatened the ticket seller with harm. However, after sizing up the individual, the ticket seller, when the bus stopped at Edinburgh Road, evicted the passenger from the bus.

(Seeking Revenge, the Perpetrator and Companions Fail to Find Their Target) Afterwards, the bus returned to the Bund and then back again. About one hour and fifteen minutes later, as the bus arrived back at Edinburgh Road, someone on the roadside loudly warned the ticket seller. The ticket seller was quick-witted and immediately exited the bus, which continued westward. Just as it arrived in front of Zhao Feng Park, four Chinese men boarded the bus, one of whom was the passenger who had refused to purchase a ticket. They each drew military Mauser rifles and searched for the ticket seller. Upon learning that the ticket seller had left the bus, they were furious.

(Two Beaten in Anger) They used their rifle butts to knock out the ticket collector on the bus, and violently struck the Russian ticket inspector, Pino Korolov, who boarded the bus at the Zhao Feng Park stop. Pino felt slightly dizzy after being hit and quickly gestured to an armored vehicle of the International Settlement Volunteer Corps patrolling nearby. The armored vehicle accelerated towards the public bus, and the four thugs fled on foot into a lane in the 'bandit territory'.

### Handling of Price-Controlled Rice Seamlessly Implemented. The Ordered 15,000 Bags of Broken Rice Have Arrived in Shanghai. Group Order of Rice Has Been Continued with an Additional 2,000 Bags.

The Shanghai Price-Controlled Rice Committee encouraged donations to order foreign rice and entrusted rice shops to handle the controlled prices for the benefit of the common people. It was quite beneficial. The 20,068 bags of broken rice already purchased from the Shanghai market are about to be sold out. The 15,000 bags of ordered broken rice ordered from the West have already arrived in Shanghai in three batches this afternoon. It has been decided that the control and sale will be seamlessly implemented after the previously purchased goods are completed.

(Sustained Price-Control Rice Sales) In order to carry out the control rice sales on a long-term basis, in addition to actively encouraging and soliciting donations for the control price of rice, the association has continued to purchase 5,000 bags of broken rice from the Shanghai market, and has already completed the transaction and paid the bill. It has also entrusted Heyi Foreign Firm and Jianyuan Firm to continue ordering 11,000 bags of broken rice, which are expected to arrive in Shanghai before February 15. As for the 50 control rice shops in the two concessions, the control rice sales have been carried out as usual in recent days. Due to the high rice prices in the market, rice buyers are very enthusiastic. Each store sells 50 bags per day as scheduled, and fortunately no incidents have occurred in each place since the police authorities sent police to maintain order.

(Group Purchase) In order to adjust the Shanghai people's food supply, the Shanghai People's Food Adjustment Association organized a group purchase of foreign rice. Various agencies, organizations, factories, companies, and firms have enthusiastically entrusted them with orders. After the first batch of 6,000 bags arrived in Shanghai, the Jincheng Bank advanced the funds and has already delivered the goods to each purchaser. The second batch of 10,000 bags was entrusted to Jianyuan Firm on the 22nd of this month, with Saigon No. 2 rice at 48.83 yuan per bag, scheduled to arrive in Shanghai before February 15th, and will be advanced funds for delivery to the purchasers. As of yesterday, another 2,000 bags were paid for by the Jincheng Bank, and as soon as 5,000 bags accumulate, an order will be placed.

### Salvation Army Continues to Distribute Food. With a Small Amount of Salted Vegetables. The Poor Benefit Greatly.

According to the "Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury," the local Salvation Army has been sending trucks loaded with hot food to distribute to the poor on the streets of the central district every night for the past five days. And when distributing food last night (28th), they attached a small amount of salted vegetables, so that the poor could eat the food and swallow it easily. If resources permit, they will also add hot tea. The Salvation Army, in view of the fact that many beggars who roam the streets all day do not know where to go at night, and therefore cannot receive the benefits of the Army's aid, boiled four barrels of hot rice yesterday afternoon and drove to the western district in trucks. For every beggar they saw, they distributed a bag of rice, distributing a total of 200 bags. The results of the experiment were quite satisfactory. In the past five days, the Salvation Army has received donations amounting to 14,500 yuan. If donations from all walks of life continue to be enthusiastic in the future, the Army will prepare several tricycle carts to carry food and distribute hot food throughout the city according to need.

### Ningbo Steamer Passengers Crowded. Ning Shao Telegram Reports Improvement in War Situation. Passengers on Shanghai-Wenzhou Ships Are Making Requests.

Yesterday, the local financial community received a telegram from Shaoxing reporting, "The Chinese army launched an attack on Xiaoshan and once stormed into the city. The battle was extremely fierce." Then, at 2:50 PM, another telegram was received stating, "The Japanese troops at Kunshan, after being severely beaten, have collapsed to the riverside and will not be difficult to annihilate." According to people from Hangzhou, the Chinese army transferred a strong force and secretly crossed the river at a certain location, joining forces with the guerrillas in western Zhejiang to launch a counterattack on Hangzhou. On the night of the 24th, large fires broke out in the suburbs of Hangzhou, and the Japanese troops in the city were shocked and fled in panic. Yesterday afternoon, the local shipping industry also received a telegram from Ningbo, "It's raining," the situation in Ningbo and Shaoxing is quiet.

(Passengers Crowded on De Ping Bound for Zhenhai) The Shanghai-Ningbo shipping route was affected by repeated operations outside Zhenhai Port, and the loading and unloading of goods by the ships was affected, resulting in delays in the voyage. The number of passengers going to Ningbo is increasing, coupled with the tense situation in eastern Zhejiang, and most Zhejiang people want to return home to see the situation, so that all passenger tickets were sold out long before the De Ping returned to Shanghai. The ship sailed to Zhenhai at 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon. A reporter from the Daguang News Agency personally inspected the port and estimated that there were more than 3,000 passengers, and the congestion was no less than that during the Shanghai war. It is said that this trip is a short trip, and it will still return to Shanghai before the end of the lunar year.

(Moufu Ship Returning to Shanghai Begins Selling Tickets) The German Lich and Co.'s Moufu ship has finished loading goods outside Zhenhai Port. Yesterday, they received a telegram from Captain Belker stating that they had decided to set sail back to Shanghai today and will arrive in port tomorrow morning. The company decided to sail to Zhenhai as usual on February 2nd. Starting yesterday, they have started selling tickets, and it is said that more than half have been sold in an instant. In addition, the Norwegian Dapu ship also sailed to Zhenhai yesterday, but only carried cargo and did not carry passengers. The Far East Company's Hana ship, after returning to Shanghai, was originally scheduled to sail to Songmen, Taizhou yesterday afternoon, but the departure was postponed to this morning due to insufficient loading of cargo.

(Requesting Passengers for Shanghai-Wenzhou Ships) Since the Japanese troops landed in Xiaoshan, eastern Zhejiang, Zhejiang people in Shanghai have complained that the Shanghai-Ningbo ships are crowded, and the land route from Shanghai to Wenzhou is inevitably more difficult than before. For convenience, they asked various ships on the Shanghai-Wenzhou line to carry passengers, but the ships were unable to agree because the authorities imposed strict restrictions and there were occasional obstructions. However, it is learned that the British ship Yonghua, which sailed from Shanghai to Wenzhou a few days ago, has not yet telegraphed whether it has entered the port.

The Shanghai Money Shops Association issued a notice to members yesterday stating: "Having opened the matter, the Executive Committee of the Third Session No. 104 on the 25th proposed a case for handling business before and after the 28th annual closing balance. After discussion, the public decided as follows: 1. The closing date for the 28th year, (resolved) February 7th is the closing date. 2.

After the Shanghai financial market was adjusted, it remained stable. The overnight loan rate stood at one corner. As for the abnormal development of various industries after their duties, all annual accounts were able to obtain a surplus. There was no tension in the market's monetary base."

### Many Chinese Houses in Nanshi Illegally Occupied. Like a Second Bandit Territory Soon After Opening. The Insider Story of Profiteering and Exploitation is Unfathomable.

According to people from Nanshi, since the iron gates of the French Concession were opened, many people living in Nanshi who had been in the war were moved by curiosity, so many people got "certificates" and went to visit their former residences after more than a year of separation, or the houses were still the same, but the bird's nest was occupied by pigeons, and the scene was no longer the same, or the houses were already destroyed, and they sighed at the rubble, and they were filled with infinite sadness and returned. The trouble of getting a "certificate" made people exhausted. In addition to finding a guarantor, it cost a dime to get a "pseudo-citizen certificate" and half a yuan to get a "smallpox certificate", which was tantamount to a poll tax of 60 cents per person. The most intense backlash recently has been property disputes.

(Den of All Evils) Rumors have it that after the concession authorities and the Japanese side will jointly crack down on the general opium dens, gambling dens, brothels, and all kinds of prostitution places and sales gold dens in the bandit area of ​​western Shanghai, they all think that Nanshi is the best place for the second bandit territory in western Shanghai, so they have invested in renting houses, and more and more speculators are profiteering, and the disputes are becoming more and more intense, because most of the houses in Nanshi that have not been destroyed (including the refugee areas) have been occupied by people with special forces, and the original old tenants have no way to advise, or they intend to pay more, and dig up rents from non-permanent residents or non-tenants in the house.

(Bullying Holding) Therefore, there are many people who enjoy the benefits. Some rent directly from the landlord, but after paying the fee, the owner cannot make the current occupants move out. There are even some poor people who want to return to their hometowns, but they cannot enter because their houses are occupied, so they turn to the owners to negotiate, and disputes arise in twists and turns, which is no different from a confused account. If the owners are more powerful, they make money by taking the opportunity to buy and sell, first requiring the old tenants to pay off the rent within a limited time (without specifying whether it was before or after the war) before they are allowed to continue renting, but when they try to rent, the conditions are harsh, and they retreat despite knowing it. After the deadline, the owners rent it to illegal traders at high prices, so the strong bully the weak, and the insider story is dark and complicated, and outsiders do not know even a fraction of it. According to the News Agency, it is heard that after the Japanese side plans to completely open the iron gates connecting the French Concession in Nanshi, the Entertainment Department Supervision Office currently set up in western Shanghai will notify all financial venues to move to Nanshi for business. After the news was revealed, the heads of various gambling dens once met to discuss it.

### The Effect of the New Remittance System: The Borrowing Quota Increased to 35 Million Yuan. The Remittance Discount Rate Fell to 24 Yuan.

The Shanghai Silver and Money Industry Association has been handling the use of inter-bank remittances in order to adjust the capital of the industry and supply the needs of industry and commerce. Since its implementation, due to the reliable guarantee and widespread circulation in the market, the borrowing quota of each bank has increased sharply, and the overall remittance discount rate has been suppressed. The details are as follows:

Total Borrowing Amount

Each bank provides collateral: (1) major goods, (2) securities, (3) real estate. After the association assesses the price, 70% is allowed to be used for inter-bank remittance. The approved total borrowing amount is recorded on the left: 14,751,000 yuan as of July 31, 22,119,500 yuan as of August 31, 23,063,000 yuan as of September 30, 22,897,000 yuan as of the end of last month, 22,798,000 yuan as of January 30, and 35,935,000 yuan as of December 31.

Discount Suppression

In order to stabilize the Shanghai market, the Ministry of Finance stipulated the inter-bank remittance system. Then, due to the profiteering of small money shops, a bad phenomenon of remittance discount was created. Although the Ministry has repeatedly ordered it to be cracked down on, it is difficult to implement the crackdown due to the Shanghai environment. The discount rate was as high as 280 yuan per thousand. Then, the Bank United Reserve was entrusted by the Central Bank of China, Communications Bank, and the Three Banks to find a way to suppress it, and the temporary discount rate was set at 50 yuan, so it was slightly stabilized. After the implementation of the new remittance system, it has obtained the trust of the bill holders, so the discount rate has naturally fallen to 24 yuan.

### Rice Shops Association Saves Annual Fees: To Relieve Refugee Children. Yesterday's Meeting of Members Locally Donated 7,000 Yuan.

In response to the Shanghai Refugee Children's Education and Care Institute's call to save money on the New Year's holiday to relieve refugee children, the local Rice Shops Association held a meeting of members at the Atlantic Restaurant at 6:00 PM last night to discuss the plan. About 60 people including Qu Zhenhua, Shi Hongxun, Xu Meisheng, Chen Shaolian, Zhang Nianxuan, Lu Wenshao, and Zhang Guixin attended. First, Zhang Nianxuan stood up and reported the purpose of the meeting. Then, Zhang Wenshao, a member of the Standing Committee of the Association, reported, saying, "I am very grateful to all the members for their efforts and assistance in handling the controlled price of rice. At the same time, today I am also very grateful to everyone for their spirit and enthusiasm in participating in the rain as the director of the Education and Care Institute." The members who attended the meeting all agreed that since the establishment of the Refugee Children's Education and Care Institute, its achievements have been remarkable and have been well received by all walks of life. Today, we should respond to the Institute's call to save money and relieve difficulties, and we should do our best to promote it in order to fulfill our responsibilities. Therefore, we immediately donated on the spot, and the situation was extremely enthusiastic. The number of donations totaled more than 7,000 yuan. The industry's advocacy of saving money on the New Year's holiday to relieve refugee children is indeed commendable. It is heard that the local Silver and Money Industry Association and other associations will also hold meetings to discuss the ways to save money and relieve difficulties.

### Hongsheng Wharf: Warehouse Occupied. Japanese Yamashita Company Moves In. Preparing to Dock Yangtze River Liners.

The Hongsheng Warehouse Wharf on Pudong Muddy Beach, formerly owned by the Chinese-owned Sanbei Shipping Company, covers an area of more than 20 acres and has several complete warehouses and three wharves. After the Shanghai war, the company's Hunan warehouse was destroyed by fire, and the wharf was sunk to the bottom of the river, making it impossible to resume operations. Therefore, the Hongsheng Warehouse has also stopped business for more than two years, and because it is located in the occupied area, it is impossible to start sorting it out. It is learned that just as the Japanese are planning to monopolize shipping in the Pudong South City, the Japanese Yamashita Company has occupied the Hongsheng Warehouse and is planning to resume operations. A few days ago, a Japanese person entered the warehouse for inspection, and several Chinese people who came with him ordered the staff to sort out the warehouse wharf and hang up the Yamashita sign, preparing to dock the Yangtze River liners and compete with foreign shipping companies when the lower reaches of the Yangtze River are open.

### Zhang Huabin Shipyard of the Dredging Bureau: Has a Deadline for Return.

The Japanese side has agreed to return the dredgers seized by the Dredging Bureau, but it has not yet been realized. Recently, the Customs Commissioner of the Jianghai Customs Bureau re-negotiated with the Japanese side and allowed the release of dredgers such as the Haima and Haibao, and surveying ships such as the Lijiang and Liyong. As of now, it has not been seen in practice. The Bureau is now making preparations for the resumption of construction and has decided to first measure the water depth in the Huangpu River. The Bureau's Zhang Huabin Shipyard is quite large. It is now learned that the Customs has agreed with the Japanese side to return it by the end of this month. However, the interior needs large-scale repairs, and it will be difficult to restore it to its original state in a short period of time.

### Using Twin Sons: Begging on the Street. Charged with Fraud.

Wang Qishen, who lives at No. 79, Dakangli, Kangdi Road, used to make a living by teaching. Recently, he came up with a bizarre idea and used his 12-year-old twin sons, Zeng Guangyuan and Zeng Guangbo, to beg on the streets. Wang took the money they begged for to fill his own pockets. Yesterday, when the Zeng twins were begging in Yu Qiaqing, they were spotted by Fang Teerhua, the flower donation squad Western police head of the Laoza Gate Police Station, No. 1013, Sandao Head. They took the two children back to the police station and learned of their secret. Then, Wang was arrested. Yesterday morning, Zhang Shizhu, the police station's lawyer, sued Wang to the Special First Court on charges of fraud. After being questioned by Judge Fang, Wang was given an appropriate punishment.

### Accounting Year Final Accounts: Suggestions for Actual Receipts and Payments – Opinions Expressed by Accountant He Yuanlai

Accountant He Yuanlai, yesterday, published an article "Preliminary Proposal for an Actual Receipts and Payments Final Account System." With the year-end approaching, it offers valuable insights for the business community. The original text is recorded below:

As the year draws to a close, the accounting year for various industries is also nearing its end. All those in charge of accounting consider the final accounting after the grand summation to be their responsibility. There are two methods of preparing final accounts: one is the accrual accounting system, and the other is the cash accounting system. The former has already been thoroughly elaborated upon by accountants, so there is no need to reiterate it. The latter has received little attention, but considering the actual situation of society, the latter is more urgently needed for research than the former. This is because the old-style accounting methods in our country are deeply rooted and have strong self-confidence, unlike the incomplete Western single-entry accounting that urgently needs reform. I recall that in the 26th year of the Republic of China, when attending discussions at the Wu County Chamber of Commerce Accounting Research Class, representatives from various industries did not pay much attention to the first phase of accounting theory, but they all talked with great interest about the second phase of the cash accounting method and the basis for taxation. This gives a glimpse of the situation.

According to the author's observations from over ten years of external contact, most people use the old accounting system. Viewed from the perspective of Western accounting, it may seem like a mess, but in reality, with a little整理, it is still orderly. Under the conditions of not changing the accounting methods or altering the ledger, it is entirely possible to use the Western-style ledger trial balance as a basis for the final accounts. What is most valuable is that all the legitimate final account reports that old-style accounting personnel have always considered impossible can actually be easily resolved. The so-called actual taxable amount of actual receipts and payments has a solid basis. If this is the case, the problem of legally expressing the actual amount that various industries worry about has long ceased to be a problem.

Cash accounting calculates the net profit based on actual receipts and payments. The tax law has long stipulated this. Therefore, various industries can find solutions to the following problems that they have always considered insurmountable: (1) Uncollected Accounts Included as Profit. Old-style accounting does not usually treat customer debts that have not been cleared after the year-end as income for the current year. It is generally believed that they should not be arbitrarily added to the net profit, as this would be considered虛帳實報 (reporting on paper and not in reality). The implication is that the uncollected customer debts after the year-end indicate, by habit, that it is still uncertain whether the customer will pay or whether they will pay in full. If, at the time of the final account, they are forced to be included in the collected accounts and calculated together, it seems unreasonable, especially during wartime, which adds another layer of risk. For example, the losses suffered by various industries in the 26th year of the Republic of China were mostly due to the non-collection of uncollected accounts. If we must forcibly add this account to the calculation of net profit, we may have tax obligations, which is indeed inappropriate. If various industries adopt the cash accounting system, they do not need to be included in the calculation of the actual amount. This is the first solution. However, if uncollected accounts are not treated as profits, unpaid goods should also not be treated as expenses. Although most ordinary commercial firms have cleared the payment for goods before the year-end, if there are any that have not been cleared, they should be treated as unpaid. This should be noted.

(2) Uncollected Post-Dated Checks Included as Profit. In commercial practice, it is very common to pay for goods with post-dated checks or promissory notes. This type of note, which cannot be discounted or circulated, is not treated as cash by custom and is considered a disguised form of uncollected account. You can follow the method in the first section to calculate your actual amount as the basis for accounting. A corresponding科目 (subject) should be established to handle it. Once the note matures and cash is actually received, it will be treated as actual income. In this way, uncollected post-dated checks will not be mixed into the net profit for taxation, so as to avoid suffering losses when they are not honored when they mature. This is the second solution. However, unpaid similar post-dated checks should still be treated as unpaid expenses. This should not be overlooked.

(3) Provide for Bad Debt. According to the cash accounting system, uncollected accounts are not treated as profits, so the method of providing for bad debt that is not allowed by the tax law can be avoided. Because all uncollected accounts are not included in the calculation of the actual amount, it is actually like fully providing for bad debts, without making a provision for bad debts. This is the third solution of the cash accounting system.

However, customer debts, goods, post-dated checks, etc., are divided into last year and this year. The cause and effect cannot be explained in a few words. Due to space limitations in this article, it will be discussed in detail in the "Old Accounting Final Account Class" that will be launched soon. In short, whether it is income tax or profit tax, it can be calculated using the consistent method of actual receipts and payments, as a basis for allocating or paying taxes. Accounting is a social science, and the key is to meet the needs of society. I dare to propose the cash accounting system, a thousand thoughts and one gain. I hope all sectors will enlighten me.

### French Concession Pass: Exchange New Pass and Extend Validity

The curfew passes issued by the French Police Department, old yellow passes, were originally scheduled to be exchanged for new passes before February 1st for use. All old passes will be invalidated from that date. It is now heard that the French authorities have received less than two thousand people who have exchanged their old passes for new ones. At the same time, the staff of the interviewing section have been working extremely hard recently, and the procedures for exchanging passes are very meticulous. It will definitely not be completed before the end of the month, so it is planned to extend the exchange period. However, it is still hoped that citizens who have not exchanged their passes will go to exchange them as soon as possible so that everything will be uniform, and the curfew can be enforced.

### New Year's Eve Dinner Funds Transferred to Refugee Relief Donations

Recently, the weather has been extraordinarily cold, and the indoor temperature is also below freezing. The refugees are suffering from hunger and cold. Their pain can be imagined. The colleagues of Yuan Cheng Money Shop in Yongning Lane, Henan Road, this city, initiated a donation of one hundred yuan from their New Year's Eve dinner funds to refugee relief. The full amount has been sent to the Pudong Bank for collection. The colleagues of this bank are concerned about the refugees, which shows their enthusiasm for public welfare.

### Amidst Public Hardship, Landlords Increasing Rents Again: Renji Lane, etc., Follow Suit

At a time when prices are soaring and people are struggling, the trend of landlords increasing rents is rampant again, which is a social problem worthy of attention. Renji Lane on Xinzha Road has recently been notified by the rental department of the foreign merchant Louis Dreyfus & Co. to increase the rent by 30%. The tenants believe that they have already increased the water bill last year, and it is difficult to bear any further burden. They decided to ask the landlord, Renji Hall, to show compassion and cancel the rent increase. The rent increase case in Siwen Lane has been resolved by the tenants paying additional water fees. The huge rent increase by the landlord of Hongrui Lane on Xinzha Road is still at a stalemate. The tenants of this lane received a reply from the landlord yesterday, saying, "We have received your letter of January 8th and understand your situation. After investigation, the rent of your premises must be increased. In fact, the original rent is very low, considering the combined price of the land and house. The prices of land and houses have been low for years, while land donations, repairs, electricity bills, etc. have repeatedly increased. Therefore, it is necessary to increase the rent to subsidize these expenses. Now that you are speaking of many years of friendship between landlord and tenant, you should understand this unavoidable situation. I hope that you will handle it according to the rent increase method in the previous letter. Thank you very much." The tenants believe that the water bill was already paid by the tenants last year, and the so-called increase in electricity bills in the letter is a matter for the tenants. Therefore, they are determined to continue to fight for their rights.

### 1939: A Review of Shanghai's Industry (4)

The Municipal Council's Annual Report - Part 3

Compensation for Death and Injury

The U.S. Court for China heard a case in 1937 in which an employee of a company sued for compensation for injuries, as detailed in the previous year's annual report. The case concluded last February, with the plaintiff winning and awarded US$2,000 in damages. The Court stated that ordering employers to provide relief to injured employees was consistent with the spirit and purpose of U.S. federal law, and that the judgment was legally sound. All Chinese and foreign factories in the city provide compensation to workers who die in the line of duty. According to Chinese factory law, factories must pay 50 yuan for funeral expenses when a worker dies in an accident. Currently, this amount is insufficient due to rising prices. Some factories provide compensation of up to 400 to 500 yuan. A Chinese factory owner, in accordance with Article 45, Paragraph 3 of the Factory Law, paid 300 yuan in compensation, plus two years' wages and 50 yuan for funeral expenses, totaling 746 yuan. As for injured workers, it is rare for them to receive adequate compensation from the factory, even if they are permanently disabled. In the event of a serious accident, the factory usually pays medical expenses, but some employers believe that once they have paid medical expenses, they may not pay part or all of the wages. An employee of a foreign factory lost an eye due to injury. The factory agreed to retain the worker and provide one year's wages in accordance with the provisions of the Factory Law as consolation. This approach is quite satisfactory.

Steam Pressure Machinery

Last year, progress was made in the inspection and registration of steam pressure machinery. The total number of registered machines was 978, including 827 boilers, which were registered last year, although they had not been registered before. These machines account for half of the total. Much of the progress in improving steam pressure machinery is due to the careful work of a number of Chinese and foreign approved engineers, who mostly consider it their responsibility to promote the safe operation of such machinery. All registration applications are reviewed separately by the Chief Engineer of the Public Works Department. (To be continued)

### Hurricane in Japanese Waters: President Quezon Ship Wrecked and Sunk; Russian Ship Delayed in Shanghai Due to the Storm

Last week, a hurricane occurred in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Japan, causing the Philippine ship President Quezon (formerly the President Madison), with a deadweight of 14,187 tons and a net tonnage of 8,341 tons, and a length of 535 feet, which was carrying timber from Los Angeles to Shanghai, to encounter a severe hurricane when sailing through Japanese waters on the 26th of this month. It was blown near Tanegashima Island in Kagoshima Prefecture and wrecked. This news has already been reported by Japanese news agencies. It is now heard that the Russian Empress ship of the Changxing Company, which was sailing from Vancouver to the Far East this time, was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday, but was delayed due to encountering a hurricane en route. It has safely arrived in Yokohama. It left Yokohama for Kobe yesterday and will depart from Kobe for Shanghai today, expected to arrive in Shanghai on February 1st and leave Shanghai for Hong Kong and Luzon on February 2nd.

### American Church in Longzhou Burned Down: Japan Tries to Shirk Responsibility; US Lodges Formal Protest Based on a Report by a Japanese Officer

According to the Continental News, a Japanese military spokesman in Shanghai denied the U.S.'s formal protest on January 10, which stated that Japanese troops looted and burned down the American Christian Church in Longzhou, Guangxi. It was claimed that "the American church was burned down due to arson by the Chinese side, or due to the fire spreading from nearby Chinese houses." It is reported that the American protest was based on eyewitness accounts of foreigners in Longzhou at the time, while the Japanese military spokesman's statement was based on a report from a Japanese officer who participated in the invasion of Longzhou in December of last year. The spokesman continued, "The Japanese troops in Longzhou are extremely cautious so as not to damage the property of third countries on land and water. On December 3, the representative of the French Consulate in Longzhou asked the Japanese commander to issue a report to the French authorities in Hanoi and Hong Kong, stating that life and property under French jurisdiction in Longzhou were safe and sound."

A kidnapping case occurred in the Public Concession yesterday. The victim was a hardware store owner, and his whereabouts are still unknown. However, the car used by the abductors has been found by the police. He Xitang, a native of Wuxi, 31 years old, runs Yuanfeng Hardware & Iron Store at No. 5 to 13 Beishan Road, which is a large business. He himself and his family also live in the store. Yesterday, at 7:30 in the morning, six men suddenly drove up to the store in a car with license plate number 17854. The men in the car went straight into He's room. He had already gotten up to wash and was surprised to ask what they wanted. Unexpectedly, the men did not say a word. Three of them took out guns, forbidding the family from making a sound. They immediately took He out together, pushed him into the car, and drove quickly eastward along North Suzhou Road, disappearing. After the abductors fled, He's family reported the information to the Huizi police station. At around 8 o'clock, police officers from the Shishan police station discovered the car used to abduct He behind the Xin Ya Restaurant on Tiantong Road. The police station is now conducting a strict investigation of the case.

Shi Arong, a 21-year-old woman living in Fahua Township, who has some beauty (from Changshu), was lured out of her home on the afternoon of the 27th by her fellow villagers Zhang Youliang, Shi Rongtao, and Feng Genrong, on the pretext of introducing her to work in a factory. They tricked her into the Railway Inn at No. 85, Lane 510, Avenue Edward VII, and gathered in room 37 to discuss selling Shi into a brothel, and used the money obtained.

### Servants Gambled and Fired Guns in a Wealthy Merchant's Home: Doorman and Tea Boy Quarrel Over Money; One Bitterly Arrested After Firing

Zhao Zhende from Shandong and Xia Maofang from Suzhou have been employed by Shen Yanling, a wealthy real estate merchant at No. 549 Seymour Road, for more than ten years. Zhao works as the doorman at No. 1656, and Xia is a tea boy. The two have usually had good feelings for each other. Recently, due to the approaching New Year, Zhao and Xia both enjoy gambling. Therefore, they often gamble on Pai Gow in their room. Shen Erguan, the 13-year-old son of their master Shen Yanling, also joined the battle and gambled with the servants. On the morning of the 27th of this month at 10 o'clock, Xia Maofang was again the banker (Pai Gow) in the room. Zhao Zhende, Shen Erguan, and others all placed bets. Unexpectedly, Zhao and Xia had a quarrel over gambling money, which turned into a physical fight. Neither would give way. Zhao Zhende, in anger and frustration, pulled out his pistol and fired a shot, and Xia stepped forward to snatch the gun and fired four shots in return, fortunately without injuring anyone. This was discovered by Zhao Ergao, a small worker from the Public Works Department, who reported it to the Xixi No. 8 police station. The police station then reported it to the Jing'an Temple police station, which sent Chinese detective Zhao Qingkui and Western detective Hicks to take Zhao and Xia, along with a pistol, to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin filed a public prosecution for attempted murder under Article 271, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law and presented the case. Witness Zhao Ergao testified that he heard four gunshots and reported the situation to the Western police. Witness Chen Xuerong testified that he was a tea boy in the Shen family. At 10:00 AM the day before, Zhao, Xia, and the young master Erguan were gambling together. Unexpectedly, Zhao and Xia suddenly had a quarrel. Zhao

Suddenly pulled out a pistol. Seeing that the situation was not good, I ran away in a hurry. After a while, I suddenly heard four or five gunshots. Later, I learned that Zhao had fired one shot and Xia had fired four shots. Zhao Zhende confessed that when I was arguing with Xia, the pistol belt suddenly loosened. Xia suspected that I was taking the gun, so he stepped forward to grab it. I refused to let go. At that time, the gun suddenly went off, making a loud bang. Later, the gun was snatched by Xia. Fearing that I would take it back and it would be unfavorable to him, he fired four shots at the ground. Xia Maofang confessed that Zhao did fire one shot at that time. At that time, I was behind Zhao, so I desperately

Snached the gun and pulled the trigger at the ground. Unexpectedly, the bullets came out continuously. I really had no intention of killing, etc., and hired a lawyer to come to the case and request bail. Judge Xiao Peishen ruled that the case still needs to be investigated and that Shen Erguan has not arrived, so he ruled to change the date for further verification after Shen Erguan arrives. Zhao and Xia were not allowed bail.

### Bribery and Malfeasance Case: Chen Zhanxiong Appeals; Trial Concluded and Verdict Awaited Yesterday

Chen Zhanxiong, a native of Fenghua, the owner of Anlegong Dance Hall Restaurant and the manager of Ivante Dance Hall in West Shanghai, was arrested by the French police on October 2 of last year for smoking opium. After trial, the Second Special Court sentenced him to six months in prison, which could be commuted to a fine of three yuan per day, and he was detained in a detention center to quit his opium addiction. Chen, in order to seek comfort in the detention center, spent 150 yuan to bribe the guards, which was discovered by the warden, who

Searched out the evidence and sent the guards Jiang Nai, Tu Gang, Luo Zhiyi, and the prisoners Tao Yongchang, Qin Jiaqi, Chen Jusheng, and Chen Zhanxiong to the prosecutor of the Second Special Court for investigation and prosecution. The two guards Jiang and Tu fled out of fear of crime and the prosecutor ordered the arrest of the two. Chen Zhanxiong, Hong Zhang Minsheng Judge researched and concluded the trial, and sentenced Luo Zhiyi to three years in prison, Chen Zhanxiong to

Eight months in prison, Tao Yongchang and Chen Jusheng each to four months in prison, which could be commuted to a fine of one yuan per day, Qin Jiaqi to six months in prison, which could be commuted to a fine of one yuan per day. Because Chen and others were not satisfied with the judgment, they hired lawyers Jiang Yiping, Ge Zhiqin, etc. to file an appeal to the Third Branch of the High Court. Judge Wang Yue opened an investigation court to question the case, and the details have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Yang Peng, the President of the Third Branch of the High Court and the head of the Criminal Court, together with Judges Gu and Wang, and the prosecutor,

Opened a joint trial. First, the appellants stated the reasons for their appeal. The court then questioned Chen Zhanxiong about the process of paying the money. 　 The confession was the same as the confession in the investigation court. Luo Zhiyi 　 Both shirked responsibility and denied participating in this matter. After a long time of research, the court ruled that the case was clear and ordered the testimony. Chen Zhanxiong's defense lawyer Jiang Yiping 　 said that Chen Zhanxiong was actually forced to pay and was in a victimized position. Being sentenced to imprisonment was extremely unjust. If he were entrusted to sell cigarettes, he would never have paid such a high price. In the past,

There have also been similar cases of prison guards, and the amount of money was greater than this. There was no prosecution or sentencing of those who paid the money. He requested that the original judgment be revoked and that he be declared innocent. Lawyer Shan Ge Zhiqin defended Luo Zhiyi and others once. The court ordered that the debate be concluded and the verdict be announced on the 31st. The appellants were returned to custody.

### Suicide Due to Gambling: Fang Kangchang's Own Fault

Fang Kangchang, a native of Ningbo, 26 years old, lives at No. 3 Jingxing Lane, North Henan Road, and has a wife and child. Fang recently worked at the Riman Trading Company at No. 24 Waitan, earning only 27 yuan per month. It is difficult for a family of three to support themselves with this meager sum. Therefore, he often borrowed money from relatives and friends. Fang has always been fond of gambling. Since the first day of this month, he has often gone to the Tongbao stall set up by Cantonese people at No. 72 Dexing Lane, Hongkou Peng Road, to try his luck, but he has had bad luck and has lost a lot of money. He has successively borrowed 140 yuan from Indian usurers, and he is unable to repay it for a while, which is extremely anxious. Yesterday afternoon, a Japanese in the trading company gave him 20 yuan in legal tender to buy stamps. After a while, Fang was ordered to go downstairs and the driver also took out 7 yuan in national currency and asked him to buy a carton of British cigarettes (a total of 50 small boxes). At this time, Fang counted that he had 27 yuan, and suddenly his gambling interest was greatly aroused. He forgot everything and took a tram to the gambling den, resulting in returning empty-handed. Afterwards, Fang realized the mistake and was ashamed to see anyone. He suddenly had a thought and walked alone to the old garbage bridge at Suzhou Road and threw himself into the river. Fortunately, he was spotted by a boatman who quickly rescued him and called the nearby constable, who transported him to Tongren Hospital for treatment.

### Raiding a Gambling Den: Arresting Thieves and Uncovering Gambling; More Than 20 Bosses and Gamblers Arrested; Whether There Are Thieves Remains to Be Investigated

They were taken to the police station together. At 9:30, they were sent to the Fourth Criminal Court of the First Special Court.

After Judge questioned them one by one, he ordered them to be returned to custody for further questioning at a later date.

Yesterday morning, the criminal Xu was sent to the Fourth Criminal Court of the First Court. Police lawyer Zhang Shizhu prosecuted according to law. After Fang Qinghuan questioned the judge, he ordered a change of date for further verification, and the police station is now strictly pursuing the fugitives and will investigate and deal with them.

### Grain Market: Reclaimed Flour Sold for Twelve Yuan, Factory Adjustment Still in Progress

Flour

Yesterday, the flour market was secretly brisk. The wholesale prices of Number Two flour in the market, the flour factories pretended to uphold the public interest, claiming they would not increase prices, and kept the price at ten yuan. However, the price of reclaimed flour was pushed up to twelve yuan, a significant increase in secret. Therefore, a price increase is imminent, but they dare not easily export. Local customers are eagerly seeking reclaimed flour, and the supply is dwindling. Once the reclaimed flour is sold out, the flour factories can raise prices without scruples and curb demand. Yesterday, the price of Green Gun Carriage brand reached a high of twelve yuan. The price of reclaimed Armed Ship brand also rose to eleven yuan and six jiao at the same time. However, the price of Old Gun Carriage brand is related to the spot goods supplied to the market by various factories, so it remained at eleven yuan and two jiao and a half. The market is chaotic, and prices vary greatly. The issue of factory price increases is still in progress.

Wheat

Yesterday, the wheat market trend remained remarkably stable, as the source of domestic wheat is scarce, inventories are low, and the demand from Japanese flour mills and exporters remains strong. There have been reports of Chinese factories repeatedly concluding deals for imported wheat. The market is affected. The Tongyi Factory only handled 300 bags of wheat from Suzhou and Anqing, with the price remaining at the original price of twenty yuan. The market is still brewing.

### Imported Rice Falls by Three to Five Jiao, Thick Geng Rice Still Actively Traded Under the Table, Market Flooded with Inferior Goods

As the end of the lunar year approaches and the accounting period nears, the general consensus in the rice market is that local shops have already stocked up enough in previous days. Apart from slightly replenishing supplies as needed, they have no intention of buying more. Merchants from the interior have also stopped buying. The sales market throughout the city is extremely sluggish. Sellers with tight cash flow are offering price reductions, and reclaimed goods are tracking closely. As the market for various types of imported rice is more active than other goods, prices have declined. Although Number One Saigon was initially priced at forty-one yuan in the morning, the actual selling price was only forty yuan and seven jiao to five jiao. Number Two Saigon initially sold for forty yuan, but the closing price was only thirty-nine yuan and five jiao and a half, a decrease of three to five jiao compared to previous days. Other types of rice, such as Fire Pattern Rice, Tokyo Rice Tips, and Rice Broken, have seen even sharper declines, with reductions ranging from seven to eight jiao to more than one yuan. The closing price of Fire Pattern Rice previously was thirty-nine yuan and seven to eight jiao, but yesterday it only sold for thirty-nine yuan to thirty-eight yuan and six to seven jiao. Tokyo Rice Tips, especially good quality, initially sold for thirty-seven yuan and four to five jiao, then only thirty-seven yuan, and finally thirty-six yuan and six to seven jiao. Rice Broken fell from thirty-one yuan to thirty yuan and five jiao. The influx of imported rice continues, and most of the previously ordered rice will arrive before the end of the old lunar year. The prices of rice ordered from abroad are gradually falling. Yesterday, Jianyuan Trading Company sold 500 bags of Number Two Saigon to rice merchants at a further reduced price of five jiao, at forty-eight yuan and two jiao and a half. Negotiations for small-pattern broken rice are also ongoing.

More imported rice has arrived in Shanghai. Yesterday, Taikoo Company shipped 12,184 bags of rice from Qiongzhou in southern China to Shanghai via Hong Kong. The unloading was completed yesterday.

Thick Geng rice is still being manipulated by rice merchants, who are unwilling to sell it easily. Their only reason is that the quality of imported rice is far inferior to that of Geng rice. If Geng rice is still sold at the limited price, they will inevitably suffer a great loss. Although there are no market prices reported for high-quality Geng rice, this is because the prices are not made public, not because there is no stock. As long as you are willing to spend money, you can still trade it secretly. Buyers and sellers agree that to eat good rice, you must pay a high price, without issuing invoices (if an invoice is issued, the excess price is paid separately) and without recording it in the books (what is recorded is the limited price). If you want to buy rice at the limited price, you do not know what kind of rice you are buying. When used to cook rice, it is either undercooked or mushy. However, to buy Geng rice exceeding the limit, you must be familiar with the rice shop, for fear of revealing their secrets. Therefore, thick Geng rice is scarce in the market, all because it is not officially traded on the market, just to give it a touch of respectability. A small amount of Lisheng rice from Zhongguan is available, priced at forty yuan, and people are focusing on early and late rice. Since the selling price is cheaper than that of Geng rice and the quality is not inferior to that of Lisheng Geng rice, the demand for early rice is greater than usual. However, the general thin Geng rice market has met with setbacks. Qingsi thin rice is still forty yuan, Nangang early rice is thirty-nine yuan and seven to eight jiao, and Baiyuan's sales have slowed down. The Japanese do not want to hoard it, so the market has weakened, showing a slight half-yuan decline. The forty bags of Jiaxing Lujian that were transferred from the South City, due to their scarcity, were still priced at forty yuan and five jiao yesterday.

In the Wuxi rice market, the Japanese merchants have been buying up large quantities in the past few days, causing rice prices to soar. Now, the Wuxi Special Task Force needs to purchase 10,000 dan of white rice, each dan weighing 53 market catties, at a price of twenty-three yuan and five jiao. The rice millers will publicly allocate the rice through the rice merchants and deliver the goods on schedule. The Rice Association will charge a handling fee of one jiao per dan for winter relief. On the 26th, the Japanese military suddenly notified the Rice Industry Association that in the future, if Japanese merchants and resident Japanese merchants in Wuxi trade in the rice market, they must register and obtain permission from the Japanese military headquarters and the puppet county government before they are allowed to buy and sell, otherwise, they will be confiscated. The rice market tea parties on the 26th and 27th saw rice and paddy prices rebound by seven to eight jiao to one yuan and paddy prices rise by four to five jiao due to the scarcity of sources and the replenishment of stocks by factories and hoarders. High-quality white Geng rice opened at twenty-three yuan and two to three jiao per dan, especially high-quality coarse Geng rice at twenty-two yuan and two to three jiao, high-quality market rice at twenty-two yuan, Geng paddy at eleven yuan and three jiao to twelve yuan and two jiao, and glutinous rice and indica paddy also rose by three to five jiao. The current limited price of high-quality white Geng rice in the retail market is twenty-three yuan per dan. As the end of the old lunar year is approaching, it is rumored that the guerrillas in the surrounding areas are constantly intercepting rice merchants going to Wuxi to prevent them from selling rice to the Japanese, but some are released after paying a donation, indicating a distinction between the wise and the foolish.

### Securities: Domestic Debt Becomes More Consolidated

The unofficial securities market was very firm yesterday. There are rumors of a new loan between China and the United States, indicating that Sino-American cooperation is gradually becoming concrete. The war in eastern Zhejiang is showing signs of improvement. The ninth-term interest coupons will be paid as usual from the 31st. Some people in the market are buying interest coupons at a 95% discount, indicating that confidence is becoming more and more consolidated. Starting this afternoon, the market will start trading ex-dividend. The market will close after trading on Saturday morning this week and will resume normal trading on February 12th. Yesterday, trading gradually decreased, and sellers were holding on to their prices tightly. Lianhe Taifeng continued to sell at higher prices, while Hongda continued to buy. Xinfu, Jiufu, Tongyu, Hengfu, Shunli, and others bought from time to time. As a result, market prices improved slightly by one jiao to two jiao and a half. The total number of transactions was approximately 500,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:

Category   Highest   Lowest   Closing   Compared to Previous Day

Unified A   63.20   63.10   63.15   Up 0.20

Unified B   53.85   53.70   53.85   0.1

Unified C   51.25   51.05   51.15   0.25

Unified D   50.30   50.15   50.15   0.15

Unified E   51.05   50.95   50.95   0.20

Stock Trading: 30 shares of Shaolun Company were traded at a price of eight yuan and seven jiao, an increase of four jiao compared to the previous day.

Yesterday, the stock market of the Public Industry Association was particularly firm. Although the amount of transactions was not surprising, the buying behavior was good. Stocks that were usually loved by the public were again showered with favor. International Trust shares and Yangtze Bank shares both rose due to the good statistical value recently published. Yisong Ruirong shares and Gonghexing shares also experienced considerable gains. Buyers were still not satisfied at the closing. The stock price that rose the most was Xiangtai Timber Company shares, which opened at only forty-six yuan but closed with a transaction at fifty-one yuan. Industrial shares were so firm and rising, and rubber shares were also affected. All high-priced stocks made progress.

### Finance: Tianjin-Hong Kong Groups Active in Buying, Gold Market Rises Suddenly After Falling

The unofficial market for cash gold nuggets suddenly rose yesterday. In the afternoon, it was seen returning to over 4,100 yuan in Guanhai, because foreign exchange tightened and the Tianjin group was aggressively covering short positions. In addition, the Hong Kong group frequently came to buy, which also aroused the local retail investors to follow and search for advances. As a result, the amount returned increased by 29 yuan. However, it was quite sluggish in the early morning, falling by 25 yuan to open at a low price of 4,054 yuan, because foreign exchange was still loose, and the fund company was selling at a discount. Soon, foreign exchange returned to normal, and retail investors rushed to buy on the cheap. Furthermore, a certain securities group was aggressively covering short positions for the Tianjin group, and the Hong Kong group also entered. Before long, the price rose to 4,100 yuan. Later, due to frequent sales from the gold companies and silver houses, there was a slight pullback. In the end, due to the tightening of foreign exchange and aggressive buying by a certain silver house, the afternoon closing was still at 4,096 yuan. The trading was brisk throughout the day, about 2,500 taels. The price of gold jewelry in silver houses first fell, then returned to normal. The price of each customs gold was fixed.

Gold Nuggets Rise Sharply by Ninety-Nine Yuan

Since the opening of the exchange market in the morning, the atmosphere was listless. A certain gold company was the first to sell at a discount, opening 25 yuan lower, a certain gold company issuing securities group ten taels for 4,054 yuan. After a while, the price was cheap, and buyers suddenly flocked to buy, jumping 11 yuan. The securities group entered 20 taels to the money changers for 4,065 yuan. At this time, a certain gold company came to sell again, and the price was lowered to 4,060 yuan. Later, as foreign exchange returned to normal, retail investors' buying sentiment rose suddenly. A certain securities group frequently covered short positions for the Tianjin group, and at the same time, the Hong Kong group also commissioned a certain silver house and a certain money changer to buy on their behalf. Although silver houses and gold companies still had supply, the head position was still insufficient, so the price soared by 40 yuan. The securities group and the money changers entered 30 taels into the cash gold company for 4,100 yuan. After this, the buying sentiment subsided slightly, and another money changer took the opportunity to sell high, so it pulled back slightly to 4,085 yuan. At this time, a certain securities group again backfilled for the Tianjin group, rising to 4,099 yuan. Later, the money changers and silver house groups sold to each other, and the price pulled back 14 yuan, retreating to 4,085 yuan. In the end, due to the tight and weak foreign exchange, plus a certain silver house forcefully entered again, and the securities group continued to search for entries, it rose again by 12 yuan. A certain silver house entered 30 taels to the silver house group, for 4,096 yuan as the closing price. At the beginning of the afternoon, it was pressed down by 1 yuan, and a gold company issued ten taels to a silver house for 4,095 yuan. Afterwards, a certain silver house and a certain money changer and securities group, etc., successively bought on behalf of customers, and the foreign exchange continued to report tightly and weakly, and the suppliers were limited, so they leapt 27 yuan. The securities group entered ten taels to the money changers for 4,122 yuan. Subsequently, due to a lot of profit-taking being sold off, and a certain securities group also turned from entering to exiting, it pulled back by 20 yuan. The cash gold company sold ten taels to the money changers for 4,102 yuan. After entering, a certain gold company came to search for entries at the same time, and a certain money changer also had an appetite, and pulled up another 8 yuan. The gold company entered 20 taels to the securities group for 4,110 yuan. Subsequently, the securities group again resold 20 taels to the gold company for 4,108 yuan as the closing price for the evening. As a result, it rose 29 yuan compared to last Saturday, with a total of 68 yuan up and down throughout the day. The selling price of the cash gold company's own brand gold was several yuan higher than the gold nugget, and the purchase price was reduced by 20 yuan. The current bid gold is more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there is little trading.

It is Difficult to Reduce the Price of Jewelry Gold

The price of jewelry gold in silver houses is difficult to lower. In the beginning, the Datong Hang still suspended 40% and reduced by 5 yuan. At 10 o'clock, it returned to 5 yuan, and the result was flat. The Datong Hang still suspended 415 yuan. The New Hang's price was the same as the previous price, and the purchase price was reduced by about 15 yuan.

### Sassoon & Japanese Merchants: Close and Enter Foreign Exchange

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's listed prices did not fluctuate at all. The unofficial market for British and American exchange was first loose and then tight, and the result was slightly weaker. Throughout the day, the opening was flat, and then Chinese banks started to sell, and exporters followed suit. The price then increased to four and seventy-six five six two five and seven point nine three seven five. However, HSBC had a good appetite for the above-mentioned selling price, and other companies such as Lihua Bimo Hang also had buying intentions. Although speculators came to sell, they were all absorbed, and the market situation turned tighter. Therefore, before long, the foreign firms actively purchased forward contracts, and the Japanese banks and Sassoon also bought forcefully, suddenly tightening to four and sixty-eight seven five and seven point seven five. At noon, there was a slight shortage of purchasers, so the situation returned to slightly firmer. In the afternoon, Sassoon continued to buy, and Youli also entered. Furthermore, due to positive news, it tightened again to four and sixty-five six two five and seven point seven five. However, until the close, it returned to slightly flatter, at four and sixty-eight seven five and seven point seven eight two one five. As a result, it tightened by 0.046875 and 0.09375 compared to the end of last week. The potential of futures was the same as that of spot goods.

Chinese Merchants Initially Sell

In the early morning, the London big bar and the American Bank price were suspended and there was no telegram. The London gold price was fixed. The exchange rates for British, American, Shanghai, and French were all flat. American to British increased by 625, to French unchanged, to Shanghai by 8 points. The central listing prices for various currencies were as before. The banks' opening spot selling prices in the morning were British gold at four and seventy-three forty-three seventy-five and American exchange at seven yuan and eighty-seven five, and there were no changes compared to the end of last week. After opening, Chinese banks were the first to throw and sell, and exporters also came to spit it out, so the market situation gradually solidified. The Chinese banks sold to Youli February American exchange at seven yuan and seventy-five, and exporters sold to HSBC spot American exchange at seven yuan snowflake three seventy-five. At that time, the spot price of British gold also hardened to four and seventy-six five six two five. The HSBC listing announced no changes, and the silver balance tax announcement also had no increases or decreases. After this, although Chinese merchants and speculators came to sell, Huabi Bank, a certain bank, and other external firms had strong appetites, so the market situation turned softer. British gold had shrunk to four and seventy-one eighty-seven five, and American exchange was also softened to seven yuan and eighty-four three seventy-five. Before long, the foreign firms keenly came to purchase settlements, and Japanese banks, Zhengjin, and Western merchant Sassoon also reciprocally closed and entered, so the situation became more tense and soft. The foreign firms purchased from Youli a certain bank February American exchange at seven yuan and sixty-eight seventy-five and March American exchange at seven yuan and fifty-six two five. At the same time, Sassoon also settled and entered external firms' February British gold at four and sixty-five six two five. At the same time, the Japanese bank Zhengjin also purchased external firms' current Chinese-American exchange at seven yuan and eighty-one two five and seven eighty-one two five. The softest price was once shouted at four and sixty-eight seventy-five and seven yuan and seventy-seven. In the afternoon, the purchasers were satisfied, so the situation was slightly flatter. Until the closing, the banks' spot selling prices were British gold at four and seventy and thirty-one twenty-five and American exchange at seven yuan and eighty-one twenty-five, compared to the morning opening, British was tighter by 0.03125, and American was softer by 0.0625.

As a Result, Both British and American are Tight

In the afternoon, due to favorable rumors and Sassoon continuing to purchase settlements, coupled with Youli's appetite remaining good, the market situation continued to soften. Youli ate Chinese banks' spot American exchange at seven yuan and eighty-one twenty-five, and also included internal firm's February American exchange at seven yuan and sixty-five sixty-two five. At that time, Sassoon also settled and entered external firms' spot American exchange at seven yuan and seventy-eight twelve five and seventy-five. At that time, current first order was also softened to four and sixty-five sixty-two five. After entering, the external firm's willingness to supply was slightly strong, and purchasers gradually lacked, so the situation returned to a slightly flatter state. Until the late closing, the banks' spot selling prices were British gold at four and sixty-eight seventy-five and American exchange at seven yuan and seventy-eight twelve five, next month's period British gold at four and sixty-four 0 six two five and American exchange at seven yuan and sixty-five sixty-two five. As a result, compared to the end of last week, the current period British were both tighter by 0.046875, and American were both softer by 0.09375.

### Foreign Currencies Unanimously Become Firm

Yesterday, foreign currencies continued to become more and more firm and strong. There was a resurgence in demand for British and American gold pounds, and the market price was slightly better. British and American gold notes first loosened and then tightened. The supply of American gold notes was quite smooth in the early morning, and the market price was weak, falling to twelve yuan, five jiao, and two fen. Afterwards, customers turned from selling to buying, and the market price became increasingly expensive, rising to twelve yuan, seven jiao, and one fen in the evening market. The supply of Hong Kong notes was scarce, and the market price was slightly firm. Canadian and Philippine notes also followed suit and rose. Japanese gold notes were slightly loose and weak, with the evening market price at one yuan, two jiao, five fen, and nine li.

### Yarn & Cotton: Cotton Yarn Bulls Very Strong in Pulling Power

The yarn market was calm and without features, but those with more generous financial resources had bullish thoughts and were still keen on seeing the market rise. Therefore, they constantly scouted in the market. Thus, even though actual demand was not showing large-scale expansion, people's hearts were still very upright, and the platform was tight. Given this situation, it is deeply expected that the market will be pulled higher over the New Year. However, given that the situation of American cotton is declining, and the falling wind of Indian cotton is remarkably intense, the calculated price is cheaper than domestic cotton. The factory side's costs are easing by the day. If actual sales are delayed in the coming spring, the market may move, which is also unknown.

At the opening of spot yarn in the morning, the atmosphere was good. Most were in a bull position, and shouts were very high, but buyers were few. The opening price of 20-count doubled yarn was 738 yuan, and there was not much difference from the previous day's price, but the futures situation was seen to be indolent. Soon it was heard that the foreign exchange opening did not have large changes, and fell slightly by one or two yuan. Until the closing, it was still ordinary. The half-day trading statistics checked were 990 packages, and the market conditions for two branches of the double horse were the same as the previous day's price, with no changes at all. The factory side opened 280 packages of 20-count special Jincheng from Yong'an Factory, the price was 732 yuan, 200 packages of 10-count special Jincheng, the price was 590 yuan, Zhenhua Factory opened 75 packages of 10-count Double Dragon, the price was 547 yuan. Today, 435 pieces of exported cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong. The amount bought by various gangs is listed below:

Fellow merchants 695 Hong Kong 190

Inland 105 Statistics 990

### After Indian Cotton Fell Sharply for Days, Purchase Intentions Gradually Moved in the Industry

Cotton trading has completely stalled, because the end of the year is approaching, and everyone is preparing to settle accounts, and there is no time to operate, so it has completely stopped. In addition, the overseas Indian and American cotton markets have fallen in unison recently, and the falling wind is particularly intense. From this situation, the import of foreign cotton in the future will inevitably come in a steady stream. 1,064 packages of Subai cotton arrived in Tonghua, and 1,017 other packages from Changyinsha. Today, 120 packages of cotton are being shipped to Hong Kong. The current cotton transaction situation is listed on the left.

Mitelin 225.00 Fuchengxin 400 packages

Mitelin 228.00 Fuchengxin 500 packages

Stott Mitelin 220.00 Fellow merchants enter 100 packages

Another message: Foreign cotton market price, New York cotton market, fell in the early morning yesterday due to pressure from sellers and telegrams of declines from Mumbai. Later, the market turned slightly firmer due to purchases by the industry and coverage by some short sellers. As a result, closing prices were quite different. The recent period fell by one pound sound, and the distant period rose by two pound sound. India, including forecasts, fell by three rupees, Egypt fell by more than ten pound sounds, Liverpool closed.

Shanghai foreign cotton trading: Spot trading has been very dull in recent days, and recently, due to the sharp decline in Indian cotton, there is a great deal of interest in purchasing Indian cotton among peers. There were slight transactions yesterday, all for ships to be loaded in February and March, and the price was cheaper than that of the Dazhong Collection. The factory side was quiet, as were Japanese manufacturers. The foreign cotton market prices yesterday, converted to no-machine matter sent to the factory at an American exchange rate of 7.75, are as follows:

20-count American Mitelin 234.00

20-count also Lower grade 230.40

32-count also 241.80

32-count also Lower grade 236.50

42-count also 145.30

42-count also Lower grade 141.50

### Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Thoughts Easy to Exchange, and Moving Again

The cloth market trend is firm and rising, because factory prices are rising step by step due to cost reasons, and trading ideas are moving again. Overseas Guangdong, Yunnan, and Tianjin gangs are now actively guaranteeing goods, and selling prices are outstanding. However, the Yongshao gang is cheap selling various goods, resulting in uneven market prices. Fugui Dapeng fine cloth rebounded, and coarse cloth and wool rose by 3-5 jiao per piece. Yihuo and Lun Chang's various goods were flat. Guangdong and Yunnan gangs handled more than 200 pieces of Xinshen fine cloth, twill cloth, various factory-colored cloths, colored twill, serge, wool, and spring clothing, poplin, standard cloth. The Tianjin gang handled nearly 200 pieces of blue cloth, poplin, and khaki cloth. Over 500 pieces of gray cloth and dyed, bleached cloths were traded in the market. Overseas Nanyang gangs handled tens of thousands of pieces of bleached cloth, colored cloth, colored twill, and printed cloth.

The rising trend of Eastern cloth continued strongly, because the trading by locals was prosperous. Fine cloth rose again by 2 jiao to 2 jiao and a half per piece, and fine twill rose by 1 jiao to 1 jiao and a half. The current market price of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth is 22 yuan, 9 jiao, and a half. Fine twill is 22 yuan, 1 jiao, and a half. The price of Four Gentlemen serge is 7 jiao and 5 li per yard. Various foreign firms have ordered nearly a thousand pieces of Dragon Head brand fine cloth in futures, and four or five hundred pieces of other mid- and low-grade brands. The opening prices are as follows:

February March

12-pound Dragon Head 23.50 23.85 Fine Cloth to 24.00

12-pound Yanghe Also 22.40 23.80

12-pound Color Ball Also 23.35 23.

Exported cloth: Today (30th), there are 440 pieces going to Hong Kong, and 1,068 pieces going to Tianjin.

### Silk and Tea: Shanghai Silk Unlikely to Improve by the End of the Lunar Year

Yesterday, the Yokohama silk market continued its sharp decline. Spot prices were 1800 yuan, down 80 yuan, a drop of 580 yuan from the beginning of the month. Near-term futures were 1799 yuan, down 100 yuan from last Saturday. Long-term futures were 1744 yuan, up 24 yuan. New York markets were closed yesterday. The Shanghai silk market was quiet, and it is predicted that the Shanghai silk market will unlikely improve before the Lunar New Year. This is because most silk merchants have their year-end settlements coming up and have made considerable profits. Because they don't have many goods on hand, they don't need to rush to sell them off. Yesterday, there were no transactions from British, French, or Indian firms.

### Grains: Soybean Speculators Inquire

Yesterday, trading volume was large in the miscellaneous grains market, but actual sales were stagnant. Only speculators were inquiring. Transactions included 500 bags of Kaifeng soybeans at prices ranging from 10 yuan 2 jiao to 22 yuan 5 jiao, 130 bags of Wuhu soybeans at 21 yuan 3 jiao, one cartload of Nanjing soybeans at 20 yuan 4 jiao, 80 bags of Songjiang soybeans at 13 yuan 7 jiao, and 86 bags of Jiangbei green soybeans at 18 yuan 1 jiao. The market is already in a winding-down state, so there are no changes. We must wait for the red market after the Lunar New Year.

In addition, 2240 bags of raw peanuts arrived in Shanghai, having been shipped from Qingdao yesterday. Today (the 30th), 4825 bags of soybeans and 2425 bags of raw peanuts are being shipped to Hong Kong.

### Coal: Abundant Charcoal Arrivals Lead to Price Weakening

Since the emergency in eastern Zhejiang, the charcoal market has seen increasing public anxiety and a sudden surge in sales, suggesting an upward trend. However, due to the abundant arrivals in Shanghai, including large shipments of Haimen and Huangyan charcoal arriving on the Malheur Wheel, totaling over 5,000 dan, and being unloaded at Yangjingbang, prices were quoted at 8 yuan 4 jiao per dan for large baskets with flat lids, and 7 yuan 8 jiao for Meixi green charcoal, with additional charges for dockside trucking.

### Sugar Market: Slightly Softer Coarse White Sugar

Yesterday, the sugar market trend was flat. The guild's listed price for spot 24 coarse white sugar at the local warehouse remained unchanged at 58 yuan. Newly arrived goods at other warehouses were 58 yuan 3 jiao, down a small 2 jiao, while old stock was 57 yuan 6 jiao, down a small 4 jiao. Transshipment goods remained at 46 yuan.

Local cotton white sugar No. 1 from Zhenji was 58 yuan. Local rock sugar remained unchanged. Government-controlled sugar prices remained the same, with few transactions.

### North and South Goods: Shortage of Lower-Grade Longans

Recent arrivals of Guiren longans have been scarce, particularly for lower-grade goods, leading to a perceived shortage. Yesterday, the listed price for old longan meat stored at the firm was 105 yuan, with relatively good quality. Prices for slightly looser goods are down, but better-quality old goods from firms require 120 yuan to 115 yuan.

### Seafood: Pepper Down 2 Yuan

Pepper sales have been slow recently, leading to a weakening market and a drop of 2 yuan from previous prices. Yesterday, black pepper (large) opened at 88 yuan, No. 1 black pepper at 90 yuan, Wenchang white pepper at 153 yuan, and Dutch white pepper at 145 yuan.

### The Story of a Young Master

— Xiao Yu

Confucius said: Food and sex are human nature. Do you think there is anyone in the world who doesn't like "women"?

Let's talk about the time when the August 13th Incident first started. A young man lived in the center of Jiangwan, which was often in danger and took the brunt of the attacks. He immediately moved into the French Concession with his widowed mother and younger brother. Although the sound of airplanes fighting and cannons booming could be heard every day, the protection of the foreigners kept them safe and sound. After three months, the war shifted westward, and Shanghai became an isolated island. The frivolousness on this isolated island was indeed something to behold. Men and women were still intoxicated by this man-made creation.

So dance halls and theaters reopened, and business was booming, surpassing normal years. This young master also occasionally entered the singing and dancing halls, enjoying himself. As if drawn by magic, he lingered and forgot to return, and became acquainted with a girl from the South. This girl also came from a scholarly family, but was forced by circumstances to become a "flexible girl." The two of them were deeply in love, proving Confucius's ancient saying that "I have never seen anyone who loves virtue as much as he loves beauty." However, good flowers do not bloom forever. The family's income gradually became insufficient, and the old mother gradually found out. From then on, the young master's finances became strained, while the "flexible girl" and her family of three were crying out for food. Since you can't take responsibility, eating is important to me. So she reconnected with a comprador master, and left the young master aside, which was very sad. He was unwilling to give up and continued to pester the "flexible girl," but she was so annoyed that she asked the head of the band to teach him a lesson. One night, after the young master finished dancing and returned home, several burly men suddenly jumped out and shouted, "Be sensible!" The young master was young and competitive and refused to bow his head, so he was beaten severely, leaving him with a black eye, swollen face, and covered in bruises. He also encountered an outbreak of typhoid fever and became seriously ill, going to the Ten Kings of Hell to complain.

I, the reporter Xiao Yu, witnessed this scene and was deeply saddened. I wrote this article to warn you all to be careful. As the saying goes, "Mountains of gold and silver cannot fill the debt of the pleasure quarter." We are all in the same boat, so don't linger in the gentle land and strive for a better future.

Family

### Broken Heart

— Qiu Jiecai

This morning, after finishing the "graduation photo" at the school, I received the "graduation certificate" and "transcript" and walked out of the school gate. I felt as if my heart was being stabbed by ten thousand knives at the same time. Thinking that after graduation, "further education" was out of the question, then all that was left was "employment," but where could I find a job? Stay at home and idle about? Rice costs thirty to forty yuan per dan, and my father doesn't have a job, so where will the money come from for me to do that? Thinking of my parents weeping together in their ragged clothes the night before, I couldn't help but shed two tears.

Walking home, I climbed the small bamboo ladder into the dark and dirty attic and saw my mother mending my father's trousers. I sat down, and my mother frowned and said to me: "The landlord is raising the rent by two yuan... Alas! What should I do?... We only have enough rice for two days..."

The faint light shining from the skylight onto my mother's worried face, she was so thin, the wrinkles on her forehead running in all directions, so many that you couldn't count them all. I asked: "Where is father?" "He heard that there were rice riots outside, so he went out there." Mother answered me like this. "What? What did father go out there to do? Does he want to riot for rice too?" My broken heart was thinking like this.

Education

### A Day of Education

— Zeng Zhen

I am a student, so I can only talk about the various forms and styles in school. Please enjoy this distorted picture!

At 8:00 in the morning, the teacher, with a sleepy look in her eyes, walks into the classroom. Less than half of the students are present. As usual, she reviews the lesson for half an hour.

At 9:00, the boys and girls have a talk class. There is no end to the topics they talk about: some talk about the movie they saw last night, some talk about today's entertainment, some talk about clothes, some talk about hairstyles, and some are talking about love. The English teacher is impersonating a Japanese play, singing and acting herself.

The third class is physics. Today, Teacher Zhang decided to expand the scope. Mr. Zhang first bargained for one hundred "matchsticks," and finally agreed to a 50% discount.

The last class is with the newly arrived teacher, Mr. Chen. Yesterday, the class passed a resolution to have the class leader negotiate with him today, asking him to retire voluntarily; otherwise, they would deal with him effectively, because his teaching method was inappropriate.

In the afternoon, as usual, is leisure time, and various activities begin. Some go to the movie theater to acquire foreign scientific and artistic knowledge, some go to the dance hall to adapt to the needs of the new era and cultivate social skills, some go to the handball court to relieve mental fatigue, and some go to tea rooms and parks to chat and increase friendship among classmates.

The teachers devote themselves to playing mahjong every day, partly to study wartime trends and partly to train their thinking abilities in order to improve the effectiveness of education. The director of studies provides all incidental expenses during mahjong time.

At 5:00 or 6:00, all the students go out of the school for a walk. Boys and girls walking hand in hand is a required course every day. Therefore, there is no lack of people who succeed in love.

A day's work flies by like this. Today is like this, tomorrow is like this, and the day after tomorrow is also like this. Is life in an isolated island's school always like this?

### Living by Selling Blood

— Zhu Xun

The prosperity of Shanghai's surface cannot hide the deep pain: the recent situation of providing relief on Datong Road, as well as the crowded tragedy at Pingyuan in the past, are enough to show the inner layer of Shanghai.

A relative of mine has been unemployed for a long time, and his family has no way to live. He had to be introduced by a friend to a certain hospital as a blood donor, to supply the hospital when patients have insufficient blood, in order to earn some considerable compensation.

I sadly persuaded him not to do this cruel job of selling blood, because everyone knows that blood is the most precious and unique component of life, and it is undoubtedly the most miserable to sell precious blood in order to live. Who knew that he would reply: "...Yes, I sell blood, and you think it's cruel; in fact, aren't you also selling blood in the same way? A large group of people on the isolated island are living by selling blood. They work like cattle and horses all day long, and sometimes the compensation they get cannot even solve their own lives; so you don't have to pity me for selling blood, aren't you the same as me? The only difference is that you are selling your blood invisibly, and I am just more obvious..."

Local Customs

### Paper House

— Jing Xing

Who would believe that there would be a house in Shanghai that uses thick paper as tiles?

This house was originally just a single-family two-story building. The owner was a shrewd profit-seeker who knew how to make money. He occupied the common sun deck used by the tenants and built an attic to rent out for profit. However, the profit-hungry owner, not satisfied with his greed, engaged in intrigue and actually built another attic on top of the sun deck attic, renting it out to make money. Thus, a single-family two-story building was transformed into a four-story "high-rise building."

The owner really put a lot of effort into the building materials for this "high-rise building." It was made of thin wooden boards. What is most surprising is that the roof of this "high-rise building" is only covered with a thin board, topped with a sheet of thick paper. It relies on this paper to ward off wind and rain, which is truly amazing!

Three months ago, a hurricane struck Shanghai. Although this "high-rise building" was spared from collapsing, the structure was damaged. As for the thick paper used as tiles, it was soaked through and blown away by the hurricane.

After the hurricane, the owner rebuilt and hired workers to repair it. Today, there is still such a "high-rise building" on the north bank of the Suzhou River.

### Old Newspapers Put to New Use

— Ou Kaizuo

"The newspaper I covered myself with last night got wet from the rain and snow. Can you lend me a dry one?"

### Shanghai is Like a Rose

— Meng Shu

Shanghai is like a rose, beautifully adorable, but under the green leaves are thorns everywhere.

The more flowers there are, the more thorns there are. With one more flower, I don't know how many thorns are added below.

The sky is gloomy, it's raining, and the roses grow especially beautifully.

The blood stains on the flower picker's hands are as red as the roses placed in the vase! Dropping drop by drop on the ground, it's hard to tell if it's rain, tears, or blood?

Vaguely, he can hear the laughter of the appreciators.

Shanghai is like a rose, no! Such Shanghai, Shanghai is like a thorn!

### Elected Movie Emperor and Empress of 1940: Mickey Rooney and Bette Davis

— Qiu Wen

New York newspapers held an election for the 1940 Movie Emperor and Empress at the end of last year, based on free voting by readers of each newspaper. The results showed that the child star Mickey Rooney and Bette Davis, who has won the Film Art and Science Award for many years, received the most votes. Thus, they won the throne of this year's Emperor and Empress.

Mickey Rooney was born in Schenatsey Town, USA in July 1924. Because his father, Joe Yule, was a famous actor, Mickey started performing with his father in theaters at the age of eleven. It was not until 1936, when his family moved to Hollywood, that he was introduced by a friend of his father's to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to serve as a supporting role for child stars. His first debut was "A Midsummer Night's Dream," but at that time, he only played an insignificant child prodigy. It was not until the public screening of "Captains Courageous" and "A Family Affair" in the winter of 1937 that Mickey gradually attracted the attention of movie fans around the world, and his reputation also increased day by day.

He is only seventeen years old this year, but his acting skills are extremely excellent, with the talent of a mischievous child. In the past, in "Love Finds Andy Hardy" and "Andy Hardy Gets Spring Fever," he played a superficial and frivolous young man who was not deeply involved in the world, and eventually involuntarily became deeply involved in a racy atmosphere. Thus, all kinds of different humorous jokes unfolded like a string of beads. He can describe every action and every line in a meticulous way. Secondly, he can also recognize the personality of each character in the play, so the great director Ernst Lubitsch praised him as "Hollywood's unique child star."

In "Strike Up the Band," which premiered at the Dahua Theater a month ago, although the role he played has changed from his consistent style in the past, it still does not get rid of the comedic style. Bette Davis gave up her singing and dancing career in the spring of 1934 and joined Warner Brothers Company. At that time, she only earned a weekly salary of sixty-five US dollars, but with her continuous efforts, she finally won the trust of the director and was invited to star in "Of Human Bondage," which was another success. Then, she completed a "Dangerous," which was another unexpected success. In 1936, she was hailed as one of the best actresses, and she won the gold medal of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. At the same time, Warner Company also awarded her ten thousand US dollars, but she was not proud of this. She still worked hard, and on average, she could star in eight new films a year. Her most recent films include "The Great Lie" and "The Letter," which will be able to meet us soon.

She is already twenty-five years old today, and she married the musician Harmon Nelson at the age of twenty-one, but she has not yet given birth to a child. Perhaps it is because of this reason that she still reveals the beauty of a naive virgin on the screen. Their family is in Warner Village, which was built by Warner Company itself. She still does the work of washing clothes and cooking herself. Therefore, when filming "It All Came True" the year before, because there was a giant snake in the play to perform with her, she immediately and firmly refused the company after she got the news. Although she felt that the role in "It All Came True" was very suitable for her personality, she finally did not dare to make a bold attempt because of the fear of snakes.

Xinhua Company's new film "Qin Liangyu" is scheduled to premiere at the Guangda Theater in Shanghai during the Lunar New Year. This film takes the glorious deeds of the Miao people on the southwestern border who exerted their efforts for the country as the theme. It is generous and tragic, worthy of praise, and contains profound significance. The company used all its strength to shoot it, and it is expected to cause a sensation. New

### Celebrity Statues for Future Generations to Study

The New York World's Fair, in order to leave a permanent memorial to the civilization of mankind in the twentieth century, specially invited racial experts and artists to select the most typical female figure of the era from the female stars in Hollywood, cast a statue according to her form, and mark the typical female figure of 1940. Then, it will be buried in the mountains near the venue, and a monument will be erected, so that humans can dig it up five thousand years later and compare it with the women of that time to see what differences there are.

The result of the association's selection was unanimous in recommending the big-eyed Joan Blondell, because her muscles and body shape are the most typical of women of the era. Miss Joan was extremely excited when she received this news and paid special attention to her daily life. She also hired a famous doctor to guide her at any time so that her body would be healthier.

Liu Gansan's Two Donkeys Escorting the Funeral

Liu's portrait is "Visiting Relatives," and the donkey he loved throughout his life was also painted in it. Gansan rides on the back of the donkey, with a smiling face and a long bun, resembling an old woman from Sanhe County. At that time, photography was not yet popular in the old capital, so the hall used this portrait to attract customers. After photography became popular, there were not many skilled portraitists, and the thirteen long-hanging portraits of the Thirteen Unique Talents were gradually bought by people. (Some say that they have flowed overseas.) After Gansan passed away, his family ordered craftsmen to make a paper donkey according to the shape, color, height, and size of the donkey. There were wheels under the hooves, which could be pushed by people. On the day of Liu's funeral, two donkeys, one real and one fake, walked side by side in front of the coffin, and the onlookers along the way were like walls. After the burial was completed, the paper donkey was burned to show the meaning of using his beloved object as a burial object. Gansan's brother, Gansi, led the real donkey back to feed it, but the donkey actually did not eat or drink all day long, and died in a few days to follow its master. Even donkeys and horses can know loyalty and repay their masters, which is much higher than today's people.

The author has seen three kinds of Liu's posthumous portraits. In addition to "Visiting Relatives," there is also the "Si Zhicheng" portrait. Liu played an old madam. This picture was published in the author's book "History of Chinese Drama." In addition, "Neon Shadows," published by Zhonghua Printing House in Beiping in 1923, contains a photo of Liu and Xiao Fucai in "Picking Up a Jade Bracelet." He played the matchmaker Liu, holding a hookah in his left hand and a "paper blower" in his right hand. However, this picture was a photo taken in his later years. The appearance and expression are exactly the same as the two portraits, which proves the precision of our country's portrait technology in the past. (179)
