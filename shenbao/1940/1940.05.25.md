### The Successful Encirclement Tactics of the Chinese Army in Northern Hubei; Remnants of the Japanese Army Retreat to the Northwestern Suburbs of Zaoyang; Main Force of the Japanese Army Completely Withdraws from the North Bank of the Baihe River; Chinese Army in Southern Henan Besieges Zhongshanpu and Recovers Chenlou

Chongqing A certain military spokesperson told a Central News Agency reporter that the Japanese army near Zaoyang, after being defeated by the Chinese army a few days ago, retreated in two routes. On the 18th, the majority retreated to the area north of the Xiang-Hua Road, and a small portion retreated to the area south of the Xiang-Hua Road. Chinese blocking troops intercepted the retreating Japanese in the areas of Suiyangdian and Wujiadian on the same day, preventing them from fleeing back. On the 19th, over ten thousand Japanese soldiers reinforced Zaoyang along the southern side of the Xiang-Hua Road, joining the remnants of the Japanese army that had failed to withdraw from Zaoyang, and began a counterattack. After discovering the Japanese situation, the various Chinese pursuit units implemented a plan to encircle and annihilate the Japanese again with extremely ingenious tactics. The battle progressed until the morning of the 10th, with the Japanese restoring their position on May 17th, that is, the area from Longxingzhen to Taipingzhen. Starting on the 21st, the Chinese troops confronting the Japanese at Taipingzhen shifted eastward according to plan, outflanking the Japanese rear. The Chinese troops confronting the Japanese at Longxingzhen shifted southward, cutting off the Japanese retreat route. At the same time, the Chinese frontal troops actively advanced toward the flanks of the Japanese army, implementing containment maneuvers to complete the large encirclement posture. That night, the Chinese troops on all fronts prepared for a new attack. At this time, the Japanese still advanced rashly. By the morning of the 22nd, the Japanese had reached the area of Jianhezhen and Lüyanzhen. Starting that afternoon, the Chinese launched a full-scale encirclement. After a day and night of bloody battle, the Chinese army was irresistible and completely crushed the Japanese army. The Japanese suffered extremely heavy losses in their southern defeat. By noon on the 23rd, the remnants of the Japanese army had retreated to the northwestern suburbs of Zaoyang, restoring their position after the defeat on the 16th, and the situation became even more dire. The Chinese encirclement units are now fiercely annihilating the remnants of the Japanese army. (24th Dispatch)

Fancheng The Chinese armies of Southern Henan and Northern Hubei completed a large-scale counter-encirclement against the counter-attacking Japanese on the 22nd. Taking advantage of the Japanese entering an area crisscrossed by rivers, they immediately launched an encirclement from all sides. The main force that broke through the Tanghe and Baihe Rivers was completely defeated by the Chinese army again on the 23rd, and retreated to the vicinity of Zaoyang again. Currently, the Japanese army's deep rear areas have gradually come under the firm control of the Chinese army, and there is no possibility of escape. At the same time, the Chinese army, converging from all directions, entered the Japanese rear and, according to the pre-determined plan, will first annihilate the newly reinforced Japanese troops in the southern section of the Xiang-Hua Road and the area north of the Han-Yi Road, in order to quickly complete the entire Chinese battle plan.

Luoyang The Japanese who retreated from Northern Hubei forcibly crossed the Baihe River to harass the area starting on the 20th. The Chinese army waited in strict formation on one side to intercept the Japanese army, and at the same time adopted a large-scale encirclement strategy, detouring to the Japanese flanks, attacking from both sides. The Japanese initially used many tanks to charge, but they became trapped in the river swamp area and could not move. At Lüyanzhen, northeast of the city, the Chinese army saw that the counter-encirclement network had been completed. On the 22nd, after a day of fierce fighting, the Japanese suffered heavy casualties and retreated completely along the entire front.

### From the Problem of Coffining the Dead in Shexian to Cremation

Since maritime transport of timber from Zhejiang and Fujian has been cut off, and the source is not sustainable, the price of pine and willow planks has risen five or six times higher than the market price before the war; a wooden plank measuring fifteen feet is valued ten times its original price, making it difficult for those engaged in the benevolent act of providing coffins and burials to bear the heavy burden.

There are many organizations in Shanghai that provide coffins and burial services. Among those that provide both coffins and burials, the most prominent are the Tongren Fuyuantang and the Pushan Villa. In the last three years, the Pushan Villa has buried more than 152,000 corpses of all sizes and provided more than 21,000 large coffins. The Tongren Fuyuantang has buried more than 75,000 corpses of all sizes and provided more than 11,000 large coffins. Many small coffins are not included in the count. Since all of these are board coffins, and the price of board has increased five or six times, the expenditure on this item will also be five or six times greater than before. As for the coffins sold on the market, those that used to cost dozens of dollars now cost hundreds of dollars. Alas, in today's world, the means to support life and bury the dead are difficult to secure.

Confucianism values benevolence and filial piety and cannot bear to see the bodies of one's relatives exposed, so they are gathered and buried. As Mencius said, "The filial son and benevolent man must have a way to bury his parents." Extending the heart of love for one's relatives to all of humankind, collecting unclaimed corpses, and burying exposed bones are acts of compassion that arise from human nature. It is to practice a little benevolence with a heart that cannot bear to see the suffering of others, and thus the system of public cemeteries and charitable burial grounds has spread to the common people.

Mozi cherished material resources and advocated frugality in funerals, saying that "Confucians advocate extravagant burials and prolonged mourning, make heavy coffins and outer coffins, and provide many clothes and quilts. Treating death as a migration, three years of weeping is enough to ruin the world." Zhuangzi said, "Mozi did not sing in life, nor did he wear mourning clothes in death. He used a three-inch paulownia coffin without an outer coffin." When a follower of Mozi buried his parents lavishly, Mencius criticized him, saying, "This is to serve one's parents with what one despises." However, even in Confucianism, extravagant burials were not always considered acceptable. Therefore, when his disciples wanted to bury Yan Hui lavishly, Confucius did not allow it. The meaning of burial is to conceal. Regardless of whether the burial is lavish or frugal, it is better to enter the earth and rest in peace and decay quickly. It should not be allowed to accumulate bones in the fields, spreading filth and harming public health. This is in accordance with the main purpose of gathering and burying the dead.

Therefore, some people today advocate restoring the practice of cremation. The system of cremation originated from the Buddhist practice of cremation, entered China with Buddhism, and flourished in the Six Dynasties, Tang, and Song dynasties. In the Southern Song dynasty, with the rise of Neo-Confucianism, people said, "The customs of the people are such that they provide lavishly for the living but burn and discard the dead. Why are they kind to the living but unkind to the dead? Some even burn them and place them in the water, which knowledgeable people find disturbing." Therefore, they requested that cremation be prohibited. However, at that time, it was also considered that "poor families can only simplify the means of burial, and they often resort to cremation as a convenience. This has become a common practice that is difficult to change quickly, so it should be left to the convenience of the people," which shows that cremation was convenient for poor families. During the Yuan dynasty, which revered Buddhism, cremation flourished again. When Hongwu ascended the throne, he strictly prohibited cremation, and the custom was reformed during the Qing dynasty. Now, cremation is considered unacceptable. If one wishes to restore cremation, some will surely criticize it as cruel and unkind, or even misunderstand it as imitating Japan. In fact, Japanese culture and customs mostly imitate China. The system of cremation was also transmitted from China with Buddhism. Due to the limited land and dense population of the Japanese archipelago, cremation is suitable for their national conditions and has become prevalent!

The rainy season is approaching, and the heat and humidity are easily subject to change. With Shanghai's dense population, high prices, displaced people everywhere, and corpses lying on the roads, it is extremely difficult to collect and bury the dead. Therefore, the practice of cremation can be considered a temporary expedient. If there are those who cherish the idea of providing for the dry bones of the dead and consider cremation unacceptable, then they should generously open their purses and prepare ample timber, not just paying lip service, but actually helping those who provide coffins and burial services. Only then would it be acceptable.

### Allied Forces of One Million Attempt to Break Through; A Battle Occurs in the Cambrai Area; The Extended Front Line Reaches One Hundred Miles, Unprecedented in Scale; Boulogne Falls Yesterday, British Troops Withdraw Completely

London The intense battle in northern France has now unfolded along a hundred-mile-long front line, the scale of which is incomparable to the First World War. It is reported that the troops of Britain, France, and Belgium are exerting all their efforts to attack the German army along the hundred-mile front line, starting from the coastal city of Boulogne in western France, southeast to the town of Cambrai. Both sides are using all the powerful weapons of modern mechanized warfare. The fate of millions of Allied soldiers may depend on this battle. (International News Agency, 24th)

Paris The High Command announced today that the Allied forces in northern France have reached the outskirts of Cambrai, only thirty-five miles from the main French forces. (International News Agency, 24th)

Paris Today, a spokesman for the French Army stated that the fighting in Flanders is still raging. Details of the current battle situation are difficult to obtain. Therefore, General Weygand, the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces at this stage, finds it necessary not to release any information. However, it can be determined that the battle situation is extremely fierce, especially in the area between Arras, Cambrai, and Valenciennes. (Reuters, 24th)

Paris The French General Headquarters issued a war report in the morning stating that the enemy forces in the north are currently trying to increase pressure. The French positions on the Somme River line are very strong. The enemy has launched another fierce attack south of the city of Colour, but there has been no significant progress. (Havas, 24th)

London It is heard from responsible sources here that German troops occupied Boulogne last night. British troops there have actually withdrawn completely. (Reuters, 24th)

German Front Line According to reliable German officers, the rapidly advancing German troops have almost completely trapped the British Expeditionary Force in a German pocket. The Allied forces have a total of twenty-three divisions, totaling about 500,000 men. As a result of the fierce German attack, the area near the coast close to Abbeville has been surrounded by the Germans in a pocket. The officers also pointed out that the Allied forces surrounded by the German army and facing danger include five Belgian divisions, several French divisions, and almost all of the British army. (United Press, 28th)

Berlin The German war report announced last night that the German troops are advancing rapidly towards the English Channel, and the occupation of the French port of Boulogne is the prelude to the annihilation of one million besieged Allied soldiers in Belgium. German military circles said that the annihilation of the Belgian Allied forces would determine the outcome of the continental campaign, and Germany would therefore be able to promote its land war to the British Isles. One million British, French, and Belgian troops are surrounded by German armored vehicle troops, and their annihilation or surrender is inevitable. The Allied forces will no longer be able to field such a strong force in continental Europe after this defeat. France will also be unable to withdraw its troops stationed at the Maginot Line to defend the capital, Paris. They also said that because of Italy's attitude towards the European war, France will not be able to mobilize its troops stationed in Savoy. After the defeat of the Allied forces in continental Europe, the troops of the Third Reich will begin to use the Franco-Belgian ports on the English Channel as a base to conquer the British Isles. The ports of Abbeville, Calais, Dunkirk, and Boulogne will all be used as bases for attacking Britain. The fall of Boulogne means that the occupation of Calais is imminent. Boulogne is only eighteen miles from Calais, and Calais is only twenty-six miles from Dover on the opposite British coast. Boulogne and Dover are also only twenty-eight miles apart. German military circles also said that once the German army occupies Boulogne and Calais, it will use artillery to bombard Dover, Folkestone, and other important coastal cities in Britain, making it impossible for Britain's coastal defense line to defend. At the same time, German aircraft can continuously bomb important British military bases. (United Press, 24th)

Berlin The German military bulletin stated that the battle of Valenciennes is underway. The remnants of the French and Belgian forces are surrounded and are struggling for their lives. The area occupied by the enemy is gradually shrinking under the threat of the power of the German air force and army. German military personnel compared the battle situation in Valenciennes with the Battle of Kutno involving the Polish army last year, believing that the French and Belgian forces today are stronger than the Polish army. In the Battle of Kutno, the 14th Polish Army was completely destroyed by the German army. Today, it has not been possible to completely eliminate the French and Belgian forces in five days. The equipment of the French and Belgian forces is also stronger than that of the Polish army. If the enemy is not surrounded, it will be difficult to completely eliminate the enemy's stubborn resistance for a while. (Haitong, 24th)

### English Channel Skies　Large Numbers of German Aircraft Spotted　Paris Air Raid Alert Yesterday Morning

London　The British Air Ministry announced last night that an air raid alert was issued in the East Kent area yesterday evening. After an air raid warden in a certain town sounded the siren, the roads were quickly cleared, and not a soul was to be seen. Only a few British aircraft soared in the sky, but no enemy aircraft were seen after twenty minutes. At the same time, an alert was issued in another town in East Kent, and within minutes about twenty British aircraft were circling in the air. The artillery did not open fire. Large numbers of aircraft were seen over the English Channel yesterday. Some people saw these aircraft being bombarded by anti-aircraft guns from cliffs along the coast, and the anti-aircraft fire appeared to be coming from the French coast. It is believed that one aircraft was shot down. (Reuters dispatch on the 24th)

Paris　At 10:15 this morning, anti-aircraft positions around Paris opened fire. Occasionally, black smoke and exploding bullets could be seen in the sky over the city. Air raid alerts had been issued twice before in the Normandy area. (Reuters dispatch on the 24th)

German Artillery Range　Threatens the Heart of Britain

London　Well-informed military sources stated last night that the range of the German artillery deployed in the northern campaign is now capable of reaching British ports. British and French forces will quickly launch a large-scale counter-offensive, attempting to eliminate the German salient on both flanks. British military authorities warned that "premature optimism" is not warranted at this time, as the outcome of this major and secretive battle involving the Allied forces will only become clear in a few days. The military strength of Germany "should not be underestimated." Prime Minister Churchill reported in the House of Commons yesterday that German forces had advanced to the vicinity of Boulogne, but fighting was still intense there last night. British military circles commented that the German mechanized units are attacking Boulogne, which is 18 miles from Calais. If the German forces are not reinforced by infantry, they will not be able to hold their ground there. Neutral military observers said that the fall of Boulogne would be a major blow to the Allied powers. If Boulogne falls into German hands, will it be impossible to defend Calais? The potential retreat of the British Expeditionary Force from northern France will also be jeopardized. According to the German plan for invading Britain, the Germans could use artillery and air power from Boulogne to attack British ports. Suspicions about a German invasion of Britain were dispelled last night after an official spokesman in Berlin stated that Germany's main objective was to conquer Britain. When Prime Minister Churchill announced in the House of Commons yesterday that German forces had advanced to Boulogne, he also emphasized the seriousness of the current situation. He stated, "German armored units have broken through the French lines and outflanked the Allied forces in Belgium, attempting to disrupt Allied communications. Abbeville has fallen into enemy hands, and Boulogne is currently the scene of intense fighting. It is difficult to predict the outcome of the battle for the ports, but the gravity of the situation is quite evident. At this moment, General Weygand, the Supreme Commander of the Allied forces, is directing Allied forces in an attempt to restore their joint front." (Associated Press dispatch on the 24th)

London　A spokesman, commenting on the latest French communiqués in a French radio broadcast, said that although the situation is serious, there is no reason for discouragement. The Allied forces are currently firmly holding their ground. (Reuters dispatch on the 24th)

### German War Bulletin

Hitler's Headquarters　The German war bulletin today stated that the German offensive is progressing quite successfully. The area within northern France and Belgium occupied by Allied forces has decreased since yesterday. In Flanders, German forces broke through the defensive line of the Scheldt River, and Tournai has been occupied by German forces. In the area of Artois, German forces occupied Mount Loretto, located northwest of Arras. Yesterday, German armored forces advanced northward near Arras. Enemy attacks south of Amiens were repelled. During reconnaissance flights by the German Air Force near Boulogne, heavy bombs were dropped, hitting one cruiser and three destroyers, and sinking six troop transports. A total of 49 enemy aircraft were lost yesterday, five shot down directly in aerial combat, eight shot down by anti-aircraft fire, sixteen German aircraft missing, and the remainder destroyed by German aircraft on the airfield. It was discovered today that on the 21st and 22nd, enemy forces launched fierce assaults in an attempt to break out of the encirclement, but ultimately failed to achieve their objective, losing 56 tanks in the process. The German Air Force in the Narvik area bombed enemy camps and landing troops with considerable success, one enemy destroyer was shot down, and a cruiser and troop transport were both hit and heavily damaged. Enemy aircraft attacked western and southwestern Germany last night, but Germany sustained no losses. (Haitong dispatch on the 24th)

The Situation is Serious but Not Hopeless　Britain Trusts Weygand's Strategy

London　Well-informed sources told Reuters last night that responsible individuals in London are not denying the seriousness of the current war situation, but the situation is by no means hopeless. Prime Minister Churchill's statement in the House of Commons that there is fighting around the city of Boulogne shows that the German attack on the English Channel ports was sudden and rapid. Although this poses a serious threat to Allied lines of communication, these lines are currently not in danger. From the Allied perspective, the speed with which the Allied forces can launch a large-scale counter-offensive is the key to the strength or weakness of the entire war situation. In this regard, both the British and French armies have great faith in General Weygand, the Supreme Commander of the Allied forces in all theaters of war. During the Soviet-Polish War in 1920, General Weygand used his strategy to drive back the Soviet forces that had reached the outskirts of Warsaw, preventing the Polish army from collapsing. (Reuters dispatch on the 24th)

German Troops Fail to Cross River in Belgium　Allied Positions Gradually Stabilizing

London　A Reuters military correspondent, commenting on the French war situation, said that the overall situation remains very serious. The fact that the German forces attempting to cross the Scheldt River at Oudenaarde in Belgium were repelled by the Allied forces, and that the positions were secured and strengthened, is of extreme importance. Although the German forces that entered through the gap in the hills north of the Somme River are only light elements of armored divisions, they have proven to be fierce fighters and adept at quickly establishing and holding defensive positions, making it extremely difficult to destroy their fortifications and drive them out later. The current war will likely continue its "fluid" nature for some time. Although both sides are engaged in counter-attacks, a major offensive should not be expected until General Weygand's plans for a major counter-offensive have been completed. General Weygand recently inspected the entire front line, and observers who saw him said that the general looked calm and composed, with an air of sharp intelligence evident in his eyes.

### French Strategy　Major Mistake　Commentary from German Newspaper

Berlin　According to the "German General Report," French military operations are heavily influenced by the Maginot Line. Although this fortress line has value, the troops defending the fortress tend to rely on the fortress and lose the opportunity to take preemptive action. The French plan of operations is limited to defending the Maginot Line. The troops covering the defensive line include fortress troops, elite mobile units, and mobile reserves. General Weygand believes that these covering troops must be mechanized and motorized, and must utilize active-duty cavalry. They must maintain a constant state of readiness. Covering and mobility are the main objectives of the French military organization. Former French Chief of Staff General Diefenbach has discussed the issue of covering the defensive line. He believes that the main task of the covering troops is to contain the advance units of the enemy, but he also believes that a purely defensive war will inevitably lead to failure. French military writer Brouillard states that the French army can hold the Maginot Line and wait for Britain to mobilize one million troops from Africa and other autonomous territories. Generals Pétain and Motteke both believe that the covering troops must be ready to defeat fierce attacks at any time. If the covering troops are forced to retreat, the entire French defense structure will immediately collapse, losing the opportunity for maneuver. General Duval believes that any defense plan includes both offensive and defensive elements. In the Lorraine sector, both Germany and France have built fortresses, making it difficult to attack. The situation on the Alpine front is similar. If there are no changes in the international situation, France can only adopt a defensive posture militarily. However, Britain hopes to launch an offensive against Germany, advocating that French troops attack the German Ruhr region through Belgium, and hopes that Belgian troops will assist in the attack. The Allied forces were prepared to attack in May of this year, but due to the mistaken belief that the Maginot Line was an impregnable fortress, they planned to hold the Maginot Line in northeastern France and attack Germany through Belgium. However, this plan was shattered by the German breakthrough of the Maginot Line. (Haitong dispatch on the 24th)

### Flame-Throwing Tanks　—Appears on the Western Front—　The Most Powerful German Assault Weapon　Driven by Experts Wearing Asbestos Suits

Paris　The newest and most terrifying weapon of modern times appeared on the Western Front yesterday, namely the German "Flame-Throwing Tank" driven by experts wearing asbestos military uniforms. The German army is using this new type of destructive monster in an attempt to rescue German troops that have broken through to the English Channel. According to reports from "La Liberté," this army has suffered losses of more than 1,400 tanks, armored vehicles, and lightly equipped motorized units in ten days of combat, due to the fatigue of the soldiers and the difficulty of replenishing fuel. This "Flame-Throwing Tank" is designed for wholesale massacres in towns and villages, and for attacking fortified defense lines on the front lines. It can be called the most perfect creation of military engineers, with extremely high destructive power and resistance. The "Flame-Throwing Tank" is fast, agile, and well-equipped for defense, with two machine guns and one 37mm cannon per vehicle. Its "flame-thrower" protrudes like a long spear shaft.

### British Air Force Displays Great Power　Heavily Bombs German Tank Columns　Dropping High-Explosive Bombs as Dense as Raindrops　Also Penetrates Deep into Germany to Disrupt Communication Lines

London　The Air Ministry announced last night that large formations of Blenheim British aircraft yesterday again heavily attacked the enemy tank and armored vehicle vanguards advancing towards the English Channel ports, continuously bombing and strafing them in shifts for more than six hours, causing the enemy troops in a vast area to suffer losses and fall into disarray, until dusk, when enemy movements could no longer be identified. The first targets attacked by British aircraft in the afternoon were a column of trucks and armored vehicles advancing. Blenheim British aircraft successively hit the trucks with bombs, and a portion of the 600-yard-long column was seen exploding. As the British aircraft approached one by one to bomb, they were subjected to dense fire from 30 accurately aimed anti-aircraft guns. After the British aircraft dropped their bombs, they turned to strafe the gunners. Another batch of Blenheim aircraft successively attacked several targets. Later, the British aircraft that arrived discovered that the trucks and vehicles had been bombed and were burning on the side of the road. The last target attacked by British aircraft was the headquarters of an armored division. The British specially selected Blenheim aircraft to attack the headquarters, dropping nearly 100 high-explosive bombs, many of which exploded within the target area. Last night, large formations of British heavy and medium bombers attacked targets behind the lines in southern Belgium and the Somme River area, causing heavy damage to road and rail junctions. A railway junction in Charleroi was bombed and damaged, bridges in the Namur area were hit by bombs, and enemy forces in the area north of the Aisne River were also heavily bombed. Other heavy bomber formations penetrated deep into Germany, causing significant disruption to enemy communication lines, dropping bombs and hitting railway bridges and branch lines. Two trains carrying military supplies were hit by bombs in the Kiel area. As the British aircraft were returning, one of them still had a bomb left, which it dropped on a naval airfield, hitting the runway. Another aircraft penetrated deep into Germany, flying as far east as Leipzig to bomb a major power station in the Lousa area. After the British aircraft carried out these large-scale night attacks in various locations, they all returned. The fighter aircraft were also very active yesterday, continuously attacking targets over the front lines with considerable success. In various engagements, more than 40 enemy aircraft were destroyed or heavily damaged, and six British fighter aircraft were missing. Yesterday, Blenheim and Lysander British aircraft continuously harassed the movements of enemy forces in various war zones in northeastern France and Belgium. Five British aircraft did not return. In summary, the fighting continued throughout the day without diminishing in intensity. (Reuters dispatch on the 24th)

### US Senate　Passes Naval Defense Program　Budgeted at Over US$1.4 Billion　To Expand Pacific Naval and Air Bases

Washington　The US Senate yesterday, after only half an hour of debate, unanimously passed the naval bill within President Roosevelt's proposed emergency defense program by a vote of 78 to 0, totaling US$1,473,000,000. The bill stipulates the prompt construction of 200 new warships and the addition of hundreds of naval aircraft. The Senate had previously passed another unprecedented defense bill, namely the US$1,823,254,624 Army Supplementary Bill. The Army and Navy Supplementary Bills had already been passed by the House of Representatives and were returned to the House last night for passage of the amendments made by the Senate. The two bills will be submitted to the President for signature before the end of this week. The defense program stipulates the construction of a massive navy, high-speed mechanized units, a powerful army, 50,000 aircraft, and the construction of new defense bases around the United States. The US government will spend hundreds of millions of dollars to build naval and air force outposts in the Pacific, the Caribbean, the Panama Canal Zone, and along the east and west coasts of the American continent. The President can use a blank check to order the Navy to build air force and submarine bases on Guam, 1,200 miles south of Yokohama, Japan. With the exception of the Philippines, the United States will also expand air force and naval bases on the American islands in the Pacific. The government is currently focused on ensuring that the countries of the Western Hemisphere can be self-sufficient and cooperate with each other in wartime. After the President signs the Army and Navy Supplementary Bills, he will instruct the State Department to consult with the countries of the Americas on finding air force and naval bases along the coasts of Central and South America, in accordance with mutual defense treaties. The United States will also launch exploratory and experimental efforts in Central and South America, striving to obtain wartime necessities that the Western Hemisphere cannot currently obtain, developing tin mines and rubber, and is proceeding with efforts to avoid reliance on supplies from the Dutch East Indies.

### The Future Fate of the British Navy　Under Study by US Authorities

Washington　The grim possibility that the British Navy may be controlled by Germany is now weighing on the minds of US government officials. Official reports from London and Paris believe that if Hitler defeats the Allied forces on the continent, he will continue to demand the surrender of the British fleet and demand reparations from Britain. This speculation is based on the air force blitz tactics used by Germany in Poland and the Netherlands. Officials here believe that if the British fleet falls into German hands, it could become a threat to the United States. One official said that once Hitler obtains this weapon, he can occupy all of the Allied possessions in the Western Hemisphere at will. Germany may eventually invade South America. "We wouldn't be surprised." It is also widely rumored in diplomatic circles that the State Department has long been carefully studying whether the British fleet should continue to fight, retreat in panic, or surrender if the German army, relying on its powerful air force, forcibly crosses the English Channel and attacks the British mainland. However, officials at the State Department deny that this has ever happened. Authorities in the naval sector believe that the possibility of the British fleet being captured by Germany has been considered by the British high command, and "appropriate measures" have been devised to prevent it. However, naval spokesmen declined to comment on whether these measures are sufficient to cope with the future crisis. According to estimates by naval experts, the strength of the British and American fleets is roughly equal. If the British fleet falls into German hands and joins forces with Germany's powerful air force, it could surpass the strength of the United States. Personnel at the Navy Department have also reiterated old stories from a few months ago, saying that Admiral Stark warned Congress that the US Navy must be prepared to encounter a victorious Germany. One spokesman said that personnel at the Navy Department's combat aircraft division have been racking their brains every night to study the important issues arising from Germany's current victory.

### All Sectors of the United States　Voice Support for the Allied Powers　Advocate for Effectively Curbing German Aggression

Washington　Democratic Senator Pepper yesterday spoke in the Senate, urging the United States to immediately assist with goods, money, and aircraft, so that the war situation will shift in favor of the Allied powers, and advocated that the United States should notify Hitler, telling him that we are his distant enemies, all wishing for his destruction, as a political force. If we sit here day after day, only discussing building safeguards around the United States or around the Western Hemisphere, we will create the greatest tragedy in history. (Reuters dispatch on the 24th)

New York　Twenty-seven prominent American Christians recently issued a declaration, urging the United States to immediately mobilize its spiritual and material resources to assist the Allied powers. They said, "The American people must decide whether they are prepared to face the future in practical isolation, or to give aid to European countries, so that German aggression can be curbed. The lives, beliefs, and intellectual freedoms of hundreds of millions of people in countries that cherish peace depend on the outcome of this war. The Nazi ambitions will soon reach Latin America, and the interests and principles of the United States are now in danger. If Germany is victorious, the next generation of Americans will be engaged in a huge program of national preparation, and all interests will be sacrificed for defense, involving everything beyond material interests. Therefore, we urge the United States to immediately assist the Allied powers with its spiritual and material resources." (Reuters dispatch)

Toledo　US Secretary of Commerce and former Minister to Canada, Roper, yesterday spoke here, expressing dissatisfaction with the "situation where the United States does not quite trust the Allied powers." He stated that the United States should transport various supplies to the Allied powers through barter or various other possible means. The Neutrality Act and the Johnson Act should be amended to meet the responsibilities of the United States in the current crisis. All important supplies should be exempt from the cash-and-carry restrictions. Roper also expressed his opinion that if the terms of the Treaty of Versailles had been less severe and the United States had immediately joined the League of Nations, the world would never have heard the name Hitler.

### Roosevelt Prepares　Radio Address　To Defend His Own Position

Washington　The "Washington Daily News" believes that Roosevelt's attempt to adopt a blitz strategy against the Republicans has not been successful. The Republicans will never grant Roosevelt dictatorial powers. General Johnson said that surveys of American public opinion show that the attitude of the states in the Central and Western regions is still very firm, unwilling to be drawn into the vortex of the European war. However, now that the American people know that the country's national defense is weak, almost non-existent, everyone feels the need to strengthen national defense and consolidate military preparedness. When Roosevelt delivers his radio address next Sunday, he will offer explanations and defenses of the various criticisms from the opposition. At the same time, Mrs. Roosevelt will appeal to the American people to donate money to the Red Cross to help the men and women in Belgium, the Netherlands, Britain, and France who have suffered from the war. Republican leaders such as Martin, Hoover, Dewey, and Taft will also deliver radio addresses, each expressing their own views. (Haitong dispatch on the 24th)

### United States Concerned About　Sovereignty of Two Islands　Greenland and the West Indies　US Assistant Secretary of War Delivers Speech

New York　US Assistant Secretary of War Johnson delivered a speech yesterday, stating that the United States is extremely concerned about any attempts to change the sovereignty of Greenland or the status quo of the Dutch West Indies. Greenland and the Dutch West Indies are both territories in the Western Hemisphere. Due to the recent European war, Denmark, the former owner of Greenland, has lost its sovereignty, and the Netherlands, the owner of the Dutch West Indies, is engaged in a struggle for survival. The question of who will rule Greenland is now a matter for the Americas, and who should take over the Dutch West Indies is also a matter for the American republics. If these two regions fall into the hands of non-Americans, it will endanger the security of the entire Western Hemisphere. Johnson also stated that the only way to keep the Western Hemisphere from being drawn into the war is to form a strong and united America. (Associated Press dispatch on the 24th)

### Tokyo Metropolitan Area Suffers Another Water Shortage

The Kokumin Shimbun recently reported that since January of this year, the area has experienced a prolonged drought with no rain. Water supply has been repeatedly interrupted. Currently, water supply in several districts of the city has been completely cut off. Water trucks loaded with water tanks are being dispatched on the streets for distribution. The municipal authorities are currently planning improvements day and night, but cannot solve the current water shortage in the short term. In addition, the population of Tokyo is gradually increasing, soon reaching 9 million. According to this calculation, the demand for tap water will increase by 100,000 tons per year. The situation is bound to become more serious. (Havas dispatch on the 22nd)

### Central Government Promulgates New Regulations; Strictly Prohibiting Gold Exports

The Chinese government yesterday promulgated new regulations strictly prohibiting the export of gold and goldware. Passengers leaving China by sea, land, or air are prohibited from carrying gold or goldware. Those who wish to carry metal antiques or artworks out of the country must have them appraised by the authorities and deposit an equivalent amount of money into the customs office, which will then allow them to be exported. If they are not brought back into the country within one year, the deposit will be confiscated. Those traveling between various parts of China and passing through foreign territories are allowed to carry a certain amount of gold, but they must have a passport or other certificate proving that their final destination is within China. If the amount of gold carried exceeds the limit, an equivalent amount of money must also be deposited for a period of one year. Recently, an incident occurred in which an attempt to smuggle gold out of the country failed, which aroused great public interest. Near the Chongqing airport, a Chinese passenger about to depart for Hong Kong by plane was searched by customs officials, and gold bars tied to his legs were found and confiscated.

### Foreign Minister Wang Sends Letter to American Students

Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui yesterday presented his letter to American students to Maurice, a representative of the American Student Association. The main point of the letter is that Japan's invasion of China is a "gift from heaven" because Japan's invasion has allowed a new China to be created. The letter states that the savage and cruel destruction of China's education system by Japan has resulted in a total of two million dollars in damages to educational property alone. This destruction has not only failed to eliminate Chinese culture but has actually promoted the creation of a new China. Chinese youth have not surrendered to Japan because of the bombings. Chinese students have not been subdued by the invaders' torture. Many facts have proven that patriotic male and female students have traveled thousands of miles from the coastal areas to the interior to continue their studies or join the army. This is also a well-known fact. As for educators quickly selecting school sites, arranging equipment, and preparing for classes, their determination and will are the same as those of the students. The number of universities hastily moved from the war zones to the interior today exceeds that of 1936 before the war. This situation is sufficient to show that the spirit of the new China cannot be suppressed by military force. Today, the hardships felt by students engaged in research in research institutions in southwest and northwest China are unimaginable from the past. These hardships can truly be said to be a gift from heaven, because the future generations of Chinese youth, after experiencing these hardships, will be more self-governing and more able to cope with the complex problems of the future with great determination. The new China, which is currently undergoing baptism in deep water and scorching fire, will certainly bear a part of the heavy responsibility in the reconstruction of the world in the future. I say this not to exaggerate." (United Press dispatch on the 24th)

### Scenes of Three Wartime Capitals in Europe ( ) A Comparison of Paris and Berlin Before the Great War on the Western Front

In every way, Paris is worthy of being the capital of wartime France. The city is prepared for the coming of war and for being bombed. All expected disasters have various relief methods planned. Spending a day here is more exciting than a month in Berlin. Everything you encounter and hear involves volunteers and people helping wounded soldiers.

War is an equalizing act; the face of war is the same in every country. However, a person traveling from Berlin to Paris will immediately sense significant differences in the organization of the two governments and the two lifestyles. The French wartime government exercises control in some areas that is generally practiced in peacetime in the country across the Rhine. However, looking at the actual conditions of the two major cities, it is obvious that one government must participate in every matter, while in the other, even under the weight of war, the habits of private enterprise and individual nature are very strong and difficult to suppress.

An officer who had just returned to Paris from the front lines said: A nine-man French scouting patrol suddenly encountered a united team of fifty-four German soldiers. The French soldiers did not receive orders. Instinctively, they spread out in a long line, while the German soldiers remained united and advanced in formation. As a result, the French soldiers lost two men, while the German soldiers had seven captured.

Upon hearing this, we immediately drew a comparison between the German soldiers' united formation and the French soldiers' dispersed advance. When the enemy forces increase a thousandfold, can these soldiers who can fight independently defeat a mass army that moves on command and achieve victory? This is not only a serious question, but also a major outcome of the war. Furthermore, this European war is a long-term struggle of man managing machines, and Hitler is merely a mechanical body.

Two other comparisons between Berlin and Paris immediately caught our eye. Paris is not only the wartime capital of France, but also the wartime capital of the Allied forces. It is as clear as London being the political center, with Paris being the military center for both England and France.

The excitement in France is also a display of courage. France is well aware of the sharpness of German military power. Germany also does not underestimate France's military strength. However, the French keep their worries to themselves and believe that the vast reserves that the Germans boast about are not entirely fictitious. The enthusiasm for war is equally difficult to arouse in both populations. However, the Germans do not believe that the worst will happen, while the French believe that it is possible. They often think that disaster is imminent and are very pessimistic about the future. While determined to strengthen the front lines, they also want to enjoy the small comforts of ordinary life until the very last minute – white bread, conversation, thriving trees, and sunny cafes on the sidewalks. France rises together to face the national crisis, especially women and hardworking farmers. Farmers think that the fields they are cultivating this year will soon be deserted. They are very concerned and ask, "Will they still have hope of returning home?"

Berlin is exceptionally quiet, much calmer than Paris. France's restrictions on gasoline use are very broad. Private cars and official cars are seen everywhere on the roads, and their number and congestion are similar to pre-war levels. The use of cars in Berlin has been reduced to a minimum. Apart from buses burning mixed oil and trucks loaded with goods divided into two or three rows to save gasoline, the roads can be said to be empty. Pedestrians hurrying along the sidewalks rarely speak. Everyone has their own thoughts, and even when several people are together, they seem to be going their separate ways. It is especially quiet at night. With the lights controlled, driving on the avenue is like walking in a remote village. All the houses are completely dark, and no sound comes from the invisible doors and windows. Wandering in the tunnel-like streets, you can hardly hear a sound. Only footsteps and shadows indicate other wanderers. (To be continued)

### North China Army Controls Nanchang; Villages Near Nanchang Become Scorched Earth; Reasons Why the National Army Has Not Recovered Nanchang

A Nancheng dispatch: Last month, the National Army attacked Nanchang from both sides of the Gan River, with unstoppable momentum. Various strongholds 20 to 30 miles outside Nanchang City, such as the Xishan Wanshou Palace near the Niuhang Railway Station, Xiangtang at the intersection of the Gan-Zhejiang and Gan-Xiang Railways, Xiaxi and Huangxi, important places on both sides of the Fu River, and the Xincun stronghold, the high point on the Gan-Yue Highway, have been recovered by the National Army one after another. A member of a certain reserve division's political work team, who recently crossed the Fu River from Liangjiadu to inspect the outskirts of Nanchang, said that he first arrived at the newly conquered Xincun market town on the 20th of last month. Weeds were knee-high everywhere. Only a small road along the street was not covered with grass because it was used for Japanese military transportation. North of the street, excrement was scattered, white bones supported, and wild cats and rats were foraging everywhere. Walking across the Likou Bridge, there were no villages or trees in sight for twenty miles. When the Japanese army retreated, they burned everything down, with nine out of ten houses burned. In each village, the rubble and red-hot walls stood as a symbol of resistance to the death. Further east from Xincun to Xiaxi, Huangxi, Jianxia, and other places, for three to four hundred miles, not a chicken or dog was heard. Villages and houses were all reduced to scorched earth, and swallows could not build nests. Vast fertile fields and beautiful ponds were all deserted. The National Army was in high spirits in this attack on Nanchang. The high points of Beiliang Mountain, Yezi Mountain, and Ma'an Mountain, which the Japanese army previously relied on as fortresses on the west bank of the Fu River, all had strong fortifications. Outside the fortifications, there were barbed wire fences with tin cans hanging on them. There were also many wine bottles and broken glass under the barbed wire, so that when the National Army cut the barbed wire, the sound could be heard, which would hinder the National Army from climbing in. However, such heavy fortifications were all broken through by the National Army one by one. According to a high-ranking commander of the National Army, the recovery of Nanchang by the National Army was not a problem. However, the spring river is now rising, and Japanese warships can easily reach Hukou, making reinforcements easier. Even if Nanchang is recovered, it will become a passive defense, and the sacrifice will be great. The purpose of the National Army is a protracted war, so it is not in a hurry to recover Nanchang. As long as it maintains a siege and surprise attack posture, so that the Japanese army consumes its strength at a very high rate, the final victory can be achieved.

### Educational News: The Problem of Reforming Chinese Characters; The Ministry of Education Does Not Advocate Abolishing Chinese Characters; Will Actively Promote Phonetic Symbols; Latinization of Korean Will Inevitably Be Counterproductive; Chinese Characters Have Unique Advantages

(Chongqing, April 24th) In recent years, there have been many proposals from Chinese people regarding the issue of character reform, and there are also a few people who are enthusiastically advocating the Latinization of Chinese characters. In order to explore the central government's views on this issue, the reporter specifically visited the relevant personnel of the Ministry of Education, and was granted the following opinions: The issue of improving Chinese characters and teaching methods has been discussed for a long time. In the past, most of it was researched by ordinary people. After the founding of the Republic of China, the government began to hire experts to create phonetic symbols for the purpose of popularizing education and making characters easy to learn and use. These phonetic symbols are intended to assist in character teaching, not to replace the original characters. This is because our country's characters have a long history, and their structure and meaning have special advantages. The six principles of character construction clarify the form and function, and the four tones determine the correct sound and meaning. These are beyond the capabilities of other phonetic scripts. The reason why our Chinese nation has stood tall and independent in the world for thousands of years, entrusting its culture and uniting its people, relies on the unification of characters. If it is said that these characters are difficult to teach, then we should research and improve the methods, and not fundamentally abolish them simply because learning takes a little time. Elementary language teaching in countries such as England, France, and Germany also requires a longer period of teaching due to changes in reading and spelling. It is by no means that learning a few phonetic rules can enable one to spell all the words. It can be seen that no matter how complex or simple a country's characters are, there are only problems with teaching techniques, and it has nothing to do with the characters themselves. Methods can be improved, but characters should not be abolished.

The government's intention to actively promote phonetic symbols is to reduce the difficulty of character teaching. Literate people can master them in three days, and illiterate people can apply them in less than two weeks. National sounds and dialects can be easily spelled out, making them suitable for all situations. They are versatile and can convey any language. In popular education, they have the effect of being time-saving, labor-saving, quick to promote, and widely applicable. In order to test other phonetic scripts, the government has also promulgated the "National Language Romanization," serving as a second form of phonetic symbols. Practical teaching experience shows that spelling national sounds is quite convenient. However, after the so-called "Chinese Character Latinization Movement" emerged, some people actually advocated abolishing Chinese characters because they advocated phonetic scripts, which we really dare not agree with. Chinese character Latinization disregards the principles of phonetics. A syllable can do without a vowel, such as "ér zi" (son), which can be spelled as RZ, and "zì sī" (selfish), which can be spelled as Z8. It also ignores the four tones that are unique to Chinese characters, so that "mǎ" (horse) cannot be distinguished from "mǎi mǎ" (buy a horse) or "mài má" (sell hemp). "diàn dēng" (electric light) is no different from "diǎn dēng" (light a lamp). "Zhāng Xiànshēng" (Mr. Zhang) is mistaken for "zhāng xiānshèng" (Chapter Saint), and "qiáng dào ná dāo" (robbers taking knives) is mistaken for "qiáng dǎo ná dào" (the wall falls, take the road). Wouldn't this be counterproductive? If it is said that the four tones are not used in single words, and the meaning can be inferred from the context of the entire sentence, so that there will be no misunderstanding, then reading a sentence or word must be inferred from the preceding and following words and sentences before its meaning can be known. Which is faster and more convenient, one who knows the meaning by looking at the characters at a glance, is not difficult to say. And with enough to replace the words of Chinese characters, also belongs to do not match. This is from the theory of speaking, the Chinese character Latinization, also did not take into account, as for the abolition of Chinese characters, enough to destroy the unity of the national culture, the cutting of dialects, enough to impede the progress of the national language education, especially as a loss outweighs the gain, and the use of foreign alphabets, fight Chinese pronunciation, in the general people's learning psychology, always feel less cordial than learning the country's original characters, one also, learning the Latinized words, can not be applied to the community, still need to learn another Chinese characters, is not desire easy more difficult? Therefore, in order to promote literacy education and eliminate illiteracy, it is still appropriate to use phonetic symbols. As for saying that other countries have removed their original characters and adopted Latin, which has achieved good results, we should first study the comparison of the advantages and disadvantages of their original characters and Latin characters, and the reasons why they must be adopted, and the effectiveness after adoption, before making a judgment. If we turn our country's monosyllabic characters into phonetic characters, the complexity or impossibility can be imagined. In order to emphasize academic research, the Ministry of Education will not only actively promote the already promulgated phonetic symbols, but will also hire experts to study and discuss other character reform issues.

### American Chamber of Commerce and University Federation Host This Year's Students Studying in the United States; The American Acting Consul General's Speech Was Very Humorous

The luncheon held yesterday noon at the American Club to commemorate American Overseas Trade Week was hosted by the American Chamber of Commerce and the Shanghai American University Federation. In the center of the venue were portraits of US President Washington and the Founding Father of the Republic of China, Dr. Sun Yat-sen. In addition to American Acting Consul General in Shanghai, Patrick, and leaders from the education and business sectors, there were also several Chinese students studying in the United States. This luncheon was hosted by the American Chamber of Commerce and the Shanghai American University Federation to welcome this year's Chinese students studying in the United States. Representatives of the Chinese students gave speeches to the American Acting Consul General and leaders from the education and business sectors, with the witty saying, "We will never forget our responsibility to strengthen the friendship between China and the United States." The speakers elaborated on the current situation in China and the efforts to promote friendship between China and the United States. The Chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Smith, said, "Friendly relations between countries are based on trade." Mr. Patrick said, "I will consider you to be ambassadors sent by China to the United States to adjust diplomatic relations. I deeply regret that only half of you can be called ambassadors, because the other half will be ambassadors' wives. However, your biggest task at present should be how to become valuable, just, and forward-looking citizens of China." He also mentioned that he has been in Shanghai for several years and, based on his experience with Chinese and foreign people, he deeply feels that students studying in the United States often have a better educational foundation. Finally, he praised the beautiful environment of American universities, which moved everyone present. The Vice President of St. John's University, Shen Siliang, also gave a speech, saying, "Students studying abroad have important tasks in the international arena, and friendly relations between countries are also the foundation of international trade. The European war and the Sino-Japanese war have shown that using violence to trade is not a reasonable method, and this must be paid close attention to. Therefore, I hope that you students studying in the United States will bring back to the motherland the knowledge that is beneficial to China and necessary for the country."

### Sports News: Public Concession Spring Police Sports Meet Grand Finals Today; 2:00 PM Horse Racing Begins; Fifteen Teams Compete in the Two-Mile Team Race

### Finance: Foreign Exchange Fluctuations Are Difficult to Predict; Sometimes Tight, Sometimes Loose, Depending on the European Situation

Yesterday, the foreign exchange market saw no changes in the HSBC listing. The black market for British and US dollars was unexciting, and prices were stable. However, because the exchange rate fluctuated from time to time, the British and US exchange rates moved in opposite directions. Today, the exchange rate fell by more than 4.5 points. From the opening to the closing of the market, the situation became one of a strong US dollar and a weak British pound. As for the buying and selling process, the supply from Sassoon and other companies was good in the early morning, and there was news that the Italian army had moved out, so the market tended to ease. However, at noon, there was a sudden rumor that the Italian army would help the Allied countries, and the market tightened again. There were many arbitrageurs. For example, Foreign Bank posted a sterling rate of 15.625, which is about 3.3% per month. The market was quiet in the afternoon, and there were few transactions. Only American Bank released some US dollars, and the price rose slightly. As a result, the British gold rate was 4 pence 14.0625, and the US dollar rate was 5 yuan 53.125. Compared with the closing rate of the previous day, the British pound was stronger by 0.5625, and the US dollar was weaker by 0.03125. This month's futures and spot prices have already been flattened.

### Sassoon China Merchants Speak Out

In the morning, the London Big Bar rose by 0.625, and the long-term rate rose by 0.5625. The New York silver price remained flat, and the London gold price remained unchanged. The exchange rates for British, US, French, and other currencies were all flat. The US dollar fell by 4.5 points against the British pound, fell slightly by 0.1 yuan against the Shanghai dollar, and fell sharply by 0.5 points against the French franc. The central government's listed exchange rates remained the same. Banks opened spot selling prices in the morning, with the British gold rate at 4 pence 0.125 and the US dollar rate at 5.5 yuan.

Free Talk: A Letter to a Friend on Cultivation Zhou Wu
Under the lamplight, I unfolded my dearest friend's letter, the lines filled with melancholy and sorrow. She told me that after reading Ba Jin's "Family," "Spring," and "Autumn," these novels, and then looking back at her surroundings, she felt enveloped in darkness and was deeply saddened. She also said that one night, after reading "Bitter Fruit," she cried alone for a long time.

I closed my eyes, and I could still see her worried and distressed appearance. So, I immediately pulled over a piece of paper, picked up my pen, and wrote swiftly, telling her this in the letter.

"I think you are a bit pessimistic, and you are wrong to do so. I know your surroundings are not good, but you must not think that the world is full of such despicable and lewd things and feel discouraged. You should look at the other side of the world, the bright side, which is the lovable part of the world, those kind, loving, great, and upright people. You should strive to stand up.

"As for the novels you have read, their main purpose is to expose the stains in society and families. Of course, it is not easy to see the bright side in them. Why don't you go and read another type of book? Like "Little Women" and the like. In short, you must not, based on the statements in these few books, hastily make a judgment saying: This world is too terrible, everywhere is full of despicable and inferior things, not worthy of our remembrance.

"You are greatly mistaken in this view!

"You must know that the world inherently has both good and evil, there is baseness, but there is also nobility. You must not think that the whole world is so dark because of the bad surrounding environment. The West has a saying: There are obstacles everywhere in the world, but there are paths to overcome obstacles everywhere. We can also say: There are base and dark things everywhere in the world, but there is also light to overcome darkness everywhere!

"For example, in Shanghai, there are speculators manipulating the market, treacherous people flattering and doing evil, and gangs of people who are drunk and merry all day long going in and out of dance halls; but at the same time, there are also people working seriously with bright hearts. And you can look further, to the groups of people who are fighting bloody battles on the battlefield for justice and working hard in the rear, you should be able to clearly see the bright and lovely side of the world.

"Look! In such a lovely world, can you have no slightest attachment? Can you not rise up and strive to add a little more light and beauty to the world?"

I ended the letter like this. Living: Please Write in the Morning Zhu Yuan
From a writer's experience, soul-stirring works are often written at night rather than during the day. Writing at night has its advantages, which everyone can experience. When all sounds tend to be quiet, when family members are deep in slumber, and even the crying of children is gone, when you are the only one in the room wielding your pen, thoughts flow like a galloping steed, allowing you to roam freely. Moreover, the night is endless, and no one will disturb you, allowing you to focus on writing until dawn. There are perfect reasons for writers to prefer late at night for writing.

Therefore, writers also inevitably suffer from several pitiful diseases due to writing late at night. For example, because the normal rest time is deprived, relentless insomnia, neurasthenia, ... and even pulmonary tuberculosis, etc., come uninvited. Exchanging time with decline and disease, forcing oneself to bury oneself in writing under a dim lamp during the night that should be used for rest, is a flaw in the world, an unbalanced life.

Here, the early timing of the work of writers should be coordinated with the early timing movement that is prevalent in society today, as one of the calls for the overall requirement, and it is necessary to promote and advocate it among writer friends. Utilizing the morning is no worse than utilizing the evening. In fact, not everyone can sleep three hours a night like Edison, and after "burning the midnight oil" or "continuing into the day," the habit of getting up early is also lost.

Why not change the time used in the evening to the early morning?

I remember when I was in school, major courses, especially mathematics, were listed as the first class at 8:00 in the morning. The reason is that mathematics requires a certain amount of calm thinking, and the morning often has a refreshing mind. Writing articles is also a more in-depth thinking work, and it is more suitable to write in the morning than late at night, especially in terms of the quality of the writing, I believe that what is written at night will not be more brilliant than in the morning. Of course, the "morning" referred to here is not the "going to the office" time that Shanghai people are used to. We hope to be earlier. For example, at six o'clock, the sky is clear, the sun has just revealed a glimmer of golden thread, and outside the house, by the road, there should be sparse footsteps, and the sound of wheels is still sparse. At this time, spreading paper and writing directly, even if it is just sitting by a small window, brilliant articles can also come from the pen in an endless stream.

Let us try our best to enjoy the precious early morning. Repentance After Gambling Jin
Losing the regularity of life, from scattered, low-level amusements, to a financial drain: gambling.

"Play mahjong, to hell with national affairs!" The third type of person I used to hate extremely is exactly who I am today. Every time I come back after playing cards, because of the money lost, the precious energy and time consumed, a series of regrets prompts the implementation of a vow: I will never gamble again next time!

But the tight money in my purse makes me want to get some windfall. Charity lottery tickets are bought, but nothing; lottery tickets are bought, but nothing; the slot machine ate up more than three yuan of my money... it's still better to play mahjong...

But will I win? The saying goes, "The gambling den bankrupts the poor." If I calculate carefully, I have already lost more than thirty yuan. Where does someone like me get so much money? The only way is to be in debt, gambling away friends' money as if it were my own. I seem to be numb.

Newspapers almost every day publish articles about people who have gone to ruin because of gambling. I am still young, I used to have a clear mind and sound thoughts (although gambling has messed up my mind, it cannot ruin my future). I want to take these back and rebuild the foundation of my life.

Tonight, on the long-abandoned manuscript paper, I write down my repentance. Correspondence: Amidst the Escalating War, the Culture of Three European Capitals Berlin Awaits the Arrival of Victory (Part 2) Shi Tao
Tasteless Wine
Recently, German beer has become almost like water. No matter what kind of wine it is, drinking some cannot make you drunk. The raw material for wine, wheat, is to be used as a general food, so Germany's famous beer has naturally lost its good taste. In wartime, the taste of wine is weak everywhere (Japan is also like this), but in Germany, the amount of wine is extremely scarce. In any hotel, you cannot drink as much as you want. Shortage, shortage, now, wine has simply become a restricted item: "Damn it, can Germany not have beer!" If you roar like this, then the other party will reply to you: "We are fighting a war right now. If we win this war, then we will definitely invite you to drink a lot." What kind of expression do Germans have when they drink water-like beer? But strangely, they are unexpectedly cheerful. Everyone has the ability to get drunk without drinking in their hearts, dancing with their lovers, drinking, and there is not a trace of a killjoy shadow on their faces.

During the last World War, the Germans experienced the most tragic and cruel things in the world, so they have a very strong resistance to war. According to the Germans, the reason why they were defeated in the last World War was to win in this war. In fact, the war did not just happen now. As early as seven years ago, when the Nazi Party came to power, the national life had already begun this war. Placing the interests of the country before personal interests, in order to rearm, every department of national life has long formed a strong wartime system. Therefore, this war is not a sudden major event in the eyes of the Germans.

The Serene Cultural World
Minister of Propaganda Goebbels once shouted: "Artists are soldiers in the rear." This sentence does not necessarily mean using drama or novels to incite national patriotism, although Germany is a militaristic country. However, since the start of the war, dramas and movies have not been filled with the atmosphere of war. On the contrary, the reading craze of the general public has a sense of vigor. What they love to read are old, orthodox literary masterpieces; classical famous pieces are also played in music. Some concerts show extraordinary popularity. To buy a ticket, you even have to run around Berlin. Due to political promotion, Germany and the Soviet Union exchange opera performances, so there are now Soviet operas being performed in Berlin. In fact, the German-Soviet agreement has extended to cultural agreements.

Since the war, there has been a pair of dark-haired movie stars from the Ufa film company who are very popular. The two of them, one old and one young, often appear on the stage, giving live performances and providing a lot of laughter. The general intellectual class welcomes this pair of artists very much. The intellectual class is now forgetting "doubt" and pursuing "laughter," and the government naturally supports this trend. Here, the reader can glimpse a glimpse of Germany's policy on domestic thought in wartime. Can Start a Prairie Fire Chen Xiong Hao

Entertainment World Traces of Entertainment Overseas Students Xiao Tian
Overseas student, what a dazzling title, but the overseas student mentioned in this article is not a doctor or master who has studied in various countries in the East and West. It turns out that it is a funny new term coined by someone in the Peking opera world. Usually, those who make a living by performing are called old masters or actors, and those who perform in their spare time are called amateur performers. Those who have never asked a teacher to teach them opera, but can sing a few lines after listening to a phonograph, and can actually sing along with the erhu, are called overseas students.

Overseas student seems to contain some sarcasm, but I don't think this is right. I have always liked teaching overseas students, because their singing is entirely out of love, without any coercion or being forced, and the layer of charm, those who learn Mei always have some resemblance to Mei, and those who learn Cheng, Yu, and Ma also generally have some meaning, which is much better than raw embryos being forced. Even compared to those who have studied with a teacher and become rigid, it saves a lot of trouble in abandoning old habits and innovating. A few years ago, I taught a few female actors who had sharp voices from who knows where, and it was really difficult to reform them.

Overseas students with shallow levels usually have a common problem, which is that they have tunes but no rhythm. Those with deeper qualifications have rhythm, but they always have to be one-third slower than the person they are learning from. Anyone who learns opera from me, as long as they are overseas students, ten out of ten have this problem. I always laugh and say that it is their old problem. Thinking about it carefully, I can't blame them, because to figure out the charm, the tempo will naturally be slower. But a slow tempo has two disadvantages. The first is that it takes effort. For example, when talking about the long tune of the third sentence of the Green Shirt's slow Erhuang, Chen Delin usually drags the "B" character to one and a half beats, but if you ask an overseas student to drag it, no matter what, they can't drag it to that length. Actually, it's not that the old master's breath is particularly long, but that the overseas student's beat is particularly slow. If it were according to the overseas student's particularly slow beat, even if the old master was resurrected, I am afraid that after dragging it to one beat, they would be out of breath. The second is that it is easy for the listener to feel bored. We can use phonograph records to test this. If in the record, whether it is Mei Lanfang or Cheng Yanqiu, they only sing for three minutes, but you have to sing for five minutes, then it is no wonder that the listener will be bored.

The first thing I do when teaching overseas students is to correct their beat, and the second is to adjust their tempo. As for the layer of charm, it is not a problem. As for the wording, once the tempo is accurate, the breathing will naturally not be too bad. Suddenly I thought of something and wrote a few sentences casually, alas, too verbose. "China" Hosts the South Seas Chinese Comfort Mission Hai Xing
——Chen Jiageng Welcomes Anti-Japanese War Films
The China Film Studio once hosted the South Seas Chinese Overseas Comfort Mission to view the studio's work. Guo Moruo gave a welcome speech, saying: "Mr. Chen Jiageng founded Xiamen University and Jimei School in the motherland, and also founded many schools in Southeast Asia, making great efforts in culture. Based on my experience, the longer one is away from the motherland, the deeper the love for the motherland. Your compatriots, returning to the country with full patriotic enthusiasm, are like hundreds of thousands of soldiers returning to the motherland, giving the compatriots in the motherland unparalleled excitement. In the future, going to the front line to comfort the soldiers will surely give the soldiers at the front line magnified courage and encouragement."

Then Mr. Chen Jiageng stood up and gave a speech, saying: "The overseas Chinese compatriots are eager to see the anti-Japanese war films of the motherland, and hope that they can be shown abroad more often, and cultural figures can go abroad to promote them more often. If people in the mainland do not receive education, they are still Chinese, but overseas Chinese who do not receive education from their own country will be assimilated by foreign countries, and their descendants will also become assimilated." Mr. Chen recorded in the studio, and the recording will be taken abroad by the South Seas Chinese Overseas Comfort Mission together with the news of the mission for screening. Mr. Chen also presented the studio with an inscription: "China Film Studio: The victory of the Anti-Japanese War depends on publicity. Chen Jiageng" One View on Appreciating Peking Opera "Mo" Ai Ping Shi Zhu
In dramas, in addition to the roles of male, female, painted-face, and clown, "Mo" is also an indispensable role, which insiders commonly call "sweeping the edge." This type of role, judging from the costume, seems similar to "young male" and the like, but in fact there is not much difference from "bearded male" and the like, but because there is a corrupt rule in the opera troupe, it is believed that when two "bearded males" appear on stage at the same time, the one with more singing and acting is respected as the "main male," and the other one is relegated to "Mo." For example, Chen Gong in "Catching and Releasing Cao" is a "main male" role, while Lü Boshe responds with "Mo," and another example is Li Keyong and Cheng Jingsi in "Bilian Village," one is the "main male" and one is "Mo."

The male in male, female, painted-face, and clown, according to Yuanqu, has no name of male, "Mo" is male, for example, "young male" is also called "young Mo," and "related male" is also called "related Mo." It is said that during the Yuan and Ming dynasties, the two words were originally used interchangeably. "Mo" has "main Mo," and also has "rushing Mo," "deputy Mo," and "small Mo." In addition to "Mo," there are also two types, "Wai" and "Outer." "Deputy" is slightly inferior to "Mo," such as Zhuge Liang in the first part of "Heroes' Gathering," Qi Jiguang in "A Pinch of Snow," and Yang Chun in "Four Scholars." The role played by "Outer" is even slightly inferior to "Deputy." The play it plays has very little singing and acting, such as Love Court in "Cinnabar Mole" and Song Guoshi in "Cinnabar Is Not," which is the general situation of the "Mo" line.

Originally, these days, in the southeastern provinces of China, it was also the season of rain. In the poems of the ancients, seeing what is called "a city full of wind and rain near the Double Ninth Festival," according to it, there will be a period of wind and rain at that time. After this wind and rain, the chrysanthemums will gradually turn yellow, and the river wind will turn completely red, revealing that brilliant autumn scene. Jin Danyun felt that the second attempt at learning was coinciding with continuous days of wind and rain, and she was inevitably a little disappointed. So she postponed it, saying that we could wait until the sky cleared after the public holiday, and then we could go and play, why bother going in the rain? Who knew that one rain lasted for nearly ten days. Occasionally there was a little sunshine, but by the evening, it was raining again. It was not until two days before the Double Tenth Festival that the sky was still covered with gloomy clouds, shrouding the earth. Zhu Airen was a little anxious in her heart. Freedom Village was preparing to invite everyone to have a lively day on National Day. Don't let the continuous days of rain keep everyone from coming, which would be disappointing, and Grandpa Lao Yi would also feel unhappy. Therefore, she wrote a letter to Jin Danyun, concise and brief. Jin Danyun's reply, however, was very sincere. She said: "No matter how heavy the wind and rain are that day, I will definitely come. Mrs. Su Yaya has made an appointment with her, and she is very happy. She would rather decline many banquets on National Day and would rather run to the countryside to observe the progress of the Chinese countryside. Jiancheng, because of the rain these days, has instead promoted his work and has already drawn up the plan for the factory buildings. Even the construction is well underway, and the estimation and contract are being finalized. Every day, the Shuangyu and Liyu sisters come to Our Country to discuss things. I heard that when their houses are under construction, Yuyu is preparing to go to the United States for a trip. Fortunately, planes go and planes come, and it doesn't take many days! The groundbreaking of the factory site can definitely be held as scheduled, and we will also invite many people to come and observe that day, so please rest assured." Zhu Qiang felt relieved after receiving that letter. She also called to comfort her grandfather, saying that no matter whether it was sunny or rainy, they would definitely come. Who knew that on October, the weather turned around, and by the afternoon, it was a good sunny day. In one night, the stubborn clouds were swept away, and a bright moon was pushed out, illuminating the earth with its brightness, so it could be known that tomorrow would definitely be a sunny day. The day before, Zhu Airen had already sent invitations to Wu Junsu and the Jun sisters, and they had also agreed to come, also because all schools, large and small, would have a holiday that day. As for the students and teachers of Soochow University, they might also come to Freedom Village to play. Also, Doctor Lao, who has recently devoted himself to the hospital and infant hospital, rarely leaves Anle Town. But Freedom is very close to here, and it only takes less than five minutes by car, so she will definitely come that day too.

### British Government Regulations: Indian Constitutional Policy to be Re-examined After the War; Secretary of State for India and Burma Responds to Questions in the House of Commons

London - Secretary of State for India and Burma, Leo Amery, responded to questions in the House of Commons yesterday, stating that we acknowledge planning a constitutional system that best suits India's circumstances and future, with Indians playing a major role. The British government has made a promise that all policies and plans will be re-examined at the end of the war. This naturally implies discussion and negotiation. We do not wish to delay any steps that lead to a mutually agreed solution, while considering legitimate demands and the interests of all sectors of society. We are eager to contribute to achieving this solution. The current difficulty lies in the significant differences in opinion among various Indian parties regarding the fundamental aspects of the future constitution, to the point that they cannot even come together to discuss the issue. I do not believe these differences are insurmountable. I think it is now possible to negotiate a temporary solution that would allow provincial officials to be reinstated with public approval, and to elect fair-minded individuals to join the Viceroy's Executive Council based on the foundation already provided. This is within the reach of Indian political talent. I believe this temporary solution to break the current deadlock will be warmly welcomed by the majority of the Indian people. From the beginning of the war, India has expressed sympathy and support for the principles of the Allied nations. In the current situation faced by the entire civilized world, the British government sincerely hopes that current disagreements will be set aside, and that leaders of major Indian political parties will unite to support the common effort.

### Southern Ireland: Defense Issues; Attlee Responds to Questions in the House of Commons

London - During today's session in the House of Commons, a Member of Parliament asked Prime Minister Churchill whether he was satisfied with all the necessary plans to prevent German forces from invading Britain via Southern Ireland. What would be the attitude of the Southern Irish government if it were invaded by German forces? Had he received any information? The Lord Privy Seal, Clement Attlee, responded on behalf of the Prime Minister, saying: "I dare say the Southern Irish government is fully aware of all possibilities, just as this government is. As for our own defense plans, Members will understand that I cannot make any statements." The Member also asked whether, in light of the serious danger to British security, practical measures had been agreed upon with the Southern Irish government to deal with any German attempt to invade via Southern Ireland. Attlee replied, "Members will understand that it is not appropriate for this government to give orders to the Southern Irish government. Southern Ireland is part of the British Commonwealth. However, all appropriate consultations have been made." (Reuters, 23rd)

Singapore - News today indicates that trade between the Dutch East Indies and Malaya has come to a standstill in the past week due to the lack of a market price for the Dutch currency in Java. Trade between these two regions is extremely important, as can be seen from the total trade volume of over £3 million in February. Currently, Dutch East Indies fish and vegetables are still being shipped to Malaya, but on a temporary basis. Some business conducted by merchants preparing to speculate is still proceeding as usual, but normal transactions have largely ceased. (United Press, 24th)

### Suma Discusses the Dutch East Indies Issue: Germany's Reply to Japan Guarantees No Interest

Tokyo - Foreign Ministry spokesman Kensuke Suma told reporters today in response to questions that Germany had replied on May 22nd to Japan's note of May 11th regarding the Dutch East Indies, stating definitively and without room for misunderstanding that Germany assured Japan it had no interest in the Dutch East Indies issue. The Japanese side views all replies or guarantees from any foreign government at face value. Asked if Japan had sent a communication to Italy on this matter and received a reply, the spokesman said no reply had been received, but informally there was reason to believe that the Italian government's view of the Dutch East Indies was the same as Japan's. Japan wishes to keep the East Indies out of the war and has reiterated that Japan has reason to believe that trade between Japan and the Dutch East Indies will not only remain unchanged but will be promoted. When Japan declared its concern for the maintenance of the status quo in the Dutch East Indies, the status quo in both political and economic aspects was included. (Reuters, 24th)

### Dutch Queen Reassures Colonial People; Broadcast to the East Indies

London - Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands broadcast a highly moving speech to the Dutch East Indies this morning, saying, "Although our people are forced to suffer pain, my confidence in the future remains unshaken.

Therefore, we must continue to be calm, courageous, and trust in the justice of our principles. We must restrain all changes in the situation, for we are now following a clear course, great principles, and are worthy of a strong and confident people, a people who have no other way but to resist unjust actions."

### Italy Celebrates National Day; War Commemoration

Rome - Italy today celebrated the 25th anniversary of Italy's entry into World War I against Germany by raising flags throughout the country. Political circles refused to acknowledge the contradiction between Italy's attitude in 1915 and today. The Rome People's Daily reported that Italy's entry into the war at that time was due to internal political difficulties. These difficulties have now become acute in the new Italy. The new Italy is young and vigorous, eager to develop, and eager to gain strength and glory. Many reliable observers here believe that the Italian military machine may begin to move in the next few days. (Reuters, 24th)

### British Government Arrests Elements Threatening National Security; Over Thirty Fascist Party Members Imprisoned; Many IRA Members Detained

London - Sir Oswald Mosley, leader of the British Union of Fascists, along with Beckett, Mosley's former chief lieutenant, and thirty-three other Fascist party members, have been arrested by the authorities under the Defence Regulations. Previously, fifty police officers searched the British Union of Fascists headquarters with lightning speed, seizing several documents. Shortly after, Mosley was arrested at his home in Chelsea. Special police have now completely occupied the Fascist headquarters and are questioning everyone approaching the building, while detectives are examining papers and documents seized from drawers and cabinets, as well as their filing system. Other key Fascist party members arrested include Townshend, Hawkins, Paulton, Captain Hick, Watts, McKichnie, Baronin, and Mrs. Dacre Fox. Home Secretary Anderson stated in the House of Commons that these arrests were not due to the opinions or propaganda activities held or expressed by the British Union of Fascists, but because the group was likely to be used to engage in activities that would endanger national security. Others arrested under paragraph 2 of Defence Regulation 18, unrelated to the arrest of British Union of Fascists members, include Captain Ramsay, a Member of Parliament and president of a right-wing club. It is understood that paragraph 2 of Defence Regulation 18 is an additional clause added as an amendment, enabling the Home Secretary to order the detention of members of groups who collude with the enemy, are controlled by foreign forces, or will be used to endanger national security.
