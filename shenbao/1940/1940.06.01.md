### Allied Forces Largely Retreat Across the Strait Under Naval and Air Force Cover; Isolated French Troops Break Through Encirclement in the Flanders Highlands; Flooding Around Couckelaere Hinders German Advance

Paris: This morning's communique states that fierce fighting continues in the fortified area around Dunkirk in the north. There have been some local actions by infantry on both sides of the Somme and Aisne rivers. Fierce artillery battles have occurred between the Aisne and Meuse rivers. Enemy forces once attacked between the Meuse and Moselle rivers but have been repelled. (May 31st, Reuters)

Paris: Military sources here recently stated that the port of Dunkirk in the Flanders region remains impregnable, with anti-aircraft artillery effectively managing air defense. The area around the port is almost completely flooded, with the flooded area extending several kilometers. Only one narrow path connects to the front lines, which is being defended by the Allied forces. The troops under the command of French General Prioux are retreating from south to north, and most of them have broken through the German-controlled highlands and entered a safe zone, establishing contact with the garrison in Dunkirk. A batch of wounded soldiers has been loaded onto ships and transported to England. The second batch of troops, although under pressure from the German forces, has also arrived in the highlands and is seeking to break through. The remaining troops are still fighting in the rear to cover the retreat. (May 31st, Havas)

Paris: Last night, the official announcement here stated that the majority of General Prioux's "isolated forces" strenuously broke through the encirclement of the Flanders region yesterday, escaping the German lines and reaching the English Channel. Two divisions of General Prioux's original eight-division army arrived in Couckelaere yesterday, with the remaining troops continuing to arrive later. At 8 PM last night, a military source told a news agency reporter, "The situation in the Flanders region is currently very critical. However, our…"

Paris: French military sources claim that the entire area southwest of Couckelaere, from Gravelines to Stomersee, has been flooded. The northeastern waterline extends from Nieuport along the Yser River to Ypres… In the past 48 hours, countless [soldiers in the Flanders Highlands]" (May 31st, Reuters)

Berlin: Today, German military officers commenting on the battle report stated that heavy fog over the English Channel obscured the visibility of German aircraft. As a result, British transport ships attempting to escape were able to avoid German bombing. The British forces suffered fewer losses in this crossing of the strait and can be said to have benefited from the opportune timing. (May 31st, Haitong)

London: The government announced that Allied forces are retreating from northern France under heavy attack. British forces have only lost three destroyers, HMS Grafton, HMS Grenade, and HMS Wakeful, a few auxiliary small boats, and the 689-ton small transport ship Apapa in the ongoing battle there. German claims of British ship losses are exaggerated. As for the Germans, they have suffered significant losses. Over 70 German aircraft were shot down by the British aircraft covering the retreat in the area on Wednesday alone. HMS Grafton and HMS Grenade are both 1,335-ton destroyers, each equipped with four 4.7-inch guns. HMS Wakeful is a 1,100-ton destroyer equipped with four 4-inch guns. According to the intelligence department, British and French forces in northern France were forced to retreat to the coast due to increasing German pressure from the north and south. They are now fighting along the coast, and the British and French retreat is proceeding in an orderly and decisive manner. British warships are providing artillery support to cover the troops and hinder German operations, inflicting heavy damage on the German vanguard. British troops who are not directly engaged in combat and the wounded have been safely evacuated, and some have already arrived in England. This action is being carried out calmly and resolutely day and night despite fierce enemy attacks, especially air raids. Royal Air Force aircraft are providing cover and engaging German aircraft from time to time. Over 70 German aircraft were destroyed on this line on Wednesday, and many more were damaged. A squadron of Defiant aircraft destroyed 35 enemy aircraft without any losses themselves. The German High Command's claim that it has inflicted heavy damage on British warships and their protected transport ships is not true. However, losses are unavoidable in an operation of this nature. The spirit and conduct of the British soldiers participating in these battles are beyond words. The battle is currently ongoing. (May 31st, Reuters)

Paris: A French military spokesman announced that Allied troops are continuing to hold their ground, not only within the Dunkirk defensive area but also west of the Yser Canal. The remnants of General Priver's forces, besieged near Lille, are continuing to advance north toward the Dunkirk area. (May 31st, Reuters)

London: A British transport ship, ordered to a certain French port to assist in the evacuation of the British Expeditionary Force back to the country, has returned to England. The crew informed Reuters reporters in London of the difficulties they faced, navigating through a hail of bombs and machine-gun fire. According to reports, the German attacks were like surging waves, with groups of German aircraft launching fierce bombardments on ships and troops gathered at the docks every ten or fifteen minutes. On the train carrying sailors to London were several soldiers of the British Expeditionary Force who had been rescued from the intense artillery fire by the navy. A sailor on one ship said that when his ship went to France, it was repeatedly attacked by German aircraft on the final leg of the journey. Bombs fell all around the ship, and the explosions created seawater fountains. At the same time, machine-gun bullets scattered across the deck. Another person said that the place was simply a transformed hell, with bombers filling the sky like stars, but dark and indistinct. Iron birds from both sides were fighting above them almost non-stop, because the Royal Air Force's fighters were doing their best to drive away the German bombers. The Royal Air Force's achievements are beyond words. In a word, "it was great!" The German aircraft must have suffered extremely heavy losses, but they still came continuously. Our army started about six miles from the coast, with aircraft arriving every fifteen minutes, trying to organize ships to sail to the port. All the ships sailed forward through a rain of bombs and machine-gun bullets, with bombers chasing after them. As they approached the port, Royal Air Force fighters pounced on them, and the coastal anti-aircraft artillery also opened fire, and not a few enemy aircraft fell. (May 31st, Reuters)

German War Report

Hitler's Headquarters: Large units of French troops in northeastern France have been either captured or... There are still a few isolated troops surrounded, putting up a stubborn resistance, but the strength of a spent arrow is waning and their elimination can be expected soon. Several British units are trapped on the coastal plains, with the flooded canals nearby serving as... Still, they are not giving up. British troops trapped in Cassel attempted to break out to the north but were annihilated by German forces. The number of prisoners and armaments recently captured by German forces is countless. Yesterday, the weather was bad, and aerial activity was greatly hampered, but German aircraft still bombed the port of Dunkirk. The German Navy is now protecting the entire Dutch coast and the French and Belgian coasts controlled by the German forces. A German torpedo hit an enemy destroyer not far from the Belgian coast. Last night, British military aircraft again attacked houses and people in northern Germany that were not related to the military. A German fighter pursued an enemy aircraft and shot it down over Holstein. In France, three French military aircraft were shot down. In Norway, over Stavanger, a British military aircraft was shot down. All of these victories were won by the valiant fighting of German aircraft. Two German aircraft are missing. (May 31st, Haitong)

French President Commends Frontline Soldiers; British Garrison in Calais Fights Heroically

Paris: President Lebrun recently telegraphed General Blanchard, commander of the Northern Army Group, saying, "The troops under your command are taking actions completely in line with the British Expeditionary Force and, with the assistance of the Allied fleet, are fighting bravely in the Flanders region. This glorious battle will be forever recorded in history. I hereby express my respect to the general on behalf of the motherland, and the entire nation also admires the frontline soldiers."

Editorial

### Handling Rent Issues After Tax Increases

The Shanghai International and French Concessions will implement increased land and house taxes starting July 1st. It is reported that the Chinese directors are planning to propose suggestions to the municipal authorities of the two concessions to strictly restrict illegal rent increases and to stipulate guidelines for rent increases due to tax increases. This would reduce the threat to the livelihoods of citizens and also reduce rent disputes, ensuring a reasonable and fair solution. The specifics of this plan have not yet been revealed, but it is undoubtedly for the benefit of the vast number of citizens who reside in rented houses. Rent has already generally increased in the past two or three years, but due to various restrictions, the increase is not as great as the increase in prices of goods. Landlords' profits are also not as high as those from speculation. Those who rent directly from the landlord can still maintain their peaceful enjoyment of their residence. However, there are also some extremely detestable cases, disregarding everything and brazenly increasing rents repeatedly. In addition, some force tenants to re-sign leases under the guise of changing landlords, or claim that they are taking back the property for their own use, or threaten to sell the building in sections. In short, all of these claims are untrue and are merely intended to make tenants unable to withstand their extortion and harassment in order to satisfy their desire to increase rent and greedily seek petty profits. Now that the tax increase is being implemented, what reason does the landlord have to care about public opinion or morality? We will see them confidently using the tax increase as a perfect excuse to increase rent. In this case, the so-called tax increase will not be borne by the landlords, but will ultimately be borne only by the masses who are already struggling with serious and unresolved livelihood issues.

In fact, rent and land/house taxes are mutually causal. As land/house taxes increase, rent increases, and as rent increases, the revenue from land/house taxes increases accordingly. This means that a 50% tax increase, after rent increases, will actually result in a higher collection. Therefore, in order to expand land/house tax revenue, the authorities certainly hope that landlords will generally increase rents. High land taxes increase the value of real estate, and high land prices increase land tax revenue. Through this cycle, those who bear this rent and tax are still the tenants who use the real estate. However, the land/house tax in the concessions is not like the special municipal districts, where landlords and tenants each bear half of the burden. Historically, tenants have always been responsible for paying the entire tax, with landlords not paying a single cent. Therefore, in terms of legal principle, the authorities' tax increase should not be used by landlords as an excuse to increase rent. However, even in normal times, landlords use all sorts of tricks to increase rent, and now that they have an opportunity to exploit, how could they not think of using it to increase rent? The authorities should be well aware of this possible development. Because prices have already soared and continue to rise, and livelihoods are becoming increasingly difficult, we should try to find ways to stabilize the prices of all goods, especially rent.

The concession authorities, in order to maintain administrative efficiency, must have their own difficult situation and must have their own difficulties, so the general residents understand the decision to increase taxation. But we have said it before, the disparity between rich and poor among the general residents makes it extremely unreasonable to require them to bear equal burdens. The current increase in land and housing taxes is indeed general, and although it is a matter of expediency, it is not without means of remedy. We believe that there are several points that the authorities should consider and stipulate, listed as follows:

(1) Those who have already increased rent after the August 13th Incident should not increase it again;

(2) The amount of rent increase should be based solely on the actual payment rate of this increased tax;

(3) If the rent includes water fees, after the water fees increase, the portion exceeding the previous amount should be averaged and distributed in the rent. However, other expenses should not be used as an excuse to increase rent;

(4) The authorities of the two concessions should each establish a Rent Adjudication Committee. Any landlord who wants to increase rent must first apply, submit supporting documents, and can only increase rent after review and approval. (Originally, applications for rent increases/decreases should be submitted to the court for approval, this is a special adaptation);

(5) The rent standards for subletting by second-hand landlords can be determined separately according to the internal location of the house, specifying the percentage of each rent that occupies the second landlord's total rent expenses (for example, the front building accounts for several percent, and the rear building accounts for several percent), so as to limit the exploitation of third tenants by second landlords;

(6) Strictly crack down on disguised transfer fees, service fees, and rental deposits. The calculation of rent should be limited to its original cost and should not re-evaluate the original cost based on current prices. Even for newly acquired old properties, there is indeed a trend of rising prices, but the current increase in real estate prices is by no means a reflection of a prosperous market. The authorities should understand the crux of the problem and should not become tools for landlords to squeeze tenants. In short, the authorities of the two concessions must prioritize the welfare of the masses. All measures that can reduce the burden of livelihood for the general public must be fair and reasonable, without any bias. Then, the increase in land and house taxes will be welcomed by the majority of citizens. Otherwise, it would be akin to fueling the arrogance of the wealthy who are not benevolent, with the upper and lower classes exploiting each other, exhausting the resources of the pond to catch fish. Even this distorted prosperity will be seen to be unsustainable.

### Several Batches of British Expeditionary Forces Escape the Fire and Arrive Safely in England; Exhausted from Prolonged Warfare; Villagers Along the Way Cheer in Welcome

London: Responsible sources in London claim that the painful efforts to rescue British and French troops from northern France are still underway day and night. The exact number of people who have left this "fire pit" and arrived safely in England cannot be confirmed at this time, but it is certain that the number is very large. During the retreat, the Allied forces continued to hold the covering line a few miles from the coast. The Germans said that they had forced the British army to retreat in disarray to the beach, and that the British army was now running away at the sight of the enemy. It is important to know that in a battle, there is nothing more difficult than retreat. The end of the retreat must be embarkation, and this kind of action requires more talent, courage and discipline than other battles. Moreover, most of the coast cannot be concealed, and it is impossible to retreat without the Germans knowing it. Therefore, there is absolutely no possibility of confusion, and the claim that the British Expeditionary Force is running away at the sight of the enemy is also out of the question. This is very obvious. (May 31st, Reuters)

London: Most of the British Expeditionary Force has returned to the motherland today, with overgrown beards, dirty bodies, and wounds all over them. These British and French soldiers, exhausted from prolonged warfare, are traveling by troop train towards England. At every station, countless villagers express their welcome, some even crying with joy. Since they participated in the bloody battle of the Flanders region, they have only now seen a peaceful scene again, seeing green, quiet mountains and smiling children. They have long heard the sounds of cannons and bombs, and only after leaving the French coast and boarding the train with their French counterparts did their ears begin to feel quiet. The soldiers of Britain and France are only today eating with knives and forks in the port's restaurants, but they are still wearing tattered, blood-stained, and ash-covered military uniforms. Some of them were transferred to fight when the Germans invaded the Netherlands and Belgium. The soldiers on the train are countless. From the windows of the train, you can see them huddled together, and some are sleeping soundly at the dining table in the dining car. The villagers living along the railway line have seen countless troop trains passing through the countryside all day long. There are also some sailors and even one or two aviators among the soldiers in the train. The aviators also carry the parachutes that they used to land safely. In many coastal towns, soldiers have difficulty getting food after landing. The people of the towns automatically provide food from what they have stored in their homes. All the returning soldiers generally described the same situation on the battlefield. It is said that when the German army attacked the English Channel, their actions were very barbaric, and even women and children were not spared. German aircraft fired machine guns at refugees from an altitude of 200 feet, like sweeping fallen leaves. When British and French soldiers boarded ships on the north coast of France, they were subjected to bombing and machine-gun fire from German aircraft. Even as they crossed the English Channel, several small Allied units continued to fight fiercely in the Flanders region to cover the withdrawal of these soldiers. Military authorities announced at 1:00 PM today that British and French soldiers are still withdrawing from northern France. Although it is not known exactly how many soldiers have withdrawn, the authorities say that a considerable number of soldiers have withdrawn from France. German aircraft and artillery are frequently attacking the ships carrying the retreating soldiers. (May 31st, United Press)

London: Several thousand soldiers of the British Expeditionary Force, transferred back from France, have arrived at a certain port on the south coast. Residents along the railway line south of London saw trains full of troops passing through the area. From the train windows, countless dust-covered soldiers could be seen lying on the table, feigning sleep and looking very tired. It is said that some of them had just retreated from the Flanders front two days ago. There were great difficulties in this army's retreat, and more will continue to arrive and will be landed at a certain port on the south coast. Although some soldiers were quite tired due to continuous fighting and lack of sleep, most of them were in good spirits and frequently cheered to the people outside the window. These soldiers said that the German army suffered extremely heavy losses in the battle for the ports of the English Channel, and that the British Air Force's combat technology was extremely superior. They also condemned German aircraft for strafing refugees and bombing hospitals. Several of the arriving soldiers had suffered minor injuries. When the troops disembarked, the crowd initially stood in silence, expressing their sympathy and respect, but the troops showed no signs of discouragement. They first waved happily to the crowd, who then responded with cheers. The soldiers all said in unison that they needed more aerial assistance now. The transportation mechanism carried out everything in an orderly manner, and a constant stream of vehicles carried the soldiers to the waiting trains. Some of them had not slept peacefully for several weeks, and many had not eaten for several days. However, after eating and drinking, they talked freely about the dangers they had experienced, the most terrible of which was the constant bombing from the sky, and even more appalling than this was the German aircraft strafing refugees with machine guns, with countless old and young men and women dying. A junior officer who had participated in the last battle said that he had never seen us bombard the German army so fiercely to stop them from advancing, but the German army still rushed into the artillery fire, and their losses must have been very heavy. As the troops boarded the ship, bombs and machine guns wreaked havoc in the sky. Many soldiers swam to board the ship, so their clothes were still wet. A Reuters interviewer saw officers and sailors from the Belgian and French armies at another central point. They said, "This is simply hell, but we rescued the heroes who stood on the triangular ground and resisted the German army until the fierce attack. Our flying division has had great achievements, but we need more air assistance. From the minute we arrived in France, we were immediately subjected to bombing from the sky and machine gun fire, and even hospital ships were not spared. When we were hit, we swam to the shore, but when our ship did not return, we swam back to the ship and drove it out of the port. Then the ship capsized, and we had to swim again. Some of us swam in the water for several hours before being rescued by a warship. All of us are either naked or have not eaten since yesterday and have not slept for three days. We not only rescued British troops but also rescued Belgian and French troops. The Belgian army did not want to give up the battle. Five Belgian officers in the team were surprised when they received the Belgian king's armistice order. According to an officer, they did not want to obey the king's order to stop fighting, and tens of thousands of Belgian soldiers held the same opinion." The British and French armies are still showing their heroism in the north. If they can give us more aircraft, the battle situation will be different from this morning. (May 31st, Reuters)

### Dramatic Changes in the International Situation: Roosevelt Again Asks Congress for a Huge Increase in Defense Spending, Adding $1 Billion for the Construction of Airplanes and Tanks

Washington - President Roosevelt recently stated that significant changes have occurred in the international situation in the past two weeks. As a result, the temporary defense funds he recently requested from Congress are no longer sufficient. He will ask Congress tomorrow to allocate an additional $1,000,000,000 for the construction of airplanes, tanks, artillery, and the manufacture of ammunition. Political figures commenting on this matter generally stated that President Roosevelt recently submitted a message to Congress requesting $1,182,000,000 for temporary defense expenses. The Senate divided this into two parts and incorporated it into the regular army and navy budgets, with a total of $1,823,000,000 under the army and $1,473,000,000 under the navy, totaling $3,296,000,000. Now, with an additional $1,000,000,000, the total will reach an unprecedented huge sum of $4.3 billion. (Havas dispatch from Washington on the 30th)

Washington - White House spokesman Mr. O'Leary stated that the President's message will also request appropriations to train one million soldiers and technicians. Mr. O'Leary continued that no conscription plan has been drafted; the President intends to quadruple the current U.S. standing army. Yesterday, the President convened the Civilian Protection Committee, with all cabinet members in attendance. Army Chief of Staff General Marshall and Navy Chief of Staff Admiral Stark also attended. This committee was appointed by the President this week to facilitate labor and industrial cooperation, thereby facilitating the government's defense procedures. Recently, Republican leaders in Congress requested a recess of Congress until the House Budget Committee and the Senate Finance Committee revise the entire tax structure. Republicans oppose increasing the national debt limit before the November election without first holding a new tax for the government. Senate Democratic Leader Barkley opposed the Republican proposal, stating that Congress can have everything in order by July 1 and can recess at that time. The Republicans only hope for a temporary recess during the Republican National Convention, which will begin on June 24. Democratic Senator Prentiss stated that the $25,000,000 to $50,000,000 listed in the relief bill may be diverted to national defense needs. Republican Senator Taft criticized the "New Deal" last night, saying that the shortcomings of American defense must be blamed on the "New Deal's" fiscal policy. Independent Republican Congressman Norris warned against American defense's "Fifth Column paranoia," saying that "talking about the Fifth Column" will make half of the loyal Americans suspect the other half, which will inevitably lead to war.

### America May Make Important Decisions Regarding the European Situation: Security Director's Speech on Memorial Day

Washington - Today is the U.S. Memorial Day for soldiers who died in the last European war. Representatives from all walks of life held a memorial ceremony at Arlington Cemetery. Federal Security Administrator McNutt (former High Commissioner to the Philippine Islands) attended and delivered a speech, stating that if Germany wins this European war, the dangerous situation facing the United States is well known. It is unknown whether our country will have to make extremely important decisions in a matter of weeks or even days. If Japan takes action against the Dutch East Indies, we will definitely encounter a major problem. In other words, the question of whether we should abandon our obligations to the Philippine Islands and permanently withdraw from the Far East must be answered. As for Europe, if the Allied forces are defeated and the German army seizes all or part of the British and French fleets, the United States must occupy the islands of the North Atlantic and the Caribbean Sea as a precautionary measure. In short, the Monroe Doctrine must remain the foundation of our foreign policy, and judging from the current situation in Europe and the Far East, there is absolutely no room for compromise on this doctrine. We must determine the terms of war ourselves and not allow future enemies to formulate them. To accomplish this task, we must build the world's strongest defense in the air, on land, and at sea.

### Rumor That Italy Is Encouraging Spain to Attack Gibraltar: Mussolini Eager to Try; Italian Newspaper Reveals British and French Plans for the Near East

Rome - According to recent news, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, in a speech to several Fascist leaders a few days ago, declared, "Rather than becoming a second-rate power, it is better to join the war now." At the same time, it is rumored that the Italian ambassador to Spain has arrived here by plane to confer with the Prime Minister on important matters. It is also rumored that the ambassador will soon fly back to Madrid. It is believed that the ambassador will carry Italian documents to Spain, detailing what Italy hopes from Spain if Italy joins the war. It is believed that Mussolini will ask Spain to attack Gibraltar. As for Italy's preparations for joining the war, they are continuing to await the Prime Minister's orders, as Mussolini has scheduled a cabinet meeting for next Tuesday to "discuss major events." The recently announced citizen mobilization regulations stipulate that all men aged fourteen to seventy and women aged fourteen to sixty must assume various non-combatant duties when Italy joins the war. The local press continues to advocate for war and lists Nice, Corsica, Tunisia, Egypt, Gibraltar, Malta, and the Dardanelles as areas that "Italy intends to covet." (International News Service dispatch from Washington on the 31st)

London - News here today is that Italian Foreign Minister Ciano has notified the British and French ambassadors in Rome that Italy's entry into the war is imminent. At the same time, according to sources in London's Italian community, British-Italian relations are deteriorating rapidly. It is said that Britain has proposed to Italy that it is willing to lift the blockade, but Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has rejected it. Well-informed sources say that although U.S. President Roosevelt recently sent a letter to Mussolini urgently requesting Italy not to join the war, Mussolini replied that Italy will help its Axis allies. (International News Service dispatch from Washington on the 31st)

Rome - A special correspondent for the "Italian News" newspaper, residing in Thessaloniki, published a plan by the Western powers to attack the Balkans. The correspondent claimed that French General Weygand concentrated troops in the Near East and, according to the original plan, would occupy Thessaloniki on April 29, aided by the British fleet, and then advance from that city to attack Albania and the Bulgarian-Marseille border. This plan failed to materialize because German troops occupied Norway, but Britain and France have not abandoned it to this day. Relatives of British and French personnel residing in Thessaloniki have already been evacuated. If Turkey attacks Alexandroupoli, a city in Bulgaria, Allied troops will land in Thessaloniki. The correspondent went on to discuss Turkish-Greek relations, emphasizing that Turkey should directly attack Greece in accordance with its agreement with the Western powers. Newspapers in Istanbul and Ankara are heavily criticizing Greece, causing the Greek authorities to ban the sale of these newspapers. British and French intelligence work in Thessaloniki is the responsibility of Captain Campbell, who organized the intelligence network. To conceal his activities, Campbell was appointed as the British Consul in Thessaloniki. The French ship "Tiburon" is under Campbell's control. Since May 9, it has stopped carrying cargo. A certain captain, who is an intelligence agent, is engaged in smuggling activities. An estimated 800 tons of military supplies, including 52 tanks and 72 tons of ordnance, were transported ashore without inspection by Greek customs, demonstrating that Campbell has almost completely stripped Greece of its coastal control rights.

### Advances in Southern Yangcheng, Southern Henan: Annihilation of Remnant Japanese Troops at Shijialing and Longzhang

Luoyang - Japanese troops invading south from Yangcheng invaded Longzhang and Shijialing at 4 PM on the 27th. After a fierce counterattack by the Chinese army and a night of fierce fighting, many Japanese were killed. Shijialing was recovered by dawn on the 28th. The remnant Japanese troops at Longzhang are still being surrounded and annihilated by the Chinese. The Japanese troops invading east into the area of North and South Xiangtai, and Upper and Lower Baisang, were dealt a heavy blow by the Chinese, with casualties exceeding half. The Japanese continuously reinforced, increasing to more than 2,000 men and six or seven artillery pieces by the 27th, and also used four aircraft to bomb and assist in the battle. Currently, the Chinese army is blocking the enemy on one side, and another unit is flanking the Japanese rear, and the Japanese situation is imminent. (Telegraph dispatch from Washington on the 31st)

Xingji - More than a thousand Japanese troops west of Yangcheng, along the Yangmeng Road and the areas on both sides, harassed the areas of Jiangcun, Weijiapao, and Nanren Village.

Chinese Troops Reclaim Mountainous Area Southeast of Qinshui

Xingji - After Xianweng Mountain, southeast of Qinshui, was recovered by the Chinese on the 27th, there were continued advances on the 28th and 29th.

London: The Army Department bulletin released today strongly praised the small number of British troops stationed in Calais for their heroic defense over several days under enemy air raids and shelling. It stated that their refusal to surrender provided immense assistance to the main force of the British Expeditionary Force withdrawing towards Dunkirk. The objective of this small unit of British troops was twofold: first, to defend Calais, and second, to maintain communication with the British Expeditionary Force. Later realizing that it could not resist the powerful German mechanized units, it concentrated its efforts on defending Calais. Although the enemy repeatedly attacked and continuously bombed and shelled, the defending troops held out for several days without being breached. (Reuters dispatch, 31st)

Frontline Warfare in Flanders is Exceptionally Fierce

German Army Uses Forty Divisions to Participate

London: A Reuters military correspondent reported that the German forces participating in the Flanders campaign consist of forty divisions, supplemented by remaining mechanized units. The distinction between these two types of units is particularly important, as the entire German army is not mechanized. Its mechanized armored divisions are extremely strong, while the majority is still infantry, with its organization similar to that of 1914. Eighty percent of the transportation vehicles in the army are still horse-drawn. Currently, it is this type of infantry that is fighting on the Flanders front. Yesterday, the German army launched two major offensives. The first was from east to west, attacking Nieuwpoort from Veurne, and the second was from south to Dunkirk, aiming to occupy the famous ridges of Kemmelberg, Mont des Cats, and the small hills of Cassel. Both offensives were extremely fierce. The German army attacked in groups, so it suffered significant losses. According to reports, the German army originally intended to take it without a fight, but unexpectedly encountered such resistance. Fortunately, due to the large amount of water, the area around Dunkirk was reduced, giving the Allied forces the opportunity to strengthen their defenses. The British Air Force's fierce bombing to cover the Allied retreat has been widely praised. It is rumored that General Prioux, commander of the French First Army, who has been reported captured, has established immortal fame in this battle. After the surrender of the Belgian army, the situation seemed hopeless, but he dealt with it with extraordinary courage and determination, ultimately allowing the remaining troops to avoid damage and reach Dunkirk. His achievements deserve the highest respect. (Reuters dispatch, 31st)

Tank Battles Between French and German Armies

Independent Combat Situation for Two Weeks

London: A Reuters correspondent recently interviewed French tank units in France and learned about the repeated independent combat situations between French and German tank units over the past two weeks. Currently, the fighting in that area has developed into trench warfare. Although the German army has repeatedly launched group offensives, one of our infantry divisions has stopped two German divisions from advancing. Since we arrived here, we have not lost an inch of ground. Tank warfare is a new type of tactic, similar to naval or air warfare. Enemy and our tank units have engaged in close-range fighting, conducting flanking attacks, and opening fire within a few hundred yards. This type of battle ends in a few minutes, as even tanks can hardly withstand such close-range firepower for long. A young lieutenant also recounted how the heavy tank he led destroyed twelve German light tanks. One day, as his heavy tank was crossing a small hill, he saw twelve German tanks on the road advancing. The German side, limited by the terrain, could not flank him, so he was able to charge straight ahead and destroy them one by one. French tank drivers search for enemies and participate in combat, often having to remain in the vehicle for up to six hours, and must refuel in the battlefield. According to French generals, French infantry were initially stunned by German air attacks, but once they discovered that they could shoot down low-flying German aircraft with rifles, they no longer cared and began to do so, shooting down as many as twenty German aircraft within ten days.

German Offensive Has Approached the National Border

Britain Intensifies Prevention of the Fifth Column

London: Mr. Littell, an official of the British Labor Supply Bureau, also shouted loudly during a speech: "Hitler and his henchmen have reached our national border. In a few months, our country's fate may be unimaginable!" Mr. Littell strongly stated that there must be German spy organizations within Britain, whose terror is no less than that of Belgium, Norway, Denmark, and the Netherlands at the time. Since yesterday, many workers in British factories have been arrested on suspicion of sabotage. (United Press dispatch, 31st)

London: Today, the government continued its preparations to deal with invasion. Five unimplemented actions were implemented today to combat any possible fifth column activities. These five actions include: (1) Conducting large-scale searches for weapons, ammunition, and military uniforms at wharves and warehouses along the Thames River. (2) Removing all advertising pillars and road signs that could be used by paratroopers. (3) Ordering all golf courses to destroy the surface of the course to prevent paratroopers from landing. (4) Training munitions workers to use rifles and machine guns to protect factories. (5) The head of the air defense team, Nad, was placed under surveillance because his wife was German. Nad has been placed under police surveillance today. (United Press dispatch, 31st)

London: The British Minister to the Netherlands, Land, broadcast last night that Germany may still have insidious weapons that will shock us, so the people of the country should intensify preventative measures to resist the danger of Germany's fifth column and troop transport aircraft. The danger of troop transport aircraft is far greater than that of paratroopers or fifth column elements. German troop transport aircraft have landed thousands of German soldiers and howitzers in the Netherlands. If the Dutch authorities had not taken thorough precautions, it would have been easy for thousands more German soldiers to land on key roads in the Netherlands, and the war could have ended in twenty-four hours. He did not want to be alarmist, but it is necessary to intensify measures to counter this danger. Countless places in England can land German soldiers and guns. (Reuters dispatch, 31st)

### Sudden Collapse of Mine in Kyushu, Japan

Tokyo: A mine in the Kyushu coal mining area suddenly collapsed yesterday. Fifty-two miners were trapped, of whom thirteen have been rescued. The rest are feared to have no hope of survival. The cause of the accident is said to be that workers in the new mine made a mistake in the direction of excavation and broke through the old mine's water-retaining wall, causing the entire mine to be flooded. When the mine collapsed, the nearby ground also collapsed, and about one hundred houses were destroyed. After the incident, local rescue groups immediately mobilized to rescue the affected people.

### Arita Predicts the End of the European War is Not Far Off; Japan's Success or Failure Hinges on It; Directives to Overseas Envoys to Pay Attention

Tokyo: The Miyako Shimbun recently reported that Foreign Minister Arita issued directives to envoys stationed in various countries on the 28th of this month, stating that the current European war may soon be declared over in a short period of time. If so, even if the United States does not intervene on a large scale in East Asia, the time for resolving various issues around the world should be no later than the autumn of this year. This may lead to a serious situation for Japan. "The key to the success or failure of the East Asian New Order lies here. In order to resolve the China Incident and cope with the changing international situation, our country should take effective steps in a timely manner. Although our country's fundamental policy is not to get involved in the whirlpool of the European war, whether this policy can complement our policy of establishing a 'New Order in East Asia' or whether it will be counterproductive depends on how our envoys stationed abroad respond. Therefore, these envoys must prepare for various steps in advance." The newspaper also added a commentary stating that the Foreign Minister's issuance of this directive shows his determination to work hard to resolve the "China Incident" and to prepare to freely implement world policies after the current European war ends.

Chongqing: The Central Daily News recently published Madame Sun Yat-sen's speech, stating that as a result of three years of resistance, the nationalistic concept of the people throughout the country has become more consolidated. Although the coastal provinces of China have been occupied, China still possesses a vast land with abundant natural resources and manpower, which is enough to make the Chinese people believe that they can eventually achieve victory. In the current dangerous period, all parties and factions have recognized the necessity of unity. The Japanese rumor of party splits is nothing more than the Japanese's dream.

### Under the Threat of Japanese Aircraft, Chongqing's Agencies Continue to Work as Usual

Chongqing: Since May 20th, Japanese aircraft have been attacking Chongqing every day. Today, there is rainfall here, so they cannot come here to wreak havoc. Japanese aircraft attack day and night, causing the public's nerves to be extremely strained. Although government agencies are in a difficult situation, they continue to work as usual. Chinese newspapers unanimously appealed to the United States to put pressure on Japan to stop bombing undefended cities and towns, because if the United States stops supplying gasoline and scrap iron, Japanese aircraft will be at their wit's end.

### Background of the European War: "Failure of a Mission" - Abridged Translation of Sir Nevile Henderson's Original Work

Regarding the background of this European war, the British government has already published Blue Books and White Books, and has made many speeches in Parliament to clarify the British position. Sir Nevile Henderson, the British ambassador to Germany, spent three months writing "Failure of a Mission" after returning home in September of last year. It narrates rich character sketches and tortuous negotiations. This book, written by a pro-German Englishman, proves Germany's unwisdom on the one hand, and proves the shortsightedness of England and its ambassadors on the other hand, leading to Britain's historical awakening today. It will thoroughly clarify the causes of this war and the policies of Britain and Germany, and anyone who cares about the modern situation will definitely want a copy.

The author is a fifty-seven-year-old bachelor who has neither spoken in Parliament nor published any works. It was not until the British Blue Book published his repeated reports that his talents were admired, giving the impression of a sudden success. In the diplomatic world, he was also very ordinary, and it was only after thirty years that he served as Minister to Yugoslavia. From Mussolini's conquest of Abyssinia to Hitler's recovery of the Rhineland, until the Spanish War, he was serving as ambassador to Argentina, 7,000 miles away from his home country. In January 1937, he was promoted to Ambassador to Germany. He said very modestly, "Being ordered to maintain world peace is almost an act of providence." Like Chamberlain, he had great confidence in this mission to promote Anglo-German understanding.

In the end, he was wrong, and he knew he was tragically wrong, so he named his book "Failure of a Mission." He did not begin to seriously doubt until Chamberlain's first meeting with Hitler in Godesberg, Germany, in September 1938, and he did not realize he was wrong until the German annexation of Czechoslovakia in March of last year. But he still agreed with Chamberlain that it was not an inappropriate policy to do one's best and leave the rest to fate until the worst situation proved that he was truly wrong.

After the German occupation of Czechoslovakia, war was unavoidable, but Sir Nevile Henderson concluded that if Hitler had not been driven by lust for power and misled by pro-war factions on his left and right, war might not have broken out. He believed that if Hitler had been willing to consider it carefully, Danzig and the Polish Corridor could have been returned to Germany. But Hitler was "insatiably greedy." In the end, this most pro-German envoy became Germany's mortal enemy. The preface to the book says, "Hitler never believed that the final outcome would escape war." If Sir Nevile Henderson had known this earlier, his book might not have been titled "Failure of a Mission."

The original book is very long. The newspaper's reporter has translated the essence of the book below for readers.

In January 1937, while serving as ambassador to Argentina, I was ordered to transfer to Berlin as ambassador. At the end of March, I returned to London, stayed for a month, and made arrangements for new matters. I was too busy to rest. It was especially important to talk with Chamberlain, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who was already slated to succeed as Prime Minister, about the plan for Germany. In the end, it was decided that after arriving in Berlin, I would work hard to negotiate with Hitler and the Nazi Party.

The general policy indicated by Mr. Chamberlain was in perfect harmony with my personal views. During my tenure, I was able to faithfully fulfill it without any obstacles, until the painful last moment, when the overall situation was beyond saving. I realized that at the time, public opinion still regarded those who openly attempted to cooperate with the Hitler government as heretics, so I presented it to Mr. Chamberlain, and I was allowed to have a little discretion after arriving in Berlin. Mr. Chamberlain immediately replied that conscious discretion is sometimes particularly beneficial to diplomacy, and its value has already been experienced recently.

This mission was expressed at the beginning of my new tenure. One month after arriving in Berlin, the German-British Association held a banquet to entertain me. Many important figures from the Nazi Party were present, and I used the discretion given to me by Mr. Chamberlain to deliver a pro-German speech. One of the remarks stated that if the British ignored the Nazi dictatorship and instead focused on the country's large-scale social undertakings, it would be more beneficial to the overall situation. The British left-wing press was shocked by this and dubbed me "the Nazi Party's British Ambassador to Germany." I didn't care at all.

I arrived in Berlin on April 30, 1937. On May 1st, Labor Day, meetings were held everywhere to celebrate, and most of the programs were speeches by important figures. I had the first opportunity to see Hitler's splendor and to listen to his speech in person. At that time, I had not yet presented my credentials, so I went to the German Opera House on that day as a private citizen to visit the Labor Day celebrations. Although Hitler also attended, the speaker was Propaganda Minister Goebbels. The theme was art and literature, and I was impressed by his fluent wording and clear pronunciation. He did not mention politics, and the malicious, sophistry, and deception that he usually used in propaganda were thus discarded.

I then went to Lustgarten Park, where I saw a sea of people standing in formation. After Dr. Ley, the leader of the Labor Front, delivered the opening remarks, Hitler followed with a speech. Although he slightly ridiculed England and other democratic countries, he mainly focused on attacking the power of Jews in the Soviet Union.

What I was paying attention to at this time was the psychology of the individual and the crowd, which was more important than the remarks of the important figures. When I was Minister to Yugoslavia, I listened to Hitler's repeated speeches by radio. I felt that his pronunciation was turbid and his wording was harsh, but his encouragement of the people of the country was a special strength, and the listeners were all convinced.

When I returned, I thought, what is Hitler's greatness? How did he become the leader of a great nation, with no one daring to compete with him? What kind of potential power did he hold to control his subordinates? This question lingered in my mind throughout my tenure in Germany. In fact, he is the same as all the incredible leaders in history. What he wants to do is to "shape the destiny of a nation, for better or for worse, and to suddenly show his violent power to subdue the world." The man was abnormal, but so was the entire German nation after 1918.

National Socialism is a kind of revolution. Hitler has a special strength that other revolutionaries do not have, and that is his firm belief. He believed in his country, believed in his mission to Germany, and believed in his own greatness. In addition to faith, he also had a strong will. Once, I saw him inspecting the party for four hours, always raising his right hand in the party salute, standing still. Afterwards, I asked him how he did it. He replied, "Willpower alone." His administrative talent is not as good as Mussolini's, but once the direction is set, he can always devote all his efforts until the plan is completed. In the first year of my tenure, I often asked the people around Hitler what he was afraid of. They all replied that it was in his "sense of his fingertips," meaning that he was quick to recognize opportunities, had sharp eyes and quick hands, and had clear goals. The example is that in 1936, despite the warnings of the General Staff and trusted advisors, he recovered the Rhineland.

Commentators often refer to Hitler by various bizarre nicknames. From my personal point of view, he actually has a dual personality. Initially, he was a talented visionary or a practical dreamer, believing in his own ambition to revive Germany. However, like all dictators, after reaching the height of power, he often lost his sense of moderation. Napoleon was like this, and so was Hitler. When I first met him, I was deeply moved by his precise reasoning and understanding of reality. Over time, I gradually felt that he was less reasonable and increasingly arrogant. In the end, I felt that he was not as good as Bismarck, and that Ribbentrop was the second Iron-Blooded Prime Minister.

I never had the opportunity to see Hitler's personal life in a public place, which was a great regret. Apart from occasionally exchanging a few words of greeting, I always met him during formal negotiations, and the topics discussed were often unpleasant problems for each other. He never attended informal banquets; even if there was an opportunity, he always made excuses to avoid approaching me. At one point, he often received foreign guests, but later he gradually distanced himself. He did not trust diplomats and hated informal contacts. The greater the person, the greater the self-esteem, because if he deigned to contact ordinary people, he would lose his dignity. Hitler seemed to have deeply understood this secret.

The Author's Conversation with Goebbels

I presented my credentials to Hitler the day before King George VI's coronation. The Hindenburg airship crashed, and there were rumors of sabotage. Hitler was furious. Whenever I met him, he was always in a state of emotional indignation, which was due to fate. When I presented my credentials, we exchanged short greetings, but there was no interest. When I expressed my condolences for the destruction of the Hindenburg, he invited me to a separate room to talk. His attitude was still good, but I still didn't know where his power to control Germany came from.

Most Germans, especially women, talked to me about how Hitler's attractiveness was in his radiant appearance and bright eyes. From my point of view, his eyes were often red with anger, which was perhaps my misfortune in formal places. But I dare say that although no one can ignore Hitler's achievements, I never had any great impression of him. He had an incredible magic power over his people, but I was never moved. When he was in agreement, he could often convince me with his sound reason. When he was indignant, I could only beg him to calm down. His attitude was dignified and courteous, but I still didn't understand how he maintained his position. In my opinion, Germans like to be ruled by autocrats, and the Party has already honored him as the leader, so they should support him to avoid destroying the Party. (To be continued)

### International Track and Field Meet Opens This Afternoon; Competition Begins at 2 PM at Shanghai American School; Nine Chinese and Western Groups Compete for the Championship

The 1940 Open Group Track and Field Meet, organized by the Shanghai International Track and Field Association, is scheduled to open at 2 PM this afternoon at the Shanghai American School track and field grounds on Avenue Petain. The meet will last two days, with the second day scheduled for next Saturday (the 8th) at the same location. A total of nine Chinese and Western groups will participate, including the Soviet Western Youth, Macklin, School Alliance, Western Police, Jewish, Peide, Western Foss, and Dong Selai. The number of participating units is the same as last year, but the French Army, Portuguese, Russian Army, and Lido teams will not participate this year. The participants of the newly formed Huichang team will consist of members from Selai, Western Foss, Jewish, and Western Police teams. In fact, the thousand athletes still belong to their respective teams, such as the Russian Army being affiliated with the Western Police, and Lido merging with the China United team. As for the strength of each team, the defending champion, the Western Youth team, will be greatly affected this year due to Fonseca's transfer to the Western Police. Macklin, the runner-up last year, will also feel weakened by the absence of Finke, as both Fonseca and Finke each won four championships last year. Finke is currently on leave and will not be able to display his prowess this year. Fonseca, on the other hand, won six championships at the police spring games and is still in top form. Therefore, the Western Police have great ambition and confidence in winning the championship this year. As for our China United team, they unfortunately finished fourth last year due to dispersed strength. This year, they have consolidated their forces, and their strength has naturally increased. Although their recent friendly competition with the School Alliance did not reach its peak, it has already revealed their potential. Li Zhenzhong's hurdles, Wu Bixian's high jump, and Wang Zhenglin's one-mile and two-mile races are all very promising. However, in the sprints, they may not be able to match Fonseca and Edward's dominance. Zhang Jianao's inability to participate due to illness will at least result in the China United team losing many points. As for who will win the overall championship, it is difficult to predict due to personnel changes in each unit. Looking ahead, the Western Police, with their rising strength, have a better chance, while the China United team, with their balanced talent, also has a great desire to win. Today's schedule includes a total of thirteen events, with five finals and the rest being preliminary and semi-final rounds. Four athletes will be selected for each final, three athletes for each preliminary round, and four athletes for each semi-final round. Scoring will be based on a 5-3-2-1 system, with relay races being doubled. (10) (12) 4x110 yard relay (final) 4:10 PM (10) (13) 880-yard relay (preliminary) 4:30 PM 75, Liang Shen, 76, Yongfu, 77, Zhou Yong, 78, Zhou Yaokang, 79, Ji Songen, 80, Hao Chunde, 81, Xu Chengliang, 82, Guan Youwen, 83, Guo Hengyao, 84, Li Zhenzhong, 85, Luo Rongze, 86, Ma Qingyuan, 87, Sun Huipei, 88 Tang Wenxiong, 89, Zhu Shaofei, 90, Wang Biyu, 91, Wang Xuewu, 92, Wang Zhenglin, 93, Zhang Zhenxing, 94, Wang Junwei, 96, Wang Zhenshi, 97, Yang Huanian, 98, Wu Bixian, 99, Ren Xiangcheng, 100 Wan Jinsheng.

### Overview of Central Government's Care for Refugee Children in the Past Three Years (Part 1); Over 30,000 Children Accommodated

(Chongqing Airmail) With the War of Resistance approaching its third year, the situation of refugee children being cared for has attracted much attention. Recently, Ms. Qian Yonghe, section chief of the Central Relief Committee, wrote a detailed report on the committee's relief efforts for refugees. The following is an excerpt of the facts regarding relief and care:

Relief Organizations: At the central level, there are 13 organizations including the Children's Care Home established by the Relief Committee, temporary children's care centers in various relief zones, children's reformatories, and infant nurseries. There are 52 refugee children relief groups, including the China Philanthropic Child Association, orphanages, care homes, and philanthropic institutions established by international friends entrusted by the Shanghai occupied area and various places in the rear. The Wartime Child Care Association has established 46 nurseries in various provinces and cities, and six institutions where the association has requested foreign churches to care for refugee children. The China Wartime Child Relief Association has established five care homes in Hubei, Sichuan, and Eastern provinces. The Hankou Refugee Children Education Committee established the Xikang Children's Care Home in Chongqing, which has now been merged into another institution. In addition, there are 214 institutions established by public and private entities in various provinces and cities (excluding refugee children care homes established by other relief groups that have not yet been identified). Each institution has full-time instructors, caregivers, doctors, and nurses in addition to the director and head, providing both education and care.

Relief Situation: During the first phase of the War of Resistance, refugee children near the war zones were rescued by personnel from various refugee children relief groups, and the special commissioners of each relief zone of the Relief Committee and local refugee sub-stations assisted in receiving, transporting, and providing supplies. At that time, relief groups such as the Wartime Child Care Association, the China Philanthropic Child Association, and the China Wartime Child Relief Association divided the work into zones such as "along the Jinghu (Beijing-Shanghai) and Qian (Qiantang River) and Zhejiang," "Northern Anhui, Southern Hebei, Northern Jiangsu," "Southern Anhui, Jiangsu and Zhejiang border," "Western Shandong, Eastern Henan, Hebei and Southern Hebei," "Northern Henan, Eastern Shanxi," "Suiyuan, Chahar, Northern Shanxi, Northern Shaanxi," "Western Henan, Eastern Shaanxi, Southern Shanxi," and "Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Hankou" to carry out relief work. During the second phase of the War of Resistance, the locations for rescuing refugee children were re-designated, and the China Philanthropic Child Association, the Wartime Child Care Association, the China Wartime Child Relief Association, the Hankou Refugee Children Education Committee, and the Chongqing Municipal Government divided the work into zones such as "Shanxi, Shaanxi, Henan, Hubei," "Central Hubei, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Guangxi, and surrounding areas," "Hunan, Jiangxi," "along the Yangtze River," and "Chongqing City (relief for refugee children and orphans)" to carry out relief separately. After refugee children are rescued from the front lines, they are taken to temporary accommodation locations. If there are no suitable means to transport them to various provinces in the rear, temporary children's care centers are established in safe areas within the various relief zones of the Relief Committee, with a limit of 100 to 500 children. The center director, doctors, nurses, teachers, and other staff are responsible for education, medical care, and childcare. If a temporary care center cannot continue to operate due to the war, it will be closed according to the plan. Alternatively, if there is no local accommodation for those rescued from the front lines, the refugee children must be transported to the rear for accommodation and care, and handled in accordance with the Relief Committee's transportation regulations. According to statistics, the government and refugee children relief groups have accommodated more than 30,000 children in their children's education, care, and philanthropic institutions.

After the opening, some silver shops, gold shops, and retail investors bought, leading to an upward trend, soaring to the 60 yuan mark, but were forced back by limited sales. It was difficult to break through. Afterwards, speculative longs were unable to acquire more goods and hurriedly closed their positions, while buyers gradually decreased at this time. By noon, the closing price had returned to 5,935 yuan. The market situation in the afternoon was quite good. After the opening, buying interest was high, and silver shops and Hong Kong investors entered, further pushing it up to 5,985 yuan. Soon, trading became light, and a small number of retail silver shops made intraday closures. As a result, it closed at 5,950 yuan, an increase of 45 yuan compared to the previous night's close.

At the same time, gold shops also acquired based on the above price. Subsequently, due to continued acquisition by gold shops, and a certain silver shop buying on behalf of Hong Kong investors, the upward trend was still slow. However, sellers gradually decreased, and gold shops greatly increased their acquisition, so it soared by dozens of yuan. Silver shops and money changers traded a total of fifty taels, for 5,975 yuan. Subsequently, money changers forcefully sold over 200 taels, immediately seeing a small return of 25 yuan. Gold shops sold thirty taels to silver shops, for 5,950 yuan.

Money changers and silver shops sold a total of one hundred taels to gold shops and silver shops, both transactions were for 6,000 yuan. However, at that time, the above-mentioned limited sales were still in place, and the upward trend was blocked, making it difficult to break through the 6,000 yuan mark. Before long, gold shops lowered the price to sell, and it went down again. When it retreated to 5,960 yuan, most speculative longs who were unable to acquire more goods had to reluctantly close their positions, and the overnight position was greatly expanded. Subsequently, it saw a decline of 20 yuan, with an order to sell ten taels to silver shops, for 5,930 yuan. Then, silver shops traded thirty taels among themselves, for 5,935 yuan as the noon closing price. In the afternoon, buyers crowded in, opening 25 yuan higher.

However, Hong Kong cables aggressively acquired, although Chinese banks sold, the overnight position was not large, causing the price to soften. Later, Japanese banks came to sell, and American banks and others were willing to acquire, so the situation could not be eased. By noon closing, the American exchange rate was the tightest, reporting 5.5 yuan. The prior order was for 4 pence 1/125. There was very little discussion about trading in the afternoon.

### Foreign Currencies Rebound

The market prices increased uniformly. The supply and demand for British gold tickets were balanced, and the market price was stable. The American and British pound tickets eventually rose above the 18 yuan mark due to the tightening of the black market American exchange rate.

The interbank lending rate of the Money Dealers' Association fell by 2 fen, and both the morning and afternoon markets were quoted at 2.5 jiao.

### Securities; Domestic Bonds See Upward Trend Again

Yesterday's unofficial securities market situation rebounded and tended to be firm again. Although trading was not very smooth, the buying interest was stronger than the selling interest. It is rumored that foreign exchange arbitrage matters will likely disappear invisibly in the future. This large portion of floating capital will inevitably be shocked and have nowhere to go. In other words, monetary conditions will inevitably tend to ease, and public bonds will also gradually become active as a result. The trend was flat and tired in the morning, and firm in the afternoon. Trading was light in the afternoon. Tongkang bought, and Lianhe sold slightly. In the afternoon, Lianhe switched from selling to buying, and Lianyi also had demand. On the selling side, there were only sporadic retail investors. The market price settled and was slightly better by about 1 jiao. The turnover was still only over 300,000 yuan. A simple table is listed below:

Stock Trading: 30 shares of Ning Shao Steamship Company were traded, for 13.5 jiao.

Foreign Stocks: There was only half-day trading yesterday, with 220,000 shares traded. The price was exceptionally stable. The closing of positions by weekend speculators was not significant, and those who shorted had probably already covered their positions before. Therefore, the rise and fall were minimal. Industrial stocks and rubber stocks were in the same situation.

London, 30th (Thursday) Telegraph, today's listed prices of stocks of British companies in the Far East continued to weaken. Jardine Matheson Bank shares fell 2 shillings and 6 pence, to 8.5 pounds.

London, 30th (Thursday) Telegraph, today's listed prices of Chinese foreign debt remained stable. There were no changes in the upper and lower grade bonds.

### Rubber Stock Dividends Again

At the same time, the final dividend for the year ending March 1940 will be distributed, at 8 jiao per share, plus the first and second interim dividends, each at 2 jiao per share, for a total of 1.20 yuan per share for the year.

### Yarn and Cotton; Sales Order Has Passed; Yarn Market Stagnates

The yarn market is still mediocre, and the trend is dim. This is because the actual demand has entered a stagnant path, so the market sentiment has softened. However, the public's goals are still optimistic, so the market does not leave the hovering state.

The spot yarn market opened this morning due to the lingering rumors of instability in the yarn firms, so the market situation stagnated. 20-count Shuangma opened at 1,300 yuan, and then gradually fell to 1,272 yuan. However, multiple parties came to acquire when it fell, and it recovered to 1,292 yuan. It is estimated that the turnover for half a day was 1,360 bales, and the price of 20-count Shuangma fell by 3 yuan. Today, 880 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong. The amount bought by each trade is listed below:

Ningbo 45, same trade 1,130

Hong Kong 185, Total 1,360

### Low Inventory; Spot Cotton Prices Difficult to Loosen

The cotton trade has slightly improved, but factory demand is not strong. Qingdao buyers have slightly expanded, so the market sentiment is still flat. However, the selling prices are extremely mediocre. The details of the spot cotton transactions are listed below:

In other news, the foreign cotton market prices, New York cotton, yesterday was a holiday, and the entire US market was closed for one day. The Indian cotton market, due to the retreat of the Allied forces, the market sentiment was panicked, so it fell by a huge 8 rupees yesterday, including forecasts.

The Shanghai foreign cotton trade was very quiet. All parties intended to spend the end of the month quietly, so the transactions were very few. The current spot inventory is low, so the selling prices of spot goods have not been loosened after all. The following lists the factory prices for the futures market yesterday, converted at an exchange rate of 5.5 yuan per US dollar:

### Piece Goods - Winter and Summer Woolen Cloth, Differing Tempo

Yesterday, the market price of woolen cloth, for the upcoming autumn and winter forward contracts yet to reach the sales season, such as dark-colored serge, Harris tweed, overcoating, shoe felt, plain thick cloth, Melton, riding breeches cloth, and camel hair brocade, etc., all showed significant price increases and were sought after. Traders regarded them as rare commodities. This was because the stock in Shanghai was already low, the European war was protracted, transportation was difficult, and people were optimistic about the future. Recently, white serge, white broadcloth, feather yarn cloth, Panama cloth, paladin, thick-skinned linen cloth, Cheviot cloth, Vandyke silk feather yarn, and the like, which are needed for current sales, were mostly flat. This was because the local merchant guilds had already prepared them. Now, they mostly added them according to customer needs, and the wholesale prices were not lowered, so the actual transactions were not as active as the forward winter goods.

Also, today there were fourteen pieces of piece goods shipped to Hong Kong, one hundred and twenty pieces shipped to Tianjin, and eighty-five pieces shipped to Yantai.

### Food - Foreign Rice Sales Surge

After the rice market took a sharp turn downwards, hovered several times, and then presented a stable situation again for several consecutive days, it seemed that there would be no more violent fluctuations in the short period before this holiday, depending on the situation of futures. However, the market is ever-changing and always surprises people. Yesterday, there was a sudden large transaction, breaking the silence of the past two weeks and showing signs of movement. Generally, domestic customers, such as those in Zhejiang Province, were experiencing food shortages and needed to respond urgently, intending to purchase freely. However, because they were aware that the market was often volatile and difficult to predict, they did not dare to act rashly and only quietly watched for market opportunities, making slight purchases. Therefore, yesterday, not only customers from the Hangzhou, Shaoxing, and Ningbo guilds in Zhejiang Province and the Suzhou-Jiaxing area actively searched, but also the Fujian and Guangdong guilds from the South Seas purchased freely from each other, and the local shops also participated, making it the most active sales of the year. The market rose all the way from morning to closing, without any decline. As a result, the closing price was more than one yuan higher than the previous day.

Foreign rice sales were very active yesterday. The Hangzhou oil and other guilds purchased more than 4,000 bags of near rice, the Ningbo guild purchased more than 2,000 bags of No. 2 Saigon rice, and other domestic areas in this street also inquired about it. Therefore, a total of more than 10,000 bags were sold. After the opening price in the morning, because the customer demand was active, it was difficult to set new prices, and the market rose step by step. The most traded "Little Twist" rose from 48.35 yuan to 49.10 yuan. Later, the market was slightly weaker due to high prices, and floating accounts sold out, causing the market to soften, closing at 49 yuan, about half a yuan higher than the previous day. Other similar items also saw gains. No. 2 Western goods returned in the original packaging were inquired about by the Ningbo guild, with the price rising from 62.60 yuan to 63 yuan. There were several batches of No. 1 Siamese Late rice negotiated, including 1,600 tons at a price of 56.75 yuan, which could only be finalized if there was a ship available.

The arrival of domestic rice such as thick and thin粳 rice has been limited in recent days, and the market price in the producing areas continues to increase, so while Western rice is surging, rumors outside the market make people even more confident. Generally, cargo owners regard their goods as rare commodities, trying their best to hold on, and the customers are also eager to buy, not deterred by the high prices, making the transaction very active. Therefore, Changshu's Qing Te粳 rice was once quoted at 56 yuan, but the actual opening price was 55 yuan. Changkun's Te粳 rice was determined from 53-54 yuan to 51-52 yuan, old stock was around 50 yuan, Qingsi's Zhen Te thin rice was 54 yuan, then 51-52 yuan, and Nangang's early rice was 51 yuan to 50 yuan. The quoted price was 18.5 yuan to 48 yuan.

Only four or five carts of glutinous rice arrived, and the sales market initially followed the 粳 rice and saw activity, so the selling price was also high. The opening price of Jinli Special was 45.5 yuan to 45 yuan, Changdan white was 43-44 yuan, and Jiangbei white was around 41 yuan. In short, yesterday the price of 粳 glutinous domestic rice rose by one yuan along with foreign rice.

### Flour Market Stabilized - Wuxi New Wheat Has Entered the Market

Yesterday, the flour market was unremarkable. Except for scattered daily needs in this street, occasional customer inquiries were only a minor transaction. The No. 2 flour mill's price was still 13.8 yuan, while the customer price was 15 yuan, with some discrepancy in the dark. The total number of transactions in the market, including those of local customers, was about 7,000 to 8,000 bags. The supply and demand of miscellaneous domestic flour were not enthusiastic. It was heard that the Shunfeng brand was priced at 13.65 yuan, and the market was also unremarkable. Other brands had no regular market, and the trading of old brands was quiet, and the situation was once again stagnant. There was no market for wheat.

Wuxi wheat has a good harvest and has now entered the market. Forty to fifty bags of new wheat from Caishi arrived the day before yesterday, the first batch of new goods to Wuxi this year, purchased by the Minfeng Flour Mill for 33 yuan per bag. Old wheat was sold for 34.34 yuan per bag, and the current price of flour is 13.89 yuan per bag. There are more than 10,000 bags of flour in stock citywide. (Good)

### Miscellaneous Grains - Minhang New Broad Beans, Opening Price More Than Double Last Year's

New broad beans are on the market, five or six days earlier than last year. The 40-odd bags of small-grained white-skinned broad beans from Wuhu that arrived the day before yesterday were reportedly already being sold secretly at a price of around 15 yuan. Thirty-eight bags of new green-skinned broad beans from Minhang also arrived yesterday morning, with good color and quality. They were distributed by retailers in this street at a price of 19.5 yuan, more than double the opening price last year (the opening price on June 5, 1928, was 7.2 yuan). The subsequent supply is not weak. According to traders, it is feared that the second round of price increases will not be easy to maintain. However, the custom of rushing for new goods depends on the supply and demand situation.

### Sugar Market - Raw and White Sugar Steps Up

Yesterday, the sugar market was because Dutch raw white sugar must be calculated based on the US dollar, and the sales in the north were quite active, so the association's price continued to rise. The spot price of 24 raw white sugar from foreign warehouses was initially 70 yuan, then rose to 0.35 yuan to 0.8 yuan, an increase of 1.6 yuan. The re-export price was initially 56.5 yuan to 57 yuan, then rose to 57.23 yuan to 45 yuan. Hong Kong goods were 57 yuan, up 2 yuan. Taikoo refined white sugar B mark was 80.5 yuan to 81 yuan, up 1 yuan, H mark crude red sugar was 58 yuan, and Dutch red sugar was 61 yuan, both up 1 yuan. There were still no transactions in domestic sugar, and it is expected that there will be a regular market after the holiday. Also, 2,000 bags of sugar were shipped to Tianjin.

### North and South Goods - Xianglian Softens Back

Xianglian was previously active in Hong Kong, and the lotus seeds from this lake were once sold for 200 yuan. However, recently, with the exchange rate loosening, the trend has softened. The current market price has fallen to 190 yuan. It is heard that Jiuxi lotus seeds are slightly opened at 170 yuan. Top white lotus seeds are still sold for 190 yuan, and the market is not showing signs of loosening. Ordinary ones range from 140 to 150 yuan.

### Silk and Tea - Cocoon Merchants Establish Factories in the Interior - But After Silk is Made, a Transit Tax is Still Required

The Zhejiang cocoon market, Jiaxing, is also about to be completed. Local raw silk is priced at 150 yuan, and improved silk is priced at 200 yuan, which is better than other regions, because the arrival of goods in Jiaxing is more active. This year, silk cocoon merchants, in view of the transportation difficulties of spring cocoons last year, have opened small silk factories in the interior. However, the transportation of silk after it is made is said to require a "tax" of 250 yuan per load before it can be released. In that case, if one load of raw silk is equal to three loads of cocoons, each twist of cocoons will have to bear a "transit tax" of 83 yuan.

### Artificial Silk Transferred to Tianjin - Wuxi Cocoon Prices Trend Upwards

Artificial silk from the east has always been transported from North China, Dalian, and other places to Shanghai. Now, most of it is first transported to Hong Kong and then transferred to Shanghai. The intention is not known. Today, more than 500 bags of artificial silk were loaded onto Taikoo Shenjing and transported to Tianjin.

In Wuxi, the various orchid shops have successively opened their scales in the past two days. Many villagers are carrying cocoons for sale, and the price is expected to be as high as 350 yuan. The price of inferior goods is lower. The market in the south has exceeded the limit. The cocoon shops in neighboring Yixing, Yang, Wujin, and Jiangyin counties will also open their scales today and tomorrow. There are many small cocoon collectors in the four townships of Xixian County, with a small amount of capital, renting houses and setting up stoves, totaling several thousand places. The market price of mulberry leaves has fallen to 15 yuan because new cocoons have been listed.

Thirteen packages of tea were shipped to Hong Kong today.

### Coal - Wenzhou Charcoal Will Arrive

Wenzhou Grade A charcoal, due to the interruption of supply a week ago, charcoal merchants took the opportunity to secretly bid as high as 11 yuan per unit. Recently, because Wenzhou has resumed shipping, the subsequent goods will arrive soon, so the group of traders and merchants are all releasing their stock, and the price has fallen by more than one yuan as they rush to sell. Other settlement goods also consistently carry a small price of eight or nine corners.

### Hardware - Deformed Steel Bars Remain Fixed

The transaction of deformed steel bars has not been smooth recently, because the amount paid by the out-of-town customers is small, and the purchase by the local construction gangs is also not strong, so the market is not lively. However, the market price is still firm and high due to the same vegetable mindset. It is heard that the overseas supply of this cargo is also quite scarce, and the stock in this port is also low, resulting in the market price of 3/8" to 4/8" per ton still selling for 1,500 yuan, and 5/8" to coarse pattern selling for 1,450 yuan per ton. It is found that the transaction in yesterday's market was only more than 20 units.

### Advance the Clock One Hour

– South

There are different opinions on advancing the clock. If the purpose is to promote early rising and save daylight, there was originally a move to advance office hours in the summer. As long as the time is advanced, it is not necessary to change the time. Changing the time is inconvenient for the public's living habits. Secondly, it will be difficult to calculate this time in the future. Who knows that the time in this year will be advanced by one hour? If it is calculated according to the usual time in the future, it will be inaccurate. Furthermore, Shanghai time has a certain calculation with the time of various places in the world. In order to advance one hour, when calculating, it is necessary to add "one" or subtract "one", adding a kind of trouble and one more calculation in the mind. Moreover, people who sleep late will still sleep late, and people who get up early will still get up early without advancing the clock by one hour. If the working hours are extended, then the time is not wasted in the morning, but is spent at night! If it is thought that it can control the nightlife of Shanghai people, that is even more ridiculous. People who spend the night will still stay up all night and will not feel the impact at all.

The most regrettable thing is to deceive oneself. Clearly, it is an eight-hour work day, but the clock is advanced by one hour, insisting that the office hours are still 9 o'clock. The business hours were originally opened at 8 o'clock, but now 8 o'clock is changed to 7 o'clock with the clock advanced, which is still the same old thing. Instead of using the trick of "stealing the sky and changing the sun", it is better to honestly say that all working hours are advanced by one hour. However, there are two kinds of people who find it convenient. One is the Japanese. Originally, due to the longitude relationship, Japan is fifteen degrees east of Shanghai, so Japanese time is one hour earlier than Shanghai time. When it is 8 o'clock in Shanghai, it is already 9 o'clock in Japan. Now, advancing the clock by one hour is exactly the same as Japanese time. Not only is it convenient for the Japanese to calculate the time, but they are also very happy in their hearts. The second type is people who take the train. Originally, the time used by the train was Shanghai time. Since it was occupied by the Japanese, the time was also advanced by one hour to become Japanese time. Now, the concession advances one hour, which is the same as the Japanese time on the train, how convenient!

### Daylight Saving Time Promotion Swift - Universally Implemented Starting This Morning - Municipal Chamber of Commerce Issues Special Notice to Participate Unanimously - Customs and Post Office Advance Office Hours

Regarding the daylight saving time movement, since the authorities of the two concessions jointly promoted it, various agencies, public groups, schools, etc. in this port have responded unanimously. The Hong Kong government also implemented it simultaneously with Shanghai today. However, the post office's advance of office hours will be extended to the 3rd before implementation. The clock at the Customs House will not be changed due to various reasons. The news from various parties is recorded below:

Chamber of Commerce Notice - Follow Unanimously

The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce issued a notice yesterday, stating that the daylight saving time held by the Public Concession Bureau, starting from June 1, advances the clock by one hour. The bureau previously sent a letter to solicit opinions, and the chamber has replied in agreement. From now on, it will be implemented accordingly. It is hoped that all industries and businesses in the city will adhere to the principle of getting up early and resting early, cherish material resources, and follow unanimously. This notice, June 1, 29th year of the Republic of China.

Public Institutions - Advance Time

Shanghai Electric Power Company, Shanghai Tram Company, China General Omnibus Company, etc., in response to the daylight saving time movement, all advanced the clock by one hour starting at midnight yesterday. Shanghai Electric Power Company sets the start of office hours at 8:30 a.m. according to daylight saving time. The telephone company also implements the savings plan. Starting today, public buses and trams in both concessions will run according to the advanced time.

Chinese and Foreign Banks - Advance Office Hours

The Shanghai Banking Association issued a notice yesterday stating, "The daylight saving time movement has been resolved and implemented by the authorities of the two concessions, and the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce has also expressed its approval. Therefore, all commercial sectors in the area will advance their business hours by one hour. In order to maintain consistency, and with the consent of the Foreign Bankers' Association, it is approved that all banks will advance their business hours by one hour starting from June 1, and the clock will be advanced by one hour at midnight tonight (i.e., the new time will still be from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.). This is to be notified separately, hoping that you will check and implement it." Furthermore, the Shanghai Foreign Exchange Banking Association (i.e., the Foreign Bankers' Association) decided yesterday afternoon to support the daylight saving time movement. On June 1 (Saturday), the business hours will be from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. (i.e., the new time after advancing one hour, the exchange business hours will be from 9:30 a.m. to 12:00 p.m.). As for the business hours starting from Monday, a separate notice will be issued today after a full decision. Also, Mr. Huang Yuzhai, chairman of the China Economic Construction Promotion Association in Shanghai, advised the banking and money industries to advance their office hours. His letter stated that all banking and money industry offices should have access to sunlight, eliminate bacteria, and accelerate blood circulation, which is beneficial to the body and indescribable. If we can make every effort to promote it, not only will time and material resources be in line with economic principles, but it will also be directly related to the evolution of society and indirectly strengthen the country, which is truly beneficial and without any harm.

Money Shops Hold Meetings - Money Exchange Follows

The business hours of the members of the Money Industry Association were originally from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. today, and will remain the same. The issue of advancing one hour may be raised for discussion at the executive committee meeting at 2:00 p.m. today. Also, a reporter inquired from the Money Exchange Industry Association yesterday that the foreign banks have actually advanced their exchange business hours by one hour, so the business hours of the members of the Money Exchange Industry Association will also be advanced by one hour.

Citizens' Federation - Advises Participation

The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation believes that daylight saving time promotes early rising, which is enough to stimulate vitality, improve work efficiency, and reduce consumption, which is beneficial to personal health, family economy, and social services. A special notice is issued to the citizens to follow the daylight saving plan of the Concession authorities and participate in the implementation unanimously, and has transferred orders to various branches to persuade them separately in order to achieve uniformity. Also, the Nanjing Road Business Community Association, in order to lead member businesses to participate in the daylight saving time movement and reduce electricity consumption, has also resolved through the association's committee to set the opening time at 9:00 a.m. and the closing time at 7:30 p.m. starting from June 1.

Customs House Clock - Does Not Change

According to the Jianghai Customs authorities yesterday, although the Customs authorities expressed their support for the daylight saving time movement, it is feared that advancing the clock will damage the machinery of the clock and affect various records related to time. Therefore, the Customs authorities decided yesterday (31st) not to implement the advancement of the clock. However, the office hours of the Jianghai Customs will be advanced by one hour starting today (1st). According to the original office hours of the Jianghai Customs, which were from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and from 2:00 p.m. to 4:30 p.m., they will be changed to 8:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. and from 1:00 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. starting today. Due to the change in the office hours of the Jianghai Customs, it is heard that the customs declaration industry, import and export industry, etc. in this city will also advance one hour at the same time starting today.

Post Office Office - Time Advanced

The Shanghai Postal Administration believes that the Post Office and the Customs have close connections in various businesses, and it is necessary to take the same steps for daylight saving time. Yesterday morning, the Postal Administration and the Customs had a meeting, but there was no result because the Customs insisted on not making changes. However, the Post Office's business is closely related to all kinds of businesses in the entire society, and since all sectors are following the new time, it is not convenient for the Post Office to be an exception. Therefore, the Postal Administration negotiated with the Customs authorities again yesterday afternoon, and both parties unanimously decided to advance the office hours by one hour in order to achieve consistent action with all sectors. However, advancing the clock is quite inconvenient in the Post Office's business and various records, so it could not be implemented. Also, due to various procedures, the Post Office's advance of office hours will begin on the 3rd of this month (Monday).

Curfew Time - All Parties Pay Attention

Regarding the Public Concession and the French Concession, which were originally from 12:30 a.m., it was heard yesterday that it will be changed to 1:30 a.m. according to the clock that has been advanced by one hour. However, when inquiring with the Police Department of the Public Concession, it was said that it will be from 12:30 a.m. according to the newly advanced time, which is the same as what the street patrol said. Also, the Observatory supports the principle of daylight saving time, but due to weather conditions, the radio reports on climate, etc. will still be the same and will not be advanced by one hour.

Western Newspapers Report - All Parties Respond

The English-language "Da Mei Evening News" reported that regarding the implementation of daylight saving time in Shanghai, starting from midnight today (31st), the clock will be advanced by one hour. According to a reporter's inquiry, most of the major businesses and banks in this city, except for a few, will make a final decision this afternoon. Managers of major cinemas may hold a meeting this afternoon to discuss changing the screening time. If the first-class cinemas decide to change the time, small theaters may follow suit. The Huiluo Company and the Sincere Company have decided to adopt daylight saving time, and other major department stores will also make a decision this afternoon and should adopt it unanimously. The American Express Bank must wait for the Bank Federation to make a decision this afternoon. Others such as the American Consulate, the American Court, the American President Shipping Company, and the Milk Company all agree. The British Court in China will make a decision today. The reporter also inquired from the Customs whether the Customs clock will be advanced by one hour, and was answered that the clock will not be advanced, but this issue will be discussed this afternoon. Travel agencies said that if the Customs clock is not advanced, they cannot change the time, but the office hours will be advanced by one hour. Also, telephone, tram, and bus companies have all announced the implementation of daylight saving time. According to Reuters, the office hours of foreign news agencies remain the same. As for the curfew that has been implemented since August 1937 due to political reasons, it will also be implemented according to daylight saving time starting on the 1st, shortening the nightlife by one hour.

### Japanese Atrocities at Qiujiang Wharf - Ten Employees of the Dredging Bureau Abused and Insulted by Japanese Soldiers

The Shanghai Dredging Bureau recently sent four engineers (one of whom was a Westerner) with thirty-six workers to work at the Qiujiang Wharf in Hongkou. At about 4:00 p.m. yesterday, Japanese soldiers newly transferred to the area inspected the passes of the Dredging Bureau engineers and workers, and a misunderstanding occurred, which angered the Japanese soldiers. They drove all the workers and engineers to one place and ordered all the workers to kneel on the ground and walk. The workers ignored them, and the Japanese soldiers used gun butts and fists to beat the workers. Two engineers and seven workers were injured on the spot, four of whom were seriously injured and their lives were in danger. At that time, the eyes of two of the workers were pierced and suffered serious internal injuries. Afterwards, these two workers were detained by the Japanese soldiers in the Japanese military headquarters. The injured were sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment by the bureau. The names of the injured are as follows: Engineer 3, Yin Qicheng (50 years old), local, injured in the face and ears, Gao Qizheng (29 years old), Changzhou, injured in the left ear, very serious, Ye Fuxiang (42 years old), Fujian, injured in the left and right waist by gun butts, the injury is very dangerous, Worker 5, Zhou Bairen (45 years old), Nanjing, injured in the face, Li Xiaorong (33 years old), Pudong, injured in the left waist, Li Shanji (45 years old), Ningbo, injured by gun butts, Chen Ahu (30 years old), Pudong, Sheng Xiaomao (32 years old, Pudong, both injured in the face,

### Public Concession Tram Company - Coppersmiths Go Slow

Last night, at the Copper Shop of the Public Concession Tram Company, Guankaier Road, five to six hundred workers, because of the high prices of everything and the difficulty of living, specially sent representatives to the company to request a 20% pay increase and a subsidy of 20 yuan. As a result of the negotiations between the representatives and the company, they did not get a satisfactory answer, and the workers implemented a go-slow.

### Obstacles to New Wheat Supply - High Flour Prices Persist - Transportation Issues Should Be Resolved Quickly

Recently, the weather has been fine, and new wheat has been listed one after another along the Shanghai-Nanjing Road, with dry and clean quality, no less than in previous years, and 70-80% of the harvest. There are also news of bumper harvests in various wheat-producing areas in northern Jiangsu and Anhui. However, in previous years, after the new wheat from various places was listed, Shanghai could also see the market at the same time, and the selling price of flour would immediately depreciate.

This year's new wheat

Has not arrived in Shanghai, and flour prices have remained high, which is far from the expectations of the citizens. According to the actual reason, it is because the purchase and transportation of the city's Chinese merchant firms has been held back by a certain party until now. The new wheat that Chinese factories have been waiting for for a long time is difficult to freely purchase and transport. If foreign wheat is used to make flour, the cost must be more than 15 yuan, according to

Current selling price

The difference is more than one yuan. Although the customers can appropriately increase the selling price, recently, in addition to being affected by the transportation of silver, they are also watching the market with the listing of new wheat. If they depreciate the price to sell, the loss will be too great. If they do not depreciate the price, they are afraid of being dumped by Japanese merchants and the flour from the occupied areas to Shanghai, so the situation

Difficulties

That is also the reason for the high flour prices. Therefore, the grain industry hopes that all parties will provide assistance to solve this transportation problem, which will not only support industry and commerce, but also greatly help all citizens.

### Negotiations on Extra-Boundary Road Donations and Taxes - The Bureau Proposes Representatives - It is Said that the New "Police Force" Will Be Established at the Beginning of the Month - Eight Gambling Dens Are Scheduled to Close at Midnight Yesterday - The Issue of Court Jurisdiction Is Closely Watched by All Parties

The English-language "Da Mei Evening News" reported that the Shanghai Municipal Council yesterday (30th) submitted the names of the Director-General and President Fei Lipu, the Deputy Director-General Ge Bo, and the Chief of the Finance Department Mu Qiu to the "Mayor" Chuan Xiao'an as the Council's representatives for future negotiations on donations and taxes in the extra-boundary road area. It can be seen that the agreement between the Municipal Council and the "Municipal Government" on the issue of extra-boundary roads is continuing to progress. The "Municipal Government" has not yet submitted the names of its representatives to participate in the tax discussion, but it is heard that its delegation will be headed by "Municipal Finance Commissioner" Zhou Wenrui. Now

Police Issues

Have not yet been agreed. Major Bowen, Chief of the Municipal Council's Police Department, sent out a draft at the beginning of this month and is currently awaiting a reply. However, according to reliable sources, the joint new police force will begin operations in the extra-boundary road area at the beginning of next month. This is even more credible because eight gambling dens in the area outside the settlement are scheduled to close tonight (31st). With the hope of resolving both police and tax issues, the final issue to be discussed by both parties is

Chinese Law Court

Jurisdiction. It is expected that there will be some difficulties in the negotiation of this issue, because the courts of the two settlements are subject to the Central Government of Chongqing. Officials involved in the negotiations have refused to comment on this, but it is expected that the negotiations on court jurisdiction will focus on establishing purely local power to govern the courts without government control. Regarding this point, which concerns the integrity of the jurisdiction of Chinese courts, all parties, Chinese and foreign, attach great importance to the development of this matter. To be closed at midnight yesterday,

Eight Gambling Dens

Are (1) Xilaimen, Yuyuan Road, (2) Yile, No. 368 Haige Road, (3) Shengyuan, Daxi Road, (4) Qiuyuan, No. 15 Jisi Feier Road, (5) Bairaohui, No. 864 Yuyuan Road, (6) Mengtuo Kaluo, Yanping Road, (7) Hollywood, No. 1204 Yuyuan Road, (8) Huilegong, No. 42 Daxi Road. However, there are three other major gambling dens, namely the Yuyuan Club, the Zhaofeng Club, and the Chinese General Assembly, which have managed to survive, but will also be closed in the short term. The flower clubs and card factories in Nanshi also uniformly announced a temporary suspension. In the morning, the bets on early card clubs were returned one after another. It is said that the Nanshi and Huxi flower clubs will merge and suspend for one day, and will be expanded again starting today.

### China Cannot Be Conquered: Japanese Planes Bomb Chongqing, Extending the War of Resistance by Three Months; The Inestimable New Air Force Strength of China; Conversation with Chiang Kai-shek's German Head of Guards

Mr. Huatoxins, the German head of guards for Chiang Kai-shek, from Guangzhou, has followed Chiang Kai-shek and served for seven years. Recently, he returned to Germany and passed through Shanghai yesterday, making a statement to foreign reporters. He stated, "Every time Japanese planes bomb Chongqing, it is enough to extend China's war of resistance by three months, because the Chinese people, after being bombed, have become even more determined in their will to resist, and will not stop until the final victory. China has abundant resources and manpower, and these two are sufficient to prove China's persistence in the war of resistance. Over the past three years, looking back at Japan today, it is clear that it has fallen into a very serious state. The Japanese want to negotiate peace with China, but their understanding of the psychology of the Chinese people is not clear. Even today, they still want to conquer by force, not knowing that China is unconquerable. Using force as a tool is only enough to provoke a fierce reaction."

Policy Not Influenced by the Soviet Union

The will of the real Chinese people is strong and not easily swayed. It is inaccurate to say that Chongqing is being guided by Soviet military advisors. There are currently only two Soviet advisors in Chongqing, and there are no Soviet officers or volunteers in the Chinese military. Although the National Government is happy to accept the suggestions of Soviet advisors, it still proceeds in accordance with China's established direction when deciding whether to adopt them, and is not influenced by them. The number of Soviet expatriate groups in Chongqing is also the smallest among foreign groups. When Xinashi accompanied Chiang Kai-shek to inspect the "Free China" area, he did not see any Soviet air force personnel serving in China. The outside world's claim that Moscow has a great influence on China is completely exaggerated.

Chiang Kai-shek is Physically Strong

Mr. Xinashi also denied reports that Chiang Kai-shek's physical strength is declining due to overwork on state affairs. He said that Chiang Kai-shek is energetic and in good health, just as he was in the past. Foreigners who meet with Chiang Kai-shek are all amazed by his physique, because Chiang Kai-shek's strength is like steel and cannot be shaken. For the past three years of the war of resistance, Xinashi's only task has been Chiang Kai-shek's safety.

When Chiang Kai-shek Inspects the Front Lines, His Task is Most Important, But When Chiang Kai-shek is in the Rear, His Task is Lighter, Because No Chinese People Would Harm Him. Xinashi Said, "Even if you ask a rickshaw puller, they know to love and support their leader. The Chinese people now all know that the decision of China's final victory rests with Chiang Kai-shek personally."

Japanese Planes Run Rampant, Public Morale Rises

Xinashi also spoke about Japanese air raids, saying, "Each Japanese air raid, indiscriminately bombing and harming civilians, only results in making the Chinese people more determined in their determination to resist." Xinashi personally saw an old man with white hair whose home was bombed during a Japanese air raid, the roof collapsed, and his two beloved daughters died at the same time. The old man had no sad expression, but using his clothes as a cover for their remains, he said, "You have died, but we must continue to resist to the end."

Air Force Strength is Inestimable

Xinashi also said that China has now begun to build a new air force, but this air force will not be used immediately to meet the enemy, but will be used only when the Japanese air force has been completely depleted. Its value and strength cannot be estimated. China's other military plans are also carried out according to this principle. At the same time, the government has also begun to train a large number of military personnel. This work is being carried out very actively and is more advanced than at the beginning of the war. Xinashi has personally seen the training situation, which is solid proof. Until recently, the strength of the new Chinese army has become considerable, and it can be used as a guarantee of victory in future counterattacks.

The Mountain City's Air Defense is Naturally Blessed

Xinashi also said that until he left Chongqing, foreign groups in Chongqing did not have much reaction to the European war. He said, "When the air raid alarm sounded, we no longer distinguished between French, British, and German expatriates. We knew to escape to air raid shelters. No one thought about the progress of the European war." Chongqing has many stone mountains, which are the best place to build air raid shelters. On top of the air raid shelters, there are often rocks as high as thirty feet. This natural barrier is enough to protect the lives of countless people. The bombs dropped by Japanese planes can hardly destroy these air raid shelters and harm people's lives. Finally, he said that this trip was to return to his homeland and he planned to travel to the United States. His wife traveled with him to China when the Sino-Japanese war began and experienced one hundred and sixty-seven air raids and bombings. He will stay in Shanghai for several days, because he is eager to return home.

Absurd Opinions of Japanese Spokesman

Also, a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy declared at a press conference yesterday that the Japanese planes bombed Chongqing this time to treat the Sino-Japanese incident with "surgery." This absurd statement by the Japanese spokesman was in response to appeals from Chinese and foreign人士 to President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull to impose an arms embargo on Japan. The spokesman said that he regretted that the appeal was not based on justice and humanity, because the Japanese bombing of Chongqing was intended to "go far beyond what missionaries call justice and humanity." Japanese authorities sympathize with the Chinese people, but because bombing is sufficient to "obtain real peace," they have to take this measure. The Japanese bombing is a method of "weakening China's resistance" and giving the Chinese people "peace and happiness." This measure is purely "a matter between China and Japan." If foreigners in China want to interfere in this way, the Japanese will have to reconsider their status. Finally, the Japanese spokesman said that the Japanese planes only bombed militarily important locations, but unlike Europe, civilians are bound to be affected.

### Trade Improves from January to April This Year, Exceeding 110 Million Yuan

Compared with the same period last year, total imports and exports increased by 46,083,0085 yuan.

### Japanese Report that Hong Kong is Recruiting Chinese Laborers; British Embassy Denies; Japanese Newspaper Claims Recruited Chinese Laborers Will Be Sent to the French Front; Hong Kong Authorities Have Never Engaged in Such Work

The British Embassy informed the press that the Allied News Agency yesterday (30th) translated and distributed a message from the Japanese "Continental New Report" in this city, saying that the Hong Kong authorities were recruiting Chinese laborers in South China to be sent to the French front, which is absolutely not true. Hong Kong has never sent out coolies, and the Hong Kong authorities have not recruited Chinese laborers to engage in such work. The news reported by the Japanese side is completely unfounded.

### The Municipal Council Approves Another Increase in Tram Fares; First-Class Fare is 5.01 Cents Per Mile; Third-Class Fare Increases to 3.43 Cents

The Information Office of the Municipal Council announced that the Shanghai Electric Tramway Company, in view of the tightening exchange rate, rising prices of goods, and sharp increase in operating expenses, in order to make up for the losses, applied to the Municipal Council for approval to increase fares. When the company applied for a fare increase in November last year, the exchange rate was around five and a half pence. The current exchange rate has dropped sharply, resulting in even greater expenses for the company, and it had to request another fare increase to supplement its income. The Public Utilities Committee of the Municipal Council discussed the case at a meeting on May 24th. The members believed that the claims were factual and agreed to increase the average fare from 3.71 cents per mile to 5.02 cents for first-class and from 2.54 cents to 3.43 cents for third-class. The above resolution was passed by the Board of Directors of the Municipal Council at its regular meeting on May 29th.

### American President Lines New Ship Launched, Scheduled for June 7th

The American President Lines in this port received a radio message from its San Francisco headquarters stating that the U.S. Navy Committee has invited the chairman of the company's board of directors, Mr. W. G. McAdoo, former California legislator, to preside over the launching ceremony of the new ship "President Jackson."

### Under the Current Situation in the European War, the United States Cannot Maintain Neutrality; Or Will Fight Alongside the Allied Forces; Sermon by MacMullan at the Requiem Mass

The Continental News reported that yesterday (the 30th) was Memorial Day for American soldiers who participated in World War I. At 8:30 a.m., American expatriate officials, businessmen, soldiers, and civilians gathered in front of the graves of American soldiers who participated in the war at the Jing'an Temple Cemetery to hold a memorial service.

Memorial Service

Presided over by Mr. Potterick, the Acting Consul General of the United States in Shanghai. Those present included Admiral Horder, Commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, Colonel Baker, Commander of the U.S. 4th Marine Regiment, Mr. Helmic, U.S. Attorney in China, American celebrities, the American team of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, U.S. Navy and Marine Corps soldiers, Boy Scouts, and American students, totaling one thousand people. The memorial service included a speech by Mr. MacMullan of the American Presbyterian Church in this city, solos by Mrs. Coven and Mrs. Fu, accompaniment by the Marine Corps band with the song "Taps," and the U.S. national anthem. The Marine Corps also fired three volleys of gunfire in salute.

MacMullan's Speech

MacMullan's speech expressed his belief that the United States will soon participate in the European war again. It is said that the day when the United States calls on its citizens to fight alongside the Allied forces may not be far away. The United States certainly hates war, and even in this the darkest night in the history of the Allied countries, it is still trying not to enter the war. It can be seen how eager the United States is for peace, but the United States has realized that it cannot maintain true neutrality. On this Memorial Day, we mourn the soldiers who died in the war to end the war and protect democracy. They made the greatest sacrifices in World War I in order to allow future generations to live in peace and happiness, and they did not expect the world to be as turbulent as it is today. Their children and grandchildren may soon be called upon to make the greatest sacrifice for the country. It is useless to attribute the outbreak of war to any particular cause. We should now repent of past failures before the fallen soldiers and dedicate ourselves to the greatest efforts, not only to seek the victory of the war to end war, but also to win the victory of peace, establish justice and love, so that democracy in the world is safe and secure. Only in this way can the hope of peace and human kindness in the world be realized.

### French Mail Ship Will Arrive in Shanghai

It has been learned that the French mail ship that arrived in Hong Kong last week will arrive in Shanghai this afternoon or tomorrow morning. It is reported that this ship carries a large number of overseas Chinese. The company has not announced the name of the ship, but it is known that the ship's voyage still comes from the Mediterranean Sea to the Far East. As for whether the French mail ship will change its route in the future, the company has not received any notification.

### Chinese and Foreign Banks Implement Cessation of Foreign Exchange Swaps, Forcing Speculators to Settle Upon Maturity, Preventing Excessive Fluctuations and Stabilizing the Market; Silver and Money Businesses Will Change to Daily Interest Accrual Starting Today

Since the Stabilization Fund abandoned maintaining the artificial level of around eight pence against the British pound in June of last year, the black market of foreign exchange in this port has seen exchange rates fluctuate depending on supply and demand. The fierce buying and selling of speculators often causes exchange rates to rise and fall sharply, and sometimes even creates waves, causing alarming fluctuations. Commodity prices are manipulated by them, and legitimate businesses are also affected. In view of this, Chinese and foreign banks in this port have adopted a cooperative approach, and starting from May 31st, they have unanimously refused foreign exchange swaps. Recently, speculation has been very active, and therefore it has been hit hard. Most speculators engage in foreign exchange futures trading, and common futures transactions are for one, two, or three months. If they cannot deliver on time or the exchange rate is unfavorable for delivery, they can apply to the bank for a fee to extend the period to the end of the following month for delivery, in the hope that the exchange rate will change at that time and they can obtain additional profits. Since Chinese and foreign banks have implemented a cessation of swaps, forcing speculators to settle upon maturity without allowing delay, it has put speculators in a difficult situation, because most of them have not prepared liquid funds for turnover.

Stabilization Fund

The English-language Financial and Commercial News published on May 29th said that since the expansion of the European war, speculators have sold foreign exchange one after another, and the Stabilization Fund has absorbed more than one million pounds. The Stabilization Fund currently has an estimated stabilization fund of more than two million pounds. Yesterday, the Chinese newspapers reported that the Stabilization Fund absorbed two million pounds of foreign exchange, which should be the current total amount.

Daily Interest

The 39 member firms of the Money Trade Association all deal with industrial and commercial credit, long-term loans, and irregular overdraft deposits and withdrawals. Recently, they have found that the method of offsetting interest on deposits and debts is not good, and it often results in large reverse dismantling interest. In order to seek mutual benefits, the association decided to reform the old system of interest settlement on deposits and debts, and sent a letter to the Bankers Association to seek agreement. The commercial banks, which are members of the banking industry, have many overdraft deposits and withdrawals, although the amounts are small, but there are also many that are not small. After discussion, it was decided to jointly reform the old system with the money industry and implement the method of settling interest on the daily balance of deposits and debts.

Joint Announcement

Since the Silver and Money Industries Association has reached an agreement, they notified their member firms yesterday to comply with the regulations, and also issued a joint announcement to inform industrial and commercial customers. The announcement said that the member firms of the two associations have different methods for settling interest on deposits and debts with customers. The two associations have decided that starting from June 1st, each firm should calculate the interest on deposits and debts with customers according to the daily balance of deposits and debts and the interest rate on deposits and debts. Special announcement.

Foreign Banks

Yesterday, a financial tycoon told a reporter from Dagang News Agency that the Central Bank is a national bank and not a member of the banking industry, and it has been providing loans to support industry and commerce. It is expected that the bank will also implement this new system. The Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Agricultural Bank of China, and Central Farmers Bank are all members of the Bankers Association, and they will also comply with this system. As for the member banks of the Foreign Exchange Banks Association, it is said that they can also implement this system at the same time, because each foreign bank has always had dealings with Chinese industrial and commercial enterprises.

### Second Special District Court Schedules Burning of Narcotics

The Jiangsu Shanghai Second Special District Local Court has been submitting reports to the authorities every three months for the public burning of confiscated opium, heroin, and gambling tools and contraband items confiscated by the French police department. It has now burned twenty-three times. Now, from July to the end of December of last year, all of the above-mentioned items confiscated during the six months were limited in number, so they were combined into one time by the President of the Court Chen Mao Xian and the Chief Prosecutor Sun Shao Kang and scheduled for burning in public in the open space on the east side of the court at 2:00 pm on June 3rd, the Anti-Smoking Memorial Day. The report was also submitted to the Higher Second Branch Court for transmission to the Judicial Administration Department, and invitations were sent to the Shanghai First Special District Court, the Higher Second Branch Court, the French Police Department, the Shanghai Bar Association, and other agencies and groups to send representatives to supervise the event.

### Young Owner of Lao Ren Yuan Yong Gift Shop Rescued After Being Kidnapped; Four Kidnappers Arrested Pending Investigation

Chen Kang Jun, the eleven-year-old son of Chen Tongshi, the owner of Lao Ren Yuan Yong Gift Shop at No. 383 and No. 359 Hankou Road in Nanjing, is a student at Shanghai East Elementary School at No. 514 Fuzhou Road. At 7:00 a.m. on the 21st of this month, Chen Hai left home to go to school when he suddenly encountered several kidnappers who grabbed Chen Hai. Afterwards, they demanded a ransom of 50,000 yuan. Chen Tongshi reported to the General Patrol Room, and Chinese Detective Feng Qishan conducted an investigation. Until the previous day, Detective Feng received a report that the kidnappers were located, and he and Chinese Detective Yang Peisheng, Jiang Shangpei, and Detective Ma Guangqi went to No. 1107-44 Dong You Heng Road and arrested Shi Wang, a woman from Zhenjiang (also known as Xue Wang, 26 years old), and rescued the hostage Chen Kang Jun. Then, they went to No. 22 Dou Pai, Lane 1030, Dong You Heng Road and arrested accomplices Zhao Guojun (38 years old) from Jiangbei, Wei Xianshan (56 years old), Tang Minggeng (also known as A San, 37 years old) from Changzhou, and Li Guofu (27 years old), bringing them back to the patrol room. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Patrol Room Lawyer Ru Bao Yi requested permission to detain them because the case still required investigation and the arrest of accomplices. After interrogation by Judge Feng Shide, he ordered them to be remanded in custody and rescheduled for questioning.

### Abandoned Woman Requests Support; And Requests Litigation Assistance

Wu Zhuoqi, a woman from Wuxi (currently 40 years old), is from a prominent family in Xishan and once studied at the Shanghai Chinese and Western Girls' School. More than ten years ago, Wu married Zhang Qiming, a compradore in a British firm, through a matchmaker. After living together, their feelings were good at first, but later Zhang became lustful due to his rich income and combined with a prostitute, so he regarded Wu as a thorn in his eye. Not only did he not fulfill his obligations of living together, but he also cut off the expenses needed for life. Wu had no choice but to file a lawsuit for cohabitation and payment of living expenses several years ago, and Zhang also filed a lawsuit for divorce. After years of litigation, Zhang lost the lawsuit, and Wu's lawsuit was settled by reconciliation, with Zhang paying 120 yuan per month for living expenses. However, after only a few months of payment, Zhang took the prostitute to Hong Kong, causing Wu to be unable to collect living expenses. Although she applied to the court for enforcement, she was unable to enforce it because Zhang had no property in Shanghai. Recently, the cost of living in Shanghai has risen, so Wu hired lawyers Sun Zuji and Du Xi again to file a lawsuit for support with the First Special Court, requesting a judgment that Zhang pay 290 yuan per month for living expenses, with a temporary limit of five years, totaling 17,400 yuan. She also requested a public announcement because Zhang's whereabouts are unknown, and she requested litigation assistance because she could not afford to pay the litigation fees. Judge Ni Zheng Ao opened a hearing on this case yesterday and questioned Wu in detail about her request, and then decided to reschedule it for questioning.

### Extension of Time for Dispersal of Refugees

The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association issued a notice in the middle of last month to reduce the public burden, stating that all refugees to be dispersed by charitable organizations and shelters should leave the shelters before yesterday and would not be extended, etc. According to reporters from the Pingming News Agency, except for the young and strong refugees in the shelters affiliated with the International Relief Committee, who were all dispersed before yesterday, the refugees in the shelters directly affiliated with the Refugee Association have nowhere to go and it is difficult to disperse them. Therefore, it has been decided to extend the time for dispersal.

### Socialite Wang Baoyu Dies from Gunshot Wound Yesterday - Lived Alone in Pei'en Apartments - Luxurious Furnishings and Extensive Social Life - Shot Twice, Assailant Flees

Yesterday morning at 8:05 AM, a bloody assassination occurred in Room 35, Pei'en Apartments, No. 2, intersection of Avenue Dubail and Avenue Joffre in the French Concession. The deceased was Wang Baoyu (also known as Wang Baoye), niece of the late Zeng Zhongming. She died instantly from two gunshot wounds. According to details obtained by a reporter from the Pingming News Agency, the circumstances are as follows:

The Assassination

Yesterday morning at 8:05 AM, Wang was sound asleep, not yet awake, when two unexpected visitors arrived. One was dressed in a Western suit, and the other in Chinese attire. They knocked on the door and requested to see her. The maid inquired about their purpose. The visitors, identifying themselves as surnamed Li, stated they had important matters to discuss with Miss Wang. The maid informed Wang, who then instructed the male servant, Zhao Qihua, to inquire further into their intentions. At this time, Wang, still sleepy, draped a dressing gown over herself and stepped out of the bedroom. Unexpectedly, one of the visitors drew a handgun and fired at Wang, discharging two shots. One hit Wang's chest, and the other her left temple. Wang, in pain, turned and fled, seeking refuge in the bathroom. However, due to the critical nature of her injuries, she collapsed beside the bathtub, bleeding profusely, and soon died. Seeing their objective achieved, the shooters hastily attempted to escape. The male servant, Zhao Ouhua, witnessing the tragedy, tried to block their path at the door. The two men then threatened Zhao with their guns, ultimately forcing their way out. Afterwards, Zhao reported the incident to the Louza Police Station, which immediately dispatched detectives to the scene to investigate. Wang's body was transported to the small hospital on Route Tenant de la Tour for examination. Meanwhile, an investigation into the motive for the murder was launched.

Extensive Social Life

Wang Baoyu was from Guangdong, 27 years old, fluent in English and French, and had a wide social circle. She possessed a beautiful face and graceful demeanor, and often socialized with both Chinese and Western individuals. Her Western name was Rosemary Wang, and she was a socialite. She had no family in Shanghai and lived alone in Room 25 of the Pei'en Apartments on Avenue Dubail. The aforementioned male and female servants were also employed by the apartment. Wang's room was decorated luxuriously, complete with a reception room, living room, and bathroom. In her reception room hung a colored oil portrait of Zeng Shenhe, and there was a valuable five thousand yuan radio. She usually kept to herself, but her residence was often filled with Chinese and Western friends. Whether her murder had political undertones is still under investigation by the police.

Police Investigation

Further reports indicate that the deceased had a foster mother, Yan Li, 57 years old, a Shanghainese residing at No. 8, Lane 65, Chengdu Road, commonly referred to as the foster mother. Upon hearing the news, she rushed to the morgue to view the body. As the deceased had no immediate family in Shanghai, it is likely that the foster mother will handle the funeral arrangements. It is said that the deceased was the niece of Zeng Zhongming, who was assassinated in Hanoi last year. Wang Baoxian and Wang Baoye were both aliases. It is also rumored that political reasons accounted for 70% of the motives for the death. The police have taken the deceased's letters and documents from her room back to the police station and summoned the female servant for questioning. Meanwhile, the police have dispatched detectives to search for the perpetrators and bring them to justice.

Publishing News

The tenth issue of the bi-monthly "International Affairs" has been published, with even more exciting content, such as "When Will the European War End?", "The British and American Far East Military Bases," and "Japan in the Eyes of American Journalists." These are all translated works that those concerned about the European situation urgently need to read.

Other articles are also very exciting.

### A Study of the History of Ryukyu (2)

During the Ming Dynasty, Emperor Taizu gifted them with thirty-six surnames of people skilled in seamanship. The King was grateful and performed his duties and tributes with utmost respect. China also frequently sent envoys to pacify and reassure them. Later, it was destroyed by Japan, and the King was captured. Communication with China was cut off for several decades. Afterward, envoys were sent again, saying that the King had been imprisoned but remained steadfast and unyielding. Japan could do nothing, and sent him back to restore the country. From then on, tributes were paid as usual. It is said that the king had been passed down from a single family since records began, without any change. Because the country was poor and weak, and adjacent to the powerful Japan, it was often subjected to servitude. Japan still often desired to covet its land, and it survived entirely on the profits from trading tribute boats, which were exempt from customs duties. Much of the soy sauce was borrowed from Japan, and 80-90% of the goods traded were also transported to Japan. However, the people were so poor that they could not afford to buy them. Japan, therefore, painstakingly plotted to destroy it and be satisfied. Why is this? Is it to demonstrate national power? Overthrowing this poor and weak country is not worthy of being called brave. Thus, from a moral standpoint, it is unjust; from an emotional standpoint, it is unfair; and from an intellectual standpoint, it is unwise. Western countries will laugh at their concubine, the world will criticize them, future generations will condemn them, neighboring countries will discuss them, and small countries will prepare for them. The art of war says, "If they are arrogant, we should fear; nothing is insurmountable." Dou Bopi said, "If we display our three armies and don our armor and weapons to confront them with force, they will fear and conspire against us." Are there none in today's East who will conspire against them!

### In the Midst of Daylight Saving Time - Deeper Meaning

— Shi Zhao

Starting this morning, all clocks in Shanghai were set forward one hour simultaneously. This is the so-called Daylight Saving Time.

Overall, this movement itself is generally unobjectionable. Everyone gets up an hour earlier, goes to the office an hour earlier, finishes work an hour earlier, eats dinner an hour earlier, and goes to bed an hour earlier, which shouldn't cause any harm.

However, at the inception of this Daylight Saving Time movement, we would like to offer a small piece of advice. We believe that at this time, in addition to adjusting the surface of our lives, if everyone can also adjust and innovate the content of our lives, then this Daylight Saving Time movement will have a greater and deeper meaning.

If the view of saving daylight is only to advance the clock by one hour, then this movement will become such a ridiculous and meaningless act! As a result of saving daylight, unscrupulous merchants will exploit and profit one hour earlier, shameless people will sell out their country and seek glory one hour earlier, warmongers will engage in the mission of slaughter one hour earlier, and the licentious and shameless will live a licentious and shameless life one hour earlier... this will not help the overall situation.

But we are not so pessimistic. We believe that there are still conscientious and righteous citizens everywhere. At this time, we should have a deep reflection.

Today, many Chinese compatriots are suffering from devastation, killing, and bombing. Many Chinese compatriots are displaced and wandering in hunger and cold. At this time, anyone who is a citizen should deeply reflect on themselves. We should ask ourselves, have we shown the slightest sympathy for our compatriots in distress? Have we given a helping hand to our brothers and sisters in distress? Today, at this time, we should each ask ourselves, are we worthy of our country? Are we worthy of our society? Are we worthy of our nation?

Today, when the hands of the clock are advanced by one hour, we should make a great determination; from today onwards, we will not only advance our time of life on the surface, but we must also enrich the content and meaning of life in our bones, and make our life inextricably linked to the lives of our compatriots in suffering; let our lives share the fate of the country and the nation; we must entrust our lives to this great era of raging waves.

We want to deepen the meaning of the Daylight Saving Time movement in this way.

### Talking About Maxims and Such

— Bao Fuxing

Maxims and proverbs have existed since ancient times, and there are many in various Western countries as well. With the development of the times, there seem to be more and more. Maxims are mostly meaningful and insightful sentences spoken by famous people or found in books and articles, while proverbs are meaningful and insightful idioms passed down from various times and places, both ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign.

Especially in China, with a long history, vast territory, and developed culture, there are naturally countless maxims and proverbs. However, "more" is not necessarily a good phenomenon. While most common maxims and proverbs are meaningful and valuable, a small portion containing toxins is also numerous. For example, "A wise man submits to circumstances" and "Everyone sweeps the snow from their own doorstep" form part of the inferior nature of us Chinese. It makes me feel that "a fallacy is fiercer than a tiger!"

On the other hand, some people only regard those ideologically correct and insightful maxims and proverbs as something to talk about, write on paper, and inscribe on memorial albums, as if practice is still a secondary issue. A few years ago, I personally saw a most diligent student writing on another classmate's memorial album: "Success comes from diligence, and failure comes from playfulness." Isn't this a ridiculous contradiction? The reason for this contradiction, I believe, is that the student only recognized the "words" of the maxim and did not understand the clear and profound "meaning" implied in the maxim. In fact, our main purpose in writing and reading maxims should be to understand them! Practice them!

In short, we must value the power of maxims and proverbs. For those that are toxic and absurd, we must correct them as soon as possible! For those that are ideologically correct and meaningful, we may regard them as our life's mentor and compass. Strive to practice them! They will give us great help!

### Reading Ba Jin's "Autumn"

— Xu Yi

Unexpectedly, on the cold and lonely "isolated island" literary scene, I could read this work full of enthusiasm.

"Autumn" is the third part of "Torrent," a novel of over seven hundred pages. The author himself said, "I was originally a small person, and I can only do small things." I believe this is Ba Jin's modesty, because here one can not only see the torrent of life organized by love and hate, joy and suffering. Moreover, the author clearly drew a path for readers to take with his blood and tears. The author's enthusiasm ignited the reader's enthusiasm, and the author's tears won the reader's tears. But this is definitely not a purely sentimental, but a joyful, bright, and moving expression.

This book has reduced a lot of melancholy compared to "Family" and "Spring" ("Torrent" one and two). This may be due to the influence of the author's recent battle life. Although there is also the "Autumn Provincial Grandpa" who died of illness under the control of cruel etiquette, and "Shuzhen," who committed suicide by drowning after being used as a "punching bag" by her mother due to the dissipation of her relatives. But the ending of "Autumn" is still bright. The author not only smashed the large family system of the "Gao Family" as the center of the story, but the most exciting and noteworthy thing is that the author made "Juexin" - who has always been a prisoner of feudal forces - continue to live. I believe this is not the author's cruelty. On the contrary, it is the author's enthusiasm that makes it so. Because in the end, "Juexin" wrote to his third brother far away in "Shanghai": "My enterprising heart has not died."

Perhaps because the author lived an unstable life on the "isolated island" and was eager to leave Shanghai, "Autumn" seems to be inferior to Mr. "Ba Jin's" other works in terms of wording. But what does the text count for? A heart full of enthusiasm is enough to make the work substantial.

According to the author, "Group", the fourth of "Torrent", is no longer the story of the "Gao Family". I think that's great. Mr. "Ba Jin", who lives in the crowd, will definitely write "Group" more wonderfully and powerfully than the first three parts of "Torrent".

(Note): "Autumn" was published in April this year by Kaiming Bookstore.

Hawthorn Detective Story

### The Fate of the Dance Queen

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter 1 "A Very Pretty Miss!"

First of all, I must sincerely apologize to the readers. In the past two or three years, not counting the verbal ones, the letters I have received from readers can not only be said to "pile up inches," but are simply "feet" and more. Although the forms of these letters are not all the same - some are inquiries, some are urging, some even start cursing and scolding - their goals are the same - to have me publish a few of the strange cases that my old friend Hawthorn has experienced recently. Because I - Bao Lang - am the only recorder, and I have recorded no less than fifty or sixty cases of Hawthorn's exploits over the years. They are obviously Hawthorn's confidants - "Hawthorn fans," so although their attitudes need to be corrected, I believe their motives are not bad, and I can of course forgive them. But I also have a helpless reason.

In the past three years, although I have been in Shanghai for various reasons, Hawthorn is in the mainland and is holding an important position and has been separated from me for a long time. I cannot publish his cases casually without his permission, which the readers of course already know. Hawthorn recently gave me a permission in response to my repeated transfer of readers' requests - allowing me to publicly publish the case of "The Fate of the Dance Queen."

This case occurred on the eve of the storm - on a clear morning in late spring and early summer. I happened to be living in his residence at No. 77 Avenue Ivan, because he always had me stay for a few days every few times. At the beginning of the case, it seemed to contain some happy meaning, but due to the gradual development of the case, the panic, suspense, and danger we experienced can be regarded as extremely "turbulent." Hawthorn seemed to have a bit of disgust for the requesting woman at the beginning, but after he started, his curiosity increased proportionally with the progress of the case, even to the point of "wanting to stop but unable to stop." His keen observation, sound understanding, courageous spirit, and the perseverance that would not stop until the final victory were all shown in this case. (1)

### Marriage and Career

— Jin Chun

A few years ago, an American scholar carefully studied the proportion of women engaged in various careers and the number of marriage opportunities, and obtained the following statistics.

Occupation Percentage of Marriages Percentage of College Graduates

Librarian 22.2 85.2

Educator 35.8 76.1

Doctor 38.0 100

Scientific Work 48.0 70.0

Lawyer 50.0 100

Artist 51.0 20.0

Church Service 54.5 72.7

Journalist 55.8 60.5

Writer 59.9 46.6

Other 60.0 70.0

Actress 64.2 19.4

Musician 67.1 19.7

Politician 68.7 50.0

Social Work 75.0 54.7

Looking at the table above, we know that those engaged in social work have the most marriage opportunities, followed by those involved in politics, and then musicians. The worst is being a librarian.

The library is originally the best meeting place for students. Unexpectedly, the impact of the staff is so opposite, which can prove the difference between reading and doing things.

### Self-Control (2)

The freedom that young people talk about is nothing but recklessness and indulgence. They are unable to determine what is right and what is wrong. Therefore, they use self-expression as a talisman: "You must be independent, be yourself, follow your impulses, and learn lessons from experience." The difficulty lies here. People today do not want a master, not even their own self-esteem. What they want is freedom, to do as they please. They oppose laws, oppose morality, and do not want to live a disciplined life. They all try, but do not want to succeed in one thing. Today's entertainment opportunities are unprecedented, and people's suffering and misfortune are also unprecedented. "Letting yourself go" and doing as you please does not bring us true happiness, but rather a lot of misery, regret, shame, and disgust. Regarding morality, one thing we should understand is that morality is fundamentally neither new nor old. Frankly speaking, so-called new morality is just old morality in new clothes. Young people today think they are the vanguard of morality, but in fact, they themselves have never been the creators of morality. The scriptures say, "Whatever a man sows, that shall he also reap." This truth is always new. They cannot abandon the shared morality of mankind without paying a price. Generally speaking, moral standards are the result of hundreds of years of hard and valuable experience on which mankind has reached a consensus. Therefore, no one today should laugh at or criticize it, and even more so should not regard oneself as a new Messiah in behavior. It must be understood that a valuable moral revolution must make morality better and enable people to obtain a more noble way of life from a more complete "self-training." Doing as one pleases, being unrestrained, and having crude words, deeds, and attitudes are revolution, but it cannot be said to be a moral revolution. Young people like to ridicule moral habits and customs, which cannot be regarded as a sign of moral progress. Is it not futile to overthrow what we already have without being able to replace it with something more perfect? (To be continued)

### On the Relationship Between Protagonist and Supporting Role

— Junmei

"No matter how good the peony is, it all depends on the green leaves to support it." A delicate and beautiful flower, without branches and leaves to hold it up, no matter how beautiful it is, it will inevitably make people feel monotonous. Therefore, although the protagonist's skills in a drama must be good, the supporting role cannot be too bad at least. However, "Good actors are easy to find, but hard bones are hard to find." Only the leading actors are seen coming and going like metabolism, while the good supporting actors are always these few who are floating and sinking in the theater world. Some people blame the Peking opera in recent years for not having good plays to listen to. The opera troupe only sells one big beam, and sometimes even a big axis is not enough to put together neatly, which does not seem to be harsh!

The reason for the lack of supporting roles is due to the extreme development of the "star system" of Peking opera in recent years, which has caused the audience to "only watch the actor, not the play," which is undeniable.

Watching the actor but not the play is enough to discourage the supporting actors with true skills. We often see supporting roles singing as hard as the protagonist in the theater, but the result is that the supporting role often not only does not receive a word of appreciation, but sometimes only gets the hissing laughter and contempt of the audience under the stage. At the same time, the protagonist, for the sake of his own reputation, does not hesitate to use his position to suppress and prevent the supporting role from developing too much, creating a situation where the guest overwhelms the host. In order to protect their own interests, the supporting actors can only continue to muddle through forever and do not want to strengthen themselves.

To correct this error, we first require the audience to eliminate the concept of the protagonist. What they listen to and watch is the entire play. In the structure of the entire play, the protagonist is only in a relatively important position. To make the performance of the entire play a complete success, it is necessary for all the other actors, even if they are only appearing briefly, to work hard together. Second, the protagonist should not ignore the supporting role, thinking that they can ignore the perfunctory performance of the supporting roles in addition to their own singing and performance. Naturally, they should not be jealous, but should supervise and correct them. Secondly, the supporting role should not give up on themselves. The supporting role should understand their importance in the play, which is enough to greatly affect the success of the performance. In the past, Da Liwu, Jia Honglin, Shen Sanyuan, Feng Jinshou, Jin Lin, Qian Jinfu, and Wang Changlin, and today's Zhang Chunyan, Bao Jixiang, Yao Yufu, Jiang Miaoxiang, Hou Xirui, and Zhao Tongshan, who is not in the position of a supporting role and has obtained a considerable position? Therefore, the writer feels that the problem of hanging a sign is actually undesirable. In the opera troupe, the actors often fall out because of the relationship of hanging a sign. Why bother?

Entertainment Traces

### The Honeybee and the Butterfly

— Xiao Tian

On a holiday, I went strolling in the flower garden with some friends and several young ladies. Seeing the blossoms vying for beauty, and the bees buzzing and butterflies flitting, a friend jokingly said, "The dance hall at night is like this garden of flowers, and we are just like the bees and butterflies." I replied, "Do you know which is superior, the bee or the butterfly?" He said, "They are the same, just wanton flower-lovers." I then quoted Mr. Li's evaluation of the bee and the butterfly, which said: "Spiders are noisy and disturbing, butterflies are leisurely and carefree. Bees plunder the flower's surface and cruelly harm the flower the most; butterflies infuse the flower's spirit and are not mutually hateful with the flower. The butterfly is the flower's intimate friend, the bee is the flower's pest. Butterflies come and go gracefully, gathering without a trace; bees build nests, gathering crowds, consuming little, but striving for excessive accumulation, only to be cut off by others. Moreover, they use their poisonous sting indiscriminately, willing to become the evil insects of humanity. Butterflies are captured by fairy interests, while bees are a creature possessing greed, anger, and ignorance."

I happened to meet a young lady, whose youth had already passed its prime. She wore long-sleeved clothing, and had a rather proper and quiet appearance. She sat alone in a corner. If a guest asked her to dance, she would get up; otherwise, she would lower her head and remain silent, not acting in a way that would attract bees and butterflies. I tried dancing with her, and her skill was still good. As we gradually became familiar, she went to the dressing room to change clothes and return to the dance floor, but she involuntarily began to weep. Surprised, I asked her about it. She showed me her arm, which was covered with knife scars. She then burst into tears, crying loudly for a long time before finally calming down. She told me her life story. Her father was a secretary at a foreign company. He had a daughter, but no son. He had some savings. Her father died when her sister was twelve, entrusting her to her aunt on his deathbed. But the person he entrusted was not trustworthy. When the young lady reached puberty, her aunt seized her assets and sold her body, placing her in a brothel. She was in her sixteenth year. She had caught the eye of a prominent figure, who wanted to take her as a concubine, but the madam demanded a price of 30,000 gold coins, and the matter was dropped. Before this, when the young lady's father worked at the foreign company, the son of the Chinese manager, who was five or six years older than her, often visited, and they played together like childhood sweethearts. Now, they met again at a dance party on the Atlantic. They seemed to recognize each other, and gradually began to talk, realizing that they were truly childhood friends. By this time, the young lady was nineteen years old and tired of the life of prostitution, so she wanted to commit herself to him. But the official already had a wife, so she reluctantly lived as his mistress. The first wife was notoriously fierce, and the children were also difficult to tame. The young lady humbly went along, without a word of complaint. After six years, her beloved suffered from a minor ailment. The sister looked to the heavens, weeping blood, wishing to take his place with her own body. The knife scars on her arm were the traces of cutting off her flesh. The first wife drove her out of the house, leaving her with only a few hundred gold coins. Left with no choice, she wanted to make a living by dancing. Every time she changed clothes, the image of her late husband would appear in her mind, hence her sobs. This was something I heard last spring, and I kept it secret, not daring to reveal it. Today, sitting idly among the flowers, discussing bees and butterflies, I suddenly remembered it, so I recounted the story to aid our conversation. My friend said, "The young lady has remarried for more than two months now, and she has already gone abroad with her good husband." I smiled and said, "Is the one she married a bee or a butterfly?" My friend said, "Judging by her attitude, she is still gentle and refined, probably of the butterfly type."

### The Rushed "Three Smiles"

— Premiering Simultaneously in Two Theaters on the Seventh

The Art China Film Company's new film "Three Smiles" is already more than halfway through production and is scheduled to premiere at the Shanghai Grand Theater on the seventh. Yue Feng stated that the performance of "Three Smiles" is indeed superior to past works, mainly because the plot is tight and relaxed. The young actress Li Lili, who plays "Qiu Xiang," is particularly brilliant. Yan Hua, who plays Tang Bohu, is handsome and dashing. In addition, Han Lungen, Yin Xiucen, Hongda, and Cang Yinqiu have all done their best, contributing greatly to the film's strength.

The China Film Company's "Three Smiles" has also started filming. The other day, China Film Company owner Liu Zhonghao and Zhang Youchuan, Dong Tianya, and others held late-night discussions to speed up work. According to Mr. Dong, the film can be completed before the seventh and is scheduled to premiere at the Jin Cheng Theater starting on the evening of the seventh. Zhou Xuan plays Qiu Xiang, and the role of Tang Bohu has been changed to Bai Yun. Fearing that the old studio is not sufficient, the new studio on La Du Road has been opened early, and filming is taking place on both sides at the same time. In this case, the "Three Smiles" filmed by both Art China and China Film Companies are bound to compete head-to-head at the Shanghai Grand and Jin Cheng Theaters.

### Chess Garden

— Compiled by Lian Xuezheng, Proofread by Lu Cheng

Opening Method - 66th Game - Black Goes First

Cannon Two to Five Cannon Eight to Five Horse Two Advances Three Horse Eight Advances Seven Chariot One to Two

Chariot Nine Advances One Chariot One Advances Six Chariot Nine Moves to Four Chariot Two to Three Horse Two Advances Three

Cannon Eight Advances One Pawn Three Advances One Cannon Eight Moves to Three Horse Three Advances Four Cannon Three Advances Three

Horse Four Advances Six Chariot Three Advances Two Cannon Two Moves to Seven

As shown in the diagram, the black side can either advance the chariot three squares to capture the cannon, or move it to the fourth rank to capture the horse. However, there are many subsequent variations. If handled improperly, it is easy to lose the initiative. Also, in this game, if black moves the cannon eight forward two squares, and the red side responds by advancing the chariot four squares to capture the cannon, it will result in losing a piece and losing the initiative.

### An Interview with Ma Lianliang (Part Two)

— Master of the Ai Ping Studio

Opposed to Scenery

You are working hard to promote old dramas, but some outsiders are said to oppose scenery. Is this true?

(Answer) When we perform dramas, we choose the good and follow it, and we change the bad. There is no question of opposing anything. However, I have never used scenery in my performances. Why? Because it hinders the development of art and diverts the audience's attention. Because Chinese drama has always combined singing and dancing, scenery that is too gaudy may be pleasing for a while, but it will inevitably turn into a competition of scenery. If one has real mountains, another will have real water, one can create fire, and another can make thunder. Like piling up a tower, the higher it gets, the more unstable it becomes. If you really want to see nature, why not just watch a movie?

You are the president of the Fu Feng Society. What are your standards for selecting supporting actors?

(Answer) My reasons for requiring supporting actors are extremely simple. In short, they must each fulfill their responsibilities. If they are careless about the responsibilities they should fulfill, or do not abide by the rules, then it is not in line with my principles, and it will be difficult to get along with them! In general, theatrical troupes are very difficult. Some are slick and opportunistic, some are self-righteous, some are casual, and some are foolishly hardworking. Among them, except for the foolishly hardworking ones, who are willing to listen to advice and can still be employed, the other three are difficult for me to cooperate with. (Note: On this day, Mr. Ma told many interesting stories about the performance of supporting actors, but due to space constraints, I will write about them separately when I have time.)

Reforming Costumes

(Question) Mr. Suo Nin has made many reforms to the costumes of the characters in the plays, which is a unique highlight of the national opera scene. Can you tell us more about this?

(Answer) This is a small contribution of mine to national opera. It is also difficult to guarantee that there are no mistakes, so I still hope that those who are enthusiastic about national opera will correct and guide me from time to time, which would be a great pleasure! I have always paid great attention to the costumes of the actors in my performances. They are bright and radiant, which can enhance the spirit and promote ambition at a glance. The psychology of loving beauty is the same for everyone. The coordination of colors and the uniformity of light and shadow are regarded as essential elements of drama even in the West. In the past, people did not pay attention to this in national opera, or they regarded it as a lower-class entertainment. Therefore, no one bothered to study the costumes of emperors and prime ministers, always thinking that "drama is just drama" as a small way to deceive oneself and others.

(Question) From what you have said, you have put a lot of effort into reforming costumes. But I wonder if anyone has supported you?

(Answer) In the past, I did not dare to talk rashly about this "reforming costumes" matter. However, after launching this initiative, I received the approval of one or two older gentlemen, and only then did I dare to boldly proceed.
