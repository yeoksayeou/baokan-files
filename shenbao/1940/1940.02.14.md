### Successful Flanking Maneuver by Guangxi National Army in Guinan; Japanese Begin General Retreat Towards Nanning; Troops Under National Army Advanced South of Binyang and Captured Wuling; National Army in Hubei Recaptured Strongholds Near Songhe Town

Chongqing: This dispatch announced today's Guangxi war report, stating that the war is now in progress in Silong. This location is southeast of Binyang, which was recaptured by the National Army on Sunday night. After receiving reinforcements, the Japanese army, which had retreated from Wuming towards Shuangqiao, launched a counterattack on Sunday night to support a Japanese force retreating southwest of Binyang. However, after reaching Silong, the National Army launched an irresistible encirclement and flanking maneuver. The Japanese army has now begun a general retreat towards Nanning. (Reuters, 13th)

Liuzhou: The Japanese army that broke through from Binyang and fled south was ambushed and severely defeated by the National Army near Wuling (south of Binyang). By the 12th, the Japanese army suffered over several hundred fatalities, and the remnants scattered and fled. Wuling was immediately declared recaptured. Currently, the National Army is sweeping up remaining forces. Another unit of the National Army surrounded and annihilated the Japanese in Huangxu (southwest of Binyang). By noon on the 12th, all the Japanese had been wiped out, with over 1,500 Japanese killed. Currently, there is no trace of the Japanese in that area. The Japanese army at Shuangqiao on the Yongwu Road received reinforcements and resisted stubbornly. After a day and night of encirclement and annihilation by the National Army, around two thousand Japanese were wounded or killed. The remaining Japanese forces scattered into the mountains in small groups, and the National Army is currently searching and suppressing them. (13th)

Brief Overview of the Great Victory of the National Army in Guinan

Chongqing: A reporter from the Central News Agency received a phone call from the front lines in Guinan at noon on the 12th. According to the information, the overview and significance of this great victory of the National Army in Guinan are as follows: The Japanese army, in retaliation for the disastrous defeat at Kunlun Pass, mobilized troops from various regions, reaching a total of 100,000 men. They launched a large-scale invasion, dividing their forces into left and right flanks, maneuvering towards the Binyang-Wuming area, and sending an advance force along the Yongbin Road, hoping to penetrate deep in one fell swoop and seize key locations in Guinan. The brave soldiers of the National Army, at the beginning of the Japanese army's movements, completed a rock-solid formation for annihilating the Japanese according to pre-arranged deployments. The Japanese army, believing they had the upper hand, sent their right flank through Pujin, detouring via Yongchun and other locations directly to Binyang, even briefly infiltrating the vicinity of Shanglin. The left flank broke through Shuangqiao and approached the southern outskirts of Wuming. While the Japanese army was advancing recklessly, the National Army resolutely blocked the Japanese advance on the Yongbin Road, while patiently awaiting the opportunity. A large army advanced to the rear of the Japanese army and their outer flanks, beginning to cut them off everywhere and launching attacks that bisected them, first recapturing Yongchun (east of Nanning), then Shibu (west of Nanning), and after five days and nights of bloody battles, continuously recapturing major transportation strongholds on the right flank of the Japanese, such as Gula, Gantang, Nahe, and Daqiaoxi. The Japanese's winding basic road line was cut into several sections by the National Army, and their flanking formation was destroyed. On the Yongwu Road, the main force of the Japanese army was completely intercepted north of Shuangqiao by the National Army after a night of attacks. The National Army seized Shuangqiao, beginning a heavy encirclement, cutting off their rear. At this time, the basic work of annihilating the Japanese by the entire National Army was completed. On the night of the 9th, a typical comprehensive annihilation battle was launched. After two days and nights of fierce fighting, the Japanese army completely collapsed, and the National Army advanced smoothly, fully displaying a heroic posture as firm as steel and capable of swallowing the barbarian invaders. The Japanese army's hasty retreat was a tragic sight, like souls swimming in a cauldron. After the National Army annihilated the main force of the Japanese army near Binyang, Shanglin, and Wuming, the war situation took a sharp turn. In addition to separately appeasing the recovered areas, the National Army jointly launched a fierce pursuit of the remaining Japanese forces. As of the morning of the 12th, the war situation was as follows: The area between Shanglin and Binyang was littered with abandoned Japanese corpses, with no trace of the Japanese. The remnants of the Japanese army in Binyang were in a state of complete collapse under the National Army's unstoppable advance. After the National Army split up to intercept and fiercely annihilate them, over five thousand more Japanese were killed. The National Army took advantage of the victory to recapture Binyang. The remaining Japanese forces fled to the vicinity of Silong. The Japanese between Wuming and Shuangqiao were still receiving reinforcements and resisting stubbornly, but after a fierce encirclement and annihilation by the National Army, they are now fleeing towards Nanning. In total, over 20,000 Japanese troops have been annihilated in the three areas of Shanglin, Binyang, and Wuming up to the present moment. In summary, the Japanese army suffered a disastrous defeat in this invasion. From all perspectives, the National Army has achieved extremely astonishing success. First, it can prove that the National Army's proactive and planned strategy of annihilating the Japanese can shatter any of the Japanese's vicious attempts. Second, the Japanese army in Nanning is becoming increasingly fragmented, and the time for them to be trapped to death by the National Army is not far off. Third, on the surface, not only is the threat to Binyang and Wuming lifted, but in reality, these two strongholds have been transformed into the keys to the National Army's initiative to strike the Japanese. Therefore, the significance of this great victory is no less than the victories in northern Hunan and northern Guangdong. In conclusion, the reporter stated that the morale of the front-line soldiers is high, and a joyous and vibrant atmosphere prevails. (13th)

Editorial

### A Warning to All Industries

The winter solstice is for settling accounts, and every household earns money; the Spring Festival is for booming business, and everything rises in price. Thus, smiling faces, crying faces, joyful sounds, and curses are interwoven in Shanghai society. It turns out that all industries and businesses buy low and sell high, earning money as their principle and normal state. Especially under the trend of rising prices, earning money is often beneficial to the entire national economy, and should not be rashly condemned as immoral and unreasonable. Putting oneself in the position of those engaged in industry and commerce, what reason is there for their goods not to rise in price when other goods are rising? What reason is there for them not to earn money when others are earning money? Therefore, accusations of forgetting morality for profit and being unscrupulous can be used to scold everything and slightly vent one's hatred, but they are not enough to convince the current wealthy.

Generally, those who have become wealthy have been encouraged by making money in the past two years and have been hinted at by the fact that prices have been rising for the past year and never turned back. Not only do they not feel guilty about earning money, nor do they feel satisfied with earning it, but they also regret what opportunities they missed in the past and failed to earn more. Not only do they not want to pull back from the brink, but they will also try every means to seize opportunities in the future. This is the New Year's psychology of the general business community. In this regard, we will not reiterate the pedantic talk of maintaining prosperity, but we have something that we urgently want the wealthy to consider carefully: First, the reason why Shanghai's industries and businesses earned money last year was due to the gradual rise in prices. The reason why sales were strong despite rising prices was due to the mismatch between supply and demand. The reason for the mismatch between supply and demand was not the imbalance between production quantity and consumption quantity, but the obstacles caused by the surrounding human affairs. As a result, wealth and goods cannot flow smoothly. Earning money through the smooth flow of wealth and goods is the way to generate wealth; earning money through the non-smooth flow of wealth and goods is abnormal, is perverted, and is an absolutely unsustainable temporary phenomenon. In economic principles, there is a natural instinct for the natural tendency towards equilibrium regarding the high and low of value, and the full and empty of wealth. This instinct is attached to various instincts other than human commercial behavior and comes with them. For example, items do not necessarily have to enter the hands of merchants to become commercial goods, but they must move to places of higher value. Consumption and desires change according to economic capacity, and the population gathers and disperses according to economic conditions. In short, the economic cannot remain unreasonable for long, there is a natural instinct for ebb and flow, and there is a natural law of regulation. In fact, the current unreasonable high profits are due to human obstacles. This high profits themselves will be the powerful driving force for breaking through or correcting these obstacles. Therefore, although there is no hope that the overall environment in Shanghai will immediately return to its original state, the complete or partial smooth flow of wealth and goods is indeed possible at any time. Those who are getting rich now by hoarding will see bankruptcy due to the sudden smooth flow of wealth and goods. Not only that, but preventing the smooth flow of wealth and goods is only one aspect of human obstacles; what can be valued can also be devalued, and another aspect of human obstacles is easy dumping. The wealth that those who are currently getting rich are making is actually the remaining drops from the damming; once the human obstacles change their style, collecting goods from all over the place and using dumping methods to collect Shanghai's wealth, how can the wealth and goods currently owned by the wealthy people withstand the storms of dumping!

Second, the reason why rising prices and making money in all industries is often beneficial to the entire national economy is that mutual stimulation of production and continuous regeneration create a prosperous scene. Of course, a large part of the money earned by Shanghai's industries and businesses last year came from the mainland, earned from products, which can be grandly described as wealth flowing from all over the world. However, it is undeniable that a large part of it also comes from seizing the residents of this port and sucking their blood. Since Shanghai became an isolated island, it has long become a special consumption area. Making a lot of money in a consumption area only concentrates wealth and exacerbates poverty. Within a few tens of miles, the rich get richer but are ultimately few in number, and the poor get poorer and become more numerous every day. How will this make the society increasingly unbalanced, threaten its security, and gradually degrade its morality? All of this is what the wealthy do not want to consider, thinking that solid iron doors and iron boxes, trusted bodyguards and strong servants, are enough to deal with everything and ensure complete safety. In fact, social economy and private wealth each have their limits; there is no satisfaction, and poverty has its extreme. Among all industries, few rely mainly on wealthy families as customers, and most rely on ordinary customers. How can the continued prosperity of business in the past one or two years be maintained if the society becomes poorer and the poor become more extreme? According to people in business, the amount earned by each industry last year was larger in the second half of the year, but the market was still better in the first half of the year. The first half of the year was better due to the purchasing power reflected by the social economy; the second half of the year was larger due to the "horizontal rise and expansion" of inventory. Based on this trend, the gradual decline of the market this year is inevitable. To say that wealth can be made indefinitely even if the market is declining, how can this be possible in the world, how can this be reasonable? Therefore, we should not regard this year as the third year of prosperity for all industries, but we must prepare for the first year of decline and depression. The universal price increases of the New Year only make general life more difficult, which also promotes social depression and decline.

The above two points should be views within the scope of common sense. However, all industries and businesses, encouraged and hinted at by the past one or two years, ignore this common sense. They still think that as long as they have goods, they can buy them at high prices and still make a big profit. This makes the unreasonable soaring of prices excessive, and as for how to recover the principal and profit, the changes in the environment and the poverty of the society will give the most ruthless answers!

### U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles Receives Ambassadors to Discuss Disarmament and Economic Issues; European Newspapers Comment on Welles' Visit to Europe

Washington – Undersecretary of State Welles received Belgian Ambassador Pontoux, Hungarian Minister Bélay, and Spanish Ambassador Cárdenas today to discuss disarmament and various international economic issues. According to diplomatic sources, the State Department will send notes to neutral countries this week regarding the economic organization and disarmament issues following the end of the European war, and has informed the envoys of the neutral countries of this intention. (Havas, 12th)

Washington – It was announced here today that U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles will be accompanied by Moffat, Chief of the European Division of the State Department, and Johnson, Secretary of the Embassy, during his visit to Europe. The itinerary for Welles' visit has not yet been determined and will depend on the government and shipping routes. It is said that Welles intends to travel to Europe on an Italian mail ship, as Italian ships are faster than American ships. (Haitong, 13th)

Moscow – The Soviet trade union newspaper "Labor News" recently commented on U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles' trip to Europe, stating: "This trip is of great significance. Although the United States has not participated in the Second Imperialist War, its capitalists are waiting for an opportune moment. In the meantime, they sell large quantities of munitions to the belligerent countries to reap huge profits. This is similar to the United States' avoidance of immediate participation at the beginning of the last imperialist war. Recalling the last European war, the late U.S. President Wilson sent his confidant, Colonel House, to Europe to investigate. At that time, he met separately with the deposed German Emperor Wilhelm II and the late British Foreign Secretary Grey and proposed a so-called 'plan to restore peace.' Who knew that after Colonel House's investigation and return to the United States, the U.S. actively joined the war. Therefore, Welles' visit this time is no different from what Colonel House did then. In short, it is to investigate the situation of the European war in order to profit from it and to test the path for the United States to participate in the war." (Havas, 13th)

Paris – The Radical Socialist Party's newspaper, "L'Œuvre," recently commented on U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles' inspection of Europe, stating that Welles is known for his opposition to National Socialism. When Hitler meets with him, he must either openly declare that Germany intends to conquer all of Europe and the Near East and demand a new distribution of colonies, thereby prompting the United States to become increasingly anti-German, or declare that he is prepared to accept reasonable peace terms. However, this is not something Germany is willing to do. For this reason, the German National Socialist Party is quite apprehensive about Welles' visit. Regarding the colonial issue, Hitler's advisors have drafted a detailed plan, pointing out that Belgium, the Netherlands, and Portugal do not have the ability to manage and develop their colonies, and advocating for the distribution of their colonies. As for the colonies of the defeated countries after Germany's victory, they must also be redistributed. However, the various principles upheld by the United States are contrary to this plan. Germany believes that the United States is indeed seeking a lasting basis for future peace, so its unease is growing day by day. (Havas, 13th)

Berlin – According to reliable sources, German leader Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini did not discuss the U.S. Undersecretary of State's visit to Europe on the phone last week. At the same time, the German and Italian foreign ministries exchanged views on this issue. Yesterday, the German Foreign Ministry continued to discuss President Roosevelt's peace movement, but the official side did not issue an opinion. (United Press, 13th)

The Hague – Regarding U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles' inspection of Europe, although the Dutch newspapers all express sympathy, they mostly express doubt about whether this move will succeed. The Catholic Party's "Maasbode" reported that Germany will welcome Welles' visit more than Britain and France. If the U.S. president puts forward a peace proposal in the future that is far from the war aims revealed by Britain and France and demands that they accept it, Britain and France will be in a dilemma. Germany, on the other hand, can negotiate with the United States at will if peace talks are actually beneficial and harmless. Therefore, its situation is better than that of Britain and France. This situation is certainly understood by Berlin. (Havas, 12th)

### U.S. Navy Department Requests Maximum Expansion of the Navy; Stark Speaks in the U.S. House of Representatives, Issues Warning Regarding the Far East Situation

Washington – According to U.S. Chief of Naval Operations Stark, who stated today at the House Appropriations Committee discussion of the naval budget: "Japan now controls all the seaports and major railway lines in China, and is also attempting to intensify its pressure on foreign concessions in China in order to establish its political and economic dominance in China. So far, Japan has only targeted Britain for attack, but Japan's plan is actually to dominate East Asia, so its ultimate goal is to expel all Western interests." Speaking of the current situation in the world, Admiral Stark advocated that the U.S. Navy should be made extremely powerful so that it would have sufficient capacity to respond in the event of an emergency. Therefore, the shipbuilding program must be implemented as soon as possible so that the defense force in the Pacific will not be weakened while paying attention to the European situation. Stark also stressed that the current U.S. Navy is far from being strong. According to Rear Admiral Moreell, Chief of the Bureau of Yards and Docks, the Navy Department now plans to spend four million U.S. dollars to improve the harbor of Guam so that it is suitable for aircraft and ships to anchor. (United Press, 13th)

### U.S. Embargo Range Against Japan and the Soviet Union; Senator Norris Advocates Expansion

Washington – Nebraska Senator Norris, a non-interventionist, recently stated that the U.S. government has already implemented a "moral embargo" against Japan and the Soviet Union, advising aircraft factories not to sell aircraft to these countries. This measure should be expanded to include all goods. As long as the American people and companies agree, there is no need to enact laws, and Japan and the Soviet Union cannot say that the U.S. government is taking "unfriendly actions." Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, also agreed with Norris's proposal and further advocated implementing a "legal embargo," saying that this move would be more effective than a "moral embargo." (Havas, 12th)

### The United States Needs Chinese Tin Ore

Washington – Yesterday's official announcement that Chinese tin ore exports will be used as collateral for new U.S. loans to China can be seen as another reason for the U.S. protest against the Japanese bombing of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. The U.S. Senate will vote today on general foreign debt procedures. People familiar with Far Eastern business say that most of China's tin ore is exported from Yunnan Province, and the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway is the main route for export abroad. China has become one of the U.S. sources of tin ore supply. In 1938, China ranked fourth in U.S. tin ore imports. From 1936 to 1938, China exported an average of 3,000 tons of tin ore to the U.S. each year. During the same period, the U.S. imported 80,000 tons of tin ore. In the first ten months of 1939, although China was affected by the prolonged Sino-Japanese War, China's exports of tin to the United States still reached 2,982 tons. (United Press, 13th)

Washington – This afternoon at 5:00 p.m., the U.S. Senate will vote on the U.S. loans to China and Finland. Senate leaders expect the bill to pass by a three-to-one margin. (United Press, 13th)

### The U.S. Does Not Need to Invoke the Neutrality Act for China, Japan, the Soviet Union, and Finland; Secretary of State Hull's Letter to Pittman

Washington – According to sources here today, U.S. Secretary of State Hull wrote to Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stating that he does not believe it is necessary to invoke the Neutrality Act for wars that are undeclared. There are two senators who advocate invoking the Neutrality Act for wars that are undeclared: one is Democrat Gillette, who advocates invoking the Neutrality Act for the Sino-Japanese War, and the other is Republican Senator Danaher, who advocates invoking the Neutrality Act for the Soviet-Finnish War. However, according to Hull, he firmly believes that the U.S. will not be drawn into either of these wars, so there is no need to invoke the Neutrality Act. (United Press, 13th)

### Japanese Diet Member Questions National Defense Plan; Minister of the Army Gives Vague Reply; Tense Atmosphere in the Diet

Tokyo – Seiyukai Party Diet member Makino urged Minister of the Army Hata Shunroku last night in the House of Representatives to explain the national defense plan so that the Diet could conduct appropriate research on the massive program of military expansion. The Minister of the Army repeatedly stated that, in view of the large scale of the war in China and the rapid changes in the international situation, this plan is the minimum required for national security. As for the content of this plan, it will not be announced. Makino expressed dissatisfaction with this answer, saying that in this case, we cannot continue to discuss the army budget bill. Hata Shunroku still said that he could not explain the army's military policy, and the atmosphere in the Diet became very tense. Minister of Colonial Affairs Koiso then spoke in the capacity of a retired soldier, saying that if the military plan were explained in detail, it would inevitably describe the strength of each division and the army, which would be revealing military secrets to the enemy. The audience applauded, and the storm subsided. (Reuters, 13th)

### Japanese House of Peers Discusses Electricity Problem

Tokyo – Today, the House of Peers held a plenary session and had a sincere discussion on the problem of electricity shortage in Japan. When Teishin Masanori answered the question of the famous financier Ogura, he expressed regret that the supply of electricity was insufficient for various important industries. An imperial edict has been invoked, and from February 10th, the electricity supply in central Japan will be reduced by 30%, and in western Japan by 35%. However, Teishin guaranteed that this reduction will be changed to 20% on February 20th. At the same time, the government will do its best to obtain 650,000 tons of coal in February and 500,000 tons in March. As for the cancellation of electricity supply restrictions, it will depend on whether the drought situation can improve and whether an average supply of fuel can be obtained. (Reuters, 13th)

### Total Value of Chinese Tea Exports to the Soviet Union

Chongqing – It was revealed here today that China's current tea exports to the Soviet Union account for about 70% of the total. The China Tea Company, formerly a joint government-business venture and now affiliated to the Foreign Trade Commission, has decided to increase its capital from 2 million yuan to 10 million yuan. All matters related to the production, manufacture, collection, transportation, and export of tea will be entrusted to the company. From January to November of last year, Chinese tea worth about 21 million Hong Kong dollars was shipped from Hong Kong, most of which was shipped to the Soviet Union to fulfill the barter agreement between the two countries.

### German-Soviet Trade Agreement Signed; Soviet Raw Materials Exchanged for German Industrial Products; Total Trade Between the Two Countries Will Increase Thereafter

Moscow – After successful negotiations, the Soviet Union and Germany signed an economic agreement yesterday. The draft of the economic plan and total trade between Germany and the Soviet Union was contained in the documents exchanged on September 28, 1939, by Molotov, Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars and Foreign Minister of the Soviet Union, and the German Foreign Minister. The economic agreement currently signed is in line with the wishes of the two governments for the aforementioned draft. The economic agreement stipulates that the Soviet Union will export raw materials to Germany in exchange for German industrial products. In the first year of implementation of the agreement, the total trade between the two countries will exceed any figure for trade between the two countries since the World War. It is said that the total trade will increase even more in the coming years. The signatories of the agreement were Mikoyan, Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Trade, Babirin, Soviet Commercial Representative to Germany, Litor, German Government Economic Representative, and Shinar, Chairman of the German Economic Investigation Group. (TASS, 12th)

Berlin – After publishing the official report on the German-Soviet trade agreement, the German authorities also issued the following commentary, solemnly pointing out that after Germany and the Soviet Union signed the trade agreement, they will definitely be able to restore the old economic relationship between Germany and the Soviet Union based on natural conditions. It stated, in brief, that Germany and the Soviet Union concluded a credit loan agreement last August and have now signed a trade agreement. In light of the developments in recent years, the trade relationship between Germany and the Soviet Union should have greater development. At the same time, when German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop visited Moscow for the second time on September 28, 1939, he exchanged documents with Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov, expressing their mutual desire to use all means to promote trade and economic relations between Germany and the Soviet Union. Part of this trade negotiation was held in Moscow and part in Berlin, and now it has been successfully concluded and an agreement has been reached. After the conclusion of the German-Soviet trade agreement, it is not only hoped that the economic relationship of the past will be restored, but also that further development will be promoted. The Soviet Union is rich in raw materials, and Germany has a developed industry. The economic agreement stipulates that the Soviet Union will exchange raw materials for German industrial manufactured products. In the future, large-scale economic development is extremely likely. (Haitong, 13th)

Amsterdam – "De Telegraaf" today carried a dispatch from Moscow stating that the German-Soviet trade agreement has now been officially signed. The German-Soviet trade negotiations began in early October 1939, when a German trade delegation went to Moscow. It was temporarily suspended at the end of November. At that time, the Soviet Union sent a trade delegation to Germany to investigate the industrial situation, and then resumed negotiations in Berlin, and then continued in Moscow, and now the agreement has been reached. The newspaper continued, in view of Britain's blockade measures, the German-Soviet large-scale trade agreement will definitely have a significant impact on the economy, politics and military of European countries. (Haitong, 13th)

The Hague – A telegram from Berlin carried by "De Telegraaf" here stated that the new German-Soviet trade agreement was signed in Moscow at the end of last week, stipulating that the total transaction volume is 1,000,000,000 marks. It is reported that the German business community will build several factories in the Soviet Union, including large-scale artificial rubber factories, and the goods shipped from the Soviet Union to Germany will be large quantities of grain, ore and kerosene. According to observers here, transportation difficulties may be the main obstacle to this agreement. (Reuters, 13th)

Berlin – Economic figures here estimate that the total trade between Germany and the Soviet Union will increase to 1,500,000,000 marks this year. This estimate is based on the speculation of official documents, that is, the trade volume in the first year after the signing of the new German-Soviet trade agreement will exceed the highest recorded year after the war. In 1931, Germany's (excluding Austria and the Sudetenland) total exports to the Soviet Union were 762,700,000 marks, and in 1930, Germany purchased Soviet goods worth 463,300,000 marks, excluding precious metals. According to official announcements, Germany will exchange industrial products for Soviet raw materials. It is generally expected that the value of German goods purchased from the Soviet Union and shipped to the Soviet Union will be equal. The goods to be exchanged have not been announced, but are roughly the same as before. In 1931, the total value of German machinery shipped to the Soviet Union was 290,000,000 marks. At the same time, Germany imported kerosene, grain, leather, ore (the most important of which is manganese ore) and timber. The economic and political importance of the new German-Soviet trade agreement can be compared with the trade figures of 1938 to prove it. In 1938, the value of German goods shipped to the Soviet Union was only 31,800,000 marks, and the total value of Soviet goods imported by Germany was only 47,400,000 marks. German economic experts believe that after the establishment of the new German-Soviet trade agreement, the British policy of blockading Germany will actually lose its effect. Although there are transportation difficulties in the exchange of huge amounts of goods between Germany and the Soviet Union, people from both countries are convinced that the development of railway transportation and Danube waterway transportation will be able to solve this transportation problem. (Haitong, 13th)

Oslo – According to "Morgenbladet," after the signing of the new German-Soviet trade agreement, Germany has shifted its trade center from Western Europe to Eastern Europe. The new German-Soviet trade agreement will increase Germany's import volume and reduce the effectiveness of the Anglo-German blockade policy. The Soviet Union will also purchase goods from Germany, so Britain and France will lose the Soviet market. (Haitong, 13th)

### German Celebrity Thyssen Deprived of Nationality; His Private Property Confiscated

Berlin – The German "Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" reported yesterday that German industrialist Thyssen and his wife have been deprived of German citizenship, but their children have not been subjected to the same punishment because they do not share their views. Thyssen is sixty-six years old this year and went to Switzerland with his wife. Thyssen's father was a leader in the German heavy industry, with the Ruhr area as the center of his business. He was a solitary character, but among the leaders of the German heavy industry, he was the first to support National Socialism. At that time, the National Socialist Party had not yet taken power, and Germany was still in economic difficulty. On January 26, 1933, Thyssen publicly supported Hitler's policies. Four days later, Hitler took the stage as German Chancellor. In November of that year, Thyssen became a member of the German lower house. He gave up political life in August 1939 and settled in Locarno. His private property has been confiscated by the German government. (Haitong News Agency, 13th)

### Germany Eagerly Demands Colonies; General Epp's Speech

Munich – General Epp, Chairman of the German Colonial League, said today, "Germany's demands regarding colonies will be determined by the outcome of this war." After 462 Germans who were engaged in colonial activities in Africa were expelled by the British authorities, they returned to Germany together and arrived here yesterday. The German Colonial League held a meeting to welcome them. In his speech, Epp said that it is distressing that Germans cannot occupy much-needed space, but Germans firmly believe that Germany's strength is sufficient to create the space it deserves. If the German people can be united in spirit and unwavering, they will surely achieve their goal. (Haitong, 13th)

### Romania's Oil Supply to Germany Not to Exceed Quota; Assurances Provided to Britain and France

London - According to diplomatic sources here, the German government recently requested the Romanian government to increase the amount of oil sold to Germany as stipulated in the German-Romanian economic agreement, from 1.25 million tons to 2 million tons. The Romanian government firmly refused, indicating that Germany's oil supply is becoming increasingly difficult to obtain and that Romania is unwilling to take any actions that would contravene the interests of Britain and France. Furthermore, the German ambassador to Romania, Fabricius, strongly asserted to the Romanian government that Germany harbored no intention of aggression and was prepared to guarantee Romania against external attacks, supposedly referring to the threat from the Soviet Union. This was also known by the Romanian government, but since the Balkan Entente nations expressed their solidarity recently, Romania feels its position has been strengthened and fears no threats from Germany or the Soviet Union. Consequently, Prime Minister Tătărescu provided concrete assurances to the British and French ambassadors, declaring that Romania's oil sales to Germany would not exceed the quantity stipulated in the German-Romanian economic agreement. Simultaneously, a formal note would be submitted to the British and French governments within the next week. In short, the Romanian government's attitude is satisfying to Britain and France, making it unnecessary to exert pressure. Once the "Eastern Army" is organized, Britain and France can support Romania, Greece, and Turkey if necessary, which are Britain and France's allies in the Balkan Peninsula. It can be asserted that Romania's attitude will become even more resolute at that time. (Havas, 13th)

### Italian Heavy Industry Temporarily Suspends Accepting Foreign Orders; Outcome of Supreme National Defense Council Discussion

Rome - As a result of several days of meetings by the Supreme National Defense Council, it is reported that Italian heavy industry will temporarily suspend accepting foreign orders. Consequently, the purchasing commissions of various countries in Italy, including the British commission, will inevitably cease operations. Since the outbreak of the war, Italian factories have uniformly accepted orders from both neutral and belligerent countries without discrimination. Germany is unlikely to welcome this, given that Italy is supplying military goods to Britain and France. The Director-General of the Economic Affairs Department of the German Foreign Ministry, Clodius, has been in Rome for several days in discussions with the Italian authorities, and has not yet left, presumably related to this matter. Therefore, the extent to which Italy's change in attitude is influenced by Germany is a matter of speculation. (Havas, 12th)

Rome - The Italian Supreme National Defense Administrative Council convened again last night, the fourth meeting in five days, chaired by Prime Minister Mussolini, lasting two and a half hours before adjourning. It is reported that a decision has been made to intensify the implementation of various plans to ensure Italy's national defense reaches the highest level of preparedness to respond to any changes.

### Heavy Snowfall in Holland; Unprecedented Cold

Amsterdam - Heavy snow continued to fall in Holland last night. This winter is the coldest season in Holland. According to reports from the Dutch Meteorological Institute, this winter has broken the record for the coldest in Holland set in 1855 and 1891. The level of the Waal River, 20 miles downstream from Nijmegen, is ten inches higher than usual due to the accumulation of flowing water, leading to an increasingly severe flood that is brewing.

### Australian Expeditionary Force Arrives in the Near East for Joint Defense; Anglo-French Eastern Army to be Formed Soon; Defense Against Possible Soviet-German Offensive

Cairo - After the second contingent of Australian troops arrived at a port in the Near East yesterday, the British Ambassador to Egypt, Lampson, read a proclamation from the King of England, stating in brief that twenty-five years ago, Australian troops were summoned to serve for freedom and justice and crossed the sea to earn an unforgettable reputation. Today, you are the vanguard of the second Australian army to come to Europe, re-entering the battlefield to uphold the same principles. Several Australian soldiers told a Reuters reporter that the journey was extremely interesting and that the troopship was welcomed everywhere, and the friendship between the Australian soldiers and the French escort ship's crew was a highlight of the journey. (Reuters, 13th)

London - Evening newspapers here are currently carrying headlines stating that the expeditionary forces from the Dominion of New Zealand and the Commonwealth of Australia have arrived in the Near East. Among the New Zealand troops, there are also many Maori natives, whose fathers or elder brothers had served with distinction in the Western European and Turkish Gallipoli front lines during the last European war. Another regiment is being trained in New Zealand but has not yet been deployed. As for the Commonwealth of Australia expeditionary force, it is officially named the Second Expeditionary Force of the Commonwealth of Australia of the British Empire, to distinguish it from the expeditionary force of 1914. However, in reality, many Australians who participated in the last European war have been asked to depart again this time, so it is not easy to make a strict distinction between the two expeditionary forces. Currently, a portion of the New Zealand Dominion Army soldiers and a portion of the Commonwealth of Australia airmen are undergoing training in England, but the majority have already arrived in the Near East to join British and Indian troops in defending tropical desert areas or mountainous regions. Regarding this matter, well-informed sources in London recently stated that a large number of troops from various places and of different races are currently stationed in the Near East, including Egypt, Aden, Palestine, Syria, and Lebanon, gradually forming a defensive line under the flags of the Anglo-French allies. The largest number of troops are French troops stationed in Syria, totaling several divisions. The British troops stationed in Egypt and Iraq are the next largest (the number of British troops in Iraq has recently been increased). The total number of troops is increasing daily, and the military equipment is also being improved daily. In the event that the Near East is threatened with aggression, this force can be concentrated at any location at any time. If the 600,000 troops of the Turkish army were to join the war to aid Britain and France or to assist other Balkan Entente countries in defending against aggression, then the Anglo-French troops stationed in the Near East would come to their aid. In short, although the organization of the "Eastern Army" is not yet complete, if the Soviet Union attacks Romania or takes military action in the Near East, or if Germany engages in aggression in the Balkan Peninsula, the strength of the "Eastern Army" is already capable of repelling it. It can be seen that Britain and France have fully utilized these several months to arrange defenses, whether on the main Western European front or elsewhere. If Germany expands its influence into the Scandinavian Peninsula to obtain the iron it needs, or into Romania to obtain oil, Britain and France will be able to respond calmly. (Havas, 12th)

### Japanese Diet Member Koyama Reproaches Arita for Yielding to Britain

Tokyo - During today's session of the House of Representatives Budget Committee, Diet member Koyama expressed great dissatisfaction with Arita's foreign policy, believing that Arita's diplomacy has consistently been a policy of yielding to Britain, and stated that the presence of British troops in Shanghai is a completely illegal act, as no treaty allows Britain to have the right to station troops in Shanghai. Arita replied that he did not wish to discuss this issue. Koyama continued, saying that Arita must bear some responsibility for Hiranuma's resignation, so Arita should not remain in office in the Yonai cabinet. At the same time, the Japanese people can no longer trust Arita's diplomacy of constantly yielding to Britain. Koyama concluded by saying that Britain must be held responsible for the sinking of the "Terukuni Maru." Arita replied that he could not be held responsible for the resignation of the Hiranuma cabinet. As for the sinking of the "Terukuni Maru," the responses from the British and German governments have been unsatisfactory, so he is still awaiting explanations from the British and German governments. (United Press, 13th)

### Focus on the Yen Bloc Economic Plan; Sakurauchi Answers Diet Member's Questions

Tokyo - During the session of the House of Representatives Budget Committee on the 12th, Seiyukai Diet member Ogasa Wara Saburo engaged in the following Q&A with Finance Minister Sakurauchi regarding the Yen Bloc economic plan: Ogasa Wara asked, "What is the status of the Yen Bloc economic plan?" Finance Minister Sakurauchi replied, "The first phase of the plan is currently underway." Ogasa Wara asked, "What happened to the initially set exchange fund of 300 million yuan?" Finance Minister Sakurauchi replied, "It now stands at 386 million yuan, and the amount utilized to date is 576 million yuan, which has contributed significantly to export trade." Ogasa Wara asked, "Does the Japanese government consider it appropriate for the banknotes of the United Reserve Bank in North China to be exchanged with the yen at par?" Finance Minister Sakurauchi replied, "It is most necessary to maintain the value of the United Reserve Bank notes and to maintain this special price of the yuan for the sake of military necessity in North China's relationship with Japan. Therefore, there will be sufficient consideration for maintaining the value of these United Reserve Bank notes." Ogasa Wara asked, "The circulation of military scrip in Central and South China is limited to urban areas. If the Yangtze River is opened up, third countries will use francs to purchase goods. In that case, won't the area of circulation of military scrip become increasingly smaller?" Finance Minister Sakurauchi replied, "In the future, a new central government will be established in China, so although a new issuing bank may not emerge immediately, it will eventually come out. At that time, this bank will have to establish what kind of countermeasures, and Japan always embraces the function of assisting this new issuing bank to carry it out." Ogasa Wara asked, "If this also follows the example of the United Reserve Bank notes and is linked to the yen at par, then Japan will increase its burden again. I wonder what concrete measures the government has?" Finance Minister Sakurauchi replied, "Once a new central government is established, a new bank will inevitably emerge. Therefore, in order to achieve a sound currency issuance, the preparatory work will be carried out appropriately and without regret." (Domei, 13th)

### Japan and the Netherlands to Revise Arbitration Treaty

Tokyo - Official circles announced that the Japanese government has asked the Dutch government to begin negotiations to revise the arbitration and conciliation treaty between the two countries. The current treaty has "a slight technical adjustment necessary," so Japan has now formally taken steps to abolish this treaty on August 11. However, before the current treaty expires, Japan "hopes to conclude a new revised treaty." The Japanese side firmly stated that Japan's abolition of this treaty has no political motivation.

### Soviet Army Launches Major Offensive; Fierce Fighting on All Finnish Fronts; Summa Town Reduced to Rubble; Sweden Strengthens Northern Defense Line

Helsinki - The intense pressure exerted by the Soviet side on the Mannerheim Line has lasted for twelve days and continues unabated. Although the Finnish side shows no signs of weakness, the defending troops are clearly becoming fatigued. According to the communique issued last night, the Summa front, only seven or eight miles wide, is currently under simultaneous attack by several Soviet divisions, estimated to be 30,000 to 40,000 men advancing. It is reported that the Soviet army is using metal shields approximately two feet wide during the advance. According to eyewitnesses, the Finnish defenses of the Summa fortress are still bravely defending after heavy artillery bombardment in the past 24 hours. (Reuters, 13th)

Helsinki - The General Headquarters has just issued a battle report stating: (1) In the Karelian Isthmus, the Red Army continues to attack with all its might, and fierce fighting continues. Several Red Army divisions on the Summa front, under the cover of artillery fire, launched a major offensive, supported by aircraft and mechanized units. At the same time, Red Army units in the Muolaanjärvi sector also launched a fierce attack on our army positions along the Vuoksi River, led by 150 tanks. As of this afternoon, both sides are still engaged in fierce fighting. As for the Taipale River basin, the Red Army first bombarded our army positions with artillery for four hours, and then infantry attacked. Our army immediately engaged in a desperate battle and repelled them. (2) In the Lake Ladoga area, the Red Army crossed the lake and the Gulf of Finland, attempting to outflank our army positions, but was repelled by the fierce bombardment from our coastal fortresses. In total, the Red Army suffered heavy losses on all fronts yesterday. In terms of tanks alone, 72 were lost. In the battle northeast of Lake Ladoga, the Red Army suffered 380 casualties. (3) In the air, our aircraft flew to Red Army concentration points and bombed military camps, and engaged in combat with enemy aircraft. As for Soviet aircraft, they were also very active. Nine of them were shot down by our side, of which three have not yet been confirmed. (Havas, 12th)

Stockholm - According to information received here, the town of Summa, the center of the Soviet army's major offensive, is now nothing but ruins. Judging from the Soviet army's continued fierce attacks, the Soviet commander seems to be exhausting all his efforts in a desperate gamble, hoping to break through the Mannerheim Line before the end of February, as heavy snowfall will make it impossible for the war to make any progress at that time. (Reuters, 13th)

Copenhagen - According to news from Helsinki obtained here today, as a result of Finnish reconnaissance, Soviet troops behind the Karelian Isthmus are now continuously moving to the front lines. According to Finnish estimates, the Soviet army concentrated in the Karelian sector has 300,000 men, while the Finnish troops in that area number only 200,000. (United Press, 13th)

Stockholm - Well-informed sources say that the fighting on the Finnish front has indeed become more intense in recent days, especially on the 11th of this month, which was the fiercest seen since the outbreak of the Finnish-Soviet war. After the Red Army deployed five fresh divisions to reinforce the Karelian Isthmus, it launched a major counter-offensive on the front line, attempting to break through the Mannerheim Line from Summa to Lake Vuoksi. As for the Southern Suotamo sector, after thirteen days of fierce fighting, the Red Army has occupied the Finnish army's positions and has gained an important stronghold between Muolaanjärvi and Lake Vuoksi, attempting to attack from the flank. However, the Finnish army has launched a major counter-offensive and, as of noon yesterday, both sides were still engaged in fierce fighting. (Havas, 13th)

Moscow - According to a communique from the headquarters of the Leningrad Military District, there was reconnaissance activity on the front line on the 12th. In several sectors, there was intense action between infantry and artillery on both sides. In the Karelian sector, Soviet troops operated successfully, capturing 32 fortresses, including 11 strong forts. In the past few days, Soviet troops have inflicted heavy losses on the enemy in the fortified area. The Soviet army captured 230 machine guns and 82 artillery pieces. As for the Soviet air force, it only made reconnaissance flights due to adverse weather conditions. (TASS, 13th)

Helsinki - Responsible sources here refuted the Soviet claim that Finnish army positions had been captured in Karelia, calling it completely groundless. The city of Viipuri in southeastern Finland was heavily bombarded by Soviet artillery on Sunday evening. The city's power plant was slightly damaged, causing a power outage, but it was repaired shortly thereafter. (Reuters, 13th)

Stockholm - Newspapers here report that several British aircraft have joined the Finnish air force to fight against Soviet aircraft. (Haitong News Agency, 13th)

Amsterdam - According to a "Southern News" correspondent in London, Britain will intensify its aid to Finland, even at the cost of severing diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. The military correspondent of the "Yorkshire Post" believes that sending regular troops to aid Finland requires parliamentary approval, so only sending volunteers can be considered. (Haitong News Agency, 13th)

London - Finnish sources in London claimed last night that many people in Britain have filled out volunteer forms, willing to go to Finland to fight. However, as of now, no British volunteers have departed for Finland. (Reuters, 13th)

London - A Daily Mail correspondent in Stockholm reports that the Bothnia Line in northern Sweden, which defends Scandinavia's west and central regions against Soviet threats, is currently undergoing intense work and preparation. The central Bothnia fort was built between 1900 and 1902 and has now been completely modernized. The Swedish-Finnish border north of the Gulf of Bothnia is currently under its control. In front of the defense line, dozens of new bunkers and gun emplacements have been added. There are no key passes from Finland to the Swedish border except for a railway north of the Gulf of Bothnia. This railway is also now under the control of the Bothnia fort. Swedish forts are equipped with new heavy artillery and large batches of anti-aircraft guns, all manufactured by Bofors, the best products in the world. There are two railway lines between the forts for transportation. Although the number of troops guarding this northern Swedish fortress has not been officially announced, it is reported to be over 70,000 men. (Reuters, 13th)

### German Ship Scuttled off Brazilian Coast; "Wakama" Sent SOS Before Sinking; Cargo Valued at Over One Million US Dollars

New York - The German ship "Wakama" (3,771 tons) was scuttled off the coast of Brazil yesterday, thirteen hours after departing from Rio de Janeiro. It is reported that the ship took this action after spotting the British 9,800-ton cruiser "Hawkins." This cruiser had served in the British fleet in China several years ago. As for the fate of the ship's 43 crew members, information here is inconsistent. Some newspapers report that they were rescued by the British cruiser, while others claim that they all perished. Yesterday afternoon, a distress message sent by the German ship before it sank was received here, relayed by the Spanish cargo ship "Aligamenti," which is incomprehensible. According to the "Aligamenti's" telegram, it was 48 miles from the scene when it received the distress message, so it sailed to the rescue, but when it arrived at the scene, the German ship was nowhere to be seen. The "Wakama" was fully loaded with cargo when it sank, valued at US$1.25 million. The ship arrived in Rio de Janeiro one week before the war and was the last German ship to leave the Brazilian capital. (Reuters, 13th)

### Neutral Ships Continue to be Sunk; Dutch Indignation Towards Germany

Amsterdam - The Norwegian 2,588-ton ship "Nidarholm" recently sank after hitting a mine off the west coast of England. The crew jumped into lifeboats and were rescued by another Norwegian ship. Furthermore, it was learned here yesterday afternoon that the British 204-ton patrol boat "Bayer" was destroyed by German aircraft bombs. After the crew jumped into lifeboats, they landed on the northeast coast of England. (Haitong News Agency, 13th)

London - The Swedish ship "Osloania" (1,854 tons) sank in the North Sea today, presumably torpedoed by a submarine. A British warship heard the alarm and immediately sailed to the rescue, and has rescued ten crew members. (Havas, 13th)

Amsterdam - The official confirmation that the Holland-America Line ship "Burgdyk" (6,853 tons) was attacked by a German submarine-launched torpedo has now been received, and Dutch people are outraged. It is reported that the cargo on the ship was mostly consigned to the Dutch government, including a large batch of grain. The remaining 10% was fabric purchased by Dutch importers. The ship was sailing to Rotterdam and did not intend to stop at any foreign port, so there was no question of carrying contraband. People here view this incident as a more blatant act of Germany violating international law, more brutal than the recent torpedoing of the Madalena, a ship carrying non-contraband to South Africa. The "Burgdyk" is the thirteenth ship lost by the Netherlands in this European war, and this is the third Dutch ship to be torpedoed. (Reuters, 13th)

### US Treasury Department's Power to Purchase Silver; Townsend Bill Sparks Reaction from Silver Group

Washington - A bill proposed last year by Republican Senator Townsend, which seeks to abolish the Treasury Department's power to purchase foreign silver, has been approved by a subcommittee of the Senate Banking Committee and will be reviewed by the full Banking Committee tomorrow. If it passes again, it will be submitted to the Senate for discussion. A senator belonging to the silver group, who usually supports the government's current foreign policy, released a statement to the press opposing the Townsend Bill, stating in brief that silver is a major export of China, and China's financial stability is best guaranteed by it. The Export-Import Bank can also accept it as collateral when extending new credit loans to China. If the purchase of foreign silver is stopped at this time, it would greatly harm China. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee just recently approved the Export-Import Bank's capital increase bill, thereby supporting the movement to financially aid China. Under these circumstances, the government should do its utmost to oppose the Townsend Bill in the Senate Banking Committee. If this bill is submitted to the Senate for discussion in the future, the government should also exert pressure on the Senate to quash it. (Havas, 12th)

### US Aviation Industry Steps Up Production

Washington - It is reported that the US aviation industry will supply countless aircraft to the US Air Force and foreign governments within a month.

### The Japanese Army Individually Occupies Dinghai as a Center for Large-Scale Smuggling - and Has Designated Shenjiamen as a Special Zone

The Millard's Review states that Zhoushan Island is located outside Hangzhou Bay off the coast of Zhejiang, 120 miles south of Shanghai. For two years after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the islanders lived as usual, undisturbed by the fighting on the mainland. They thought that the Japanese might "ignore" the Zhoushan Islands because they were unimportant in all aspects. However, on June 23 last year, the Japanese finally invaded Zhoushan Island and occupied the important port of Dinghai, and the Zhoushan Islands were no longer part of "Free China."

Initially, the Japanese did not covet the Zhoushan Islands because they were busy invading coastal and inland cities, and because the islands' grain production was hardly enough to feed the islanders for four months of the year, and a large amount of rice was shipped in from Haimen, Zhejiang every year. The main products of the Zhoushan Islands are rice and sweet potatoes, as well as peanuts and beans, but the quantity is small. The islanders also raise chickens and turkeys. In addition, many islanders produce salt, but the salt-making methods are primitive, so the output is small and the salt tax revenue is also small.

The mountains on the Zhoushan Islands are extremely barren and fuel is scarce. The islanders often ship in a large amount of charcoal from Haimen. As far as is known, the Zhoushan Islands neither produce coal nor have mineral sand. Only a small portion of the islanders are engaged in fishing, and their fishing methods are also backward. The fish caught is very small and cannot compete with the marine products of any Japanese fishing base. In terms of economics, there is also reason to believe that the Zhoushan Islands should not be disturbed. A certain Catholic nun once said humorously that the Japanese might mistakenly believe that the Zhoushan Islands have economic importance, and the islanders should erect large signs along the coast with the words "No food, no coal, please do not land."

In military terms, the Zhoushan Islands do not cause the Japanese any anxiety, because in addition to an old fort with a cannon made before 1842 before the Opium War, there are no other forts, and except for a few basements that are not intended to be used, there are no fortifications. As for armed forces, there are only self-defense groups and armed police to maintain general security in Dinghai and the Zhoushan Islands. After the Opium War from 1842 to 1845, the British army occupied the islands, but when Britain obtained Hong Kong, it abandoned them. Japan can enter and occupy the Zhoushan Islands at any time, and the question now is what Japan has gained from the islands since June 23, 1939. To answer this question, it is necessary to trace back to the strict restrictions imposed by the Chongqing central government on certain goods shipped from Shanghai to Ningbo and then to Free China, and the imposition of taxes on goods shipped into and out of Ningbo. Furthermore, since last autumn, foreign goods have had to be settled in Ningbo rather than Shanghai, so Ningbo has replaced Shanghai as the center of tax collection and maintaining Chinese currency. The income lost by the central government in Shanghai has been compensated for in Ningbo. In order to deal with this situation, the Japanese maintained control of the Zhoushan Islands. Looking at the map, it can be seen that the islands' position is crucial to Ningbo and has value in terms of transportation to the neighboring mainland. Since China has no navy to patrol and control the coastline, the Japanese can turn the Zhoushan Islands into a center for large-scale smuggling of goods into the Chinese mainland. According to information gathered by the writer from various sources, large sailing ships are now hired to transport fish and other marine products from Shenjiamen on Zhoushan Island to Shanghai. When they arrive in Shanghai, they are unloaded at the Yangshupu fish market wharf, and then they load other goods and sail back to Shenjiamen, where they are loaded onto fishing boats and transported to various coastal locations, and then smuggled into the Chinese mainland.

Large quantities of contraband are smuggled in and out of Zhenhai, Chaiqiao, Chuanshan, Xiangshan, Jingnan, Juexi, and Fenghua in this way. Goods smuggled out of Free China are mostly tung oil, alum, leather, tea, raw cotton, ramie, flax, cottonseed oil, mustard oil, tar, and animal intestines. Goods smuggled into Free China are cigarettes, cotton yarn, matches, kerosene, and paper. Shenjiamen has become a prosperous commercial center due to the smuggling of goods. In Shanghai cigarettes alone, the monthly tax revenue has reached about 80,000 yuan. The population there is gradually increasing, and it is easier to make money. Ships sail to Shenjiamen from all directions, and its prosperity is no less than that of the Nanshi district of Shanghai before the war. The Japanese have designated the area as a "special zone." At this point, the aforementioned question has been answered. The Japanese occupied the Zhoushan Islands not because they have military importance, but to disrupt China's financial system. Now the Zhoushan Islands have an economic importance that they did not have before, but only as a center for large-scale smuggling.

### Japanese Warships Invade Liuheng Island Outside Xiangshan Port - Repelled by Garrison

Dinghai News: Liuheng Island, which belongs to the county, is located outside Xiangshan Port, 39 miles southeast of the county seat. After being isolated on the sea, Japanese warships sailed to harass it on the afternoon of August 28 last year. At the end of last month, a small Japanese warship sailed to the sea off Shuangyu Port on Liuheng Island and lowered a motorboat, speeding towards the shore, attempting to land. The local garrison immediately resisted, and the Japanese soldiers returned fire with light machine guns. As a result, eight Japanese soldiers were killed, and the Japanese soldiers began to flee.

### Suzhou "Huaxing" Branch - Plans to Establish "Farmers' Production Cooperative"

Suzhou News: Last May, "Huaxing Bank" added a branch in Suzhou, but since its establishment, no one has paid attention to it, resulting in extremely sluggish business. Xu Xun'gong, the deputy general manager of the bank, recently planned to establish a farmers' production cooperative in this county, specializing in absorbing the rural economy. It is also reported that the cooperative will be established in the silkworm and mulberry season this spring, but since the fall of this county, hundreds of thousands of farmers have gone bankrupt, and now they are being squeezed again, and they will inevitably be left to die.

### Yesterday's Rice Market Opened Strong: Foreign Rice Prices Soared; Lunar New Year's Domestic Rice Arrivals Scarce; Group Orders for Foreign Rice Became Crowded

The Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association's rice merchants' tea market, after completing its year-end summary for the 28th year, resumed business yesterday morning at 9:00 AM. Trading began strong but slowly until 11:00 AM. The Market Management Committee issued a special public notice: (1) Notice No. 112: For the purpose of this notice, all those buying and selling in this market must still adhere to the market trading regulations and first provide samples to the public sample office for certification and trading. If a transaction occurs, a transaction form must be used as proof, and brokers must also use brokerage certificates. Without these procedures, in case of disputes, mediation will not be accepted, and the matter will be investigated. Furthermore, the order of buying and selling must strictly follow the prescribed order: customers sell to merchants, and merchants sell to shops, following established practices. No irregular transactions are allowed. Anyone who dares to violate this rule will be severely investigated. All are expected to comply with this notice. (2) Notice No. 113: For the purpose of this notice, all those buying and selling in this market must fulfill their various obligations. It has been resolved by the general assembly that all obligations for domestic rice trading, previously stipulated, should be implemented as usual. From the opening of the market, foreign rice trading will be weighed by 160 catties, and pricing should also be handled according to domestic rice standards, deducting 1% for public fees, 1% for refugee donations, 1% for the bushel office relief fund, and 0.1% for sample rice, to ensure equal treatment. Furthermore, the refugee donation item must be universally paid. Regardless of repeated transfers, deductions must be made step by step. If deductions are made without issuing receipts, or if receipts are transferred, reporting is encouraged for investigation. This notice.

Harsh and Complex Taxes and Levies: A General Overview

The Japanese puppet regime, in its desire to extract economic resources from the occupied areas, has imposed controls on the export and re-export of any local products and the import of non-local goods. It has also levied harsh and complex taxes, imposing multiple layers of oppression, making life unbearable for the people. Rice-producing areas in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, except for a portion of Jiangbei, are all under their oppressive control. Last year, the Japanese army required those procuring goods in the occupied areas to obtain procurement permits, for which a large handling fee had to be paid. These permits were only issued by the Tsuchibashi unit in Hangzhou and the Koya unit in Suzhou, making the procedure extremely troublesome. The "Pacification Team" in Suzhou levied a tax of 7.3 yuan per shi on the outward transport of rice. After reaching Shanghai, the Japanese army also levied a "military rice" tax, confiscating it all. As a result, the source of domestic rice is extremely scarce.

Market Opening: Foreign Indica Rice Soars

The rice market reopened yesterday morning at 10:00 AM. After being closed for ten days, prices soared. Foreign indica rice opened at 46 to 48 yuan, an increase of about 6 yuan. Other white japonica and native indica rice were not available on the market due to price controls.

The Regulatory Association Continues to Order the Sixth Batch

The Shanghai People's Food Regulation Association handles the ordering of foreign rice to regulate the people's food supply. After the first batch of 6,000 bags arrived in Shanghai, they have now been completely retrieved. Yesterday, the sixth batch was ordered, bringing the total to 24,500 bags of foreign rice. The second batch of 10,000 bags is expected to arrive in Shanghai within days. Applications for ordering from various industries have become crowded again due to soaring rice prices.

### Spring Festival Comfort: Donations Pour In

The Spring Festival Comfort Fund, after the fundraising committee solicited donations from various industries, has achieved excellent results in two weeks. As of yesterday, donations from various industry groups have exceeded 200,000. It is reported that major industrial and commercial groups in the city, as well as their member shops and firms, deeply understand righteousness in the abnormal development of the isolated island. They enthusiastically contribute, and many industries had significant surpluses last year. Therefore, they are extremely willing to bear and contribute to this comfort fund. Many colleagues have also promoted fundraising, exceeding the prescribed amount. Furthermore, the public in various circles of the city also actively donated voluntarily after the banks opened yesterday.

### Negotiations on Building Roads Beyond the Boundary: Agreement to be Signed Soon; Shanghai Municipal Council Information Office Releases News; Rumors Regarding the Contents of the Agreement are Not Accurate

According to the Shanghai Municipal Council Information Office, the Director-General and Chairman of the Council officially stated that the full text of the agreement on building roads beyond the boundary, published in the English "North China Daily News" on the night of the 12th, is not accurate. The agreement is expected to be signed soon.

Rumored Four Articles of Agreement

According to the "Continental Times," the Shanghai Municipal Council Information Office issued a brief report yesterday (the 12th). It acknowledges that the full text of the agreement on building roads beyond the boundary published in the English "North China Daily News" is generally consistent with the facts, but does not deny that it is not accurate. The news received by the "Continental Times" yesterday morning is the same as that published in the English "North China Daily News," namely, the agreement is divided into four articles:

(1) The "Shanghai Special Municipal Government" establishes the "Shanghai Special Police Bureau" to manage the western district. This police bureau is an "independent organization," with a general bureau and sub-bureaus in the western district. No other police force can interfere with the jurisdiction of the "Special Police Bureau."

(2) The personnel of the "Special Police Bureau" are selected after consultation between the Shanghai Municipal Council and the "Shanghai Municipal Government," with some selected from the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department.

(3) To maintain close contact between the "Special Police Bureau" and other police forces, the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department assigns a liaison officer to facilitate communication. Matters related to foreigners within the jurisdiction of the new police bureau are handled by personnel from the new police bureau appointed by the Shanghai Municipal Council. However, important matters must be decided after consultation with the "Mayor of Shanghai."

(4) Regarding the administration of the "Special Police Bureau," if differences of opinion arise, they are decided after consultation between the senior police officers of the "Special Police Bureau" and the Chief of the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department. If a decision still cannot be reached, the matter must be discussed with the "Mayor of Shanghai."

When the "Continental Times" received the above news yesterday morning, it was said that this was not the final full text of the agreement that had been drafted, as the above four articles are preliminary in nature and only contain general conditions. More detailed conditions have been drafted subsequently.

Attempting to Resolve Police Authority in the Northern District

The status of the northern district of the Public Concession north of the Suzhou Creek, since the start of the "August 13th" incident, when it was occupied by the Japanese military authorities as a base of operations, the exercise of police administration by the Shanghai Municipal Council has been completely suspended for a time. Although negotiations have been conducted repeatedly since then, some police authority has been restored. However, because the obstacles have not been completely removed, a certain section of the area is still controlled by the Japanese military. According to news from Western officials close to the authorities of the Shanghai Municipal Council, the authorities of the Shanghai Municipal Council have long been negotiating with the Japanese side regarding the restoration of the status of the Hongkou, Yangshupu, and Suzhou Creek areas north of the Shanghai Municipal Council to their pre-war status of 1927. However, these negotiations have been conducted quite secretly, so few outsiders know about them. The initial plan was for the Japanese army to gradually remove the obstacles set up in the Hongkou, Yangshupu, and North Jiangxi Road areas, first restoring traffic, and then gradually reducing the number of Japanese sentry posts depending on the state of security, until complete withdrawal. However, the Japanese military authorities demanded a large increase in the number of Japanese police officers in the police stations in the northern district to assist in maintaining the safety of Japanese residents, and to have the right to conduct searches when deemed necessary. Negotiations between the two sides were intermittent and stalled for a long time, failing to achieve a close opportunity. Later, due to the serious dispute over the building of roads beyond the boundary in western Shanghai, it became even more difficult to break the deadlock in the northern district incident. However, the problem in western Shanghai awaits a final round of negotiations after the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Mr. Fessenden, returns to Shanghai from Dalian. Once a provisional agreement is reached on issues such as police authority, the problem in the northern district will naturally also continue to seek a solution.

### Those Injured in the Lone Army Barracks Incident: Concern from All Sides; Commander Xie Expresses Full Responsibility for the Injured

The Lone Army Barracks, due to the White Russian regiment setting up barbed wire fences without reason, had more than ten incidents of injuring civilians, which were reported in yesterday's newspaper. An investigation has revealed that the injured include Chen Yujin, 53 years old, businessman, residing at No. 1 Fu Lane, Singapore Road, suffered a fractured skull and severe injury to his left hand; Shi Huisheng, 35 years old, worker, residing at No. 38 Singapore Road, suffered a head injury, and injuries to his right arm and ring finger; Wu Dehua, 60 years old, residing at No. 20 First Refugee Shelter, Dunxin Road, a refugee, suffered a severe injury to his right hand and urgently needs medical treatment; Hui Ruhai, 50 years old, worker, residing opposite the Minsheng Rubber Factory, Pinlang Road, injured his right hand and urgently needs medical treatment; Jin Guilu, 32 years old, worker, residing at No. 6 Panjiafangzi, Triangular Shop, Tushanwan, suffered a severe injury to his right hand, is unable to move, and has a serious internal injury to his waist. The rest were dispersed by several police vehicles from the Gordon Road Police Station, with more than sixty Chinese and Indian police officers, and a curfew was imposed in the surrounding area. The injured returned for medical treatment on their own and are still being investigated. However, it is reported that this (13th) afternoon, citizens who read the newspaper learned of the incident and were extremely concerned about the injured. They actively brought cash and goods to Singapore Road to inquire about the injuries and experiences of the injured, and offered condolences. Commander Xie and all the officers and soldiers have sent personnel to investigate the injuries and transfer them to hospitals for treatment. Commander Xie stated that all medical expenses for the injured citizens will be fully covered. In addition to the initial condolence money of ten yuan given to each person, if their injuries prevent them from doing business or working and cause difficulties in family life, it will also be fully borne by Commander Xie personally. Commander Xie did not want to express any opinion on the incident, but said that the future hidden dangers and the unprovoked attacks on Chinese citizens by the White Russians will surely be effectively handled by the Shanghai Municipal Council. He hopes that those who have been injured and returned home will report the situation in detail as soon as possible.

### Shelter for Beggars: Director Du Solicits Donations; Large Quantities of Cotton Clothing and Bedding

The First Refugee Shelter of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, since it was taken over by the Salvation Army last July, has been actively reorganized and expanded. It now shelters more than 15,000 refugees. To provide greater assistance to the poor, twenty-six new grass sheds and a general office were built last November, increasing the shelter's capacity by more than 8,000 refugees. Recently, Major Masuyama and Director Du Baotian have found ways to open beggar rooms to shelter beggars wandering on the streets. There are now more than sixty beggars. The daily life of the shelter is still excellent. It provides a meal and a bowl of rice porridge with some vegetables every day. Captain Liu Junshi is responsible for the food supply. Recently, due to the severe cold weather, the shelter received more than 3,000 sets of cotton clothing and more than 2,000 cotton quilts from the Relief Association. Director Du Baotian also solicited more than 4,000 sets of cotton clothing from outside, which were distributed to the refugees for warmth. Those who benefited were very grateful.

According to another report, the Salvation Army's fundraising has reached its eighth round. Yesterday, a Chinese man generously donated 500 yuan, ranking first in this record. This person had previously donated 600 yuan. He requested that the 500 yuan be used to assist prisoners who had completed their sentences and were released from prison. Mr. Morley, the military officer of the army, immediately granted his request. Last night, the army distributed rice coupons to rickshaw pullers, valued at 5,000 yuan in national currency. It is said that each person could get five sheng of rice. The army plans to do the same a second time. The army plans to raise the predetermined 800 yuan by the end of this week. Anyone who wishes to donate can send it to No. 40 Sassoon House.

### Fog Disperses: Navigation Resumes; The "D'Artagnan" Arrives in Shanghai Today; Nearly 40,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Arrive

The fog has dispersed yesterday, and navigation has resumed. The Zhangjiakou vessel from South China and the Deping vessel returning to Shanghai from Zhenhai, which arrived at the mouth of Wusong the day before, were anchored outside the port due to the fog. They arrived at the port yesterday morning in succession. The French Postal Company's regular mail steamer "D'Artagnan" (transliteration) is rescheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 4:00 PM today and is scheduled to dock at the Hongkou Shuntai Wharf. Passengers will take the company's small boat, arriving at the New Customs Wharf at about 5:30 PM to disembark. The vessel loaded a large number of foreign rice bags in Saigon, totaling 39,100 bags, which will also be temporarily stored in the Shuntai Warehouse. The vessel will travel to Japan after unloading the cargo, and will return to Shanghai and return to Europe around the end of the month. Recently, there have been rumors that Japanese warships have gathered outside the mouth of Zhenhai to monitor the situation, but the Shanghai-Ningbo money ships are not affected. Moreover, the shipping company received a telegram from Ningbo reporting tranquility. The Hai Fu vessel of Reiss & Co. has safely arrived in Zhenhai. The Deping vessel of Zhongyi Company is scheduled to depart for Ningbo at 3:00 PM this afternoon. If loading is not completed, the departure may be rescheduled. The Feikang and Moufu vessels are expected to return to Shanghai today. The Moufu vessel is scheduled to depart for Zhenhai at 3:00 PM this Saturday afternoon.

### Spokesman for the Japanese Army in Shanghai: Acknowledges Defeat in Binyang; Calls it "Without Strategic Value"; Hence, Retreat from the Area has Begun

According to the Continental Times, a spokesman for the Japanese Army in Shanghai said yesterday (the 12th), based on a communiqué issued by the Japanese Southern China Command, that the Japanese army, having routed Chinese forces in Binyang and Wuming and the surrounding plains, had begun to withdraw from the area. Occupying towns and cities in these areas has no strategic value, so the Japanese army has decided that there is no need to station troops in the area. However, the Japanese army is determined to maintain the areas necessary to cut off the Chinese supply lines, such as Nanning. The Japanese army has no intention of occupying or expanding the areas outside Binyang and Wuming, but the Japanese army will enter any of the above-mentioned areas when necessary. The Japanese army also posted notices in hundreds of locations in Binyang and Wuming, stating that the Japanese army entered and exited the area so that the Chinese army could return to the area. If the Chinese army resists firmly and attempts to retake Nanning, the Japanese army is prepared to counterattack.

Japanese Soldiers Driven Back from Hangzhou Bay

According to the Continental Times, a spokesman for the Japanese Navy in Shanghai, when receiving reporters yesterday (the 12th), denied a report from the United Press in Chongqing that the Japanese army had twice attempted to land at Zhenhai on the south bank of Hangzhou Bay. It is said that there have been small battles on several islands of the Zhoushan Islands, but these battles have been ongoing for several months. According to military news from the Chinese side in Chongqing, on Friday night, three Japanese destroyers sent 200 soldiers to land in Hangzhou Bay. After being severely attacked by the Chinese defense forces, they retreated back to the warships. Three hours later, they sent soldiers again to attempt to land, but were driven back again.

### Japanese Military Police Twice Blockaded Transportation in Western Shanghai: Joffre Road Traffic Obstructed; Shanghai Municipal Council Not Notified in Advance

According to the English "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury," yesterday (the 12th) night, Japanese military police twice blockaded Joffre Road between Singapore Road and Avenue Petain, prohibiting all traffic, causing great panic among the residents of the area. The Japanese military police were acting on concession roads, without notifying the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department to request cooperation, nor notifying the volunteer corps stationed in the area in advance. Therefore, upon receiving the news, the volunteer corps dispatched troops to the area. The times when the Japanese military police blocked traffic were from 6:50 PM to 7:15 PM and from 8:50 PM to 9:05 PM. It was apparently because senior Japanese military officers were visiting the area that the Japanese military police blocked traffic, disregarding public inconvenience and bus delays. When the police department and the volunteer corps received the news and dispatched teams to the area, the first blockade of traffic had already ended, so the police and the volunteer corps returned. However, when the Japanese officers returned, traffic was blocked again.

According to the News Agency, around 8:00 PM the night before last, Japanese military police and "police" suddenly imposed a temporary curfew in the area of Avenue Haig and Rue du Père Huc in western Shanghai, which was lifted after two hours. It was later learned that the security was because Fujita, the commander of the Japanese Army in Shanghai, was visiting Wang Jingwei.

### Japanese Army Attempts to Relieve Encircling Chinese Troops in Xiaoshan: Fierce Fighting on Both Banks of the Qiantang River; Japanese Reinforcements Attempting to Cross the River Have Been Heavily Engaged; Chinese General Rushes to Take Command; Lunar New Year in Ningbo is Extremely Peaceful

According to a person from Hangzhou speaking to the reporter of Daguan News Agency, since the Japanese Tsuchibashi unit, together with the puppet troops of Xu Pucheng, attacked Xiaoshan in eastern Zhejiang, they have encountered strong resistance from the Chinese side, causing the Japanese and puppet troops to get bogged down in Xiaoshan and be unable to do anything. Now, the Japanese army is afraid that the troops entering Xiaoshan will be heavily encircled and annihilated by the Chinese army. So, starting the morning before, they installed artillery along the hills west of the Qiantang River and bombarded the area east of the river, firing more than a hundred shells in a quarter of an hour. They used cloth and rubber gas bags to build bridges on the Qiantang River Iron Bridge, which had been bombed and broken by Chinese aircraft, and charged forward with tanks, machine guns, and row cannons, attempting to cover the Japanese troops in the river with motorboats to forcefully cross the river and land. However, the Chinese army also fiercely counterattacked with machine guns and artillery, and the Japanese army was unable to cross the river. To reinforce the Japanese troops in Xiaoshan, from yesterday morning to the afternoon, the loud sounds of artillery and dense gunfire could still be clearly heard near the Hangzhou Railway Station. Some troops of the Japanese Tsuchibashi unit and the puppet troops of Xu Pucheng have retreated westward from the river. When the train arrived in Jiaxing, it saw more than a dozen trains full of Japanese troops newly transferred from the Beijing-Shanghai Line to reinforce the east of Zhejiang. It is heard that the highest authorities of the Chinese army have sent a general to sit in command of the fighting in eastern Zhejiang. It will not be difficult to annihilate the Japanese troops who tried to cross the river within the shortest possible time.

Crew Members of "Deping"

Discuss: The "Deping" of Zhongyi Company arrived in Shanghai on the 11th from Zhenhai. After anchoring overnight outside Wusong, it entered the port at 4:00 AM yesterday and docked at the Garden Wharf. It carried more than 600 passengers and more than 20,000 pieces of cargo. The vessel is scheduled to continue its voyage to Zhenhai at 4:00 PM this morning. According to the staff of the vessel, speaking to a reporter of the New Voice Agency,

The Eastern Zhejiang War

Since the Chinese army launched a counterattack during the Lunar New Year, they have broken into the city of Xiaoshan many times, and pasted propaganda slogans all over the city. At that time, the Japanese army resisted fiercely and launched fierce battles in the suburbs of the city. They also sent large numbers of Japanese aircraft to bomb the four suburbs of Xiaoshan. Unexpectedly, the bombed areas were mostly the positions of the miscellaneous troops recruited by the Japanese side, causing more than a thousand casualties among the miscellaneous troops. Now, Xiaoshan is still tightly surrounded by the Chinese army. The Japanese army in Xiaoshan has become a turtle in a jar. Large numbers of Chinese troops are waiting for an opportunity to attack and wipe them out in one fell swoop. Therefore, in recent days, things seem to be calm on the surface, but in reality, they are preparing everything and it will not be difficult to completely clear the area. As for Zhenhai

The Situation at Xiepu

The Japanese army's landing was not as serious as rumored. At 10:00 PM on the 10th, the Japanese army attempted to land at the place by motorboats, numbering no more than a few dozen. After observing their intentions, it was entirely due to the failure of the war in Xiaoshan. They attempted to cause chaos in the rear in order to relieve the encirclement of Xiaoshan. But they did not know that the defenses there were tight. The Chinese army had already been prepared. When the Japanese army approached the land, they were immediately met with a head-on attack, and the entire Japanese army was repelled on the spot. At that time, the sound of gunfire could be clearly heard in both Ningbo and Zhenhai, and the residents were awakened from their sleep. However, the people are deeply convinced that the coastal defenses are solid, and that the Japanese army will never succeed. Therefore, the order is very good, and the people are calm. Now, although there are still Japanese warships coming and going from time to time outside the port of Zhenhai, they do not dare to stay for long. In the past two days, only one ship has been anchored near Longshan, and there have been no other movements.

The Situation in Ningbo

Everything is normal. After the usual closure of shops during the Lunar New Year, they have now fully reopened. Most of the goods in the shops have been ordered to be dispersed. However, the agencies and banks are preparing to move elsewhere, because with the war approaching, they must prepare everything to prevent emergencies. The local area is extremely peaceful. This can be comforting news for the people of Zhejiang who are living in Shanghai. However, after Fenghua Xikou Town was again ravaged by Japanese aircraft, apart from slight damage to the bus station and the bombing of more than ten farmers, women, and children to death, there were no other losses.

### Public Works Department Music Corps: Excellent Achievements Last Year; Public's Love for Music Increases

Last year, although the political and social situation in this city remained precarious and unstable, the Public Works Department Music Corps can be said to have had one of its most successful years in terms of both performances and ticket revenue. The average audience for the winter symphony concerts reached 670 people per performance, compared to 565 the previous year. The total revenue for the year, including the summer open-air concerts, amounted to 34,000 yuan, an increase of 10,000 yuan compared to the previous year. Since the start of the symphony concert season in October last year, several performances have been sold out, with many listeners unable to obtain tickets.

The Music Affairs Subcommittee has made exceptional efforts for the corps, which is greatly appreciated. The French authorities and the Italian government in this city continued to provide financial support to maintain the corps last year, with the French authorities donating 20,000 yuan and the Italian government donating 30,000 lire. In addition, French officials and the Italian Ambassador to China, Mr. Mancia, generously donated scores by musicians from their respective countries, enabling the corps to arrange programs dedicated to French and Italian music. Last year, more than twenty French scores were donated to the corps' library, and no less than thirty Italian scores were donated. The corps received scores borrowed from Rome free of charge through the Italian Ambassador, which led to the great success of the "Resurrection of Jesus" program by Mr. Bin Panluoxue in April last year. Furthermore, thanks to the efforts of Mr. McDonald, Chairman of the Music Committee, several scores were borrowed from England to cater to the preferences of those who love British music.

Last year, the corps hired five Chinese musicians to strengthen its internal structure. Their salaries were paid from the funds donated by the Italian government.

The work of the corps from January 1st to May 31st of the seventh year was as follows:

(A) Holding weekly symphony concerts at the Lyceum Theatre (continuing the winter symphony concert season from the previous year), including: (1) two regular programs (with ticket prices divided into four categories: 2 yuan, 1.5 yuan, 1 yuan, and 6 jiao). The average audience per performance was 650 people. (2) two special programs held during Easter in April (with ticket prices divided into five categories: 3.7 yuan, 3.15 yuan, 2.65 yuan, 2.1 yuan, and 1.65 yuan). The total audience was 1,300 people, with revenue estimated at approximately 2,800 yuan.

(B) The corps provided services at the request of private individuals on three occasions, all with artistic significance: (1) On November 11th, at the request of Mr. Si Qu Luoke, participating in the concert of Mr. Keruoshanshi. (2) On February 22nd, 23rd, 24th, and 25th, at the invitation of Mr. Luoka, participating in the performance of Mr. Ka's play "Willow". (3) On March 21st, at the invitation of Professor Chai Kehaluofu, participating in the concert of Mr. Ha Fukeji, a student of Mr. Chai.

Summer Open-Air Concerts (June 15th to September 2nd)

(A) Holding string concerts every Tuesday and Saturday from 9:00 PM to 11:00 PM in the Zhaofeng Park, and every Thursday in the French Park. Tickets were divided into three categories: 1 yuan, 5 jiao, and 2 jiao. A total of twelve regular string concerts and four special programs were held in Zhaofeng Park. Three regular string concerts and four special programs were held in the French Park. Tickets for special programs were sold for 2 yuan, 1.5 yuan, 1 yuan, 5 jiao, and 1.1 jiao.

(B) Holding brass band concerts every Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday afternoon in the Gujiazhai Park, the Bund Park, and the Zhaofeng Park, respectively (except for those who occupied seats, who were charged 2 jiao, otherwise free of charge). A total of thirteen performances were held in Zhaofeng Park, twelve performances were held in Gujiazhai Park, and special programs were held on July 4th at the American Country Club and on July 14th for the military parade ceremony in Gujiazhai Park and the banquet at the French Embassy.

From September 3rd, the musicians of the music corps were granted a three-week vacation.

The 21st Winter Symphony Concert Season (October 1939 to May 1940) began on October 1st last year. Until the end of the year, weekly symphony concerts were held at the Lyceum Theatre every Sunday afternoon from 5:15 PM to 7:15 PM, totaling twelve performances. Ticket prices were appropriately increased, divided into four categories: 2.6 yuan, 2 yuan, 1.5 yuan, and 1 yuan. The average audience per performance was 680 people.

From January 1st to April 30th, and from November 1st to December 31st, a total of twelve concerts were held in schools.

Voluntary Service: Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, 32 members of the brass band joined the special patrol team of the Police Department and organized a music team under the command of Mr. Rui Yu, the director of the brass band, for voluntary service. The team's performance at the Police Department's drill on January 15th last year was excellent.

Overview: Based on the above, it can be seen that the average audience for the 34 concerts held during the eight months of the symphony concert season last year was 670 people per performance, which is much higher than the average of 565 people per performance in the previous year. Among the 34 performances, 13 were sold out, and the remaining 21 performances were also crowded.

As for the summer open-air concerts, although some performances were canceled due to bad weather, the results can be described as satisfactory. The string concerts held in Zhaofeng Park and the French Park were attended by 10,200 people, with a total revenue of 8,900 yuan. The four special programs staged in the French Park (previously, the audience never exceeded 350 people) saw an increase in ticket prices, with an audience of 2,500 people. In addition, the four special programs staged in Zhaofeng Park were attended by 3,200 people.

The 34 brass band concerts held in various parks were also crowded and well-received.

Finally, the director of the music corps expresses his deep gratitude to the artists and soloists who collaborated with the corps last year, taking on the enthusiastic roles of temporary conductors, composers, and soloists!

### Taiyuan Petroleum Company: Manager Embezzles Large Sums; Audit is Time-Consuming; Detention for Two Weeks for Further Interrogation

The Taiyuan Petroleum Company in Hai'an Town, Jiangbei, was jointly established by Jiangbei natives Zai Jingzhi, Wang Yifu, and Zhu Xiaofeng, with Zhu serving as the manager. Zhu and Zai Jingzhi were originally father-in-law and son-in-law, so Zhu was highly trusted. Recently, Zai Jingzhi suddenly learned that Zhu was planning to embezzle the company's funds and use them for his own business operations.

After Investigation Proved True, a report was filed with the Zhabei Police Station, ordering Chinese detective Wang Yingjie to go to No. 48 Jinlong Street to arrest Zhu and the accountant Shi Boyin, who were then escorted to the Special First Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide continued the trial of this case in the first criminal court. Zai Jingzhi and others hired lawyers Wang Yaotang and Tao Wuzhi to appear in court, while Zhu also hired lawyer Liu Gui for defense. The police lawyer Ru Baoyi stated that,

During the Previous Trial, it was thought that the amount embezzled by the defendant was only 40,000 to 50,000 yuan. However, after the adjournment, the accountant Pan Xulun audited the accounts and found that the actual amount was between 100,000 and 200,000 yuan. Since there are one to two hundred account books, a longer period of time is required for detailed investigation. Therefore, it is requested that the postponement be extended for another two weeks. When the defendant was arrested, he had a personal diary,

Intending to Abandon it, but it was seized by the detectives. The diary contained many entries related to the accounts. When the detectives questioned Zhu, he refused to answer. Furthermore, it was noted that hundreds of bags of rice were stored in a location in Hongkou, but he refused to provide details, making it impossible to investigate. It is requested that he be interrogated further, etc. Zhu stated that the accounts recorded in the diary were temporary records made when he went out to handle goods, which were then entered into the company's accounts upon his return. As for the written

Rice Arrangement, it was because my cousin Zhao transported rice to Shanghai, which was detained by the Japanese, and he asked me to investigate. After Judge Feng's review, he ordered that Zhu Xiaofeng and Shi Boyin be detained for another two weeks for interrogation.

### Boat Capsizes in Wind; Drifting and Rescued

According to the English-language Da Mei Evening News, four Chinese people were traveling by boat from Weihaiwei to Tianjin when they encountered strong winds and were blown hundreds of miles off course, drifting south. They encountered another storm, and the boat capsized. The four managed to climb onto a raft, thus avoiding being buried in the belly of the fish. After a total of twenty-two days, they were spotted and rescued by the German ship "Heini" near Ningbo last Thursday. They were brought to Shanghai this morning (the 13th) and have been sent to the hospital for treatment.

### Kidnapping Case Occurs in Caoyang Road, Western Shanghai; Victim Named Zhou Xianzhang

At 6:45 AM yesterday morning, another kidnapping case occurred in Lane 1150, Caoyang Road, Western Shanghai. At that time, four or five thugs armed with Mauser pistols lingered in the lane for a long time. When a man in his thirties emerged from the lane, the thugs threatened him into silence, grabbed him, and dragged him towards Northern Caoyangzhai. It has been learned that the man is named Zhou Xianzhang, a native of Hubei, 34 years old. He previously held an important position in the Songhu Garrison Command. Since the August 13th Incident, he has been unemployed at home and his finances are extremely tight. It is difficult to support his family. Yesterday morning, he was suddenly kidnapped, and the reason is unknown.

### Infatuated with a Female Guide; Embezzles Funds; Goes to Offer New Year's Greetings and Apologies; Manager Reports to Police for Arrest

Wu Jingfu, a native of Ningbo, 36 years old, has been working as a runner at the Liyuan Customs Brokerage at No. 19 Avenue Edward VII. He has always been honest and trustworthy, and is deeply trusted by the manager of the brokerage, Pei Chunsun (32 years old, Shanghai native). Unexpectedly, since the winter of last year, Wu suddenly changed and frequented social venues, met a female guide named Meng Lijun, and became deeply infatuated. He rented a house and lived with her, and from then on, he squandered money as if it were dirt. After spending all his savings, he took advantage of his position to privately collect 1,200 yuan in customs duties and 349 yuan and 1 jiao 9 fen in handling fees from customers. He then took the female guide to the Hollywood Casino in Western Shanghai and lost everything. The manager of the brokerage, Pei Chunsun, discovered the matter and investigated. Wu avoided meeting him. At the end of last year, Pei reported the matter to the French Police, who sent detectives to his residence to arrest him. Wu had already heard the news and fled to the Hongkou Special Area with the female guide, residing upstairs in the Dapaotou Automobile Shop on Zhonghong Road. The day before yesterday, Wu took advantage of the Lunar New Year to go to the Liyuan Customs Brokerage alone to offer New Year's greetings and apologies to the manager, Pei Chunsun, hoping to resolve the matter. Pei pretended to be perfunctory and sent someone to report to the police station. Detectives arrested Wu, and yesterday afternoon he was escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Special Court. Police lawyer Fei Xizhen presented the case and requested a postponement for further investigation before bringing the case to trial. The plaintiff, Pei Chunsun, commissioned lawyer Huang Jiyuan to represent him and filed an attached civil lawsuit, seeking to recover the embezzled 1,549 yuan and 1 jiao 9 fen. When questioned, the defendant Wu Jingfu admitted to using the funds. After the judge reviewed the confession, he ordered a postponement for further investigation and ordered the defendant to be detained.

The Yufeng Laundry and Dyeing Company at No. 514 Fujian Road is owned by Yu Shengguan, a native of Ningbo. Yu's daughter is married to Zhang Shunzhang, a fellow townsman, and the son-in-law and others live in the store. Bao Xilin (20 years old), a native of Shaoxing, was hired as an old clerk and had been serving for more than a year. However, Bao's character was improper, and he was dismissed at the end of the Lunar New Year. He wandered outside for a few days and exhausted his funds. The day before yesterday afternoon, he returned to the store, and Yu did not refuse him, providing him with food and lodging as usual. At 8:00 AM yesterday morning, as Yu and his son-in-law Shunzhang were having breakfast in the store, Bao suddenly had wicked thoughts and sneaked into the room of Yu's daughter, Zhang Yu, upstairs, locking the door with the intention of committing indecent acts. Zhang was awakened from her sleep and cried out for help. After a while, her husband, Zhang Shunzhang, rushed upstairs and broke down the door with an ax. At that moment, Bao turned and fled downstairs, but Zhang picked up a mallet and struck Bao on the head, causing a large wound. Bao bled profusely and collapsed to the ground. He was then taken to Tongren Hospital for treatment by the staff. The hospital reported the matter to the Zhabei Police Station, which sent detectives to investigate and handle the case.

### Lonely Wanderer; Dies by Hitting Wall

A native of Chongming, whose name is unknown, is known by the nickname "Little Chongming." He is about thirty years old. Before the war, he worked in a factory. After the war, he not only lost his job but also his family, leaving him alone and turning him into a beggar. Recently, due to hunger and cold, he was unable to make a living and had suicidal thoughts. At around 8:00 PM the night before last, in front of the Dongxing Teahouse at No. 1188 Xujiahui Road, he violently hit his head against the wall, causing a fracture on the left side of his head, concussion, and bleeding. He fainted and collapsed to the ground, and soon died. The patrolman who saw the incident reported it to the police station, who sent detectives to investigate. The body was taken to the Tongren Auxiliary Yuan Branch for examination, and the court will be requested to send someone for inspection today.

### Gathering to Gamble and Collecting Commission; Head is Sentenced to Imprisonment; Gamblers Fined

The French Police Department, believing that every Lunar New Year, unscrupulous individuals would gather in hotels or residential homes to gamble and collect commissions for profit, violating the ban and causing public distress and financial loss, instructed the detectives of the Gambling Squad to conduct strict investigations. The night before last, the Chinese and Western detectives of the Gambling Squad discovered two locations where Pai Gow gambling was taking place, with large amounts of money being wagered: the reception room at No. 8 Taixin Lane, Xinkaihe, and the front room on the second floor of No. 614 Kangti Road. They immediately rushed to the addresses, arrested the heads Li Zhenglong and a woman, Ping Lin, as well as Zhang Dalin, Xu Guilin, and twenty-one male and female gamblers. Gambling paraphernalia, dice, shaking cups, and over a hundred yuan in gambling money were seized and taken to the police station. Yesterday afternoon, they were escorted to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Special Second Court, where police lawyer Yao Zhaodi filed a public prosecution against them for the crime of gathering to gamble. After questioning by Judge Qiu Huanrong, the heads were sentenced to two to three months of imprisonment, and the gamblers were fined. The gambling paraphernalia was confiscated.

### Chinese Institute of Architects Holds Annual Meeting; New Officers Elected

Members attending the meeting included Zhuang Jun, Li Jinpei, Yang Xiliu, Luo Bangjie, Dong Dayou, Wang Huabin, Pu Hai, Zhang Xingchun, Ma Junde, Liu Hongdian, Zhong Mingyu, Huang Yuanji, Wu Baihua, Lu Shusen, Li Yingnian, Zhou Yunfa, Chen Yexun, Fan Wenzhao, Xu Chongji, Wu Ziang, Chen Zhi, and more than twenty others.

Then, the election of new officers was held, and the results were as follows: President Zhuang Jun, Vice President Dong Dayou, Treasurer Wu Ziang, Secretary Huang Yuanji, Directors Li Jinpei, Chen Zhi, Fan Wenzhao, Luo Bangjie, and Yang Xiliu. Finally, the entire group took a group photo and had dinner before adjourning. It was already ten o'clock. It was also heard that the Department of Architecture, jointly run by the institute and Shanghai University, had professors who were mostly appointed by the institute from among its members, who were renowned architects. Both theoretical and practical experience were emphasized in the curriculum. Therefore, many graduates from previous years have been employed in various architectural organizations. There are still vacancies in each grade this semester. Those who have some knowledge of architecture and wish to study at the school can register with Shanghai University.

### Rigid Tokens; Value Coupons are Easily Damaged; Public Has Suffered Not Small Losses

Since the shortage of small change in Shanghai, various industries once issued value coupons as a substitute. The tram companies and public motor vehicle companies in the two concessions also issued token coupons one after another due to business needs, so that passengers could pay fares. After the Central Bank successively issued fractional currency notes, the difficulty in getting small change gradually eased, so the value coupons of various industries were gradually withdrawn. However, the token coupons of the trolley company and the public motor vehicle company are still in use as before. Now, some people believe that the paper tokens currently used by trams and public motor vehicles are extremely easy to tear. Although the company authorities stipulate that they can be recovered, many are often discarded at will after they are torn, resulting in a great loss to the public. It is specifically suggested that the company authorities change to issuing rigid tokens, such as the round aluminum coins of public motor vehicles, which are an example. It is both convenient for passengers to carry and can reduce accidental losses. After the company issues rigid tokens, it can also avoid the current trouble of collecting old and exchanging for new, and the convenience of ticket sellers in their work is also much greater than checking torn value coupons.

### Pseudo-Municipal Government; Scavenging Excrement; Widely Establishing Public Toilets for Profit

Due to the manipulation of unscrupulous merchants, prices in Shanghai have risen wildly and endlessly. Even fecal fertilizer has become increasingly expensive. Therefore, farmers in the four suburbs of Shanghai regard human waste as the most precious treasure. Because the Shanghai suburban areas controlled by the pseudo-"Police Department" produce excrement every day, and it is manipulated by the excrement contractors, only a fixed package fee is allowed to be collected each month, which cannot be coveted. Therefore, it was decided to set up 61 public latrines in Nanshi, Pu, Huxi, Zhabei, and other places to collect excrement. The estimated construction cost is more than 20,000 yuan, but because the funds are not easy to raise, it cannot be carried out for a while.

### Female Side Repeatedly Obstructs Marriage; Fiance Seeks to Dissolve Engagement; Mediation Fails

Li Shoujun, a local youth, 30 years old, residing at No. 585 Route Lafayette, is still studying. Recently, he hired lawyer Ni Gang to file a petition with the Civil Mediation Office of the Special Second Court, requesting to dissolve his engagement with his fiancee, Qian Kaoyi (local, 28 years old, residing at No. 18 Continental Terrace, Rue Lubin). The petition stated that the petitioner was engaged to the opposing party on June 15th of last year, introduced by the opposing party's brother-in-law, Wu Jian'ge, and Shen Jinsheng. The wedding was scheduled for October 23rd, but the opposing party deliberately obstructed the marriage, putting forward four conditions: (1) 1,000 yuan in bride price must be given to the female side; (2) Yu Zhu and other gold jewellery must be given to the female side; (3) A mansion must be purchased; (4) The entire house must be furnished with rosewood furniture. The petitioner was unable to meet the conditions proposed by the opposing party, so he asked the intermediaries to explain and reduce them, so that the marriage could be concluded. Unexpectedly, the opposing party completely disregarded the feelings of husband and wife and firmly refused, so the wedding could not be held at that time. The petitioner chose January 19th of this year for the wedding and booked the ballroom of the Dengtuomo Hotel for the wedding. Who knew that the opposing party changed her mind again and sent a letter through a lawyer on the 14th of the same month, stating that the wedding could not be held on that day. Considering that the two parties were engaged but unable to fulfill their marital duties, it was no different from a resentful couple. Therefore, he requests the dissolution of the engagement. The court received the petition, and yesterday morning, Judge Chen opened the Fourth Civil Court and summoned both parties for mediation. As a result, the opposing party did not appear, and the court ruled that the mediation was unsuccessful.

### Coal for Water Boilers to be Directly Supplied; Open-Air Company Agrees to Assist; Coal Industry Association Has Already Negotiated

Yesterday, the Shanghai Hot Water Industry Association continued to send representatives Zhang De, Chen Yishan, Zhang Liansheng, Xu Yanwu, etc., to negotiate with the Open-Air Coal Mine Company, requesting direct supply of coal. Secretary Wang Xianting of the company, representing General Manager Wei, received them and agreed to send a letter to the Coal Industry Association for a satisfactory reply and agreed to find a way to directly supply coal, hoping that the members of the industry would wait patiently for a solution and strictly maintain order. According to news from the Coal Industry Association yesterday, the association has already reached an agreement on the supply of coal for the hot water industry, and the application form will be sent to each hot water store immediately, temporarily supplying one ton to each store. The selling price is set at 98 yuan per ton. However, hot water stores have closed one after another, which has caused great inconvenience to all walks of life. It is reported that the Shanghai Refugee Children's Education Center on Wuding Road, which houses hundreds of refugee children, can no longer obtain hot water to drink. It is also reported that many hot water businesses (13th) yesterday followed one after another and ceased business. Civilians in the concession are quite panic because they have nowhere to buy hot water.

### Low Pressure Attacks Shanghai; Fierce Winds Howl in the City; Low Pressure Has Moved Towards the East China Sea Yesterday Morning; Fog Disperses and Land and Water Transportation Resumes

According to the Datong News Agency's reporter who learned from the Xujiahui Astronomical Observatory, the fog that has occurred in this city for several days is affected by the low pressure that occurred in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and attacked Shanghai. However, the low pressure passed through Shanghai yesterday morning and moved towards the East China Sea. The misty fog will naturally dissipate. When the low pressure passed through Shanghai in the early hours of yesterday morning, the weather in the city changed drastically. Fierce winds howled, with a force of three to four. After 8:00 AM, the wind gradually subsided, but the sky was still extremely gloomy, and the temperature dropped. The temperature between 5:00 AM and 6:00 AM dropped sharply to about 40 degrees Fahrenheit.

### Gathering to Gamble with Dice; Wang Chunhua's Head is Cut

Wang Chunhua, a native of Jiangbei, was gambling with dice with his fellow townsmen Zhang Yequan and Hang Shifu in the fourth lane of the Shimin Village on Hongqiao Road at 10:00 AM on the 12th. A dispute arose over the size of the numbers. Hang actually helped Zhang Yequan to cut Wang Chunhua's head with an ax. Neighbors called the police and arrested Zhang and Hang. They were escorted to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Court yesterday, requesting a postponement. Judge Qiu ascended to the seat and briefly interrogated them before ordering the defendants to be remanded in custody, pending verification of the victim's injuries before further interrogation.

### Weather Report

The Xujiahui weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday stated that the area around Shandong is cloudy and cold, with strong northwesterly to northeasterly winds. This area and the coastal area south of Ma'an Island are cloudy and even colder, with local rainfall and strong seasonal winds. Also, in the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in this city was 42.8, and the lowest was 39.2. On the same day last year, the highest was 44.6, and the lowest was 37.8.

### Grains: Speculation in Foreign Rice Intensifies; Saigon Rice Approaches Fifty Yuan

More than 20,000 Bags Traded, Actual Sales Less Than Half; Thick and Thin "Jing" Rice Have No Official Market, Traded in Private at Over Fifty Yuan; "Xi" Rice Still Opens at Forty Yuan, Secretly Traded at Over Fifty Yuan; Where Will the Food Supply of Shanghai End Up?

The Xiaoguanghan Rice Market on Fuzhou Road, since its grand closure and week-long shutdown last winter, its spring opening yesterday already saw prices for various kinds of rice showing a forceful, surging trend like the Zhejiang tide. Compared to the closing prices of last year, they had risen by more than 15%, exceeding expectations, proving the power of manipulation. As for the various sources in the interior, after the closing period last year, those transported via both water and land routes through the Hongkou district included more than 2,000 bags of Wuxi white "Jing" rice, 14-15 cartloads of Kunshan white "Jing" rice, and 15 boats of "Qingsi" thin "Dao" rice and "Nangang" early and late "Dao" rice from "Hexia" shipments, totaling approximately 5,000-6,000 bags. This spring, only four carts of Kunshan white "Jing" rice and three or four carts of Danyang white "Yuan" rice, etc., have arrived, further fueling the arrogance of the manipulators. Therefore, at the initial opening yesterday morning, the sellers' cries soared. According to rice industry regulations, if trading occurs in the market, it must be conducted according to the rules, which is perfectly reasonable. However, the failure to effectively ban private trading allows each business to only display a few samples, and the trading on the market becomes dominated by various kinds of unrestricted foreign rice. Domestic rice, apart from some white "Yuan" rice, has completely disappeared. Those exchanging goods are exclusively dealing with foreign rice. After shops closed, they hastily replenished their stocks, disregarding the high prices, and collectively sought to purchase goods. For a time, people inquired and asked each other, competing to buy without weakening. However, under the powerful hands of transient merchants, they are allowed to hoard and manipulate prices, making it impossible to resist. Price limits have long been abandoned, and the market is soaring like a "Peng" bird flying ten thousand miles. "Yuan" rice is unrestricted, so the opening price for Danyang white "Yuan" rice, which is originally not comparable to "Jing" rice, has risen sharply, opening at 41 yuan. Saigon No. 1 is sold at 48 yuan. The price of "Jing" and "Xian" rice has long passed the 50 yuan mark. The only concern is that they can only trade privately. Thick and thin "Dao" rice have no official market, but it is heard that Kunshan white "Jing" rice is being traded outside the market at 48.5 to 53 yuan, thin "Dao" rice is also being sold at 50 to 47-48 yuan, and early and late "Dao" rice at 46.5 yuan. The surge in the opening prices was already widely rumored in the market last year as a planned action, evident in the large quantities of foreign rice arriving during the holidays, while rice prices soared, far exceeding the laws of market supply and demand. What is this if not manipulation?

Large quantities of foreign rice continue to arrive. The Taikoo Company's Shandong ship arrived on the eleventh (the day before yesterday) with 12,739 bags. On Monday evening, Jardine Matheson's "Yusheng" ship arrived from Haiphong with 13,000 bags. It is heard that today, the French postal ship "D'Artagnan" is directly transporting 39,100 bags from Saigon. The Italian ship "Himalaya" is expected to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow, also carrying a large quantity of Saigon rice. The exact number is pending a detailed report. (Zu)

Speculative merchants treat foreign rice as a "rubber ball," so it has become the only openly speculated commodity in the rice market. Therefore, although the opening volume of spot goods yesterday was a significant 20,000 bags, actual sales were less than half of that number. This shows that all of it was absorbed by hoarders both inside and outside the industry. Rice merchants still feel self-justified, believing that if they didn't manipulate and raise prices like this, who would want to do the rice business? They claim that such price hikes are an act of great benevolence by rice merchants to maintain the food supply for the people. They wonder, if there were no such manipulation and hoarding, would Shanghai's food supply truly face a shortage of rice? This kind of extremely unrestrained trickery is not limited to the rice industry. This year, various industries, such as coarse grains, oil cakes, coal, cotton yarn, cotton cloth, and all daily necessities, are undeniably driven by the same motives. Therefore, in recent years, the prices of these commodities have been leaping and soaring endlessly. Yesterday morning, Saigon rice opened at only 46.5 and 47 yuan, but then soared to 49 yuan. In the afternoon, hoarders became even greedier, with private trading of high-quality goods reaching as high as 49.57 yuan. No. 2 Saigon rice also reached 46-47 yuan, small pieces of rice 47 yuan, and even mixed foreign rice and broken rice opened at 40 yuan. The ordinary people of Shanghai will also find it difficult to afford even broken rice. While relying on "Pihshugen" (a type of edible root) as a substitute for food may not become widespread in Shanghai, it is unavoidable to some extent. As for "faces with a starving pallor, corpses littering the fields," this will become an inevitable phenomenon in Shanghai's future.

Foreign rice: New transactions show considerable volume. In addition to the 2,000 to 3,000 tons traded the day before yesterday, another 6,000 to 7,000 tons were finalized yesterday, with prices rising steadily. Siamese No. 2 and Saigon No. 2 both increased from 55 to 55.23 yuan. No. 2 Saigon reached a high of 55.5 yuan. Small pieces for March were 55.3 yuan. No. 1 and No. 2 broken rice were priced at 26.35 yuan per hundred catties. Futures rice rose sharply by two yuan compared to the day before yesterday, and compared to last winter, both current and futures rice have risen by 4-5 yuan.

### Flour Prices Secretly Raised: Wheat Reaches Twenty-Two Yuan

The flour market's No. 2 factory flour at ten yuan has long been unavailable for purchase; it is a complete deception. Therefore, all transactions are for recycled goods. It is heard that "Lv Zhuoche Zhan Dan" (a type of flour coupon) are selling at a high price of fourteen yuan, and are still in short supply. Even the "Bingham Steamer brand" flour in warehouses outside the concession requires a price of 13.5 yuan. Its rising momentum can be considered fierce.

Before the spring holiday, the price of wheat had reached the twenty yuan mark. The day before yesterday, the opening price was temporarily disrupted. Yesterday, the market had already opened for sale two carts of Su-Chang wheat, priced at twenty-two yuan, two yuan higher than last year. However, factories are demanding high prices, resulting in a temporary lack of trading.

### Oil Market: Soybean Oil Rises Sixteen Yuan; Raw Oil and Soybeans Rise Accordingly

The soybean oil market, continuing the momentum from the previous day (a total increase of nine yuan in the open and private markets on the second), was further influenced by the exchange rate, resulting in a buoyant atmosphere and a frenzied attitude in the market, making it difficult to describe. Goods holders seized the opportunity to push prices up, and speculators fueled the flames. The price difference in one day was eight to nine yuan, a jump of sixteen yuan in the open market compared to the previous day (for Dalian crude oil). The prices of other various oils and oil powder all rose by six to seven yuan or more. The count included 200 pieces of Jiaozhou oil, detailed in the market price column; 100 pieces of Yanqi oil; 100 pieces of Qingqi oil; 600 barrels of Dalian crude oil; 20 barrels of Jiangbei oil; 10 barrels of Changzhou oil; 200 loads of local factory oil. Peanut oil followed in the footsteps of soybean oil, consistently rising by four yuan. Transactions included 150 pieces of Jiaozhou oil and 200 pieces of "Luhuo" (delivery in three to four weeks); 40 barrels of Qingdao oil; 300 cans of Jiangbei oil; and 500 cans of Yantai oil.

Soybeans, driven by strong support from all sides, caused hoarding to become active, and the market continued to see jumps in prices. It rose another one to two yuan from the previous day's market. Transactions included one cart of Bengbu soybeans at a price of 25 yuan; 100 bags of Taicang soybeans at a price of 25.5 yuan; 300 bags of Wuhu soybeans at a price of 23.5 yuan; 200 bags of large-grain Qingdao soybeans at prices of 27 and 28 yuan; 140 bags of Jiangbei soybeans at a price of 22.8 yuan; more than 1,000 bags of Dingjiazhou soybeans at prices of 25.5 to 24 yuan and [illegible] angle; and more than 1,000 bags of Chongming "Shagong" [illegible] from 25 yuan to 24.8 yuan.

For export, 335 bags of soybeans were shipped to Xiamen today (the 14th), and another 535 bags, along with 775 bags of shelled peanuts, were shipped to Hong Kong. In addition, 1,000 pieces of soybean cake were shipped to [illegible] gate. (The 13th) 516 pieces of crude oil were transported from Sichuan [illegible] to Ningbo.

### Sugar Market: Foreign Sugar Prices Rise

In the sugar market over the past two days, due to the continued depreciation of foreign exchange, both coarse and refined white sugar have risen consistently. The association's allocated price for spot 24 coarse white sugar has risen by approximately two yuan. Local warehouse goods are priced at 61.3 yuan, newly arrived foreign warehouse goods are 61.3 yuan, old goods are 61 yuan, and transit goods are 48 yuan, up 0.5 yuan. Taikoo refined white sugar has risen by 2.5 to 3 yuan: B-mark western warehouse goods are 61.5 yuan, CW-mark [illegible] 11 yuan, CX-mark 60.5 yuan, DY-mark the same price, HX-mark 60 yuan, eastern warehouse goods reduced by 0.2-0.3 yuan, H-mark coarse red western warehouse goods 43.5 yuan, eastern warehouse 43 yuan, up 1.5 yuan.

### Finance: Exchange Rate Slightly Stable; Range of Fluctuation Gradually Narrows

The foreign exchange market yesterday saw HSBC quote and reveal its rates. British currency stabilized at approximately 4.0625, British silver at 4s2.25d, American changed to 7 yuan. Other exchange rates also uniformly declined slightly. The private market for British and American exchange rates showed a slightly stabilizing potential. The result continued to show a slight tightness. The situation on that day opened flat, but subsequently, due to buying from Japanese banks and Chinese merchants, the market suddenly showed contraction. At the tightest, it was quoted at 4s2.28125d and 7.0625 yuan. Then, Sassoon suddenly sold spot goods, and for a time, there was a lack of buyers, which led to a shift toward loose strength. At that time, British gold was quoted at 4s3.28125d, and the American exchange rate reached 7.1875 yuan. However, HSBC suddenly developed a buying interest, and Sassoon soon returned to buy forward contracts, so the situation once again tightened. Fortunately, Hong Kong Telegraph came to supply, and the situation then stabilized. By the close of the morning session, it was 4s2.96875d and 7.125 yuan. The initial opening of the afternoon session saw Chinese banks still buying, but Hong Kong Telegraph continued to sell, resulting in a sluggish trend. By 3:30 p.m., Sassoon suddenly bought spot goods, and Chinese merchants also bought in slightly, leading to a slight softening. However, until the close, foreign banks were still willing to sell, so it ultimately closed at 4s3.125d and 7.125 yuan. The result was tighter by 0.015625 and 0.03125 compared to the previous day. The trend of futures was similar to that of spot goods.

Hong Kong Banks Sell, HSBC Buys

This morning, the real-time London rate for spot goods showed a recent decrease of 0.0625, with the long-term rate remaining stable. London raw gold remained stable. American bank prices and various American foreign exchange rates were closed due to Lincoln's Birthday. British versus American and British versus French were both stable. British versus Shanghai decreased by 0.0625. The opening selling prices of spot goods by the central bank this morning were British gold at 4s3.28125d and American exchange at 7.15625 yuan, showing no change from the previous close. After the opening, Japanese banks first came to buy, and soon after, Chinese merchants also became slightly active, causing the market to suddenly tighten. At 9:20 a.m., British gold at its tightest was quoted at 4s2.28125d, and the softest American exchange rate was also quoted at 7.035 yuan. HSBC's posted rates were announced, with British [illegible] decreasing by 0.0625. The balanced silver tax was announced to have fallen by 0.25. After this, Sassoon suddenly released spot goods, and the buying wind had subsided, so the market image immediately turned loose. By 9:45 a.m., British gold had grown to 4s3.28125d, and the American exchange rate had also hardened to 7.1875 yuan. Later, HSBC suddenly aggressively purchased, stopping the loose trend. Before long, Sassoon conversely returned to buy forward contracts, so the situation again softened. By 10:05 a.m., British gold had again decreased to 4s2.96875d, and the American exchange rate had also retreated to [illegible] yuan. Although Hong Kong Telegraph came to supply, because foreign banks such as HSBC had considerable demand, the potential was difficult to return to looseness. By the close of the morning session, British gold was still 4s2.96875d, and the American exchange rate was still 7.125 yuan, softer by 0.03125 compared to the opening British and American exchange rates.

The Supply and Demand of the Later Market Is Still Balanced

In the later market, Chinese banks and overseas Chinese, etc., bought spot British gold (20,000 pounds) from Hong Kong Telegraph at 4s3.125d. Supply and demand were balanced, with little change. By 3:30 p.m., Sassoon suddenly bought spot goods, and speculators also became slightly active, and the situation slightly softened, retreating to 4s2.28125d and 7.0625 yuan. After the buying wind subsided, and foreign banks were willing to sell, so by the close, it ultimately returned to level, with British gold still at 4s3.125d and the American exchange rate at [illegible] yuan. This month's British remaining was 4s2.96875d, American exchange at 7.09375 yuan, and next month's British gold was 4s2.234375d, American exchange at 6. [illegible] yuan.

### After a Big Rise: The Gold Market Is Not Easily Stabilized; Still Fluctuation of Over One Hundred and [Illegible] Yuan; Peak Price Seen at 4670 Yuan

Yesterday's market conditions for private trading in pure gold bullion, despite the extensive buying by Hong Kong banks, was unfortunate that the Tianjin banks, which had aggressively bought the day before, suddenly changed their style and sold out a lot while high, and many speculators also closed out their positions, so the result was an indistinguishable mix of ups and downs. Throughout the day, initially, due to the continued tightening and softening of foreign exchange, buying sentiment remained strong. Under competitive buying, the price jumped to 4,650 yuan. Although money exchange businesses later sold, causing it to fall back once, it ultimately surged to a peak of 4,670 yuan due to the robust appetite of securities firms, still 150 yuan short of the unprecedented high price of 4,820 yuan on August 11 of the previous year. People's minds in all directions are still unsettled, and it is not easy to stabilize after a big rise. Subsequently, as foreign exchange rebounded, silver shop gangs and securities gangs sold, and general retail investors also thought about exiting to cash in, and the situation turned around, retreating to 4,590 yuan. Soon after, the [illegible] market softened, and securities gangs and gold shops entered the market again, buying again. It was also heard that there was activity among Hong Kong gangs, and the price flew up again, reaching 4,660 yuan. Later, as the exchange market stabilized, buying was less than selling, so the noon close was only 4,585 yuan. The initial opening in the afternoon was still firm, at 4,600 yuan, but due to the strong selling by gold shops, and securities gangs rushing to sell again, it once fell to 4,565 yuan. Unexpectedly, Hong Kong gangs came to search and buy again, and retail investors were more inclined to buy than sell, the rising wind was very fast, and soon it rose to 4,640 yuan. Later, cash gold shops and retail investors competed to sell at high prices, and until the evening close, it was low at 4,605 yuan. Trading was still smooth throughout the day, around 2,000 [illegible] several hundred taels, silver shops screened gold first rose and then returned, and ultimately was level. Customs gold was fixed in a dull state.

Pure Gold Bullion Closes Flat

From the start of the morning session, each bar (ten taels) was raised tens of yuan due to exchange market rate reductions, coupled with mutual bidding and buying by securities gangs and gold shops. A gold shop purchased thirty taels from the silver shop gang for 4,650 yuan. Shortly after, a money exchange firm and retail investors sold, immediately falling back by twenty yuan. Money exchange firms did twenty taels back and forth for 4,630 yuan. Later, the securities gang returned to pull in, and the exchange [illegible] was still softening, and then raised forty yuan. The securities gang purchased ten taels from the money exchange firm for 4,670 yuan. After this, foreign exchange was suddenly reported to be turning loose, and the silver shop gang and a certain silver shop, etc., rushed to sell, and another securities gang also sold, and soon fell back by seventy yuan. A money exchange firm sold ten taels to the securities gang, down to 4,590 yuan. Soon after, with the exchange market suddenly tightening, buying sentiment revived, securities firms, gold shops, and silver shop gangs all came to scoop in, and Hong Kong gangs also entrusted a certain money exchange firm to buy on their behalf, causing the price to rise again to 4,660 yuan. Unexpectedly, a certain atmosphere suddenly emerged in the [illegible] market, and retail investors came to sell again, and the exchange market turned stable, and very few came to buy, so it gradually decreased. By the time of the noon close, it had fallen by seventy-five yuan, and the money exchange firms did thirty taels back and forth for 4,585 yuan as the noon close price. At the initial opening in the afternoon, money exchange firms raised the price and bought, rising high by fifteen yuan. Money exchange firms did twenty taels back and forth for 4,600 yuan. Later, a certain gold shop was the first to sell, and securities gangs and a certain money exchange firm also sold to each other, so it gradually fell by thirty-five yuan. A certain silver shop sold ten taels to the gold shop for 4,565 yuan. Soon after, the exchange market tightened, and Hong Kong gangs suddenly became active, and soon after, a certain silver shop also followed to buy, and for a time, there were very few sellers, and soon it jumped seventy-five yuan. The money exchange firm sold twenty taels to the gold shop for 4,640 yuan. After that, the exchange market returned to level, and cash gold shops and a certain silver shop sold off one after another, immediately falling by thirty-five yuan. Money exchange firms did ten taels back and forth for [illegible] thousand six hundred [illegible] five yuan as the evening close price. The result was no great difference from the previous day, with a fluctuation of 105 yuan throughout the day. The sale price of the cash gold shop's wooden sign was several yuan higher than the pure gold bullion price, and the purchase price was more than ten yuan lower. The current standard gold price was more than fifty yuan lower than the posted gold price, and very little trading was done.

Ornamental Gold First High, Then Returning

The exchange price of silver shop jewelry gold per tael initially remained at 4,465 yuan, but at 10:00 a.m., it was raised by five yuan, and at noon, it fell back by five yuan, and after that, there were no changes. The result was that the exchange price still remained at 465 yuan. The new exchange price was the same as the previous price, and the purchase price was reduced by about fifteen yuan.

### British and American Gold Pounds Have Closed; Gold Certificates Fluctuated Sharply

Yesterday's foreign currencies, British and American gold pounds, had slightly closed, and market prices slightly decreased. British and American gold certificates fluctuated sharply. Initially, following the tight trend from the previous night, British gold certificates rose to 52 yuan, and American gold certificates rose to 14.2 yuan. Subsequently, various parties actively supplied, and market prices gradually loosened. British gold certificates remained firm and did not move at night, and American gold certificates retreated to 13.96 yuan. Hong Kong notes, etc., had weak supply, and market prices continued to be firm. Japanese gold [illegible] had huge amounts coming from the east, and market prices rose sharply, with the evening market at 1.275 yuan. Korean notes also trended firm, with the evening market at 1.04 yuan. Yesterday's market prices saw British and American gold pounds both decreasing by five jiao. British gold certificates rose by 2.5 jiao, and American gold certificates fell by two fen. Hong Kong notes rose by three fen, French franc notes rose by [illegible] li, Singapore notes rose by 1.5 jiao, and Dutch and Canadian notes both rose by one jiao. Annam and Philippine notes each rose by five fen. The prices of other currencies remained unchanged.

### Securities: Speculators Exit, Bond Market Continues to Decline

The private securities market yesterday continued to see bonds failing to rise due to rising gold prices. As speculators continued to exit, the market gradually weakened. At the close, buying appetite slightly increased, and it slightly rebounded. After the red opening, it has fallen for two consecutive days, completely affected by foreign exchange and gold. The environment has not changed much. After the establishment of the Sino-American loan, international sentiment has improved, and there is increasing hope for the future of the war. Southern [illegible] rumors are already well known and are of little significance to the overall situation, so the future of the bond market should still be to buy on small dips. Yesterday's trading in and out saw No. 20, Dafeng, Tiansheng, Defu, and Jiufu all selling, and Jiufeng, Yiyuan, Taifeng, and Lianyi all buying. The result was a small decrease of 0.4-0.5 jiao. Category A bonds, because those who usually trade long are uniquely numerous, therefore also continued a small decrease of 0.75 jiao, which was the largest. The total number of transactions was approximately 450,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.

Stock trading saw thirty shares of Zhejiang Industrial Bank stock traded at a price of 70.05 yuan.

London, 12th electric dispatch: Today's posted market prices for Chinese foreign debt remained stable, and all debts were unchanged.

Yesterday's stock market at the Public Industries Association opened very stably, but subsequently, rumors arose, and market conditions immediately turned weak. In a rush, sellers sold in large quantities, but this wave of selling quickly subsided, as cheap stocks were generally absorbed smoothly. In the afternoon, market conditions turned firm, and transactions were very frequent at prices slightly lower than the highest.

London, 12th electric dispatch: Today's posted market prices for British Far East company stocks all rose. Jardine Matheson Bank stock rose by 2 shillings and 6 pence, to a price of 9 pounds. After deduction of interest, the new price of HSBC Bank stock for shares registered in England was 85.5 pounds, a decrease of 2 pounds from before. For shares registered in Hong Kong, it was 87.5 pounds, a decrease of one and [illegible] pounds from before (unsettled dividends were two [illegible] and a half). [Illegible] Bank stock rose by 12 shillings and 6 pence, to [illegible] pounds, 7 shillings and 6 pence. Kuala Lumpur rubber rose by 7.5 pence, to 21 shillings and 10.5 pence. The rest were reported level.

### Yarn and Cotton: Buying Rises Sharply, Yarn Prices Surge, Double Horse Jumps Sixteen Yuan

The yarn market rose sharply, and the momentum was exceptionally strong. This was due to the high price of gold [illegible] and the tightening of the [illegible] market, which triggered a buying frenzy and active speculators. Therefore, although the actual demand was sluggish and showed no signs of improvement, general selling and buying transactions were extremely prosperous. Transactions this month were particularly high. As for the monthly quotas of operators, they can be manipulated through bills of exchange. Judging from this situation, there are many who recognize the partnership in the future.

The current yarn market opened in the morning because the price of gold had skyrocketed in the afternoon of the previous day, and people's hearts had been lifted. Buyers crowded the market, and those generally holding short positions in February actively covered, causing the table to suddenly tighten and the buying mood to be strong. The opening price jumped by ten yuan. Later, it was heard that foreign exchange had been posted, sometimes shrinking and sometimes expanding, and the market situation was still hovering. By around 11:00 a.m., the buying wind was extremely strong, rising another eight to nine yuan, but after the close, it became slightly peaceful and retreated. As a result, the statistical transactions for half a day totaled 2,075 packages, and the market price for 20-count Double Horse yarn rose by 26 yuan, and the market price for 10-count coarse yarn rose by 15 yuan. The factory Tongyi opened at 32 count, 60 packages of Picking Flowers Butterflies yarn, at a price of 1,090 yuan. Today, forty-four pieces of cotton yarn are being shipped to Xiamen, one hundred and seventy pieces to Hong Kong, twenty pieces to Guangzhou Bay, and twenty pieces to Haikou. The amounts bought by each market are listed on the left.

### Local Cotton Industry Trading Greatly Expands

The trading of local cotton has greatly expanded, but the factory demand remains low. However, trading between industry members is very prosperous, so the market prices continue to rise, also due to the extremely tight foreign exchange and the rising expectations of people. The arrival of goods from the northern Jiangsu source has not been seen, due to the fact that the countryside is still in the midst of New Year entertainment. The current situation of local cotton is listed on the left.

Another dispatch: The market prices for foreign cotton, the New York cotton market, was closed yesterday due to a holiday. However, the Indian [illegible] appeared tired. Yesterday's closing prices fell more than eight rupees from the previous day. Egyptian fell more than thirty pounds [illegible], Liverpool fell more than ten pounds [illegible].

The trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai yesterday was slightly more active due to the relatively active price of yarn. The [illegible] exchange trading in foreign cotton was also somewhat more active. However, due to the shortening of foreign exchange and the high price of the overseas cotton market, the price of Midlin American cotton for spinning 42-count yarn, converted into legal currency, was as high as 267 yuan per dan, an unprecedented high price. Therefore, purchasing foreign cotton at present, because the selling price has already reached its peak, is ultimately extremely dangerous. Therefore, if factories have no actual needs, it is best to temporarily suspend purchasing. The factory delivery price, converted at the American exchange rate of 7.125 yuan, is listed below for yesterday's cotton market.

### Piece Goods: Hoarding Wind Extremely Strong, Fabric Prices Exceed Red Opening

After the opening of local fabrics' red board (opening prices), the market buying atmosphere on both days before and after was strong, affected by the contraction of foreign exchange. White goods, coarse cloth, and coarse twill were up five jiao from the red board, fine cloth and fine twill were up five jiao to one yuan. The increase in prices for dyed and printed calico at the red board opening were already huge. The market was tighter again yesterday, and some continued to rise by five jiao to one yuan. Transient merchant purchase and processing are still scarce, and local traders are purchasing with great appetite. [Illegible] purchased more than 500 bales of coarse cloth from the Jardine Matheson factory, more than 200 bales of fine cloth and fine twill from the Shenxin factory, and more than 500 bales of fine cloth, coarse cloth, and twill from factories such as Xinyu. The local street wholesale houses purchased more than 600 pieces of various red board goods, with Guangdong, Yunnan, Fujian, [illegible], and Tianjin markets making scattered purchases of nearly 300 pieces of various cloths, and the Nanyang market purchasing more than 5,000 bolts of printed cloth and colored cloth.

Spring and Autumn.

### Surplus and Price Increase

— Ruowu

According to reports in various newspapers and information obtained from private sources, all industries ended last year with surpluses. The most shocking news is that a certain yarn factory distributed bonuses equivalent to over one hundred months' salary. This record is probably unprecedented since the opening of Shanghai as a port.

However, there are even greater profits that newspapers have not reported and that private individuals cannot discover. Yet, looking at the lives of ordinary people, almost everyone, every family, is crushed under this huge record and has become the dregs of humanity!

From this, we can infer that the unlimited increase in various prices is actually beyond the "cost of maintenance." Because if it were only the "cost of maintenance," there would never be such huge surpluses (of course, exceptions are exceptions).

Now that we have passed the New Year, and the ordinary people, who are struggling to breathe, are hoping to catch their breath a little this year, two necessities—rice and coal—have risen to even higher new prices. According to yesterday's news: top-quality white rice is forty-seven yuan and a half, and coal briquettes are five yuan and eight jiao per unit.

Naturally, the price increase of rice and coal cannot be equated with other daily necessities. Factors such as insufficient reserves and obstructed supply lines can all cause prices to rise. However, we have also learned our lesson. Last year, when the stock of white rice in Shanghai was plentiful and new rice arrived in abundance, we still suffered a heavy blow. So, perhaps the new records for rice and coal prices are also due to unscrupulous merchants hoarding and manipulating the market?

This chaotic situation not only affects the lives of citizens but is also related to the security of the concessions. The First Special District Citizens' Association has already sent letters to the Public Concession and French Concession authorities, requesting that they conduct a survey of coal reserves, strictly set price limits, and prevent hoarding and manipulation. The concession authorities will naturally do their best, just as they did to limit rice prices. However, this is a remedial measure after the fact. What we hope for is that each industry will have its own standards and, in addition to the "cost of maintenance," also consider the plight of the people crushed underfoot.

### Dead Souls

— Xinliang

(I)

A streamlined, modern car, from some distant place, drove here and stopped.

Two figures wearing thick leather coats, with cigars in their mouths, then stepped out of the car.

"Last night, damn it… I don't know what bad luck I had, I lost six thousand in just one hour…"

"What's that? I lost eight thousand last time, but I finally turned it around. Anyway, there are plenty of opportunities, why be so desperate?…" The other said, seemingly sarcastically and comfortingly, as he stepped into the entrance of a club.

Hey! Inside are nothing but dead souls wanting to get rich. Their faces are covered with bulging veins and flushed complexions, creating an interesting contrast. It's truly an unbearable sight. The clamorous voices, the strange shouts of gambling, and the foul-smelling opium fumes… crammed every corner of the place. They almost seemed to have taken away the souls of these people.

But this tense stimulation is a gamble with wives, children, property, public funds, personality… and their own precious lives!

(II)

"Grand Opera," "Plus Five Living Treasures"… absorbed Xiao Zhang's entire soul. Today is the last day, don't miss the opportunity! Big Head Huang is also very happy. Mr. Li is, of course, a basic member. Good! Then let's go together tonight.

"Qu! Qu! Qu…" the sound of the gong rang, and the curtain on the stage slowly rose. Not only Xiao Zhang, Mr. Huang, and Mr. Li all stretched their necks waiting for the "Living Treasure" to come out, but everyone else around them also opened their mouths, with saliva dripping from the corners of their mouths—as if they were ready to swallow the "Living Treasure" in one bite.

Everyone's blood was surging at an accelerated rate, everyone's eyes were almost about to burst open, and every nerve cell was almost unbearably tense… Sweat trickled down their foreheads, and their hearts were already in their mouths…

The "Living Treasure" finally came out, and when that skeleton-like body appeared before the eyes of these spectators, everyone gasped. From some corner came a "hiss…" sound, and in an instant, the whole place responded.

Xiao Zhang felt a little dizzy. He sighed at these dead souls and hurriedly dragged Old Huang and Mr. Li out…

### After the Rain, a Clear Sky

— Bao Tianyun

Episode 20: World Communication Through a Common Language; Children's Education Through Scholarships and Talent

Jiang Jingrong thought to himself that he must save some money. He had two aspirations: The first aspiration was to allow his little sister to attend elementary school. He felt that his little sister going to elementary school was more joyful than himself going to middle school. The second aspiration was to buy a bicycle. He couldn't afford a new bicycle, so this aspiration was a bit too big. He only wanted to buy a used bicycle. He already knew how to ride a bicycle. He saw many newspaper delivery workers among his colleagues who all had bicycles, which he greatly envied. Because with a bicycle, delivering newspapers would be much faster. For the sake of speed, he could deliver quite a few more newspapers. One of his colleagues had an old bicycle that he would sell to him for only ten yuan, so he had long held this aspiration. Now, before he had saved up the full ten yuan, he had to deliver newspapers on foot. Now, one of the households Jiang Jingrong delivered newspapers to was next door to one of his old classmates, Ye Songfen. Ye Songfen was Jiang Jingrong's best friend in school. He had also been to Ye's house several times, so he recognized it. When the two graduated and left school, they exchanged photos, gave each other souvenirs, and agreed to keep in touch. Ye Songfen's family was very wealthy, so naturally, he went to his middle school. Although Jiang Jingrong had decided not to continue his education, he did not tell his close friend this. He only said: I am also going to middle school, but I have not yet decided on which one. After leaving, Ye Songfen had already sent a letter asking him: Which middle school did you go to? But Jiang Jingrong did not reply to him, ashamed to tell him that he could not afford to go to middle school and had become a newspaper delivery boy. Now, this newspaper delivery household happened to be right next door to Ye Songfen's house. Should he abandon this newspaper delivery household? He thought about it and was reluctant because that family read a lot of newspapers, as many as six or seven large and small newspapers. He thought: He could only deliver it early, before 7:30, before the owners of the house got up, passing by his house without meeting Ye Songfen. Therefore, he always wore an old straw hat low over his eyebrows when delivering to that house. As soon as he delivered the newspaper to that house, he left without stopping. All eight households that ordered newspapers liked the newspapers to be delivered as early as possible. Therefore, that family praised this little newspaper delivery boy, saying that although he was young, he delivered newspapers diligently. Other people delivering newspapers had bicycles but were slower than him. The newspaper delivery person for Ye Songfen's house, for example, didn't deliver until 9 o'clock every day. By 9 o'clock, people who went to school had gone to school, and those who went to the office had gone to the office. Wouldn't that negate the timeliness of the morning newspaper? Therefore, the Ye family was very dissatisfied with that newspaper delivery person. (237)

### Shelter for Beggars

— Fuyun

The beggar shelter on Difeng Road, Yan's Residence (the land belonging to the Public Works Department), was established on February 5th and began accepting people. It has now taken in over a hundred male and female beggars. The shed is triangular, divided into an office, service dormitory, infirmary, and male and female bathrooms. Because the first shelter on North Fujian Road only accepts single men, women in poverty had nowhere to go. Therefore, this shelter decided to accept both men and women, referred by charitable organizations or the police, with some impoverished people also reporting themselves. The shelter immediately accepts those who are truly in poverty. Although it has been open for many days, very few poor people go to the shelter, perhaps because it is located in a remote area and few people know about it. According to the shelter's plan, it can accommodate eight hundred people. The bunks inside the shed are made of bamboo mats, divided into separate male and female sleeping quarters. Upon entering the shelter, residents take a bath in the shelter's bathroom, have their hair shaved, and are issued a set of newly made cotton clothes and pants. Each pair shares a quilt, and all the quilts are newly made. Those with drug addictions are given detoxification medicine by the shelter and given a deadline to quit. Among the current hundred or so people, there are three female beggars who are deeply addicted to heroin. These homeless beggar women have found food, clothing, shelter, and a place to stay, which is truly a blessing for the poor.

### Random Notes on "Gulliver's Travels"

— Xinying

Following "Snow White," "Gulliver's Travels" has been brought to the silver screen by Paramount, filmed as a full-length, five-color cartoon, and will be released simultaneously at the Grand Theater and the Great Shanghai Theater starting on the 15th. Here is a summary of the author of "Gulliver's Travels" and the filming process.

Author's Biography

Jonathan Swift was born in Dublin, Ireland. When he was born, his father had already passed away. Soon after, his mother also died, and he became an unfortunate "orphan" fostered in his uncle's home. Later, he worked as a pastor, but he was not very successful, so he became a pessimist. He was good at writing, and his writing was even more painfully incisive. His works, such as "Tale of a Tub" and "Battle of the Books," were published anonymously. Later, his book "Gulliver's Travels" became famous.

Story Content

"Gulliver's Travels," originally titled "Travels into Several Remote Nations of the World," is divided into four parts: "Lilliput," "Brobdingnag," "Laputa," and "Houyhnhnms." "Lilliput" is the first part of "Gulliver's Travels." This is the author's masterpiece of scolding, offering an unreserved and satirical critique of humanity. The author expressed dissatisfaction with reality. Although the story is based on fantasy, it has a basis in reality. For centuries, it has been considered an immortal masterpiece in literature, and many schools above the secondary level in China have adopted this masterpiece as an English textbook.

Filming Process

Previously, Paramount Pictures achieved great success with "Snow White." Also, given that "Gulliver's Travels" has been translated into various languages around the world and has many readers, not only children but also adults love to read it. Therefore, it was decided to first film one part of the entire book, "Lilliput," into a full-length, five-color cartoon. If possible, other parts, such as "Brobdingnag," may also be made into cartoons in the future. During the production process, the company attached great importance to it. After a long period of planning, it was created collectively by fifteen hundred artists, using five-color stereoscopic filming, with as many as twenty-five thousand large and small characters. It features eight famous songs and is worthy of being a full-length, five-color cartoon art film comparable to "Snow White."

### Casual Talk about "A Flower in a Sinful Sea"

— Muzi

Starting on the 15th of this month, the "China Travel Troupe" will make a small change to its performance schedule. In order to adjust the energy of the actors, two plays will be performed in rotation during the day and evening. The first directory to implement this plan is Xiong Foxi's original work, "A Flower in a Sinful Sea," during the day, and Wei Ruhui's "Ge Nen Niang" will continue to be performed in the evening.

Xiong Foxi's "A Flower in a Sinful Sea" provides a detailed narrative and introduction to the life of Sai Jinhua, from her heyday to her old age, not only leaving a biography for the "Second Master Sai," who was "famous throughout the city," but also reflecting the entire picture of that time.

The one playing Sai Jinhua in "A Flower in a Sinful Sea" is Shen Hao. This name may still sound unfamiliar to the general reader, but those who have seen "Ge Nen Niang" will definitely not reduce their impression of her role as "Shi Niang" because she has few scenes. She graduated from Dajin Women's Normal College and lived in the north for a long time. She is quite amiable and straightforward, speaks Mandarin crisply and sweetly, and has a strong interest in drama and has done some research. Therefore, playing Sai Jinhua in "A Flower in a Sinful Sea" is the most suitable thing for her.

The director of "A Flower in a Sinful Sea" is Li Pingqian. He is known as an authoritative director of love films in the film industry. He put in extra effort in directing "A Flower in a Sinful Sea" this time. Even during the Lunar New Year, he refused to relax for a day and went to the Xuan Palace early in the morning to rehearse. Sincerity overcomes even metal and stone. The director worked so hard, and the other cast members naturally also "worked hard" together. The lively situation in the back of the Xuan Palace these days is really not inferior to the energy in the front.

### Anniversary Celebration Report

— Xiao Cang

The Family Industry Association held a family reunion at the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association on the 12th. The opening ceremony was very solemn. First, male and female colleagues sang in groups, and Ping Opera was performed. The famous amateur Jiang Banqiu sang "Baolian Lantern" and "Song Jiang's Troubles at the Court," with skillful singing, earning a lot of applause. Miss Luo Ruizhi sang the Qingyi aria "Visiting Mother," with clear pronunciation and sweet tone, captivating the guests at the venue. Han Langen performed comedy. As soon as this gentleman appeared on stage, the audience burst into laughter. He sang a humorous hypnotic song and a student forced by the teacher to sing "Sparrow and Little Sea," making every listener laugh uncontrollably. He then performed the Ningbo people, Shandong people, Pudong people, and Jiangbei people playing mahjong together, with people from Su, Chang, Ning, and Shao arguing behind their backs, performing the accents of each region, which was extremely clever, elegant, and not vulgar. This was truly a commendable performance. The strongman Lin Biao performed martial arts, including breaking thick nails with his hands, piercing thick boards with his palms, bending iron plates with his hands, and bending iron bars with his neck, which were amazing performances. It can truly be said that he turned refined steel into something as soft as silk wrapped around his finger, admirable, admirable. The colleagues' drama performance "Napoleon in the Backstage" also achieved satisfactory results. Everyone dispersed joyfully until 11 o'clock.

### Book and Song Talk

— Su Shaoqing

Three Whips and Three Boards (Part 1)

During the banquet, Guan Dayuan said: "The late famous Laosheng Jia Honglin was his uncle-in-law. He often performed with Tan Xinpei, complementing each other perfectly. In 'Searching for Orphans and Saving Orphans,' Boss Tan played Cheng Ying, and Jia Honglin played Gongsun Chujiu. In the court scene, Cheng Ying whipped Chujiu three times. Old Tan had three postures for whipping, and Honglin rose and fell three times while being whipped, which was very beautiful. He was originally kneeling and had to rise with the whip, with his buttocks 'sitting down' and then reversing, which was quite difficult. Someone without martial arts skills would definitely not be able to do it. Honglin originally had no martial arts skills, but when Old Tan whipped him, he could always get up. But when someone else played Cheng Ying and whipped him, he could not get up. According to Honglin, 'Old Tan's whip seemed to have a kind of suction. As soon as he touched (zhān), he would unconsciously rise up. I don't know where his strength came from. When someone else took over, it was the same hand and the same whip. Either he couldn't hit it, or he pressed down too hard, and he couldn't get up when he wanted to.' Some people say that Old Tan knew magic, which may be credible." I said: How could Old Tan have magical skills? It's just that his hand strength was well-trained, and the place and time of the whip strike were very accurate. His energy and spirit were poured into the tip of the whip. The one being whipped was captivated by him, and the two became one. Moreover, Honglin was also a smart person, with sensitive senses, and had rehearsed with Old Tan for a long time. Old Tan was like a magnet with suction, and Honglin was like iron, with magnetism. The two needed each other and could not be separated. Old Tan's whipping and Honglin's being whipped each had their own merits. Whipping must be done right, and being whipped must be done right. That's what it means. When an art reaches its peak, it becomes spiritual. Even if you say Old Tan had magic, it's not impossible. Dayuan also said: "The other day, he sang this play at Gengxin, and Li Hongchun played Gongsun Chujiu. In theory, Hongchun has practiced martial arts since he was a child, so he should be able to rise playfully when being whipped, but the result was not as good as ideal. I think my whipping skills are not as good as Old Tan's, or something is missing."

Movie Story

### Pinocchio

— Translated and Excerpted by Yifan

First Encounter with a Con

As the East gradually brightened with the crowing of the rooster, the sound of the village school bell came from afar. It was dawn.

Old Gepetto woke up and found that his puppet was alive, could speak, and was calling him "Papa"! He quickly gave everyone breakfast and sent Pinocchio to school because good children go to school to study. He instructed him to come back early and not to wander around on the road. But who knew that Pinocchio would go astray as soon as he left the house!

On the way to school, the puppet encountered two con men, two villains who pretended to be honest: Gideon the Cat and John the Fox. Their sharp eyes saw Pinocchio at a glance. Ah! A wooden man who can move without strings! If he is sold to the circus, he will surely be a large sum of money! The two villains discussed their scheme in whispers.

It was easy for these two old swindlers to trick Pinocchio, a newcomer to the world. They asked this puppet if he wanted to become a famous star with them and earn a lot of money. The poor Pinocchio could not resist the temptation of fame and fortune. Without saying a word, he followed the cat and the fox. No matter how hard Jiminy Cricket chased after him, shouting loudly, he ignored you. (3)
