Editorial

### Increasingly Active US Far East Policy

With the increasing tension in Vietnam, the US Far East policy is also becoming more active. In addition to Secretary of State Hull's statement of concern about the current situation in Vietnam, the US government is also considering banning the export of scrap iron, and is proceeding with the fortification of Guam and Midway Island and the strengthening of defensive works in Hawaii. According to US naval sources, Guam will become the Gibraltar of the Pacific, and Secretary of the Navy Knox has stated that he is determined to make Pearl Harbor the strongest fortress in the Pacific. At the same time, President Roosevelt expanded the scope of the embargo on the 13th, banning the sale of aircraft and engine designs and gasoline manufacturing equipment to foreigners. Since the announcement of the termination of the US-Japan Commercial Treaty on July 26 of last year, the various actions of the US in the Far East have been in direct proportion to the deterioration of the overall situation in the Far East. Even though the center of turmoil in the South Pacific has recently shifted from the world-renowned Dutch East Indies to Vietnam, under the cover of the war against China and relations with the Axis powers, the US has not been deceived, but has instead increasingly promoted its active concern.

From the end of the previous European war to the present, the US has consistently maintained its firm tone in the Far East, with the fundamental goal of safeguarding the balance of power in the Pacific and ensuring the integrity of China's territorial sovereignty. The reactions triggered by various international incidents over the past nine years are sufficient to make people deeply aware of the US's position and determination. However, in those years, unfortunately, there was a lack of international and national coordination, and isolationist views acted as a restraint. Furthermore, there was excessive reliance on arms reduction treaties and non-aggression pacts, which resulted in an invisible lag in the international arms race. As a result, the practical performance of the US did not fully match its determination to maintain a just order, which is why the aggressor nations, knowing the US's traditional national policy, dared to act recklessly. Because of this, they even went so far as to misunderstand the US's position, thinking that they could sway it with sweet talk and small favors. They believed that even if this approach did not necessarily ease relations between the two countries, they could simply respond to those written protests and verbal condemnations with accomplished facts. However, in fact, people who are good at tolerance are often the most capable of action. Once tolerance exceeds its limits, it will immediately transform into unparalleled power. This phenomenon is precisely a portrayal of US Far East policy in recent years. Since the hard-line ultimatum in December 1938 did not produce the desired effect, the US immediately changed from being cautious to being resolute. Various powerful and important measures, from embargoes to military expansion, have been successively implemented. The aspirations that were previously only expressed in empty words have now gradually been realized in practical actions, which is enough to uplift the feelings of the world and provide a solid warning against acts of aggression.

However, the use of any powerful and effective measure requires, first and foremost, seizing the most appropriate opportunity. For example, measures such as embargoes and the termination of treaties would not have been implemented until now, and the wildfires in the Far East would probably not have spread so widely. The isolationists who have hindered the implementation of US national policy in the past have made the entire world pay a considerable price. Recently, the power of these people has been reduced, and the narrow-minded opinions of those who seek only self-preservation are rarely seen in newspapers and documents. However, a small number of conservatives still stubbornly defend their positions. Reading President Roosevelt's remarks on the exchange of warships and bases between Britain and the US, he indicated that it was necessary to give these people time to fully digest the situation, which shows that the above-mentioned resistance still exists. On the other hand, some Americans cannot help but overstate the threat from Europe, seeing aid to Britain and the defense of the Atlantic as the most important tasks currently facing the US, and they underestimate the imminent crisis in the Far East. The existence of these two forces is, objectively speaking, almost equivalent to cancer in US Far East policy. At the same time, it also provides the aggressors with opportunities for maneuver. Recently, Secretary of State Hull has repeatedly reiterated the US's determination regarding the Dutch East Indies and Vietnam, but this has not been enough to prevent the continued deterioration of the situation in the South China Sea. A small part of the reason is the excessive internal constraints in the US, and the upcoming presidential election is also seen as a reason for not taking further action. The main reason is that the bitter struggle between Britain and Germany is attracting the attention of the US, and it is expected that before the outcome of the decisive battle between Britain and Germany is clear, the US will hardly take further strong measures in the Far East. The economic and political weapons that the US has used in the Far East in the past have inadvertently increased the inertia of the recipients, making them accustomed to it and unaware of its effects. If they were used in their totality at the appropriate time, the effect would be very different. Of course, those who are perceptive can understand that the US's intention is definitely not to merely stimulate or warn in this way. However, in terms of effectiveness, it is indeed necessary to reconsider the steps and methods of implementing its firm policy.

In this regard, one cannot help but deeply lament that the opportunities for joint action by Britain, the US, France, and the Soviet Union in the Far East in the past were never realized due to various constraints. Now, France is powerless, and Britain is also preoccupied with its own affairs. The remaining two major powers, the US and the Soviet Union, bear a much heavier responsibility for the Far East crisis than in the past. However, the coordination between the two is still lacking in good results. If it were not for China's efforts to firmly support the situation in extreme difficulty, it is not difficult to imagine what the Far East would be like today. In addition to the increasingly active US Far East policy, we would like to express further expectations to the wise US authorities: the war between Britain and Germany cannot be resolved in a day, and its outcome is like waiting for the Yellow River to run clear. The crisis in the South Pacific is imminent and cannot be allowed to develop naturally. Please do not overemphasize the European situation to the extent that you miss the effective opportunity to bring order out of chaos in the Far East. Second, the various measures to stabilize the Far East now exist in isolation. If they are allowed to remain in this state, it will give the aggressors an opportunity to defeat them one by one. The US should take an active responsibility in this regard, forming a Far East anti-aggression front, leaving no gaps for the aggressors to exploit. Third, the use of all economic, political, and even military weapons requires swift action, decisive action, and a comprehensive solution instead of dealing with individual problems in a piecemeal fashion. Fourth, backward conservative ideas and erroneous views should only be overcome, not excessively accommodated. If it is said that in the midst of a general election, one must cater to the ingrained prejudices of the people in order to win, then a figure like Roosevelt would not be so concerned with gains and losses as to disregard the future of the country. We firmly believe that if everything can be used properly, the solution to the Far East problem does not necessarily depend on a naval battle in the Pacific. However, if we continue to procrastinate and delay, allowing the aggressors to gain the upper hand, then there is a greatest possibility of precipitating the outbreak of war.

### To Ensure the Security of the Western Hemisphere, the US Actively Expands Its Military; Government Announces New Naval Policy; Congress Passes Conscription Bill

Honolulu: Secretary of the Navy Colonel Knox warned the US yesterday that "only force can give us security." These words were publicly declared in the Department of Commerce here, because the Secretary of the Navy was inspecting defenses in Hawaii at the time. He said that if we "do not seek security in the entire Western Hemisphere," then there is no security in the world. He said that the naval and air bases in the Western Hemisphere that the US recently obtained from Britain have "significant implications" for European progress. Regarding the status of Hawaii, the Secretary of the Navy said that "these islands are crucial to defending the entire Western Hemisphere." He also said that the consequences of the most degenerative combat power have caused numerous European countries to suffer defeat. The Secretary of the Navy said, "They have gradually weakened, but are we also becoming weaker like them?" Before returning to Washington, Colonel Knox will fly to San Diego to conduct a two-day inspection there. (Associated Press dispatch from the 15th)

(Washington) The US government has recently announced a strong new naval policy, the main purpose of which is to build a two-ocean navy and develop naval aviation. The General Affairs Department of the Department of the Navy recently issued a statement saying that this policy is based on the current situation. The purpose of this policy is to maintain a navy capable of operating in two oceans and to develop naval aviation to become a complete fighting force. In addition, this new policy also includes the following items: (1) the development and maintenance of coastal activities, including the construction of important bases to facilitate the mobilization of troops; (2) measures regarding the location of coastal activities, such as the establishment of geographical areas, and the construction of increased security to prevent attacks; (3) cultivating civilian industries useful in wartime; (4) making the development of naval shipbuilding superiority the main goal, so that the ratio exceeds that of other countries. The statement also reiterated the previous policy of always strategically deploying fleets and emphasized that each fleet must engage in two months of exercises each year. The statement also said that the Asian Fleet and other ships will continue to be prepared to join the main fleet. The policy of developing a major base each on the East Coast, West Coast, and Hawaii will continue, and the air bases on remote islands and coastal areas will also be newly improved.

President Requests Establishment of Budget

400,000 People to Enlist Next Month

Washington: After weeks of debate in Congress, the military service bill has been passed in a compromise form and has now been sent to the White House for approval.

The bill also stipulates that the government has the right to take over factories that manufacture or defend military supplies, if necessary, in accordance with leasing methods. (Reuters dispatch from the 15th)

Washington: Yesterday, the Senate and House of Representatives adopted the historic "Burke-Wadsworth" Enlistment Act, which will allow the US Navy and Army to reach a total of 5 million soldiers. After the two chambers expressed satisfaction with the enlisted bill that had been modified, President Roosevelt immediately asked Congress to authorize the establishment of a budget, with cash funds of US$1,733,000,000 and agreed funds of US$270,000,000 dedicated to implementing the enlistment program. According to the Enlistment Act, there should be 16.65 million men registered, of whom 400,000 will be drafted into the army next month. After receiving this enlistment bill, Congress took 86 days to pass the bill. After the amendments, the bill stipulates that men between the ages of 21 and 35 must register. The Senate passed the bill with a vote of 47 to 25, while the House of Representatives passed it with a vote of 232 to 124. Before the official vote, the two chambers engaged in fierce debate, and at one point wanted to postpone the bill until after the general election in December. The Senate yesterday rejected a provision of the Enlistment Act, which stipulated that the President should be authorized to take over factories that are unwilling to accept fair contracts for national defense production. It is reported that after the Enlistment Act is passed, by October, the United States will have more than 1 million men who have completed training. By January 1 of next year, the United States will have the largest standing army since the World War. According to the Enlistment Act, the Navy Department can also recruit new soldiers into the army, but the naval soldiers who are drafted will serve with the army. The Enlistment Act also allows the government to recruit workers. Observers believe that thousands of men will be mobilized to receive advanced machine training to improve the country's wartime industry for the army and navy.

### Fierce Air Battles Between British and German Aircraft Yesterday in London Skies; British Air Defense Strength Doubled; German Bombs Mostly Fall in Suburbs

(London): London issued its second air raid alarm at 1:06 AM today. A quarter of an hour later, fierce fighting broke out again over central London. Due to heavy cloud cover, the aerial combat was not visible from the ground, but the sound of machine-gun fire lasted for about ten minutes, interspersed with two explosions, indicating that bombs had been dropped due to the attack. (Reuters, 15th)

(London): London issued its seventh air raid alarm at 1:16 AM this morning (9:16 AM Shanghai summer time) within 24 hours. Since yesterday's continuous bombing by German aircraft, the casualties among the people of London have been countless. Before the seventh air raid alarm, the continuous sound of gunfire was clearly audible from the east. Shells, bombs, and flares illuminated the sky. Three hours later, a German bomber struck a public place in the northwest of the city, causing many casualties, including countless children. German aircraft also dropped numerous explosive and incendiary bombs in central and southern England, causing a large number of casualties. (United Press, 15th)

(London): After three hours of eerie silence, London issued another air raid alarm at 1:15 AM this morning. Although the air raid lasted for two hours and seventeen minutes, German aircraft ultimately failed to penetrate the center of London. Londoners witnessed the accurate firing of British anti-aircraft guns, which brought them joy. A reporter from the International News Service heard the sound of distant bomb explosions, but there was no massive shaking like the previous nights, so it is believed that the damage was also slight. According to reports, a squadron of German aircraft, seeing that they could not penetrate the British artillery network, hastily fled. In a certain town in the Midlands, a group of children was holding an aircraft fundraising event when a bomb struck the pavilion, killing many. Today, British air defenses have been doubled to prevent German incursions. At the same time, two million regular troops and guards, together with the navy, are defending all locations. Should the German army attempt to land in Britain, they can immediately confront them. British army and navy personnel pointed out today that the current high tide and full moon are an excellent opportunity for Hitler to invade Britain. (International, 15th)

Fierce Battle the Day Before Yesterday at Dusk

German Aircraft Forced Back by Clouds

(London): The most severe air raid yesterday was at 6:17 PM, when the first batch of German aircraft flew in from the west. A reporter from the United Press, standing on the highest observation deck in London, observed the aircraft shadows very clearly. The German aircraft flew low in a loose formation, but were intercepted by the Royal Air Force. When the British and German aircraft reached the city, the most intense air battle since the start of the European war began. The reporter once silently counted 61 aircraft engaged in fierce combat in the air, all flying high at about 8,000 feet. A German aircraft soon flew rapidly towards the Thames River, presumably to drop a bomb. As the aircraft flew back, a Royal Air Force aircraft went forward to intercept it, and a fierce battle ensued, before both disappeared into the clouds. After a while, eight German bombers suddenly appeared in the clouds, but quickly disappeared. Observers estimated that the number of German aircraft flying to London was the largest this time. However, due to the tight defenses here, many did not have time to drop bombs and escaped. It is estimated that about 300 German bombers and numerous fighters invaded London airspace today, but after the British Air Force rose to respond, they were forced back. The fifth and sixth alarms were the shortest. When the German aircraft attacked for the third time, numerous high-explosive bombs and incendiary bombs were dropped. However, no bombs were dropped during the fourth and fifth times. When the German aircraft flew in for the fifth and sixth times, they were driven back by British coastal air force anti-aircraft guns before reaching their destination. It is estimated that about 200 German aircraft engaged in the most fierce air battle with the Royal Air Force. According to witnesses, this air battle was the largest since the German side began air raids. (Reuters, 15th)

(London): According to an Air Ministry bulletin, as of 7:30 PM yesterday, eleven German aircraft had been shot down over Britain, and the British had lost four fighters, but one pilot landed safely by parachute. On Friday night, a German bomber, while attacking London, was illuminated by searchlights and pursued by British fighters for 20 minutes, before being hit and exploding, falling from the sky. During the second air raid alarm yesterday afternoon, about 300 enemy aircraft flew from the southeast coast, intending to break into London, but were driven back without dropping bombs. According to witnesses, about 200 aircraft were engaged in combat in the clouds during the second air raid in the afternoon. During the third air raid, some bombs fell in the London area, causing some casualties and starting a fire, but it was extinguished within minutes. The fence of a church in the London area was also hit by a bomb, shattering all the nearby glass windows. The 750 people in the church returned home safely. The third alarm started at 2:50 PM and ended after one hour and fifteen minutes. Observers on the rooftops of central London heard the roar of engines directly overhead, as well as the sound of bomb explosions and the simultaneous firing of anti-aircraft guns. During the fourth German air raid on London, bombs were dropped near a bridge. During the sixth German air raid, formations of aircraft flew high over London without dropping bombs, and anti-aircraft guns also opened fire. Aircraft appeared in northeastern, southwestern London and Wales, but did not launch major attacks. (Reuters, 16th)

(London): A church in the southwestern district of London was hit by a bomb yesterday afternoon. The damage in London yesterday was not great, and the casualties were also minimal. During the two air raids yesterday afternoon, about 300 enemy bombers and fighters flew in from the southeast coast, attempting to break into London, but were repelled. German dive bombers injured several people in a certain town in northwestern England. A maternity hospital was hit and damaged, but fortunately, all the pregnant women were sheltered in air-raid shelters and were safe. German aircraft mostly dropped bombs indiscriminately and aimlessly, in order to escape the interception of British fighters. (Reuters, 15th)

(London): The damage from last night's air raids was light, and the casualties were fewer than in the previous night raids last week. Some high-explosive and incendiary bombs fell in the northeastern parts of London, causing considerable damage. According to a bulletin, the German aircraft losses yesterday, in addition to the 11 previously reported, were another seven shot down, for a total of 18. Nine British aircraft were missing, but the pilots of six of them had escaped safely. German bombers launched repeated attacks on London last night, and bombs fell in various areas of England and Wales. A few German aircraft penetrated London, and most of the bombs fell in suburban areas. There was a fire in the city, with slight damage, but the fire was quickly extinguished. There were a total of six alarms in London yesterday. (Reuters, 15th)

German Aircraft Pay Attention to Reconnaissance

Southeast Defenses of Britain

(London): Although six air raid alarms were issued in London yesterday, the intensity of the air raids was not as severe as before, as most German aircraft seemed to be focusing on reconnaissance of the defenses along the southeastern coast of Britain. Only a few bombs fell in London during the day, causing few casualties. According to a joint bulletin from the Air Ministry and the Ministry of Internal Security, the scope of the air raids elsewhere in Britain was smaller, but German aircraft flew around randomly, apparently to intimidate. Several cities on the south coast were bombed during the day. Apart from some casualties and material damage in two cities, there was not much damage. In Ipswich in the afternoon, a church and several houses were destroyed by German aircraft, but there were few casualties. (Reuters, 15th)

### British Aircraft Bomb French Coastal Ports Throughout the Night; Fires Break Out in Boulogne

(London): From dusk on the 13th to 5:00 AM yesterday morning, British bombers bombed the French coast along the English Channel again throughout the night. The intensity and duration of the bombing were unprecedented. As a result, ships in the ports of Boulogne, Dunkirk, Calais, Ostend, and Antwerp were damaged, and the docks caught fire. Although the anti-aircraft fire was intense, British aircraft still bravely withstood the attacks. The entire coastline from Boulogne in the south to Dunkirk in the north appeared to be on fire, and the sound of explosions shook the coast of Kent in Britain throughout the night. Yesterday, British aircraft also bombed ships anchored in a river near Rotterdam, and attacked a convoy of oil tankers near Cherbourg during the day. One ship was hit and exploded. The British lost a total of three aircraft. (Reuters, 15th)

(London): The Air Ministry Information Office issued a bulletin, detailing the damage inflicted on German invasion bases in Britain. It stated that British aircraft activity began shortly after 9:00 PM on the 13th and continued until dawn. The port of Boulogne was attacked first, and British aircraft flew low and launched continuous attacks, bombing the docks and wharves in the port. Several fires broke out, and one explosion caused a red flash. The docks in Ostend were bombed for a full hour. British aircraft dropped large bombs on the ships lined up in the docks, and red and green flashes were seen after the explosions, followed by fires. Ships and wharves were also hit by incendiary bombs dropped by British aircraft, causing the fires on the outer port side to blaze. Dunkirk was attacked shortly after midnight. British aircraft repeatedly dropped bombs, hitting the basin and three sides of the docks. Violent explosions were seen in many places within the target area. Ships in the Carnot Basin and Basin No. 6 in Calais were hit, and dock buildings and railways were also hit and exploded. A large contingent of British aircraft then attacked Antwerp, dropping high-explosive and incendiary bombs, damaging ships in the canal and docks. The docks and wharves were also hit. In the afternoon of the 13th, British bombers attacked ships in the river near Rotterdam with considerable success. Six or seven oil tankers, each weighing about 20 tons, escorted by warships, were seen off Cherbourg, and an attack was launched. One ship was hit, and a fire broke out, with thick smoke rising like clouds. (Reuters, 15th)

German War Report

(Berlin): This afternoon's German war report stated that German aircraft bombed London, central England, and southern England intermittently throughout the day and night yesterday in retaliation. The airfields in Liverpool, Warrington, and other places were bombed by our aircraft. Our aircraft sank a merchant ship (8,000 tons) in the North Atlantic. Several air battles occurred yesterday, and our aircraft were superior in all of them. The enemy lost 30 aircraft yesterday, and our aircraft are missing five. (Haitong Telegraph, 15th)

(Berlin): The German side announced today that it continued to win air battles over Britain. Air Force generals said that London would be forced to surrender in a few days. German officials said that this intensified air raid would "destroy London to the point where it can hardly exist." The German side also claimed that most of London was a smoking ruin and that there was a danger of it spreading throughout the city. German Air Force shot down 21 British aircraft. (International Telegraph, 15th)

(Berlin): On the night of the 13th, a large number of German aircraft again bombed London. The first batch attacked the West India and East India Docks, the second batch attacked Greenwich Station and factories, and the large gas plant on the Thames River bank, and the third batch attacked the Rotherhithe and Canada and Surrey Docks. All pilots unanimously reported that the reorganization of the British anti-aircraft gun teams and the reduction of searchlights made the German aircraft's attacks much easier. (Haitong News Agency, 15th)

### Buckingham Palace Chapel Destroyed

(London): As far as is known, during the fierce air raids on London on Friday, the courts and the South Africa House were hit. The time bomb that landed between the fence of Buckingham Palace and the Victoria Memorial on Friday exploded yesterday, blowing up a large part of the fence. Sandbags were placed around the area where the bomb landed at night, so the explosive force was reduced. The chapel in Buckingham Palace was destroyed by bombs on Friday, and no less than 12 tons of rubble fell, destroying all the altar decorations. Only the piano was unharmed, and the gilded seats where the priest sat and the seats used by the King and Queen were still intact next to the rubble. (Reuters, 15th)

### British Troops Withdraw from Sallum; Italian Troops Enter Egyptian Territory; A Major War May Soon Break Out; Eastern Libya Under Air Attack

(Rome): This afternoon's Italian military report stated that the vanguard of our army has crossed the border into Egypt in Cyrenaica and is currently engaged in fierce fighting with enemy forces. Our army dispatched aircraft to assist in the battle. Last night, our aircraft bombed the Vallerta arsenal and the Karafrana air base with great success. Enemy fleets in the eastern Mediterranean were also bombed by our aircraft. Our aircraft destroyed an enemy cruiser (10,000 tons) in the Indian Ocean. Our aircraft bombed Bomba in North Africa, dropping many incendiary bombs. All losses were minimal. In East Africa, enemy aircraft bombed Asmara and killed one civilian and injured one. (Haitong Telegraph, 15th)

Cairo: With Italian troops entering Egyptian territory, major developments are expected in the near future. Italian troops have recently been harassed by British patrols. Now that they have occupied the deserted town of Sallum, bordering Libya and Egypt, they have entered Egyptian territory for the first time. The gain or loss of this village has no military value in itself, but it is feared that it will lead to a major war. News has reached all sectors that the next few days will be a very dangerous period for Egypt, and the whole country must strengthen its unity to cope with it. Egyptian Prime Minister Hassan Sabry has canceled his trip to the countryside at the end of the week in order to closely monitor the development of events. It is believed that a national committee representing all parties will be formed to consider the situation. (Reuters, 15th)

Cairo: According to a statement, British aircraft continuously attacked eastern Libya yesterday, hitting an Italian seaplane and a pier. A concentration of motorcycle transports near Sidi Barrani was hit and caught fire. The flames could be seen 30 miles away. All British aircraft returned safely to base. On Thursday, South African Air Force bombed various airfields in central Abyssinia. A hangar at the Chimmi airfield was hit directly. Nearby buildings caught fire. Four Caproni aircraft were destroyed and another was severely damaged. One British aircraft did not return to base. (Reuters, 15th)

(London): According to the British communiqué from Cairo today, Italian troops have occupied the deserted town of Sallum on the border between Libya and Egypt. On August 3, the Commander-in-Chief of British Forces in the Middle East announced the start of the withdrawal of British troops from Egyptian territory. Since the withdrawal of troops from the Egyptian border in the first week of Britain's declaration of war on Italy to avoid Egypt being drawn into the war, only one company of British infantry has remained to defend the military camps beyond Sallum against two divisions of Italian troops supported by artillery. Sallum has no military value. The port is small, and no warships have entered it for many years. The population is less than a thousand, there are very few buildings, and there is no supply of drinking water, making it unsuitable as a military base. (Reuters, 15th)

### Labor George's Prediction: An Unprecedented Naval Battle Will Occur in the English Channel; It Concerns England's Freedom and National Prestige; Both Sides Will Try Novel Weapons

(London) Former British Prime Minister Lloyd George recently wrote to the Associated Press, discussing the war situation, hoping that what he said would not be contradicted by reality. He continued, stating that in the English war, we have clearly approached a crisis. The aerial combat in the style of "Mill Race," watched by the world for weeks, has crossed the English Channel to London. We dare to predict that if the war continues and the cruel intentions of the people increase, this aerial war may develop into some situation. The current war seems to be taking place in the narrow sea separating Britain and continental Europe, but it could become the most massive naval battle in history.

The Germans are clearly making maximum preparations to invade Britain and are on the eve of a large-scale naval battle, ready to launch a major war in the sea that forms our country's important defense line. The current situation is no longer just a bluff and intimidation, but a threat that will materialize within a few days. The scope of the war will expand to hundreds of miles, and various forms of war equipment, such as battleships, destroyers, cruisers, motorboats, barges, submarines, and even those that can move from the sea into the sky, such as bombers and fighter planes, and countless previously unused cannons on both sides of the English Channel, will all appear and wreak havoc. British cannons will aim directly at the monsters swimming towards England, while German cannons will destroy the coastal defenses that form a strong barrier to prevent the enemy from landing. This war will be a war unlike any seen in history, and its outcome will not only affect Britain's own freedom but also its future power in Europe. The invincibility of Britain is an important element of this power. It would be foolish to predict the outcome at this time. What I am saying now is that everyone on this side of the Strait (referring to Britain) has a sense of serene confidence.

I have never seen anyone express fear that the Germans can land with the help of cannons and tanks and establish a foothold on this island. This calmness of the British may be due to a long history and the recollection that past invasions of England have all failed. However, this is just a display and not unbreakable. We must know that we are now in an era of science, and when science falls into the hands of evildoers, we cannot know what kind of evil they will create. Ordinary British people will probably not be frightened by the disaster and feel that Hitler has given us a final opportunity to win. If Hitler fails in this great war, he will suffer an extremely unfortunate blow.

In the past, Napoleon also had times when he did not change his adventurous ways, but Napoleon personally went to the front lines to observe the situation before deciding to stop his advance. Churchill believes that Hitler is imitating Napoleon. Hitler has not yet engaged in any attempt that he cannot achieve. This situation may be Hitler's Moscow. However, the outcome is still difficult to predict. We still do not know what new plans Hitler will use to help him cross the sea, or what the so-called "secret weapons" are. All I can say today is that the British people will fight strongly to defend their motherland. (Associated Press, 15th)

### Romanian Government Responds to the Soviet Union, Denying Romanian Military Provocations; In Order to Maintain Friendly Relations with the Soviet Union, Romanian Troops Have Been Strictly Prohibited from Using Weapons

(Moscow) Romanian Minister to the Soviet Union, Gafencu, visited Deputy Commissar for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet People's Committee Nosov on the 13th, and submitted the Romanian government's reply to the Soviet protest of August 29. On August 29, the Soviet Union protested to Romania about the provocative actions of the Romanian military on the Soviet-Romanian border. In the reply, the Romanian government acknowledged that Romanian aircraft flew along the border but did not cross it. The reply also pointed out, "Soviet aircraft have violated the border, therefore the responsibility for this incident cannot be borne by the Romanian Air Force. However, in order to maintain friendly relations with the Soviet Union, the Romanian government has decided to strictly prohibit Romanian aircraft from flying in the connected areas of the Soviet-Romanian border starting from September 1. In the reply, the Romanian government denied that the border incidents were caused by the Romanian border guards and regular army, claiming that the border incidents were caused by the actions of the Soviet border guards. But in order to maintain the most friendly relations with the Soviet Union, the General Staff has strictly prohibited the military from using weapons, unless Romanian territory is invaded." Mr. Nosov accepted the reply and promised to forward the contents to the Soviet government. (TASS News Agency, 15th)

Informal Discussions on the European War (6)

### From Paris to Bordeaux

The following is a report from a reporter for the American "Life" weekly pictorial magazine:

France was not conquered in forty-three days; it collapsed in forty-three days. The French defeated themselves; they themselves understand this point.

What France encountered was the result of ten years of French social and political history. If there were less bewildering news, the world might have been prepared for this shocking event and not be caught completely off guard. Therefore, in this respect, there is somewhat of a sense of internal betrayal.

The French people are generally good people. They may be too cultured, too focused on eating and chatting, and have forgotten how to work. Spending two hours on lunch still happens until the end. As an old lady said, "We are all responsible for this terrible event. France needs a lesson, but this lesson is the most cruel." The most important crime for which the French are now being punished is their long-term tolerance of foolish, corrupt, and hopeless bureaucrats running the government.

France's final collapse began on June 9 when the government withdrew from Sceaux. The speed and scope of the moral, economic, and military disintegration were extremely alarming. For almost two weeks, we did not hear anyone mention the German army. All we could hear were many blaming accusations, explaining who should bear the blame for the failure. The army felt disgusted with the people, the government, and the officials. The people felt the same disgust with the army, the government, and the officials. The government and officials were obviously only concerned with themselves and only thinking about how to escape. Everyone was lazy, disheartened, and furious, anticipating that the situation would become increasingly dangerous.

All reports acknowledge that the French army officers failed their soldiers and their country. We have seen countless officers mixed among the refugees, evacuating their wives and families. We also saw deserters mixed among the refugees along the road from Tours, soldiers with their families, and military vehicles carrying civilians.

Our clearest impression is that there was no fierce battle after the fall of Paris. We actually did not see any wounded soldiers, which clearly shows that the German advance was very fast. Compared to the number of troops participating in the war, the number of casualties was frighteningly small. Bombing is a terrible tactic, but compared to the continuous and intense artillery fire of the last war, it is just child's play. There was no machine-gun fire on the refugee escape routes, only a few bombings of important targets. Apart from some refugees being killed on military roads in northern France, there was no news of the Germans being so horrible.

The myth that the French army fought back to the wall before fighting is just a myth. Most of the French army did fight hard, and thousands of French officers were loyal and reliable. But the claim that the French army is the best in the world has become an illusion. Individual laziness, as is generally said, is not a manifestation of democracy, but a manifestation of laxity and lack of preparation. The army was unprepared, the armaments were unprepared, and the authorities were even more unprepared. Morale on the front lines was indeed high, but once a large army began to collapse, it was irreversible.

The reporter does not believe that the complete annihilation of the 9th Army led by General Corap in the Sedan area was an exception. Five months ago, officers of the 9th Army were already talking about the difficulty of military discipline. After the army collapsed, the officers returned home to evacuate their families, and the soldiers fled on foot. Six hundred soldiers were later found in cafes in Paris. According to unconfirmed reports, one in six of these soldiers was executed by firing squad, and many officers were executed at the same time. According to the latest news, Corap has now returned to Paris to write his memoirs. It is speculated that he and officers like him escaped in transport vehicles.

The disintegration of public morale first appeared in northern France. In some industrial areas in the north, workers woke up one morning and found that the civil administrators, factory managers, and wealthy families had all fled overnight. Among them was a village head who detained a train to transport all the residents of the village to Paris.

The chaotic evacuation of Paris began on June 9. Instructing residents to evacuate only required two procedures: one was radio instructions explaining where to evacuate and how to get there; the other was the police maintaining order on the roads. But neither of these was done. When French radio should have been constantly working to restrain the gullible people from moving, it was broadcasting dance music and repeatedly broadcasting outdated government bulletins. As a result, the morale of the French people was completely demoralized. For several days, half of the French people were fleeing, and half were watching. Those who were watching could not restrain themselves later, and they also packed their bags and embarked on the road to escape, but they were at a loss as to where to escape and why they were escaping. This group of refugees exhausted the food in the countryside, and especially important, created a gasoline panic. Finally, the military and political authorities ordered a ban on refugees from leaving the country, stopping all meaningless transportation, which had hindered military operations in many areas.

The French government suddenly moved to Bordeaux on June 14. A peculiar sight was that fat senators in velvet-lined cars, with charming women, demanded to rush to gas stations to refuel behind miles of refugees.

France was not united before the war, and it is not true that it was united during the war. On the contrary, many smart French people remember that war is a very bad thing, and it is better to maintain a prosperous country and be in a weak position than to be impoverished by France's victory. This is the proposition of those who attended the Munich Conference, and it is this group of people who ruled France until March of this year. Millions of French workers, baptized by Marxism, had no reason to fight in France. The reaction to the peace news was completely heartbreaking and miserable. A soldier generously said, "All the people who lead us are rabbit-hearted."

On June 21, in Bayonne, just one shot would have created a bloody mess. The city was filled with fat refugees from home and abroad, with large cars and beautiful women. The French troops rescued from Cherbourg had just landed, looking haggard and starving. The British Air Force advance team also poured into the city in order to evacuate back to Britain. The Portuguese consulate was surrounded so tightly that soldiers had to be sent to guard the gate with rifles. In a word, the scene was bleak and terrible, something Americans could not imagine.

The following is a letter written by a Frenchman to "Life" pictorial magazine:

I have read your magazine's report on the situation in France and deeply feel that your magazine's correspondent has done what many journalists consider they should do, which is to draw conclusions solely from his own observations, rather than comparing them with the observations of others. The corruption of politicians in France in recent years is absolutely true, and no Frenchman can deny it. I am speaking as someone who grew up in a French family, my family is still in France, and is related to the French government. One thing that must not be forgotten is that when the French are relentlessly criticized by a strongman like Poincaré as aggressors, militarists, cruelists, avengers, and uncooperative people, while weak and incompetent people like Briand and Blum take the stage, the British and Americans praise French liberalism and do their best to flatter.

I received several letters from France a few weeks ago, proving that the French are not a corrupt nation, but a disillusioned nation. They have not forgotten how to work, as your reporter said, and are still working hard. When I wrote to my seventy-year-old mother and asked her to come to the United States, she replied, "Please don't think about it anymore. I have work to do in France, and I still have to stay in France as long as I can fulfill my task of providing relief to the refugees." I also have a sister who used to work in the kitchen of the Paris barracks until 2:00 in the morning every day, and she wrote to me in the same tone. Neither of them has forgotten how to work. They are precisely the representatives of countless French people.

The cars that withdrew from northern France were carrying the bodies of children who had died in the disaster, which is what made the French feel short of breath, but it was not the corruption of the majority of the French people that caused the collapse of France. During this period, the French are sincerely seeking understanding and sympathy from people all over the world.

### September 18th Memorial, Shanghai Jointly on Alert Starting Today; Defense Forces and Business Corps Assist Police in Arrest Work; Hotels and Apartments Are Strictly Searched

The ninth anniversary of the September 18th Incident, the Manchurian Incident, is approaching rapidly. Although the Shanghai Municipal Area will not hold commemorative ceremonies at that time, it will unanimously observe a moment of silence to commemorate the event, focusing on spiritual encouragement to support national policies and complete the mission of national rejuvenation. All sectors will actively promote the collection of winter clothing to provide warmth for soldiers and refugees, and the promotion of national construction savings will also be stepped up.

All Activities Are Prohibited

In order to ensure the security of the Concession, the Public Concession authorities have continued to implement security measures since the "August 13th" Incident. The French Concession also began to block roads on the 3rd of this month and has not relaxed its efforts. Because the measures have been handled appropriately, the situation is good and the order is peaceful. Furthermore, all gatherings, associations, parades, demonstrations, and other activities have been prohibited since the 12th. Now that the anniversary is approaching, it has been decided to implement joint security measures starting today based on the decisions made at the meetings of the two authorities. Therefore, the defense forces of the United States, France, and Italy, as well as the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, will be dispatched to assist in police work.

Decreased Crime, Good Order

Since the Public Concession adopted security measures on the 9th of last month, general security measures have continued to be implemented, and the maintenance of security within the Concession has been very effective. The number of criminal cases that occurred in the Public Concession last week has decreased due to strict security measures, which is very encouraging. However, minor cases of robbery and theft have increased by 56 cases compared to previous weeks, totaling 420 cases. Also, because the security within the Concession is strict, the number of arrested criminals has increased by 92, totaling 527. This is a good harvest since the implementation of security measures.

Roadblocks, Intensified Inspections

As for the road blocking work, the French Concession part has already been completed. Some roads in the Public Concession are still open as usual. The blockage of bridges, if the situation is good, will be implemented at midnight on the 17th, otherwise it will start earlier. However, the dispatch of defense forces and the Volunteer Corps will be implemented immediately. As for the focus of security, attention will be paid to the search of hotels and apartments, emergency searches, and district searches. The authorities will implement double-shift overtime patrols in the "badlands" of Kunming, especially focusing on roads such as Avenue Joffre, Yu Garden Road, Great West Road, Route Tenant de Tourt, Connaught Road, Singapore Road, and Amherst Avenue to prevent the activities of gangsters.

### US Admiral Hepburn to Return to Shanghai This Week

The flagship of the US Asiatic Fleet, the USS Augusta, has been stationed in North China for a long time. Now that the autumn exercises in Qinhuangdao have been completed, all the US warships stationed in China, except for the minesweeper USS Finch, which returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday from Qingdao, will come to Shanghai for a concentration. The USS Augusta will come to Shanghai to dock this week. The US transport ship USS Marblehead, which carried Admiral Hepburn to North China, is now moored in Qinhuangdao, North China. Admiral Hepburn himself will decide to take the private yacht Isable to Shanghai in the short term in order to maintain contact with all parties. According to reporters from the New Voice News Agency, the newly appointed captain of the USS Augusta, Mr. Fairleigh, will be officially sworn in after the ship arrives in Shanghai.

### Bank of China Reduces Remittance Fees for Overseas Chinese

And Waives Telegram Fees

In order to encourage overseas Chinese to remit money to the motherland, the Ministry of Finance has approved the request of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, ordering the Bank of China to reduce remittance fees for overseas Chinese remittances, to sign contracts with local banks in Fujian and Guangdong provinces, and to request the Ministry of Communications to order the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau to reduce various telegram fees. It is said that telegram fees will be waived for remittances of 1,000 national currency or more, and efforts will be made to speed up the process. Now various banks have widely established branches or agencies overseas. Those already established by the Bank of China include branches in Singapore, managers' offices in Batavia, sub-managers' offices in Hanoi, managers' offices in Haiphong, managers' offices in Rangoon, sub-managers' offices on Rangoon Bazaar Street, managers' offices in Surabaya, managers' offices in Penang, managers' offices in Medan, and managers' offices in Kuala Lumpur. Those already established by the Bank of Communications include branches in Haiphong, Saigon, Lang Son, and Manila. The Overseas Chinese Bank has recently established a special Civil Remittance Department to handle overseas remittances. In Thailand, it entrusts the Maribon Civil Remittance Bureau to act as its agent. It is also heard that the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission has advised overseas Chinese that when remitting money back to China in the future, they must declare to the banks, agencies, or civil remittance bureaus operated by Chinese people that they are exchanging for national currency, and must not hand over remittances to the so-called Overseas Remittance Industry Association to avoid being misled into its control scope, the conspiracy to seize overseas remittances.

### Concern from All Sides over the "Empress of Asia" Bombing

Ship Displays Clear Flags

Japan Claims It Resembled a Warship

After the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's regular mail ship, the "Empress of Asia," was bombed by a Japanese aircraft on the 14th, and four Chinese crew members were injured, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and all sectors in Shanghai heard the news with great concern. According to reporters from the Da Guang News Agency who inquired about the shipping industry yesterday, the location where the ship was bombed was near Oshima Island at the entrance to Tokyo Bay, which is located fifty miles southeast of Tokyo. It was found that the ship not only flew the British flag but also had clear emblems painted on it. The reason why it was suddenly bombed by a Japanese aircraft is very confusing. When the bomb exploded, the ship's owner ordered the crew to prepare lifeboats in order to deal with the incident. The situation was tense, and all the passengers on board were greatly frightened. However, the Japanese side tried to cover it up, saying that because the ship had been painted gray since the outbreak of the war, resembling a warship, it was mistakenly bombed.

### Mid-Autumn Festival Today, Do Not Forget to Reward the Troops

Saving Extravagance to Comfort Frontline Soldiers

Commercial and Industrial Groups Observe Customary One-Day Holiday

Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival in the abolished lunar calendar. People from all walks of life inevitably follow established customs, resulting in unnecessary extravagance. However, enthusiastic individuals will save the expenses of this day and donate them to the government to be used as relief funds. Details are listed below:

Rewarding Troops for the Mid-Autumn Festival

Although today is the abolished lunar Mid-Autumn Festival, enthusiastic individuals from all walks of life in the city are mindful that in these extraordinary times, frontline soldiers are fighting bloody battles to resist the war and strive for national liberation. Compatriots in the rear should provide them with material assistance. Therefore, they have decided to donate all unnecessary expenses such as buying mooncakes and burning incense to the National Bank to be used to reward the troops for the Mid-Autumn Festival, fulfilling their civic duty.

All Industries Weathering the Storm

Today is the day for various industries to settle accounts for the Mid-Autumn Festival in the 29th year of the Republic. Factories, shops, and companies are quite busy with account settlement. However, due to traffic congestion, cargo transportation stagnation, sluggish sales, and weak purchasing power in retail markets, various industries are unusually sluggish, not as prosperous as in previous years. Some factories have been forced to suspend work or reduce production due to declining sales. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from financial circles yesterday that various industries in the city, with the help of the authorities, are barely able to weather this Mid-Autumn Festival. If there is no turnaround in the market, it is expected that the final accounting period for the 29th year of the Republic will be even more severe. Yesterday was the weekly holiday, and today is the Mid-Autumn Festival, so all markets and money exchanges are closed for one day.

### Imported Luxury Goods to be Purchased Within a Deadline

For Foreigners to Purchase

Ningbo, Wenzhou, Jinhua, Lishui and other places are full of various imported luxury goods in the market, which should be strictly prohibited to enforce the ban. It is heard that all existing prohibited imported goods for domestic sale in various shops must be sold out before the end of September. Those unsold within the limited time will be purchased by the Trade Commission or its designated agency at a given price, for foreign residents in China to purchase for their own use, or by government agencies for entertaining foreign guests. If they are not handed over to the Trade Commission by the deadline and are still sold or transferred, they will be confiscated.

### Electric Bulb Factories Gather to Discuss Promoting Export Sales

Last night, seven leading electric bulb factories in the city, including Daming, Dahua, and Daxin, convened a meeting at the Zhimei Restaurant to discuss ways to promote overseas trade. Mr. Wang Haibo, the Chinese manager of the Global Trust Company, who has extensive experience in international trade, was invited to attend and provide guidance. During the meeting, the export of electric bulbs, such as forming an industry association, increasing production, improving quality, and standardizing products, were discussed in detail. They also planned to cooperate with the Global Trust Company, which is good news for the export of domestic goods.

### Shanghai Municipal National Construction Savings Changed to Frugality Savings

Anyone Depositing One Yuan or More Can Open an Account

Savings Certificates Temporarily Not Issued Due to Circumstances

During a period when the entire nation is working hard on construction, it is essential for people to practice thrift and savings, concentrating financial resources so that the government can use huge amounts of funds to expand production and construction projects. It is also necessary to cultivate good savings habits among the people to foster social economic strength.

Implementation Method

Since the establishment of the National Savings and Construction Savings Movement Committee, specific implementation methods have been agreed upon: (1) Expanding publicity to make the public understand the significance and voluntarily participate in savings, benefiting both themselves and the country, cultivating a social atmosphere of thrift, and providing funds for production and construction projects, making a profound contribution to the future of national construction. (2) Organizing National Savings and Construction Savings Groups, relying on the existing institutions of the central ministries, provincial and municipal governments, and domestic organizations to promote savings policies to achieve significant results. (3) Organizing Thrift Promotion Committees, soliciting volunteers to participate in the service. Committees have been established in Chongqing, Chengdu, Kunming, Lanzhou, Guiyang, Xi'an, Guilin, Yuanling, Shaoguan, Ganzhou, Yongan, Yongkang, and other places, and incentive measures have been established to encourage them.

Savings Certificates Not Issued

The four banks of Xingzhong, Jiaotong, Nong, and the Central Trust Bureau Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau have agreed on a revised method to facilitate savings for depositors. For overseas Chinese, the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau will formulate a method for purchasing savings certificates through correspondence. Although savings certificates have not been issued temporarily in the Shanghai concession area due to environmental reasons, savings deposits have already been opened. Anyone wishing to purchase savings certificates can switch to savings deposits. Anyone depositing one yuan or more can open an account, but the principal can only be withdrawn after five years from the date of deposit.

### Authorities Coordinate Vessels for Group Purchase of Rice

National Government Authorizes Agencies to Investigate and Punish Monopoly

The National Government reported that the rice price in Shanghai was being monopolized. Therefore, the authorities are determined to punish those who manipulate the Shanghai rice market. All the agreed-upon methods have been authorized to be strictly implemented by relevant agencies and organizations in the city. If anyone repeats the old tricks and manipulates large quantities of rice, they will be severely punished according to regulations. The authorities will also order the leading rice industry groups and companies in the city to consider the overall situation, overcome difficulties together, actively purchase foreign rice, and promptly dispose of it within the assessed price limit. The Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee's situation will also be carefully studied.

Authorities Meeting

Furthermore, sources revealed that the authorities of the two concessions had repeatedly discussed concrete measures to stabilize the entire food supply in Shanghai. The authorities convened another meeting a few days ago, and all key personnel attended and deliberated on the requests made by the Shanghai Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee. Regarding the group purchase of rice, it was decided to convene agents from various industries to urge them to determine the amount of foreign rice to be ordered by telegram from overseas, and to coordinate vessels for transportation. The authorities will also seriously discuss all points requested by the Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee after receiving the letter.

Hong Kong Transit

Various rumors in the rice market are merely tricks of speculative rice merchants. Recently, as the situation in Vietnam became tense again and war seemed imminent, speculators seized the opportunity to spread rumors, claiming that the Hong Kong authorities had issued a so-called "ban on rice exports" order as a precautionary measure. After obtaining this information, a reporter from the New Voice News Agency inquired from relevant parties. According to a reliable report, the Hong Kong authorities had long taken this measure, not just today, and it only applied to a portion of rice. Rice ordered by merchants for transit or other ports is not subject to this restriction and can still be exported smoothly and issued with export certificates. Therefore, there is no need to worry about the source of foreign rice being cut off. The rumors of speculative rice merchants are not factual.

Pharmaceutical Industry Group Purchase

The Shanghai New Pharmaceutical Industry Association notified all pharmacies yesterday to set a deadline for ordering rice, in response to a letter from the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce forwarding a request from the Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee for all industries to purchase rice in groups. Pharmacies wishing to order rice should submit a detailed list of the number of bags within three days of receiving the letter (with a deposit of forty yuan in cash or immediate check for each bag) for booking.

Evaluation Work

Although the Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee is currently requesting guidance from the authorities, its work has not stopped. The two members, Zhang Nianxuan and Qu Zhenhua, previously requested resignation, but were unable to be retained despite various efforts. For now, Fu Qianceng is temporarily presiding over the work.

Reasons for Black Market

Although there are hidden worries about the future of the city's food supply, there is no fear of shortage. Foreign rice from Saigon, Siam, and other places can still be continuously supplied to Shanghai. To balance rice prices and clear the source, the primary task is to clear the sources, and though the procedures are not easy, where there's a will there's a way, and one cannot give up because of the difficulty. Secondly, the unsound market organization should not be glossed over. Generally speaking, so-called manipulation and speculation are mostly transactions between firms. Before the war, the market transactions were quite orderly, with retail sales to firms and firms to companies, without any violations. Now, retail sales are to firms, and firms still turn to transactions with firms, neglecting the rice shops. Such private transactions produce a black market. The larger rice firms in the city, about twenty or so, can control the city's food supply. If the authorities can strictly prohibit transactions between firms, and make efforts to clear the sources of supply, the city's food problem will not be as serious as it is now.

### Unresolved Dispute at the Lone Battalion Barracks, Heavily Guarded on All Sides

White Russian Guards Prevent News Vendors From Entering and Exiting

Gifts of Mooncakes Also Prevented

The dispute between the Lone Battalion and the White Russian business group at the Jiaozhou Road Lone Battalion Barracks, which began the morning before yesterday, has not been resolved. One wave subsides only for another to rise. Around 9:00 a.m. yesterday, another dispute occurred, but it was not serious and did not lead to a violent incident. The reason was that after the dispute between the two sides the day before, White Russian guards blocked all the passages outside the barracks with barbed wire, preventing people from entering and exiting. Yesterday morning, a news vendor went to deliver newspapers, but the White Russian guards refused to allow him to enter. The news vendor, not understanding the reason, insisted on entering, which led to him being forcibly pushed out by the White Russians. The soldiers of the Lone Battalion expressed dissatisfaction with the harsh restrictions imposed by the White Russian guards and immediately protested to the White Russians. The two sides were at loggerheads, and the situation was very tense. It was not until 4:00 p.m. that Major Mann, the White Russian guard in charge of the barracks, arrived. After the Lone Battalion negotiated with him, Chinese newspapers were finally allowed to be delivered.

Representatives of Both Sides Negotiated Yesterday

Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 p.m., Yuguo Business Group Commander Henry, accompanied by White Russian Captain Mann and representatives from the Public Works Department, drove to the Lone Battalion Barracks to negotiate with four representatives appointed by Commander Xie, the vice captains of the Lone Battalion. At that time, White Russian guards were stationed on the nearby roads and around the barracks. The meeting lasted 45 minutes before it concluded. Henry and the representatives from the Public Works Department left the barracks first, while Mann remained until the evening before leaving. The outcome of the negotiations was not known, but judging from the fact that the passage to the barracks remained blocked after the meeting, it seems that no progress was made. As of 7:00 p.m. last night, there was still no report of the dispute being resolved.

External Traffic Still Blocked

As of 7:00 p.m. last night, the passage between the barracks and the outside was still blocked. All letters, items, and visitors were prohibited from entering, and telephone communication was cut off. Even the soldiers of the barracks were not allowed to go out to buy vegetables, leaving hundreds of Lone Battalion soldiers to eat only white rice for two days. Yesterday, people from all walks of life who went to give mooncakes were also prohibited from entering. Yesterday afternoon, after White Russian Captain Mann arrived at the barracks, he began to deploy security measures. Two White Russian guards with guns and bayonets patrolled on Jiaozhou Road and Singapore Road near the barracks. A team of police officers from the Public Concession also patrolled the area. Three armed White Russians were stationed in the Public Works Department Elementary School adjacent to the barracks, setting up posts outside the barracks walls and installing electric lights for long-term occupation.

### French Ambassador's Wife Departed for Peiping the Day Before Yesterday

Will Stay in North China for Several Weeks

The wife of the French Ambassador, Mrs. Cosme, left Shanghai for Peiping the day before yesterday (14th) and will stay in North China for several weeks. Mrs. Cosme only took two daughters on this trip, Alice and Marie-Therese.

### Zhenhai Disaster Relief Association Raises Funds to Purchase Clothes and Rice

The Shanghai Relief Zhenhai Emergency Relief Committee has received a telegram from the Zhenhai branch stating that the association has handled burials and established shelters after the war, housing more than 500 refugees. It has also set up shelters in Baojiayang, Maoyang Temple, Niwan and other places, housing more than 600 refugees. These shelters are still being maintained. Rice alone requires more than 6,000 yuan per month. Other disaster victims who have not entered the shelters have been surveyed separately and given emergency relief. With winter approaching, the problem of winter clothing for the refugees needs to be prepared urgently. Therefore, we ask for quick fundraising. The association has held a meeting and decided on the following matters: 1. Purchase 1,000 piculs of rice from the Ningbo Grain Management Office, costing about 35,000 yuan, for refugee food and general winter relief. 2. Purchase 500 bolts of cloth in Shanghai, costing about 15,000 yuan, to make 2,500 sets of winter clothing. The above three plans are in line with the needs of the refugees. If there are insufficient funds, the founders will raise and pay the difference.

### Former Municipal Government's Deposited Engineering Vehicles Transferred Without Authorization

Mayor Yu Hongjun Will File a Protest

When the National Army withdrew from Greater Shanghai, dozens of road rollers, gravel trucks, and engineering vehicles used by the Municipal Public Works Bureau for road construction were not taken away because they were heavy and cumbersome. They were deposited with the French Municipal Council's Fenglin Bridge Engineering Office for safekeeping. Recently, a certain party learned of this and repeatedly negotiated with the Municipal Council to request the transfer. It is learned that the French authorities issued an order the day before yesterday to transfer all the vehicles to a certain party to be transported away. It is heard that former Mayor Yu Hongjun will file a serious protest.

### Second Phase of British Community Fund to be Remitted to London This Month

Various Organizations Send Telegrams to Comfort Disaster Victims

British Nationals Enlisting to Leave This Week

The British community in Shanghai is deeply concerned about the continuous bombing of London. In addition to the British Community War Fund Association allocating £2,500 to be remitted for relief, many British merchants and firms have also been actively making donations. According to those in charge of the British Community War Fund Association, the second phase of the British Community War Fund is still planned to be remitted to the UK within September. The association still hopes that British nationals will continue to actively contribute. The collection point was previously located in the British Residents Association in China at 27 The Bund, but has recently been moved to the Asiatic Petroleum Company Building on the Bund. According to those related to the British Residents Association in China, after London was severely bombed, British community groups in Shanghai sent telegrams to express their condolences and to declare their determination to resist the war, saying that indiscriminate bombing would not destroy their determination to resist the war.

Many British Nationals in Shanghai Leaving to Enlist

British nationals in Shanghai, considering that the war against Germany will not end in the short term, have been enlisting in their home country. Those leaving Shanghai this time include Mr. Gerber, Deputy Director of the Municipal Council, Mr. Evans of the Shanghai Power Company, Mr. Woodhead, and more than 70 others. According to reporters, Mr. Glover, a Western police inspector in the Shanghai Municipal Police Department, has also resigned and will be leaving Shanghai for Malaya in the Eastern Territories to enlist in the military in the short term. Mr. Glover has worked in Shanghai for ten years. According to sources, he and his wife and children are scheduled to leave Shanghai on the 23rd of this month. Mr. Glover's friends held a farewell party for him at the Police Department Club on the evening of the 14th. Mr. Boer, a detective in the British Taxation Bureau, has also resigned to join the army. According to a reporter from the New Voice News Agency, all British nationals in Shanghai who have enlisted will leave Shanghai this week and transfer to their respective locations for service.

The company expressed great sympathy for the labor side, so it may be resolved satisfactorily without opening negotiations.

### American Cargo Ship Returns to Shanghai From Wenzhou, Detained for Two Weeks, Passenger Mrs. Smith Suffers From Epidemic, Quarantine Flag Hoisted Upon Arrival Yesterday Morning

According to the Shanghai Thames News, the American Coastal Trading Company (translated meaning)'s cargo ship Estelle "L", docked at The Bund No. 12, returned to Shanghai from Wenzhou yesterday (14th). It is heard that the ship was detained by the Japanese authorities at (Likang) while returning to Shanghai. Previously, the ship docked in Wenzhou for a week. Two days after sailing out on August 25, it was detained by a Japanese warship. A team of Japanese soldiers boarded the ship, inspected the documents, and ordered the ship to sail to nearby Likang. The reason for the detention was not disclosed, but many believe that the ship was detained because it sailed out of the port of Wenzhou, which was (blockaded) by the Japanese. After two weeks, it was allowed to load the goods transported in Wenzhou and continue sailing to Shanghai. It arrived here yesterday morning and is now docked in front of Wharf No. 3 on the Bund. When the ship arrived in Shanghai, it hoisted a yellow flag, indicating that there was a sick passenger on board, so it was subject to quarantine. An ambulance also drove to the wharf to take Mrs. Smith, a passenger suffering from dysentery for five days, to Hongen Hospital.

### Demanding Money Unsuccessfully, Injuring Grandmother, Defendant Released on Bail and Then Rearrested

Shen Qiusheng (24 years old), a local resident residing at No. 3, Lane 774, Haining Road, is known for his violent nature. Recently, because he failed to demand 200 yuan from his grandmother, Shen Zhang (66 years old), he beat her at 1:55 a.m. on August 8, causing injuries to her chest and back. After being reported by someone who hired a car to the Huisi Police Station under its jurisdiction, detectives rushed to the address and took Shen Qiusheng to the police station for detention, and transferred him to the First Special District Court. Police Lawyer Zhang Tianyin filed a public prosecution for the crime of injuring a relative. However, the victim, Shen Zhang, was transferred by the police to the Tibetan Road Refugee Hospital for treatment, but had not recovered and was unable to testify in court. When questioned, the defendant admitted to beating his grandmother, saying that it was a family dispute and that his wife had falsely accused him. The confession was cunning. He hired a lawyer to request bail to go out and await trial. The court, because the victim Shen Zhang had not arrived, ordered Shen Qiusheng to be released on bail to return home and beg Shen Zhang to withdraw the lawsuit. Yesterday, Judge Jiang visited the court for continued trial. Police Lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that the victim Shen Zhang was still in the hospital recovering. The defendant also did not go to the hospital to ask her to forgive him. Lawyer Fan Gang arrived in court and stated that Shen Zhang was actually injured by the accused and given a settlement. The case was adjourned to another date. Before the trial, the court ordered Shen Zhang to be examined by the court's medical examiner for verification of the injuries. The defendant was still released on the original bail.

### Imitation Trademark, Another Lawsuit Involving Tiger, Turtle, Bear, and Deer

The Meiling Western Medicine Store at No. 614 Nanjing Road was founded by Chen Taiyan from Ningbo. The "Tiger Bear Deer" kidney tonifying pills issued by the store have been registered with the Trademark Bureau and have a special use certificate. Previously, the Liu San Drug Store claimed that Chen's Tiger, Turtle, Bear, and Deer were imitating its products, and hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the First Special Court. Chen Taiyan won the case. Unexpectedly, not long after the verdict, the Xinsheng Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory opened by Han Ruiyou at No. 1, Tongfu Lane, Jing'an Temple Road, published a large advertisement in the newspaper, stating that the Tiger, Turtle, Bear, and Deer pills were "Bear Tiger Turtle Kidney Strengthening Pills." Chen Taiyan saw this and believed that the advertisement was extremely damaging. He investigated the Bear Tiger Deer produced by the Xinsheng Pharmaceutical Factory with the Trademark Bureau and found that they had not applied for registration in accordance with the law. So he hired lawyer Qian Xingzhong to file a criminal complaint in the First Special Court against Han Ruiyou, the owner of the Xinsheng Pharmaceutical Factory, for the crime of obstructing agriculture, industry, and commerce and defamation, requesting that he be punished according to law. The First Special Court summoned the defendant Han Ruiyou yesterday afternoon, but he did not arrive. After the plaintiff's lawyer Qian Xingzhong stated the case, the court ordered that the defendant be summoned to court again at a later date for further investigation.

### Two Blood Cases Yesterday Morning, Victims Died One After Another, One Was Ah Chang Factory Employee Wei Yaoxing, One Was Japanese Merchant Liu Ying on Xinglu Street

Yesterday morning, two blood cases occurred in the Hongkou and Western Shanghai districts. One was Liu Ying, a salesman for the Japanese Yonghua Cloth Shop, who was shot and killed on the spot. The other was Wei Yaoxing, an employee of the Xie Fenghua Silk Factory, who also died due to serious injuries. The details obtained by reporters from the Social News Agency are recorded below:

Factory Employee Killed on the Way

At 8:40 a.m. yesterday, Wei Yaodian, a 28-year-old employee of the Xie Fenghua Silk Factory from Shaoxing, was leaving his residence at No. 19, Hede New Village, Hede Road, intending to go to the factory to work. Unexpectedly, when he was riding in a rickshaw and passing the corner of Hede Road near Binye Road, a man suddenly caught sight of Wei and immediately drew a gun and fired at Wei. The bullet hit Wei in the chest and exited from the left side. Wei fell from the rickshaw into a pool of blood. The gunman fled without a trace. Wei was taken to the Tongren Second Hospital on nearby Linan Road for treatment, but died from his injuries at around 2:00 p.m. The police are currently investigating the reason for the attack.

Disguised as Gift Giver, Drawing a Gun to Commit Murder

Around 9:00 a.m. on the same day, Liu Ying (also known as You), a resident of Sichuan residing on the second floor of No. 6, Jingyi Lane, No. 360 Wuchang Road, Hongkou, and his wife Xu have lived there for a long time. At the time of the incident, Liu was in the room. Suddenly, two men wearing blue long gowns and short jackets, carrying four kinds of gifts such as mooncakes, claimed to be coming to give gifts. They went upstairs and gently knocked on the door. Liu opened the door. Unexpectedly, the visitors saw Liu and immediately drew a gun and fired one shot at Liu, hitting Liu's right temple and exiting the back of his head. Blood flowed everywhere, and he fell into a pool of blood at the doorway. The gunman, seeing that his purpose had been achieved, hurriedly went downstairs and fled without a trace. Afterwards, the police summoned a car to take Liu to Shanghai Sanatorium for treatment, but he died before reaching the hospital due to his serious injuries. It is learned that Liu was previously named Liu Yuying and once worked for the Shanghai Charity Federation Joint Disaster Relief Association. He is now a salesman for the Japanese Yonghua Cloth Shop in the Zhengjin Bank Building on the Bund. However, it is heard that the police found various documents and other items in Liu's residence after the incident. The case is either a vendetta or something else, which is still being secretly investigated.

### Woman Bookkeeper at Gambling Den Abandons Husband and Refuses to Return Home; Husband Sues for Cohabitation, Both Parties Argue, Judgment Pending

Zhou Mengyun, a local resident currently residing at 223 McTyeire Road in East Shanghai, is thirty years old. He owns a store in Hongkou and has more than ten acres of land (nicknamed "Little Tycoon Zhou"). In 1932, he married Gu Xiumei, a local woman, through a matchmaker. Gu is twenty-six years old this year, with a pleasing appearance and

good at socializing. Her elder brother, Gu Huanzhang, runs the Gu Chunji shoe store on Nanjing Road near Hubei Road and also owns a leather factory on Connaught Road. After Gu married Zhou, because their families were well-matched, the couple's relationship was initially quite harmonious. They have a daughter named Tanli, who is seven years old, and another daughter named Beili, who is four years old. After the Shanghai war broke out, Zhou and Gu fled as refugees and lived on Baker Road. Zhou's situation became increasingly difficult. In 1938, Gu then

abandoned her husband and daughters and went to work as a bookkeeper in a gambling den in West Shanghai. After Gu was influenced by this special social environment, she lost contact with her husband, and her behavior became quite mysterious. Recently, Gu entrusted lawyer Jin Naihui to publish an advertisement stating that her husband's whereabouts were unknown. Zhou, upon seeing the advertisement, feared that Gu had ulterior motives and recently hired lawyer Huang Huancheng to file a complaint with the First Special Court's Civil Division, requesting a judgment ordering Gu to return home

to live with him. Yesterday, Judge Mo Runhua opened the Second Civil Court to summon both parties. Both parties, accompanied by their lawyers, appeared in court to await the hearing. The plaintiff, Zhou Mengyun, brought his two daughters to court and testified that the children need a mother. The defendant, Gu, abandoned her own daughters, which shows her sinister intentions. However, according to the Civil Code, husband and wife have an obligation to cohabitate, so he requested the court to order the defendant to return home to live with him. The plaintiff's lawyer, Huang Huancheng, said to the court that the two parties in this case were originally harmonious, but in recent years, the defendant

at the gambling den, saw money like waste paper, so she left the plaintiff for two years, without any regard. The defendant, Gu Xiumei, then testified that she used to work as a bookkeeper in a gambling den, but now she works in a hospital. The plaintiff's request for cohabitation requires him to provide assurance that there will be no financial worries. The court gently advised both parties to reconcile, but the defendant firmly opposed unconditional cohabitation. After examining the arguments, the court ordered both parties to debate and then announced the end of the hearing, with the judgment scheduled for the nineteenth of this month.

### Speculative Trading Losses: Chen Xisheng Accused; Broker Sues for Over RMB 20,000 in Unpaid Debts; Court Summons Both Parties, Each Holding Different Arguments

A man named Chen Xisheng, who lives in Xieqiao Alley in the Public Concession, has been indulging in speculative trading in recent years. On May 6 of this year, he deposited RMB 2,500 in cash into the Runheng Company on the fifth floor of the Stock Exchange, entrusting the company's broker, Ding Zhiming, to

buy and sell stocks, not spot goods, but to calculate profits and losses based on the difference between buying and selling prices. On May 13 of this year, Ding Zhiming bought more than a thousand shares of various stocks for Chen Xisheng. By the 24th of the same month, because Chen Xisheng did not express any opinions, Ding Zhiming sold all of the stocks, resulting in Chen Xisheng losing a total of RMB 26,352.25. Ding Zhiming repeatedly demanded payment from Chen Xisheng verbally and in writing, but Chen Xisheng

ignored him. Therefore, Ding Zhiming recently hired lawyer E Sen to file a complaint with the First Special Court's Civil Division, accusing Chen Xisheng and requesting a judgment to compensate RMB 26,352.25 in national currency. After receiving the complaint, the court opened the Second Civil Court a few days ago with Judge Mo Runhua presiding. The plaintiff, Ding Zhiming, accompanied by lawyer Na Sen, appeared in court and stated the intent of the lawsuit, briefly stating that the defendant, Chen Xisheng, entrusted the plaintiff to buy various stocks on May 13 of this year. According to the regulations, he should have stated whether to sell or retain them on May 17. If he did not clearly state, then according to the regulations, he should have settled the account by May 20. At that time,

stock prices plummeted. By May 24, the defendant still had not expressed any opinions, so the plaintiff had no choice but to sell on behalf of the defendant. The defendant owes RMB 26,352.25, and he requested the court to order the defendant to pay, etc. Subsequently, Tao Wuzhi, the defendant Chen Xisheng's agent lawyer, argued that according to the Exchange's regulations, when a client entrusts a broker to buy and sell various non-spot goods, the client pays a margin. If the difference exceeds the amount of the margin, the broker should immediately

notify the client to increase the margin or immediately settle the transaction. In this case, the defendant paid a margin of RMB 2,500. When the difference exceeded the margin amount, the plaintiff did not follow this procedure. Now, even if there is a loss of more than RMB 20,000, the defendant has no obligation to pay. He requested the court to reject the plaintiff's lawsuit, etc. After examining the arguments, the court announced that the case would be adjourned to October 12 for another hearing. During the adjournment, it hoped that both parties would reconcile.

### Charity Basketball Warm-Up Game Opens Yesterday: 54-34, An Unprecedented Fierce Battle; First Half Undecided, Only Six Points Difference

The charity basketball challenge, which has received attention from all parties and enthusiastic sponsorship, opened at the YMCA last night at 8:00 PM in the sound of the national anthem and military music. The Youlian team led the way, and the first battle was against the Paramount team. In an extremely tense atmosphere, the Paramount team won 54-34. The first half was played vigorously, 20-14, with Youlian only trailing by six points. The tension and excitement of the battle were unexpected. It is a pity that Youlian lacked stamina. The second battle was between the Shanghai Stars and the Paramount team on Thursday night at the YMCA.

Zhu Daxun Generously Donates Again

Last night, philanthropists flocked to the YMCA basketball court, which was full, with about six or seven hundred people. This shows that doing good is the greatest joy, and everyone feels the same way. During the halftime break, a ball auction was held, conducted by Yuan Ludeng, chairman of the Orphanage. The starting price was fifty yuan, and after competition, the great philanthropist Zhu Daxun bought the ball for 450 yuan. Mr. Zhu had just bought the Sichuan United charity game ball for 500 yuan last week, and yesterday he generously donated again, his benevolence and righteous deeds are truly admirable.

First Half Performance Was Wonderful

Youlian's performance last night was outstanding. The defense was mutually supportive, and their strength increased greatly. The Paramount team was unable to deploy in the first half. After Mr. Yuan Ludeng performed the opening ball ceremony, the two sides immediately engaged. Xiao Lu made a shot to open the scoring. The Paramount team missed both free throws. Li Zhenzhong and Xu Wenkui made one shot and one free throw, taking the lead 3-2. Ren Xiangcheng and Xiao Lu made two wonderful shots, and Youlian took the lead again 6-3. At this time, the two sides kept running and the offense and defense were flying, and they fell into extreme tension for a while. Youlian has always been in the lead 7-5, 8-7, 10-9. After Lu Shungen was transferred in, the Paramount team gradually began to look up. Feng Nianhua was transferred in, and the Paramount team came from behind with 20-14 in the first half, leading by six points.

Lacking Stamina, Youlian Suffered a Defeat

The Youlian team members are young and strong, and move like flying, but because they over-connect, they often make too many passing mistakes, and waste a lot of balls. Xiao Lu's wonderful shots are still continuous. The Paramount team's strength lies in always fighting calmly. Although Xianglong was absent, Xu Wenkui and Bao Songyuan had an unexpectedly good performance last night. In the second half, the Youlian team's speed slowed down due to the intense fighting in the first half, and gradually fell behind. The Paramount team was on the rise, Bao Songyuan, Feng Nianhua, Xu Wenkui, joined forces to attack, and the score difference gradually increased. The final result was 54-34.

Hope the Audience Strictly Observes Order

The audience in yesterday's game often blamed the referee, and there were whistles and criticisms of the players' performances of both sides, which were inappropriate. It should be known that the players and the audience are all serving charity. So-called victory is certainly gratifying, and defeat is not humiliating. It is appropriate to strongly support. Even if we put aside the charitable stance, this kind of hissing sound also represents psychological immaturity. We sincerely hope that from now on, we will be calm and aim to appreciate the skills of the game, then the order will not be disrupted.

### The Reality of China's Bumper Harvests Over the Past Three Years

— Chen Huazhang

As the saying goes, "Food is the paramount necessity of the people," and "Years of famine lead to chaos under heaven, while years of abundant harvests bring peace to the world." This adequately illustrates the importance of grain in normal times. As for wartime, its importance is a hundredfold greater than in peacetime. Therefore, the ancients, in discussing warfare, placed equal emphasis on sufficient food and sufficient arms, and as the common saying goes, "Before the troops move, provisions must go ahead." From the above sayings passed down through the ages, it is not difficult to understand the importance of the food issue. After the outbreak of China's sacred war of resistance, the price of rice soared, reaching over a hundred yuan per stone; while in Taizhou, only three hundred li away, the price of rice was only ten-odd yuan per stone. This can be said to be a unique local situation, a local problem. The above examples are sufficient to prove that China's food supply is by no means insufficient; however, due to a lack of management, we cannot deny it.

Let's look at Free China. Since the beginning of the war of resistance three years ago, we have had bumper harvests every year, and the extent of these harvests has been increasing year by year. Therefore, based on the facts of the bumper harvests over the past three years, the public's previous views on the food issue must be revised. In other words, China's food supply is not a problem; moreover, there is even a surplus. Now, let's consider the rice production in the provinces of Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan. According to Mr. Zhang Xinyi's calculations, Sichuan province produces 17,491,000 dan of rice, with a consumption of 11,894,600 dan, leaving a surplus of 5,345,000 dan. In the case of Guizhou province's rice production, the reason for [illegible] is that some consumers prefer foreign rice and wheat, as the quality of some foreign rice and wheat is better than that of domestic rice and wheat, suiting the tastes of those who lead a luxurious lifestyle. Therefore, ports such as Shanghai, Ningbo, Guangzhou, and Tianjin are all important ports for the import of foreign rice, while the inland areas do not have the habit of eating foreign rice. Currently, the price of domestic rice in Shanghai is sixty to seventy yuan per stone, which is entirely the result of special circumstances. In places like Ningguo, Zhejiang, although foreign rice and wheat are imported every year, it cannot be said that this indicates a shortage of food in China. The reason for this is, on the one hand, the inconvenience of transportation, making it easier for coastal provinces to purchase foreign rice than domestic rice from the interior; on the other hand, the severity of the food problem is actually not that great. Because China is an agricultural country, with [illegible] resources, it cannot be compared with an industrial country or a country with scarce resources. Guizhou produces 7,523,000 dan of rice, with a consumption of 3,684,000 dan, leaving a surplus of 683,000 dan. Yunnan produces 16,251,000 dan of rice, with a consumption of 18,143,000 dan, leaving a surplus of 8,208,000 dan. As a result of the bumper harvests every year, the actual harvest should be higher than this average figure; moreover, as the government authorities advocate increased production and improved seeds, the yield will certainly increase significantly.

What are the achievements of the bumper harvests in the past three years? According to a survey conducted by the Central Agricultural Experiment Station in the provinces of Ningxia, Qinghai, Gansu, and Shaanxi in the Northwest; Henan, Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi in Central China; Zhejiang, Fujian, and Shandong along the coast; and Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou in the Southwest, covering a total of fourteen provinces and five hundred and sixty-nine counties, the statistics on the production situation in the twenty-eighth year [of the Republic, i.e. 1939] are as follows:

What is particularly commendable is that the total harvest of the above fourteen provinces in the twenty-eighth year was much higher than the average figures for the seven years from the twentieth to the twenty-sixth years [of the Republic, i.e. 1931-1937]. The increased quantities were: 57,947,000 dan of japonica rice; 4,723,000 dan of sorghum; 1,244,000 dan of [illegible]; 7,500,000 dan of [glutinous rice]; 3,965,000 dan of maize; 2,546,000 dan of soybeans; 56,832,000 dan of sweet potatoes; 1,033,000 dan of cotton; 2,340,000 dan of peanuts; 640,000 dan of sesame seeds; 7,274,000 dan of tobacco; 27,890,000 dan of wheat; and 7,261,000 dan of barley. Among the total harvests in the twenty-eighth year, only glutinous rice decreased, with a shortage of 952,000 dan compared to the average quantity from the twentieth to the twenty-sixth years. (Note: 1 dan = 110.231 pounds) What about this year? The severe drought at the beginning of June, to be honest, made many people worried, and made the people living in the mountains indescribably anxious. Fortunately, Heaven had eyes, and from June 30th, widespread rain began. This timely rain, from Gansu and Shaanxi in the north to Yunnan and Guangxi in the south, was widely distributed. Sufficient rainfall in July completely dispelled people's worries about the drought. In the telegraph received on July 16th [illegible] in Yang County reported that due to the timely rain in Diezhou, this year's harvest can be expected to be [illegible] (the so-called ten percent bumper harvest is purely theoretical). Except for Sichuan province, other provinces have no worries about crop failures. Provinces such as Guizhou and Yunnan, which used to have crop failures, will also have bumper harvests this year. The annual harvests in Hunan, [illegible], Fujian, Guangxi, and Guangdong are even better, and the situation in the provinces of Hebei and [illegible] in the north is also quite promising. A telegram received on August 7th stated that, in general, the amount of rainfall in various counties in central Shaanxi was appropriate, the summer harvest was abundant, and a bumper autumn harvest is also expected. [illegible] telegram from a certain place in Shandong on August 8th [illegible] Shandong is a rice-producing area. Since the beginning of the war, the weather has been favorable, and an early harvest has been reported. The [illegible] has already been sown, and farmers are celebrating. 2. A telegram from Changsha on August 9th: 1. This year, the rainfall is favorable, and Hunan province is celebrating another bumper harvest. Counties around Dongting Lake, such as Huarong and Xiangyin, have already begun harvesting. Local troops are helping farmers to harvest rice, which is a sign of victory. 2. All of this is sufficient to illustrate the abundant harvest of food in China this year.

According to reports from the Central Agricultural Experiment Station, the summer harvests of Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Jiangxi, Guangxi, Hubei, Ningxia, Qinghai, Gansu, Shaanxi, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Fujian, and Zhejiang, fourteen provinces can reach 70% of the best harvest year: 91,850,000 dan of [rice]; 23,565,000 dan of [rice]; 36,005,000 dan of other [grains]; 19,814,000 dan of peanuts; 9,434,000 dan of tobacco; 51,791,000 dan of glutinous rice; 23,790,000 dan of sorghum; 66,775,000 dan of grains; 5,725,000 dan of cotton; 7,736,000 dan of sesame; 231,976,000 dan of sweet potatoes. As for the quantity of winter harvest, it is estimated as follows: 202,184,000 dan of wheat; 42,104,000 dan of peas; 82,037,000 dan of barley; 45,106,000 dan of rapeseed; 46,990,000 dan of broad beans. The harvest figures this year are still estimates, and the actual harvest should be greater than these figures. (Note: 1 dan = 33.3 pounds)

Facing such abundant harvests, on the one hand, we should be grateful for the favorable weather conditions provided by Heaven; on the other hand, we should also attribute it to the various measures taken by the government authorities. The main ones are outlined below:

(1) Adjustment of agricultural finance: Since the beginning of the war, the government authorities can be said to have spared no effort in adjusting rural finance. The Hankou Financial Conference in the twenty-seventh year [of the Republic, i.e. 1938] stipulated the following financial policies: (2) Local financial institutions should establish agricultural product warehouses; (3) Increase agricultural product mortgages; (4) Increase loans for agricultural machinery; (5) Increase loans for agricultural water conservancy projects; farmers can use warehouse agricultural products as collateral for loans. Local authorities have actively implemented these policies. Banks in various places are also competing to make loans to rural areas. Taking the Farmers Bank of China as an example, according to Mr. Chen Qinghua's article "Rural Loans of the Farmers Bank of China During the War," the figures for various rural loans are: (1) The total amount of cooperative loans reached more than 50 million yuan; (2) The amount of cooperative treasury loans was more than 38 million yuan; (3) The amount of agricultural warehouse loans was more than 2.6 million yuan, and later a special fund of 12 million yuan was allocated to handle agricultural product mortgage loans; (4) The amount of district relief loans was more than 8 million yuan; (5) The amount of war zone relief loans was more than 10 million yuan; (6) The amount of loans was 10 million yuan; (7) [illegible] reached more than 8.4 million yuan, totaling approximately 120 million yuan. The Agricultural Finance Bureau of China also made great [illegible] to rural finance after the war of resistance. (8) This year, a huge sum of 22 million yuan was specially lent to poor farmers. According to accounting, the total amount of rural loans from financial institutions across the country is at least over 150 million yuan. Such a large amount of funds flowing into the countryside and circulating will certainly be sufficient to promote large-scale agricultural production.

(2) Implementation of agricultural water conservancy: The success of water conservancy is a major plan to eradicate natural disasters. Most of these water conservancy projects focus on the northwestern provinces. For example, the Mei-Hui [illegible] in Shaanxi irrigates 200,000 mu of farmland, and the Luo-Hui-Liang [illegible] irrigates 500,000 mu of farmland.... In recent years, water conservancy projects in the southwestern provinces have also continued to be carried out. The Dujiangyan [irrigation system] in Sichuan was completed last spring, benefiting more than 2.6 million mu of farmland in fourteen counties in western Sichuan; the Zhengze Weir in Santai was also completed last year, benefiting the farmland in northern Sichuan significantly. In addition, there are still many [projects] under construction in the southwestern and northwestern provinces.

(3) Establishment of agricultural warehouses: The role of agricultural warehouses is to eliminate the exploitation of farmers and prevent the manipulation of speculators. After the outbreak of the war, in addition to urging various provinces to promote the agricultural warehouse business in accordance with the Agricultural Warehouse [illegible] and the Provisional Measures for Simplified Agricultural Warehouses in Times of Emergency, the Ministry of Economic Affairs also managed it under the overall planning of the Agricultural Finance Bureau. According to He Lian, by the end of October last year, 92 agricultural [illegible] warehouses had been established, with a capacity of 2,247,415 shi. In addition, 27 more are under construction. By the end of September last year, the cumulative amount of mortgage loans from various warehouses was 1,000,461,58 yuan, with a balance of 358,446,94 yuan. The total value of storage managed by various warehouses was nearly 3 million yuan, and the total value of purchases and sales was more than 600,000 yuan.

(4) Immigration and land reclamation: Since the beginning of the war, the number of refugees fleeing from the war zones to the rear has been increasing. The government authorities, on the one hand, promulgated the Regulations on Refugee Land Reclamation in Times of Emergency, and on the other hand, sent personnel to various provinces in the southwest and northwest to investigate reclaimable wasteland. After seven months, the survey showed that there were millions of mu of reclaimable wasteland, which could accommodate 500,000垦min. In the northwest, land reclamation has already achieved considerable results.

(5) Implementation of agricultural education: In order to increase agricultural production, the Ministry of Economic Affairs decided to pay more attention to cultivating agricultural talent. It has opened training courses for agricultural extension personnel in Chongqing, which are undertaken by Jinling University, which has the most prestigious reputation in rural development in China.

In addition, there are matters related to agricultural product transportation and sales, livestock insurance, cooperative undertakings, etc., which can all promote agricultural production.

According to a Chongqing dispatch on July 30th, the Executive Yuan has established the National Grain Administration to coordinate the production, sales, storage, and transportation of grain across the country, and to regulate the relationship between supply and demand. The bureau officially started working on August 1st, with three departments for administrative control, business control, and finance, and two offices for secretarial work and research. The Administrative Control Department is responsible for matters such as grain surveys and statistics; the Business Control Department is responsible for matters such as grain production and sales. The initial work of the bureau is to understand the situation of grain across the country, especially the current situation of grain merchants and grain markets. Then, it will actively carry out grain regulation work, paying attention to the planned regulation of military and civilian food, and focusing on the rational distribution of land sections. It has already been said above that China's grain supply is by no means insufficient; however, the problem is the lack of management. Now that the National Grain Administration has been established and has begun to work, management will no longer be a problem, and undoubtedly, it will definitely achieve great results in management. Under the dual conditions of abundant grain harvest and proper management, China's grain problem has been completely solved, which is extremely gratifying to us! In summary, the great bumper harvest of grain in China over the past three years has made the foundation for victory in the War of Resistance even stronger!

### About the Mark

— Editor

As for how to distinguish between blocked Marks and free Marks, I am not very clear about the details. However, I believe that if you want to receive Marks, you may judge whether they are issued by the German-British Bank [Reichsbank] and whether the face value is ten Marks or more. All Marks of ten Marks or more issued by the Reichsbank are the only legal tender in Germany, and are the same as gold Marks (in fact, there are no gold Marks in circulation). They should not be blocked Marks and can be freely imported and exported (in fact, exports are still subject to exchange control restrictions). Other German currency or drafts should be carefully considered when receiving them. If you do not distinguish the scope of their use, it is tantamount to throwing yourself into the net, and they will be blocked. In short, the so-called blocked Marks of today are no longer a special type of currency issued during the last European war to indicate their difference from free Marks. It is also not like our country's exchange drafts, which are blocked currency, so there is no great difference in form from the [regular currency]. Other [currencies] are free currency.

Also, I remember that you previously asked about the discrepancy in the exchange rates for foreign exchange in Germany during the war. Now, I am extracting a monthly comparison table of exchange rates from the Frankfurter Zeitung [25F], covering the period from January of last year to [illegible] of this year. However, it only lists a few countries, so I will summarize it below:

As for the wartime exchange rate of the German Mark against the pound sterling overseas, it can be observed in the New York market's German exchange rate.

New York Exchange Rate for Berlin (Unit: Number of Marks per US Dollar)

Annual Average for 1929 4.2000

Annual Average for 1938 2.4905

Annual Average for 1939 2.4903

May 1940 2.4990

The above is based on the Federal Reserve Bulletin, July 1940.

### About the Czech Currency

— Editor

To Zhao Zhong [illegible], regarding your questions about the currency unit of Czechoslovakia, its current market price, and its ratio to the legal tender, here are brief answers based on what is known:

The Czech standard currency is [illegible] Kuruna, cast from [illegible] and bronze. Refer to the World Currency System Table attached to my Financial and Monetary Dictionary, which was published by the World Book Company in the 26th year of the Republic [1937].

Since Czechoslovakia was annexed by Germany, the Czech currency system has also been unified with the Mark. Therefore, the [illegible] market's records of Czech exchange rates ceased to exist after March of last year. According to the Federal Reserve Bulletin, Jan. 1904, the recent exchange rate of the Czech currency in New York is (US cents per Koruna):

Annual Average for 1929 2.9609

Annual Average for 1933 3.8232

Annual Average for 1936 4.0078

March 1938 3.4245

As for its exchange rate against the legal tender, it can be calculated by [illegible]. The average exchange rate of the US dollar against Shanghai currency in March 1938 was US$0.16016 per 1 yuan legal tender, then the chain method can be used to obtain an approximate black market exchange rate of 0.2 yuan legal tender equal to 1 Czech Koruna.

In [illegible] there are always [illegible] Czech expatriates, so Czech currency may have some [illegible] market that is not seen in Shanghai [illegible].

### Seven Questions About Public Debt

— Editor

To Liu Qi, responding to your questions:

(1) Public debt is difficult to be priced below the face value, but the principal and interest are calculated at the full face value. Therefore, the issuance of public debt should be fully raised; however, there is usually a few points of discount, one is to encourage people to buy, and the other is to [illegible] handling fees for banks, etc. Therefore, whether subscribing or allocating, it should be handled in accordance with the issuance regulations. When a bank purchases debt from the government, it is because the government uses public debt to borrow from the bank, then the amount of the loan should change with the market debt. Because subscribing to public debt is a long-term investment; while a bank accepting public debt as collateral is a short-term loan. Since it is a short-term loan, it should be considered how much capital can be recovered. If calculated at a high price, even if the government does not redeem it upon maturity, the bank can sell it on the market without loss. This situation is the same at home and abroad. There is no discrimination against various creditors at the time of issuance.

(2) The market price of public debt is purely determined by the subjective psychology of the market: there is no pricing standard. Because its reasonable standard, [illegible], there is nothing else besides the face value. However, people in the market often speculate based on the proximity of the principal and interest repayment period, the ratio of various debt market prices that are constantly maintained, etc.; this can only calculate how much the interest on investment or speculation is, and cannot determine the market price.

(3) Before the August 13th Incident, the government was worried about being disrupted by others due to the rising prices of various debts at that time, so it had set a minimum price limit. Above the price limit, it could still rise and fall freely. At that time, the minimum price limit written on the [illegible] was 76 yuan for Class A, 73 yuan and 5 jiao for Class B, 70 yuan and 5 jiao for Class C, and 70 yuan for Class D [illegible] two types. Your letter mentioned 60%, I am afraid it is wrong. This decree is still valid today, but it cannot be implemented at present due to the special environment in Shanghai.

(4) If a country suddenly has a foreign war, people will inevitably be panicked. As a result, the market is inevitably chaotic. In order to avoid such unnecessary fluctuations and to enable the economic community to calmly transition from a peaceful system to a wartime system, governments of various countries often order the suspension of operations of various centralized markets (such as exchanges) at the beginning of the war. Therefore, moments before the August 13th Incident, the government ordered the suspension of operations of various exchanges. The stock exchange was no exception; because debt credit is related to the national treasury credit, therefore, various countries, even if they allow other transactions to resume operations during the war, do not allow the stock exchange to resume operations until the war is over. If there is a black market, there is no attempt to ban it. Because of the existence of Shanghai, our country cannot only eliminate the black market, but also has to tacitly acknowledge the openness of its black transactions. The open entry of black transactions from the building of the Zhouye Bank to the building of the Stock Exchange may have been tacitly approved by the financial authorities? In our guess, the financial authorities may have to tacitly approve it for the following three reasons. First, since the national financial resources are so strong, they are not afraid of not being able to maintain [illegible] credit. Looking at the market [illegible] prices, they have been rising steadily since the opening of black transactions. Second, I firmly believe that there are many people in the stock exchange who understand the righteousness; although there are also some unscrupulous people who, only for their own speculative interests, are willing to go short and spread news that is unfavorable to the debt market in an attempt to lower the debt price. However, their power is not great, and they are far from being able to match the bulls. They are just for sacrifice. Third, the biggest reason for the government's tacit approval of the opening of black transactions may be that the relationship between purchasing, trading, and the financial market is too deep, because the financial sector increases the purchase of public debt as the main means of processing its deposits. Because purchasing public debt is like passing on the interest on customers' deposits to the national treasury, and more spillover interest can be obtained. If the stock exchange market does not resume, the financial sector will lose its portal for turning over capital. The government's tacit approval of the opening of black transactions is understandable.

(5) The [illegible] fall in debt prices, whether in peacetime or wartime, is always related to the tightness of market funds (ie silver), except for pure speculation. Its influence by the foreign exchange and gold markets is nothing more than this. Whenever speculation in the foreign exchange and gold markets is fierce, funds flow from the debt market to the foreign exchange and gold markets; conversely, they flow back. In this outgoing or incoming situation, the balance of supply and demand in the debt market is disrupted; the debt market then fluctuates. Other associations are nothing more than the [illegible] attachments of speculators.

(6) According to the regulations of the stock exchange before the war: the deposit margin for each 10,000 yuan face value of various debt markets was 600 yuan for the stock, and 800 yuan to 900 yuan for the stock, and 400 yuan for each 10,000 stock of the 1937 National Debt and 400 yuan for each 10,000 stock for the special stock, and the commission must be at least 1/1000 of the transaction amount. Entrusting a bank to purchase on behalf of is limited to spot goods. Therefore, there is no need for a margin, and at most a few handling fees are charged, and the actual rate must be smaller than the broker's commission.

(7) Purchasing public debt is superior and reliable compared to other investments. Today, it is often said that foreign exchange swaps often reach seven or eight points, but in fact, the interest rate of public debt often reaches seven or eight points or even 1 jiao and 5 points, the only difference is that this is a long-term investment. If used for speculation, the profit is also not small. Each money house often collects [illegible] public debt when the market supply exceeds demand, and its price must be low, but the price of public debt must rise, because it not only has the national treasury as the background, but can also request mortgage discount at any time. At present, each bank and money house have a background, because they all have huge amounts of public debt, and they must maintain the price of public debt in order to maintain the value of their reserves. If you are worried about the future of the money house, the people in the money house will laugh at your excessive loyalty.

Japanese Exchange Rates and Trade

The Japanese exchange rate has always maintained the benchmark of one shilling and two pence against the British pound. In August 1939, the situation in Europe became tense and war was declared. The pound [illegible] fluctuated, and its exchange rate against the US dollar fell from 4 yuan 6 jiao 8 fen to 3 yuan 8 jiao 2 fen. Japan, which was closely linked to the pound sterling, also saw its exchange rate against the US dollar fall sharply. Therefore, the exchange rate of 23 yuan and 7/16 was temporarily adopted against the US dollar, which was calculated based on the then legal exchange rate of 4.02 of the Bank of England. On October 25, it officially broke away from the pound sterling and linked to the US dollar. The biggest reason for the change at that time was that the soaring prices had become a serious problem. In order to prevent inflation, it was necessary to stabilize the exchange rate. At the same time, in order to import a large amount of military supplies from the United States, it was necessary to stabilize the US dollar exchange rate at a fixed level to avoid soaring import prices.

However, with the evolution of the British war, it continued to decline, which was quite unfavorable to Japan. Japan's international trade has a surplus with the pound sterling bloc and a deficit with the US dollar bloc. However, in recent years, exports to the pound sterling bloc have gradually decreased, and drafts to the US dollar bloc have gradually increased. This trend has become more apparent after the long-term European war. On the 13th of this month, Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka [illegible] recognized in the Japan Trade Association: 1. The European war has greatly reduced Japan's export trade, and the deterioration of relations with the United States has made the problem of obtaining major goods increasingly difficult. 2. Japan must pay in cash for goods purchased from the United States. If the pounds sterling earned in the pound sterling bloc cannot be freely exchanged for US dollars, it will be difficult for Japan to plan the funds needed to purchase military materials. At the same time, because the yen is linked to the US dollar, exports to the pound sterling bloc are greatly restricted by the high exchange rate. Because trade in the pound sterling bloc has always been able to buy Japanese goods at a market price of one shilling and two pence per yen, now it has to be purchased at a market price of one shilling and six pence (the market price in May and June this year) [illegible]. The value of Japanese goods in the pound sterling bloc has increased, which will naturally affect sales and lead to a decline in exports.

Since the UK strengthened exchange control on July 18, the free pound was equivalent to the legal pound around mid-August. As a result, the yen exchange rate also returned to its previous level of one shilling and two pence on August 14, and the London exchange rate against Japan also repeatedly fell to a purchase price of one shilling and two pence on the same day. In theory, the movement of the yen exchange rate this time should be beneficial to Japan's export trade, but the end [illegible] in Foreign Minister Matsuoka's remarks, under the circumstances of the United Kingdom's strict exchange control, Japan's export trade is still pessimistic. (End)

### Pound Sterling Stabilizes, Indian Silver Reports Small [Price Changes]

A New York telegram on the 14th: The situation of the pound sterling in the foreign exchange market remains stable. It opened at 4 yuan 03 and a half fen in the morning, and then reached 4 yuan 04 fen. However, the result was no different from the previous day. The closing price was still 4 yuan 03 fen 75.

A Bombay telegram on the 14th: The silver market trend is tired, and the result [illegible] each fell two annas in September, and [illegible] fell a small anna in October. The number of transactions totaled [illegible] five. Also, the British and American silver markets both reported no market.

### Exchange Rates Across Regions

Recently, for remittances to various regions from banks in this city, except for the Bank of China and Bank of Communications remitting to Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces, which, according to the Ministry of Finance's order, are remitted through Chongqing, Kunming, and Guiyang, receiving legal tender. For example, if Shenjiao remits 10,000 yuan, Chongqing receives 10,000 yuan in legal tender, while other banks generally offer around an 80% rate, meaning Shenjiao remits 8,000 yuan in legal tender, and Chongqing receives 10,000 yuan in legal tender. Kunming, Guiyang, and other places are the same as Chongqing. As for commercial firms advertising for remittances with fee subsidies, it is reported that they only subsidize a little over ten yuan per hundred yuan, with a premium smaller than that of ordinary commercial banks. Furthermore, bank remittances are more secure and faster. Remitters should take note.

According to news on exchange rates, most are at par. However, for large sums, a premium of four or five yuan per thousand yuan may be offered. For example, if Shenjiao remits 1,000 yuan in legal tender, Fuzhou may receive 1,005 yuan. Xi'an in Shaanxi is at a 90% rate, meaning Shenjiao remits 90 yuan in legal tender, and Xi'an receives 100 yuan. Remittances to Tianjin and Beijing require Shenjiao to remit 1056 yuan in legal tender and Tianjin receive 100 yuan. Hankou is at par, meaning Shenjiao remits 100 yuan in legal tender, and Hankou receives 100 yuan in legal tender.

### Securities: Waterworks Share Dividend

The British-owned Shanghai Waterworks Company, Limited, recently announced that it would distribute dividends for cast ordinary shares on September 27th, calculating 70% for cumulative redeemable preference shares, and 3.5% for this year's dividend; 6.5% for cumulative redeemable preference shares, and 3.25% for half-year dividend; A, B, and C ordinary shares will each distribute an interim dividend at an annual interest rate of 1%. Within that, A shares will each receive four shillings in English currency, and B and C shares will each receive [blank].

### Sugar Market: Sugar Market Stabilized

Yesterday's market saw little fluctuation. The guild quoted: spot 24 coarse white original at 88 yuan, Dutch red spot at 62 yuan, futures at 61.5 yuan, Taikoo granulated white at 75.5 yuan, DY road goods at 72.5 yuan, HX at 72 yuan. (The previous day's inventory of over ten thousand [units unclear] was corrected to over a thousand [units unclear].)

### North-South Goods: Black Melon Seeds Rebound

Since the opening price of black melon seeds loosened, due to this year's poor harvest, the production price could not be too low, and the source became scarce, so the price rebounded. Recently, Chengzi opened at 82.5 to 83 yuan, and real seeds at 79.5 yuan. Even smaller sizes have risen two or three yuan, it is said.

### Southern Pond Gorgon Fruit Poor Harvest: Production Price Particularly High

Southern pond gorgon fruit is already out of stock. This year's new crop is also a poor harvest, with production prices unusually high, exceeding 300 yuan. It is reported that a few dozen catties have arrived in the Shanghai market, but there is still no formal market to speak of. Pond gorgon fruit sells for 75-6 yuan to 80 yuan, with a relatively stable market trend.

### Medicinal Materials: Gardenia Arrival and Sales Both Scarce

Although small gardenias have not been transported recently, sales from all sides have also been quiet, leading to a downward trend in the market. It is heard that the price has dropped by two or three yuan. Stock levels in the trading houses are scarce, and the market is expected to stabilize in the future.

### Coal: Haifeng White Coal Price Gradually Decreasing

With the recent easing of foreign exchange rates and the unobstructed Vietnam route, the supply of white coal is no longer a problem. Therefore, the black market price has been decreasing. Yesterday, although a certain firm's official quote for Haifeng white coal was still 208 yuan, it could be bought on the inter-market for 190 yuan. Therefore, this office has also appropriately reduced its margin, it is said.

The operating rate of copper plants in the [unclear] secondary district next week is expected to be 89%, up two pounds from the beginning, a new high since last December.

### Grain: American Wheat

Chicago, 14th. Wheat market professionals have differing opinions. On the one hand, wheat is being used for collateral, and on the other hand, there is a huge surplus. As of September 11th, new wheat used for collateral exceeded 12,200,000 bushels.

### Seasonal Fruits for the Mid-Autumn Festival

— Xiao Kangshi

Also a Few Pieces of Refreshing Admonitory Medicine

Every year there is a Mid-Autumn Festival, but only the Mid-Autumn Festivals of these past four years have felt indescribable. Anywhere outside the isolated island must be in a particularly miserable state in tonight's eyes of Chang'e. At the same time, seeing the prosperous islanders still living in their dream, it truly makes her – Chang'e – feel so many emotions!

On the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival, the island residents who are intoxicated in their lives, of course, will make grand displays, eating festival wine, worshiping the moon, playing this extravagant custom, without considering saving some financial resources for the country. Now, just talking about seasonal foods for Mid-Autumn Festival, like mooncakes, lotus roots, pears, persimmons, water chestnuts, and things of that nature, they contain the meaning of cautioning against the general illnesses of people today! They are also a few pieces of refreshing admonitory medicine! So I have to write it down below to tell the readers:

Mooncakes: Mooncakes are cut open to be eaten, symbolizing that if a country were to perish, it would be divided by the strong, just like a mooncake! But the fillings inside the mooncakes are of different kinds and are divided into many kinds of yellow, black, blue, and white colors. Here, it can represent the conscience of modern people, just like mooncakes. Although the outer shells are the same color, their contents must be distinguished by their goodness, badness, black, and white. Therefore, when everyone eats mooncakes, they should also examine themselves and see which color their conscience is similar to in the mooncake fillings – white or black?

Lotus Root: According to medicinal properties, lotus root tastes sweet, is neutral in nature, non-toxic, resolves heat toxins, and does not produce insects when eaten with honey. In this era of ardent and vicious hearts, everyone can eat their fill of lotus root to remove ardent and vicious thoughts.

Pear: Pear tastes sweet, is cold in nature, non-toxic, enters the heart and liver meridians. The heart meridian is prone to guest heat, so people without determination can eat a raw pear to expel guest heat from the heart meridian, to avoid being blinded by profit and falling into a state of confusion, ultimately becoming incurable.

Persimmon: Persimmon tastes sweet and astringent, is cold in nature, non-toxic, and clears the ears and nose. Therefore, people who have lost their hearing can eat persimmons to restore their reason, listen to the cries of the disaster-stricken people in the fields, and smell the fragrance and foulness of people's nature, in order to make standards for closeness and distance.

Water Chestnut: The color of water chestnut, with a red shell and white flesh, indicates that people today should know that, like the composition of water chestnut, the inner heart must be pure white and spotless.

### Red Bean Flower Knitting Method

— Ni Xiuyue

Knit into a short, high-necked, fitted woolen coat that is extremely light, beautiful, and pleasing to the eye.

The early autumn air is sometimes cold, sometimes warm, and woolen coats are the most beloved garment of ladies. Red bean flowers are a beautiful and pleasing pattern. If they are used to knit a short, high-necked, fitted woolen coat, it will be truly light, warm, beautiful, and lovely. It is perfect for wearing in early autumn. Such a coat uses very little material, about seven strands of fine wool are enough. The knitting method is as follows…

First row: Add one stitch, purl one stitch, knit three stitches, cast off one stitch with seven stitches (knit one, purl one, knit one, purl one, knit one, purl one, knit one). Knit three stitches, yarn over one stitch, add one stitch, knit one stitch.

Second row: Knit all stitches, knit seven stitches released in the above row together.

Third row: Knit one stitch, add one stitch, purl one stitch. Knit five stitches, yarn over one stitch, add one stitch, knit two stitches.

Fourth row: Knit all stitches.

Fifth row: Knit one stitch, add one stitch, purl one stitch. Knit one stitch, yarn over one stitch, add one stitch, knit three stitches.

Sixth row: Knit all stitches.

Seventh row: Knit three stitches, add one stitch, purl one stitch. Knit three stitches, yarn over one stitch, add one stitch, knit three stitches.

Eighth row: Knit all stitches.

Ninth row: Knit four stitches, add one stitch. Knit three stitches together, add one stitch, knit five stitches.

Tenth row: Knit all stitches.

This is half of the entire flower. Knit ten rows in the opposite direction to form the entire flower.

### Casual Talk on Mooncakes

— Tu Shouzhuo

The making of mooncakes has a long history. "On the Mid-Autumn Festival night, people place images of the Moon Palace in their homes, with a rabbit standing upright on the symbol. They display melons and fruits in the courtyard, and the cake surface is painted with a Moon Palace toad and rabbit. Men and women respectfully bow and burn incense, and burn it during the day." This shows that mooncakes existed at that time, but the form may be slightly different from today.

When I was a child, tea and snack shops sold assorted meat mooncakes. Each box contained four large ones or eight small ones, and the price was only 160 cash coins. Later, the price rose to 320 coins, and buyers already complained that it was too expensive. Now, each box costs four or five jiao, and the fillings are far less rich than they were then.

Since the popularity of Cantonese-style mooncakes, they have almost taken the place of Suzhou-style mooncakes, but the price is becoming more and more expensive. Yesterday, I saw a giant Cantonese-style mooncake with a diameter of one foot displayed in the window of a large company, priced at 300 yuan in legal tender, which made poor scholars gasp in disbelief.

Cantonese-style mooncakes have a small version that I particularly like to eat. Before the war, each one cost two fen. I often bought one or two boxes to relieve hunger. This year, the price has increased to eight fen per piece, which is in line with the labor price index of 25 cents of legal tender per yuan. In the future, those who want to investigate the prices of goods during the extraordinary period can extrapolate other items from this small mooncake.

Suzhou-style mooncakes are sticky and difficult to digest, which is their weakness. However, the fragrance of the clear water rose filling lingering in the teeth and cheeks, and the coolness of the clear water mint filling permeating the spleen, cannot be matched by Cantonese-style mooncakes. I am a glutton by nature, and I want both fish and bear paws. Unfortunately, I am shy of money and can only talk about cakes to relieve hunger.

After the rose and mint fillings became expensive, I often saw mooncake fillings being made with white sugar, dry flour, and red and green colored water as substitutes. Regardless of losing the "fragrant" and "cool" flavor, just from a hygiene standpoint, eating colored dyes into the stomach is also useless and harmful. Those who want to buy mooncakes should no longer buy these rose and mint fillings that exist in name only.

### A Few Things Before Going to Bed

— Tian Qing

When night comes, I feel like my eyelids weigh a ton, wanting to close, and my limbs are weak and powerless. Once I sit down, I yawn one after another. This is the reaction after a busy day. Only sleep can make up for the body's fatigue. However, a few things before going to bed need special attention because they are closely related to physical health.

Brushing teeth at night before going to bed is the easiest thing to overlook, but it is very important. Because after eating all day, some food particles inevitably remain in the gaps between the teeth. If you don't brush your teeth before going to bed, your mouth will be closed during sleep, and the air will not circulate. As a result, microorganisms will multiply in the residue, causing bad breath and tooth decay. If the teeth are not healthy, it will hinder overall physical health. Therefore, brushing your teeth after eating is a must. But that seems too troublesome, so twice a day, morning and evening, is the minimum limit.

Drinking some plain boiled water after brushing your teeth is also necessary. Because food is chewed in the mouth and enters the esophagus, then the stomach, and finally the intestines, at the same time performing digestion. Food residue is inevitably left on the walls of the stomach and intestines. Therefore, drinking a glass of boiled water before going to bed helps digestion on the one hand and also has the function of washing the walls of the stomach and intestines, so that the residue does not stay in one place, otherwise it will have an adverse effect on the stomach and intestines.

### Economic Dishes for a Week

— Ms. Hua Ying

Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival in the lunar calendar. Wealthy families will have a banquet to enjoy the moon, drinking and feasting freely, not caring at all about spending fifty or one hundred yuan on a feast. But us, economic families, even on festivals, still have to consider economy. Therefore, as usual, I will still match two meat dishes and two vegetarian dishes. One of the meat dishes is braised meatballs with greens, which symbolizes the bright moon tonight, taking on the meaning of reunion. Recently, large cabbages have been available on the market. Although they have not been frosted, the cabbage hearts have a slightly sweet taste. Red braising them with meatballs makes them even more rich and delicious. It is slightly troublesome to make the fish balls yourself, but seeing as it is a festival, it is okay to be a little troublesome. Buy a white fish, scrape off the meat, chop it finely with the back of a knife, add fine salt and cold boiled water, and make it into balls. Put them in warm boiled water and then cook them with vermicelli. If you add small diced water chestnuts while chopping the fish, they will be even more chewy when eaten. Use white soup for the soup, adding a little salt and MSG to enhance the flavor.

### Some Rejoice, Some Grieve

— Yu Fang

Problems Beyond "Moon Viewing"

Living in a hurry, another Mid-Autumn Festival has arrived in the blink of an eye!

"The moon is extraordinarily bright in mid-autumn", this poetic painting will probably evoke a lot of sweet memories in us - everyone eating a reunion dinner, dividing a large mooncake, telling mooncake stories… Although such happy scenes are not lacking on today's isolated island, when everyone looks at the special-made mooncakes with price tags of tens or even hundreds of yuan displayed in those company display cases, imagining the happiness of the customers of these mooncakes, it really far exceeds our sweet dreams of the past. But the majority of the people in the isolated city are still the same; they are still worried about their daily meals, how can they have the "elegant pastime" of "viewing the moon" and "eating cakes"?

"...Some rejoice, some grieve?" I don't know who wrote these "Mid-Autumn Festival" lines of poetry, which precisely describes the lives of the people living in this era.

"Mid-Autumn Festival" is usually a settlement day for us in the business community. People owe me, and I owe others. Most of us have a routine settlement on this day. In the past few years, business has been good, accounts have been good, and all industries have spent this festival in joy. Especially the market situation since the opening of the new year this year, with soaring prices, this atmosphere is quite "prosperous."

Perhaps it is for the reason that "extremes beget reversals", since mid-May, the prices in the isolated city have suddenly shown a stagnant image, followed by things like hardware, yarn flowers, cotton cloth, etc., gradually declining from the high line. Due to the weakening of the consumption power of the general public, the entire market seems to have revealed the symptoms of expansion, indigestion, and unnamed diseases, "It's broken!" we hear someone calling out.

At the same time, many industrial factories are in a state of reduced work, suspension of work, which is the best epitome of the movement of the entire isolated city's business community! Generally speaking, companies and shops, facing this season of summer passing and autumn coming, should have been their thriving business season, but today's bleak and desolate situation has really dampened the hopes of many business people for the economic climate, On the contrary, there are quite a few who are worried and anxious about the stockpiled inventory!

"Opening up sources" and "reducing expenditure" will inevitably be the trend in our business community. As the "economic climate" of the isolated city changes to bleakness, reduced work, suspension of work, and even suspension of salary and layoffs, will inevitably gradually expand in the future! And as the settlement date of this Mid-Autumn Festival, which in the past has often been the season for personnel changes in the business community, we can't bear to imagine how many industrial and commercial colleagues will lose their livelihood - their jobs!

Mending Broken Banknotes

Editor:

Please allow me to borrow a corner of your newspaper to express some opinions.

I am a shop apprentice who graduated from elementary school, so dozens of yuan in banknotes pass through my hands every day. Recently, I have found many broken banknotes, which naturally need to be mended.

To mend banknotes, you need a clean piece of paper that follows the rules. On the contrary, the paper I see used to mend banknotes every day is tattered, such as small pieces of old newspaper, old book paper, etc.,... even tram tickets are used to mend them.

For this reason, our shop has prepared some clean white paper strips, about one-third of an inch wide, to use to carefully mend broken banknotes. I think this is very good. I hope that every shop prepares some paper strips and glue for mending broken banknotes. I also hope that people who use broken paper to mend banknotes will not do so again.

The Hawthorne Case

### The Homecoming of the Dance Queen

Chapter 7 "Take him into custody"

Lu Jiansheng shook his head and said, "No, it wouldn't be that simple. After she explained it to me in the car, I immediately said that I would deal with him, as long as she told me his name, address, and occupation, I would have my ways and she wouldn't have to be afraid. But Lili didn't want to tell me after all, and instead advised me not to make things difficult for this person. She once said to me: 'You don't have to fight with him, it's too meaningless. I'm not afraid of him either, just let him go.' These words were clearly deceiving me, she was really afraid of this person. Because when we arrived at the cinema, she still looked uneasy, looking around from time to time."

Hawthorne said, "Did you see him again in the cinema?"

Lu Jiansheng said, "No, I also looked around, but I couldn't see him. But I believe Lili must have been killed by this Zhao.... Detective Ni, have you found out who this person is?"

Ni Jinzhi replied, "We only know that this person is called Zhao Boxiong--that may be a pseudonym. He originally lived at 774 Yadong Hotel, but he has now moved out. We don't know what his occupation is yet. Mr. Huo has a photo of him in his pocket. Other than that, we don't know anything else."

When Lu Jiansheng's eyes turned towards Hawthorne, Hawthorne had already taken out the small photo from his chest pocket. Lu Jiansheng quickly stood up to receive the photo.

He nodded repeatedly and said, "It's him, you can all see, he can't be said to be handsome."

He turned the photo over to look at it, and said in surprise, "Ah, these five words, 'Yadong 774', written in pencil, are Lili's handwriting."

Hawthorne still took the photo back, nodded and said, "Yes, please sit down. I have more questions to ask you. Did you use your car to pick up Wang Lili last night?"

Lu Jiansheng sat down again and replied, "Yes, it was about 6:30. We first took a tour around the Xianggong Ballroom, and then went to the Baimei Restaurant for supper." (108)
