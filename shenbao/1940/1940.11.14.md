### National Father's Birthday – Chairman Lin's Speech

Chongqing – At the memorial service held by the central authorities to commemorate the National Father's birthday, Chairman Lin reported on "The Significance of Commemorating the National Father's Birthday," stating, in brief: "Ladies and gentlemen, today is the birthday of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the National Father of our party, the Kuomintang, and the Republic of China. As we hold this meeting to commemorate the birthday of the National Father who created the Republic of China on this day, which marks the fourth year of the Sino-Japanese War, we feel a particularly great and profound significance."

"First, we must deepen our understanding of the spirit of revolution led by the National Father. The National Father lived during the autocratic era of the Qing Dynasty. At that time, political corruption reached its extreme. Domestically, after the oppression of the Qing Dynasty and the Taiping Rebellion, the nation's strength was depleted, the people suffered, and the officialdom was so corrupt that it could not be revived. Externally, it suffered from incessant aggression by the great powers, signing many treaties that ceded sovereignty and humiliated the country, placing the nation in a semi-colonial position. Seeing this situation, the National Father felt that without launching a revolution to overthrow autocracy and establish a republic, the country had no hope of reform. Therefore, from his childhood studies, he resolved to study the principles of governing the country and bringing peace to the world, both ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign. He finally created the epoch-making Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution, embraced a spirit of great fearlessness, cried out loudly, traveled at home and abroad, successively organized the Revive China Society and the Revolutionary Alliance, and finally organized the Kuomintang, calling on comrades and awakening compatriots across the country to unite and fight together. The National Father resolved to make a revolution, create revolutionary doctrines, and he himself not only spoke but also acted. He acted and failed, but he was not discouraged or depressed. Instead, the more he failed, the more he fought. No matter how difficult the environment, he always persevered and made persistent efforts, leading his comrades to advance bravely. This noble and great spirit of revolutionary leadership should be cherished by us. This is the first point that we should bring to everyone's attention today as we commemorate the National Father's birthday."

"Second, the National Father advocated the National Revolution with the aim of achieving China's independence, freedom, and equality. The explanation of independence, freedom, and equality is to seek self-preservation internally and co-existence externally. If we do not achieve this goal one day, we cannot stop our efforts towards revolution for one day. We recognize that Japan is a strong country in East Asia and geographically closest to us China. It should have the clearest understanding of our revolutionary goals and should come forward to help us. However, the reality is the opposite. Japan has never wanted an independent, free, and prosperous China to coexist and prosper with it. It not only does not help our revolution but also conspires to undermine our revolution and even directly uses force to attack our revolution. There are countless such facts. Everyone must know it clearly, so there is no need to say more today. But can our revolutionary action be terminated because of Japan's jealousy, sabotage, and attacks? Every true descendant of the Yellow Emperor and disciple of the National Father will never tolerate this humiliation. Since the creation of the 'September 18th' and 'July 7th' incidents, Japan's consistent ambition to invade China by force has been fully exposed. If we do not rise up to defend ourselves, then the goal of the National Revolution that the National Father showed us will never be realized. This is the second point that we should bring to everyone's attention today as we commemorate the National Father's birthday."

"Third, we must defend the national policy and strive for final victory. It is our supreme national policy today. Since the Provisional National Congress of our Party decided on this policy two years ago, the people of the whole country have already recognized and supported it unanimously. Unexpectedly, later, a small number of people lost their stand on the revolution and misinterpreted the National Father's words on Pan-Asianism, righteousness, peace, struggle, and saving China, using them as amulets. They do not know that the Pan-Asianism advocated by the National Father is planar, not three-dimensional. All Asian countries should be treated equally, respect each other, and never have the inferior thought of relying on others and being a vassal. As for peace, struggle, and saving China, it means that peace does not forget struggle. Only peace achieved through struggle is the peace of independence, freedom, and equality. They forget struggle and only seek peace. The kind of peace obtained without one's own strength must be a peace of submission, a peace of slavery. Where is true peace? Now, because Japan has invaded China by force and fought for more than three years, the war has no solution. It is fantasizing and fabricating various rumors of peace to shake our people's hearts. How can it know that our national policy has long been decided? The Japanese people's rumors have been broken by our iron-like facts. This is the third point that we should bring to everyone's attention today as we commemorate the National Father's birthday."

"In short, the leader of our party is the National Father who created the Republic of China. Only with the leader, then there is our party. Only with our party, then there is the National Revolution. Only with the National Revolution, then there is the Republic of China that struggles for survival. Only with the Republic of China that struggles for survival, then there is the long-term war of aggression against Japan. Today, we are celebrating the National Father's birthday, at a time when the Sino-Japanese War has entered its fourth year and victory is gradually approaching. The strength of the Japanese is being consumed day by day. As long as we follow the revolutionary spirit shown to us by the National Father, muster up the courage to advance bravely, and strive for final victory." (12th Dispatch)

### Japan's New Posture in its Diplomacy with the United States

Coincidentally with Molotov's invitation to Germany, Japan's diplomacy with the United States has also begun to take on a new and active approach. Starting with a two-hour meeting on the 10th of this month between Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka and US Ambassador Grew. The content is said to be a review of the details of US-Japan relations, followed immediately by the appointment of General Nomura as the successor to Ambassador Horinouchi to the United States. At the same time, there are rumors that the Japanese side will be led by Foreign Minister Matsuoka to visit the United States with a delegation on a goodwill mission. Although the possibility of this rumor being realized is extremely small, it is sufficient to show the Japanese side's eagerness to improve US-Japan relations. The international situation, which was slightly clarified by the Tripartite Alliance, has once again fallen into confusion due to the new form of existence between the Soviet Union and Germany. This movement in Japan's diplomacy with the United States undoubtedly adds even more clouds, fog, complexity and confusion.

According to unconfirmed reports yesterday: Negotiations on the Soviet-Japanese non-aggression pact seem to be approaching. No matter how much the Soviet Union does not change its position on the Far East and aid to China, the rapprochement between the Soviet Union and Germany will inevitably reduce the distance between the Soviet Union and Japan. Japan's closeness to the Soviet Union is intended to facilitate its southward advance and to confront the United Kingdom and the United States. According to common sense, it seems that now is the time for Japan to become tougher on the United States. Examining Japanese public opinion after Roosevelt was elected for the third time, almost everyone believes that the path to US-Japan rapprochement has been blocked. However, the recent diplomatic maneuvers by the Japanese authorities are not only beyond the expectations of the world but also quite different from the general views of the Japanese. The message here is worthy of serious attention.

Before the facts on all sides are fully clarified, it is advisable to give perspective from different angles. First, the signing of the Tripartite Alliance originally violated the wishes of most Japanese public opinion. If it can truly achieve the effect of deterring the United Kingdom and the United States and strengthening its own position, then the resentment in public opinion may gradually dissipate into nothing. However, for more than a month, it has only invited pressure from the United Kingdom and the United States, further exacerbating the inability of Japan's rights and obligations to offset each other. Moreover, the military and political situation in Germany and Italy has deteriorated with each passing day, leaving them in a state of advancement and retreat. Japan, which originally intended to benefit itself, cannot but seek another path to find a way out. This kind of intention was already sprouting when the United States' tough attitude towards Japan was first revealed, and now it has evolved into practical measures. Second, Japan's southward advance has indeed become like an arrow on a string. However, with the complexity of the political situation in South Asia, the weakness of military preparations, and the lack of a collective defense system, the path to economic seizure and victory without fighting has not been completely blocked. However, it is necessary to take advantage of the relaxation of attention of the United Kingdom and the United States and the fact that its relationship with Japan is not yet completely rigid, as it did previously in northern Vietnam. For this purpose, Japan must continue to seek reconciliation and deception with the United Kingdom and the United States - especially with the United States. Third, the situation in the European war is now on the eve of rapid development. It is still difficult to determine immediately whether it will be beneficial or harmful to Japan. Therefore, the Japanese side still needs to wait and see for a while for a favorable opportunity to come. Therefore, it cannot but temporarily seek to reduce the heavy pressure from the United States, which has been increasing. Fourth, although the rapprochement between the Soviet Union and Germany is sufficient to promote the progress of Soviet-Japanese negotiations, on the other hand, it will inevitably promote the deterioration of relations between the United Kingdom and the United States and arouse the revival of anti-Soviet sentiment among the upper echelons of the United Kingdom and the United States. This is indeed another opportunity for Japan to ease relations with the United Kingdom and the United States. The Japanese side cannot but imagine taking advantage of this opportunity to reap the benefits of sitting on the fence. Fifth, for economic reasons, Japan cannot completely get rid of its dependence on the United Kingdom and the United States before its so-called East Asian economic group plan has achieved tangible results. The stagnation of its foreign trade, the deterioration of its international balance of payments, the panic of various resources, and the radical nature of inflation have all forced the Japanese authorities to temporarily seek a turnaround in relations with the United States to save its economic crisis. Sixth, Japan's response to the Western powers has always been to divide the United Kingdom and the United States as its main strategy. At present, it is not permissible for Japan's strength to be at odds with both the United Kingdom and the United States. If it is possible to reduce the antipathy of the United States, then the United Kingdom's inability to cope with the European situation should not constitute a major problem for the Japanese side. In short, the main motives behind Japan's recent diplomatic gestures towards the United States are probably nothing more than the above speculations. Therefore, this is not Matsuoka's own self-contempt, going back on his previous remarks about abolishing flattery diplomacy, but rather is limited by the various practical difficulties at present and cannot but take a roundabout route to cope. Inside this conciliatory cloak, it is still the same old face. This is also not a failure of Japanese radicalism, because its intention is ultimately to facilitate the success of the radical agenda. Although there is a considerable rift between Konoe and the military, and Matsuoka's diplomatic views are not entirely consistent with those of Toshio Shiratori, it is absolutely impossible to imagine that they have reached the point of knowing the way back or fundamentally repenting under the current political situation in Japan.

However, this kind of operation is at most a repetition of the old tune that Abe Ugaki has already failed. A year or two ago, it was still sufficient to achieve practical results, let alone today. The Japanese side's posture is mainly aimed at the current chaotic international situation and its own weakness that its preparations have not been completed. It may be that there will be changes soon. The future of the European situation is indeed worrisome. However, it is expected that the Soviet Union will not greatly change its neutral position and be excessively biased, and the Pacific problem, as pointed out in yesterday's editorial in this newspaper, is not something that the Soviet Union and Germany can control. Furthermore, Japan's current operations are entirely for its own sake. As far as the obligations of the Tripartite Alliance are concerned, they are clearly not welcomed by Germany and Italy. On the other hand, the United States' Far East policy and China's firm resistance war will never be shaken by the complex trends in the international community and Japan's unilateral wishes. This can be asserted.

### Hull Meets with Secretaries of War and Navy to Strengthen the Strength of the Philippines; US-UK-Australia Pacific Joint Defense Issue to Continue Negotiations After Lothian Returns to the United States

Washington – As it is gradually becoming apparent here that the United States is about to increase its naval and military strength in the Philippines, according to news last night, talks between the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia on Pacific joint defense will soon resume. Australian Minister to Washington Casey announced last night that talks between the United Kingdom, the United States, and Australia on Pacific defense could resume soon after British Ambassador Lothian returned to Washington from London. Casey made the announcement after meeting with Secretary of State Hull again yesterday. Casey said that the issue of the South Pacific would be given special consideration after Lord Lothian returned to Washington. The Secretaries of War and Navy yesterday met with Hull for more than two hours to discuss the possibilities and consequences of effectively increasing the United States' defense strength in the Philippines. Secretary of War Stimson and Secretary of the Navy Knox refused to comment on the content of their meeting with Hull. They both said that the content of the talks should be announced by Hull. Sources said that the decision involved a plan to enhance the United States' defenses in the Pacific. News here for some time has indicated that the government is considering strengthening the United States' naval and military strength in the Philippine Islands. Observers recalled last night that Knox told reporters when announcing the Navy Department's recent purchase of several oil tankers and other auxiliary ships, saying that these ships were for the exclusive use of the US fleet. He said that the ships would be moved by the US fleet in "any part of the Pacific." (13th Associated Press Dispatch)

### Three States in Eastern America: Pharmaceutical Factory Explosions; Federal Bureau Commences Extensive Investigation; Evidence Points to Strong Possibility of Strikes

Washington – The Federal Bureau of Investigation last night commenced an extensive investigation into the explosions resulting in multiple deaths and injuries in the three eastern states. The fact that two of the explosions occurred in factories filling national defense orders strongly suggests a strong possibility of strikes. According to a statement by Mr. Dai, chairman of the Non-American Activities Committee, he received a phone call from Washington reporting that ten instances of strike activity had already occurred, a rate possibly related to the recent explosions. However, he declined to elaborate further or disclose the locations of the strikes. (United Press, 13th)

Woodbridge, New Jersey, USA – A munitions factory in New Jersey suffered repeated explosions yesterday, causing millions in damages.

### Southern Ireland Rejects Cooperation with Britain; Canada to Intervene; Lease Naval and Air Force Ports

Ottawa – Conservative Party leader of the Canadian House of Commons, Mr. Hanson, spoke yesterday about the Southern Irish government’s refusal to allow Britain to use its naval bases and air force ports, stating that the Canadian government should make a private request to Southern Irish Prime Minister de Valera to lease the two ports on Southern Ireland’s west coast to Canada as its naval stations during wartime. Southern Ireland’s refusal to allow Britain to use its ports is one of the greatest dangers to the British war effort and a valuable contribution to the Axis powers. The Southern Irish government is clearly unwilling to change its policy of non-cooperation with Britain merely at the request of the British government. This situation must be addressed. Canada should intervene with Southern Ireland, not only to lease its two ports on the west coast but also to lease its southwestern air force ports as Canadian air force stations. Canada might seek assistance from the United States in this matter, as many Americans are quite supportive of Southern Ireland’s freedom. (Reuters, 13th)

Ottawa – The situation of Canadian citizens is quite similar to that of the United States, as the population of Canada is composed of people of various nationalities. Although Canada is home to people of various nationalities, the main cultural division is between French Canadians and British Canadians. One notable characteristic is that French Canadians do not have a particular allegiance to France. In fact, these French Canadians tend to downplay French liberalism in politics, religion, and the arts. They are not concerned about France’s failures, but are worried about the impact of France’s failures on Britain. Currently, both British and French Canadians are working towards national unity. (Associated Press, 13th)

### National Foreign Trade Deficit Exceeds 100 Million Yuan This Year; Free Areas Have Trade Surplus of Over 80 Million Yuan; Deficit Caused by Excessive Imports into Occupied Areas

Chongqing – According to an announcement by the authorities, from January 1 to September 30 of this year, the total value of exports from the Chinese free areas was 120,529,000 yuan, and the total value of imports was 35,292,000 yuan, resulting in a surplus of 85,247,000 yuan. During the closure of the Yunnan-Burma Road, exports continued as usual, while imports will only resume after the road reopens. This is one of the reasons for the surplus. During this period, the total value of imports in trade between the free areas and the occupied areas was 1,558,606,000 yuan, and exports were 1,447,521,000 yuan, resulting in a deficit of 111,085,000 yuan. In terms of total trade volume, Shanghai ranks first, with imports of 615,197,000 yuan and exports of 984,192,000 yuan. Tianjin is second, with imports of 490,279,000 yuan and exports of 105,391,000 yuan. In terms of the origin of imports, Japanese goods rank first, totaling 336,840,000 yuan, accounting for 23.54% of total imports. However, the sales locations for these imported Japanese goods are limited to the occupied areas. The United States ranks second, totaling 334,189,000 yuan, accounting for 21.44% of total imports. In terms of Chinese goods exported to various countries, the United States ranks first, totaling 414,404,000 yuan, accounting for 28.63% of total Chinese exports. This is up from only 122,666,000 yuan during the same period last year. Chinese goods exported through Hong Kong totaled 287,508,000 yuan. In addition, trade is developing rapidly in Mengzi in Yunnan and Ningbo in Zhejiang. (Havas, 10th)

### Actual Direct Tax Revenue Exceeds Budget

Chongqing – According to an announcement by the authorities, the original budget for direct taxes for the entire year was 75,240,000 yuan, but by the end of October, it had already reached 76,402,857.84 yuan. It is estimated that the total tax revenue for the end of the year will be between 85,000,000 yuan and 100,000,000 yuan. The main reason is the prosperity of businesses and the expansion of tax areas. (Havas, 13th)

London – According to the Soir newspaper, the most notable aspect of the talks that have begun between the Soviet Union and Germany will be shrewd bargaining. Currently, it has only been announced that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov held two and a half hours of talks with Hitler yesterday, and nothing has been mentioned about what was discussed. (Reuters, 13th)

Berlin – After completing his talks with Hitler, Soviet Foreign Affairs Commissar Molotov returned to the German government's guest house, the "Bellevue Hotel." At 7:00 PM, the German government hosted a banquet at the "Kaiserhof Hotel" to welcome Molotov and his entourage. (Haitong News, 13th)

Berlin – The contents of the two and a half hour meeting between Soviet Foreign Affairs Commissar Molotov and Hitler yesterday remain shrouded in secrecy. Neither the German officialdom nor the government-controlled press have announced any details or expressed any opinions. Some believe that the subject of yesterday's and today's continued negotiations involves dividing the spheres of influence among Germany, Italy, the Soviet Union, Japan, and Spain. The outline of this division was previously roughly defined in the alliance of the three countries of Germany, Italy, and Japan. German officials stated today that all parties concerned believe that it is imperative to clearly delineate their relationships with each other, and this is what the current negotiations are seeking. Therefore, the issues discussed at the meeting not only include Europe but also Asia and Africa, and their nature is said to be largely political rather than economic. (Associated Press, 13th)

German Foreign Ministry Issues Statement Explaining Purpose of German-Soviet Talks

London – According to French radio, the German Foreign Ministry sent an official statement to journalists yesterday, stating that Soviet Foreign Commissar Molotov's visit to Berlin is the logical result of the development of the European situation and the signing of the Tripartite Pact. The development of the war and the German-Italian-Japanese alliance have created a new situation, and it is necessary to clearly define the Soviet Union's position. Molotov's visit has two purposes: (1) to determine the basis for political and economic coordination between the Soviet Union and the Axis powers and in the future with Japan; (2) to reconsider the basis of the German-Soviet agreement from the perspective of broader coordination. In the current environment, Mr. Molotov's visit is meaningful because it proves that the development of Europe and the signing of the Tripartite Pact have not affected the complete realization of the common interests of both the United States and Germany. Since the establishment of the German-Soviet agreement, coordination between the two sides has become increasingly close and has never faltered, contrary to foreign propaganda. The talks are not an end in themselves, but an important stage in a completely and permanently coordinated relationship between the two countries. French radio continued that after Molotov returns to his country, major talks will be held in Moscow to continue the discussions in Berlin. Moscow political circles say that after Molotov reports the situation to Stalin, he will discuss everything with the Japanese and German ambassadors to the Soviet Union, and major contacts will also be made with the representatives of Italy and Turkey in the Soviet Union. (Reuters, 13th)

Rumor That Germany and the Soviet Union Are Preparing a Plan to Put Pressure on Turkey

London – According to political observers here, the main reason why the Soviet Union sent Foreign Commissar Molotov with a mission to Berlin is that the Soviet Union is apprehensive of Germany and fears that it will not get a share of the spoils when the Balkans are divided. One of the results that may be obtained from Molotov's discussions in Germany is the formulation of a plan to increase pressure on Turkey and force Turkey to make concessions to Germany. After Molotov arrived in Berlin yesterday, Hitler immediately received him and held discussions for two hours, with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop also present. However, the nature of the talks has not yet been disclosed. (Reuters, 13th)

Budapest – It is widely rumored in diplomatic circles here in Hungary that Germany and the Soviet Union are negotiating a plan to jointly launch a blitzkrieg against Turkey. Rumor has it that the result of the meeting between Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and Hitler in Berlin is that the two sides agreed that the Soviet Union would demand two locations from Turkey: the Turkish border in the Kars region and a fleet base in the Dardanelles. (International News Service, 13th)

Berlin Creates Ominous Facts; Londoners Feel Extremely Uneasy

London – People here in London today are deeply uneasy about the talks between Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and German leader Hitler and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. British politicians, who previously recognized German-Soviet intimacy as another pose, now share the same view as the majority and recognize that Germany and the Soviet Union are once again creating ominous historical facts. People here are worried that the results of the German-Soviet talks may lead to the following facts: (1) The non-belligerent Soviet Union may become closer to Germany, Italy, and Japan; (2) Contrary to the current Axis concept, the Soviet Union may partially abandon China and conclude a pact with Japan; (3) The fate of Turkey and the Dardanelles is about to enter a critical stage. British people are also increasingly worried about the lack of accurate information regarding the results of Molotov's talks. According to political circles here, British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Cripps went to the Soviet Foreign Ministry on Monday to inquire about the meaning of Molotov's trip to Germany, but Soviet Deputy Foreign Commissar Vishinsky consistently refused to tell him. (Associated Press, 13th)

The Soviet Union Will Not Get Involved in the War; The Axis Powers' Plans Will Ultimately Fail

London – Criticism of Molotov's visit to Berlin has been issued under the authorization of the Axis powers, especially from Rome. All of them express the extravagant hope that this discussion will allow the Soviet Union to expand its power to influence Turkish policy to benefit the Axis powers' plans. Observers in London believe that there is no good reason for the Soviet Union's recent policies to make this hope come true. The leaders of the Red Army recently reiterated Stalin's intention during a major review to uphold the policy of ensuring that the Soviet people do not participate in the war. As for the Turkish government's attitude, the Turkish newspaper "Hakimiyet" has published detailed comments on British-Turkish friendship in the past few days, which British people find very satisfactory. The newspaper said that the world may find it strange that the two countries that opposed each other in the last war now have a deep and sincere friendship. The reason is very simple: Turkey's only wish is to develop its own resources within its own territory, and Britain also wants all countries to develop their resources peacefully. Britain's belief in this concept can be proven by its emphasis on the League of Nations. Britain's repeated tolerance of Hitler's insatiable demands for the sake of European peace is another proof of Britain's belief in this concept. Britain firmly recognizes that individual freedom, honor, and democracy are the only way to progress and civilization. The Turkish way of thinking has been adopted by Turkey, so the two countries share the same ideas and principles. British friendship is stronger than any combination of Nazis and Fascists, unlike Nazism and Fascism, which are only combined to divide Europe. (Reuters, 13th)

Japan Hopes Germany Will Act as a Mediator to Promote Rapprochement Between the Soviet Union and Japan

Tokyo – According to semi-official Japanese sources, the Japanese newspaper "Miyako Shimbun" commented on Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's visit to Berlin, saying that it is time for Japan and the Soviet Union to "adjust their mutual relations to achieve the greater goal of a new world order." It is expected that the result of Molotov's trip will be the stabilization of Soviet-German relations, and will also have a good psychological impact on "the rapid realization of Soviet-Japanese rapprochement." (Reuters, 13th)

Moscow – Since the announcement here that the Japanese diplomatic envoy to Moscow, Mr. Nishi, had accompanied Molotov to Berlin, the rumor that the Soviet Union and Japan would sign a non-aggression pact in Berlin has gradually gained momentum today. Although the authorities in Berlin and here continue to maintain silence, some parties believe that things are moving in this direction. People here recall that in September of this year, the Axis powers kept their alliance with Japan a secret, so it is possible that Germany will once again drop another bombshell on the political world and suddenly announce the rapprochement between Moscow and Tokyo. Observers also believe that the secret agreement of the German-Italian-Japanese alliance is said to have stipulated that Germany should do its best to bring the Soviet Union and Japan closer together. If these ten results can be promoted with all efforts, then Germany will definitely be willing to participate. In addition, some parties also believe that the two-hour talk between U.S. Ambassador to Japan Grew and Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke on Sunday is very important, as Grew also visited the Japanese Foreign Minister for a meeting of the same nature before Japan joined the Axis alliance in mid-September.

### Concentration of Italian Forces, Preparing for a Counterattack Against Greek Troops, Fierce Battles in Progress Around Korçë, Italian Aircraft and Artillery Bombard Greek Positions Fiercely

Athens, last night, Italy rushed reinforcements to the Korçë area for a large-scale counterattack, intending to halt the rapid advances of the Greek troops on all fronts. According to the London Daily Express correspondent in Athens, the Italian commander added elite reinforcements and dive bombers to the battle, aiming to break through the Greek positions at all costs. Fierce battles are now underway around Korçë. Yesterday, Italian heavy artillery bombarded Greek positions all day in preparation for a large-scale offensive. It is expected that the Italian offensive may begin within a day or two. Although the Italian artillery continuously bombarded and the air force repeatedly attacked, the initiative seemed to remain with the Greek troops. The British Air Force has provided substantial assistance to the Greek troops. It is reported that British bombers again raided Italian bases yesterday. It is learned that the Italian troops tasted their own artillery fire for the first time yesterday, as the Greek troops used a large number of captured weapons to attack the Italian troops. While the Greek troops pursued the Italian troops in the deep valleys of the central Pindus Mountains, they used the captured light artillery and machine guns to bombard them. It is generally believed that the new offensive of the concentrated Italian forces has been ordered by General Soddu, the Italian Army Chief and Commander-in-Chief of the Italian forces attacking Greece, and has already been implemented. (International News Agency, 13th)

Belgrade, according to news from near the Greek border in southern countries, the concentration of Italian troops in northern Greece has not yet been completed. Italian motorized units are arriving from southern Albania, indicating that the large-scale Italian offensive will not begin for several days. The current fighting is only its prelude. (Haitong News Agency, 13th)

Athens, recent war reports from the Greek front stated that reinforcements of Italian shock troops launched fierce attacks in the area north of Korçë, fighting desperately to prevent the Greek advance. However, the Greek side is determined to advance along the entire front according to the original plan. Italian dive bombers fiercely attacked Greek positions yesterday, which is believed to be a prelude. Within a day or two, Italian forces in various areas are expected to launch larger offensives. The Greek High Command announced today that British and Greek aircraft again attacked Italian bases in Albania, including Korçë, Elbasan, and Vlorë. According to frontline reports, large numbers of Italian reinforcements have arrived in Sandi and Nérantza, apparently preparing for a new offensive. These reinforcements are believed to be natives of the Alps. (International News Agency, 13th)

Rome, this afternoon's Italian military report stated that there were only reconnaissance activities and artillery duels in the Korçë area. The enemy's attempt to attack our army's positions in Epirus was unsuccessful. Our army bombed enemy positions in Pindus, Kalpaki, and Filiates. (Haitong News Agency, 13th)

Greek Warriors Capture Gangani with Heroic Vigor Like Stroke Victims

Ohrid, according to unconfirmed reports from the border, Greek warriors, heroic and vigorous like stroke victims, completely defeated the Italian counterattack on the right wing of Korçë yesterday. The Italian force, one division strong, is now retreating towards the Albanian border. In this battle, the Italian side suffered 12 officers and 630 soldiers killed. The Italian troops abandoned a large amount of baggage during their retreat. According to another report, the Greek troops in the battle zone along the Bikrista-Korçë highway captured Gangani yesterday. The Italian troops retreated to Poliana, eight kilometers from Korçë. In the battle of Gangani, the Greek army suffered 26 deaths and 70 injuries, and captured 7 officers and 140 soldiers. (United Press, 13th)

Italian Troops in the Pindus Mountain Pocket Retreat in Utter Confusion

Athens, the Reuters correspondent with the Greek forces reports that British bomber squadrons again bombed targets within Albania yesterday. Albanian ports used by the Italian army as supply bases were also bombed, but the results are not yet known. The large amount of war equipment abandoned by the Italian army in the gorges of central Epirus is still being collected by the Greek forces. Military circles here believe that the rout of four to five thousand Italian troops in the Pindus pocket area is a major Greek victory. These Italian soldiers abandoned their weapons while fleeing, exhausted and hungry, in utter confusion. The Greek forces also bombed and destroyed mountain rocks at high altitudes in the gorges, and the falling rocks severely struck the fleeing Italian soldiers. Their panicked and confused state will greatly shake the morale of the Italian reinforcements. Furthermore, hundreds of Italian soldiers' corpses are floating in the Shushica River, drifting from the Pindus Mountains into the Albanian watershed, increasing the terror of the Italian reinforcements, who may not have the courage to attack the stronger Greek defenses than before.

Greek Prime Minister Announces Completion of Mobilization, British Air Force Attacks Albanian Seaport

Athens, a British Air Force communiqué recently stated that a squadron of British bombers completely destroyed the important Albanian seaport and fuel depot in Durrës on Monday night and Tuesday morning. Three large fires broke out after the docks were bombed. Subsequently, the fires spread, and the three large fires merged into one. The British airmen, while flying back, could still see the blazing fire from a distance of one hundred miles. According to the British airman leading the bombing of Durrës, speaking to a United Press reporter, this was the best result of the squadron's air raids since the beginning of the war. The fuel depot was destroyed first, and then the entire city and port were engulfed in flames due to the bombing. The airman continued, "I started the operation after the fire broke out, first dropping the first bomb on the burning area, and then dropping the remaining bombs to complete the destruction. I also dropped several bombs on the prosperous port area, and the losses and chaos must have been enormous. "The British Air Force communiqué also stated that another squadron of aircraft also raided an ammunition depot in Vlorë, Albania, at night. The docks of Vlorë were attacked repeatedly yesterday, and large bombs were dropped on the center of the docks and large buildings. Vlorë fired fierce anti-aircraft fire, but it was ineffective. All British aircraft returned safely. (United Press, 13th)

### A Painful History of War (3): Three Tragic Protagonists in the French Tragedy (1): Édouard Daladier, Strong in Appearance but Weak Inside

Jules Romains, a first-class French writer, is well-known and associates with many high-ranking officials. Before this European war broke out, he was commissioned by the authorities to travel to various countries to conduct secret diplomatic activities, intending to prevent the war from taking shape. Unfortunately, his efforts were unsuccessful, and he returned empty-handed. Witnessing the fall of his homeland and the turmoil of the world, he went to the United States, unable to bear the feeling of melancholy. He then wrote about his past visits to the heads of state in various European countries, each with a different face, many of which are unimaginable to outsiders. His collection is rich, and his writing is tortuous, making it an invaluable and important historical anecdote of modern history. Regarding the French part, there are personality analyses of former Prime Minister Daladier and Allied Commander-in-Chief General Gamelin, which are both laughable and tearful. The translations are as follows:

Jules Romains' acquaintance with Daladier dates back to the spring of 1926. At that time, Jules Romains' play about a dictator was being previewed at the Comédie-Française and was well received by the audience. Daladier was one of them and strongly guaranteed that if there were any repercussions when the play was performed publicly, he alone would be willing to take all responsibility. At that time, France was in a "time of peace," and people from top to bottom were happy and comfortable. Many of the ruling elders and members of Congress in the French government were involved in affairs with actresses and young women. Daladier was the Minister of Education at the time. On the day he summoned Jules Romains for a conversation, when discussing such scandalous affairs, Daladier said with a smile, "To be honest, I have never had any dealings with the young women in the theater. As Minister of Education, I can proudly say that I am innocent."

Jules Romains' impression of Daladier can be seen in the following words: "Afterwards, I thought, this is really the person we need. Soon, I thought again, maybe he is the one we are hoping for, the one we absolutely cannot do without. I must keep a close watch on him."

A few months later, Daladier was elected as the president of the Radical-Socialist Party. In the following years, he repeatedly held important positions, held great power, and was highly expected by all sides. Who knew that after the riots in Paris on February 6, 1934, he could not withstand some minor disturbances and dissolved the cabinet the next day? That night, there was a great commotion in Paris. Vehicles were blocked, shops were robbed, and the police turned a blind eye. The workers were full of anger and shouted, "Sentence the chief culprit Daladier to the extreme penalty!" Daladier's indecisive shortcomings were fully exposed at this point.

Two years later, in May 1936, the Popular Front cabinet was established, and Daladier was also elected as one of the leaders. Although his position was not very important, he gradually regained the power he had lost. During this period, Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy gradually colluded, and the situation in Europe became darker day by day. Daladier took office as Minister of War at this time. This gave Daladier another opportunity to act. All parties hoped that he could proceed step by step, reorganize the military, and train the troops well, first and foremost not being used by the warlords. Everyone believed that he would be able to achieve great things this time and not repeat the mistakes of February 6th.

The mysterious color of Daladier, as conveyed in Jules Romains' writing, is now revealed before us. He said:

In April 1938, Daladier served as Prime Minister and Minister of War. Bonnet succeeded Delbos as Minister of Foreign Affairs. I (the author refers to himself, the same below) often interacted with Bonnet, just like before with Delbos, and it was nothing more than wanting to find a way to peace and prevent the outbreak of war. At that time, I traveled around Europe, visiting fourteen countries, motivated by the desire to secretly consult with important figures in various European countries, such as politicians, dignitaries, and social leaders, to unite several free countries or partially unsuppressed countries to jointly maintain European peace.

When I talked to Bonnet, I often asked him, "Did you tell Daladier about my actions? What is his opinion?" At that time, many French people did not understand Bonnet very well, but I always felt that he was worthy of praise. My conversations with him were not superficial, and there were always results after each conversation. Generally speaking, although I did not encourage him to tell Daladier what we talked about, I knew for sure that Bonnet told him what we talked about at any time.

One day in early November of that year, Bonnet came to me with a worried face and said, "The Prime Minister is in an unusually bad mood." This was just a month after the Munich Conference. When Daladier had just returned from Munich, he felt that he had done his best, but he always felt uneasy in his heart. He thought that when he returned to Paris, he would inevitably be ridiculed by the citizens, but unexpectedly, they gave him a very warm welcome. Soon, everyone's opinion changed, and they suspected that Daladier had inevitably sold out completely in Munich. When Hitler gave a speech in Saarbrücken, everyone felt like they had been splashed with a bucket of water. Conspirators were eyeing the opportunity and moving. The Communists received orders from Moscow to disrupt the cabinet led by Daladier and Bonnet, thinking it was a punishment for the failure of Munich. They started very cleverly and maliciously, stirring up trouble among the working class. (Until a year later, when the war broke out, there was still unrest among the workers.)

Bonnet continued, "Yes, Daladier is very clear about it. He feels that there are people around him who want to harm him, but he doesn't know that he actually holds a pivotal position among the key figures in the center. As long as he can cheer up a little, he can sweep away the conspirators and silence the Communists. Unfortunately, he is somewhat like an Adou who cannot be helped up. If he falls again, everything will be lost."

At that time, the French had long forgotten his overthrow on February 7, 1934. Everyone was now placing great hope on him, thinking that in the critical moment of France's survival, he would be a true hero in political history, or at least, the times would create a hero, and he was the only one who could do it.

If Daladier was uneasy in his position at this time, there would be turmoil on the political stage, and there would also be chaos in the streets and factories. Once the seeds of disaster were sown, external problems would follow in a few weeks.

Bonnet said to me, "Please, you must visit Daladier and have a long talk with him. The words we have spoken to him to support him have had little effect so far. We can only rely on your great strength to encourage him and help him to stabilize his mind. Please go quickly."

I considered it again and again, and remembered the small note I sent him on the evening of January 6 (On February 6, 1934, riots broke out in Paris, and that night the author wrote a note to Daladier, urging him to persevere to the end and not give in easily. But the result was the opposite, and Daladier ended up leaving the cabinet), and couldn't help but laugh. But I still replied to Bonnet, "Okay, it doesn't hurt to try, but I can't guarantee that it will be effective after the conversation. You still need to assist from the side. I'll write him a sincere letter first, and leave the visit for after the letter. I hope that this letter will be effective immediately, and after another conversation, things should go smoothly."

Bonnet said, "That's a good idea. Please write the letter quickly, and I will take it myself, so that it will not be seen by others."

We then thought about the people around Daladier, and felt that they were not impossible to work with, but it was a pity that Daladier was surrounded by them, as if he was cut off from the world.

On November 4th, I gave Bonnet a letter, which he immediately delivered to Daladier. The letter was worded as follows:

"Dear Prime Minister, I humbly present this letter in the spirit of saying everything I know and saying it all, as a humble offering. I earnestly hope that you will deeply consider the two aspects of responsibility and power at this time. Within a few days, you can still save France and the current government from danger. Otherwise, the final fate is at hand, and I need not waste any more words. Someone as intelligent as you will know the details very well.

Your reputation is known far and wide, and the facts are obvious. It is a pity that you yourself do not seem to value it. Apart from you, all the officials are often frightened and at a loss when faced with danger, fooling themselves and others. You are experienced in national planning, thoughtful and thorough, and resist all kinds of relentless accusations with unwavering will. All of this, morally speaking, is due to your credible reputation and is what we admire. But as of today, what you should overcome is also this.

You should cherish your reputation, otherwise it will be lost in the blink of an eye, as the saying goes. Today, France has everything to offer, and you can take it all, but only for the sake of the country, and nothing else matters. However, time is of the essence, and the disposal must be thorough. If there is even the slightest mistake, France will return to political division and chaos. If this were to happen, no one in the government or the opposition would be able to fight for the motherland, because this crisis is unprecedented in the history of France.

At present, you are the only one who can bring the people to safety. There are many factors, too numerous to list. And some of them are rare and difficult to obtain. We are willing to follow in your footsteps, and you should also follow the will of the people. With your qualities, in this environment, you cannot be aloof. There is no one else to turn to. I sincerely hope that you will act with sincerity and complete the heavy task with internal motivation. Because if not, tragedy will come quickly.

If you can persevere to the end, you can be sure of final victory. Even if you fail, you can have a clear conscience before conscience and history. If you are just perfunctory, dare not offend anyone in everything, or are too cautious, worrying too much, and missing the opportunity, then failure cannot be avoided. By the time the situation is irreversible, it will be too late to regret.

In short, success or failure has reached the final moment, and you alone must choose and decide. If I did not speak in a serious tone, I would not be able to see the urgency of this period. Now is not the time for politicians to play tricks. You are responsible for completing the great and heroic cause. As for how to do it, you can decide for yourself.

You don't need to seek help from others. Consulting advisors is useless, and even senior officials and veterans will not help. These people are old and weak, ignorant and senile, and cannot keep up with the times. If you adopt their seemingly correct but actually wrong proposals, it will lead to the destruction of the country. And these corrupt elements will sigh and flee to the United States, publishing their grand theories in various magazines in their 'it's all my fault' tone.

I respectfully urge you to take your own views as your own, and only listen to your own words. Deep in your heart, you should know that you are a republican citizen, a democratic citizen, and a son of the nation. You should sincerely save the fate of France, and not just serve France with words. If you can accept my humble advice, you will make a great contribution and add new value to the world's democratic politics. Jules Romains"

At the end of the letter, I added a sentence, telling him that I was going to England that evening and was scheduled to return to France on the 11th. On the day I returned, Daladier immediately summoned me for a conversation. I stepped into his official residence on Rue Saint-Dominique and saw that he was as elegant as I had seen him in the spring of 1926. His face was slightly fuller than before, and he looked even more rosy and substantial. His eyes showed a slight weariness amid their kindness, but his gaze was still very sharp, and the tone of his conversation was the same as before. As soon as he saw me, he immediately reached out his hands.

"Jules Romains, your letter has been very beneficial to me."

We talked casually, and everyone was frank and selfless. We talked about all the dangerous situations at home and abroad. I informed him of the impressions and news I had obtained in England, and what I said was in line with the views in my letter. (To be continued)

### Another Victory for the British Air Force: Seven Italian Ships Destroyed, Three of Six Italian Battleships Eliminated; British Prime Minister Reports to the House with Great Excitement

London – According to today’s Admiralty communique, aircraft from the British Naval Air Arm attacked the Italian fleet at its main base in Taranto on the evening of November 11th. It has now been confirmed that three of the six Italian battleships, as well as two cruisers and two auxiliary ships, were destroyed. The Italian battleship fleet has a total strength of six battleships, including two recently added Littorio-class ships and four recently modernized Cavour-class ships. The Littorio-class battleships displace 35,000 tons each and are the most modern warships in the Italian navy, having joined the fleet in Genoa in May of this year. Their armament includes nine 15-inch guns, twenty-four other guns of various sizes, and forty anti-aircraft machine guns. They have a speed of 30 knots per hour, carry three aircraft, and have a total crew of 1,600 men. The four Cavour-class battleships have recently been modernized and displace 31,000 tons each, equipped with ten 12.6-inch guns and other armaments, including thirty-nine anti-aircraft machine guns, four aircraft each, and a total crew of 1,100 men. It has been determined that one Littorio-class ship and two Cavour-class ships were destroyed by British aircraft. Therefore, only three Italian battleships are currently operational. Two aircraft did not return. (Reuters, 13th)

London – Today, when Prime Minister Churchill announced the overwhelming victory of the Naval Air Arm's bombing of the Italian fleet in Taranto in the House of Commons, the House cheered for several minutes. When the Prime Minister mentioned the destruction of a Littorio-class battleship, he explained that this type of warship was very powerful and that the Italian fleet was numerically stronger than the British Mediterranean Fleet. However, for some reason, they resolutely refused to engage in combat. The Prime Minister also stated that the British Naval Air Arm's action was a glorious continuation of the war and that only three Italian battleships remain operational. This result not only affects the balance of naval power in the Mediterranean but also reverberates in naval situations around the world. (Reuters, 13th)

### German Warship Attacks British Convoy in the Atlantic: One-Quarter Escapes from Thirty-Eight Ships; HMS Jervis Bay Fights Bravely, Catches Fire, and Sinks

London – The British armed merchant cruiser HMS Jervis Bay (14,000 tons) left the convoy to attack a German warship in the Atlantic. Although the Jervis Bay was hit by the German warship, caught fire, and sank, its guns continued to roar. Therefore, most of the ships in the convoy were able to scatter and escape in the fading light. This is the same convoy that the German command claimed to have annihilated. Two ships have safely arrived in a Scottish port. The British Admiralty communiqué describing this glorious maritime event stated that a British convoy of thirty-eight ships was attacked by an enemy warship on the night of the 5th of this month. Except for nine ships, the rest had already escaped safely. It is possible that several of the missing British ships are safe. Although this large convoy encountered a powerful enemy attacker, the fact that three-quarters of the ships were spared destruction was due to the skillful dispersal of the merchant ship captains, the use of smoke screens, and the bravery of the escorting HMS Jervis Bay. The details are not yet fully known. It is only known that HMS Jervis Bay approached the enemy warship and engaged it with weapons of vastly different firepower, allowing most of the convoy ships to scatter and escape. HMS Jervis Bay was hit by many shells and was engulfed in flames, but continued to fire its guns. Two hours later, the ship exploded, and the hull was almost completely lost. Sixty-five members of the crew of the ship escaped and were rescued by a merchant ship. Twenty ships that escaped from the convoy have now arrived in port. According to eyewitnesses to the battle, the attacking warship fired several shots at first, and HMS Jervis Bay was hit and badly damaged. It quickly caught fire and gradually sank, with seawater washing over the deck, but it continued to fire its guns. The enemy warship fired at intervals of five shots, and the shells were accurate. At that time, the enemy warship was eight miles away, and it was estimated that its guns were 11-inch caliber. HMS Jervis Bay fought very bravely, first leaving the convoy to meet the attack, while the other ships were ordered to disperse as dusk fell. The crew of HMS Jervis Bay must have known that their fate was in grave danger, but they still did their best to continue bombarding the German warship with more guns and greater firepower, maintaining their glorious tradition until they caught fire and sank. The sound of gunfire was still heard as other ships fled to safety. The fact that the crews of the other ships were able to preserve their lives was due to the heroic actions of HMS Jervis Bay. It is said that the convoy was carrying food and materials back to Britain, and the largest ship was the Rangitiki. The captain of HMS Jervis Bay, Fegan, served as the captain of the British cruiser HMS Suffolk stationed in China several years ago. On one occasion, he bravely led his men to rescue the crew of a ship that had run aground between southern China and the Philippines, for which he received special commendation. HMS Jervis Bay was normally an Australian mail ship, with a total of fifteen senior officers and one hundred and seventy-four ordinary crew members. (Reuters, 13th)

### British Convoy Attacked in North Sea: Several German Aircraft Shot Down

London – An Admiralty communiqué stated that on Monday evening, a British convoy was attacked by German aircraft in the North Sea.

Last night, German broadcasts claimed that German aircraft had sunk five British ships totaling 37,000 tons in this attack on the convoy. Later, a German military headquarters communiqué also claimed to have sunk seven British merchant ships totaling 44,000 tons. However, both of these claims are false. In fact, no ships were sunk. Only two ships were slightly damaged, but they are now all safe. (Reuters, 13th)

### Pétain Explains Reform Plan: Divides France into Twenty Administrative Regions, Strengthens Government Authority

Clermont-Ferrand, France – Marshal Pétain met with a reporter from "Floral Weekly" today and gave a speech explaining the government's reasons for reforming administrative institutions. He said, in summary, that since the great revolution of the 18th century, our country's local administration has divided the country into eighty-six provinces, each with a governor in charge of all administrative matters. This reform's main goal is to strengthen government authority. The government, based on geographical and political conditions, will divide the country into twenty administrative regions, each region including three, four, or five provinces. The affairs of each region will be managed by an administrative commissioner. The administrative commissioner will have jurisdiction over the governors of the provinces under his jurisdiction and will be directly controlled by the central government. Thereafter, the functions of the provincial governors will be purely administrative rather than political. We are now building this administrative structure to restore order and vitality. Everything will be ready and put into practice. All citizens should contribute to helping me, with one heart and one mind, to revive the motherland. (Havas, 12th)

### Recent Developments of the China Economic Reconstruction Association

(Hong Kong Correspondence) The China Economic Reconstruction Association was established in April 1939. The association is divided into eight groups: Transportation, Industry, Mining, Agriculture, Water Conservancy, Public Utilities, Construction, and Economics. The main purpose is to unite experts in various departments in the country to study the overall plan for China's economic reconstruction in the future. In the first joint meeting of the groups, an economic construction plan has been drafted, which must be based on the central government's overall economic policy. At present, each group will first draft a policy based on the Principle of People's Livelihood, the Industrial Plan, and the central government's Anti-Japanese Construction Outline, and fully exchange opinions with the Economics Group. After that, the draft economic policy will be compiled, and then the China Economic Construction Plan will be drafted based on it. In order to facilitate the work, the Economic Policy Research Committee and the Economic Construction Plan Editorial Committee will be established at the same time. In addition to the directors of each group naturally participating in the selection of committee members, a few people will be selected and hired from the members to jointly draft policies and plans with each group. The association will comprehensively study and edit them. In order to gather ideas and solicit opinions from all parties, the association will first list general problems, and then list them into eight departmental problems according to the group, and compile them into trial questions. Members are requested to carefully review and provide opinions on the overall standing injuries of post-war economic construction. The association will then compile them into a collection of problems, which are divided into outlines and nine categories of transportation, industry, mining, agriculture, water conservancy, public utilities, construction, trade, administration and finance. Each category includes six items: policy, plan, system, personnel, capital, and materials, followed by other categories, including questions that do not belong to the above categories. It has been distributed to all members, asking them to provide answers, which will be compiled by the two committees after being sorted out by each group. The first draft has been completed and will be published.

### Shanghai Municipal Council's Economic Committee Recommends Expanding the Library

Given the breadth of Shanghai and the density of its population, the library must be extensively expanded and improved in order to display its value. However, since the expansion requires a large amount of funds, the Special Economic Committee of the Municipal Council, although wanting to recommend expansion, did not do so in the end. However, the committee has recommended that the library's book purchase budget for the next year be increased from 20,000 yuan to 40,000 yuan, and more non-fiction books should be added. At the same time, Japanese magazines and scientific publications should also be purchased.

In recent years, the library's work has become increasingly developed, and the original staff is insufficient to allocate. A deputy director and an assistant should be hired immediately, and a servant should be hired. The definite salary scale for each staff member is currently lacking and should be formulated by the bureau. Due to the income from book subscriptions, this year's estimate is only 8,700 yuan. This association advocates that the subscription fee for books should be increased by 50% thereafter to increase income. Also, one-third of the subscribers are residents of the French Concession. The Municipal Council should send a letter to the French Municipal Council to allocate subsidies to assist.

### Sichuan Provincial Government Establishes Advanced Leather Manufacturing Vocational School: Hires Leather Manufacturing Expert Zhang Quan as Factory Director to Cultivate Leather Manufacturing Talents for National Use

(Chengdu Aviation News) The leather manufacturing industry is one of the four major light industries, along with the dyeing and weaving industry, the cotton textile industry, and the rubber manufacturing industry. Its raw material consumption is second only to cotton textiles. Therefore, European and American countries attach great importance to it and have established special schools to improve technology. China has a vast territory and abundant products, and the production of cattle and sheepskins is very abundant. Sichuan sheepskin is famous all over the world. Unfortunately, there are no good leather factories to refine it, so it is mostly sold abroad. Foreigners refine it into finished goods and resell it to Chinese people. The loss is very obvious. Now, the provincial government, in view of this, in order to promote the development of the leather manufacturing industry in this province, improve raw materials and technology, and further improve the leather manufacturing industry in the country, imitates Europe and the United States to establish an advanced leather manufacturing vocational school to cultivate leather manufacturing talents for national use. The contents of this school are briefly described as follows:

Selection of School Site In 1937, the Sichuan Construction and Education Bureaus subsidized the Chemistry Department of the College of Science of West China University with 9,000 yuan to build two experimental leather factories for the purpose of improving the leather in this province. At that time, due to limited funding, the equipment was not perfect. Therefore, in the spring of this year, another 30,000 yuan was subsidized as a purchase of machinery and start-up expenses, which was managed by a committee composed of three organs, and leather expert Zhang Quan was hired as the factory director. In order to facilitate the students of this school to practice, the school site is temporarily located in Huaxi New Village. After the permanent school site is determined, it will be built.

Existing Equipment in the Factory One spraying machine, one bark tanning machine, one dyeing drum, one leather rolling and polishing machine, one leather kneading wheel, and one trough. The above items can be installed within next month. In addition, there are twenty-four lemon tanks, six lemon immersion tanks, two large gray pools (and various utensils, other such as water towers, grinders, polishing machines, etc., are being purchased and built.

Curriculum Distribution First year of high school: chemistry, physics, biology, mathematics, English, Chinese, civics, physical education. Second year: elementary leather manufacturing, qualitative analysis, quantitative analysis, organic chemistry, leather manufacturing preparation engineering, English, Chinese, mathematics, bacteriology, histology. Third year: inorganic tanning method, organic tanning method, fur tanning and dyeing method, elementary theoretical chemistry, leather analysis, factory management, factory design.

Equipment The overview of the industry is as described above. Other chemical, physical, and biological instruments are difficult to purchase at present. They will be temporarily borrowed from West China University and equipped in stages in the future.

Teaching Methods In order to achieve the harmony between "learning" and "use", equal emphasis is placed on theory and factory training. All scholars are students in the classroom, and apprentices in the factory. Everything must be done by themselves to cultivate the habit of enduring hardship and hard work. Students must have the knowledge of leather manufacturers and the experience of workers after graduation.

The curriculum of this school is numerous and the management is strict. Students who have no industrial interest, cannot endure hardship and hard work, and cannot strictly abide by school rules, please do not apply.

### Hebei Provincial Xingtai Normal School Decides to Re-establish in Leiyang: Temporarily Establishes a Special Normal Science Department

Leiyang Newsletter: Since the July 7th War, the enemy has approached Xingtai, and the environment is harsh. The school affairs of Hebei Provincial Xingtai Normal School cannot be carried out.

Now that the war has been won and the foundation is solid, and most of the students of the original school have moved to Hunan and wandered in other places, they are deeply suffering from the lack of schooling. People from Hubei Province in Hunan are planning to restore the school in Leiyang and temporarily establish a special normal science department to specifically recruit students with insufficient nutrition and early lung disease, to treat them and teach them at the same time, in order to meet wartime needs. They will also cooperate with Hunan Provincial Rural Medical Vocational School in order to obtain medical assistance. A school restoration committee has now been formed to concentrate on the work.

### Xiangya Medical College to be Nationalized: Zhang Xiaoqian Appointed President

Leiyang Newsletter: The case of Hunan Private Xiangya Medical College being changed to national has been approved by the Department of Education and reported to the Executive Yuan. In addition to the Ministry of Education re-hiring Zhang Xiaoqian as the president of the college, the college will be temporarily located in Guiyang, and must be moved back to Hunan Province for management in the future.

### Basketball Backboard Changed to Semicircular Fan Shape: Xiqing to Adopt this Year; 35 Inches High and 57 Inches Wide; Lingdong Team has Registered for Xiqing Tournament

The 13th Xiqing Basketball Tournament is scheduled to open on the 9th of next month. This year, only Group A will be held, limited to 12 teams. Since the start of registration, in addition to the Xiqing Little Bears and Giants, the Chinese team Lingdong has registered to join. In addition, the basketball backboards used in this competition will be reformed, adopting the latest style. The backboard is a semicircular fan shape, 35 inches high and 57 inches wide, and is being custom-made. The basketball backboard has always been rectangular. Its function is that the ball can use the elasticity of the backboard to rub into the basket. However, according to competition experience, the upper half of the backboard has no function at all. It cannot bounce the ball into the basket, and it is rare for the ball to hit the upper half. Therefore, the American Basketball Association has decided to cut off the upper two corners of the backboard from this year and change it to a semicircular fan shape.

### Foreign Rice Swarms In: Approximately Over 100,000 Bags Expected to Arrive in Shanghai in the Coming Days; Yesterday's Rice Market Rose and Fell Sharply with Extensive Manipulation

The supply of foreign rice is abundant. The Taikoo Company's Hubei vessel arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday (the 12th) from Hong Kong with 5,736 bags. Because it was the Premier's birthday, there was a holiday that day, so yesterday's report did not mention it. Yesterday, the Taiyuan also arrived at the port, also carrying 1,075 bags from Hong Kong. It docked at the company's wharf on the Bund in the French Concession and unloaded separately. The Jardine Matheson Yuesheng vessel entered the port yesterday afternoon. It is said that it also had rice onboard. The exact amount was not clear due to the holiday yesterday afternoon, and will be reported further. It is learned that the China Overseas Trading Company (Norse, Trader) vessel will directly load a large quantity of foreign rice from Saigon, totaling over 57,000 bags.

Yesterday, the price of foreign rice in the market suddenly rose and suddenly fell, fully demonstrating the activities of manipulators. The high and low prices varied by as much as three or four yuan. However, the final result yesterday was a few jiao to almost one yuan lower than the closing price on Sunday. In the early morning, rumors arose, and the price of all rice was raised by one yuan and a half to one yuan. No. 2 Saigon arrived at 70 yuan and was still trying to rise, while spot original bags were up to 81 yuan. The market atmosphere was extremely prosperous. Subsequently, because many rumors were disproved, blind speculators sold out. The market was slightly lower at noon. In the afternoon, there were more rumors of peace that were unfavorable to the bulls. People's hearts were even more shaken. Many large off-market players came out to sell, and the quick-profit business of chasing the wind immediately lost its momentum. The market then fell by a small yuan. The No. 2 rice, which was 70 yuan in the morning, fell to a low of 67 yuan and a half in the afternoon, and closed at 68 yuan. In the morning, spot original bags were as high as 81 yuan 35 jiao.

December was as high as 78 yuan 2 jiao in the morning, and fell sharply by 3 yuan 2 jiao to a low of 75 yuan in the afternoon. November also fell to 77 yuan and was still sold. The market rose and fell suddenly, exhausting the ability to manipulate. Off-market players and speculators should wake up as soon as possible, because blindly following the crowd will inevitably lead to loss of wealth and family ruin. The total daily transaction volume of spot rice was still 10,000 bags, and the original bags were 6700 tons.

### Flour Demand Increases Frequently: Foreign Flour Will Arrive Soon

Yesterday was the first day of trading for flour after the holiday. Spot flour transactions were quite active, because the price of rice continued to rise, and the number of common people who ate flour as a staple food increased. Therefore, demand in this street increased frequently, and although the wholesale price of various factories did not rise again, the supply has gradually been restricted. The two factories in the city wholesale sold more than 9,000 bags. Returned goods and old single warehouse receipts were favored by hoarders, with prices reaching 19 yuan 1, 2, 3 jiao, and there was still a lack of supply. The asking price of foreign flour was frequently high, but because the settled flour will arrive soon, people's hearts were inevitably discouraged, so this customer had no enthusiastic desire to purchase. The market situation was still in a calm and stable situation.

The market situation of new wheat was quite consolidated, because the arrival of goods has been rare for a long time, and the stock base was getting thinner and thinner. In the current situation of changing international situation, the source of foreign goods was difficult to predict, so people's hearts were all hoping for good. Japanese factories valued the market, and the price of goods sent to the factory was still only 21-22 yuan. However, it was heard that the market opened two cars of Wuxi wheat, with a price of 26 yuan. The market was still stable.

After a fall yesterday, the securities gray market rebounded sharply, with the high and low prices differing by almost two yuan.

In fact, the public debt rebounded sharply, and it was reasonable for the younger generation to gain three yuan. At present, the market often does not react strongly to negative news, but when it comes to positive news, buyers flock to buy, fearing to fall behind. The biggest reason for this trend is still the surplus of floating capital. Yesterday's experience: In the early morning, Yuxing Hongda immediately sold out, and Category C immediately broke through the one-yuan mark. Xinchang Runde and No. 25 absorbed the market at low prices, and then raised one yuan. Lianyi Changji Tongshen and others also absorbed them one after another. Later, although Tongkang Hengfu and No. 38 continued to emerge, the market price was still rising slowly. In the afternoon, rumors swarmed, and buyers became even more enthusiastic. The market price surged, and immediately broke through the two-yuan mark. Category E also suddenly broke through the two-yuan mark.

The result was a consistent rise of one yuan to one yuan and four jiao and a half. Category D paper rose by seven jiao. The total transaction volume was estimated to be more than 2.2 million yuan. A brief table is listed below.

### Gold Market Turns Weak, People's Hearts Wavering and Uncertain, Period Changes Begin Today

Yesterday's raw gold gray market, due to the loosening of foreign exchange and in the midst of absurd rumors, has rebounded and turned weak. However, in the midst of a sharp rise, there was bound to be lingering wind, so there was an unexpected surge, once flying out of 5,800 yuan. People's hearts in all directions were still wavering and uncertain. Since it was heard in the morning that foreign exchange had stopped tightening and returned to loosening, it retreated to 5,740 yuan in the morning opening under the selling trend. Unexpectedly, the foreign exchange only loosened slightly, and a certain bank's bull unexpectedly increased its position, and violently raised the scattered overnight positions, which had not been closed, once flying up to 5,825 yuan. Finally, due to the demand for tight foreign exchange, the upward trend was difficult to maintain, and it collapsed under the emergence of gold companies and banks.

It was estimated that a gold company came out to sell 10 taels to the bank, and the price was 5,740 yuan. After that, the bank helped to fish, and at one time it actually defended the 5,800 yuan mark. It was estimated that a gold company entered the money exchange industry with 20 taels, creating a top plate of 5,825 yuan. Unfortunately, the high price was not easy to maintain for a long time. At this time, scattered households and others took the opportunity to sell, and it suddenly fell back, reaching 5,745 yuan. After a period of hovering, there was a slight upward trend. It was estimated that a bank gave 20 taels to a gold company, which was 5,770 yuan on the 7th. However, because foreign exchange had reported loosening, people's hearts were tired again, and gold and silver companies jointly closed. It was estimated that the bank did 30 taels of matching, and it fell sharply to 5,735 yuan again. Although it was stable later, the bank only did 10 taels of matching at noon, and there was only 5,742 yuan, which was 28 yuan smaller than Monday. It fluctuated by 90 yuan in half a day.

It was found that the amount of large accounts remained unchanged. Some people also said that the problem of the source of cotton was still difficult to solve. Yesterday, there were 1,290 pieces of cotton yarn, and today there were another 680 pieces shipped to Hong Kong.

Spot Yarn Nong Kai continued to advance due to the enthusiastic popularity of the previous day. The opening price of 20-count Double Horse was 1,295 yuan. As soon as this high price opened, those who made a profit closed their positions one after another. At the same time, many said that water can still penetrate the high price of 1,302 yuan last time. As a result, the number of people selling increased. In an instant, it fell to 1,281 yuan, but the foreign exchange rate once contracted, and the actual situation reappeared, rising again to 1,293 yuan. Then it was heard that the foreign exchange rate increased, and the gold merchant sold a large amount, and the table turned loose.

The U.S. Navy transport ship USS Chaumont, carrying dependents of U.S. Navy personnel stationed in China, arrived from Qinhuangdao and is expected to arrive in Shanghai today (14th) around 1:00 PM. It is anticipated that family members of several U.S. Navy personnel stationed in Shanghai, as well as 130 soldiers from the U.S. Marine Corps' Fourth Regiment stationed in Shanghai, will depart on the USS Chaumont. According to information received yesterday morning (13th), the USS Chaumont may remain here for five days after arriving today, setting sail for Manila at the beginning of next week. It is believed that a group of U.S. Navy personnel dependents will also board the USS Chaumont in Manila for a swift return to the United States. It is reported that 130 U.S. Marine Corps soldiers stationed in Shanghai will board the USS Chaumont on Saturday or Sunday. However, it is not confirmed whether the ship is also carrying U.S. Marine Corps soldiers to relieve them here.

Former U.S. Flagship to Sail to the Philippines Soon

Shanghai received news yesterday that the former flagship of the U.S. Navy's Asiatic Fleet, the USS Houston, is expected to sail to Manila soon, replacing the USS Augusta, the flagship of the Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet currently docked in Manila. U.S. officials in the city were unable to confirm whether the USS Houston would sail to the Seven Seas soon.

This Evacuation Exceeds Five Hundred People

According to the American President Lines, the final U.S. evacuation liner, the USS Washington, is scheduled to depart from Shanghai on November 21. It is expected that over five hundred American expatriate women and children from Shanghai will depart on the vessel, making this one of the largest groups of American expatriates to evacuate Shanghai. At that time, the total number of American expatriates leaving here at the urging of the State Department will be close to one thousand. It has been verified that the other two evacuation liners carried 325 people on the USS McLain and 85 people on the USS Mariposa.

Booking Tickets in Endless Stream

American expatriates in the city are currently booking tickets for the USS Washington from the American President Lines in an endless stream. It is reported that 100 first-class tickets, 300 economy-class tickets, and 140 third-class tickets have been sold to date. However, there are still vacancies in all three classes, especially in third class. The USS Washington will arrive in Shanghai at 3:00 PM on the 17th and dock at the Mobil Oil Company wharf. It is currently scheduled to depart from Shanghai on the 21st, stopping at Manila and then returning directly to San Francisco in the United States. However, the current itinerary is subject to change.

Mariposa Arrives in Qinhuangdao

In addition, the USS Mariposa, which sailed out of Shanghai early the day before yesterday (13th), will arrive in Qinhuangdao today (14th) to continue carrying American expatriates retreating from North China. Afterwards, it will sail to Incheon to evacuate American expatriates from Manchuria and Korea. A small number of American expatriates from Shanghai are also returning to the United States via regular ships of third countries, such as a certain ship of the Japanese Mail Steamship Company scheduled to depart from Shanghai for the United States on Friday, also carrying nine American expatriates.

### Zhou Daren Takes Family to Hong Kong

After the French Concession's High Court No. 3 and the Second Special District Court were seized, Zhou Daren, the former Chief Clerk of the Second Special District Court, was appointed as "Chief Examining Officer." Because Zhou refused to accept the position, he has now taken his family to Hong Kong.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Board Meeting Discussion on Telephone Rate Increase Still Pending Continued Handling of Fair-Price Rice in the Settlement

The Shanghai Municipal Council held its regular board meeting at 10:00 AM yesterday. The Municipal Council usually holds its board meetings at 4:30 PM, but this rule was changed to hold the meeting in the morning due to the horse racing. Those in attendance were General Manager Keziwei, Chinese Directors Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Guo Shun, and Xi Wangshu; British Directors Helan, Mitchell, McDonald, and Bauer; American Director Kanai Alanman; and Japanese Directors Kao Xiong and Okamoto Otsusaku. The absent director was Chinese Director Jiang Yiping. The meeting lasted an hour and a half, adjourning at 11:35 AM.

Discussion of Agenda Items

After the board meeting adjourned, a Ping Ming News Agency reporter inquired with relevant parties. The issue of telephone rate increases was still not discussed at yesterday's board meeting, and no decision was made. This was because the French Municipal Council's reply had not yet been received. The other agenda items discussed included the report of the Council's Special Economic Committee, as well as issues concerning beggars within the Settlement and the handling of fair-price rice. It is reported that no decision has been made on the issue of beggars. As for fair-price rice, it was decided that it would continue to be handled.

### Four Banks' Shanghai Branches Deny Withdrawal All Rumors Are Untrue

Regarding rumors that the Shanghai branches of the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Farmers Bank were ordered to prepare to withdraw, a New Voice News Agency reporter inquired with the Shanghai branches of the four banks yesterday. The rumors of withdrawal are absolutely untrue. All business at the Shanghai branches of the four banks is proceeding as usual, and no withdrawal orders have been received. Moreover, the Tianjin branches of the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, and Communications Bank have not withdrawn and are still operating. Therefore, all the rumors are untrue.

### Landmine on Shanghai-Hangzhou Train Derails Locomotive Passengers Must Transfer Trains

Recently, trains on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway have repeatedly encountered landmines planted by Chinese mobile units. Japanese military trains have repeatedly been detonated by mines. A Ping Ming News Agency reporter received a reliable report from the Chinese side in Hangzhou yesterday that the Japanese-controlled Shanghai-Hangzhou train also struck a landmine explosion between Hangzhou and Xiashi the day before yesterday morning. The Shanghai-Hangzhou train was temporarily interrupted. It is reported that around 9:30 AM the day before yesterday morning, a local train traveling from Jiaxing to Hangzhou suddenly heard a loud bang when passing through the Xiashi station. A landmine exploded, and the locomotive was destroyed and derailed, thrown to the side of the road. The tracks were also blown up, causing traffic on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway to be blocked yesterday. All trains traveling between Hangzhou and Shanghai had to stop at the site of the landmine explosion, and passengers had to transfer trains.

### American Motor Vessel Detained, U.S. Consulate Protests

According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury," the American motor vessel "Estetle" was intercepted by the Japanese naval authorities while returning to Shanghai on the 2nd of this month off the coast of Zhejiang. As of today (the 13th), the ship is still being held on the coast of Zhejiang. According to the U.S. Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Lockhart, this morning, he has lodged a protest with the Japanese authorities regarding this matter, but has not yet received a reply from the Japanese Consulate. It is understood that the "L. Estelle L." is equipped with radio equipment, but attempts by Shanghai to communicate with the ship have been unsuccessful. Several passengers on board the ship when it was detained by the Japanese Navy have already arrived in Shanghai. It is noted that the "Estelle L." was previously seized by the Japanese naval authorities at the mouth of the Yangtze River about four months ago and released after two weeks.

### Yesterday Marked the Third Anniversary of the Fall of Shanghai, Citizens' Mood Solemn, Support for the National Policy of Resistance and Reconstruction Remains Unwavering, Precautionary Measures in the Concession Ensure Good Order

Yesterday marked the third anniversary of the fall of Greater Shanghai. Due to the special circumstances, people from all walks of life in Shanghai were unable to hold commemorative ceremonies, but they all made solemn spiritual commemorations. However, all compatriots in the city recalled the loyalty and bravery of the soldiers who fought bloody battles in Shanghai three years ago, as well as the enthusiasm of people from all walks of life who destroyed their homes to help the country. This further increased their determination to strive for strength. Therefore, they are determined to endure hardship and work hard in the spirit of lying on firewood and tasting gall, striving to educate the people, and supporting the central government's national policy of resistance and reconstruction, which remains unwavering.

Precautionary Measures in the Concession Ensure Peace Throughout the Day

The police authorities of the two concessions continued to implement normal precautionary measures yesterday because it was the anniversary of the fall of Shanghai. Additional detectives were dispatched to patrol all roads, searching pedestrians and vehicles. The French Concession also dispatched armored vehicles to patrol the roads for security. The entire day passed peacefully in a calm and solemn atmosphere. The Japanese side also took strict precautions yesterday. Japanese troops were stationed in Pudong, Nanshi, Zhabei, Hongkou, western Shanghai, and various suburbs. Security was particularly strict along the bridges over the Suzhou Creek.

### Wu Kunsong and the Qinghua Army Are Becoming More Active

According to a person from Kunshan County who came to Shanghai to talk, the local Chinese army guerrilla隊 has become more active since learning of the recent major victories of the Chinese army on various fronts and the news that the Japanese army in South and Central China are withdrawing. The Japanese army in Kunshan, Qingpu, Wu County, and Songjiang are finding it difficult to cope. On the 26th of last month, Li, the battalion commander of the first battalion of Chen Yaozong's department of the Chinese army, personally led the second and third companies to ambush at the Lingyang Port area between Chenmu and Jiaozhi. At that time, thirty to forty Japanese soldiers were sitting in two motorboats, passing through the area. The Chinese army immediately concentrated artillery fire to attack the Japanese army. The Japanese side was caught off guard, and one motorboat was sunk. The Chinese side obtained a large number of firearms. Only three Japanese soldiers survived. On the 5th of this month, five Japanese naval landing force shallow-water warships sailed from Suzhou, passing through Jiaozhi and heading to Chenmu. After Chen's regiment of the Chinese army heard the report, they immediately ordered all troops to move out and encountered the Japanese army in the Cangjiawan area. The two sides fought fiercely for two hours. The Japanese army was ultimately unable to land due to the dense Chinese gun fire and retreated due to heavy casualties.

### Special Economic Committee Pays Close Attention to the Reorganization of the Volunteer Corps After the Merger of the Russian Unit, Officers Have Been Significantly Reduced

According to a temporary report from the Special Economic Committee of the Municipal Council, the officers of the Volunteer Corps headquarters have been gradually reduced in large numbers in recent years. Commander Gao is now preparing a plan to reduce staff to save money. The committee believes that the council should approve the above plan. Regarding the changes in the Volunteer Corps staff after the merger of the Russian unit into the police department, the committee has paid great attention to this matter.

### Fare Increases on French Electric Buses and Trams, Revenue Is Considerable, Residents Bear a Heavy Burden, Hoping for a Reduction

After the French Concession Water and Electricity Company increased water and electricity rates on the 6th, citing increased expenses, the fares for public buses and trams were also increased by 30% and implemented yesterday. The general public is dissatisfied with the sudden increase in burden. There is also serious commentary in society regarding the company's arbitrary increase in various fees. Yesterday, first-class passengers on various vehicles decreased, while the third-class section became more crowded. Previously, the company's daily ticket revenue for trams was 30,000 yuan, and for public buses, it was 20,000 yuan, totaling more than 50,000 yuan. With this new price increase, the daily revenue should increase to 65,000 yuan. Its business prosperity is indeed the highest record in history. The general residents of this city hope that the company will consider the difficulties of the people and gradually reduce the increased fares soon. It is hoped that the French Concession authorities will pay attention to the fact that the company's increased profits affect the daily expenses of the citizens.

### Concrete Measures to Control Rent in the French Concession, Abolish Small Leases and Prohibit Transfer of Tenancy

According to information learned yesterday, the French Concession authorities will soon submit a proposal to the French Consul General Majerry to take strict sanctions against acts of manipulating rents for profit and exploiting tenants in the French Concession. According to a senior official of the French Concession Police Department, the matter is currently under study. The detailed measures and regulations on how to impose sanctions cannot be released at this time. However, according to informal statements from legal circles, the planned measures include abolishing small leases, suppressing rents, and prohibiting high-priced transfers of tenancy. It is said that in addition, formal actions will be taken to ensure that the tenant removal fee demanded by the landlord does not exceed a fair percentage. Another clause is attached to the plan, stipulating that if both the landlord and tenant are satisfied, the Municipal Council will not interfere.

### Guangdong Women Sell Goods to Aid Refugees, Soliciting Donated Items

### American Donations of Rice, Wheat, and Winter Clothing, Showing Sympathy for Shanghai's Disaster Relief, Dr. Baker's Appeal Achieves Satisfactory Results, Many Departing American侨 Also Donate Used Clothing

Mr. Baker, the Director-General of the American Red Cross, has decided to take advantage of his trip to the United States for vacation and appeal on behalf of Chinese refugees for donations from those who sympathize with them. The satisfactory results have not been seen before. Mr. Baker arrived in Chongqing from the United States via Hong Kong on October 22. Mr. Weslow accompanied Mr. Baker. The two will preside over the first batch of medicines arriving in China in Chongqing. After the arrangements are properly handled, Mr. Weslow will stay in the Southwest temporarily, and Mr. Baker will come to Shanghai alone to meet with relevant parties here.

First Batch of Medicines Landed in Yangon

It is understood that the first batch of relief medicines shipped from the United States to China is worth a total of 300,000 US dollars and will be transported to China via the Yunnan-Burma Road. It will be shipped from Yangon soon. Negotiations on transportation procedures and defense against surprise attacks are under close discussion. The first batch of medicines mainly consists of quinine, followed by aspirin, sulfanilamide, heavy carbonic acid salt, boric acid, anesthetics, gauze, cotton wool, wheat, etc. If the results are practical in the future, they will be continuously transported to China.

Rice and Wheat Shipped to Shanghai, Jude in Charge

The relief supplies shipped to Shanghai consist of 1,400 bags of wheat and 6,000 bags of rice, which have been shipped from Seattle, USA, and are expected to arrive here in mid-next month for distribution in the occupied areas. Regarding how to distribute them, the Shanghai side will be taken over by Jude, the General Secretary of the Shanghai American Navy Youth Association. Other medicines worth 50,000 US dollars are also shipped to Shanghai to benefit the poor, which is not a small amount.

Winter Clothing Shipped to Europe, Rerouted to Shanghai

According to the Continental Daily News yesterday, the Shanghai branch of the Fei Zhou Church has received several small batches of winter clothing donated by Australia and New Zealand in the past few months, and immediately transferred them to the Salvation Army, the European Jewish Relief Committee, and other charitable organizations to distribute to a small number of poor refugees in this city. Last week, a large batch of clothes from the United States was originally intended to be shipped to Europe for relief purposes, but due to transportation difficulties, they were stranded in the United States. Later, in view of the fact that Shanghai refugees also needed this relief, it was proposed to reroute them to Shanghai. After the news reached here, the Fei Zhou Church immediately telegraphed the headquarters of the American Church in the United States through the U.S. Consulate, urging them to quickly ship the large batch of stranded clothes to Shanghai to meet the urgent needs. It is said that there are two large packages of clothes.

Large Batch of Winter Clothing Arrives Next Month

In addition to the winter clothing donated by the United States, Australia, and other places mentioned above, people in this city have also been donating gradually in the past few months, especially in the past two weeks. At the same time, some Americans in this city, due to evacuation from Shanghai, have donated most of their old clothes to relief organizations, especially women's and children's clothing, so many refugees have benefited. However, most of these clothes are Western-style, so they are only used to relieve foreign refugees. The number of Chinese-style clothes received so far is very limited. Last week, the New York Fei Zhou Church in the United States telegraphed to inquire whether the winter clothing that could not be shipped to Europe due to the war could be used in Shanghai. After consultation with the U.S. Consulate Advisory Committee and the Salvation Army authorities, the Shanghai branch has replied by telegram that these two large packages of winter clothing will be shipped to Shanghai in early next month.

### Yunnan-Burma Road Is Busy with Military Supplies, Parcel Post Suspended, Restrictions Expected to Be Lifted After Two Months

Since the reopening of the Yunnan-Burma Road, commercial parcels from Shanghai to the Southwest have been expected to be transported by this route, so the market price has been stimulated by this and has increased significantly. However, according to inquiries made by a reporter from Datong News Agency to the responsible parties of the Shanghai Postal Administration this morning, the bureau received a telegram order from the Kunming Postal Administration yesterday morning, suspending the acceptance of parcels from Shanghai to the Southwest via the Yunnan-Burma Road. Before the bureau received the above telegram order, it had been actively preparing to accept parcels to the Southwest. Dozens of applications from various merchants to the bureau for early acceptance of parcels to the Southwest were received every day, so they will definitely feel disappointed after learning of the above telegram order, which will indirectly stimulate a significant decline in prices. However, according to the latest inquiries made by a reporter from Datong News Agency, there are two reasons for the temporary suspension of parcel post on the Yunnan-Burma Road: (1) Military supplies and necessities need to be shipped first; (2) There are many accumulated Southwest parcels that need to be cleared. Therefore, the post office's acceptance of commercial parcels is expected to be suspended until two months later, and the previous telegram order will be lifted and acceptance will be resumed.

### American Missionaries in China Are Unwilling to Abandon Their Mission, Missionaries in the Occupied Areas Continue to Strive, Determined Not to Leave Until the Last Moment, U.S. State Department Sends Pastor to Shanghai to Discuss Steps

Regarding the issue of American citizens evacuating from the Far East, according to inquiries made by a reporter to the general offices of various American churches in this city, American missionaries throughout China, although prepared to comply with the orders of the U.S. government, are currently unwilling to leave their posts. The various churches are still discussing the evacuation order. Pastor Robert, who arrived in Shanghai three days ago, is currently discussing the policies that the American churches should adopt with his colleagues in Shanghai yesterday. It is heard that Pastor Robert was invited by the State Department to come to Shanghai to discuss evacuation matters with various churches. According to Pastor Robert, he does not intend to make any suggestions regarding this matter. Almost all American churches in Free China are not evacuating. Whether American missionaries in the occupied areas evacuate or not is up to each individual to decide. However, those who are older or weaker should evacuate early.

Few Missionaries Leave China

According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury," sources familiar with church affairs claim that the U.S. government has recently advised American citizens in the Far East to evacuate, as the Far East is one of the most potentially dangerous places. However, American Christian missionaries, who have been active in China for 111 years, will not leave China in large numbers and abandon their lifelong work. Currently, there are a total of 2,300 American missionaries scattered throughout China. Less than 150 of them will leave Shanghai on the last American evacuating ship, the "Washington," on the 21st of this month and return to the United States.

No Reason for a Mass Evacuation

The United States usually sends approximately 2,800 missionaries to China to engage in church work. Approximately 500 are currently on vacation in the United States, and another 50 have left China at the advice of the U.S. government and the instructions of the church headquarters. In addition, approximately 100 missionaries will leave China in the next week or ten days. A small number of missionaries who have been working in the occupied areas for the past three years will be transferred to Free China to take on new positions. However, there is absolutely no reason to expect a mass evacuation of missionaries, as church personnel are determined to continue their work until the last minute.

American Missionaries Concentrated on the Coast

American missionaries in Free China are not only not leaving the country, but their numbers are increasing. Those who have already left or are about to leave are missionaries stationed in the occupied areas. However, the position of American churches in China is different from that of churches of other countries, because most American churches are concentrated in the coastal areas controlled by the Japanese. It is understood that there are approximately 6,000 missionaries of various countries in China, of which American missionaries number 2,800, the largest number, followed by 500 British missionaries, and the rest are missionaries from other European countries. Two-thirds of American missionaries are concentrated in the coastal provinces from Hebei to Fujian.

Determined Not to Return Until the Situation Is Critical

In the inland areas, missionaries from other countries are in the majority. For example, there are more Canadian missionaries in Sichuan Province than missionaries from other countries. There are many Norwegian, Swedish, and British missionaries in Hubei, Hunan, Shanxi, and Shaanxi provinces. If the Japanese engage in anti-American activities in the occupied areas, American missionaries will find themselves in a very difficult situation and will be forced to move to work in the inland areas. However, American missionaries feel that if they leave the country, they will be playing into the hands of the Japanese. Furthermore, the cost of evacuating American missionaries is huge. After returning to the United States, it is difficult to resettle them for a while, and it is not known when they will be allowed to come to China again. There are many students in the four Christian universities in Shanghai, and there are 60 missionaries teaching, who are very experienced. If they all leave, it will be a major obstacle to the educational convenience of Chinese students. If the situation deteriorates to the extreme, American missionaries will eventually be forced to leave, but they will not bid farewell to China forever.

### Plague Spreads in Ningbo, Epidemic Enters Cixi, Seven More Deaths in the A-Class Isolation Hospital, Decision to Restrict Traffic and Implement Control

The latest report on the prevention and control of the plague in Ningbo yesterday, according to telegrams from Ningbo, is as follows: 1. The 17th team of the Central Epidemic Prevention Team and personnel from the Zhejiang Provincial Health Department, together with the Yin County Epidemic Prevention Department, are actively carrying out disinfection work and cooperating to eliminate the epidemic as soon as possible. The Yin County Epidemic Prevention Department has also set up prevention and vaccination teams to eliminate the epidemic with the greatest determination. At the same time, a post-disaster committee was established, with Zhou Dali as the chairman. 2. Seven more people died in the A-class isolation hospital yesterday. There are still ten people with the plague living in the A-class section. 3. A plague victim was also found in Xiaoxi Town, Cixi, who died. It was found that the person had fled from the plague area of Ningbo to Cixi. After receiving the report, the county Epidemic Prevention Department immediately convened an emergency meeting and decided: (1) to cut off traffic to Yongming Temple; (2) to continue to implement traffic control in the urban area; (3) to send telegrams to each police station and the Guanhaiwei Police Station to secretly prevent and guard against the epidemic.

### Recruitment of B-Class Postal Workers, Examination Date Confirmed, January 19th of Next Year

### U.S. Decides to Expand Maritime Business, Seven Giant Ships Will Sail to Shanghai, First Ship to Arrive in Shanghai at the End of the Month on Its Maiden Voyage, Ten-Year Plan to Build 500 Cargo Ships

After the outbreak of the European War, the ships of the belligerent countries have mostly stopped sailing to the Far East. Although there are still some ships traveling between the Far East and Europe, the safety of the voyage is a concern, making travelers hesitant. Neutral ships traveling to the Far East, the Pacific, Europe, and Australia are currently only the ships of the American President Lines, which have stepped up to replace them. In the future, the ships of this company may not be enough to meet the demand. According to inquiries made by a reporter from Xinsheng News Agency to the U.S. regarding this matter, the U.S. maritime authorities are vigorously seeking to expand Far East shipping.

Johnson Inspects

Regarding the expansion of Far East shipping in the United States, when the Dollar Company was reorganized last year, Mr. Ernest E. Johnson, the Far East representative appointed by the U.S. Maritime Commission, was responsible for actively carrying out the work. After being appointed, Mr. Johnson has inspected Japan, Shanghai, New Zealand, Manila, the South Sea Islands, Myanmar, India, and Australia. The inspections have just been completed recently. Mr. Johnson is currently in Shanghai and will go south soon to handle all U.S. shipping affairs in the Far East in Hong Kong, so that he can report his findings to the authorities.

New Ships Launched

The U.S. Maritime Department believes that expanding Far East shipping is a matter of urgency, and in order to meet the needs of world and Far East shipping, it has decided to actively expand U.S. maritime business. The American President Lines is building seven new 10,000-ton giant ships to sail from the United States to Shanghai to join the Far East routes and circumnavigate the world routes and sail the Pacific routes. The first new ship, the "President Jackson," was launched in mid-September of this year. It is currently being renovated internally and will depart from the United States at the end of this month and sail to the Far East. It is expected to arrive in port on the 12th of next month, and then go to the South Seas from Shanghai for its world circumnavigation maiden voyage.

Ten-Year Plan

The U.S. authorities are also actively dispatching ships to carry out maritime cargo transportation in the future. Although this cannot be realized for the time being, within ten years, according to a person in charge speaking to a reporter, the U.S. cargo fleet will expand to 500 ships, of which 350 will sail in the Far East, Pacific, and Atlantic, and the remaining 150 will be used as supplements. Once this shipping network is completed, it will dominate Eurasia. It is understood that Mr. Johnson, the Far East representative of the U.S. Maritime Commission, came to the Far East in 1919 and often traveled between Hong Kong and Shanghai, responsible for U.S. shipping affairs.

Resumption of Hong Kong and Vietnam Routes

As for the British and French ships sailing the Hong Kong-Vietnam-Shanghai route, since the Japanese army invaded South Vietnam on September 25, the British ships have stopped sailing to Haiphong and Saigon, and the French ships followed suit. Guangzhou Bay is also included. This matter has greatly affected the freight transportation of Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Guangzhou Bay. According to reliable sources obtained by the reporter, the British naval authorities, seeing that the situation has eased and having reached an agreement with the French, have approved the British and French ships to resume the Hong Kong route first. Negotiations on resuming navigation to various ports in Vietnam will be conducted in the short term to make a final decision. However, the resumption of navigation is still pending.

### Shanghai Jewish Refugee Relief Society Handles Evacuation Work

It has reached an agreement with the British Honduran government of the Americas and plans to continue sending refugees there to open up an industrial cooperation zone.

### Shooting of Japanese Officer, Japanese Side Conducts Major Search, Japanese Serviceman Assassinated Must Hold an Important Position, Strict Inspection of Pedestrians and Vehicles Continued Yesterday

According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury," regarding the shooting of a high-ranking Japanese officer (yesterday, the 10th) in the morning on the Qiujiang Road, the Japanese authorities today (the 13th) are trying to arrest the murderer and have sent plainclothes Japanese military police to search buses and pedestrians in the Qiujiang district. It has not been possible to obtain information from the Japanese authorities regarding who the person shot yesterday was. It is believed that the Japanese officials' silence on this matter shows that the Japanese serviceman assassinated must hold an important position. It is also not possible to find out how the person was injured. It is understood that the murderer fled immediately after firing several shots. It is said that the Japanese authorities already know who committed the murder and are continuing to conduct a major search this morning.

### Two Cases of Extortion: Major Sum Extortion Solved, Chen Jianjing Extorted for 200,000 Yuan, Carriage Driver Conspires to Extort 50,000 Yuan

Chen Jianjing, owner of the Shenfeng Yarn Shop at 365 Ningbo Road, recently received a threatening letter from a self-proclaimed party, demanding that Chen support the party's military expenses, setting the price at 200,000 national currency. The language in the letter was extremely threatening. The day before yesterday, Chen received a phone call from the bandits, stipulating that the money must be delivered to the intersection of Hankou Road and Guangxi Road at 9:00 PM on the 12th. After Chen reported to the Public Concession Police, detectives were ordered to

wait in ambush. When the time came, two bandits arrived and contacted Chen's representative, Gu Ruizhi. They were immediately arrested by the detectives and taken back to the police station. Upon interrogation, the two bandits were identified as Zhang Shiqi (from Pudong) and Zhou Xihua (from Tongzhou). Based on their confessions, another person, Zhou Rushi from Tongzhou, was arrested at room 319 of the Mingshan Hotel on Guangxi Road. At the time, Zhou was entertaining a guide, a woman named Wang Meijuan, and Wang Xiaomei.

Investigations revealed that Zhang Shiqi and Zhou Rushi were adjutants of a certain unit in Pudong. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Special District Court. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi stated that the case required further investigation, so he requested a postponement for further questioning. After reporting to the judge for approval, the request was granted. Jin Rongsheng, a Chinese comprador of a certain foreign firm at 181 Jiangxi Road, residing at 75 Xiangkang Lane, Gubai Road, hired Zhang Buqi (aka A Da), a Jiangbei native, as a carriage driver. On the 21st of last month,

because he was laid off, Jin received three threatening letters from a bandit gang from the 19th of last month to the 10th of this month, demanding 50,000 yuan. The third letter contained two bullets, instructing him to deliver the money to Changchun Road in Zhabei. After Jin reported to the Xinzha Police Station, detectives were dispatched to investigate. Suspicion fell on the laid-off carriage driver, Zhang Buqi. While the investigation was underway,

Zhang suddenly went to Jin's residence to collect his bedding and was arrested by detectives. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the Special District Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan presented the case and requested detention. Judge Zhong ordered Zhang to be detained for a future hearing.

### Handgun Robbery, Gatekeeper Shot and Killed

Lu Guoheng, 38 years old from Jingjiang, employed as a gatekeeper by Zhao Qiming, a wealthy Shanghai businessman living at 16 Laoshifu Road, was robbed by two bandits carrying Mauser pistols at 6:00 PM on the 10th while on duty. The bandits snatched Lu's service pistol. Lu resisted and was shot in the left leg, damaging a blood vessel. He died at 11:30 PM that night due to lack of medical attention. It is reported that Lu died in the line of duty, leaving behind an elderly mother, a wife, and three children. This has created a problem for the family's livelihood. The employer, Mr. Cao, has provided 400 yuan for funeral expenses to Lu's widow, Mrs. Lu Ma, for the coffin and burial of Lu's body. The issue of compensation will be discussed and generously allocated by the police and the employer.

### 56,000 Bags of Flour: Export Disputes, Plaintiff Takes Opportunity to Demand Huge Sum for Intervention, Defendant's 3,000 Yuan Check Bounced

A certain Li Tianhui recently hired a lawyer to file a complaint with the First Special District Civil Court, requesting a judgment ordering Licheng Company to pay a check for 3,000 yuan. Judge Tao Dejun opened the Civil Division One Court for a hearing yesterday. The plaintiff's lawyer stated that in late June of this year, the defendant entrusted the plaintiff to obtain an export permit for 30,000 bags of flour, agreeing to pay

a handling fee of one dime per bag. When the defendant shipped the flour, they paid the plaintiff a check for 1,000 yuan. Later, the defendant asked someone else to obtain an export permit to ship 16,000 bags of flour. Unexpectedly, the shipment was intercepted by a certain military unit at the Suzhou Creek estuary. The defendant then asked the plaintiff to find a way to resolve the issue. The plaintiff informed the defendant that 10,000 yuan was needed for intervention. The defendant finally agreed to pay 15,000 yuan, which the plaintiff used to successfully secure the release of the shipment. However, the defendant

failed to honor the 3,000 yuan check previously given to the plaintiff. Despite repeated negotiations, the debt remained unpaid, leaving the plaintiff with no choice but to file a lawsuit for payment of the check. It is said that the defendant's flour was destined for the occupied areas of Xuzhou, etc. The defendant Licheng Company's lawyer, Yao Fuyuan, argued that the plaintiff had originally agreed in late June to obtain an export permit for the defendant to ship 56,000 bags of flour to the interior, agreeing to a handling fee of one dime per bag, totaling 9,600 French francs. A 3,000 yuan check was immediately paid to the plaintiff. On June 28th, the first

shipment of 30,000 bags was indeed able to pass without obstruction. Later, 26,000 bags were shipped to the Suzhou Creek estuary and were suddenly intercepted by a certain military unit, claiming the permit was incomplete. The defendant negotiated with the plaintiff, but the plaintiff was evasive. Since the 26,000 bags of flour were worth hundreds of thousands and there was a risk of an accident and great loss, the defendant strongly urged the plaintiff to find a solution quickly. The plaintiff then demanded a handling fee of one yuan per bag. After repeated negotiations between the defendant and the plaintiff, the

handling fee for the 56,000 bags of flour increased to 15,000 yuan. The defendant agreed and paid the plaintiff 15,000 yuan in cash on July 1st, stating that the 3,000 yuan check previously given to the plaintiff must be returned. The plaintiff said the check had already been deposited into the bank and would be returned to the defendant after it was retrieved from the bank. Unexpectedly, the plaintiff filed a lawsuit based on the check. The defendant has already suffered a loss of nearly 10,000 yuan due to the plaintiff's lack of responsibility and cannot afford to lose another 3,000 yuan. The court reviewed the arguments and, as both parties held different views, deemed it necessary to summon witnesses for investigation. The court announced that the case would be adjourned to November 15th at 2:00 PM for further hearing.

Free Talk

Free Debate: Where Should Women Go? (4)

### Women Should Return to the Family

— Qi Zhai

(6) Women and Self-Reliance: In any setting, being able to earn a livelihood and support oneself by contributing to society directly or indirectly through one's own efforts is self-reliance. The same applies to women. As long as they are not idle all day long, and can earn a living by doing beneficial work, such as raising and educating children, they are absolutely not dependent on others.

(7) Women and the Family: The family is originally a mutual aid group formed by men and women based on physiological, psychological, and environmental needs. Since the family is formed out of necessity, everything within the family is naturally most suitable for women's needs, allowing them to develop their unique instincts and achieve their great careers. As for the current irrationality of the family or the contempt and oppression women face, it is because people do not understand the "reason" for forming a family, nor do they know the importance of women in the family, and also because women themselves do not know their own importance. Therefore, as long as everyone understands the "reason" for forming a family and eliminates misconceptions, the family will become rational. On the other hand, if women exert their instinctive power and make themselves an important member with great responsibilities, they will not be despised or oppressed.

(8) Conclusion: People who are concerned about women's issues (not necessarily sociologists) are dissatisfied with the status quo and want to improve it, simply because they feel that women's lives are unreasonable. Now, women physiologically need a place to complete the work of "reproductive special ability" that can provide her with free work and free rest, psychologically need to exert her "maternal love special ability", and society and the country need a reasonable environment for women to produce healthy people. Women also need to complete a self-reliant career that suits her physiological and psychological special abilities in a reasonable environment. The "family" happens to be able to accommodate all of the above needs, then "women returning to the family" is the most reasonable and should be done.

### Women Should Go to Society

— Yi Hui

(6) Women and Self-Reliance: Earlier, we said that women must have a career in order to develop their individual strengths. In this section, we want to say that women should each have a career for economic independence. Whether a woman is dependent on others is determined by economic conditions. Mr. Lu Xun said that if women do not obtain economic rights equal to those of men, all titles are empty. We see many women who manage household affairs and raise children at home all year round, while their husbands play cards, dance, and enjoy themselves and waste money as much as possible. Wives cannot interfere with their actions, because they are using their own money, and they have full control. What women can control is only the household expenses that their husbands give them each month. Some women are even deprived of this bit of right by their husbands. Are women living in such circumstances not a group of "dependent" and dependent people?

(7) Women and the Family: Every member that makes up a family, whether male, female, or child, is important. We don't need to emphasize the importance of women in the family. I often hear people say that a man without a normal job is often the worst husband at home. Isn't it the same with women? If a woman has a proper job, she will feel particularly interested in her children after returning home from work, and she can have a deeper understanding of her husband's career. By sharing each other's work experience and encouraging each other ideologically, their family life will be richer, happier, and more meaningful! Moreover, according to the experience of many professional women, spending the whole day with children is not as good as spending time with children at fixed times, which has a better impact on both mother and child.

(8) Conclusion: Finally, what I want to say is that the issue of where women should go should be determined by where China should go. If what we desire is a true Three Principles of the People's democratic republic, then the equality and freedom that all people should enjoy are also the rights that women should enjoy. We cannot imagine a true democratic country that can confine the women who make up half of its population at home, and not allow them to stand on an equal footing with men to develop their special talents and create happiness for the country and mankind. But, if what we desire is a society where a few people oppress and exploit the majority—and "we" of course belong to the privileged class—then of course we do not want women to enjoy freedom and equality, just as we do not want the majority of the people to enjoy freedom and equality. Before we discuss the issue of where women should go, we should first examine whether our views and attitudes towards social issues are correct. The wheels of the times are moving forward, and those who want to turn the wheels of history backward will eventually be eliminated by the trend of the times! (The End)

Worth Introducing

### Warmth-Keeping Product of 1940

— Shui Zhi

As I wander the streets all day, I always see many young masters and fashionable ladies. The clothes they wear always feel light, thin, soft, and comfortable, vividly showing off their graceful demeanor, and making them feel extraordinarily fashionable. Although the weather has reached early winter, and many people who cannot return to their hometown have frozen to death on the streets, they are not afraid of the cold because of their thin clothes. One day, I happened to discover that their clothes are all lined with Tiger Brand "Rabbit Fluff" or "Camel Fluff" produced by Weilun Woolen Mill. No wonder they are light, soft, durable, gorgeous, and elegant. According to old Shanghai people, "It can be guaranteed that it will never shed hair, which is completely different from other camel wool. What is most amazing is that the 'Rabbit Fluff' produced by Weilun Woolen Mill can also be used to make short overcoats for fashionable ladies. There are dozens of colors. Even older people always like Tiger Brand 'Rabbit Fluff' and 'Camel Fluff' because it makes walking easy, elegant, and generous. But readers must know that when you walk into a company or a silk and satin shop, don't forget the Tiger Brand 'Rabbit Fluff' and 'Camel Fluff' produced by Weilun Woolen Mill.

Hawthorne Case

### The Dancer's Fate

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter 11: Zhao Boxiong's Confession

Hawthorne picked up the paper cutter that he had put down when closing the door again, raised his eyes slightly, and replied: "Regarding this point, although I have not yet obtained sufficient and reliable materials, I can guess that this woman is a person with a weak will. Speaking of Mi, it's really pitiful. She came out of a simple and honest rural society and fell into the melting pot of a material society, and she couldn't help but degenerate. She has sunk into the torrent of indulgence in enjoyment, and she can do anything for the sake of money, selling her body, selling her soul, selling the masses, and even selling everything!"

Zhao Boxiong nodded repeatedly and said: "Yes, yes, she is such a character. I was sent here with a special mission. At the same time, I heard that there was a conspiracy activity, hosted by a social butterfly. I felt that this was also within the scope of my mission, so I started investigating her actions and further dispelling her attempts. I knew that although she had withdrawn from the dance hall, she was still using the dance hall to engage in her illegal activities, specifically targeting public officials. I spent a lot of effort to get close to her. This woman is really extremely clever. In just a few days, she had already noticed my mission. She even dared to turn the tables and play a 'reverse trick'. In other words, she even wanted to use me as her tool. So at first, I tried to find a way to get close to her, and then she tried to find all kinds of ways to get close to me. She had been to my apartment twice overnight. She didn't get anything the first time. The second time was the night before last, the 16th. While I was fast asleep, she wanted to steal my secrets. She had checked my wallet, pockets, and pillow, and finally stole a secret code from my pillowcase."

Zhao Boxiong paused, took out the white towel again, folded it over, and wiped his face again. Hawthorne took advantage of this time and said lightly.

"You are too careless. Since you are taking on an important mission, how dare you let yourself get involved with such a woman and let her spend the night in your room? You didn't carefully hide your documents, and you were so ignorant when you slept. You probably have really fallen into her trap and been fascinated by her!" The tone of these words was as cold as a superior reprimanding his subordinate in person.

Zhao Boxiong saw Hawthorne's iron-cold face, a red flush appeared on his face, and he couldn't help but feel a little ashamed. He lowered his head and replied slowly: "Mr. Hawthorne, I deserve to die! I dare not deny that this move was indeed a mistake. However, the stolen code has expired and is of no value. The effective one, I hid in the hatband, and she didn't find it. So I didn't notice her actions the next day until yesterday morning when I learned that the outdated code in the pillowcase had been stolen by her. This confirmed that she was indeed a central figure in a dangerous organization. I decided to take urgent action to punish her. Yesterday evening, I went to her apartment to find her, but I didn't find her. I knew that she had gone out with someone named Lu. I guessed that they were always in some restaurant, and I finally found them in the Baimei Restaurant." (165)

Small Talk

### Swallows and Geese

— Xiu Bi

The wind is cold, it is late autumn.

Autumn once had a high, clear blue sky and clean white clouds.

And what dotted this high sky and white clouds, as if drawing thin black lines on a blue and white canvas, were swallows and geese.

Swallows and geese, these are two kinds of flocking migratory birds! They are a sign of autumn.

With them, the lonely autumn has life. With them, people who live in autumn feel the meaning of life.

They are raising their heads, spreading their wings, flying far away and back again.

Between the blue sky and white clouds, they are black, long lines.

Children look up and sigh when they see them.

Poets write them into verse, and musicians fill them into music.

But they don't know all of this. They are just flying and flying, raising their heads, flapping their wings, and hurrying on their way in the quiet high sky in groups.

They have crossed many cities, towns, mountains, forests, and deep seas. Their wings may be tired, but they will not stop because of it. In order to seek warmth and survival, they fly forward, fly forward, until they reach their destination?

And when spring comes, they each fly back, raising their heads, spreading their wings. They live in this long-distance flight all their lives. They are warriors who like long marches.

Their bodies are not majestic. They do not have the strength of eagles or the majesty of vultures. What makes them fly such a long road is their courage, their persistence, and their strong will.

Courage, persistence, and strength. Who can't travel a long distance if they have these!

Look! Between the blue clouds and white clouds, geese and swallows are again raising their heads, spreading their wings, singing songs, and marching for a long distance. Timid people! Raise your heads!

### Tibetan Movies: Fishermen's Song Continuously Shown in Lhasa for Three Months, Tibetan Compatriots Eager for Films from the Motherland

— China Arts

(Special Correspondent in Lhasa) Tibetan movies have always been under the control of the British. There are several large-scale sound cinemas in Lhasa, Tibet, and the construction equipment is very modern, but they are all operated by the British. Nine out of ten of the films shown are British productions. The other two or three cinemas run by Tibetans are third- and fourth-rate cinemas. The interior is dilapidated, the prices are the lowest, and the films shown are all the most outdated. The audience is also some of the poorest people.

Because Tibet is influenced by British culture, English is still widely popular there, so British films are not inconvenient for people in Tibet. Therefore, the entire film industry is occupied by the British. However, it has not been the case in recent years. Tibet is warmly welcoming our domestically produced films. The "Fishermen's Song" once came to Lhasa, making the Tibetan audience, who had never seen domestically produced films before, as happy as discovering a new continent. The "Fishermen's Song" was originally scheduled to be shown in Lhasa for two weeks, but the results were unexpectedly good. It was shown continuously for three months, and the audience was always crowded. "Go see a Chinese film!" "Go see a Chinese film!" became the entertainment slogan of the Tibetan people. Later, several domestically produced films were continuously transported there, and they all achieved the same effect as the "Fishermen's Song."

Tibetan compatriots are eager for films from the motherland to give them spiritual comfort!

### Tidbits from the Chrysanthemum Scene (Continued)

The young bearded actor Chi Shigong loved planting flowers. The year before last, while in Beijing, he was careless while planting flowers and got pricked on the finger by a cactus needle. He didn't pay much attention to it at the time. That night, he was performing "Beating the Drum and Scolding Cao" at a certain theater. During the performance, the injury on his finger suddenly worsened, causing unbearable pain. He hastily finished the scene and rushed to the hospital for treatment. Afterwards, Chi told people, "I never thought the cactus would launch such a poisonous attack!"

The Four Great Dan Actors each excel in their respective parts in the play "Mei Long Zhen." Years ago, when the Four Great Dan Actors were all in Beijing, Qi Rushan suggested that the Four Great Dan Actors jointly fund the renovation of the tomb of Li Fengjie, a character in the play. Li's tomb is located south of Juyong Pass, and the locals call it "Bai Fengzhong" (White Phoenix Tomb). The tomb had already collapsed, leaving only an earthen mound surrounded by white sand and gravel, with not a blade of grass growing. Qi initially proposed that each of the Four Great Dan Actors contribute 250 yuan, totaling 1,000 yuan, and erect a tombstone to record its history. In the end, it did not materialize due to other reasons. Someone said, "Four two-hundred-and-fifties (a derogatory term implying foolishness) are of course not going to succeed," which became a popular joke for a while.

Kunqu King Han Shichang's reputation during his prime was no less than that of Wang Hua. Therefore, he was known as the "Syphilis Mei" and "Typhoid Fever." Unexpectedly, Han has not been very successful in Beijing in recent years. It is recorded that in the seventh year of the Republic, when Han performed at the Tianle Theater in the old capital, he and Zhu Xiaoyi competed fiercely in cross-dressing as doctors. Both played the role of a clown. Shichang rarely cross-dressed; if he did, this would be the only instance.

One year, Xiao Yang Yuelou performed in Shanghai, co-starring with Zhou Xinfang and a certain Kun Dan in "Red Mane Steed." The posters read "Xue Pinggui and Wang Baochuan." Xiao Yang Yuelou played the role of Princess Daizhan in the play and was greatly displeased. He argued vehemently to change the poster to read "Xue Pinggui and Wang Baochuan, Princess Daizhan." The peculiarity of the play's title is similar to Wang Xiaonong's song "Thirty-Three Thousand Three Hundred and Seventy-Three," both being original creations.

(27)

Hou Yulan once performed in "Peacock Flies Southeast," holding up a red lantern during a scene where she was being scolded by her mother-in-law, not knowing where to place it. Suddenly, the flame began to burn the gauze cover of the paper lantern. Wang Lan was greatly embarrassed, blowing it out and reigniting, blowing it out and reigniting, her demeanor quite awkward. At that time, Zhang Jinliang, who played the mother-in-law, hurriedly snatched the lamp, ad-libbing, "You're trying to anger me to death, not even knowing where to put the lamp, almost setting it on fire!" However, even in Jinliang's hands, the lamp caught fire twice, making it impossible to explain the situation plausibly. The audience roared with laughter.

Ballad Character

### "King of Depiction" Xia Hesheng

— Yuxiu

Xia Hesheng is undoubtedly one of the top ballad singers in the current ballad scene. He is from Jiashan, Zhejiang. The Xia surname was originally a prominent family in Jiashan, residing in "Xia Ting," which was a well-known place locally. His father was known for his skill in painting portraits of gods and Buddhas, making him famous at the time. Therefore, he had a natural love for art from a young age and was also very fond of music. For someone like him to pursue ballad singing, it was naturally the most ideal choice.

He studied under Meng Youqing, learning "Depicting Golden Phoenix," "Three Smiles," and "Two Books," with "Depicting Golden Phoenix" being his specialty. For more than ten years, he has dominated the ballad stage with this book, earning the title of "King of Depiction." At one point, he was expelled from the Guangyu Society due to some incident, unable to work. Later, through the mediation of colleagues, he was able to resume playing his instrument and return to the stage to make a living.

Xia Hesheng is tall and upright, with an elegant demeanor and a handsome face. He has a good voice that doesn't tire even after singing for a long time, his voice being clear and bright, with each word fully articulated. His inflections and tempos are all appropriate and measured, allowing him to manipulate his voice freely, fully satisfying the audience's auditory cravings. Moreover, his facial expressions and character portrayals are particularly keen, vividly capturing the essence of the characters. He sings and performs earnestly in every performance, never cutting corners or inserting irrelevant jokes to waste the audience's time. This is his strength. However, he also has shortcomings. He is arrogant and has a bad temper. He is not easily "convinced" in ordinary venues, and he immediately "cuts" if the audience "drifts" (becomes inattentive). Therefore, he has consistently failed to find a satisfactory position in recent years, suffering a great loss due to this shortcoming.

As the late great ballad singer Ye Shengyang said, "The making of a great ballad singer does not necessarily depend entirely on his skills, but it cannot be achieved entirely by luck. It is difficult to find someone with all-around talent. As long as one has a special skill, it is not difficult to gain a considerable position." Xia Hesheng has relied on his singing and performing strengths to earn his current position as "King of Depiction." As for his shortcomings, although they are common among great ballad singers, we still hope that he can "correct them if he has them, and strive to avoid them if he doesn't."

### Deanna Durbin Kissed Three Times

— Paul

Deanna Durbin already possesses the beauty of a young woman. She can portray a woman in love, so her recent films have undergone some changes in style compared to before.

In "First Love," she kissed someone for the first time in a film, the lucky man being Robert Stack. Many people envied his good fortune. The second time was in "It Started with Eve," the recipient being Charles Laughton. However, Charles only kissed her forehead, because according to the plot, Charles's age was much older.

Deanna Durbin's third kiss was in "Spring Parade," which is currently in production. The male lead is Robert Cummings, and because he wears a sergeant's uniform and can play both piano and violin, she falls in love with him.

This new film, under the joint collaboration of producer Joe Pasternak and director Henry Koster, will achieve even greater success. Set in Vienna in 1896, with scenes ranging from a village gathering to a palace ball, the musical numbers provide the lead actors with many opportunities to display their acting skills.
