Editorial

### How Will Japan Test the Waters?

Yesterday's newspapers carried a Reuters dispatch from Tokyo on the fifth, stating that the Japanese government is about to announce the so-called "Principles for Handling the China Incident" to explain Japan's peace terms. The intention behind the announcement is to test the waters. The date of the announcement is expected to be in the middle of this month. Prior to the announcement, the Japanese government authorities had already reported these terms to secret meetings of the House of Peers and the House of Representatives. The Asia Development Board convened a meeting on the evening of the fifth to discuss the matter. At the time of the announcement, the "Nanjing Political Conference" may open on the same day.

The aforementioned dispatch uses the terms "announcement," "report," and "discussion," which are novel developments that form the backbone of the news. However, the "principles" and "terms" do not describe the content at all. Although the timing of the announcement is said to be in the middle of this month, if it must be chosen to coincide with the so-called "Nanjing Political Conference," then who knows if it will be postponed again and again, or even indefinitely. Upon careful examination, this dispatch has news value, but it is empty and without any new contribution. What is worth pondering is the phrase "test the waters."

When seeking solutions to international problems, because the situation is chaotic, there is fear that it cannot be achieved in one attempt. Also, because the intentions of the other party are unclear, there is fear of disagreement and stalemate. Therefore, caution is exercised, and testing the waters is done first. This is a common practice in international affairs. Broadly speaking, any responsible authority in national politics and diplomacy who publicly speaks about international issues will not forget their responsibilities and aimlessly shoot arrows, nor will they be presumptuous and speak recklessly. None of them lacks the nature of testing the waters. Testing the waters occurs in the morning, and the response arrives in the evening. The initiator judges the situation based on the response and decides on acceptance or rejection, movement or stillness. This is the function of testing the waters. Last summer, German leader Adolf Hitler repeatedly stated his wishes regarding the Polish Corridor. This was testing the waters. With each speech, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain or Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax would respond with a speech. This was the response. Germany failed to deeply understand Britain's response and discern its determination, and perhaps mistakenly regarded it as empty words and threats, and a show of force. Thus, it rashly advanced into Polish territory, leading to today's European war. After it had divided Poland with the Soviet Union, Germany, seeing that Britain and France were stationed in the west, still believed that it had a way to withdraw its troops. It then declared that it had no intention of engaging in military aggression and sought to maintain the European situation. This was testing the waters. The British and French governments and people unanimously condemned it and dubbed it the "peace offensive." As a result of this response, the German government finally announced to its people that a fierce war had begun. After the "July 7th Incident" in 1937, Japan showed its insatiable demands, and China showed its final determination. Japan recklessly disregarded this and, with the delusion of a quick victory, encountered a long-term, all-out war of resistance. In late December 1938, Japan issued the so-called Konoe Statement, expecting China to accept its principles. Chinese leader Chiang Kai-shek analyzed the statement and replied that following these principles would inevitably lead China to a point of no return. These events are major episodes in recent international affairs. They are historical facts, and they are bitter, painful, and heroic lessons that Chinese and foreign people will never forget. Is it the case that, to this day, the Japanese authorities are still so ignorant of international reality and the aspirations of the Chinese nation that they still need to test the waters by presenting arguments regarding the conditions for restoring peace between China and Japan? If so, then testing the waters is meaningless. If not, can they recognize that the Chinese nation is determined to maintain the integrity of its sovereignty, territory, and administration? Can they reject sweet words, abandon ambition, and absolutely respect China's true freedom and independence? Can they discuss peace terms in a spirit of equality? Then the world will wait and see what the Japanese authorities will test. Perhaps the testing the waters will be fruitful.

Historical facts and lessons tell us much and are urgent. Resistance is a fact. Because it is possible to resist in fact, therefore we resist. It is not because of empty words advocating war that we continue to resist. It is not through curses against war that we can stop resisting. Peace is a fact. We desire peace, advocate peace, seek peace, and will not be deterred from seeking peace by the existence of arguments against peace. If there is not enough to stop the war in fact, then where does peace come from in the first place? Observing Japan's recent intentions and actions, it has not awakened from a dream and is seeking another dream. Although it sometimes knows that it is a dream, it is afraid of awakening because the dream is still sweet. It only seeks to realize the dream within the dream. This is completely going in the opposite direction. Using a distant analogy to understand something close by, using a shallow analogy to understand something deep, Japan's disappointment with the United States can be a microcosm of the Far East problem and a lesson for trying to solve the Far East problem. Whether Japan curses the United States or flatters the United States, it has been unable to salvage US-Japan relations and improve them. We do not want to make pronouncements on what the content of Japan's intended test in the middle of this month will be, but we hope that the Japanese faithfully reflect on themselves. What exactly is the cause of the Sino-Japanese War? Why has the so-called "China Incident" not been resolved to this day? Having hoped for a conclusion but having always gone down a path that prevents a conclusion, who will bear the consequences? Are meaningless tests and high-sounding declarations enough to shake the will and confidence of the Chinese nation? Or will they lead the Japanese people's vision and desires further away from the possible facts of history? It is important to know that war and peace have their factual key. If they are unwilling to find the key, then even if they announce one-sided so-called "principles for handling the China Incident" ten or a hundred times, how can they end the incident?

### Tao Xisheng Discusses "New Regime": Reasons for Delayed Establishment Due to Instability in Japanese Foreign Policy

Chongqing: Professor Tao Xisheng, who announced the draft agreement with Japan in Hong Kong with Gao Zongwu on January 21 of this year, recently published a lengthy essay in Ta Kung Pao entitled "Reasons for the Repeated Delays in the Establishment of the New Regime," which is being published in installments. The first part was revealed today, stating that Japanese official Kagesa and Zhou Fohai originally planned for the "new regime" to be established on February 22. As a result, there were two meetings in Qingdao and Shanghai. Later, it was announced that the date of establishment was set for March 12. However, judging from the current situation, the organization of this "new government" will probably be postponed again. In short, Mr. Wang [Jingwei] must take orders from Kagesa, and Kagesa must take orders from the Japanese military. In late December last year, Zhou Fohai told Wang that the Japanese cabinet had decided to hand over the issue of establishing a "new regime" entirely to Kagesa. As for the failure of the two meetings in Qingdao and Shanghai, it is now an open secret. The reason is that Wang Kemin and Liang Hongzhi must both take orders from Japanese officials Kita and Harada. These two, in turn, must obey the orders of the Japanese military. Wang's obstruction, Kita's obstruction, Liang's obstruction, and Harada's obstruction of the "new regime's" early establishment were all carrying out the instructions of the Japanese military. Japan is currently playing a double role. On the one hand, Kagesa is encouraging the establishment of the "new regime," and on the other hand, Kita and Harada are delaying it. In September last year, it was planned to convene a joint conference in Nanjing, so that the "Central Political Conference" could be convened in October, and the new regime established on November 12. When Wang Kemin was in Nanjing, he expressed his opposition to the "Central Political Conference," saying that Kita had instructed him to oppose this conference before going to Tokyo, and this matter must be decided after Kita returns from Tokyo. On the third day, Kita and Kagesa returned to China together. According to Kagesa, the Abe cabinet had decided to support Wang's regime. These words made Wang very optimistic. However, that same evening, Wang Kemin and Liang Hongzhi both told Wang that, based on the opinions of Kita and Harada, they opposed the candidates for the Central Political Conference and the national flag issue. As a result, the proposal to establish the "new regime" on November 20 was postponed. In October, Kagesa proposed convening the "Central Political Conference" on January 20 and setting New Year's Day as the date of the establishment of the new regime. However, negotiations on the general principles for adjusting Sino-Japanese relations suddenly broke down. Kagesa then returned to Tokyo. The two meetings in Qingdao and Shanghai in January and February also failed. It is said that the reason was Wang Kemin's attitude. However, Wang must take orders from Kita, and Kita must take orders from the Japanese military. Therefore, it is quite clear that it is the Japanese military that is preventing the establishment of Wang's new regime. As for the Japanese military's decision to do this, the international situation is one of the main reasons. Before August last year, when the anti-communist front was most active, if Japan had established a "new regime" in China, this regime could have at least gained the support of Germany and Italy. If Japan had joined the German-Italian military alliance, or if the European war had erupted due to the establishment of a military alliance between Japan, Germany, and Italy, then the establishment of a "new regime" by the Japanese in China would have been implemented immediately without any delay. The conclusion of the Soviet-German pact threw everything in Japan into chaos. However, the outbreak of the European war aroused joy among the Japanese, as they believed that Britain and France would have to withdraw their troops from all areas east of the Indian Ocean, and the United States would also be drawn into the war, not only allowing Japan to freely dispose of matters in China, but also giving it the opportunity to expand its influence in the South Pacific. Unexpectedly, although Britain, France, and the Soviet Union declared war, there was no actual fighting. Italy maintained neutrality, and the United States shifted its attention to the Far East. Britain also did not completely withdraw from the Far East. The result of the above factors created Japan's war-weariness and a desire to end the war against China as soon as possible, so that Japan could take advantage of the opportunity of the European war to expand its industry, commerce, and trade. A serious conflict has arisen between the pro-German-Italian faction and the pro-Allies faction in Japan. The establishment of a "new regime" may further strain US-Japan relations. Japan has not offered anything in return for Germany and Italy's recognition of the "new regime" in China. The recent visit of US Under Secretary of State Welles to Europe has aroused Japan's suspicions, fearing that an early peace in Europe may affect Japan's position in the Far East. The Japanese military has failed to establish a "new regime" in China, which cannot satisfy the Japanese people, nor can it resolve the China Incident. Therefore, on the one hand, Kagesa is urging Wang to organize a government, and on the other hand, Kita and Harada are delaying its organization. As long as Japan's foreign policy is unstable, the establishment of a new regime will have no definite date. In addition to this, there is another important reason for the long delay in establishing the "new regime," namely, Wang's lack of effective military force. If Wang truly had the power to help Japan resolve the China Incident, Japan would not hesitate to establish the "new regime." Kagesa once told someone that because Wang has no real military force, Japan must demand a large security zone. A certain Japanese official also said that assuming there are three million intellectuals in China, if Wang can influence half of them, then all difficulties can be solved. (Sixth Dispatch, Reuters)

### Reuters News Agency Report: Content of the Wang-Japanese Agreement

Hong Kong: According to sources in close contact with authorities related to China and Japan, negotiations on the establishment of a "new government" by Wang Jingwei in Nanjing have been completed and are scheduled to be established at the end of March or early April. It is said that one week before the establishment ceremony in Nanjing, all "Chinese leaders" in the occupied areas will be summoned to a meeting first. It is reported that various disputes among the "leaders" have been resolved. Wang Kemin, the leader of the "Provisional Government" in Peiping, will be responsible for governing the semi-autonomous situation in North China. Liang Hongzhi, the leader of the "Renovation Government" in Nanjing, has accepted the leadership position of the "new government." Regarding the conditions for the establishment of the "new government" negotiated between him and the Japanese side, it is said that they are completely different from those announced here on January 21 by Gao Zongwu and Tao Xisheng. There is no single document including all the conditions, which has been or will be signed. The agreement between Wang and the Japanese side relies entirely on the exchange of various letters, notes, and memoranda between the two parties. Although it is currently impossible to obtain unique and authoritative evidence, that is, the disclosure of all the "true" conditions, to prove whether the above rumors are true, a person who claims to know the facts told a Reuters reporter that the agreement between him and the Japanese side has been negotiated based on the following main terms: (1) The "new government recognizes" "Manchukuo"; (2) No reparations will be paid to the Japanese side, but "compensation" will be given for the losses suffered by individual Japanese and organizations in mainland China during the war; (3) The "new government" will control all customs, with complete tariff autonomy on the surface. The existing tariff revenue in the Yokohama Specie Bank will be transferred to the "new government"; (4) North China will be a semi-independent country (as in the case of the former Hebei-Chahar Political Council), but customs, currency, major transportation, and foreign policy will all be under the control of Nanjing; (5) Inner Mongolia will be a "special zone," and the Japanese side will have the right to station 100,000 troops there, for a maximum of ten years; (6) If other foreign countries continue to station troops in China, Japan will have the right to station troops in several important locations, including 50,000 troops in Shanghai and 2,000 troops in Hankou; (7) As soon as China is "sufficiently pacified," the Japanese army will withdraw from all other areas; (8) Japan will take steps to renounce extraterritoriality, and the issue of returning concessions and settlements will be considered thereafter; (9) Japan will "lend some technical assistants" to the "new government" and assign them to work in various government agencies, but technically they will be under Chinese law. Japanese officers lent to the new army will specialize in training and will not be attached to troops on the battlefield; (10) The "Joint Reserve Bank" in North China and the "Huaxing Bank" in Central China will continue to be allowed to issue banknotes, but the currency of the two banks will be based on "provinces," and the official currency will eventually be a brand new one, controlled by the "New Central Bank" to be established by the "new government"; (11) The current status of the North China Development Company and the China Development Company, which are Japanese organizations, will remain the same, but all affiliated institutions of these two companies will be changed to Sino-Japanese joint ventures. The general basis for joint ventures will be 49% for Japan and 51% for China; (12) Major industries in North China will be based on 55% for Japan and 45% for China; (13) All transportation facilities will be based on 49% for the Japanese side and 51% for the Chinese side, becoming joint ventures, except for the Beining and Ping Sui railways, which will be based on 55% for the Japanese side and 45% for the Chinese side; (14) If the capital currently invested by China in the various institutions to be converted into joint ventures in the future is insufficient for the required percentage, Japan will provide China with sufficient loans to bring its capital to 50%, and the Japanese share will also be 50%, instead of following the general principle of 49%. If China can only add 45% to the retained institutions, the funds lent by Japan will be sufficient to bring Chinese capital to 45% of the total; (15) Foreign companies operating in China must allow Chinese investment of 51%, and those who refuse will be gradually completely expelled from China; (16) Establish a Sino-Japanese "cooperation agency," including Japanese officials and civilians, which will make suggestions for the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. The suggestions made by this agency will be submitted to the new government" for implementation; (17) Foreign loans before December 1938 (that is, the date when he broke away from Chongqing) will be repaid as circumstances permit, and political loans granted thereafter will not be recognized. The above-mentioned "conditions" should be treated with all reservations, because the source of this news is believed to be reliable, but it should be solemnly stated that its accuracy has not yet been confirmed by responsible parties. (Reuters telegram, 6th)

Chongqing: A government spokesman commented on the Reuters report on the Wang-Japanese agreement tonight, saying that no matter what agreement Japan and Wang have concluded, it will be ridiculed and denounced by the entire loyal Chinese nation. Although what has been released this time seems to be nothing more than a re-disclosure of some agreed points, without detailed content and official document format, the various clauses released are not significantly different from the content of the agreement disclosed by Wang's former confidants, and are sufficient to prove that it is true. The conditions reveal two methods used by Japan in its attempt to establish a new order in East Asia and destroy China as an independent country, namely (1) organizing an Asian group by China, Japan, and "Manchukuo"; (2) Japan stationing troops in Inner Mongolia and other parts of China under the pretext of joint anti-communism; (3) forcibly seizing all of China's economic rights in the name of economic cooperation. If such an agreement is implemented according to Japan's wishes, Japan will be able to take whatever it wants in the occupied areas, while continuing its war of aggression in the remaining areas.

### Anti-British Movement in North China, Continued Negotiations Between Britain and Japan, Status of Silver in Tianjin Remains Unchanged, Negotiations on Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Debt Case Ineffective, Butler Answers Questions from Members of the House of Commons

London: During a plenary session of the House of Commons, Conservative MP Sir Leighton asked whether Prime Minister Chamberlain had raised the issue with the Japanese government that Chinese residents in Qingdao, Jinan, and many other cities in China had been instigated by Japanese officials to engage in anti-British propaganda for twelve months and had not yet stopped. He asked if the Prime Minister had informed the Japanese government that unless it instructed its subordinates to stop anti-British activities in the occupied areas of China, the desire of Britain and Japan to promote friendly relations would be difficult to achieve. Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler replied, "Indeed, Foreign Secretary Halifax is well aware that there are still anti-British activities in North China. In view of the ineffectiveness of local authorities in taking action, the British government has repeatedly raised the issue with the Japanese side." Santman then asked, "Then what should be done at this time?"

Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler immediately replied that British Ambassador to Japan Sir Craigie had urged the Japanese government to respond, but no results had been obtained. So far, the Japanese authorities have never attempted to repay the principal and interest of the railway bonds. (Havas telegram, 6th)

### US Congressman Warns the House of Representatives: US-Japan Relations are Tense, War is Inevitable Within Eighteen Months, Sanctions Against Japan Will Soon Be Discussed in Congress

Washington: US Republican Congressman Alexander predicted to the House Mining Committee yesterday that within fifteen to eighteen months, the United States would be caught in a vortex of war against Japan, or a "state of emergency close to war." US officials "fear Japan," so "they are hesitant about the Philippines policy." The Japanese side is taking a cautious attitude towards the situation in the Far East because Japan has not yet decided whether it wants Germany or Britain to win, because Japan is deeply afraid that if Germany wins, Germany will take over the British navy and seize the Dutch East Indies archipelago that Japan wants to occupy. Alexander also said, "If Japan occupies the East Indies archipelago, it will then seize the Philippines, because Japan's Tanaka Doctrine is progressing step by step, and the invasion of the East Indies archipelago and the Philippines are stipulated in the Tanaka Doctrine to be carried out accordingly." (Associated Press telegram, 6th)

Washington: Authoritative sources here announced last night that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee officially decided yesterday to temporarily not take "sanction" action against Japan, and to decide again when there is a "suitable opportunity" and the government "suggests" it. It is heard that the government has indirectly conveyed its views to the committee, but according to official announcements, the bill to "sanction" Japan will be discussed soon. However, as of now, what the committee has discussed is the broad range of US-Japan issues. Democratic Senator Grey proposed that the United States should not implement neutrality laws in the Far East before implementing sanctions against Japan. "Associated Press telegram, 6th"

Washington: The Subcommittee on Foreign Relations of the US Senate met yesterday and unanimously decided to reject several proposals put forward by Democratic and Republican parties, requesting that neutrality laws be implemented in the conflicts between the Soviet Union and Finland, China and Japan. The reasons are that first, the conflicts between the Soviet Union and Finland and between China and Japan are undeclared wars; secondly, these two conflicts do not affect US neutrality. In fact, if the US neutrality law is implemented in China and Finland, it must be "paid in cash" before they can purchase US military supplies, which will not only be detrimental to China and Finland, but also greatly reduce the export of US military supplies. (Haitong telegram, 6th)

### Brazil Purchases Abandoned Cannons from the United States, a Total of Ninety Pieces

Washington: US Secretary of War Woodring announced yesterday that the Brazilian government has purchased 90 surplus six-inch caliber cannons from the US Department of War. The cannons were originally purchased by the United States from Britain. Woodring also said that the US Army adopted 155 mm caliber cannons as the standard. If the United States continues to use six-inch caliber cannons, special shells need to be manufactured. The cannons have been stored in Aberdeen since 1919. The United States sold cannons to Brazil based on President Roosevelt's request on February 9 to supply neutral countries with unusable weapons. It is reported that 29 submarines moored in the Quintal Philia shipyard will be re-incorporated into the fleet and will serve the same as 75 destroyers. It is reported that President Roosevelt will soon draft a detailed plan to cooperate with Latin American countries near the Panama Canal, with each country providing new naval base sites and garrisons, and the United States providing aircraft and anti-aircraft guns to defend the Panama Canal.

### Japanese Embassy in the United States Issues Statement: Many Disputes with Third Countries in China Resolved

Washington: The Japanese Embassy issued a statement yesterday claiming that Japan has resolved many disputes with third countries in China caused by the "China Incident," so that "the third country's misunderstanding of Japan's idea of expelling foreign interests in China can be slightly relieved." Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese army has implemented large-scale military operations due to military needs and has imposed restrictions on the rights and interests of third countries. The restrictions will be lifted "of course" after the end. Japan's damage to the property of third countries is accidental rather than intentional. The Japanese side is trying to resolve it in the most "fair way." The events that have important relations with the rights and interests of third countries "have been satisfactorily resolved."

### New York Exchange Market, Pound Price Continues to Decline, Four Reasons for the Decline

New York: The price of the British pound in the New York foreign exchange market continued to decline today. The reasons are (1) the rumor that the British government may announce its new control measures; (2) the issuance of Britain's new £300 million war debt; (3) the huge figures in the British budget; and (4) the dispute between Britain and Italy over coal transportation. According to reliable sources, many countries such as Japan, the Netherlands, and Scandinavia directly sell all their pounds to African import merchants to pay off debts. The opening price today was $3.89375, and the closing price was $3.90375. The closing price yesterday was $3.9125. (Reuters telegram, 5th)

### China and Britain and France Have the Same War Goals, Hu Shih Speaks in the United States

Washington: Chinese Ambassador Hu Shih spoke in Florida yesterday, discussing the possibility of rebuilding the world on the basis of peace after the end of the war. He first said that the new world order based on the League of Nations was first hit in 1931 when Japan invaded Manchuria. "Until now, China and the civil countries participating in the European war have the same war goals, and defeating aggression and" the philosophy of aggression" is one of them. Not only that, China and these civil countries also have the same concept of peace, at least to restore the world order and reorganize and enrich it, so that all wars of the same nature as the current war will no longer occur in the future. In other words, the future League of Nations should become an organization that enriches peace and has the power to guarantee the rule of law. The establishment of the world order in the future should not be based on universal and empty principles, but should be subject to concrete constraints accepted by all countries, so that there is a basis.

### Hitler Meets Ayukawa to Discuss Economic Cooperation

Berlin: When German President Hitler met with Ayukawa, President of Manchukuo Industries, on the 5th, it was confirmed that Mr. Hitler stated the following regarding the future cooperation policy between Japan and Germany: "The friendly relations between Japan and Germany are built on a solid foundation, and there is a need to further enhance them in the future. The relationship between the two countries will be further improved in the future. In terms of economic relations, I am confident that there can be full cooperation." Mr. Ayukawa will inspect factories throughout Germany from the 6th, and will depart from Berlin on the 15th and 16th, returning to Manchuria via Siberia. (Domei telegram, 5th)

### Pravda Discusses Japan's Position

Moscow: Pravda recently published a commentary discussing Japan's position. The report said that the Yonai cabinet approved the old budget draft (the draft reflects Japan's entire economic policy), and has a tendency to move forward along the lines of the former cabinet in other matters. "According to the wishes of the military, the Abe cabinet used the "General Mobilization Law" to strengthen the government's control of various national economies. Japanese leaders and businessmen are deeply afraid that the realization of this bankruptcy plan will seriously affect Japan's economic life, so they jointly requested the government to weaken the control measures and transfer the matter to the industrial sector. It is heard that the person who has submitted the request to the government includes the chairman of the Japan National Economic Federation, the chairman of the Tokyo Water and Fire Company, and the main figures of Mitsui & Co. Facts prove that the Yonai regime is still purely under the control of the military, and the policy that has already been put into practice is that the Japanese army believes that changing this policy will hinder the dignity of the Japanese army. At present, political and business representatives in Japan unanimously demand that the government re-adjust its policies, and they are very clear about the serious consequences of these policies."

### Japanese House of Representatives Resolves to Expel Saito, The Minsei Party Expels Saito from the Party, A Lot of Trouble During the Discussion

Tokyo: The House of Representatives held a plenary session at 1:00 p.m., and after entrusting the government's proposed bill to the committee, it entered a secret meeting. At that time, Chairman Nakai of the committee submitted a report on the Saito's punishment issue and approved Saito's expulsion. Various committees opened at 10:00 a.m. (Domei telegram, 6th)

Hong Kong: Tokyo News, the Japanese House of Representatives will convene a disciplinary committee this afternoon, at which time the case of Saito's expulsion may be passed. This morning, the Minsei Party decided to expel Saito from the party. Secretary-General of the Minsei Party Uchigasaki Sakuzo issued a statement announcing the reasons for Saito's expulsion from the party, saying that the nation must strengthen national unity and unify public opinion in this extraordinary period. (Telegram, 6th)

Tokyo: The Japanese Minsei Party held a meeting at midnight yesterday, and the order was extremely chaotic. It was not until this morning that it was decided to approve the decision to expel Saito Takao, a member of the party. When the party held a meeting, the pros and cons threw chairs and inkwells at each other due to the discussion of Saito's fate, followed by boxing. Most of the members of the Minsei Party finally decided to support the report of the House of Representatives Disciplinary Committee, and planned to submit the expulsion of Saito today, and decided to support the suggestion of the Disciplinary Committee when the House of Representatives convenes a plenary session tomorrow. The above decision has caused six members of the Disciplinary Committee to resign because they are unwilling to vote to support Saito's expulsion. Many members of the party also plan to resign. Later, several members asked the House of Representatives for leave to avoid attending tomorrow's parliament because they were unwilling to vote against Saito. (Associated Press telegram, 6th)

Tokyo: "Yomiuri Shimbun" recently reported that when the House of Representatives Tax Rules Committee held a meeting the other day, Prime Minister Yonai asked Ichiro Doka, a member of the transcendent faction, what the real goal of Japan's change in China was. The public can understand it and can resolve to persevere to the end. If there is a misunderstanding, the government will take resolute measures to deal with it. Doka also asked, a member (referring to Saito Takao) once made a speech desecrating the goal of this "holy war". Why does the government not take severe measures against it. "The people's freedom of speech is originally guaranteed by the constitution, but it is heard that the Prime Minister intends to restrict or control this freedom within the scope of the constitution. Is it true or not?" Prime Minister Yonai replied, "I am not a liberal." (Havas telegram, 5th)

### England Intensifies Economic Warfare Against Germany: Intercepts Italian Ships and Detains German Coal; Neither England Nor Italy Wishes to Escalate the Dispute; Both Parties May Reach a Solution

London: Five Italian ships carrying German coal were detained by British warships yesterday. Germany supplies Italy with approximately one million tons of coal annually, two-thirds of which is transported by sea. (United Press, 6th)

London: Several Italian freighters fully loaded with coal and departing from Rotterdam were escorted by British warships into the Downs contraband inspection port yesterday. All of Europe, especially Germany, is closely watching Italy's reaction. Five Italian steamers arrived in the Downs yesterday awaiting inspection, and one Italian oil tanker is also there. According to Rotterdam sources, although Britain has declared that all neutral ships leaving Rotterdam carrying German coal will be detained, four Italian ships still sailed from there fully loaded with German coal and oil bound for Italy. Furthermore, six Italian ships are still docked in Rotterdam. According to a Berlin dispatch in a Swedish newspaper, the Italian government's decision to allow Italian ships to load coal is seen by Berliners as evidence that the Italian government is prepared to accept the consequences. German officials believe that Italy's resistance to the British blockade indicates that Italy will eventually join the German side. (Reuters, 6th)

Amsterdam: A report from London states that seven Italian ships departing from Rotterdam have been intercepted by British warships and taken to a controlled port. They are: "Loa Aza" (5,968 tons), "Oderte" (8,631 tons), "Volis" (5,639 tons), "Numiria" (5,339 tons), "Caterina" (4,768 tons), "Abril Sheelto A" (4,170 tons), and "San Luigi" (4,371 tons). The latter ship was detained because it was carrying German coal when it set sail from Rotterdam yesterday. (Haitong, 6th)

Paris: Regarding the dispute between England and Italy over coal, political figures here generally say that, based on news from both Rome and London, a mutually beneficial solution should not be difficult to reach. Neither England nor Italy wants the situation to worsen, as evidenced by the fact that Italian ships are awaiting inspection in the British Downs port without unloading their cargo. Moreover, the British government is prepared to supply Italy with coal at any time to replace German coal, so a solution should be found. In short, the reason for this incident is that Germany wants to use Italy to break the British and French blockade policy. The German government had encouraged Italy to protest to Britain, expressing dissatisfaction not only with the British warships' decision to detain German coal purchased by Italy but also opposing the blockade policy implemented by Britain and France in principle. However, the Italian government is currently unwilling to follow this dangerous path to avoid openly confronting Britain and France. As for the Soviet Union, its government is also deliberately spreading misinformation, asserting that Italy's interests in the Balkans and the Mediterranean have been threatened by Britain and France, and that the Soviet Union is very willing to safeguard these interests for Italy. Its intention is to promote cooperation between Italy, Germany, and the Soviet Union. (Havas, 6th)

London: Responsible sources here recently declared that any Italian ships departing from the Dutch port of Rotterdam after midnight on March 1st carrying German goods will have their cargo detained by the British Navy before being released, without any exceptions. Well-informed sources say that the British government clearly wants to divide the issue of Italian coal purchases from general Anglo-Italian trade negotiations. In other words, the British government is determined to strike a blow against Germany on the one hand, and on the other, regardless of whether Anglo-Italian trade negotiations are successful, it will first supply Italy with its own coal, so that accusations that Britain is using pressure to force Italy to supply military equipment can be refuted. In short, the British government hopes to reopen negotiations with Italy to facilitate the transport of British coal to that country. As for any neutral country assisting Germany, whether out of fear or other reasons, it should be restrained to satisfy domestic public opinion. As for Italy's refusal to supply Britain with munitions, the reason may not be due to German pressure, but rather to Italy's own difficulties, especially those encountered by the Italian arms industry. However, it is true that Italy urgently needs to purchase various goods from Britain. If Italy wants to reach a satisfactory solution on commercial issues, especially the issue of debt repayment, it must adopt a more compromising spirit. (Havas, 5th)

### Evolution of the Anglo-Italian Dispute: Berlin Closely Watching

The Hague: According to Berlin sources, after the British government decided to detain German coal destined for Italy, the German government has instructed its air force to sink all British coal ships sailing on the sea, preventing Britain from supplying Italy with coal in place of Germany. British ships carrying coal from the mines in the Tyne River region, departing from Newcastle, will be the primary targets of German aircraft attacks. In the German government's view, the Tyne River region in England has the richest coal deposits, surpassing even Wales and Scotland. The German General Headquarters has high hopes for this, believing that it will make it difficult for Britain to transport coal to Italy. In addition, German economic experts are also studying the possibility of transporting German coal to Italy by rail. (Havas, 5th)

Berlin: General Goering's mouthpiece, the "Essen City National Daily," published an article today commenting on the Anglo-Italian coal dispute, declaring, "Fortunately, land transportation between Germany and Italy is still unimpeded, so Italy can calmly observe the situation despite the ships being detained." The newspaper continued, stating that German-Italian trade relations have become even closer since the signing of the German-Italian trade agreement on February 24th. German coal exports to Italy account for a very large portion of Italy's total coal consumption, and Italian food exports to Germany have also increased significantly. (Haitong, 6th)

### Turning Swords into Plowshares: Dependent on a Single Thought of the Italian Premier

The New York "New York Daily News" commented on the current Italian-British crisis, advising Britain to adopt a moderate attitude, and stating that if this war is expanded or prolonged, the result will not only impoverish Europe, but European culture will also suffer a major blow. Therefore, turning swords into plowshares is beneficial to both sides. The newspaper attaches great importance to Mussolini's attitude. It is said that the current situation is serious, and whether Italy and Britain reconcile or go to war depends on Mussolini's single thought. Will Mussolini take a step back, abandon purchasing coal from Germany, and buy more British coal, or will he fight alongside Germany and deal with Britain by tough means? We will wait and see. (Haitong, 6th)

Washington: The dispute between England and Italy over coal has been commented on by various newspapers, generally expressing optimism, believing that a compromise solution can be reached. The "New York Times" reported that the implementation of Britain's decision to detain German coal destined for Italy has been delayed as much as possible. "It is common for diplomatic disputes to occur between belligerent and neutral countries during wartime. This Anglo-Italian dispute, however, is due to Italy's need for coal from Britain, giving Britain a perceived advantage." The "New York Sun" reported, "The protest submitted by Italy to Britain, between the lines, has a threatening tone, but it is not a lament." The "Washington Star Evening News" reported, "Although the German-Italian axis still exists, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's actions during this difficult period seem to be primarily based on national interests, with the German-Italian axis secondary. It can be seen that Anglo-Italian diplomats will not allow the current dispute to escalate and will seek a solution immediately, as Italy's position in the Mediterranean is very fragile, and its communication lines with its African territories are controlled by Britain and France. This is known to Prime Minister Mussolini, who will surely weigh the pros and cons and will not completely break with Britain and France." In addition, observers are not as optimistic as the newspapers, generally saying that the Anglo-Italian dispute may have a great impact, for the following reasons: Italy's protest to Britain is clearly speaking out for Germany on the blockade issue, which is one reason. Italy may want to present itself as the protector of the interests of various European neutral countries to urge them to resist the blockade policy of Britain and France, which is the second reason. Italy regards this dispute as a matter of its prestige, which is the third reason. The Anglo-Italian dispute may trigger a movement, although it will not lead to war, but it will be enough to hinder the diplomatic and military strategies of Britain and France at a time when Germany is about to intensify its attacks, which is the fourth reason. (Havas, 6th)

### German Coal Continues: Transported to Italy by Land; Exchanged for Italian Agricultural Products

Lucerne: Several trains of German coal pass through Switzerland to Italy every day. These trains return mostly loaded with Italian agricultural products. The Swiss railway bureau has prepared more locomotives and increased the number of staff due to the frequent traffic. (Reuters, 6th)

### Swedish Ports: No Plans to Intercept Shipments of German Ore

London: In response to a question in the House of Commons today about whether the British government intends to intercept shipments of ore from Swedish ports to Germany, First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill said that the government is aware of these shipments and their relationship with Germany, but preventing these shipments would raise many serious concerns. We have often considered this matter for a long time, but no steps have been taken at present. (Reuters, 6th)

### Italian Students: Anti-British Demonstration; Singing Patriotic Songs

Rome: This morning, many Italian students gathered in front of the British Consulate in Florence to march and demonstrate. The police dispersed them. The students sang patriotic songs as they left. (Haitong, 6th)

### British Government Plans to Promote: Foreign Trade; Establishes an Export Executive Council

London: Today, the British government issued a white paper explaining the purpose and plan for establishing the Export Executive Council, stating that the establishment of this council is to guide the movement of British export trade. Britain recognizes this movement as one of the most important factors in the Allied war effort, so all relevant departments will actively cooperate. The primary goal of export industries and businesses should be to adjust their organizations to eliminate obstacles in export trade. Therefore, manufacturers and businesses must have an organization to work with the Export Executive Council. The export trade necessary to win the war can only be achieved by changing from the domestic market to the foreign market. The Export Executive Council believes that each industry must establish an export committee so that the executive council can cooperate with it and be assigned work related to the national export movement. The problems that will arise in the future may include considerations involving special markets, foreign exchange, political and commercial relations, and economic warfare. The Executive Council will view this as a matter of promotion and joint sales. There is no shortage of demand in the export sector. Britain is currently making great efforts in the South American market and believes that the South American market is currently the most valuable. Overseas Trade Minister Hudson also made a statement explaining the purpose of the Export Executive Council, saying that this type of organization is unprecedented in Britain. Britain has been forced to establish this executive council due to the new environment of war. This plan aims to greatly reduce the domestic consumption of many goods. The British people and their families must live as usual without the goods they are accustomed to or need. We must know that we cannot borrow money abroad as we did during the last European war. We must pay for everything. This is a cash-and-carry war. The government does not imitate the methods of totalitarian states. Neutral countries should know that if they want Britain to buy their goods, they must buy British goods. (Reuters, 6th)

### British and French Trade Talks Underway: Seeking Further Cooperation

London: The President of the Federation of British Industries, Gordon, welcomed the French delegation to England yesterday and began the Anglo-French trade talks initiated by the federation. The French delegation includes the heads of coal, cotton, chemical, wool, metal, and machinery industries. Gordon stated in his speech that the purpose of the discussion is to study at what points and how British and French industries can best cooperate. This kind of cooperation can not only accelerate the victory of the struggle, but also greatly contribute to establishing a lasting peace after the war. (Reuters, 6th)

### US Under Secretary of State: From Lausanne to Paris; Examination of the European Situation is Highly Confidential; Denies Convening a Conference of Nordic Envoys

Switzerland: U.S. Under Secretary of State Welles, recently told reporters in Lausanne that his visit to Europe was of a completely confidential nature, and only President Roosevelt could know the conclusions. When various reporters asked questions, Welles answered vaguely. He firmly denied rumors that he would convene a meeting of the U.S. ambassadors to Norway, Denmark, and Sweden in London. He is scheduled to depart from Lausanne for Paris at 10 p.m. tonight, stay there until the 9th of this month, and then travel to London on the 10th, before returning to Paris again and then going to Rome. (Havas, 6th)

Washington: The State Department and the White House are currently keeping the talks between State Department Assistant Welles and Berlin a secret. However, according to the general feeling of informed sources, Hitler may not be as stubborn as the Berlin American dispatches of Saturday and Sunday indicated. If Herr Hitler is willing to make peace, then his encouraging of interviewers to broadcast claims of various requirements for peace would be all the more reason to conceal the facts. But even if the chance of peace is one in a million, Welles's efforts to find some clues from a mess of threads may be beneficial to all parties concerned. (Reuters, 6th)

### Leprosy: Prevalent in Japan; 15,000 Patients

Active activities have been discovered in the German border area of Luxembourg, through which the Moselle River passes. German troops are rushing to build small pillboxes day and night, and the barbed wire at several crossings of the Moselle River has been removed. Near Basel in Switzerland, new German troops are now heading to the Rhine one after another. It is estimated that there are ten divisions gathered in the area. Swiss military authorities have summoned reserve soldiers to enlist, which was originally scheduled for this Saturday, but has now been advanced to today. (Reuters, 6th)

The capital of Switzerland: The German High Command recently issued a war report stating that our patrol troops yesterday attacked a fort guarded by British troops on the east bank of the Moselle River, capturing sixteen British soldiers and killing several. (Havas, 6th)

### Dutch Submarine: Sunk After Being Hit; Two Missing, the Rest Rescued

Amsterdam: This morning at the naval base of Dinghitelde, a Dutch submarine was hit in the middle by a tugboat and sank within two minutes. However, it is now believed that all but two people on board were rescued. Those standing on the deck of the submarine were thrown into the sea and later rescued. The rest of the crew sank with the submarine. Twenty minutes later, the hull of the submarine emerged from the water, remaining on the surface. Tugboats and warships immediately rushed to the rescue and broke open the submarine tower. Most of the crew were huddled in that area and were rescued. It is reported that the two missing persons were working in the torpedo room when the collision occurred. The submarine has been towed to shallow water. (Reuters, 6th)

### Soviet Troops Continue to Win Victories in the Vyborg Bay Area: Germany Warns Sweden and Norway Aggressively; No Facilitation of British and French Aid to Finland

Capital of Sweden: Soviet troops continued to achieve victories west of Vyborg yesterday and have invaded the lake area north of Vyborg. Finnish military officials said that the fortifications built in the area at the beginning of the war were exceptionally strong and hoped to provide long-term support. (Haitong, 6th)

Moscow: According to a communiqué from the headquarters of the Leningrad Military District, yesterday Soviet troops continued to occupy the towns of Lavensari and Zhen in the Karelia sector and the Vyborg Bay area. The island of Sanio Shari and the town of Niitira northeast of Vyborg (located one kilometer east of the Karlshalmieg station on the Vyborg-Sadoeborg railway) were also occupied by Soviet troops. There were no major developments in other areas. In air combat, eleven enemy aircraft were shot down. (TASS, 6th)

Finnish Capital: A large unit of Soviet ski troops unexpectedly arrived in the Gulf of Finland. They departed from Hogland and reached the Habatzai Islands, then advanced northeast to Virovoi-Diethi to occupy a stronghold on the coast 38 miles west of Vyborg. They were discovered by a Finnish patrol, and coastal artillery opened fire, and aircraft took off to bomb them, forcing them to retreat. However, the Soviet troops are still struggling to attack the islands and fortified corners along the coast, aided by artillery and aircraft. The distance of the islands and the distance to the hinterland are not very far, but it is very dangerous to cross over the ice, because Finnish artillery shells and bombs have broken the water surface and created many huge holes. (Reuters, 6th)

London: Diplomatic circles here recently said that in recent days Germany has issued warnings to the Scandinavian countries, advising against taking any action to facilitate the provision of aid to Finland by Britain and France. If these countries allow British and French expeditionary forces to transit through their territory to Finland, Germany will immediately intervene with force. Even without this action, if they renounce their neutrality to aid Finland themselves, Germany will also quickly take decisive intervention. Although Germany has repeatedly made similar representations to the Scandinavian countries in the past, its tone has never been so aggressive. (TASS, 5th)

Tokyo: The "Shikoku Doshikai," an extreme nationalist group in Japan, recently submitted a proposal to the House of Representatives advocating the restoration of "cave dwelling time" from ancient times. In other words, they advocate restoring the life of working at sunrise and resting at sunset to save electricity. It is said that the reason for using the name "cave dwelling time" is to evoke memories of the era when the sun goddess, due to a dispute with her brother, angrily hid in a cave, and the human world experienced a long period of darkness. Later, when the sunlight returned to the human world, the Japanese people were extremely happy and developed the custom of working at sunrise and resting at sunset. In modern times, this excellent custom has disappeared. At a time when the national electricity supply is in great shortage, it is very appropriate for the people of the whole country to restore the ancient economic and simple "cave dwelling time."

### The Collapse of Huang Dawei's Puppet Army: Japanese Navy Assists Huang in a Second Invasion of Fujian; Huang's Troops Defect to the Chinese Army in Droves; Remaining Bandits Disturbing the Countryside Are Also Completely Annihilated

A dispatch from You Tou: Last autumn, Huang Dawei secretly went to Chaozhou and Shantou to establish the "Peace and National Construction Army General Headquarters," a puppet regime backed by the Japanese Navy with the aim of occupying southern Fujian. If successful, Huang would take overall control of the military power in Fujian Province, while Lin Zhiyuan would be in charge of civil affairs and finances. It is reported that the Japanese Navy, in particular, planned to form a "First Army Group" for Huang, consisting of nine divisions, with 30,000 rifles, 50 artillery pieces, 120 machine guns, and a military expenditure of 3 million yuan, to be disbursed in installments of 300,000 yuan each. When the puppet army group was first established, the Japanese side promised to allocate an additional 300,000 yuan for organizational expenses. The troops were to be recruited and trained by the Japanese army. In September of last year, traces of the puppet army were discovered in Chenghai City and along the Chaozhou-Shantou railway, with a force of about 3,000 or more. They were transported from Shanghai, Taiwan, Xiamen, Nan'ao, and other places. Regarding the quality of the puppet soldiers, half were scattered soldiers who had not been able to retreat from eastern Shanghai, Wuhu, and Wuhan; refugees from the lower reaches of the Yangtze River; bandits from southern Fujian; robbers from the Jinmen and Xiamen coasts; and conscripted men forcibly taken from various places. However, the conscripted men from Chaozhou and Shantou were transported by the Japanese to other places and not allowed to be incorporated into Huang's army.

In October, Huang's puppet troops were stationed in Chenghai City, Anbu, and other places, and were repeatedly attacked at night by Chinese guerrillas, so they were transferred to other locations. However, among them, there were often those who, carrying their weapons, defected in organized groups to the Chinese army in Raoping and Chao'an, as well as those who scattered and fled in small groups of three or five. As a result, the Japanese army strengthened its defenses and stationed troops on the second line. Sometimes, when passing through Shantou, they were ordered to camp in Zhongshan Park, surrounded by water on all sides, to prevent them from escaping. The Japanese army stationed in Shantou had no trust in Huang's troops and secretly guarded against them. However, the Japanese army repeatedly held meetings, urgently seeking to reduce the threat on the outer lines of Chaozhou and Shantou. However, the Japanese army was weak and unable to cross the Sangpu Mountains to open the Anbu-Jieyang road. Thus, Huang's troops launched an offensive towards Raoping to open the Fujian border, hoping to seize salt, rice, bean oil, and all supplies to stabilize the Chaozhou and Shantou society. Huang then crossed the river from Chenghai several times, occupying Nanyang, Zhanglin, and Donglong. However, as soon as the Chinese army launched a counterattack, they were disastrously defeated and retreated to Chenghai. The Chinese army's Li Shaoru, Hong Zhizheng, and other teams also frequently crossed the river on stormy nights to attack Japanese strongholds in Chenghai. Regarding the puppet troops, they expressed "Chinese do not fight Chinese," and Guo Youyi was enlisted to persuade them about six or seven times. The Japanese army, therefore, deemed Huang's troops unreliable and had Huang's troops guard Ouding and Waisha to consolidate foreign strongholds in Shantou. When the Chinese army attacked Chenghai at night, the Japanese troops near Anbu and You Tou did not provide rescue but instead ordered Japanese warships on the sea and marines from Nan'ao and Haishan to provide assistance. On November 24, Huang's troops launched an attack on Zhao'an County, which was entirely initiated by the Japanese Navy. On December 2, Zhao'an City fell, and on the 6th, the Chinese army recaptured Zhao'an City. On the 10th, they continued to recapture Zhanglin and Donglong. Huang's invasion of Fujian thus failed, and the first phase of the battle also came to an end. Huang suffered a major blow and was bedridden in Shantou, not attending any Japanese puppet meetings. The Japanese Navy also complained that the Japanese Army did not attack Raoping City by crossing the Phoenix Mountains in Chao'an to cut off the rear of the Chinese army on the Raoping-Huanggang road, which led to Huanggang and Donglong being cut off by the Chinese army. When Zhelin and Zhanglin were surrounded, the Army still stood by idly, which was quite indignant. Since then, the opinions of the Japanese Army and Navy greatly differed. However, the Navy urgently wanted to occupy Zhangzhou and Xiamen in southern Fujian to secure supplies and secretly replenished Huang's troops, also wanting to move Huang's headquarters from Chenghai County in Chaozhou and Shantou to Chenghai County in Zhangzhou and Xiamen. In early February of this year, Huang's troops gathered along the Chaozhou-Shantou railway, took motorboats to Chenghai, and first transported them to Nan'ao to reorganize their forces and marines into three regiments, and then boarded ships. Another unit boarded ships from Shantou, totaling nine transport ships, with four warships as cover and twelve aircraft providing support. On the 11th, they disturbed the Shan Island harbor and, after landing, occupied Guanlutou, Wangliting, Xipu, and other salt-producing areas, detaining forty to fifty salt boats. On the 13th, they occupied Dongyou City. The Chinese army had only one battalion, which, together with the salt police and four civilian regiments, attacked from the mountains. The puppet troops in the city revolted and repelled the landing Japanese puppet troops, forcing them back onto the ships. On the 15th, when the Japanese puppet troops retreated, they brutally killed over 200 civilians and burned down 500 to 600 houses. All the food owned by the civilians was looted. After getting back on the ships, they moved to attack Dawu Mountain west of Xiamen, landing at Gangwei and invading Haicheng County. The Japanese puppet troops launched a large-scale offensive from Bai Geng, Bai Shao, and Qingyang. The Chinese army retreated to a location 40 miles from the coast, relying on the terrain to resist. On the 19th, Huang Guangrui of Huang's guard regiment and Hu Laipu of the special service regiment led more than 2,000 men and were the first to defect to the Chinese army's Song Tiancai Division. On the 20th, Huang's most elite Zhang Bulou regiment continued to surrender. In the two surrenders, a total of more than 3,600 officers and soldiers defected, along with 2,750 rifles, 48 light and heavy machine guns, and 3 mortars. Because most of the landing puppet troops had surrendered, the Japanese troops on Dawu Mountain were encircled and severely attacked by the Chinese army. The Japanese puppet troops in Bai Geng and Qingyang were also trapped. It is reported that Huang himself was detained by the Japanese army. When this news reached Chaozhou and Shantou, the puppet troops stationed in Chenghai were also monitored by the Japanese army. On February 17, the Chinese army's Li Shaoru from Chenghai and Zhanglin crossed the river to attack Guanshan Township, approaching the north gate of Chenghai City. Another unit joined forces with Hong Zhizheng's team and crossed the river from Sunan, attacking the upper, middle, and lower communities of Nanyang. The strong men of the Li, Wang, Du, and Cai families in Nanyang responded and joined the battle. The puppet troops occupying Nanyang, about 600 men from Wang Tiancai's "Puppet National Construction Army 9th Regiment," had no intention of fighting. On the evening of the 18th, Hong Zhizheng's troops attacked the Cai family ancestral hall in the middle community, destroying all Japanese puppet institutions and burning down all gambling and opium dens. Nearly 100 men under Wang Tiancai's command were annihilated, and 20 were captured and beheaded, with 15 rifles seized. The remaining puppet troops in Nanyang, south of Chenghai City, completely disintegrated at this point. Every day, more than 100 people carried their weapons to Raoping to surrender.

### Fujian Province's Administrative Policy: Provincial Government Submits to the Provincial Assembly

A dispatch from Fuzhou: The Fujian Provincial Government has formulated the administrative policy for the 29th year of the Republic and submitted it to the second general meeting of the Provincial Assembly for discussion. The main points are as follows: (A) The administrative policy is divided into four categories: management, education, nurturing, and health. (B) The spirit of administration is divided into (1) implementing planned politics (including feasibility, completeness, and specificity), (2) cultivating the spirit of the rule of law (implementing the personnel system in all departments and offices of the provincial government, and implementing the accounting system in all state-owned enterprises and establishing accounting offices in all county governments), and (3) enhancing the people's strength (intelligence, wealth, and physical strength). (C) The administrative plan is divided into (1) implementing the five-year plan for the county-level organizational outline (organizational adjustment, personnel training, and business promotion), (2) the five-year plan for economic construction, the economic construction organization, the economic construction planning committee, including various experts and administrative and business supervisors, the content of economic construction, first focusing on increasing agricultural products, such as food, cotton, and specialties, the second focusing on industrial development, agricultural product processing industries, such as opening oil pressing plants, sugar factories, canning factories, paper mills, and flour mills, the third focusing on various small industries of daily necessities, such as textile factories, leather factories, candle and soap factories, match factories, brick and tile factories, alcohol factories, and iron factories. It has been amended and approved by the Can Yi Hui, and the Provincial Government has now started to carry out the above-mentioned administrative plans, sending a large number of compilers and supervisors to the counties to assist the county government in handling the election of township and village chiefs. Each township government in the province has one mayor and one deputy mayor, all of whom are elected by the people. There is one economic affairs officer, who is appointed by the provincial government from the graduates of the Township Economic Construction Department of the Civil Servants Training Institute, and one cultural affairs officer, who is concurrently the principal of the township elementary school. First, the Commissioner's Office of each administrative inspectorate sends section chiefs and secretaries to the counties to hold local autonomy lectures, convening township chiefs and elementary school principals to lecture on autonomy laws and regulations and autonomy affairs for one week, and then establish township offices. Then, the county government convenes all village chiefs in the county to hold a training class for one week, and then take office. After the establishment of township offices and the new village chiefs taking office, the first step is to implement the following measures: (A) Strengthen the autonomy organization, popularize national military training, so as to develop the spirit of national autonomy and self-defense capabilities, and promote national group life and rural construction; (B) Establish national schools and central schools everywhere, implement national education strictly, so as to increase the basic knowledge and political awareness of the people, and improve the national production skills and cultural level.

### Kunshan Rice Prices Soar: Poor People Fill Their Stomachs with Bran and Bean Dregs

A dispatch from Kunshan: After the new grain of last autumn was put on the market in our county, rice merchants in general bribed the puppet organizations and secretly transported it to Shanghai in a continuous stream to make huge profits. Later, the Japanese repeatedly purchased military rice, resulting in a severe shortage of rice and grain. At present, the price of rice has soared to more than 30 yuan per stone, and rice shops and rice stores often report that they are out of stock and cannot meet the market demand. Residents buying rice sometimes have to trade directly with farmers in small quantities (no more than one or two dou), which is very difficult. The prices of miscellaneous grains have also risen accordingly. Soybeans have exceeded 40 yuan per stone, and tofu shops have closed one after another. Poor people all fill their stomachs with bran, bean dregs, and other things that were formerly used to feed pigs. This situation is rare since the Hong Yang Rebellion.

The amount of legal tender and jiao notes on the market is decreasing day by day. Although merchants and shops do not dare to refuse to use Japanese military notes, they are also unwilling to keep them. In the southern townships, such as the more reputable shops in Ba Mo and other areas, they print their own one-yuan legal tender vouchers for use and circulation on the market. As for the jiao notes vouchers (divided into three types: one jiao, two jiao, and five jiao) and the fen notes vouchers (divided into three types: one fen, two fen, and five fen), most of the general stores in the townships have already manufactured and used them.

### An Ancient Edition of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms Was Seized by the Japanese and Is a Highly Valuable Ancient Book

A dispatch from Zhenjiang: For more than two years, Chinese culture has suffered greatly in the occupied areas seized by the Japanese army. Whether it is public or private libraries or private collections, all items that the Japanese consider valuable are taken away. For example, the Chinese ancient novel section of the Japanese library has five kinds of complete illustrated editions of Song and Yuan Pinghua, one of which is the "Complete Illustrated Edition of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms Pinghua." It is the earliest blueprint for Luo Guanzhong's Romance of the Three Kingdoms. Each page of the book has illustrations in half a column and text in the lower half column. The Three Kingdoms stories recorded are very brief, and the sentences are not very smooth. It is generally a script of the storytellers at that time, and later illustrations were added and reprinted as a reading version. The illustrations used are all composed of straight lines, which are extremely rough. However, the rougher it is, the more ancient it looks in the eyes of those who are fond of antiquities. This novel has no extant copies in China and is a highly valuable ancient book. It is said that it was obtained from somewhere in the occupied area.

### Wuxi Is Filled with Poison Pills; The Puppet Magistrate Is Succeeded by Niu Yinmo

A dispatch from Wuxi: Everything is expensive in Wuxi. Even the opium sold in the "Hongji Shantang," which specializes in selling opium, costs more than 40 yuan per ounce. Ordinary opium smokers can't afford it and use white powder poison pills to satisfy their addiction. Poisonous substances take the opportunity to flow in, so the city has become a poisoned world.

Since the puppet magistrate Yang Chou Tong was assassinated, the vacancy has not been filled, and it is temporarily handled by the puppet secretary Tang Yong. Now, the puppet governor Chen Zemin has appointed Niu Yinmo, the secretary of the puppet police department, to take the position. Niu is from Hefei, Anhui Province. He had previously served as a magistrate in Shengxian, Jiashan, and Changxing in Zhejiang Province. In the 17th year of the Republic, he served as a section chief in the third section of the Shanghai Municipal Council. After the war, he held various puppet positions. This time, following the instructions of the Japanese side, he will come to Wuxi to take office.

### The Japanese Army in Changshu Forces the Puppet Government to Build Roads; A Passenger Ship Is Robbed in Hupu

A dispatch from Changshu: Hupu is an important area in the Yangtze River and is the gateway for Changshu's import and export goods. Since the Japanese monopolized Yangtze River shipping, foreign merchant ships have been under their control. The Japanese army has now negotiated with the puppet government to set a deadline for building the Hupu Highway to facilitate Japanese military and commercial transportation. All earthwork and forestry projects are ordered to be undertaken by the puppet government.

Water and land transportation in the countryside of Changshu has been plagued by accidents. The other day, the Li Min passenger ship was sailing from Shan Hupu to Dangkou. When it arrived at the Caomentang River surface, dozens of bandits suddenly came on a small boat and boarded the ship, searching all the passengers and accounting rooms. No one was spared, and more than 1,000 yuan was lost.

(A dispatch from Chongqing) Ba Hanzhang, a famous Confucian scholar from Xiangshan County, Zhejiang Province, was a student of the late Qing scholar Yu Qu. He was proficient in classics and history. Scholars at home and abroad, such as Zhang Taiyan, Liu Shipei, and Huang Jigang, all deeply respected him.

The Executive Yuan held its 452nd meeting on February 12 of this year and specially requested the National Government to issue an explicit commendation.

### Current Situation of Public Education Implementation in Zhejiang Province (4)

In non-war zone counties, in view of the scattered population, inconvenient transportation, and the urgent need for public education in the locality to promote the promotion of public education, 42 mobile schools have been set up one after another by referring to the methods in the war zone. In areas close to the war zone, the province has added 20 schools to the original 40 schools, and at the same time expanded to the war zone, with 40 schools established in Hangzhou and other places. Among them, 11 schools were temporarily suspended due to personnel relations or military impact. In the current year, there are 8 schools in the first semester and 88 schools in the second semester in the counties in the war zone, and 91 schools in the non-war zone. 60 provincial mobile schools in non-war zones continue to operate. Among the 40 schools in the war zone, except for 25 schools where there are no obstacles to promotion and are still teaching in the original place or relocated, the schools that have been suspended due to various difficulties are planned to be adjusted and to solve the difficulties. Regarding the short-term elementary schools in various counties, they are currently being promoted as usual. It was originally planned to open 1,897 schools and 2,344 classes in the 26th year of the Republic, but due to the outbreak of the war, the counties in the three prefectures of Zhaxi, Hangjia, and Hu successively fell, and the counties in eastern Zhejiang were affected by the military affairs, and the central and provincial public education funds were sharply reduced (the central government allocated 95.7% of the funds, 50% in October, and only one-third of the funds from November), and a part of the school and class methods stopped. After repeated urging, and by using the unspent funds from the fallen counties to make up for the discounts in the non-fallen counties, it was possible to restore normalcy. In the 27th year of the Republic, in addition to the counties in the war zone that have been converted into mobile schools, 1,613 short-term elementary schools and 1,123 classes have been established in 60 non-war zone counties, enrolling 181,552 out-of-school children. In this year, the number of short-term elementary schools that can be established has increased to 61 counties, and it is planned to establish 2,260 schools and classes, which are expected to accommodate 180,800 out-of-school children.

Therefore, our province adopts a two-pronged approach to the establishment of short-term elementary schools and mobile schools, and one-year short-term elementary schools have been piloted earlier in the 27th year of the Republic according to the needs of the actual environment, and it will not be difficult to implement them universally when the second phase of public education opens in the next year.

(2) Public education funds raised by the counties are distributed by the province as a whole. The public education funds raised by the counties in our province have mostly been allocated from the autonomous household donations since the 15th year of the Republic. At that time, due to the improper collection and management, malpractices were generated. In the 26th and 27th years of the Republic, due to the drastic military changes and the unstable political situation, it was difficult to thoroughly rectify them. By this year, the autonomous funds in our province have been changed to be统筹统支 under the land tax and ordinary business tax, with a total amount of 1.2 million yuan, of which 100,000 yuan has been designated as public education funds, which are allocated by this department in accordance with the actual needs of the counties in handling public education, so that the public education funds of all counties have a more solid source.

(3) Allocate public education funds to the counties in the war zone. The allocation of public education funds to the counties in the war zone was stopped after November of the 26th year of the Republic. Recently, schools have been gradually restored to accommodate out-of-school children separately, and the allocation should be continued to promote progress. In addition to the mobile schools run by the province, a special item of 22,080 yuan for the implementation of mobile education in the war zone was listed in the provincial education and cultural budget for the 27th year of the Republic, and 66,240 yuan was added in the 28th year of the Republic, but the amount is still not very large, and the needs of the counties in the war zone are even more urgent, so another 60,000 yuan has been allocated under the item of public education funds in this year, so that the compulsory education in the war zone can be revived.

### The Principals' Meeting of the Middle Schools of Various Churches in This City Discusses the Issue of Curriculum Compilation

The Chinese East China Christian Education Association in this city, in view of the fact that since the principals' meeting of various churches was held last year, there have been many unexpected gains and improvements in teaching, this term will continue to hold this meeting to improve teaching effectiveness, and assign Zhang Wenchang of Zhijiang High School to be responsible for presiding over it. According to Mr. Zhang, three meetings will be held this term. The first meeting will discuss how to compile the daily schedule, the second meeting will discuss the issue of student self-study guidance, and the third meeting will discuss the weaving of the registers in the teaching affairs office. It is learned that its first meeting has been held a few days ago, and representatives from more than 20 schools attended and jointly discussed the important issues of time allocation and teachers' weekly time for basic knowledge, practice, appreciation, self-study, and physical education, and also reported and investigated the daily schedules of 162 classes in 26 schools. It is said that the results are very satisfactory, and the 20 principles for compiling the daily schedule proposed by Mr. Zhang are very important, and are hereby recorded below for reference by the schools in this city: (1) The three units of time, place, and people must be taken into account at the same time. Use a large table for each unit. Write as you arrange, so as not to conflict. (2) Take into account the average labor and rest of teachers and students, and do not study continuously on the same day or half a day. (3) Make full use of school buildings and fields to achieve 60% or more of the benefit and quantity. (4) Administrative staff should not handle the first class in order to manage school affairs. (5) Arrange the special cases first, and then the easy-to-stick ones. If teachers have special reasonable requests, arrange them first. (6) The most efficient time is from 8:30 to 10:30 in the morning and from 2:00 to 3:00 in the afternoon, and the main subjects should be arranged. (7) The least efficient time is after 11:00 in the morning and from 1:00 to 2:00 in the afternoon and after 3:00, and the secondary subjects should be arranged. (8) There should be no gymnastics classes before or after meals. (9) After the physical education class, there should be no classes that use fine muscles (calligraphy, painting, typing, etc.). The practice class time should be short, the number of times should be many, and there should be regular intervals. (10) Physical education should be after 3:30. (11) In the other half of the day for half-day schools, there should be a self-study guide arrangement. (12) For full-day self-study guidance, there should be two to three sessions every day, plus two night classes, so there are four to five sessions of self-study every day, which can prepare for homework. (13) Extracurricular activities should be arranged in the schedule to improve the value of activities and make it easier for teachers and students to participate. (14) Please hire more full-time teachers to rationalize the daily schedule. (15) The elective courses should be combined into a group with different natures and arranged at the same time, which can reduce conflicts. (16) For the sake of responding to individuality, it is best to use the subject retention system and the ability grouping system, then the same subject should be taught at the same time, at least one group in each grade should be taught at the same time (the teachers must be different). (17) Full-time teachers should arrange 16 to 22 hours per week in high school and 18 to 24 hours in junior high school (the principal should take at least one-tenth of the time of the full-time teacher, and the director should take at least two-tenths of the time). The minimum is applicable to the main subjects and single groups, and the maximum is applicable to the secondary subjects, complex groups, and self-study guidance. (18) A 50-minute class in commercial high school is actually like a 45-minute class with a 5-minute break, but there should be a 10-minute break in the middle of the morning. If a complex class system is used, self-study guidance is best for 60 to 70 minutes, 40 minutes for class, and 20 to 30 minutes for self-study. (19) Save and make full use of the appropriate daily schedule of the previous semester.

### The Basketball Season Is Coming to an End; Qianghua and Huqing Will Hold a Charity Match

The current basketball season has come to an end in the invisible after the closing of the Chinese-Western Qing Invitational League. In the Western Qing League, Bailemen, a strong Chinese team, lost to Mai Hong by one point in the previous session, resulting in a disappointing result and finishing second. This session, renamed Qianghua, continued to participate. Thanks to the generals for their efforts, they defeated the strong enemies one after another. Fierce teams such as Mai Bai and Xiaoxiong all submitted. The rest of the teams were even more defeated at the sight of the wind. Since Hujiang University won the championship in 1928, the rest of the years have been dominated by Western teams. In this session, Qianghua raised its eyebrows and finally dominated, which is an unparalleled glory for the Chinese people. In the Chinese Qing League, Huqing broke through the bombing with two pairs in the finals and won the leader. Although Huqing is an emerging strong team, the players are all veterans of the battlefield, so they can defeat the enemy and overcome the heroes. Although Qianghua also participated in the Shi Chinese Qing League, it belongs to two departments and has no chance to meet. Fans regret it. It is learned that enthusiastic people in the sports world plan to invite the two heroes to perform a charity performance once, and all the income will be allocated to relief sales. Now they are soliciting consent from both parties, and they want to be righteous and courageous, and people are of the same mind, and it will definitely become a reality. At that time, a wonderful battle will definitely cause a sensation in Shanghai.

### Paramount Basketball Team - Victory Celebration Next Monday - Grand Tea Dance Social

The Paramount Athletic Association basketball team, since participating in the "Western Youth" tournament, narrowly missed the championship last year by a single point, failing to achieve their ambition of total victory. This year, although key players Cai Yanxiong and Zhou Dayun went to Yunnan, weakening their strength, they initially didn't plan to participate in the "Western Youth" tournament. However, due to the consecutive withdrawals of Da Xing and Lan Yi, and the urging of the organizers, they resolutely joined midway under the name of "Qiang Hua." After switching to attack, they were invincible, and all the Western teams surrendered. The "Western Youth" championship, which Chinese teams had never actually won in eleven years, was finally captured by Paramount, not only giving the Chinese teams a boost but also earning infinite glory for the Chinese. Such a grand event deserves celebration. The association's chairman, Mr. Gu Liancheng, has scheduled a grand tea dance social at the Paramount Ballroom at 5:00 PM on the 11th of this month (Monday) to celebrate. Members of all Shanghai Western basketball teams and celebrities from all walks of life have been invited to participate. All invitation cards will be sent out today.

### Sino-Foreign Charity Ping Pong Match - Preparatory Committee Meeting Tonight - 7 PM at Wanli Restaurant

### YMCA Continues to Hold Third Session - Women's Ping Pong Training Class

Since the Shanghai Table Tennis Association started to promote table tennis more than ten years ago, the sport has boomed, and its widespread development surpasses any other sport. However, women's table tennis has received little attention. Ms. He Xuchu, the sports director of the YMCA located at 995 Xiong'an Temple Road in this city, recognizing this, initiated a women's table tennis training class.

### Grain - Large Quantities of Foreign Rice to Arrive This Month - Rice Prices Falling Sharply - Speculators Hurriedly Selling

After the rice market declined again, the price fell sharply yesterday. According to industry insiders, a large number of futures contracts will arrive in port this month. When the supply increases and credit remains tight, people become nervous. Therefore, merchants are unwilling to push prices up, and shops are adopting a cautious approach, observing the situation. Even small speculators, who usually try to influence the market, are aware that the downward trend is unlikely to reverse in the short term. Therefore, they are trying to sell their large inventories, leading to price cuts at the opening of the market. Subsequently, goods originally held at higher prices are also being sold at lower prices, filling the market with talk of price drops. This makes merchants even more reluctant to buy, leading to a decline in sales. As prices fall more and more sharply, No. 1 Saigon, which opened at 46.5 yuan in the morning, has fallen to 46 yuan; Huojiao is at 44.5 yuan; Xiaojiao is at 41 yuan; and Tokyo Cijian is at 40.06 yuan and 40 yuan, a decrease of 1.5 yuan compared to the previous trading day. At this point, shops began to move slightly, and the market color showed some hesitation, but there was no change until closing. Market goods are less, which is more popular with the general public. Shopkeepers are paying close attention to meet the demand, so the market for broken rice suddenly boomed in the afternoon, and the price rebounded slightly, only about half a yuan compared to the previous trading day. The glutinous rice market is also sluggish, continuing its downward trend, falling by half a yuan. Thick and thin japonica rice and early and late indica rice and other domestic rice prices are displayed outside the market. It is heard that due to the decline in foreign rice, the source of supply from inland areas along the Chang Gong Road and Sujia Road has suddenly decreased, so yesterday it was reported that there was no delivery, but the 400-500 bags previously stored in the Hongkou district were still being sold.

After foreign rice continued to arrive in large quantities, there is still a lot of inventory in the market. Therefore, speculators are eager to sell, especially those who have made large profits and those with insufficient capital. Yesterday, after the exchange rate rose, the market also spread rumors that the quoted price of No. 1 Saigon had fallen to 56.5 yuan, and it was said that a small number of transactions had been made. Therefore, the market inevitably moved downwards. The spot price of foreign rice fell step by step in the morning, with the lowest price falling by nearly two yuan compared to the previous day. The prices of various goods in the general market fell by about one yuan, and futures also fell by more than one yuan. No. 2 Siam was only 50.03 yuan, and No. 2 Saigon was 50.08 yuan. Xiaojiao fell to 49.5 yuan. Importers were still slack, with only over 400 tons traded. There are currently only over 3,000 bags of foreign rice.

### Flour Market Weak Amid Export Ban Rumors

The flour market is showing signs of weakness. Since the news of the export ban spread the day before yesterday, people have become somewhat pessimistic. However, since the inventory of flour being resold is limited, holders are finding it difficult to sell even at low prices because exports have been blocked. Most are holding onto their goods, waiting for a better time to sell. Therefore, market transactions are limited to the "Xing Lao" brand. It is heard that the "Lao Che Pai" brand opened at 14.55 yuan and then fell to 14.45 yuan, down another one cent from before. Other brands are following the market trend. The price of No. 2 flour mill is still 10 yuan, limited to flat sales, with no surplus available for supply. 12,000 bags of flour will be shipped to Tianjin on the 7th.

The wheat market has once again reached a stalemate. Since it has been repeatedly reported from outside that Chinese factories have continued to order foreign wheat, factories are not keen to import and are trying to suppress prices. However, suppliers have no new sources, and although foreign wheat can be ordered, the price is around 30 yuan. At this time, between the old and new crops, holders are unwilling to sell lightly, resulting in a stalemate between the two sides. As a result, no formal transaction has been made.

### Miscellaneous Grains - Soybeans Fall by Another Yuan

Yesterday's soybean trading was relatively quiet. Although local oil factories and shops in inland cities continued to support the market, small speculators gradually sold off their holdings. The arrival of soybeans from various ports was endless, resulting in an oversupply situation, and the market became pessimistic. Yesterday's prices fell by another yuan. The overall market opened with over 1,000 bags of Wuhu Ping, priced at 10.05 yuan to 20.02 yuan; three cars of Nanjing beans were priced at 20.03 yuan to 19.03 yuan; four cars of Bengbu beans were priced at 22.05 yuan to 18.08 yuan; 130 bags of Yangzhou beans were priced at 18.05 yuan; and there were over 200 bags of Chongming Sand Yellow, priced at 21 yuan to 20.02 yuan.

Today, 300 bags of soybeans will be shipped to Little Luzon, and 3,324 bags will be shipped to Hong Kong; 12,023 pieces of soybean cake will be shipped to Little Luzon, and 1,850 cans of crude oil will be shipped to Hong Kong.

### Finance - British and American Exchange Markets Extremely Quiet

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation was quiet with HSBC quotes. Although it appeared slightly tight in the morning, the results were the same as the close of the previous night, and the current month was slightly stronger, because the Hong Kong telegraph was being sold. During the midday process, the morning opening of British reduced 0.015625, and American softened 0.03125, which was 4 pence 125 and 6 yuan 6875. Subsequently, the Hong Kong telegraph was being purchased, so it returned halfway. After entering the market, most buying and selling was on hold, and the market was deserted. Until closing, the spot price was unchanged, still 4 pence 0625 and 6 yuan 11875. The current month was slightly firmer, up 0.015625 and 0.02125 compared to the previous day, and the next month was no different.

At the same time, the opening of the futures was no different from the previous day. After the opening, the Hong Kong telegraph came to supply the market, so the market immediately returned to flat. It is estimated that the Hong Kong telegraph sold to HSBC and other spot British gold at 4 pence 140625, and at Siwen's time the spot American exchange also returned to 6 yuan 7, 875. Soon, foreign firms were doing business with each other, with the current month's American exchange at 6 yuan 65625. HSBC's published quotes remained unchanged, and the silver balance tax was announced down 1.5 cents. After that, trading was sluggish, and the market was extremely quiet. However, the current month's futures were slightly firmer because some Huabi firms and others were full of selling. It is estimated that Huabi sold the current month's American exchange to its counterparts at 6 yuan 6875, and later some firm also vomited the current month's American exchange to speculators, still at 6 yuan 6875. At that time, the current month's British gold also hardened to 4 pence 125 can be settled. After entering the market, there was even less buying and selling, and few transactions were heard. Until closing, British gold was 4 pence 140625, American exchange was 6 yuan 71875, the current month's British gold was 4 pence 25, American exchange was 6 yuan 6875, and the next month's British gold was 4 pence 0625, and American exchange was 6 yuan 5615.

### Speculators Continually Selling - Gold Market Lingering with Weakness

Yesterday's cash gold market situation was first falling, then rising, and finally falling again. The situation was that the foreign exchange had turned to this situation, and it was very willing to sell. As for the Hong Kong syndicate, they still came to absorb at low prices, so the whole day presented a lingering phenomenon. The morning opening was 4,780 yuan, calculated to be less than 10 yuan, because the gold shop first sold, and then Kuangye and others mutually searched, and the Hong Kong syndicate also came to operate during this period, so it once rose as high as 4,793 yuan. However, a certain bank and speculators and others took the opportunity to sell high, and a certain money changer also had a full intention to sell, extending to noon, and then fell to 4,780 yuan. The afternoon close was 4,781 yuan. In the early afternoon, a certain bank recovered the speculators' sell-off, once being pressed down to 4,776 yuan. Fortunately, the Hong Kong syndicate saw the cheapness and re-absorbed, so until the close, it rose as high as 4,782 yuan. As a result, it still fell 8 yuan compared to the previous day. The entire day's trading decreased sharply, about 700 taels. Silver jewelry shops did not change, and customs gold, etc., were still flat.

Spot Gold Down by Eight Yuan

A certain gold shop sold 40 taels to a certain bank, for 4,780 yuan. A short time later, money changers suddenly came to drag it in, and the gold shop's buying and selling turned weak, so it gradually rose by 12 yuan. The jewelry shop syndicate did 20 taels with each other, for 4,792 yuan. Subsequently, because the jewelry shop syndicate frequently sold and the gold shop also sold, it fell again by 7 yuan. A money changer delivered 50 taels to the securities syndicate, for 4,785 yuan. Then the money changer's buying intentions became stronger, and the securities syndicate also made gains, and it rose again by 8 yuan. The jewelry shop syndicate sold 30 taels to the money changer, for 4,793 yuan. Finally, because a certain bank suddenly sold again on behalf of speculators, and a certain money changer had stopped absorbing, coupled with the fact that a certain securities syndicate and another money changer also followed suit and sold, it fell again by 13 yuan. The securities syndicate did 50 taels with each other, for 4,780 yuan. Then the jewelry shop syndicate sold 10 taels to a cash gold shop, for 4,781 yuan as the noon closing price.

In the afternoon, it fell to 14 yuan and 6 cents and 7 minutes. On Wednesday afternoon, there was no foreign exchange market, and the currency market was very flat.

### Securities - Domestic Debt Dismal - Foreign Stocks Improve

The securities gray market was even more sluggish yesterday, with one cent heard to be hovering around. Although Category B was approaching the lottery draw, it was also lifeless. The news was dull, and people's minds were scattered, causing both bulls and bears to be in a state of hesitation. Throughout the day, general buying and selling accounts, bulls may have added positions, and bears may have slightly closed positions, or they may have exited B and entered C, or they may have entered first and then exited, but there was no larger appetite. Therefore, the results of the day were mixed, with the total number of transactions being approximately 500,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.

Stock trading: Thirty shares of Sanyou Industrial Company were traded, at a price of 25 yuan each.

Yesterday, the stock market of the Zhongye Public Institute returned to a better state.

### Yarn and Cotton - Cotton Yarn Bottom Has Been High - There Are Many Who Dump

The yarn market has risen again, and the trend is still gentle. In fact, the bottom has been high, and the actual digestion is not very smooth, so considering the cotton yarn itself, it can be calm. However, the general speculators' minds are looking high, and they are still enthusiastic. This is because the future of the exchange market is mostly difficult to be long, so they are unwilling to give up the goods in hand.

The current yarn opened in the morning, because the foreign exchange rate reduced on the previous day, people's hearts were moved, and the buying atmosphere was enthusiastic. The public flocked in, rising by 10 yuan. The price of 20-count Shuangma March futures was 917 yuan, but the spot trading was as cold as ice, and the transaction was very small. It was then heard that the foreign exchange market opened without major changes and was as stable as usual. The market price did not see a large up and down, slightly falling to 14 yuan. The bulls advanced again, and it rose to 920 yuan again, but there were more sellers at high prices. The closing price was 912 yuan. In the afternoon, the spot price rose by 10 yuan.

Another message: Foreign cotton market price, New York cotton market has turned lively again in recent days. In the early morning of yesterday, it was slightly up by 15 pounds due to the purchase of speculators. Later, due to the purchase of the same industry and a part of the empty hearing to make up, the closing price, the recent term rose by eight or nine pounds, and the distant term rose by thirteen or fourteen pounds. The Indian cotton market has been over four robis in recent days, and Egypt has also risen by ten pounds.

The Shanghai foreign cotton trading has been quite brisk in recent days. Because there is not much inventory in the market, the recent arrivals are all factory prices, and the yarn prices have been rising in recent days, and the industry intends that the cotton prices will rise sharply. Therefore, they have been vigorously searching and buying in the market in recent days, so people's hearts are very good. Although there is no transaction by the factory, there are many inquiries. The cotton market yesterday was converted to a factory price of 6 yuan 6875 for American exchange rates as follows:

A large batch of American cotton came to Shanghai, the American General Eglantine (transliteration) number, transported more than 7,900 pieces of American cotton from San Francisco, arrived at Wusongkou yesterday, and is expected to be imported this morning. It is planned to stop at Qichang Wharf in Pudong to unload. The English-owned Silveraeak, managed by the Zhahua Company, also transported 2,000 tons of cotton from the United States, originally scheduled to arrive in port today (7th), but as of last night, the company had not received a telegram from the ship, and it is expected to arrive in Shanghai today or tomorrow.

### Miscellaneous - German Pigments - Will Change the Way to Transport to Shanghai Said - The Market Has Turned Loose

Most of the pigments come from Germany. Since the outbreak of the European War, the Shanghai sales houses have been afraid of import blockages, causing market prices to rise step by step, showing a prosperous trend. Compared with before the European War, it has risen by 6/10 or even more than doubled. Recently, according to people in the industry, in order to expand trade, Germany has changed the way to import various pigments, and the market has returned to looseness. Because there are many sources of goods in Su and Xi, and sales are sluggish, the market is gradually becoming soft.

### Imports and Exports - Tea and Tobacco Leaves Arrive in Shanghai - A Large Amount of Cotton Cloth Is Transported to South China

### Silk and Tea - February New York Raw Silk Statistics

The New York silk market has not been good in recent months, and the numbers of raw silk imports, storage, and sales are still gradually decreasing. Therefore, the silk price has been fluctuating in January. In March, New York's raw silk imported 1,356 yuan and 6 corners, a decrease of 19,555 dans, and sales were 3,485 dans, a decrease of 7,021 dans. Looking at a single number, it is still in a state of depression, which is the only thing seen in the spring of previous years. The factors may be related to the war in Europe. At the same time, it was reported that the American new man-made silk "Nalong" has been produced in large quantities by the New York Esbon Company, so raw silk will be facing a strong rival again. Some people say that the recent shrinkage of New York's raw silk import and sales numbers is affected by the termination of the Japan-US trade treaty, which is not in line with the facts. We know that American munitions and gasoline are still being transported to Japan, and in fact, it can be known that the abandonment of the treaty has not had much impact on the upcoming Japan-US trade. The following is the New York raw silk statistics for the month:

### North-South Goods: Mandarin Cakes Scarce, Prices Rise by One or Two Yuan

Mandarin cakes have recently been arriving in short supply. However, sales have been somewhat active, so the previously arrived goods that had not been opened for sale are now rising by one or two yuan. For example, large red Suzhou cakes are selling in the market for 55 yuan, and soft cakes for 54.5 yuan. If sales continue to be strong, a tight supply is expected.

### Medicinal Materials: Lily Bulbs Rise by Two or Three Yuan

According to recent reports from the producing areas, there are only a little over 500 pieces of lily bulbs left. Since the beginning of spring, due to sluggish sales, the market has been quite flat. Generally, hoarders are taking a wait-and-see attitude. It is reported that the local wholesalers still have sufficient stock. Recently, a comprador from Hong Kong took a batch, which caused the price to rise by two or three yuan compared to the previous market price.

### Textiles: Summer Woolens Already Being Purchased by Local Merchants

Yesterday's woolen transactions showed good progress. Tailor shop business has increased sharply, and the retail tailoring business of woolen cloth, silk and satin, and Western clothing shops has also been thriving daily. Summer woolens such as feather yarn wool, barracan, Panné velvet, ramie canvas, white drill, white straight tribute (silk), "Wan Ding" brand, and yellow twill fabrics are being sold earlier than in previous years. This is because merchants from all regions are afraid that market prices will rise further in the future, so they are rushing to purchase them.

Rubber

New York Telegraph of the 5th: Rubber consumption in February was equal to imports. However, this was offset by the increase in goods at sea. The report that the British Far East import price is higher than that of the United States may be the reason for the scarcity and high prices here. There is a lack of consensus, and outside interest is weak. Rubber imports from outside Malaya in February totaled 16,58 tons, compared to 30,141 tons last month. Total estimated rubber exports from Malaya in February accounted for 3,000 tons.

### The Northern District Becomes a World of Terror: Japanese Troops Seize Laborers for Forced Labor; No Safe Place Left in the Open Area; Chinese Who Go There Are Like Fish in a Net; Western Newspapers Detail the Facts and Describe the Conditions of Forced Labor

The North-China Daily News reports: Since the recent reopening of the area north of the Suzhou Creek and the permission for Chinese to enter, rumors have spread that the Japanese side is dispatching labor squads to seize young Chinese men in the Zhabei, Hongkou, Huishan, and Yangshupu districts at dawn and at night, and to force them to work in Pudong and other places. Although the Japanese spokesperson in this city has repeatedly denied this, the North-China Daily News received confirmation yesterday (the 5th) and learned the details of several forced abduction incidents, proving that the fear felt by the general Chinese population is not without reason. This feeling has already been reflected in Chinese newspapers.

Hundreds Confined in a Certain Location in Pudong: Many of the Chinese men who are seized suddenly disappear without a trace. Some Chinese men were fortunate enough to avoid the labor squads and witnessed their unfortunate compatriots falling into the hands of the abductors. One coolie, who was taken to a labor camp in Pudong and held under the guard of armed Japanese and Chinese watchmen, lived in the camp with hundreds of other seized people. He managed to escape and recounted his experience.

Northern District Thrown into a Panic: Young Chinese men, including those who are married and have families to support, are being seized. These actions have caused panic in the northern district, making Chinese afraid to return there. It is said that factory workers, deliverymen, and others who have business dealings with Beihai now refuse to go to the northern district, and male servants living in Beihai fear going out, especially at night.

Abductions Everywhere, Hard to Avoid: Abductions have occurred near the bridges over the Suzhou Creek, in various locations in the northern district, at the Hongkou vegetable market, near the North Station, and near large factories. Therefore, it seems that there is no safe place in the reopened area. A few cases of forced abduction are recorded below: (1) At 5:30 AM on Sunday, which was forty minutes before sunrise, a Chinese man was walking along Peng Road near the intersection of North Sichuan Road when he saw three people stopping a number of Chinese laborers and forcing three of them to go with them. One of the abducted Chinese workers struggled vigorously but could not escape. The Chinese man who witnessed the event could not determine whether the abductors were Chinese, Korean, or Japanese.

One Man Shot While Fleeing: (2) The day before, a Chinese man was walking west of the North Station when he was forcibly seized by four Japanese soldiers who tried to take him to a labor camp. The Chinese man struggled to escape and was shot at, sustaining minor injuries, but he still managed to escape to safety. He then went to the south bank of the Suzhou Creek and sought treatment at a hospital in the city the next morning. He had two bullet wounds in his leg and is still in the hospital. He has reported the details of his experience to the city authorities. Previously, foreigners had also seen young Chinese men with their hands tied behind their backs being taken near the North Station.

A Youth Escapes by Leaping onto a Bus: (3) Several days before the above-mentioned Chinese man was shot, a young Chinese man was walking near Yangshupu Road and Taopeng Road when he was stopped by two men wearing Western clothes who spoke Japanese. They ordered the young man to go to a covered truck parked nearby. He saw another Chinese man being forcibly pushed into the truck. At that moment, a bus stopped at the corner of the road. The young man quickly boarded the bus and then looked back at the truck parked by the roadside. He saw that the truck was already carrying twenty or thirty Chinese men. He was fortunate to have boarded the bus and escaped.

Guns Used for Intimidation, Hands Tied Tightly: (4) A married young Chinese man who worked in a factory and lived in the Huishan district was stopped by a Japanese soldier at 5:00 AM on February 15 on Liaoyang Road. He was taken to a nearby Japanese military post. When he showed signs of resistance, the Japanese soldier intimidated him with a gun. Half an hour later, the Japanese soldier tied his hands and, along with forty other Chinese men, took him to a wharf in the eastern district. They boarded a large ship, which was towed by a steamer to the shore in Pudong. After walking for two hours, they arrived at a camp surrounded by barbed wire.

Building Roads Under Supervision: Outside the camp were a few Japanese soldiers and a large number of Chinese police watching. The young man estimated that there were already fifty conscripted laborers in the camp before they arrived. The next morning, they were all taken out to build roads under supervision. They returned to the camp in the evening, and the food was good, but they did not receive a penny for their hard labor. After a week, he and several others escaped in the dark and eventually reached the bank of the Huangpu River. The young man entered the concession last week, exhausted, and is now being treated in a hospital south of the Suzhou Creek.

One Man Was Abducted and Taken to Nanjing: (5) A young Chinese man was abducted at the northern end of the Waibaidu Bridge two weeks ago and taken to Nanjing to perform hard labor. He has sent a letter to his relatives reporting his whereabouts and is believed to still be in Nanjing. (6) Another Chinese man was forcibly abducted near the Zhabei Road Bridge on a road in Hongkou on February 25, and his whereabouts have not yet been discovered.

### Many Women Arrested

The English-language "China Press" reports: Today (6th) according to news from the Suzhou Creek northern district, in the past three weeks the Japanese authorities have arrested many Chinese, including Chinese women in the western districts of Hongkou and Yangshupu. The exact number of Chinese women arrested is unknown, and after being arrested, they are never seen or heard from again. According to the Japanese explanation, these women are doing laundry and cooking for the soldiers, but their true fate is unknown. It is heard that the total number of Chinese women abducted is one-third of the number of Chinese men arrested in the past three weeks. It is now heard that after the men are seized, they are taken to Wenzaobang and other places to build roads and dredge rivers. According to Chinese sources, the Japanese are "recruiting" laborers in the northern district of Suzhou Creek rather than forcibly conscripting them in the countryside because they fear that the laborers they seize may be mixed with

guerrillas. In the past few months, the Japanese authorities have learned several lessons. Chinese guerrillas have disguised themselves as "workers" and infiltrated Japanese-held areas, leading guerrilla attacks. According to newspapers, although previous reports of conscription in the northern district did not specify that it was carried out by the Japanese Marine Corps, the Japanese

spokesperson denied that the Japanese Marine Corps was forcibly conscripting Chinese people at a press conference on Sunday. However, the Japanese army has not yet denied this. It is known that the conscription incidents occurred in the northern district of the Public Concession, which is under the control of the Japanese Navy, but the Japanese Marine Corps has not yet announced any action to stop the conscription. According to the Japanese-language "Continental New Daily," the Japanese Consulate Police Department, the Japanese Defense Forces of the Public Concession, the Japanese Military Police, and the "Shanghai Municipal Government" will take action to stop the false rumors that Chinese people in Hongkou are being abducted and taken to Taiwan. These rumors are related to the activities of anti-Japanese groups.

### Foreign Ratepayers' Annual Meeting Scheduled for April 17; Election of Councilors Also Scheduled

The election of councilors for the Shanghai Municipal Council for the municipal year 1940, as well as the election of one property commissioner for the said year by the registered landowners in the Public Concession, have been officially announced by the Municipal Council to be held on Wednesday, April 10 and Thursday, April 11 of this year. Ballots must be delivered to the office of the Municipal Council at 209 Jiangxi Road, the General Office of the Council, no later than 12:00 noon on Tuesday, April 2 of this year, to be received by the Secretary-General and Registrar of the Council. The annual meeting of foreign ratepayers for this year is scheduled to be held on Wednesday, April 17 at 2:30 PM. Furthermore, the Council's gazette states that any ratepayer with voting rights who wishes to obtain the English-language annual report of the Council for the previous year may write to the Secretary-General and Registrar of the Council at 209 Jiangxi Road, with the word "Annual Report" marked on the envelope.

### Seaning Foreign Firm Labor Strike Settled; All to Resume Work on the 8th; Rice Allowance Principle Accepted by Management

The Zhaofeng Road factory of the American-owned Seaning Foreign Firm, which employs 270 Chinese workers, experienced a work slowdown at noon on the [unclear character] day due to demands for improved treatment and a shuttle service for workers. Initially, the firm's manager, Seaning Sheng, went to the factory to negotiate with the

workers, but they talked until dawn without reaching an agreement, leading to a worsening of the slowdown. Subsequently, the workers petitioned the Industrial Section of the Municipal Council for assistance. Gu Bingyuan, the mediation director of the section, mediated between the firm's manager, Seaning Sheng, Chinese manager Wang Xifan, and worker representatives at 3:00 PM yesterday, obtaining the consent of both labor and management.

An agreement was announced: (1) The management, in principle, accepted the workers' demand for a rice allowance; (2) The management agreed to the request that workers not be dismissed without cause; (3) The management canceled the shuttle service for workers and will formulate new measures; (4) The case of White Russian staff oppressing workers will be handled by a personnel committee organized by the management; (5) Fines levied on workers will be used for worker welfare; (6) Workers will return to work on the 8th. It is reported that all workers at the factory have decided to resume work on the morning of the 8th (Friday).

### Rice Prices Continue to Fall; Market Sales Reported Daily; Speculators Mostly Selling

Market sales are reported daily; speculators are mostly selling. Since the authorities of the two concessions strictly ordered rice merchants to report daily sales, 89 rice firms in the market have complied, submitting reports daily. Yesterday's transactions totaled 2,772 bags, compared to 1,242 bags the day before. As for rice prices, due to the large influx of foreign rice and the impact of sales at lower prices, sales have sharply decreased, and prices are falling daily. Yesterday, superior rice grades fell by varying amounts up to one yuan. If this situation continues, prices can be expected to return to normal. It is reported that speculators profiting from rice have recently felt the pressure of public opinion and are shifting their attention to cotton cloth trading, which is the main reason for the price decline.

### Further Meeting; Selection of Chinese Committee Members; Officially Announced

The Continental Daily reported on the 5th that the Price Equalization Committee organized last month by the French authorities in this city to curb rising prices will hold another meeting tomorrow (the 7th) at 5:00 PM at the French Consulate. According to informed sources, when the committee held its first plenary meeting last Thursday, it formed three subcommittees to investigate fuel, rice, other food, and general living conditions in the French Concession. These subcommittees will submit reports to the Price Equalization Committee tomorrow. The French Consulate officially announced the following Chinese members of the committee: Yao Zhongba (Director of Xinhe Yarn Factory), Wan Molin (Manager of Wanchang Rice Firm), Lu Gaoyi (Member of the Price Equalization Committee), Jin Zhixuan (Director of Sida Iron Factory), and Qi Zhi (Chinese Director of the French Municipal Council). The Price Equalization Subcommittee organized by the Shanghai Municipal Council is also busy compiling reports to be submitted to the Municipal Council within a few days.

### Draft Restrictions on Shanghai-Ningbo Vessels; Shipping Industry Eager for Relaxation; In Light of the Jing Sheng Tugboat Tragedy; Relevant Parties Are Considering

Since the sinking of the Ningbo tugboat Jing Sheng, various parties have been discussing ways to improve Shanghai-Ningbo shipping. The Ningbo Shipping Administration is considering new measures for direct Shanghai-Ningbo shipping. Salvage operations for the Jing Sheng shipwreck began the day before yesterday. The following is a continuation of the reports:

Considering Measures for Direct Shanghai-Ningbo Shipping

After the Jing Sheng tragedy, the Ningbo Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai telegraphed the Ningbo Shipping Administration Office and the Shipping Management Office, requesting that navigation be facilitated without hindering military affairs and that ships be strictly inspected to ensure they are seaworthy and can pass without obstruction. According to inquiries made yesterday by a New Voice News reporter to the shipping industry in this city, the Ningbo Shipping Administration is actively planning to improve navigation. In order to shorten the voyage and facilitate commercial transport, it is necessary to universally implement direct shipping through the mud flats of Ningbo. However, after the blockade of Zhenhai Port, the navigation route has become winding, and vessels with excessive draft cannot enter the blockade line. Therefore, it is necessary to set standards first to ensure safe navigation. The previously set standard of a draft of 12 feet or less for vessels entering Zhenhai Port seems to be too strict. Methods for relaxing the restriction are currently being considered. According to calculations based on the current draft depths of vessels on the Shanghai-Zhenhai route, if the restriction can be relaxed, at least more than half of the ships could sail directly to Ningbo. Ships such as the Hana Baoli, Haifufu, Feikang, and Ruitai could all sail directly.

Salvage Operations for Jing Sheng Shipwreck Underway

Regarding the Jing Sheng shipwreck, it was learned yesterday that the Aftermath Committee is conducting salvage operations, using ropes and anchors to secure the sunken ship. However, because the ship is too heavy, the ropes and anchors have broken, resulting in the failure of the first salvage attempt. The diver hired in Shanghai recently arrived in Ningbo and will work with local salvage personnel to continue salvaging the ship and bodies. It was also learned that more than 500 pieces of luggage have been retrieved, some of which have been claimed by family members.

### Various Steamships Encounter Heavy Fog; Import Delays; Large Quantities of Cotton and Motor Oil Shipped to Shanghai; Java Ship Also Bringing Rice to Shanghai

The recent inclement weather and heavy fog at sea have caused considerable difficulties for navigation, resulting in delays for ships arriving at port. The Italian Postal Steamship Company's regular mail ship, the Kangniluosuo, originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai today, has been delayed due to heavy fog. According to the ship's telegram, it departed from Hong Kong at 6:00 PM yesterday and is expected to arrive at Wusong Port on the evening of tomorrow (the 8th) and enter the port on the morning of the 9th, docking at the Gonghexang Wharf in Hongkou. It is reported that

there are 967 passengers. The US President Lines, newly chartered Norwegian ships, and various ships of the US Vanguard Company, are opening up the US-China-Philippines route. The first cargo ship, the Norwegian ship Eglaunteiue, loaded with a large quantity of cotton (approximately 7,900 pieces) from San Francisco, is expected to enter the port at approximately 8:00 AM this morning due to heavy fog, docking at the Gonghe Wharf in Hongkou for unloading. The British ship Silueraeak, managed by the Java Postal Steamship Company, is carrying a large quantity of

cotton and motor oil from the United States, originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai today, is also affected by the fog. As of yesterday evening, there was no confirmed time of arrival in Shanghai. According to the Java Company, it is expected to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow or the day after. Furthermore, the company's ship Safoluotuo, carrying rice from Saigon, was scheduled to arrive in port today but will now arrive tomorrow.

### Coal Industry Orders Large Quantities of Coal; Transaction Prices Have Decreased; Market Conditions Are Also Stabilizing

In order to increase coal reserves and balance supply and demand, coal merchants in this city have telegraphed coal-producing regions such as India, Annam, and Cuba to order large quantities of

anthracite and bituminous coal. (1) Anthracite includes Hongji, Haifeng, Mac, Yuedong, Cuba, New Hongji, and Hebei (Liujiang); (2) Bituminous coal includes Indian lump waste, Kaiping (Kai'ao), No. 1 screened lump, No. 2 lump waste, household lump, train lump, special waste, No. 1 waste, No. 2 waste, Changxing lump waste, and Vietnamese lump waste. It is understood that this coal is of excellent quality and that transaction prices are lower than those of last month. Various purchasers are making efforts to load ships to transport the coal to Shanghai to regulate the market and supply sales. Moreover, major coal merchants already feel overstocked and have no intention of adding more, so the market price of coal has been

gradually declining in recent days. It is clear that the cost of coal briquettes has decreased significantly. The four million citizens of the city sincerely hope that relevant organizations will jointly persuade the coal briquette manufacturers to lower the market price by stopping the sale of coal briquettes at non-fair prices. The Shanghai Machine-Made Coal Briquette Industry Association has stated that it is willing to continue selling coal briquettes at fair prices under the leadership of various public organizations to benefit the common people, which is truly commendable. It is reported that after receiving a letter from the association, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce decided to request that Mr. Yu Qiaqing promptly negotiate a reduction in water transport fees. Furthermore, according to inquiries made by a New Voice News reporter, firewood and charcoal produced in Wenzhou and Taizhou, Zhejiang, are being continuously transported to Shanghai from Wenzhou and Zhenhai by ship. Therefore, the market price of various fuels in Shanghai has stabilized. Once coal transport fees are reduced, the selling prices of anthracite, bituminous coal, and coal waste will inevitably fall.

### Wartime News

According to the overseas correspondence section of the January 20th issue of the American Medical Association Journal (A.M.A. Journal), during World War I, approximately 400,000 British soldiers contracted venereal diseases, mostly gonorrhea. This greatly reduced combat effectiveness, as soldiers with venereal diseases were allowed to retreat to the rear and be treated in venereal disease hospitals. As a result, soldiers on leave often deliberately contracted gonorrhea to avoid returning to the front lines. Prostitutes with gonorrhea often enticed soldiers to have intercourse, claiming they could contract gonorrhea and retreat to the rear. Some even inoculated themselves with the excrement of women with gonorrhea to contract the disease. Therefore, the warring countries in the European War have changed their methods. Except for syphilis and severe complications, treatment is now administered at the front. Currently, Colonel B.L. Ank, a venereal disease specialist, is responsible for treatment in the United Kingdom. It is said that Germany has adopted Dr. Adina's "Mathexin" as a special drug for treating gonorrhea.

### Courts Will Not Accept Exchange Rate Premiums for Debt; Finance Ministry Orders Further Crackdown on Silver Shops to Prevent Speculation and Suppress Prices

The Ministry of Finance previously announced measures to stabilize finance and restrict withdrawals, originally intended to stabilize the market and prevent the outflow of funds. However, since the practice of exchange rate premiums emerged, all remittances could be converted into cash, and speculation in foreign exchange was rampant, with exchange rate premiums reaching their highest levels. This shows where the cash obtained from exchange rate premiums is being used. If remittances were to abolish exchange rate premiums, speculation would be curbed to some extent. When exchange rate premiums first emerged, it was often because importers, after selling foreign goods, could not purchase foreign exchange with the remittances they received, so they discounted the price to obtain cash and engage in foreign exchange purchases. If there were no exchange rate premiums, those who wanted to convert remittances into foreign exchange would have to use the remittances to purchase domestic goods and export them abroad, which would encourage increased exports. The existence of exchange rate premiums and the outflow of funds does not lead to the benefit of exporting domestic goods. On the contrary, it serves as a tool for speculating in foreign exchange and foreign goods. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance, recognizing this deeply, has ordered the four major banks (Central, China, Communications, and Agricultural) and the Shanghai Silver Shop Association to strictly crack down on exchange rate premiums for the purpose of stopping speculation, suppressing prices, and securing the livelihood of the people. It is reported that courts will not accept any debts involving exchange rate premiums in the future.

### Municipal Council Plans to Increase Taxes; Impacts People's Livelihoods Significantly; Likely to Stimulate Continued Price Increases; Rent Disputes Will Inevitably Follow; Shanghai Federation Sends Letter to Ratepayers Association to Negotiate a Stop

The Shanghai First Special District Citizens Federation sent a letter to the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Public Concession yesterday, stating: "We are writing to you regarding reports from various district associations of this federation (37, 11, 2, 20, 26, 12, 24, 35, 34, 21, etc.) (the original content has been published in the newspapers), etc. In this regard, it has been noted that the Municipal Council has announced that it intends to

increase taxes again by 50% starting July 1st of this year, causing an uproar in domestic and foreign public opinion. It is widely believed that this action by the Municipal Council will further deepen the crisis in the market. The Municipal Council should, at this juncture, share the difficulties with taxpayers and reduce municipal expenditures to the

lowest level, eliminating unnecessary expenses as much as possible to respect the hard-earned money of taxpayers. It is remembered that before the war, the Municipal Council planned to increase taxes by 1% (from 14% to 16%), but all sectors protested strongly, claiming it would be unbearable, and the implementation was eventually postponed. Now, in this time of war, abnormal prices, and economic hardship for the people, the sudden desire to increase taxes by 50% is truly

sucking the marrow from the bones. Once implemented, it will inevitably stimulate continued price increases and rent disputes, plunging society into serious unrest. We have always admired your association as a leading organization for taxpayers. We sincerely hope that you will quickly negotiate a stop to this matter."

### Local Climate is Bad; The Sky is Unusually Gloomy

Since a spring snowfall, the local climate has been deteriorating, with intermittent overcast skies and rain. The darkness was even worse yesterday morning, with the daytime resembling dusk. Spring fog was pervasive, with fog connecting the areas along the Huangpu River, making it difficult to distinguish people within dozens of feet. Navigation was hindered. In recent days, the local area has experienced warm northwest to northeast winds, so the climate is still relatively warm, with temperatures above 40 degrees Fahrenheit throughout the day. According to inquiries made by a Datong News Agency reporter to the Observatory, since the 1st of this month, there has been continuous spring rain, totaling 27.0 centimeters of rainfall, resulting in extremely humid weather.

### Japanese Posts Suddenly Withdraw from the Nanshi "Safety Zone"

After the departure of the Kikuchi Unit of the Japanese Army in Nanshi, the Ochishima Unit took over, with the guard posts inside and outside the city remaining the same. It is now known that, for some unknown reason, the guard posts north of the security line were all removed yesterday morning. Within the so-called "Safety Zone," not a single soldier can be seen. Only at the four entrances where the iron gates connect with the French Concession is there a military policeman guarding each entrance. Otherwise, there are only unarmed "Avenue Police." At the same time, news has been spread by relevant parties that the "Citizen's Certificate" will be tentatively abolished on the 15th to facilitate its attempt to "prosper" the market.

### Portuguese Merchant Ship Minhe Sails to Shanghai for the First Time; Released After Mooring in Wenzhou for Over a Year

The Portuguese merchant ship Minhe, of the Universal Navigation Company, has been moored in Wenzhou port for over a year. Recently, it obtained the approval of the Wenzhou-Taizhou Defense Headquarters. On the 25th of last month, it loaded passengers and cargo in Wenzhou and sailed to Shanghai. It was detained and inspected by Japanese warships outside Wenzhou port. After repeated negotiations by the shipowner, it was released after being detained for four days. It is now known that the ship arrived in Shanghai the night before last and is docked at the Roosevelt Wharf at the 16th Pier. After the cargo is loaded and unloaded, it will continue to sail to Wenzhou.

### Banks Will Charge Fees for Safekeeping of Customer Documents Starting Today

The Shanghai Banking Association and the Shanghai Foreign Exchange Banking Association jointly announced yesterday: "For public notice, it has been resolved by both associations that all member banks will charge safekeeping and handling fees for various property documents held in safekeeping or with a lien, starting March 7, 1930. Detailed regulations can be obtained from member banks."

### Gunfire in West Shanghai Last Night; False Officials Open Fire on Each Other

At around 10:00 PM last night, a case of false "soldiers" and false "detectives" opening fire on each other occurred in the gangster area of Kangnaotuo Road in West Shanghai. It originated from a false "agency" set up in Meicun, Kangnaotuo Road, with guards posted at the entrance and strict security. After nightfall, patrol teams were sent to patrol the area. At around 10:00 PM last night, three or four false "detectives" walked into a certain place and passed by the "agency." The "guards" there became suspicious upon seeing their strange behavior and decided to search them. Unexpectedly, the false "detectives" thought they had encountered bandits and drew their guns, opening fire. The false "guards" also returned fire. The two sides exchanged fire in the darkness for a long time. It was discovered after they identified each other that several people had been injured. Afterward, the false "detectives" who had started the incident were apprehended for interrogation.

### Women's Integrity Society Commemorates "March 8th" Women's Day; Addressed to Female Compatriots in Shanghai

Since the Copenhagen Conference in Denmark in 1909 decided on March 8th as International Women's Day, it has become a day for women around the world to reflect on the past, strive for liberation, and open up a new life for the future. In China, where cannons roar, blood flowers fly, and resistance is unyielding today, commemorating International Women's Day has especially great significance in practicing struggle and transforming the era. In fact, what is worth considering glorious is that in these three years of resistance, we have countless female warriors and female compatriots who endure hardship, traverse dangers, and tirelessly strive to recover lost territory day and night. They have definitely fulfilled a part of their responsibility for recruiting, relief, comfort, rescue, propaganda, education, battlefield service, childcare, and participating in various production departments. In the war of resistance, they have not only undertaken the revolutionary task of the Three Principles of the People, but also the women's movement has gained opportunities for growth and development from this time, gaining new understanding and new strength in practical activities. The future harvest is limitless, and the future of China is bright. In addition to expressing our infinite respect to these tens of thousands of patriotic female compatriots, we offer a few suggestions to our sisters remaining in Shanghai:

Since Shanghai fell, because of the darkness and hardship of the environment, most women have not only failed to shoulder the sacred mission of saving the country, but have even become increasingly despondent and degenerate due to psychological anxiety, repeating their muddled and corrupt lives. This is very regrettable. It must be known that although Shanghai has fallen temporarily, it is still the territory of the Republic of China, and we should urge it to return to the embrace of the motherland as soon as possible. Although the isolated island is surrounded, we must use our greatest efforts to quickly clear all the clouds of sorrow. Of course, this does not mean that every woman has to pick up a gun and charge into battle, or go to the front lines to serve, but rather that everyone has their own position, and we must try our best to integrate our position with the war of resistance. We must also understand that the work of resisting the war and building the country is multifaceted. Holding a weapon to defend the country is certainly a revolutionary warrior, but engaging in other work and activities that are conducive to the war of resistance is also a revolutionary warrior. Currently, the three most urgent and necessary things are:

(1) Firmly establish the will to resist the war, not to be shaken by any temptation, not only must we have the determination to die unyielding, but we must also constantly advise our fathers, brothers, husbands, relatives and friends not to approach or even betray us because of deception or threats.

(2) Eliminate illiteracy, improve the general cultural level of women, and at the same time inspire their initiative and train their political knowledge and ability to prepare for the implementation of constitutional government. This is the responsibility that women cannot delay.

(3) Strengthen the movement for frugality, which can not only change the bad habits of extravagance, but also increase their own self-cultivation and directly and indirectly benefit the country. We should use all the money wasted on decorations, gambling, banquets, and superstitions to contribute to the government, comfort the soldiers on the front lines, relieve poor chicks, or other social welfare undertakings.

In short, in the stage of the war of resistance approaching victory, Shanghai women can only save the motherland with the spirit of struggle and progress in order to complete the task of national liberation and their own liberation.

### Merchants Can Still Apply for False Exit Permits from Ningbo

The Yin County Government Military Service Section has found that in recent times, an increasing number of young men of military age are applying for exit permits under the guise of handling affairs, which has a significant impact on military service. Yesterday, it submitted a request to the County Magistrate to impose restrictions. It is reported that County Magistrate Yu is still considering the restrictive measures after receiving the request. Therefore, the rumor that the issuance of exit permits to merchants has been temporarily suspended is not yet a fact.

### Suspect in the Shooting of Liu Zhongying Granted Extension of Detention

Regarding the case of Liu Zhongying, owner of the Daya Broadcasting Station, who was shot and killed by a murderer at the entrance of Huamanfang Alley on Jiujiang Road at around 8:00 AM on the 27th of last month, the police arrested a suspect, Xiao Yonglin (22 years old) from Changshu, who was acting as a lookout, 50 yards away from the scene of the incident.

The case will continue to be heard by Judge Jiang in the Third Criminal Court. As the police investigation is not yet completed, they requested an extension. Judge Jiang, after considering the circumstances, ordered that the detention be extended for two weeks for further review.

### This Year's Budget of the Public Works Bureau - Public Works Department

Regarding the Public Works Department's budget for this year, it has been diligently reduced in accordance with bureau orders. The draft budget has also been reviewed by the Public Works Committee in a meeting held on the 1st of last month.

A. Temporary Expenditure Items

Temporary expenditures are still divided into the following two categories as usual: (A) Those already approved by the Board of Directors or deemed necessary; (B) Those that should not be spent this year considering financial and other aspects. The draft for this year's temporary expenditures totals 1,039,300 yuan. After item-by-item review by the Committee, 30,400 yuan was reduced. The major expenditures are listed below:

1.  Embankment Category: 10,000 yuan, already approved.

2.  Water Category: This project includes measures to alleviate flooding in the West Shanghai, Central District, and Northern District (such as adding throttle valves in the Central and Northern Districts, installing special joints in the Nanjing Road sewage ditch, installing a pump at the Yu Qiaqing Road pumping station, adding ventilation to the Bailinan Village pumping station in the West District, and a new outlet for the Suzhou Creek, etc.), connection projects for new private buildings, and the installation of public water ditches in several roads in the West District. A total of 100,000 yuan is approved, but it may be reduced by 9,000 yuan in the future.

3.  Sewer Category: 30,000 yuan is approved, but this amount may be reduced by 10,000 yuan for connection subsidies for private buildings.

4.  Building Category: This project includes expanding the internal automatic telephone system in the bureau's main office, adding public restrooms that should be added within the concession, and installing front doors in the public restrooms. A total of 67,000 yuan is approved.

5.  Public Restroom Base Category: 10,000 yuan is approved. This amount includes the cost of purchasing public restroom bases and surplus land.

6.  Land Acquisition Category: When constructing new roads or extending or expanding roads, land must be acquired and compensated by the bureau. This year, 400,000 yuan is approved for this expense.

7.  Road Construction Fee: This year, 300,000 yuan is approved for road construction expenses.

8.  Machinery and Equipment Category: A total of 101,000 yuan is approved for this expense, including the purchase of one garbage truck, six rubber-wheeled handcarts, nine transport carts, equipment for repairing motors, and one stone crusher, among eight items.

B. Recurring Expenditure Items

The draft budget for recurring expenses totals 6,452,900 yuan, which is 2,233,850 yuan more than last year. A comparison is listed below:

The Director of the Public Works Department claimed that in the past three years, the population of this port has increased sharply, and the traffic load on the roads south of the Suzhou Creek is excessive. At the same time, the amount of household garbage has increased by 70% daily, while the department's expenses have been drastically reduced in the past three years. The total expenditure in 1936 was 4,726,000 yuan. If it were to be spent this year, it would require 8,857,000 yuan, almost double.

The above budget has been revised by the Director of the Public Works Department, and projects that are not absolutely necessary this year have been shelved. As a result, a total of 1,300,000 yuan has been reduced. The revised plan and last year's budget are listed as follows:

In addition to the necessary reserves, the above temporary budgets may be adjusted by the Directors of the Finance and Public Works Departments. They are approved for submission to the Finance Committee for review.

### Hang Xiaomei Convicted of Bigamy - Husband's Request for Cohabitation Granted

Chen Shanhua from Nanjing, 29 years old, residing at 50 Rue du Père Robert, married Tao Fengying (also known as Hang Xiaomei, 23 years old this year) in 1934. However, Chen's income was limited, causing Tao to be restless. She ran away in June 1937, and through Chen Shukun as matchmaker, married Guan Shaoqui (27 years old, from Nanjing), a Chinese constable at No. 685, and rented a house to cohabitate at No. 4 Dunren Lane, Beile Road. Recently, Chen discovered this and commissioned lawyer Lu Zhongqi to report to the French Concession police, accusing her of bigamy. As a result, Judge Li of the 8th Criminal Division of the Special No. 2 Court sentenced Hang Xiaomei to three months of imprisonment. Chen then filed a petition with the Civil Division of the Special No. 1 Court, requesting Hang Xiaomei to cohabitate. Yesterday morning, Judge Ma of the 7th Civil Division concluded the trial and announced that Hang Xiaomei should cohabitate with Chen Shanhua. The litigation costs are to be borne by the defendant.

### Murder Case at North Nicheng Bridge - Zhang Lisen Shot Dead - Rumor Has It That Zhang Was the Director of the Greater Shanghai Radio Station - Two Shots Hit Vital Spots, Resulting in Death

In recent weeks, several shootings have occurred continuously between the two special districts of this city. Unexpectedly, at around 5:30 PM yesterday, another shooting occurred on Yu Qiaqing Road in the Public Concession. The victim was reportedly Zhang Lisen, the director of the Greater Shanghai Radio Station. Details are as follows:

Radio Station Director

Zhang Lisen, a native of Anhui, 52 years old, resided at No. 235 Maigen Road, Public Concession. According to general rumors, Zhang Lisen had a close friendship with Dr. Xi Shitai, who was assassinated last year. After Xi was killed, Zhang continued to serve as the director of the Greater Shanghai Radio Station, a position left vacant. However, whether this is true or not cannot be verified.

Killed After Getting Off the Car

At around 5:20 PM yesterday, Zhang was riding alone on the No. 18 trolleybus from north to south. When the bus arrived at North Nicheng Bridge and stopped, Zhang got off the bus. As he was walking along Avenue Edward VII, an assassin suddenly stepped forward and fired several shots at Zhang. At that time, Zhang was hit by two bullets, one in the lung and one in the liver. Blood flowed profusely, and he fell to the ground injured.

Died from Serious Injuries

Seeing that the purpose had been achieved, the assassin mingled into the dense crowd of pedestrians and escaped without a trace. When the nearby Chinese constables arrived, they saw that the assassin had already fled. They immediately called an ambulance and sent the injured Zhang Lisen to Baolong Hospital for treatment. Due to the severity of the injuries in vital spots, the treatment was ineffective, and he died at 6:20 PM. The body was transferred to the coroner's office for examination. The police are currently investigating the details.

### Kidnapping for Ransom Case - New Developments - Rumor Has It That the Wife Appeared in Court to Narrate the Incident - Sudden Repentance After Reconciliation

Chen LiuBao, the son of Chen Dayu, the owner of the Tangshan Bathhouse on Rue des Soeurs in the French Concession, was kidnapped last winter by Chen's apprentice, Wang Amao, in collusion with Chen's tenants, Zhang Fuqing and Zhang Gao's wife, for a large sum of ransom.

Recovered the Hostage

and arrested suspects Fu Xiangtang and Dai Shizhang, owners of the Tianfa Bathhouse on Ma Road, and sent them to the 1st Criminal Division of the Special No. 2 Court, where they were publicly prosecuted for the crime of kidnapping for ransom. After several trials by Judge Miao, the case was adjourned for questioning due to its complexity. The trial continued yesterday morning. Fu's wife, Cai, was summoned to court for questioning. According to her, her husband and the plaintiff were in the same industry

Old Friends for Many Years

Therefore, he was extremely concerned about the kidnapping of his son. Unexpectedly, good intentions turned into bad deeds, and he fell into the clutches of the law. After the last trial, because Chen's son had been released from kidnapping, she requested Chen to withdraw the complaint and not pursue the matter. At that time, Chen agreed, and the defense lawyers hired by Fu and Dai, Ge Zhiqin, Xu Wufang, and Shi Jiutang, signed as witnesses and made a settlement. She also issued another 300 yuan as compensation for Chen's losses this time. Unexpectedly, Chen

Went Back on His Word

Actually denied it in court, which is really for other purposes. Moreover, Chen Shuangxi, who was repeatedly summoned to court as a witness, was Chen's own person, fearing that his testimony would be unfavorable to Chen, Chen even bit him to avoid appearing in court. If the court wants to understand the beginning and end of this case, it can summon Chen Shuangxi to court for questioning and it will be known. The court then questioned Chen Dayu,

Whether He Received

Fu's wife's paper for 300 yuan, Chen denied it. The court then ruled that the case be adjourned for another trial. Chen Shuangxi was ordered to be summoned by the defendant's defense lawyer, Shi Jiutang. The two defendants were returned to custody.

### Gambling Dens Not Allowed in the Nanshi Refugee Area - All Gambling Dens Have Been Closed, but Are Now Reopening One After Another

According to news from the Social News Agency, the gambling dens that had been opened in Nanshi have all been closed uniformly. All the posters that had been posted have been torn down. After only two days, the gambling dens reopened one after another from the day before yesterday, continuing to gather people for gambling. It is reported that these gambling dens currently do not have "licenses." They are all opened by behind-the-scenes people, who charge a reward for one day of operation. On average, each gambling den pays 100 yuan per day. However, there are few gamblers and the operation is extremely poor. It is also learned that the responsible party in the Nanshi refugee area is concerned that these gambling dens set up in the area will affect the well-being of the refugees. Therefore, Father Rao decided to request the French side to negotiate the ban. It is heard that at a minimum, the gambling dens set up in the area must be driven out of the area.

### Paramount Dancing Star - Chen Manli - A Secret Affair

Chen Manli, a popular dancing star at the Paramount, died of injuries after being attacked by thugs on the 24th of last month. Chen was usually very enthusiastic about charitable causes, so social figures all felt regret. As for the reasons for her attack, there are many rumors, and the truth has not yet come to light. The reporter has learned from Chen's friends that she had a secret affair during her lifetime. In October of last year, Chen attended a banquet hosted by a close female friend. While she was in high spirits, her face suddenly turned pale, and she was covered in cold sweat. Her close friends were in a state of panic and helplessness, thinking it was an acute illness. Fortunately, Chen herself was still conscious and tried her best to comfort the guests, saying that she had a new kind of acute stomach disease because her dancing life made her meals and living irregular. However, due to business reasons, it was inconvenient to tell people, so the outside world was absolutely unaware. She pleaded with everyone to keep it a secret. At this time, one of her close friends happened to have Shian Stomach Medicine with her, so she took out three pills and persuaded Chen to swallow them. Sure enough, she recovered immediately and laughed and talked as usual. It never happened again. Because her close friends respected Chen's wishes, they did not talk about this matter for several months. Now that Chen has passed away, this secret affair has finally been revealed.

### Suggestive Couplet

Magistrate Zong Xiangwen of Ningbo Prefecture, upon taking office, reportedly wrote a couplet and hung it on the front door, saying: "This is the public office, where three feet of law are sufficient to stop corruption. I have no private visits, my heart is pledged to a single piece of ice." Is this the sincerity of the magistrate revealed in his words?

### Ode to the Self-Ringing Clock

Day and night it cycles, its path unwavering, time's messages subtly shifting. The watchman fish might leap by chance, the time-leaking dragon not remarkable. It boasts cleverness, measuring the sun, onlookers laugh at its frenzied pace. Pity its winding paths, eventually, it too stops ticking, silent. Following trends, its uneven chime, what matters is the clearness within. No tidal echoes resonate, no borrowed trust dictates its fairness.

### Education in Obedience

— Huang Jiayin

In our flustered, noisy nation, unaccustomed to order, death by crushing is nothing too rare.

At crowded scenes, in places packed with people, it seems insufficient to embellish the bustling scene without pushing over a woman or child, or trampling on a few children.

China has thousands of years of history, which we are proud of, but we have spent these thousands of years pushing and shoving like this, which is a rather unglamorous fact.

The tragedy of the overturned Jing Sheng barge in Ningbo is merely a reenactment of the chaotic social phenomenon of China for thousands of years. This kind of tragedy is a bit unremarkable in our eyes, but what is most heartbreaking is that the occurrence of this kind of tragedy is unnecessary, preventable, and avoidable, but we finally let it happen again.

This fully demonstrates the weaknesses of our people's lack of calmness, lack of order, selfishness, and disregard for public interest.

In this regard, we need a large-scale, universal, and in-depth education in obedience, so that our people can have the habit of obedience, can be calm in the face of emergencies, can take into account the interests of the public, and even sacrifice themselves.

Only in this way can we avoid the recurrence of such unnecessary tragedies and improve our nation's standing in the international community.

### A Sketch of the British Intelligence Department

— Donglin

With the start of this war, Britain immediately established a new "department," which is the "Intelligence Department" dedicated to publishing intelligence and external propaganda.

It may be hard for you to believe, but there are more than nine hundred employees working in this intelligence department. These employees are male and female in gender, and they are civil and military officials in official titles. Presiding over everything above these people is Sir Macmillan, the Minister of Intelligence.

The busiest place in the Intelligence Department building is the press room. Here, hundreds of reporters and correspondents work busily every day. In terms of nationality, they include British, American, French, Japanese, Australian, Swedish, Dutch, Slavic, and so on. There are several women among these reporters, most of whom are very beautiful. Some reporters of color are not allowed to send out communications in their native languages, because these languages cannot be understood by the censors, so they have to write communications in English. There are many interesting people among them, for example, there is a famous American correspondent who makes heavy noises every day at around four o'clock, entering in a grand manner, with two young interviewers and a stenographer, carrying three portable typewriters, all the newspapers of the day, and a large bundle of dictionaries, encyclopedias, maps, and—a bottle of milk.

Each reporter has a table with a typewriter on it, usually surrounded by piles of useless waste paper. On one side of the room is a long row of telephone booths, so that reporters can use the telephone to notify newspapers in case of urgent news. When an important message arrives, the bell rings. Then everyone stops talking, and the sound of the typewriters also diminishes. Everyone listens silently to the news reported in the loudspeaker. At this time, no one is allowed to move, and when another bell notifies that the report is complete, everyone rushes to the telephone booths.

The Minister of Intelligence, Sir Macmillan, holds a conversation with reporters once a day. The venue is in a specific room, which has a podium and many chairs, and a notice prohibiting reporters from smoking is hung on the wall. Therefore, everyone does not smoke, and the first leader is Macmillan himself. The surrounding atmosphere is strangely intimate.

After the meeting, the reporters return to the press room and sometimes continue to work until dawn. What stops them from working from time to time is the censor reading their manuscripts. In theory, British newspapers do not have a censorship system, so British reporters voluntarily send their manuscripts for censorship, entirely to avoid the responsibilities stipulated in the so-called "Official Secrets Act." But foreign reporters are different. Every communication and every phone call is checked by a censor. For every language in Europe, there is a censor in charge; they review telegrams sent to Paris, Rome, Oslo, Helsinki... and listen to correspondents' phone reports to the newspaper. If they hear inappropriate sentences, they have the right to cut them off. The director of the censors is Admiral Cecil Vivian Osborne, a friendly and polite person who was in charge of naval intelligence affairs in 1922. Censors and all news reporters maintain extremely friendly relations. However, correspondents complain about the time it takes for censors to review. For example, when the British Athenia sank, the London correspondent of the New York Times sent out a telegram at 4:19 am after receiving the news, but it arrived in New York after being reviewed at 11:19 pm. By this time, the radio station had already reported the news, so this news completely lost its timeliness.

The Minister of Intelligence is often the object of satire. Here is a representative example.

An editor of a major newspaper received a phone call and only heard the other party say:

"I am the Minister of Intelligence. Can you provide me with information about...?"

Nature

### City and Polluted Air

— Di Kai

The smog and dust that we hate the most in urban areas actually account for a very small proportion of the air. The real polluted things are the particles that wander in the main gas, so small that they are not easily detected by a microscope, and the number is as high as hundreds of millions. Their sources are diverse, some from meteor-like dust, some from ultraviolet light and solar radiation, some from salt crystals evaporated from seawater, and others from the flying of soil, the smoke and ash after forest fires, and the radiation of rocks can produce these harmful small things. The number is roughly 150,000 per cubic inch in the countryside, and 2.5 million in the city. In industrial areas, due to the highly chemically active substances, the number of particles increases greatly, but what is more dangerous is that these substances contain acid compounds.

What impact do these particles have on us humans? Our respiratory organs will be subjected to constant and severe stimulation due to the particles. For example, in the city; 500 million particles pass through our trachea every minute, and 90 million stay in the nostrils, throat, and lobes of the lungs. The places damaged by the particles are taken advantage of by microorganisms. It is not an exaggeration to say that the many respiratory diseases in cities are caused by these particles.

However, there are several natural phenomena that can wash away polluted air: the first is rainwater, the second is strong wind, and the third is sunlight radiation, all of which promote air activity, so that clean air convects over to regulate. However, for cities, the latter two phenomena do not often occur, because dense houses prevent the flow of wind, and the towering buildings also prevent sunlight from reaching the streets. Relatively, particles and ultraviolet rays in sunlight radiation have more influence. When there are few particles, ultraviolet rays that are beneficial to humans can still pass through. Once the density layer of particles becomes thick, the ultraviolet light we receive is greatly reduced. However, according to the experiments of Harvard University in the United States, ultraviolet radiation can kill influenza bacteria, so it is self-evident how particles will harm human health.

Generally, the comparison of the degree of turbidity of air in the countryside and the city is about three to one, that is, a person living in the city gets only one-third of the ultraviolet rays that he gets in the countryside. And in the same city, the air near the sea is cleaner than in the inland, because the ocean air regulates and the movement of the sea breeze greatly reduces the number of particles.

### Elements of Success

— Xu Mengbiao

Shortcomings are inevitable for everyone. As long as one can realize one's own shortcomings and make earnest efforts to correct them, there will be a bright future and a happy path ahead. In particular, the soundness of one's spirit is even more critical to our entire life, governing our success or failure. Therefore, we should examine the past to see what spiritual deficiencies we have, and then resolve to eliminate them thoroughly. This is the way to walk the road to success. Below are the weaknesses in spirit that everyone should try to correct:

(1) Forgetfulness (2) Indecisiveness (3) Vacillation (4) Timidity (5) Pessimism (6) Carelessness and absentmindedness (7) Perpetual frowning (8) Weak will (9) Lack of self-confidence (10) Lewd thoughts (11) Lack of reflection (12) Lack of focus

Now let us examine ourselves to see if we suffer from the above weaknesses. Below are the necessary conditions for a sound spirit. Do we possess all of them? (1) Strong will (2) Self-confidence (3) Courage and decisiveness (4) Focus (5) Creative genius (6) Deep observation (7) Fair judgment (8) Prudence (9) Organizational skills (10) Leadership skills (11) Comprehension (12) Intelligence (13) Cheerfulness (14) Optimism

Miscellaneous Thoughts

### Looking at it Differently

— Xiaojiao

Customers waiting to board a streetcar often scramble to squeeze on when the car arrives, no matter how crowded it is inside. I have seen many customers who, even when there is no space left for even a foot, still try to squeeze on. But after they squeeze on, they look at the customers getting on at each new stop with a different attitude. I have often heard these same people who scrambled on saying, "Why are they opening the doors when it's already so packed!"

### Responsible for Faith (Part 1)

It is very instructive to compare Dante's list of those destined for hell with the list that the Lord Jesus gave in the parable of those who would gnash their teeth in the dark hell. Dante's list includes: lustful, gluttonous, fierce, heretical, murderous, tyrannical, miserly, lying, and traitorous people. Jesus' list includes: five foolish virgins who were thoughtless and unprepared, thinking that everything was fine and not needing to worry, and were lazy and waited for others; the servant who received one talent from his master and did not put it to use, but thought he was doing well; guests invited to a wedding who did not wear wedding clothes because of carelessness or arrogance; rich people who were comfortable and happy but, though they did not commit any crimes, were qualified for hell; and guests who excused themselves from attending the banquet because they were busy and believed their reasons were justified. Looking at this list, we feel that none of them are major sinners, and none of them would have a place in Dante's hell. Their fall was because their view of life was wrong. They thought there was no need to always be prepared, and that it did not matter whether they opposed God or worked for God. They also thought that there was no need to respect others, that they could enjoy the pleasures of life and do less of their duty; or they were too busy all day long and forgot about spiritual things. In short, they were condemned because they did not have a correct faith. Sometimes we seem to feel that a person is not necessarily condemned because of an error in belief, but the examples we have listed are enough to warn us of the danger in this. Someone may ask, is it fair that I should be condemned for having a wrong belief because I do not understand the truth? The answer depends on the circumstances. For example, a small child who, because of his age, has no opportunity to know what he should know, runs onto the streetcar tracks, no one will blame him. But if it were a young man, everyone would call him a stupid pig. If a ship owner said that he did not know that a certain place on the navigation chart was marked with a reef, would that be a valid reason for his accident? He has a responsibility to know before setting sail. Also, if a commander leads an army to battle and the entire army is wiped out, would it be a valid reason to say that he did not know that the enemy had set up an ambush? He has a responsibility to scout out the enemy's ambush in advance. Furthermore, if a mother feeds her child hard food when the child has enteritis, saying that she did not know it would be harmful to the child, would we forgive her? She should have the common knowledge of how to care for a sick child. There are countless examples like these. (To be continued) For detailed research, please send a letter with postage to P.O.

### A Casual Discussion on Family Films

— Xinying

There are usually two types of family films: one is based on the actors, with the actors in a family as the main body on the screen, and the rest of the supporting roles are unimportant, such as the Qiong Family Troupe, the Ha Family Troupe...etc. Recently, this type of family film has also been very popular, and the audience particularly welcomes them; the other is based on the story, and the content of the story describes various events in the family. As far as the Shanghai movie audience is concerned, this type of family film is also very welcome. What I want to propose is this type of family film.

Indeed, movies have a great suggestive power. Everything shown on the screen suggests something to the audience, making them feel good, and even imitating it unconsciously. Therefore, the description of the story in a family film is sometimes enough to influence the audience's family. Movies can cause rifts in a happy family; similarly, they can eliminate disagreements and turn a family with rifts into a happy one.

The reason why the general movie audience likes to watch family films is undoubtedly to pay attention to all issues related to the family. How can husband and wife, father and son, reconcile and prevent rifts? These are all worth studying. This tendency is not only in China, but also in every city in the world, there will be a part of the movie audience who likes to watch family movies. Especially those who have families and are masters and mistresses are most interested. Therefore, although family films do not occupy an important position in the entire film production industry, every Hollywood film company will produce a part of family films every year so as not to disappoint this group of audiences.

### Garbo Changes Style, Starring in the Comedy Ninotchka

— Yuqie

For thirteen years, the great Garbo has roamed the screen, always the supreme symbol of mystery and sadness. She flickered like the winter ice, and was as unpredictable as fleeting dark clouds. In almost every film she starred in, she had a tragic ending. For example, in the early A Woman of Affairs, she died in a car crash; in Anna Christie (the Chinese title seems to be Resurrection, Garbo's first talkie, filmed in 1930), her soul was tormented; in Mata Hari, she was arrested and executed in January; in Camille, she died of tuberculosis; in Anna Karenina (Tolstoy's masterpiece), she committed suicide under a train.

Now, a new Garbo has suddenly appeared. This new Garbo is lively, happy, unrestrained, humorous, and full of youthful enthusiasm. In the new film, she is a Bolshevik envoy sent to Paris to monitor and investigate three wavering comrades. There, she herself falls in love. Garbo delicately portrays the transformation of the heroine from a serious and stubborn party fanatic to a lovely woman. Her lightheartedness, her shy and humorous demeanor, make MGM's Ninotchka a new peak in the art of film satire.

The extraordinary joy and happiness with which she performs the heroine's private life in this new film has been unanimously praised by all walks of life in Hollywood. It is said that Ninotchka is the greatest romantic satirical comedy of the year. Garbo is the heroine Ninotchka; her lover (and later husband) is a Parisian "Duke" Leon - to be precise, the mustachioed Melvyn Douglas.

### About the "New Arts Drama Society"

— Hua

The motivation for organizing the "New Arts Drama Society" was as early as when Wu Yonggang directed "Regret at the End of the Ming Dynasty" for the Shanghai Drama Society. Because many filmmakers were making cameo appearances in this play at that time, they discussed that if they had the opportunity, they would like to organize a troupe, but because of time and space, they could only perform on the road. Yuan Muzhi once said: "Film is the husband's home, and drama is the mother's home." Now that they have the opportunity to return to their mother's home, they are naturally very excited to prepare for the organization; Wu Yonggang, Liu Qiong, Yi Gang, Wang Xichun, etc. were appointed as persons in charge at the time.

However, the "husband's home" was also very busy, and apart from deciding on "New Arts" as the name of the society, everything else almost came to a standstill. It was not until recently, when Wu Yonggang's "Serving the Country with Utmost Loyalty" was completed, that the old matter was brought up again. The above is what I know about the organization of "New Arts."

Now everyone is eagerly hoping to perform as soon as possible, and the issue of actors is also being negotiated in all directions; however, the play to be performed is not "Empress Dowager Cixi" as reported in the newspapers yesterday, but "Heroes of the Sea." I think the earliest performance period will be two months later.

At the same time, they are also preparing a Peking opera troupe, which will probably have to wait until Yu Xichun returns (Wang Xichun has now gone to Hong Kong.)

The Unparalleled Changban Slope and Hanjin Ford (Part 1)

In the eighth year of the Republic of China, the Tianchan Stage (Erma Road) invited San Xiao Yi Bai to come south. The cast was very complete. The so-called San Xiao Yi Bai refers to Yang Xiaolou, Tan Xiaopei, Shang Xiaoyun, and Bai Mudan, who later changed his name to Gou Huisheng. At that time, the Sheng and Li families in Shanghai, because they were both descendants of dukes and ministers, and they were economically affluent, they would of course pay special attention to this Master Yang who had served in the inner court and received special rewards from the Empress Dowager. Therefore, after Xiao Lou first arrived in Shanghai and paid a visit to the two mansions, they both scrambled to book the entire flower building for a month, in order to show that they had done their duty as hosts. The good plays performed after taking the stage are difficult to list all at once, but there is one play that I can never forget, which is "Changban Slope with the Throwing of the Infant" and continuing to perform "Hanjin Ford".

Xiao Lou's long-robe play is naturally the only famous play of the Yu school that everyone knows. Moreover, he was in his prime at that time, and he was not lazy at all. All the singing, acting, reciting, and fighting were wonderful and unique, which can be said to be a feast for the eyes. In addition to his own superb skills, which made the audience fascinated, the supporting roles in the play at that time can also be said to be unparalleled in the north and south. First, let's talk about Luo Xiaobao's Liu Bei: he was originally a famous Tan school old man, and his voice of "clouds covering the moon" was sweet, mellow and vigorous. Not only was it ten times higher than Tan Wu (Xiao Pei), who was also under the same Hao, but even the general Tan school old men now cannot compare with him. It was an overqualified role for her to play Xuan De, but his singing of "Sighing for the Fifth Watch" and his performance in the "Throwing the Infant" scene really earned him a lot of applause; partly because it was Xiao Lou who was playing with him, and partly because he put in extra effort, he also vented his dissatisfaction. Then, it is even more rare to be paired with the Second Madam Mi; it turns out to be Shang Xiaoyun, Bai Mudan, two of today's four famous Dans. At that time, Huisheng's worth was far inferior to Xiaoyun. I said before that Xun Shang was singing "Hongni Pass" and scolding on stage, which was at this time.
