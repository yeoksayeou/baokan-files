### Declaration of the Board of Directors of This Company

Mr. Huang Chu Jiu, the founder of this company, was a pioneer in China's new pharmaceutical industry. Decades ago, Mr. Huang, recognizing the urgent need of Chinese people for Western medicines and the huge outflow of capital, established this company with the aim of recovering rights and interests. The greatness of its scale and the thoroughness of its planning have long become an indelible historical fact in the new pharmaceutical industry. Unfortunately, Mr. Huang passed away before completing his grand undertaking. Unwilling to sit idly by and watch this hard-earned great cause be ruined in one fell swoop, we, his colleagues, raised funds to take over the company and reorganized it. We thought that with everyone's agreement, the established rules could be continued. However, difficulties arose at every step, and disagreements emerged. Like people in the same boat during a storm, we were ashamed, and eventually parted ways. Fortunately, after enduring hardships, we became more determined and strived to overcome difficulties. We are also grateful for the kind care and encouragement from all sectors, which allowed this company to develop step by step and flourish. In 1934, we added a medical and pharmaceutical department, and in 1937, we established a nutritional food department, achieving our current status and glory. The reputation and achievements of all this company's exports are well known to all sectors, so there is no need to elaborate further. However, this company has always held two major principles in the production of pharmaceuticals. First, the aim is to recover the outflow of capital, not to compete fiercely with peers for profit. Therefore, the products of this company are all aimed at meeting the urgent needs of the Chinese people, with the goal of creating products not already available domestically. The most notable examples are "Bulito" and "Lakoufu" malted milk, which were pioneering creations in the domestic Western medicine industry when they were first launched. This is evident to all. Our intention is not to show off or be pretentious, but to adhere to the principle of recovering rights and interests and to avoid unnecessary competition with peers, which would be ridiculed by foreigners. Second, the raw materials used in this company's pharmaceutical products are of the highest quality, and the efficacy is guaranteed to be accurate. Experts are hired to conduct specialized testing, and we never attempt to reduce costs by deceiving ourselves and others. The ingredients must undergo strict inspection to avoid misleading others and ourselves. The above two points are the principles that this company will always uphold. This company deeply understands that the mission of the new pharmaceutical industry is significant and cannot be compared to ordinary businesses. The launch of each product has a profound impact on social health. Any negligence will make us sinners against society and humanity. The colleagues of this company always maintain a sense of caution, and we are extremely careful in the production of our products, adhering to the principle of "better to have nothing than to have substandard goods," and we dare not be greedy for more or seek novelty. This is what the colleagues of this company can be proud of, and it is also well known to society. Now, on the occasion of the third anniversary of the launch of Lakoufu malted milk and the completion of the new giant machinery installation, we humbly announce this and hope that

Our compatriots and talents will provide guidance from time to time, which would be a great honor for this company and a great prospect for the new pharmaceutical industry.

### Lakoufu in the Words of Doctors

— Du He

If a person cannot even believe in himself, who else can he hope to believe in him? No one will believe in him. Then, what else can this person do? This applies to individuals, and by extension, it also applies to a country and a nation.

However, Chinese people have always been reluctant to trust Chinese goods. In the past, almost everything was better if it was imported. It was only through the efforts of people in the national goods industry, using facts to correct this distorted mentality, that things slowly began to change. The reputation of national goods has been rising day by day. Everyone understands that the quality of national goods is no worse than that of imported goods. However, to be honest, it seems that a strong sense of confidence has not yet been established in the medical and pharmaceutical sector. When people get sick and need medicine or injections, it is naturally something that cannot be easily experimented with. Doctors are unwilling to experiment, and patients dare not experiment—success has always been achieved through experimentation. Without experimentation, it is difficult to make progress. Therefore, in this sector, the final victory still requires the efforts of all parties.

One day, at a gathering at a doctor's house, I suddenly heard someone ask the doctor, "It's getting cold, what should we eat?" The doctor blurted out, "Something like Lakoufu is very good." The person then asked, "Is it about the same as foreign goods?" The doctor replied, "They are made of the same raw materials, so the effectiveness is naturally about the same. Why spend more money?" I know that the doctor has no connection with Jiufu. So, his recommendation of Lakoufu is certainly reliable. Therefore, I have gained trust in Lakoufu, or at least, my doubts have been dispelled.

I think that everyone values their own life, and that is undoubtedly true. Therefore, needles and medicines used for treatment should not be casually recommended. However, tonics are clearly different from needles and medicines, so why be overly superstitious about imported goods? Moreover, with a doctor recommending it, it is evident that this product is more reliable, so why not give it a try? Success has always been achieved through experimentation!

Forgive me for not being able to say how good Lakoufu is. Because excessive exaggeration is not only useless but also harmful to the facts. All I dare to say is what the doctor said: "Something like Lakoufu is very good."

### Ode to Jiufu

— Yu Kongwo

Jiufu Company, a pioneer in the pharmaceutical industry, initially laid the foundation, thanks to Mr. Huang Chu Jiu.

Domestically produced Western medicine, a wake-up call for society, foresight, and followed by peers.

The giant star suddenly fell, the grand undertaking unfinished, relying on many talents, seeking common ground.

Collective wisdom and effort, loyalty to the cause, product quality improving daily, reputation growing daily.

Like Bulito, like England, word-of-mouth praises, praise abounds.

Progressing daily, difficult to confine, created Lakoufu, the champion of tonics.

Strengthening the body and brain, improving intelligence and enlightenment, better taste than delicacies, more effective than ginseng.

Superior to imported goods, ingenious workmanship, spreads like wildfire, agile as a swimming dragon.

For three years now, universally admired, wholesale and retail, snatched up empty.

Increased purchase of giant machinery, further expansion, recovering capital outflow, consistently pursuing initial aspirations.

Reviving our decline, benefiting even the humble, joyful and praying, boundless blessings.

### Impromptu Verse While Drinking Lakoufu

— Li Haoran

A cup of rich fragrance, drunk and full. The aftertaste quenches thirst and brings clarity.

From now on, I no longer envy Western dew. The finest nectar in China is the most delicious.

### Praise to Lakoufu

— Zhou Shoujuan

Jiufu Company makes Lakoufu malted milk from cocoa, wheat extract, milk, and cheese. Its color, aroma, and taste are all excellent. People with minor ailments drink it daily and find it delicious, praising it as unparalleled.

Cocoa, wheat extract, and cheese. The flavor is naturally delightful.

Fine nectar and jade liquid, the pleasure of immortals. Lakoufu is now enjoyed by people in the world.

When there's a minor illness, the pharmacy flies a dragon banner. In the boudoir, the curtains are drawn all day.

Pity her thin bones after eating fragrant peaches. Gladly, she gets a cup of fairy brew.

### Infinite Good Fortune

— Jiang Zongyi

On this dark and isolated island, people are extremely lonely. Occasionally, drinking a few cups of strong coffee can be exciting, but the stimulation is always followed by a sleepless night. Thoughts surge like a thousand waves, unstoppable. So, while strong coffee is delicious, its excessive stimulation of the nerves is a drawback.

However, since learning that Jiufu Company produces Lakoufu malted milk, I have replaced coffee with it. Because it has the rich flavor of coffee, as well as the power of nourishment and invigoration, without the excessive stimulation of coffee. Not only does it not have a strong stimulating effect on the nerves, but it also has a sleep-inducing effect. Therefore, after extreme mental exertion, drinking a cup of Lakoufu immediately invigorates me, and I can also get enough sleep at night. So, in fact, I have greatly improved my health. If we interpret "Le" as "good," then Lakoufu is good fortune. And my being able to drink Lakoufu regularly is precisely my good fortune. Now, in addition to Lakoufu malted milk, Jiufu Company has also launched Lakoufu nutritional biscuits. I heard that they are also planning to launch Lakoufu nutritional candies in the future, which can truly be said to be infinite good fortune and infinite happiness.

### My Impression of Lakoufu

— Qi Hua

Recently, many people have lamented the influx of foreign goods and the decline of national goods, as if consumers were born with a slavish mentality of admiring foreign things. However, the development of this mentality is the joint responsibility of manufacturers and consumers. Consumers are greedy for cheapness, and manufacturers produce shoddy goods, resulting in products that appear good on the surface but are actually scams.

I often think that this mistake must be corrected. Manufacturers must produce goods conscientiously, and consumers must also open their eyes. For example, when imitating foreign goods, at least imitate them so that they are consistent inside and out, and the price should be reduced as much as possible, but not so low that it requires cutting corners. I often talk about this idea with my friends, because I am often sick and take medicine almost every other day, and "imported" tonics are too expensive to afford. I desperately hope that there are national goods that can be bought as replacements.

This Mid-Autumn Festival, a friend sent me several cans of Lakoufu malted milk and Lakoufu biscuits. The friend said, "Don't underestimate them. The color, aroma, and taste are all the same as genuine 'imported' goods. You often suffer from insomnia, so drink a cup before bed, or have it as a snack in the morning, and that would be great."

I didn't pay much attention to it when I heard it. At night, I still listlessly lay on the chair as usual, but my wife brewed a cup of Lakoufu. Smiling, she handed it to me. The hot aroma rushed straight into my nose, and I suddenly felt refreshed. She went and got two biscuits. I drank and ate, and found them to be fragrant, sweet, and crunchy. I really enjoyed it. So, that night I had a comfortable and sound sleep, but I still thought it was somewhat of a psychological effect. Later, it was like this for several days in a row, and I was energetic and optimistic in everything. I am convinced that Lakoufu really has a calming and brain-boosting effect, and it is especially suitable for neurasthenia. To be honest, I used to be superstitious about foreign tonics. I thought that if I couldn't afford foreign goods, then I would rather not buy them, because most Chinese products are unreliable. Now that "Lakoufu" has been launched, my biased views have naturally been eliminated. I thank Jiufu Company. They not only sell the same quality as foreign goods at a lower price, but also, due to such genuine value for money, they have also corrected the general public's mentality of being superstitious about foreign goods.

Now, due to the fact that Lakoufu is in greater demand than supply, Jiufu Company has purchased the latest Swiss machinery and is preparing for mass production, striving for perfection. I heard a few days ago that they are going to publish a commemorative special issue to promote "Lakoufu," so I am very happy to write this short article, because I, who have always suffered from neurasthenia, have become energetic since taking Lakoufu. The birth and popularity of "Lakoufu," its significance is far beyond what ordinary people call "business development." It has made the greatest and best contribution to the health of the people!

### Color, Aroma, and Taste are All Excellent

— Feng Mengyun

Last month, Jiufu Company hosted a banquet and gave me two cans of Lakoufu malted milk and two cans of nutritional biscuits. I took them home for my wife and children. The biscuits were eaten up by my children in a day or two. I drink the malted milk before going to bed, and I always feel that its fragrance is clear and refreshing, unlike any other drink. Moreover, there is absolutely no sediment, which is why it is so valuable.

Jiufu Company has the longest history among the new pharmaceutical companies. The founder was Mr. Huang Chu Jiu. At that time, Mr. Huang invented a type of Bai Ling Ji, which was famous at the time for its "unexpected efficacy." Later, Bulito was launched, and its reputation became even higher. It was even regarded as the top tonic in the market, and to this day, no other tonic has been able to compete with Bulito. The name of Jiufu Company also became famous because of the strong sales of Bulito. Since then, every product launched by Jiufu Company has become popular, all thanks to the successful sales of Bulito.

Lakoufu malted milk is the most powerful of the new products launched by Jiufu Company in recent years. Now, a new neon light stands tall on Yu Qiaqing Road, attracting the attention of passersby. Its sales are increasing day by day, which can be predicted. The writer has been drinking it for more than a month and is willing to use the six words "Color, aroma, and taste are all excellent" to make a definitive assessment.

### I Love Lakoufu

— Zhou Tianlai

I am a person who makes a living by writing. I rack my brains every day of the year, writing while using cigarettes to help my thoughts. I know it's useless, but I have no substitute. I don't like candy or snacks. Every night, I often feel dry tongue and lips, and mentally exhausted. Recently, a friend advised me to drink Lakoufu malted milk produced by Jiufu Company. I drink a cup every night after finishing my writing debts, and it is indeed delicious, quenches thirst, and refreshes the mind, losing the previous fatigue. I also add a few Lakoufu nutritional biscuits, which are filling, thirst-quenching, and comforting to the body and mind. I am grateful for my friend's sincere recommendation, and I also admire the excellent products of Jiufu Company, which are comparable to imported products of the same nature. I heard that the company has recently imported the latest machinery to manufacture it, further striving for perfection. It is truly the light of national goods, and it is precisely my "good fortune" without end. Now, even my children love to drink Lakoufu malted milk, especially my six-month-old daughter, who eats five Lakoufu biscuits a day. This is a fact.

### From Lakoufu Biscuits to a Father-Son Debate

— Xue Xi

One day, I and several gentlemen, including Kongwo and Yifang Mengyun, were eating together. Because I was arguing with someone in the newspaper about the issue of father and son, our conversation unintentionally turned to this issue as well. My view is that all parents love their children, so children should also be filial to their parents. My argument is based on seeing how my wife takes care of our children, using all her heart and suffering all the hardships, which makes me think of my parents in the past, who also tried their best and placed so much hope on their children. So my position is that children, seeing how they love their own children, cannot forget to love their parents as much as they love their own children. At that time, I had just bought two cans of Lakoufu biscuits, preparing to take them back for Yiyang to eat, so I pointed to the biscuits to prove the parents' love for their children. Mengyun, however, thought that what I said was wrong. He said that children are fundamentally unreliable, so parents don't need to have any hope for their children. But I always feel that although parents don't expect their children to repay them, children cannot help but do their best to repay even a fraction of the profound kindness of their parents. Kongwo looked at my biscuits and smiled: "I once said that it's better to sell children's toys than to open a shop selling tonics for the elderly." This remark is very subtle and meaningful, which means that after all, there are more people in the world who love their children than those who respect their parents. I was also thinking in my heart that if my parents were still alive, I might not be able to buy some tonics for them to take, but now I hear that Jiufu Company's Lakoufu nutritional biscuits are made of the finest biscuit ingredients with the addition of the right amount of Lakoufu malted milk, and are refined according to scientific methods. They contain protein, fat, and various vitamins A, B, C, and D. They are really the most suitable and nourishing food for children, and they are also delicious and filling. I hurriedly bought two cans to take back, which is enough to show the parents' concern and love for their children. Because of this, how can children neglect and disappoint the painstaking efforts of their parents? Yifang has always been very careless about everything, but when he heard that Lakoufu nutritional biscuits are a boon for children, he asked about the price and said that he also wanted to buy two cans. I nodded and smiled, which is also proof of parents' love for their children. I record this incident as a digression from the father-son debate. I hope that people who have children will read this article and know that Lakoufu nutritional biscuits are a boon for children, but at the same time, I hope that people who have parents will also be able to finish reading this article so that they know the parents' love for their children.

### A Blessing in Sickness

— Ying Ning Gongzi

Lakoufu malted milk is one of the products of Jiufu Company. Many of my friends take Lakoufu. I usually don't like to take tonics very much, so I haven't tried it. However, I know that Lakoufu malted milk has been able to take the place of imported goods in recent years. Therefore, although I don't eat this stuff, I have a good impression of it when people mention Lakoufu, because it can defeat foreign goods, which should recover a lot of capital outflow for the country. Recently, I suffered from illness for a few days, which is the so-called dengue fever. I am a person who lives alone, and no one asks about soup and medicine when I am sick, so I entered the International Sanatorium. The sanatorium provides patients with three meals a day, and there is also a snack in the afternoon, which is Lakoufu malted milk and Lakoufu biscuits. When I was sick, my mouth felt very bitter, and I needed sweet drinks to regulate it. Lakoufu malted milk and biscuits suited my taste. Not only did I recognize it as the only blessing in my sickness, but now that I am well, I still drink Lakoufu malted milk every day, because in the past I only had a good impression of it, but now it has become my favorite. I never expected to form this relationship with Lakoufu because of illness, and the hospital also uses Lakoufu as a snack for patients, which shows that this stuff is really a tonic that is beneficial to life.

### Lakoufu Can Repel Ghosts

— Chushi

Some people may be shocked to see this title. Lakoufu is a nutritional product, not a talisman of Zhang Tianshi, so how can it repel ghosts? Isn't this alarmist talk? I say, this is not a lie at all, it is entirely true, and let me slowly explain.

Last winter, I made a decision to ask a doctor to adjust my body, but in the process of adjusting, I became a physically weak person. When I did things, I was listless, and when I raised my head, golden blowflies flew around like singing orioles. When I ate, I had no taste at all, and everything became dull and boring.

It was probably the third day of the lunar new year this year. I had nothing to do at night, so I went to bed early. The lights were not turned off. When I woke up, a headless woman suddenly stood in front of my bed, standing still. I thought to myself, in the middle of the night, why is there such an uninvited female guest? Could it be that the fox spirit mentioned in the Liaozhai has come? At that time, I was not afraid, but instead opened my eyes wide to see clearly. I saw the woman slowly shortening, shrinking smaller and smaller, and eventually disappearing without a trace.

The next day at the newspaper office, I told the story of seeing a ghost the night before. Everyone said, "Where are there any ghosts? Maybe you are too nervous, so you have to find a doctor to see." I thought that this was reasonable, so I asked a doctor, who also determined that it was neurasthenia. In addition to taking some medicine, he also told me to take Lakoufu often, because Lakoufu has special effects in treating brain marrow deficiency and neurasthenia. I listened to the doctor's words, bought two cans of Lakoufu, and after taking it, my spirit was greatly boosted, and I could sleep at night. From then on, I regarded Lakoufu as my regular food. Now, my body is getting fatter every day, with a big belly, and I have never seen a ghost again at night. With this said, isn't Lakoufu able to repel ghosts? I think, if friends are afraid of being haunted by living ghosts, everyone should eat more cans of Lakoufu to maintain their health and righteousness.

### On Lakoufu Malted Milk

— Dalang

Since the launch of Lakoufu malted milk, its sales have been so strong that, according to surveys, the ratio of it to imported goods is 3,000 to 150. Seeing the strong sales of domestic nutritional products, I know that the producers did not waste their huge investment in plugging the capital outflow, which is gratifying. For the past one or two months, I have been taking this product without interruption. I am physically weak and take tonics all year round, but I do not persist, stopping after ten days or a month. The only reason I have been eating Lakoufu without getting tired of it is because it excels in color, aroma, and taste. I eat a meal of it in the morning, mixing it with a raw egg, and another meal before bed, adding a little milk. The method may not be compliant with the rules, but it is very sweet to eat, so it has become a habit. I once got a sentence when I was idly chanting in the Ming Lou: "I once bothered Su Shou to learn how to make soup, the color and fragrance are combined, and the taste is mellow. A cup is offered to Lang, it should be cherished, and I wish him a long life because of his good fortune." A woman in the boudoir also likes this, so there is this sentence.

### Self-Introduction of Our Company

— Factory Director Hu Zhenhan, Pharmacist

Jiu Fu Pharmaceutical Company was established in the twelfth year of the Republic of China, and eighteen years have passed since then. It was originally founded solely by the late pharmaceutical tycoon Huang Chujiu. At that time, medical science was flourishing day by day, but medicines were mostly imported from abroad. Mr. Huang felt ashamed of this and gathered elites from both the medical and pharmaceutical fields to painstakingly create this factory. Its products were initially known to the world for Bainianji tonic and Bulido. The company's reputation grew day by day. Unfortunately, the original founder passed away suddenly in the nineteenth year of the Republic of China, and the factory's operations almost came to a standstill. The following year, the founders of our company, recognizing the great significance of Jiu Fu to national health and industry, raised funds to take over the company and reorganized it into a limited liability company. With a focus on innovation, business progressed daily. New-style machinery is added every year in order to improve the quality of products. At the same time, we have made every effort to expand the scope of manufacturing in order to meet social needs. In addition to the raw material and pharmaceutical manufacturing department, which is currently being planned and established, we have now established a research department and a manufacturing department. The manufacturing department includes a pharmaceutical department and a nourishing food department. We also pay attention to the investigation and research of raw materials. The existing equipment can be said to be quite complete. The research department is equipped with a chemical laboratory, a biological assay laboratory, a hydrogen ion concentration measurement room, an ultraviolet light room, a photography room, an animal room, and an organ dissection room. The manufacturing department has a pill-making machine, a tablet-making machine, a combination machine, a vacuum immersion machine, an electric grinder, an alkalization machine, a super-powered centrifuge, a constant-temperature electric dryer, a pressure filter, a vacuum distillation machine, a milling machine, a mixing machine, an ice-making machine, a centrifugal separator, a centrifugal crystallization machine, an ampoule sterilizer, a centrifugal serum clarification machine, a vacuum ampoule filling machine, a vacuum dryer, a vacuum evaporator, etc. The nourishing food section includes a malted milk extract and biscuit and candy manufacturing department, and a malted milk essence manufacturing department. Newly imported giant machines from Switzerland have an extremely complex overall structure and must go through more than ten procedures each time to complete the production of loose, easily soluble, and completely tasteless light yellow granules. From manufacturing to packaging, everything is done by machinery, absolutely without human contact, and it is especially clean and hygienic. The biscuit and candy department is equipped with an electric milling machine, a steam mixing machine, a can-making machine, a screening machine, a packaging machine, a constant-temperature electric oven, a kneading machine, a rolling mill, an automatic biscuit making machine, etc. In terms of products, pharmaceuticals are divided into prescription drugs and medical drugs. Proprietary medicines include Bainianji, Jiu Fu Milk White Cod Liver Oil, Sheng Dan, Bainian Oil, Qianliyan Eye Drops, etc. Medical drugs include Gager, Spleen Su, Indumon, Appin, Itasu, Buxieduo, Bulido, Laike Ding, Maeskemeng, Adick Meng, Linaofu, Jiashimeng, etc. The nourishing food department includes Lekoufu Malted Milk Essence, Lekoufu Nourishing Biscuits, Lekoufu Nourishing Toffee, Qiaosheng Guo, etc., which are manufactured according to nutritional principles and have the effect of nourishing and strengthening the body. There are many other items still under research. All products of our company are manufactured with precision and care, and their efficacy is magnificent. We are very grateful for the trust of the medical community and the popularity of patients. As for the manufacture of drugs, it must go through a thorough scientific inspection and manufacturing process and potency determination of finished products. There is proper management, and the personnel responsible for this work have all undergone scientific training in pharmacognosy, chemistry, pharmacology, and biology, and devote their full time to work. Moreover, all raw materials, whether they are crude drugs or organic and inorganic chemical drugs, must undergo scientific inspection when they enter the factory, and their identity and purity are inspected one by one. Only those that meet the standards are adopted. After the drugs are manufactured, they must undergo various inspections, and special attention is paid to quality and efficacy. However, the essence of science lies in the pursuit of perfection, and there is no limit to the development of business. Our colleagues will certainly work harder to live up to the expectations of the community. Unfortunately, incidents have occurred frequently in recent years. When Bulido was first launched, foreign merchants used their power to obstruct it, and competitors took the opportunity to attack it. However, justice is in the hearts of the people, and facts speak louder than words. Bulido still became popular without advertising, and sales are increasing day by day. Today, it and Lekoufu Malted Milk Essence are the two major contributions of our company. It is beneficial to the health of citizens and is an outstanding tonic. Everyone praises it. We hope that medical and pharmaceutical seniors and sages from all walks of life will give us advice from time to time so that all improvements can be followed. We look forward to it.

### Ambassador Guo Meets with the British Chancellor of the Exchequer　Continuing Negotiations on Aid to China　Britain Will Lend China 10 Million Pounds　Sino-American Loan Agreement May Be Signed Next Week

London　Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi continued yesterday to consult with the Minister in Charge Atlee and Chancellor of the Exchequer Wood on the matter of financial aid to China. The Chinese side believes that because the British government lacks someone to preside over it, the progress of this negotiation will inevitably be somewhat frustrated. Yesterday's consultation was only preliminary, and the exact amount of the loan is still unknown. However, it is widely believed that the amount should be around 10 million pounds. The British Treasury previously lent China 5 million pounds in 1938 to stabilize Chinese finance. This decision should continue to provide funds, but still take cautious steps to prevent the Japanese from speculating and profiting from it. The new loan may also have an important feature, namely that Britain may negotiate with China to purchase military supplies and raw materials on credit, and the purchasing location will not be limited to Britain itself. All countries with a pound-based system will be included. Regarding this matter, Britain has exchanged views with its overseas territories and invited them to cooperate in assisting China. (United Press dispatch on the 7th)

Washington　Loan agreements between China and Argentina will be signed next week. President Roosevelt approved the loans from both parties before leaving for the Caribbean. (International News Agency dispatch on the 7th)

Ottawa　Canadian Prime Minister King stated in the House of Commons today that Canada has prohibited nickel exports since the outbreak of the war. Therefore, he must vigorously deny the statement made by McClubber, the representative of the International Red Cross in China, that Canadian nickel was still being shipped to Japan last week. Export permits for this item must first be verified that there is absolutely no danger of direct or indirect transfer to enemy countries before they can be issued. The shipper must also provide a guarantee that the item will not be transferred to other countries after it arrives at its destination. As for scrap nickel, it can be transferred, but the quantity is very small and not important. (Reuters dispatch on the 7th)

Tokyo　Today's editorial in the Hochi Shimbun criticized the United States' decision to lend China 100 million yuan, saying that this kind of loan is a direct challenge to Japan. This move is tantamount to bombing the foundation for establishing a new order in East Asia and causing an unforgettable unpleasant impression among the Japanese people. At this time, Japan should strengthen its relations with the Axis powers on the one hand and adjust its relations with the Soviet Union as soon as possible. (Reuters dispatch on the 7th)

Lyon　The "Times" recently published an editorial with a commentary on the situation in the Far East. The article stated, "Since Britain is at war with Germany, it is difficult to take care of the East, and it must follow the lead of the United States. Although Japan has strongly reacted to the United States' loan of 100 million US dollars to the Chinese Nationalist Government, it still maintains normal diplomatic relations with the United States. At this moment, there is no worrying sign that a major entanglement will occur between the United States and Japan in the short term. As far as the Soviet Union is concerned, Soviet Ambassador to the United States Uyansky recently held talks with US State Department officials, and the talks mainly focused on the situation in the Far East. However, relations between Japan and the Soviet Union have eased and are continuing to progress. Japanese newspapers generally say that various outstanding issues between Japan and the Soviet Union, such as the exchange of raw materials, the supply of coal and kerosene, and fishing rights, can be quickly resolved under conditions that are beneficial to both parties. In short, Japan seems to have decided to make full use of the German-Italian-Japanese alliance, and its attitude in the Far East will be clarified in the short term," etc. (Havas dispatch on the 6th)

### Normal Relations Maintained Between Berlin and Chongqing　Germany Does Not Want to Take Actions That Hinder the Soviet Union　The Soviet Union's Far East Policy is Regarded as Satisfactory by the United States

London　The Times reported a special article, stating that according to the German Foreign Ministry spokesman, Jiang Wei Yuanzhang's declaration after the signing of the Japanese-Wang agreement was not affected in Berlin. Its meaning is that Germany attaches great importance to maintaining the existing normal relations between Berlin and Chongqing, and Germany does not want to take any actions in the Far East that may hinder German-Soviet relations. The Soviet government has clearly stated that it will continue to assist Jiang Wei Yuanzhang, so even if there is a Tripartite Pact, Germany does not intend to recognize the Nanjing organization.

Japan's Judgment of the Soviet Union is Wrong

Washington　The news from Moscow that the Soviet Union's policy toward China has not changed has aroused satisfaction among people here, as it confirms the belief held by the general public that inserting anti-communist clauses in the Japanese-Xie agreement is useless and harmful. Moscow's announcement of its policy is the first result of Japan's misjudgment. Observers here believe that

### Knox Will Inspect Naval Exercises　Has Left the Canal Zone Yesterday

Panama City　US Naval Secretary Knox flew from here to Puerto Rico this morning. It is expected that he will inspect the US naval exercises with President Roosevelt. Panamanian President Aris hosted a banquet for Knox last night. (Haitong dispatch on the 7th)

Cristobal　Naval Secretary Knox left Cocosovi in the Canal Zone yesterday morning with several senior naval officers. According to the Navy Department, it had thoroughly inspected the submarine and air force bases in the area. (United Press dispatch on the 7th)Because Moscow has this statement, Japan will not be able to withdraw the troops that must be stationed on the border of the three northeastern provinces due to Japanese-Soviet relations.

There Are Signs of Another Change in the Japanese Cabinet

Given the current situation, the new Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Tatekawa, may not have the opportunity to promote Japanese-Soviet rapprochement, and Berlin's failure to persuade Moscow to compromise with Japan will also affect Japan's belief in the power of the Axis powers. This fact, coupled with the defeat of the Italian army and the failure of Germany's invasion of Britain, will increase the troubles of the Konoe Cabinet. Dissatisfaction with Konoe's policies is gradually growing within Japan, and Foreign Minister Matsuoka's diplomatic efforts have not been successful. This is probably a sign that the Tokyo government will soon undergo another change.

The Army and Navy Have Different Dreams

Those with knowledge believe that internal divisions in Japan are too great to advance deeply and realize their imperial dreams. Moreover, according to private information, the opinions of the Japanese army and navy are becoming increasingly divided. The navy is afraid that the army will repeat the incident of 1938, so it has to keep several warships in Tokyo Bay and set up cannons to control the army barracks on the shore.

### British and American Financial Officials Will Meet Again Tomorrow　Roosevelt Decides to Ask Congress to Reinterpret the Aid to Britain Policy

Washington　British Financial Secretary Phillips said yesterday that he is currently compiling a balance sheet of British income and expenditure for US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau to review. Phillips refused to acknowledge rumors that Britain was asking the United States for a loan, saying that the 35-minute meeting with Morgenthau was only to present Britain's resources, income, and supply expenses, and did not mention the war debt issue. Someone asked whether to consider selling Britain's territories in the Americas to the United States in order to obtain US dollars. Phillips replied that this matter was not within his jurisdiction and said that he would meet with Morgenthau again on Sunday. According to unofficial estimates, Britain's total assets in the United States are between 40 billion and 50 billion US dollars, and Britain is currently purchasing 10 billion yuan each year. (United Press dispatch on the 17th)

Washington　Sir Frederick Phillips, the British Treasury representative, told visiting reporters yesterday that he plans to stay in Washington, New York, and Canada for a week. In future meetings with the US Treasury Secretary, many issues will be discussed. A reporter asked whether the issue of unpaid British debt had been mentioned in yesterday's meeting with the US Treasury Secretary. He replied in the negative. (Reuters dispatch on the 7th)

Washington　Senior officials here revealed yesterday that President Roosevelt has decided to ask Congress to reinterpret the US financial and other aspects of the aid to Britain policy. After US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau met with the British Financial Secretary and requested a "balance sheet" of national property for another meeting to be held on Sunday, the President's request was announced. It is understood that US Treasury Secretary has also discussed with Argentinian Ambassador to the United States Espil and Argentinian Central Bank Manager Prebish about the 100 million US dollar loan to Argentina. According to government sources, this loan will be used as a model for lending other loans to Latin America. It is generally said that the purpose of this loan is to make Argentina more closely linked to the US Western Hemisphere defense plan. It is expected that Treasury Secretary Morgenthau and Secretary of State Hull will obtain a detailed report on the loans required by Britain when Roosevelt returns to Washington, so as to avoid the many proposals for the Johnson Act and the Neutrality Act (such as a large loan to Canada) that have been submitted. However, it is rumored that President Roosevelt told his advisors that what he wanted was only to ask Congress to make a clear explanation of what kind of assistance the US government would give to Britain. It is understood that President Roosevelt intends to submit this case to the new Congress that will meet in January next year. (International News Agency dispatch on the 7th)

Editorial

### Rumors of Germany Inducing Peace with Greece

The day before yesterday, just as Italian troops were continuing to retreat from the Albanian front, news suddenly came that Germany intended to entrust Turkey to mediate the Italian-Greek war, and that a peace plan had been submitted to Greece by the Turkish Foreign Minister. The news was issued by an American news agency, but its source was in the capitals of Hungary and Yugoslavia. The news from the Yugoslav capital was obtained through the Turkish side involved. Assuming that this news is somewhat true, it seems that this is the umpteenth peace offensive from the Axis powers. As of last night, the countries concerned had neither confirmed nor denied this rumor. It is possible that a formal denial will be issued in a day or two. But even if it is denied, the rumor cannot but make one suspect that there is a reason for it. Moreover, denials of all peace offensives are often a tactic used to cover up failure after hitting a wall.

Looking at the peace offensives repeatedly adopted by some belligerent countries in the world today, there are generally three types: (1) attempting to weaken the enemy's fighting spirit, and therefore sometimes becoming a smokescreen for intensified attacks or feints; (2) merely creating an atmosphere, with the intention of undermining the enemy's foreign relations or alienating the enemy's internal unity; (3) sometimes the initiators of peace offensives do have some intention of seeking peace, but often because they are unwilling to take the right path, they are climbing trees to catch fish, and the more they seek, the further they get. The first two types are poisonous tactics, and the last type is a major error in method. Although their natures are different, the failure is the same. If the rumor of Germany's inducement of peace with Greece is true, is its intention to break up the Anglo-Greek alliance? Or to prepare for future assistance in the war? Or is it truly aware of the difficulty of the Balkan war and willing to compromise to avoid the deterioration of the situation? This is a mystery that can be unraveled within a few days.

Let us explore why this rumor of inducement of peace has attracted attention and why it is suspected of being somewhat true. The main reasons are no more than two: one is the unexpected failure of the Italian military, and the other is the unexpected delay of German assistance. Because the Italian army can be said to have never won from the beginning, even the people most sympathetic to the Blackshirts cannot help but start to worry about whether it can turn defeat into victory. Because of Germany's coyness, sometimes assuring Turkey that it will not participate in the Balkan war, and sometimes declaring that it will not withdraw its expatriates within Greece, it makes people suspect that the Berlin authorities have been restrained by the Soviet Union and Bulgaria has sabotaged them, and it seems that they are somewhat retreating in the face of difficulty. Of course, these various expressions may only be acting, and in fact they may evolve into actual assistance in the war at any time. However, judging from the reality of the Italian military's failure in combat alone, it is undeniable that the National Socialist government cannot feel excited at the moment.

The Greek troops who have entered Albanian territory can be divided into three routes in general: (1) After occupying the Koriça Heights in the north, they divided their troops into two branches, one heading north and capturing the city of Pogradec in one fell swoop, and then advancing northwest from the city, reportedly reaching a small village 18 kilometers from Elbasan and 42 kilometers from the Albanian capital. One branch advanced northwest and occupied the city of Moschopolis, which can easily echo each other to threaten the oil fields between the Devol River and the Shkumbin River. (2) The central route is advancing along the Vjosë River and has occupied the port of Përmet in the upper reaches of the river. In the future, it will be heading west along the river to capture the ports of Klisura and Tepelenë, and then directly attacking the coastal port of Vlorë. (3) The southern route is a joint operation by the army and navy, which has occupied the port of Sarandë at the southwestern tip of Albania. This is an even more important victory than the conquest of the Koriça Heights, because it is said that the joint fleet of Britain and Greece will use the port as a base to harass southern Italy in the future. In addition, there is talk that the city of Gjirokastër has also fallen, and the city of Delvinë is under a two-pronged attack. It is widely rumored that the Italian troops in this area are retreating along the coast towards the port of Himarë.

Based on the above explanation of the war situation, although it is not敢 to determine Greece's inevitable victory, it can at least be said that the Blackshirts have suffered a complete defeat. According to the observations of British military experts, Greece cannot seize the final victory without occupying the ports of Vlorë and Durrës in Albania. Therefore, for the sake of Greece, it still seems that it should continue to pursue the victory. Germany's peace offensive may be a delaying tactic to allow the Blackshirts to make a comeback. In that case, wouldn't the hard battle of the Athens government be in vain? What's more, the successive resignations of General Badoglio, the Chief of Staff of the Italian Army, and the Governor of the Italian Dodecanese Islands, can be seen as Mussolini's preparation to step up the war on the one hand, but at the same time, it can reflect the lack of talent in the Italian military authorities, which is not the best opportunity for the Greek government to take advantage of its victory?

### Shi Yousan Executed by Firing Squad

Cheqing: Shi Yousan's nature was frivolous, capricious, and prone to change. Although he had accumulated merit as a junior soldier to the rank of a Lieutenant Colonel, he always felt that he could not fully express his wild nature. Therefore, he took advantage of opportunities to arbitrarily expand his forces to satisfy his private ambitions. Our central government has always been magnanimous, pardoning past misdeeds, and entrusting him with responsibilities, hoping that he would render meritorious service in the area north and south of the Yellow River. Unexpectedly, his old habits did not change, and his wild nature remained untamed. Recently, he has been insincere and disobedient to the central government's operational orders. His younger brother, Shi Youxin, also engaged in many illegal activities. The central government could no longer tolerate him. To leave such a degenerate element would only undermine military discipline. Therefore, the Commander of the Guard was ordered to execute him by firing squad on the 4th and 5th of this month, to uphold military law. (7th dispatch)

### Germany and France Sign Economic Agreement; Removing Trade Barriers; Starting Point for Cooperation Between the Two Countries

Vichy: The head of the German trade delegation, Dr. Koons, announced yesterday that Germany and France had signed an economic agreement to remove trade barriers between the two countries. Dr. Koons said that the agreement stipulates "an exchange rate of twenty francs equals one mark and guarantees the fair position of French industry in postwar Europe." At the same time, the French government suggested a quick implementation of the September 1934 agreement. The agreement had been delayed for four years by the French lower house until it was approved in the spring of 1939, but it was not implemented due to the war. The German-French economic agreement not only applies to France but also to the commerce of the continent. The exchange rate of twenty francs to one mark took effect on July 25, the day after the agreement was signed. Before the agreement, repayments were based on an exchange rate of 16.25 francs to one mark. Dr. Koons stated, "France should not have overly high expectations for this agreement. "This kind of agreement is only the beginning of cooperation. Experts will study procedures to increase commercial exchange with this new agreement." Dr. Koons also said, "Germany is currently at war. Due to the needs of the defense industry, it cannot make large-scale industrial production to France. France should wait for the signing of the peace treaty, and then establish a statutory basis for restoring relations. He claimed that through our two countries' cooperation in tomorrow's Europe, productivity will not be ignored, and France will also obtain a just position." (7th United Press dispatch)

### Another Important Town in Southwestern Albania Falls: Greek Army Captures It, Establishing a Strong Foothold Along the Coast; Central Greek Forces Approach Elbasan

Athens - The major southwestern Albanian city of Argyrokastron has been captured by the Greek army, according to news received here yesterday. It is said that Italian forces withdrew from the city in succession over the past four to eight hours, completing their evacuation on Thursday night. Greek aircraft bombed Valona and Clisura yesterday. Greek newspapers claim that the advancing Greek forces are now gradually threatening the oil region between the Teveli and Shushica rivers, which is said to be the sole source of oil supply for Italy. The fall of Argyrokastron will weaken the entire Italian right flank, as the Greek army has not only occupied Santi Quaranta but is also approaching the town of Telvino between Argyrokastron and the coast. On the northern front outside Blemendes, the Greek army is now pursuing the Italian forces, forcing them to retreat via Clisura towards Tepelene. (Reuters, 7th)

Nanking - According to private sources, not yet officially confirmed, Greek forces, after a fierce offensive, occupied the Albanian town of Argyrokastron yesterday. Both sides suffered heavy losses. The Greek army is now continuing its advance north. It is reported that Greek forces also occupied the villages of Marina and Tarapinza yesterday morning and the night before. Southwest of Moschopolis, Greek forces have occupied Mount Vostrovia and are continuing to advance towards Berat. (Haitong, 7th)

Struga, Yugoslavia - Greek soldiers, wielding sharp weapons and fighting fiercely in the mountainous region northwest of Lake Ohrid, yesterday pushed the Italian forces back to a point just 18 kilometers from Elbasan. This advance yesterday was one of the most important battles of the Italo-Greek War. The Greek army has launched a fierce offensive towards Elbasan from several routes, attempting to reach the city and cut off the route to this important city, which is only 24 miles from Tirana. It is reported that the Greek army, having occupied Blemendes, has rendered the Italian coastal outlet of Valona useless. The Greeks also point out that the resignation of Italian Chief of General Staff General Badoglio is sufficient proof that the Italian army has acknowledged the losses it has suffered in Greece and Albania. The Athenians also consider the Greek army's occupation of Santi Quaranta the day before, which gives the Greek army a strong foothold for advancing north and progressing along the Albanian coast, to be important. (United Press, 7th)

Struga - Greek troops, crossing the mountains west of the Mokra mountain range, occupied a small village 18 kilometers southeast of Elbasan yesterday. Elbasan is an important town in central Albania, only 24 kilometers from Tirana. In addition, Greek forces are advancing towards Fushë-Bulqizë and Hashash, attempting to cut off the Elbasan highway. After occupying Blemendes in the center (20 kilometers northeast of Argyrokastron), the Greek forces captured seven Italian officers, 200 soldiers, three tanks, two trucks, and two light field guns on the highway. The Greek army immediately split into two teams to pursue. The left wing advanced seven kilometers on Thursday, seemingly towards the confluence of the Konizza and Viosa rivers. The right wing has advanced ten kilometers northeast. It is reported that the Greek forces in Moschopolis have crossed the pass of Mount Opari, 25 kilometers west of the town, and are slowly advancing towards the village of Skima. (United Press, 7th)

Constant Stream of Good News from the Northern and Southern Fronts: Greek Military Strategy Proves Effective

Athens - The Greek army is fighting more and more fiercely. Following the successive captures of Korçë and Pogradec in northern Albania, news has arrived of the fall of the key town of Blemendes. Argyrokastron, the last supply base for the Italian army in southern Albania, and Santi Quaranta, where Italian troop transport ships docked two months ago, have now both fallen into Greek hands. According to reports here, the Italian forces in Argyrokastron had completely withdrawn by Thursday night. However, the Greek army, according to the pre-determined plan of the commander-in-chief, continued to pursue the defeated army, while Rome is making every effort to try to reverse the defeat. General Badoglio, who previously conquered Albania, has now been dismissed from his post as commander-in-chief of the Italian army. This is the second major change in the Italian command since the start of the Italo-Greek War. According to the latest battle reports from the front, the Italian army is still rapidly retreating along the coastal road starting from Santi Quaranta towards the small port of Chimara. The Italian forces northwest of Blemendes are also abandoning the city and retreating. However, British and Greek air forces have destroyed bridges and roads behind the Italian lines, making the Italian retreat extremely difficult. The Greek military strategy is clever, avoiding the direct center of Argyrokastron, and this strategy is now gradually proving effective. In this line, the Greek army now holds the most important peaks. Elbasan is a key town, a junction of roads in central Albania, directly connected to the largest port of Durazzo. The Italian army has deployed new positions in the past few days, hoping to resist in Chimara and Tepelene, but their hope of holding the second or third line of defense now seems to be fading. If the several divisions of the Italian army retreating from the southwest fail to put up the resistance they hope for, part of the Italian army may retreat to Elbasan, but Elbasan is now gradually feeling the threat from the Greek army to the northeast. In the past few days, thousands of Italian soldiers have been captured, but there is no official report from the palace. Whether this number will increase significantly will depend on how the Italian forces near Argyrokastron conduct their rearguard action. The Italian army's resistance has not been weak, and many officers have been killed and captured. It is reported that the famous 48th Regiment and others also helped defend Argyrokastron. According to the latest news from the Lake Ohrid front, the Greek army has now crossed eight miles past Pogradec. Yesterday afternoon, the first batch of Greek troops entered the city of Argyrokastron, capturing many war materials such as four heavy guns and mountain guns and machine guns, and capturing a large Italian army unit. The Italian army is now retreating along the entire northern front, while the Greek army is advancing along the valleys of the Shushica, Teveli, and Viosa rivers towards Elbasan and Berat. In the past two days, 300 Italian and Albanian soldiers have surrendered to the Allied authorities, all saying that the Italian army is becoming increasingly chaotic and unable to maintain its power in Albania.

Greek Troops Enter Santi Quaranta: Albanian and Greek People Vie to Welcome the Royal Army

Athens - A Greek government spokesman recently declared that Santi Quaranta can now serve as a valuable base for the Allied fleet to attack southern Italy. Regarding the occupation of Argyrokastron, the official here has not yet formally announced it, and the spokesman also said that the area has been completely occupied by the Greek army, and he cannot confirm that Santi Quaranta, which has been completely occupied by the Greek army, has been renamed "Aghioi Saranda" (meaning "Forty Martyrs") by the Greeks. The base that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini used to attack Greece has now been occupied by the Greek army and will be used by the British and Greek Allied forces to attack Italy. Italian troops have now retreated from Argyrokastron towards Deleto飞, so it can be said that the Greek army has already controlled the southern border of Albania. On Friday morning, the main force of the Greek army, led by captured Italian armored vehicles flying the blue and white Greek flag, entered the strategically important port of Santi Quaranta in three mighty columns. The Greek people of the area lined the streets, waving their handkerchiefs and cheering to welcome the Greek army. The Albanians, initially worried because they did not know how the Greek army would treat them, soon rushed into the streets and joined the Greek residents in offering food and drink to welcome the royal army, cheering the Greek army and chanting slogans for national independence. There was still a large sailing ship moored in the harbor, and an Italian destroyer sunk in the water. Greek artillery continuously fired from the mountain peaks near the city, covering the port in a network of artillery fire to prevent the Italian army from escaping by sea. The range of the Greek heavy artillery had reached Likursi, one mile south of Santi Quaranta, on Thursday evening, so the Greek army's occupation of this important Italian naval base became certain. Greek artillery also vigorously bombarded Italian military transport ships, hindering Italian transport. (United Press, 7th)

Italian Army Changes Commanders in Attempt to Reverse the Decline: Preparing for a Counter-Offensive Against Greece

Athens - Greek political observers yesterday believed that the transfer of Chief of General Staff Marshal Badoglio was sufficient to indicate that the Italian military had friction with the Fascist Party leaders. Observers also believe that this move is sufficient to indicate that the war against Greece under the leadership of the Italian High Command has failed. (United Press, 7th)

Rome - Yesterday, it was generally expected that the Italian army would launch an early counter-offensive in Albania and continue to advance into Egypt, as General Cavallero has been appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Italian army, replacing General Badoglio. Although General Cavallero came from humble beginnings, he is the well-known reorganizer of the Italian army. It is expected that Cavallero will soon command a large-scale offensive against Greece and Egypt. The official reason for the change of commander has not been announced, but it is generally regarded as a sign that a major offensive is imminent. (International Telegram, 7th)

Rome - Knowledgeable observers here believe that General Cavallero's succession of General Badoglio as Chief of Staff indicates that the Fascist Party will adopt a more radical policy, similar to the party's "March on Rome" in the past. Although Badoglio's resignation is not entirely the same as the German change of the General Staff in 1938, Mussolini has clearly recognized that the commander of the military must have absolute and consistent resonance with those who hold the reins of government. The new Chief of Staff Cavallero will soon hold a meeting with German Army Commander General Keitel. Sources predict that Cavallero will soon go to the Albanian front for inspection and will hold a meeting with Commander Graziani of the Italian East African Army in Italy in a few days to discuss the Italian plan to attack Egypt. Preparations for the war in the region have been completed, and the two transport systems have been completed. Cavallero is a blitzkrieg tactician who reorganized the Italian army in 1925 and advocated increasing the speed of the navy. General Badoglio remains as the head of the National Research Institute, in charge of scientific and military research. Cavallero was the first army commander appointed after Mussolini took power, and was a strong general in the previous Italo-Turkish War, the First European War, and the Abyssinian War. (United Press, 7th)

Another Famous Italian Military Figure: Governor Rossi of the Dodecanese Islands Resigns

London - According to the official Italian news agency, another famous Italian military figure, Governor General Rossi of the Dodecanese Islands, has also resigned. It is said that Rossi's resignation will cause great shock to the Italian people and will be regarded as evidence of a split between the Fascist Party and the army. One of the most unusual events in the Albanian war before has been the frequent transfer of Italian army commanders, about one per week. According to neutral sources in Rome, Mussolini recently held several meetings with his commanders, blaming each other for the failure in Greece. (Reuters, 7th)

Rome - It is declared here that Governor General Rossi of the Italian Dodecanese Islands has resigned and will be succeeded by General Bastico, who will also command the garrison of the islands. Bastico is 64 years old and participated in the Italo-Turkish War from 1911 to 1912. During the last World War, he presided over the military academy. He achieved remarkable results in the Italian-Ethiopian War. He also participated in the Spanish Civil War. (Haitong, 7th)

Tragic History of the European War (4)

### The Inside Story of Daladier and Reynaud's Affair of State Involving a Woman

May 6th, I met Reynaud and found him dispirited and often absent-minded. His desk was equipped with three telephones: one connected to the cabinet, one to the outside world, and one directly to the Countess de Portes' private chamber. The last one rang incessantly. Reynaud would pick up the receiver, listen for only a second, and then impatiently exclaim, "Yes... yes, of course... but I beg you, let me do some work..."

Finally, he simply stopped answering it.

Later, the situation in Norway deteriorated daily. The superior equipment of the German army was beginning to show its power. The Germans' prior preparations were meticulous and exhaustive, while France responded hastily, leaving brave soldiers exposed to enemy planes, bombs, and machine guns due to a lack of anti-aircraft guns. The difference between the two sides was like heaven and earth. Even the most optimistic people felt as if cold water had been poured on them, and their hearts grew weary. Reynaud believed that France's lack of preparation, leading to this unfortunate situation, was the responsibility of his political enemies.

He told me that they were deceiving each other, even withholding a pair of letters from Admiral Darlan from him. The letters detailed the difficulties. If he had known earlier, he could have avoided it. "This afternoon, I will attend the Senate committee, and I will reveal all the truth to them."

At this time, the conflict between Daladier and Reynaud intensified, so much so that President Lebrun had to intervene and act as a mediator.

At 9:00 AM on May 10th, I was preparing to go to the countryside for a vacation. However, at 8:30 AM, I heard on the radio that the German army had invaded the Netherlands and Belgium. The general offensive had begun. Those on vacation were recalled to camp, and I went to the North Station, preparing to return to the Arras defense line. The train added several cars, but British and French soldiers were still crammed in. I heard an infantry captain nearby saying goodbye to his wife. He said:

"My dear, listen! There is money in the left-hand drawer of the glass wardrobe, and some change in the drawer of the bedside table. You can take them all. The keys to the garage and the car door are in my room, on the tea tray on top of the drawer chest. Ask [someone named] Bede to put some mothballs in my clothes after I take them off. The pedals of [someone named] Qinhen's bicycle are making squeaking noises; they need some oil. What did you say? These past two days have gone by so quickly? That's right, if we can stop the enemy, the war might end here."

His wife smiled, looking brave. It is incorrect to say that the morale of France had declined before the offensive began. The upper classes and those with inside information may have been discouraged, but the general public was still full of hope, further numbed by the radio broadcasts eight times a day.

The news of the German army breaking through the French lines at Sedan came like a bolt from the blue, completely unexpected by the citizens of Paris. They prepared to consider evacuation if necessary. They had gained ample experience in 1914, and they believed that the enemy's offensive would soon be contained. By May 17th, a column of German mechanized troops had advanced directly towards Laon. Gamelin advised the government that he could no longer guarantee the defense of Paris beyond that night. On this day, internal chaos and panic reached their peak.

Early the next morning, the citizens of Paris heard that the German army had turned towards the English Channel, knowing that they had a few days of respite. At this critical juncture, Reynaud suddenly gained courage and resolutely implemented the actions he had repeatedly delayed. He believed that Gamelin was responsible for the failure and insisted on replacing him. Because Daladier strongly defended Gamelin, Reynaud transferred Daladier to the position of Minister of Foreign Affairs, taking over the Ministry of War himself. As for who would be the new commander-in-chief, Reynaud had long intended to appoint Georges, but he was afraid that Gamelin would be too humiliated. The animosity between Gamelin and Georges was no less than that between Reynaud and Daladier!

A British general once said, "They are so busy with internal strife that they naturally have no time to fight the Germans!"

In addition, General Noguès, who had achieved remarkable military achievements in Morocco and North Africa, also had hopes of being selected. Among the young generals, Huningue and Giraud both had supporters within their ranks. Huningue was resourceful and had led his troops in staunch resistance against the German army. Giraud was also an outstanding general, but he was captured at that time because he relied on his courage and underestimated the enemy. Reynaud finally decided to transfer General Weygand, the commander of the French forces in the Near East, and urgently called him back to Paris. In 1918, Weygand's military rank was second only to General Foch. Foch took command of the army when the war situation was critical and turned defeat into victory. Since Weygand had worked with him, Reynaud naturally wanted to draw on his experience.

At the same time, Reynaud offered the position of Vice-Premier to the veteran Pétain.

In the eyes of most French people, Pétain's reputation was so great that no one else could compare to him. His dignified appearance, tall stature, and cold expression left a deep impression on those who met him. Of the six generals who had achieved glorious victories in the last World War, only two were still alive: Foch and Pétain. Although he was already eighty-four years old, he was still energetic and vigorous, inspiring even greater respect and awe.

Reynaud summoned Pétain to the cabinet as an assistant, believing that by relying on his great name, he could strengthen his own position and unite national opinion. Unexpectedly, his new colleague proved to be merely a figurehead, and he realized that he had miscalculated. He had only found a successor and his own judge.

On June 6th, Daladier completely withdrew from the political stage, and the conflict between Reynaud and him finally came to an end. Just a few months earlier, Daladier was the master of France, wielding great power and enjoying immense popularity. Once a sudden wave arose, he was swept away without a trace. When he quietly disappeared, he did not express any remorse or surprise.

General Gamelin, who had long been under Daladier's protection, had also retired to his home, living in a quiet villa on Foch Avenue. He wore civilian clothes and was busy typing, preparing to write a memoir defending himself.

When General Gamelin was in power, a female friend of his family, who still did not forget their old friendship when they fell from power, went to see Madame Gamelin before leaving Paris. She found Madame Gamelin's attitude still extremely calm and composed.

Madame Gamelin said, "The General and I live together. He doesn't think about himself, only about France and his former subordinates. He greatly admires General Weygand and hopes that he can stop the enemy."

She pointed to a room, revealing that she was a gentle and virtuous woman who deeply loved her husband. We had been to the room before, where a portrait of Gamelin as a child, painted by his mother, hung on the wall. He was wearing long clothes and playing a copper drum, looking very lively and lovely.

She excitedly said, "Do you hear that? That's the sound of his little typewriter."

The above-mentioned are all serious conflicts between individuals, which have caused great difficulties in the conduct of the war. Although such infighting has existed in all dynasties, jealousy and ambition are inherent in human nature. In 1914, Clemenceau and Poincaré also had disagreements, but France finally achieved victory. At that time, the officials in charge were of high moral character and had a strong sense of patriotism, so they were able to overcome their personal desires. Poincaré, although he did not like Clemenceau, was able to cooperate with him loyally. Pétain also humbled himself and accepted Foch's command. The situation in France in 1940 was different. Factions were divided, and resentment was extreme. Public morality had declined, and personal hatred was unchecked. Although disregarding personal issues, the main reason for France's failure was that Britain and France lacked preparation in military, diplomatic, and industrial affairs. However, the officials were openly and secretly fighting, and there was no strong leader to unify the country. The military also lost the last chance to resist. (The End)

### The Lawless Rice Weevils of the Grain Market: Only Interested in Dragging Rice to the Market
### Making a Fortune the Quickest Way is Rice... Buy Today, Earn Tomorrow
### Life is Most Difficult Due to Rice... This Morning One Sheng, Now Half the Value

Nearly 20,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Arrived Yesterday, Another 70,000 Bags Will Arrive Soon
Therefore, There is No Shortage of Rice, Only a Lack of Price Stabilization

Shanghai rice prices are constantly rising, with rumors that the source will become scarce, but the reality is just the opposite. A large amount of foreign rice is still arriving in Shanghai. The Jardine Matheson & Co.'s ship "Daily Rise" brought 9,290 bags from Hong Kong, and the company's "Morning Star" also transported 10,070 bags from Hong Kong, arriving yesterday and unloading at the Roosevelt Wharf. In addition, the Taikoo Dockyard & Engineering Company's "Canton" ship also arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, bringing 9,021 bags from Hong Kong and unloading at the company's wharf in the French Concession. Yesterday, the three ships brought a total of 18,381 bags of foreign rice. It is reported that the French company "Dad Nan" directly shipped 70,000 bags of foreign rice from Saigon, which is expected to arrive next Tuesday. (Zu)

The rice market is soaring, because there is no effective management method. No matter how much is advocated, it is no match for the powerful speculative groups. If you want to curb the low rice price, the rice price is still rising day by day. Yesterday, there was a rumor of changing to ordering rice from Burma. Speculators and rice merchants also fabricated that the price of rice in Rangoon had risen by three yuan, with the intention of shaking people's hearts and raising the price of rice. Since the daily rise, as long as you buy it today, you can enjoy a profit of several yuan overnight. Therefore, they only buy it and are unwilling to sell it. As a result, the price of rice only rises and does not fall back. Although Shanghai is a prosperous city, most households do not have a stone of storage and people do not have overnight grain. Due to the rice market being controlled by groups, the social unrest is progressing at the same rate as the rice price rise. How can the working class not be poor and cold today? It is difficult to survive. Yesterday, Saigon No. 1 was 89.5 yuan and 88 yuan, No. 2 was 84 yuan and 83 yuan, fire-milled was 88 yuan to 83 yuan, No. 2 mixed was 81.7 yuan and 81 yuan, small-milled was 80.05 yuan and 80 yuan, rice chaff was 76.5 yuan, broken rice was 73 yuan, medium was 70.05 yuan, Tokyo polished was 80.05 yuan, Wuhu pointed was 79.5 yuan and 78 yuan, and all spot rice rose by 2 yuan. The English-Chinese company's No. 1 spot price opened at 103 yuan, then to 104.2 yuan. No. 2 on the 12th also reached 95.5 yuan and 96 yuan, the small-milled price was only 90.05 yuan, and then rose sharply to 92 yuan. In the afternoon, Dingtai Bank suddenly threw out 1,000 tons of Saigon No. 2, priced at 88 yuan, which was shipped from late January to early February. Therefore, the public's sentiment was slightly stabilized in the afternoon, and the total transaction of spot goods for the whole day was no less than 20,000 bags, and the term road was 600 to 700 tons.

The selling price of thick and thin japonica rice is high, and the sales are average. Therefore, the cargo owner wants to make a profit but is unable to. As a result, the price has increased by several yuan. Kai Kunshan rice quoted white japonica at 100 yuan and 97 yuan. Qingjiao thin original package was 95-96 yuan, and polished was 91.5 yuan and 90.05 yuan.

The domestic glutinous rice is flat due to high prices, and the goods from Hong Kong are quite popular, and the price has also increased by one yuan. Kai Lier was 100 yuan, medium was 98 yuan, Hong Kong was 89 yuan and 87 yuan, and glutinous green bean was 77 yuan to 73 yuan.

### Australian Flour Sales are Most Active

Yesterday, the price of foreign flour rebounded again. After the previous two days of tending to be flat, yesterday, with the price of rice rising again, the local customers' sales were quite active. The price of Australian foreign flour, with the brands "Clock Tower" and "Flower and Bird," rose again to 20.2 yuan. Road cargo also needs 19.95 yuan to 20 yuan. The high-grade Australian flour has reached 20.05 yuan, which is two to three corners tighter than the previous day. The road cargo of foreign flour will arrive in the middle of next week, with a total of more than 200,000 bags. Most of them have been sold in advance, so the market is still stable. As for the Chinese factory flour, more than 6,000 bags have been sold, all of which must be purchased by the designated flour shops, and the flat price is still 18 yuan.

Yesterday, wheat was still calm, but the market gradually improved. Because the source of rice in the mainland was blocked, and foreign wheat could not be fully supplied for a while, everyone's sentiment was firm. It is heard that a certain factory's pre-ordered foreign wheat will arrive soon. The factory is waiting for the foreign wheat raw materials to arrive for use, otherwise it will be difficult to start work. Therefore, the flour factory's business this year is no longer comparable to the past. Currently, the market price of Du wheat has reached 30 yuan, and the trading is only in negotiation.

### Finance: Few Transactions, Little Activity, Stable Foreign Exchange

Yesterday's foreign exchange market, Zou Feng quoted prices, all without ups and downs. In the British and American black markets, there was a softness in the quietness. With the Hong Kong Telegraph Company's absorption, banks settled, and the selling was inferior to the buying. Still, because American banks provided abundant supply, the shortage was limited. Speculators made few moves, mostly watching. By noon closing, both British and American views were slightly softened. The spot price of British gold was 3 pence 7835, and the US exchange rate was 5.96875. The forward prices were still pulling apart.

The US Exchange Rate Returns Below 6 Yuan

In the early morning, because the London big bars, both near and far term, grew by 0.0625, the New York silver price was still flat, and the London raw gold was stagnant, the exchange rates for British to US to Shanghai, etc., were flat, and the US to British to Shanghai, etc., were also unchanged. The central listing of various exchanges remained the same as before. The bank opened the spot selling price in the morning, British gold at 3 pence 796875, and the US exchange rate at 6 yuan, both the same as the closing price the previous night. After opening, the Hong Kong Telegraph Company purchased, and the market immediately became soft. At that time, the American bank settled with the Hong Kong Telegraph Company for the US exchange rate of 5.96875 for this month. The HSBC listing revealed that the opening was not moving, and the silver balance tax announcement was increased by 0.50 percent. Afterwards, Chinese merchants and others also absorbed, but American banks continued to sell, and foreign banks were willing to supply, and the market recovered. It is estimated that the opening price for this month's US exchange rate was 6 yuan. By noon, because Chinese banks and others had a strong appetite, the situation was still tight. The closing price for spot goods and this month's British gold was 3 pence 78125, the US exchange rate was 5.96875, the next month's British gold was 3 pence 765625, and the US exchange rate was 5.9375, which was 0.015625 tighter for British gold and 0.03125 narrower for the US exchange rate than the spot goods on the previous day and the British gold for this month. In the afternoon, there was no market on Saturday.

Hong Kong's US Exchange Rate Eased Yesterday

Hong Kong, 7th (Saturday), the exchange market opened calmly this morning, and the British, American, and Japanese exchange rates all remained unchanged.

### Gold Market Continues to Rise

Yesterday's spot gold black market situation was mediocre, and because there were not many transactions in the half-day on Saturday, the ups and downs were also narrow, but the price was quite firm.

### Financial Review - December 7th -

- By Saint-Catherine

China-US Financial Cooperation

The news that the United States would actively provide China with economic assistance, which was circulated in mid-October, has been concretely confirmed in the voices of so-called "Nanjing government" signed by Japan. At the end of November, US President Roosevelt announced: The United States will lend China US$100 million, half of which will be used for general purposes, and half of which will be used to protect China's monetary system and maintain Sino-US currency relations. On December 2, the US Senate Banking Committee and the House of Representatives Monetary Committee unanimously approved the US lending China US$100 million. Half of this amount is allocated by the Export-Import Bank, and half is allocated from the Treasury Equalization Fund.

According to telegrams, the method of this loan, regarding the allocation of the Export-Import Bank, is for general purposes. According to the letter from Mr. Pus, the special commissioner of the Central Debt, to President Roosevelt, the subsidiary organization of the Gold Reserve Corporation, the Five Gold Reserve Corporation, is now continuing to order tungsten, antimony, tin, and other items from the China Resources Committee, with a value of 60 million yuan. The goods will be delivered in the next few years at the price suitable for the market conditions at the time of delivery. However, in order to help China cope with its current financial problems, the Export-Import Bank of the United States has agreed to lend China 50 million yuan, guaranteed by the Central Bank of China, and offset by the above-mentioned order of five gold. It can be seen that it is a commercial credit loan, which is the same as the first and second Shinagawa loans in the way of lending, but different in the way of using it. The credit loans of US$25 million on December 15, 1938, and US$20 million on March 7, 1940, were used to transfer the purchase of US agricultural products, hardware, gasoline, trucks, road construction machines, mining machines, smelting machines, and other raw materials necessary for construction, while this loan is to assist China in coping with current financial problems. The credit loan of the third loan (September 26, 1940) is not only the same in the way of lending, but also similar in the way of using it, because the official documents of the United States state that the US government lent China US$25 million to maintain China's foreign exchange needs.

The reason, regarding the allocation of the Treasury Equalization Fund, is for the purpose of stabilizing legal tender. According to US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau on the 2nd, the government has not yet decided on all the details of stabilizing legal tender, but this plan will undoubtedly follow the current negotiations with Mr. Song Ziwen to purchase legal tender at a certain rate. The detailed content will not be officially announced by the United States until the talks are established in Washington and Mr. Song Ziwen does not agree to disclose them. At the same time, Mr. Moore solemnly stated that the Equalization Fund will only engage in small stabilization work, which is neither a loan nor credit to China, but only purchases legal tender in US dollars.

(To be continued) Large, most of them were eaten up by financial market prices, and more than 2 million were continuously sold on the market, but they were never able to lower the market price, which shows the strong purchasing power. The transactions were flat in the morning, and the market price was slightly weak. Xinfusheng said that there was a rush to sell, and Hongda Lianhe and others also sold, and Yongchang Renkang Hengfu Lianyi Tongkang all bought in. The selling was more vigorous, so it continued to weaken by one or two corners. In the afternoon, the trend first weakened and then became firm. Category C rose from 3.25 yuan to 5.5 corners. After the closing, it was suddenly rumored that there was hope for the establishment of a British loan, and the black market rose by two or three corners. Xie Xingyuan strongly covered the short position, and Defu Lianhe and Lianyi also bought a lot. Wuyuan Renchang Xiekang also had needs, and the sellers were relatively weak. Tongkang Sheng sold more, and Sankai Shuntai Cunyi sold slightly. As a result, the counterattack rose by 5 corners to 6 corners, with Category D rising sharply by 6 corners the most. Most of them were taken by Defu Company, and the transaction was about 2.34 million yuan. The following is a brief table,

Category Highest Lowest Closing Change from Previous Day

### Yarn and Cotton: Cotton Yarn Bulls Enthusiastically Active

The yarn market is firm, and the rising wind is spiraling upwards. This is because the bulls are enthusiastically active. Therefore, although there are large households selling in large quantities, the buyers have a very strong appetite, and the amount sold is small. It is almost completely searched and depleted, so the trend is tighter. At the same time, in Hong Kong, the actual transactions are still constantly lacking. The procurement of various yarns is more than yesterday. Today, 1,250 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.

Double Horse opened in the morning, because the sentiment turned up in the afternoon of the previous day, and most discussions were bullish. The first market price was 1,237 yuan. As soon as this market opened, everyone rushed in together, rising directly to 1,244 yuan. Unexpectedly, large households still came to sell, and the table turned loose for a while, falling back to 1,241 yuan. This price hovered for a long time. It was then heard that the spot sales business was still not bad, and the bulls' intentions were very strong. Near 11 o'clock, the bulls shouted and allowed fiercely, rising to 1,250 yuan. Afterwards, profits were released, and it loosened by a few yuan. The closing price was 1,249 yuan. It is estimated that the half-day transaction statistics were 5,906 bales. The 20-count Double Horse rose by 10 yuan. The amount bought by each helping is as follows:

Peers 5,000 Hong Kong 900

Mainland 6 Statistics 5,906

### Cotton Merchants' Transactions Gradually Improving

The current cotton situation is trending towards improvement. Due to the rebound in the yarn market, factories like Xin'an, etc., are seeing transactions for 32-count single yarn raw materials. Japanese factories are also showing activity. As a result, trading houses are buying and selling from each other, further improving the situation. Confidence is stronger, but prices remain calm.

In other news, the foreign cotton market in New York is also becoming active. First, due to purchases by spot traders, and then due to increased demand from the industry, the closing price was four to five points higher than the previous day. The Indian market is closed, with forecasts predicting an increase of several rupees.

Yesterday, Shanghai's foreign cotton trading was relatively quiet due to the weekend. All parties temporarily suspended purchases, so trading will have to rely on next week.

### Piece Goods - White Goods and Dyed Fabrics Particularly Firm

Factory Cloth: The market trend remains firm, mainly because demand from the industry and dyeing factories remains strong, and sentiment is enthusiastic. Sales are firm. White goods like Fugui fine cloth, etc., continue to rise, each piece by 10 to 25 cents. Bleached and dyed cloths also rose by 25 to 50 cents per piece. This street traded over 1,000 pieces of flannel and grey cloth, over 300 pieces of Guangdong-style poplin, cotton drill, and coarse cloth, over 100 pieces of Zhejiang-style bleached cloth and colored twill, and over 100 pieces of Yantai-style flannel and heavy coarse cloth. For overseas locations like Singapore, over 3,000 bolts of bleached cloth and blue cloth were traded. Today, 2,710 pieces of piece goods arrived in Hong Kong, and 25 pieces were shipped to Yantai.

Eastern Cloth: White goods are experiencing strong demand due to continuous demand for dyed fabrics on this street, and the market sentiment is very firm. Sales are doing well.

### Oilseed Cakes - Oil Market Unlikely to Fall - Speculators Use Huge Sums of Money to Continuously Buy and Push Up Prices

The large batch of crude oil that a certain party dumped the previous day, over 2,400 barrels were traded, priced at $106. It is rumored that the total amount is 5,000 barrels, with the remainder still under negotiation. As a result, yesterday's soybean oil market has turned lower. Raw oil also opened slightly weak, but ultimately, because speculative elements refused to back down, using huge sums of money to continuously buy and push up prices, soybean oil fell slightly, while raw oil futures rose by $1 to over $1. A total of 3,000 barrels of Dalian soybean oil for December delivery were traded on the unified market, as well as 50 units of Dayou factory soybean oil, 30 units of Yanqi soybean oil, 200 units of Jiaozhou soybean oil, and 300 units of raw oil. Over 1,000 barrels of Qingdao raw beans were also traded for late December delivery, and nearly 1,000 barrels for February delivery.

### Cost of Living Allowances Should Adopt a "Sliding Scale System"

— Hao

Since the prices in Shanghai have risen in a straight line, the issue of allowances between labor and management has arisen immediately. Generally, employees find that their salaries are insufficient to maintain their family's livelihood, so they have asked the employer to increase allowances. The employer also believes that they cannot force employees to work on an empty stomach, and automatically or passively increase salary and allowances for employees. The allowance method and the size of the amount are mostly determined arbitrarily by the employer, without any reasonable basis. Some add a percentage to the original salary, and others give a fixed allowance of tens of dollars. Although employees can barely survive for a while with this, the anxiety about living has not disappeared. Because prices are constantly changing, increasing without decreasing, and allowances are fixed and limited, if the salary is increased by several dollars this month, the cost of living will increase sharply in the following months, then what is the point of increasing the amount? No wonder employees are always worried. As prices rise and the cost of living rises, employees will still be unable to support their lives, and they will inevitably ask for a salary increase again, in a cycle of back and forth, which is not a long-term solution. Looking at the labor unrest in various industries in the past, the reason is that the allowance methods adopted have failed to adapt to this situation. Although there has been some discussion in the past regarding public opinion, no specific and feasible compromise method has been found. This problem has been lingering in the author's mind for a long time, and recently the threat to life has become increasingly severe. Moreover, the allowance method adopted by the company where I work is as incomplete as others, so I feel like a bone is stuck in my throat, and I have to spit it out quickly. Therefore, I would like to take an impartial attitude and make some proposals on this issue, hoping to elicit valuable opinions.

Employees exchange labor for wages to maintain their family's livelihood. Now, due to high prices, that is, the result of the low purchasing power of money, the wages earned are not enough to maintain their lives, and the employer should give appropriate compensation to increase the amount of their salary, which is their due responsibility. However, what kind of standard should be used to increase

Cost of Living Allowances Should Adopt a "Sliding Scale System" – Hao

Since the prices in Shanghai have risen in a straight line, the issue of allowances between labor and management has arisen immediately. What kind of standard should be used to increase employee income? The author believes that a "sliding scale system" should be adopted, that is, a fixed "standard wage" and a fixed "allowance percentage" should be used, and the allowance should be increased or decreased monthly according to the multiple of the increase in the cost of living for workers published by the Engineering Department of the Public Works Department compared to the base period. In order to adapt to the changing situation of prices and relieve the anxiety of workers' lives, the details are as follows.

The cost of living index for workers published by the Engineering Department of the Public Works Department is a reliable measure of the expenses required to maintain a certain standard of living. It is divided into five items: food, rent, clothing, fuel, and miscellaneous items; however, these five expenses are all necessary to maintain life, so a total index is listed separately, which in November of this year was 540.62. (with 1936 as the base period). Moreover, since the recent expenses have been increasing day by day and the living standards of workers have declined, the cost of reducing the standard of living is said to have increased by 3.91 times. The current suggestion is to increase or decrease the allowance proportionally according to the multiple of this increase, which is the most reasonable and practical basis.

Considering that there is such a reasonable and practical standard, as far as the author knows, neither the upper nor lower levels have adopted it. However, we have often heard that the labor side raises the demand for salary increases based on the cost of living index, which is often rejected by the employer. Some employers even shake their heads and show disgust as soon as they hear the word "index," feeling that the cost of living index is too high and the employer has its own difficulties, and is often unable to make this same proportional salary increase, so they refuse to eat because of choking? In fact, it is a well-known fact that the assets and business conditions of various industries are different, and it is difficult to force them to make the same amount of allowances. However, as long as the method is slightly compromised and changed, any factory can adopt it. The so-called change is to increase or decrease a certain percentage of the allowance, and the effect of adapting to price changes is the same. For example, employers with abundant financial resources can afford to pay 100% of the allowance; if their financial resources are indeed insufficient, they can also reduce the percentage of the allowance, setting it at 70%, 40%, but the minimum cannot be less than 25%.

I also heard people say: "Big difficulties for big ones, small difficulties for small ones," meaning that at this time, it is difficult to maintain the life of those with small salaries: those with large salaries also have their difficulties. However, the author believes that at this time of hardship, those with large salaries (referring to those with monthly salaries of several hundred dollars) may as well slightly reduce their enjoyment of life to maintain it; while those with small salaries, the life they lead is originally "minimal," and in fact there is no way to reduce it, so the need to increase allowances is more urgent. Therefore, increasing according to the proportion of the original salary is obviously not in line with reality, and another standard wage should be set. The multiple of the increase in the cost of living for this standard wage, or the percentage of the allowance, is the cost-of-living allowance that each employee, regardless of the size of their original salary, should receive.

To give an example: In November, the cost of living increased by 3.91 times compared to this. Assuming that the standard wage is $50, and assuming that the percentage of the allowance is 0.25, the calculation formula is as follows:

(3.91×0.25)×＄50＝0.9775×＄50＝＄48.87 $48.87 is the allowance that employees should receive in November.

The above-mentioned standard wage is just an example estimate made by the author based on a family of five, without any solid basis, and should not be regarded as a fixed rule. It is hoped that the Engineering Department of the Public Works Department will formulate and publish this standard wage so that the authorities in various industries have something to base it on, and I think that department will also be happy to do so.

If the wise authorities of various industries can adopt this labor-saving system to subsidize employees, the employees can reduce their anxiety about life and concentrate on production and work; and the employers can also avoid the trouble of dealing with personnel disputes and unfortunate losses, wouldn't it be a win-win situation?

### After Increasing Staff Subsidies, Shanghai Municipal Council Expenditures Surge, Resulting in an Annual Shortfall of Ten Million, Requiring Either a Second Round of Borrowing or Increased Taxes

A spokesperson for the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) disclosed yesterday (the 7th) that, following the approval of increased cost-of-living allowances for employees, monthly expenditures will increase by seven to eight million yuan. This figure is a "rough estimate." Given that the SMC has already approved employee allowance increases twice this year, the 1940 budget is expected to be in deficit. The total amount of the shortfall cannot be disclosed at this time. The SMC is currently preparing a detailed financial report, which will be released soon. Until then, the exact amount of the deficit cannot be determined.

This Year's Budget Short by Ten Million

However, according to a financial expert here, considering the SMC's repeated increases in staff allowances this year, the 1940 budget will be short by at least ten million yuan. The SMC increased taxes by 15% on July 1st this year and borrowed 16 million yuan from HSBC, generating special revenue. It is estimated that the revenue reached a total of 32 million yuan, but it is expected that this amount has already been allocated to other necessary expenses.

Further Tax Increases Quite Possible

Therefore, the SMC may have to borrow money for a second time this year or convene a special meeting of taxpayers to increase taxes further. If the SMC takes such action, it is expected that taxes in the International Settlement will increase by another 13%. At the same time, employees of the SMC's police and other departments have expressed enthusiastic satisfaction with the SMC's approval of cost-of-living allowances. Some police officers stated that the authorities should have taken this action earlier, as employees might not have resigned in large numbers, and personnel in the police and fire departments would not have been at risk of work slowdowns.

Grade A Staff Cost-of-Living Allowances

The SMC's Information Office announced yesterday that, regarding the "Increase in Allowances for Chinese Constables and Staff" announcement issued by the SMC yesterday, the following should be added to the end: "Grade A staff receiving foreign exchange allowances will only receive cost-of-living allowances based on two-thirds of their basic salary, i.e., 150% of the first 500 yuan of two-thirds of their salary, and so on."

Chinese Constable Representatives Encourage People

The Chinese Constable Representatives Committee issued a letter to all colleagues to conclude the living requirements. It begins by stating that the occurrence of neglect of duty on our part is indeed due to the high pressure of life. We were elected by all to present our living requirements to the SMC. The SMC has understood and has given the "on the album" for Chinese constables and police officers (issued on December 6). We try to reflect on ourselves. The Representative Committee is seeking satisfaction on behalf of all our colleagues in life. Regarding the establishment of a mutual aid society, we thank the Chief of the Police Department of the SMC for his approval, and Mr. Yu Qiaqing is handling it, seeking permanent welfare for our colleagues. With the enthusiastic donations of our colleagues, the total amount of funds for the mutual aid society is 5,585 yuan, which has been sent to Mr. Yu Qiaqing for safekeeping. Furthermore, Mr. Yu Qiaqing will raise another 50,000 yuan to establish the mutual aid society fund. In short, the rational demands of all our colleagues have been rationally resolved. We should still adhere to our original intention of serving the SMC and the citizens, and with the spirit of taking care of the overall situation, we must serve with faith and loyalty to ensure local security, strictly prevent incitement, and not be shaken by rumors and act rashly, so as to affect the overall situation and plunge the locality into a state of unrest. Moreover, this kind of excessive behavior is not allowed by law and is contrary to our due duty. It is expected that all my colleagues can deeply understand the righteousness, not change this intention, and not violate this purpose. It can be expected that the merits and demerits of this association will be set aside, and to all my colleagues, we should pay tribute to incense and flowers and bless Mr. Yu Qiaqing, the leader of the citizens. We should also repay the millions of citizens with the spirit of loyal service, because the assistance and sympathy given to us are too enthusiastic and great, and the SMC's understanding of our urgency is even more worthy of our gratitude. From now on, we must never fail these sympathies and lose the valuable rear support that we have already obtained. Therefore, this association has completed the task of demanding life and will end here. For the final announcement of this association, all my colleagues should accept, be safe and self-sufficient, and abide by laws and police regulations, otherwise it will be illegal. I hope my colleagues will learn from this. Sincerely, Shanghai British Concession SMC Police Department Chinese Constable Representatives Committee, December 7, 1940.

Two Representatives for Each Police Station

The list of representatives of the Chinese Constable Representatives Committee is as follows: (1) Old Line: No. 5 Liu Ting, No. 2112 Zhang Huiwen; (2) Old Gate: No. 2086 Gan Jiaen, No. 2532 Zhu Haian; (3) New Gate: No. 1776 Zhang Changwei, No. 73 Han Shuqing; (4) Chengdu Road: No. 1130 Tang Chuntao, No. 520 Li Zengpei; (5) West Hongkou: No. 3263 Tian Shijie, No. 3395 Zhu Lixian; (6) Jing'an Temple: No. 173 Li Yuanxiang, No. 2900 Tang Chongshan; (7) Gordon Road: No. 3343 Wang Chunsheng, No. 2995 Wu Shuzi; (8) Putuo Road: No. 977 Chen Qishan, No. 1656 Wang Yongchang; (9) Reserve Team: No. 2682 Li Rusong, No. 1927 Liu Yukun; (10) Prison: No. 158 Chen Xinxian, No. 2122 Gu Dexiong; (11) Hongkou: No. 2827 Liu Panquan, No. 2807 Liu Jiyun.

Mutual Aid Society to Be Organized Immediately

After the Chinese Constable Committee announced its dissolution, the Chinese Constable Mutual Aid Society will be organized immediately. Yesterday afternoon, eight representatives of the Chinese constables paid a special visit to Mr. Yu Qiaqing and Mr. Yao Zengmo, the Deputy Chief of the Chinese Police Department, to express their gratitude and to ask them to be responsible for sponsoring the establishment of the mutual aid society. The two expressed their approval. The Chinese constable representatives then handed over a portion of the funds raised by the Chinese constables, more than 5,500 yuan, to Mr. Yu. Mr. Yu had previously agreed to raise 50,000 yuan to sponsor this matter, and yesterday he agreed to raise an additional 50,000 yuan from the business community, totaling 100,000 yuan, to serve as the mutual aid society fund. After the funds are raised, they will be deposited in the bank together to be used for various mutually beneficial undertakings for the Chinese constables in the future. All association affairs are actively underway.

### The Charity Relief Association Sends Letters to All Sectors to Solicit Donations

The joint charity relief association holds a winter relief campaign every year to benefit the poor. This year, rice prices have soared, and life has become more difficult. The association has learned that the main relief work, such as providing rice, clothing, and steamed buns, as well as setting up shelters for the poor, will continue as usual. However, with everyone's support, the association hopes to receive enthusiastic donations from all sectors to achieve complete success. The association issued two circulars yesterday, calling on all sectors to provide assistance. The following is a separate record:

Call for Payment of Subscription Donations

Respectfully, our association held a reception for all sectors at the Gongdelin on November 22 to raise funds for winter relief. We are grateful for your presence, and donations reached 46,000 yuan on the spot. Other relief items were also numerous. We have rented two mu of land at Yan's residence on Difeng Road from the SMC to set up shelters, and we are building sheds and making bedding for regular shelter. However, this year's prices are extremely high.

### The French Police Department Considers Increasing Allowances for Chinese Constables

In view of the high cost of living in Shanghai, the French Concession police authorities, and the Chinese constables of the Public Concession police have been specially decided by the SMC Board of Directors to improve the treatment of Chinese constables as much as possible. The French Concession cannot lag behind. Therefore, the French Police Department has suggested to the French Municipal Council to increase the allowances for its Chinese constables so that they can maintain their lives and serve with peace of mind. It is understood that the French authorities are currently considering the detailed measures for the allowance, which will be announced soon. Rice, clothing, steamed buns, and relief for the poor are all included. The total amount required is more than 300,000 yuan. The shortfall of the aforementioned recognized donations is extremely large, and we should continue to appeal. We are enclosing a donation appeal and respectfully request that you donate the money you pledged as soon as possible to help with the progress. If you can help raise more money, that would be greatly appreciated.

Continue to Appeal

Respectfully, our association organizes winter relief every year to help the general poor, including providing rice, clothing, steamed buns, and relief for the hidden poor, as well as temporary shelters to accommodate the homeless and foodless poor. We have also helped to break the habit of smoking addiction. Over the years, we have received social recognition. This year, rice prices have soared, and everything is expensive, making the lives of the poor even more difficult. Beggars have no way to make a living, and starvation is rampant. Newspaper reports have recorded more than a thousand shocking cases that bring tears to the eyes. Our association has been urged by all parties to continue to carry out all winter relief matters as before. However, since this year's prices are extremely high, a large amount of money is needed, and our association's finances are extremely tight. We have no choice but to appeal widely in the hope that everyone will work together. We have always admired your compassion and care for others. We are sending you a letter asking you to donate and raise funds so that we can gather strength and complete this meritorious deed.

### Coal Briquettes Rise in Price Again Yesterday

Yesterday, the coal briquette market was quite unstable. As a result, the coal briquette factory's price rose from 152 yuan to 160 yuan per ton, an increase of 8 yuan per ton. The retail price rose from 8.2 yuan to 8.6 yuan per dan (100 jin), an increase of 4 jiao per dan. This was clearly caused by unscrupulous people spreading unfounded rumors.

### Rice Market Repeatedly Exceeds Price Limits, Exceeding Legal Profits. Authorities to Convene Meeting Tomorrow to Discuss Stabilization Measures. Hong Kong Has Not Banned the Export of Tribute Rice.

The Shanghai Rice Industry Association previously issued an emergency notice on the 4th of this month due to the soaring rice prices, which had a great impact on the people's food supply, limiting rice prices to no more than the prices on the 3rd of this month. However, recently rice prices have risen again, not only exceeding the above price limit, but also exceeding the profits that should be obtained, which is not appropriate. In view of this, the authorities of the two settlements have been actively trying to suppress rice prices, and have scheduled a meeting for 2 p.m. next Monday (the 9th of this month) to convene rice industry leaders to discuss ways to stabilize the rice market and maintain the people's food supply. It is understood that the exchange rate has improved recently, and the cost of ordering foreign rice has been reduced, so rice prices in this city should gradually fall.

Letter to French Consulate to Release Specified Rice

The Shanghai Bean, Rice, Miscellaneous Grain, Oil Cake Industry, and Rice Grain Evaluation Committee, a group of three rice industries, jointly sent a letter to Mr. Majeri, the French Consul General in Shanghai, yesterday, stating that our association entrusted various foreign firms to order a total of 8,500 tons of No. 1 rice from Saigon in October and November of this year, specifying that they would be loaded onto ships in December of this year and sent to Shanghai to supply the people with food. According to reports from various foreign firms, the government of that place has banned the export of No. 1 rice, but No. 2 rice can still be shipped. Therefore, the above-mentioned 8,500 tons of orders have all been blocked. At a time when Shanghai is short of food and rice prices are high, the impact is extremely serious. In addition to the fact that various foreign firms have telegraphed for release, we take the liberty of sending a letter requesting that the Consul consider the extraordinary needs of the people of this city and quickly telegraph the Vietnamese government to allow the release of the order immediately. Now that new rice is being launched in Vietnam, if it cannot be helped, please delay it for a month and change to new goods, or it is also possible to replace No. 1 rice with No. 2 rice that is allowed to be exported. We sincerely hope that you will grant our request.

All Parties Voluntarily Donate Food to the People

Yu Qiaqing suggested advancing funds to purchase 200,000 bags of Saigon rice as a base. As needed, sell some and buy some more in an endless cycle to prevent panic and stabilize the market. The regulations for establishing a public warehouse stipulate the amount of grain that each group should purchase and store. According to news from the banking industry, the Banking Association and the Money Industry Association believe that establishing a warehouse to store grain is a matter of urgency. In addition to agreeing with Yu's suggestion, they have resolutely decided to generously store 50,000 bags of grain. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday issued a notice to various industry associations to assist in the continued relief efforts for cheap rice. Dafoe Foreign Firm is currently entrusting the Price Evaluation Committee to distribute 93 bags of broken rice and 49 bags of corn to support charitable causes. The French Municipal Council prepared a car on the 6th (Friday) to distribute this rice to six charitable organizations, including the Salvation Army. The distribution was supervised by two members of the French Concession Volunteer Corps, Schibaike and Plame. We hope that all parties will follow suit and increase assistance to benefit the disaster victims.

How Are the Advantages and Disadvantages of Collective Grain Storage?

The previous report mentioned that advocating grain storage may affect the value of Vietnamese rice. According to Mr. Yu Zhiqin, Vietnam and Myanmar are world food markets. As far as the needs of Shanghai are concerned, the amount of transactions in this market is secondary and will not lead to an increase in prices due to orders from Shanghai. Yu also said that experts set up a group to purchase rice, fearing that it would promote group accumulation, and also advocated that group purchase of rice should avoid conflicts with merchants. The important purpose of group purchase of rice is for group orders, prepared for the use of large companies, factories, and schools, not for sale. After this measure is implemented, the city's reserves can be used for the common people, and rice prices will naturally be suppressed. Since the group purchase of rice is to avoid the actions of merchants stockpiling and manipulating, so as to stabilize the rice market, how can we avoid conflicts with merchants in the entire business? These two points are worth studying.

### Mr. Woodhead Encourages the British Air Force. Patriotic Activities Must Be a Collective Effort

Mr. Woodhead, the Far East editor of the local English-language "China Press," recently attended a dinner hosted by the British Royal Air Force Association at its headquarters on the HSBC Building, at the invitation of the association. During the dinner, members of the association, knowing Woodhead's unique views on the current situation, asked him to give a speech. Woodhead, who is also British, first expressed his admiration for the skills of the Royal Air Force personnel, and then said that there are still many people in the United Kingdom who are not concerned about the future of their motherland, which is clearly evident in Shanghai. Woodhead therefore urged democrats among the British community to rise up quickly and change this unfavorable situation, and to make a collective effort for all patriotic organizations and activities in Shanghai. All the members were deeply moved and vowed to fight to the end for the survival and safety of their motherland.

### British St. Andrew's Society Hosts Dinner for British Rear Admiral

The local British St. Andrew's Society held a dinner at the Shanghai General Association the other day. Rear Admiral Glassford, commander of the US Yangtze River Fleet, and Colonel Baker, commander of the Fourth Regiment, were among the guests. The president of the association, Gelliland, gave a welcome speech. During the dinner, the guests talked and laughed, and the atmosphere was warm. Finally, Rear Admiral Glassford gave a reply, in which he expressed his gratitude for the warm hospitality of the association and said that the US Navy would do its best to help the United Kingdom. Since Rear Admiral Hurd, commander of the Asian Fleet, left Shanghai, Glassford's position has become very important. In addition to maintaining close contact with Rear Admiral Hurd, who is currently stationed in the Philippines, through telecommunications, he has full power to handle US naval affairs in Shanghai. His flagship is the "Luzon."

### Overseas Chinese From Shanghai and Hong Kong to Vietnam Must Have Passports, Visaed by French Consul in Hong Kong, or Landing Documents from Hong Kong Government

The Vietnamese authorities recently promulgated new regulations restricting the entry of Chinese overseas citizens. The Chinese Consulate in Saigon specially announced that, in order to adapt to the current situation, the Governor of Cochinchina opened a letter stating that, "In order to adapt to the current situation, the Governor-General of Indochina issued a notice that 'all overseas Chinese coming to Vietnam from Shanghai, Hong Kong, etc., if they are immigrants, must hold a passport of the Republic of China visaed by the French Consul in Hong Kong, or they must hold a document issued by the Hong Kong government authorizing them to land in Hong Kong.' Please take note of the relevant letter." Accordingly, overseas Chinese who are going to Vietnam are requested to pay attention.

### Crime Log

At 9:45 p.m. last night, two bandits armed with guns robbed a passerby on Ningbo Road, Zhili Road, stealing clothes and 1,100 yuan in national currency.

### Difficulties Still Exist in Entering and Exiting the Shanghai West Blockade Line. Searches of Chinese Residences Continued Yesterday. Japanese Commercial Buses Are Still Running.

According to foreign sources yesterday, Japanese military police continued to search Chinese residences within the blockade zone along Yidingpan Road yesterday, in an attempt to discover "nests of terrorists." The Japanese authorities have not yet released information on the results of the searches and the arrests made over the past six days. At the same time, there has been no official indication as to when the blockade and other restrictions imposed by the Japanese authorities in the western district of Shanghai will be lifted. Some quarters in the city expect that the blockade may be completely lifted at the beginning of next week, but this speculation cannot be confirmed. The Japanese authorities have now allowed food and other daily necessities to be sent to Chinese and foreign residents in the blockade zone, but all packages brought into the blockade zone must be strictly inspected.

Japanese Vehicles Run, Infringing Rights

Japanese commercial buses continued to run yesterday, charging 2 jiao, from the Paramount Hotel to Zhaofeng Park, after infringing on the patent rights of British commercial buses and tram companies earlier this week. The two companies seem to be waiting for the SMC to take action. According to a spokesperson for the SMC, after studying the protests of the British commercial bus company and tram company, the SMC may formally bring the matter to the attention of the Japanese authorities here. The spokesperson told the press that the Japanese commercial buses are operating on routes under the patented privileges of the Public Concession commercial bus company and tram company. This action directly violates the rights of the SMC, as this action must be approved by the SMC in advance. According to Mr. Lin, the acting spokesperson of the Japanese Embassy here, the operation of Japanese commercial buses in western Shanghai is only a temporary measure to meet the needs of the majority of people in the area.

Route Charts Posted Publicly

Yesterday marked the end of the first week of the Japanese blockade of western Shanghai. Regarding the situation in and around the blockade zone, a reporter from the Dazhong News Agency visited the area again yesterday. At the Jing'an Temple Road intersection and near the Paramount Hotel, the so-called "Shanghai West Citizens' Commercial Bus Company" not only set up ticket offices with tables and chairs, but also posted a route map of the "Commercial Bus" on the wire mesh frame. The routes are: "Route 1" from the Jing'an Temple Road intersection to Dunxin Road Columbia Road; "Route 2" from the Paramount Hotel directly to Zhaofeng Garden. Except for Yidingpan Road, where passengers can get on and off, there are no stops at other places. Only those who take a "bus" can buy tickets to enter at the Jing'an Temple Road intersection and the Paramount Hotel. Chinese and Western students can enter and exit freely, but others are still prohibited from passing through. There are the most people entering and exiting Qianjia Lane because the wire mesh has been removed there, and the inspection is relatively relaxed, so it has become the only channel for the settlement to enter the blockade zone.

Many Restrictions Still on Residents' Entry and Exit

The three places where citizens are allowed to enter and exit can now carry food in and out, so the panic about food and fuel in the area has been somewhat reduced. However, the alleyways in the Home Street and east of Yidingpan Road are still heavily blockaded and searched from time to time, as the Japanese are determined to eradicate the "terrorists." The current situation of each blockade line is as follows: (1) Jing'an Temple Road intersection; (2) Paramount Hotel (the starting point of the "commercial bus," only those who take the "bus" can enter, and all others are prohibited from entering and exiting); (3) Intersection of Jisi Fei'er Road and Difeng Road (except for teachers and students, passage is prohibited); (4) Intersection of Daxilu and Difeng Road (this place is exclusively for foreigners to enter and exit); (5) Intersection of Daxilu and Jing'an Temple Road (this place is completely blockaded); (6) Intersection of Yuyuan Road and Yidingpan Road; (7) Intersection of Daxilu and Yidingpan Road; (8) Intersection of Yuyuan Road and Qianjia Lane (the above three places are so-called open places, and citizens and those who take silver cars and self-provided cars can enter and exit); (9) The north and south ends of Yidingpan Road (the ends are completely blockaded, and the north end can enter and exit).

### Portuguese Ship Transports Huge Amount of Silk Cocoons to Shanghai, Japanese Obstruct Unloading, 1,000 Bales Unloaded Worth 250,000 Yuan, Rumor Says Japanese Navy Was a "Misunderstanding," Goods on German and Italian Ships Are Also Often Hindered by Japanese

The "North China Daily News" reported that the Portuguese ship "Santa Anna" was unloading 1,000 bales of silk cocoons worth 250,000 yuan on the Bund outside the French Concession yesterday (the 6th), when it was suddenly interfered with and detained by the Japanese naval authorities, preventing it from leaving Shanghai as scheduled yesterday afternoon. The reason was that the "Santa Anna" was carrying silk cocoons and other goods from the mouth of the Yangtze River for Chinese merchants and arrived in Shanghai shortly after midnight on the 5th, berthing in front of the floating pier on the Bund of the French Concession.

Half an Hour Later

When the unloading of silk cocoons began, eight Japanese sailors and a petty officer arrived in a motorboat, boarded the "Santa Anna," and prevented the unloading of silk cocoons. The comprador of the ship had preliminary consultations with the Japanese soldiers on board, but there were no obvious results. The Japanese side obstructed the unloading of the goods, and the reason was unknown. Later, the cargo owner, the shipowner, and the Japanese naval authorities repeatedly discussed the matter for a long time, and the Portuguese Consulate was also informed. It was not until the afternoon that the goods were allowed to be unloaded. According to reports, the "Santa Anna" is the third Portuguese ship in recent months to have its unloading obstructed by the Japanese naval authorities. The first was the "Santarem," which recently carried cotton from the mouth of the Yangtze River to Shanghai and was also obstructed when unloading in front of the floating pier on the Bund of the French Concession. The second was the "Ave Maria," which also encountered the same difficulties and was released after several days. The "Santa Anna" has been sailing along the Chinese coast and originally sailed between Wenzhou and Shanghai. A few months ago, the Japanese tightened restrictions on coastal shipping and changed to sailing downstream of the Yangtze River, which was obviously not a small port subject to the ban on navigation. Before leaving Shanghai, it also obtained a bill of lading from customs. Furthermore, foreign ships carrying goods from coastal ports adjacent to Yi to Shanghai have been detained by the Japanese on several occasions. For example, two German ships and one Italian ship were seized by the Japanese after arriving in Shanghai, and the shipowners paid huge "fines" before they were released. Also, the English "China Press" reported that, according to port authorities, the Japanese Navy detained the Portuguese ship "Santa Anna" due to a "misunderstanding."

### The Entire Shanghai Silk Industry on the Brink of Collapse; "Construction Donation" Unbearable; Silk Industry Peers Plan to Cope

Since the cocoon production areas of various counties in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces were controlled by the Japanese, the Chinese silk factories in this city have gradually felt the lack of supply. However, in the beginning, a small number could still be transported to Shanghai indirectly, and the shortage could be made up with existing inventory. As the control became more and more severe, the source was interrupted, and the decision to shut down gradually became clear. According to a survey, the number of silk factories in this city purely operated with Chinese capital used to be more than sixty, but by the end of last year, only more than twenty could start work. This spring, it was reduced to just over ten. By summer, only six remained. Now, even these last six are reportedly ceasing operations. What was once relied upon as a major export is now entirely forced to shut down.

Rampant Exactions

At this time of the entire silk industry's decline, a certain party has set up "Regulations for Collecting Donations on Cocoon Silk and Raw Silk," starting from December 1 of this period (autumn season), classifying and reporting donations according to rates. The tax donation used to be 110 yuan per picul of raw silk, but now an additional "Special Construction Donation" of 370 yuan is required. Therefore, the current price per picul of raw silk, in terms of tax donation alone, requires 480 yuan. According to an inquiry by a reporter from Da Zhong News Agency, since the implementation of these regulations on the first of this month, very few silk merchants have gone to that place to "report donations." Consequently, they joined forces with the "Unified Tax Bureau" the other day and dispatched a large number of personnel, estimated to be over 300, to patrol around this city. If any raw silk is found that has not been "reported for donation," it will be immediately seized and forced to pay taxes according to regulations.

Convening a Meeting

Therefore, disputes have arisen frequently in recent days. The raw silk industry peers, unable to bear the harassment, plan to convene a meeting in the coming days to discuss countermeasures. The silk shops wholesale places in this city believe that since the source of raw silk has been subjected to rampant exactions, the cost of manufacturing silk fabrics will inevitably increase compared to before. To maintain the balance between capital and price and avoid losses, the only option is to increase the selling price to supplement the costs. However, since the prices of various goods in this city have soared drastically, the purchasing power of citizens is no longer as strong as before. Moreover, the largest customers of silk fabrics mostly belong to the property-owning class, and they are not essential items for ordinary people, unlike other goods that are more common. If prices are increased rashly, the merchants will inevitably wait and see, which will have a great impact on business. Therefore, they are particularly hesitant about this issue and may need to convene a meeting to reach a consensus.

### Bombing of a Train on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway; Japanese Report; Admits to Arresting Villagers

The Zi Lin Bao reported that Navy Spokesman, Colonel Saito, claimed yesterday (the 6th) at a press conference with reporters that the Chinese guerrillas recently took advantage of the rainy weather to bury electrified landmines under the Nanjing Railway tracks near Suzhou. On the 29th of the previous month, an explosion destroyed five train cars. Nearby villagers were arrested within the past few days for assisting the guerrillas. After the incident, seventy-two to seventy-three people died and one hundred and twenty-eight were injured. They were sent to Suzhou hospitals for treatment, with only one military injury resulting in death.

### New York Donations Fall Short; Plight of Jewish People; Only One Meal Per Person; Fundraising to be Held in This City

The financial plight of the Jewish refugee relief organizations in this city is about to suffer a new blow. According to what was heard yesterday, their hopes for remittances from New York to Shanghai have vanished. According to people in the Jewish refugee relief organizations, there are about 14,000 Jewish refugees from Germany and Austria in this city. They used to have three free meals a day in the shelters. However, due to economic difficulties, it has been reduced to one meal a day. Now that no donations are being remitted from New York, these Jewish refugees will inevitably be more affected. It is said that the New York United Jewish Appeal is the organization that supports Jewish refugee relief organizations around the world. The Jewish refugee shelters and hospitals in the Hongkew District of this city almost entirely rely on donations from New York to survive. Now that no funds are being remitted, it must be because there is not enough to go around and it cannot be distributed. We can only step up fundraising in this city and save expenses at the same time to ensure that the refugees do not starve to death. Jews with financial means in this city should also provide as much relief as possible to supplement the funds. As far as is currently known, there are fewer than fifteen Jews in this city who regularly donate large sums of money.

### Japanese Planes and Warships Bomb Chuanshan Fiercely; Attempt to Land; Forty-Two Bombs Dropped; More Than Forty Shells Fired

According to reliable sources in the shipping industry, at 9:00 AM on the 6th, five Japanese planes were spotted in Chuanshan, flying from the northwest to the southwest. Later, three more Japanese planes were spotted circling in the southwest sky. They dropped twenty-one bombs in a certain area, destroying more than forty houses, killing seven civilians, and injuring four. The batch of Japanese planes fled to the northwest. When passing through Chaiqiao, they blindly dropped six more bombs, destroying thirty-eight houses, killing two people, and injuring two. They then turned back and dropped nine bombs near Yangshan, destroying six houses and killing five people. Subsequently, they dropped two bombs in Xiaopu Zhang, collapsing three houses. Four bombs were also dropped aimlessly in Daqi Tou, destroying one house and injuring one person. The planes passed Zhenhai and went north. Also, at noon yesterday, a Japanese warship sailed from the southeast of Chuanshan and fired more than forty shells at the shore. It also launched speedboats in an attempt to land.

### Delayed Delivery of Ordered Steel Plates; Metal Company Sues for Compensation; Each Side Holds Its Own View, Court Orders Rescheduling for Further Review

Qi Shengquan, the owner of Yong Sheng Metal Company at No. 239 Jiangxi Road, who is from Ningbo, ordered 200 tons of half-inch thick, four-foot wide, and eight-foot long steel plates from the Belgian firm Huadelong Foreign Company on December 2, 1936, at a price of £10 5s per ton. On February 5, 1937, he reordered 20 tons of the same steel plates. After both parties signed the contract, Huadelong Foreign Company only delivered 135.5 tons, with 84.5 tons still remaining.

Delayed Delivery

Yong Sheng Metal Company believes that because the price of steel plates has soared in recent years, Huadelong Foreign Company sold the incoming orders to a third party at a good price, considering it a breach of contract. Recently, he entrusted lawyers Ge Bangqian and Zhang Lishi to file a lawsuit with the Civil Court of the First Special District Court, requesting the court to order the defendants, Luo Minghua, the Western manager of Huadelong Foreign Company, Tong Kuixuan, the manager, and Zhong Linshu, the salesman, to deliver the goods, or to order the defendants to jointly and severally compensate for the losses, totaling £797 7s 6d in silver. The court accepted the case and summoned the defendants through the Civil Court No. 3 presided over by Judge Ni.

Manager Luo Ming

Because he enjoyed consular jurisdiction, refused to appear in court. The third defendant, Zhong Linshu, also did not appear because he lived in the French Concession. At that time, only the second defendant, Tong Kuixuan, appeared in court through a lawyer. First, the lawyer representing Qi Shengquan, the owner of Yong Sheng Metal Company, stated the intent of the lawsuit, saying that although the contract for purchasing steel plates was signed by the foreign manager Luo Ming, the negotiation and pricing were all done by the second defendant, Tong Kuixuan, and the third defendant Zhong Linshu was also present. After the contract was established, the defendant only delivered 135.5 tons of steel plates, with 84.5 tons still undelivered. It was not that the defendant did not have the goods, but because the price of metals soared after August 13.

Prices Soared

The defendants sold the goods originally ordered by the plaintiff to others at a high price. When the contract was originally signed, the price of steel was £10 5s per ton, but now the market price has risen to £20 1s per ton. The defendant's breach of contract earned them a great profit, and the plaintiff suffered significant losses. Therefore, he requested the court to order the defendants to deliver the goods or compensate the plaintiff for the losses of £797 7s 6d. Next, the lawyer representing the defendant Tong Kuixuan argued that the defendant was the compradore of Huadelong Foreign Company, and according to the law, the defendant should not be responsible for fulfilling the contract, because the power of the foreign company was entirely in the hands of foreigners, and the contract was also signed by the taipan Luo Ming, which had nothing to do with the defendant. After reviewing the arguments, the court ordered the case to be rescheduled for further hearing on December 14.

### Huge Amount of Gold Bars Seized on the New Beijing Ship; Totaling 40 Bars Valued at Over 2 Million; Customs Seizes and Confiscates, Criminal Flees

The Jianghai Customs officers seized a large batch of gold bars on the British-owned Taikoo Company's New Beijing ship the other day, with an estimated value of around 2.6 million yuan. The details of the case are recorded below. The Jianghai Customs received a tip-off in advance, stating that a large batch of gold bars was being smuggled into Shanghai on the ship, and the location where the gold bars were hidden was also revealed. The customs dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western seizure officers to the ship on the other day when the ship arrived in Shanghai from Tianjin and docked at the Bund Wharf in the French Concession. They went directly into the engine room, intending to carry out the search. At that time, they were blocked by the Westerner managing the engine room. After the seizure officers negotiated with him, they dismantled the iron pipes in the room, and they shockingly discovered the gold bars hidden inside. After counting them one by one, there were a total of 40 bars, each weighing 10 taels, for a total weight of 400 taels, with an estimated value of around 2.61 million yuan. The seizure officers took all the smuggled gold bars to the Jianghai Customs for confiscation. However, when the officers seized the evidence of the gold bars, all the criminals related to the smuggling case took the opportunity to flee without a trace. It is now heard that the Tax Police Bureau is still investigating the main perpetrators of the smuggling.

### Streetcar Ticket Seller Cheats, Assaults Passenger; Meng Mingqin Has Reported to the Police Station, Requesting Investigation

Hua Guang News Agency reported that at around 12:45 PM the other day (the 6th), a French streetcar company's route one streetcar was traveling from west to east, when it arrived at the stop at the intersection of Avenue Albert, a passenger from Yangzhou, Meng Mingqin, who was over fifty years old, boarded the car at that location, intending to go to Hualong Road. He presented a one-dime coin, requesting a six-cent ticket. Unexpectedly, the ticket seller No. 28 on the car shortchanged him one cent. When Meng questioned him, the ticket seller became enraged out of embarrassment, replying that even if he cheated, it "doesn't matter," and began to curse and insult him. As a result, a conflict broke out between the two parties. The ticket seller then resorted to force, assaulting Meng in the face and other parts. At that time, all the passengers in the car stood up for Meng. Meng immediately got off the car, intending to drag the ticket seller into the police station, but he knew he was in the wrong and rang the bell, driving away quickly. Meng had no choice but to ask a passenger who was on the same car to accompany him to the Lou Ka Wan Police Station to report the incident, and went to the hospital to verify the injuries, requesting the police to investigate strictly according to the law.

### Impediments to Japan's Southern Advance

Regarding Japan's southern advance policy and its impediments, this publication now translates and records reports from two major American newspapers, as follows:

(I)

Through the vigorous wooing of Germany and Italy, Japan has already signed an economic alliance treaty with them. We can well believe that if China were not holding Japan in check, Japan might have already joined the war.

Apart from Vietnam, the abundant resources of Burma and the Dutch East Indies are worth coveting. Germany and Japan once had a secret agreement that, when the time was right, the Dutch East Indies would be divided equally between the two countries, with Germany taking Sumatra, Singapore, and the Federated Malay States, and Japan taking Java, Dutch Borneo, and nearby islands. Since Germany's successful invasion of the Netherlands, Germany believes that the time has come.

However, Japan is currently in a predicament and therefore has a different view. China's resistance has not yet been broken. The Japanese army still has 1.5 million men mired in the quagmire of the Asian continent. After three years of arduous fighting, Japan's economy and finances have been greatly weakened.

The Japanese fleet is said to be the third largest in the world, with nine battleships. Although they are all over twenty years old, they can be deployed at any time due to repeated overhauls and improvements. In addition, there are five aircraft carriers, twelve new heavy cruisers, twenty-seven light cruisers, one hundred and twelve destroyers, and sixty submarines.

Britain is unable to strengthen its Far East fleet under the current circumstances. Therefore, if the United States is not fully prepared and unable to use force to counter any attempt to change the status quo of the Dutch East Indies, then in theory, Japan's naval power in the Western Pacific can be said to be unparalleled.

Again, theoretically speaking, Japan is quite capable of posing a serious threat to Australia and New Zealand. But in practice, Japan's position also has many shortcomings. First, Japan lacks naval bases outside the three islands of Fusang (Japan) to repair large warships. In fact, outside of Japan, the only first-class naval base in the Far East is British Singapore, which is three thousand miles away from Japan.

Singapore is well-defended and heavily guarded, and has become a strong fortress. But to conquer the Dutch East Indies or Australia, Singapore must be captured first. To achieve this goal, Japan must travel far across the Eastern Ocean and deploy most of its main fleet. If the United States intervenes at this time and attacks Japan from the rear, the Japanese army stuck in the quagmire of China will be in danger of having its sea transport cut off and will be trapped in a dead end. If we take a step back, if Japan does not avoid danger and is determined to fight, its most reasonable move would be to attack Sumatra and use it as a base to besiege Singapore.

However, the Dutch defense in the area should not be underestimated. Before the outbreak of the European war last year, the reporter made an on-site inspection and was deeply impressed by the air force strength and naval and land defenses there.

Another point is that if Japan first takes Sumatra, it would be tantamount to thwarting Germany's ambitions. Some say that Japan will first gain military control of French Vietnam and Thailand, and then move south to attack Singapore. Recent Japanese actions in Vietnam show that this strategy may be adopted. However, transportation in Vietnam is difficult and the climate is harsh. If it is to be controlled, it will inevitably take a long time and cost a lot.

Another target for seizure is, of course, wealthy Hong Kong. But Hong Kong has also become a strong fortress and will put up a strong resistance. Moreover, the Chinese army in the hinterland of China is growing in number. Once the Japanese army besieges Hong Kong, they will rise up and counterattack. Moreover, even if Hong Kong falls, it will not determine the final victory or defeat.

Japan may bypass the Singapore forts and the Strait of Malacca controlled by the British Navy, and send cruisers and submarines to enter the Indian Ocean through the Timor Sea to disrupt British maritime trade. Japan may even risk sending naval forces to establish bases in the ports of Italian East Africa to participate in the all-out war. However, these ports are neither good harbors nor have they already been bombed to smithereens. Moreover, Japan's air force is beyond its reach, and the fleet will be greatly troubled by British air raids on its long voyage. It would be too rash for Japan to send a powerful fleet far into the Red Sea. If only a small naval contingent is sent, the large British fleet stationed in the Eastern Mediterranean can draw a part of it across the Suez Canal to deal with the Japanese Navy.

In addition, Japan has only one plan left for a large-scale attack on Australia or New Zealand. Over the past two years, the plan to strengthen defenses in Australia and New Zealand has progressed rapidly. Australia has a huge army and air force to defend its homeland. The northern provinces of Australia are sparsely populated, and it would be ineffective for the Japanese army to land there. To truly threaten Australia, a large expeditionary force must land in the south, where industry and wealth are concentrated.

The total tonnage of Japanese merchant ships is only around five million tons. Import and export trade is the lifeblood of the Japanese economy. The army in North, Central, and South China must also be constantly supplied. It is already stretched to the limit to maintain military supplies with the entire merchant fleet.

The distance from the Japanese mainland to Australia or New Zealand is more than four thousand miles. Japan cannot increase the tonnage of merchant ships to transport fifteen divisions, carrying tanks, artillery, transport vehicles, and aircraft between the two.

So, judging the situation objectively, Japan's entry into the war can only have a holding effect. British commerce in the Indian and Western Pacific Oceans will undoubtedly be disrupted. But at the same time, Japan's own indispensable trade with the Dutch East Indies, Australia, India, and other places will also be completely lost.

The United States has now banned the shipment of aircraft gasoline and scrap iron to Japan. China's iron ore production is small and of poor quality. Japan can only obtain kerosene from the Dutch East Indies, and iron only from Australia and India. Also crucial is the supply of Australian wool, which will also be cut off. About half of Japan's overseas trade relies on the transportation of neutral countries, which will also be lost entirely.

Britain's lease of the Atlantic and Caribbean islands to the United States as defense bases is of great significance in the eyes of the Japanese. If the U.S. Navy can freely use the ports of Bermuda and Jamaica, it can naturally also use Singapore's first-class naval docks and arsenals and the well-equipped Australian Sydney naval port when necessary. The significance of this will be even greater. (Translated from a special dispatch by the New York Herald Tribune)

(II)

After the "upper-level revolution" of the Konoe Cabinet, Japan has smoothly transformed into a highly centralized state. The implementation of the total mobilization of national resources is, of course, influenced by the fruitless three-year war against China, but it is also an inevitable trend after adopting a new diplomatic policy.

Japan's current position is unexpected. To understand the truth, one must look back at the situation three months ago. The Japanese military had decided on two policies: the Tripartite Alliance and totalitarian politics. In July of this year, the Japanese military submitted a note to the government, advocating that it should strengthen its ties with the Axis powers externally and strengthen the national structure internally. The Yonai Cabinet fell because it rejected this proposal. If we analyze it to the end, Japan's new internal structure and external lineup are both because it was found that a fundamental reform must be adopted to end the war against China and pull itself out of the quagmire. Therefore, Japan's first goal is still to end the war against China.

This sudden turn of events in Japan was also influenced by the dramatic changes in Europe this summer. After the Netherlands and France were conquered, Japan's ambitions also expanded automatically. "Greater East Asia-ism" has replaced the "Japan-Manchukuo-China Bloc," which had been loudly advocated for a long time. In just three months, Japan has abandoned the political and economic system it had adhered to for fifty years.

Japan's military strength cannot be underestimated. Its navy, in terms of tonnage and firepower, can rival the United States. According to Tokyo military experts, the Japanese fleet has a geographical advantage, which can enhance its attack power. If it takes a defensive position, it is virtually invincible. Combined with the original three islands of Japan and the islands acquired later, the Japanese Empire has become a solid dike along the coast of East Asia, starting from the Bering Strait and ending in Tokyo Bay. The South Sea Mandate islands protrude like a screen, and can be said to dominate the Western Pacific.

Under these circumstances, the United States naturally does not intend to attack Japan. Japan also does not intend to attack the United States. However, if the United States decides to actively resist Germany, regardless of Article 3 of the Tripartite Pact, the Japanese government's position will inevitably fall into difficulty. If Japan recklessly attacks the United States, it will not only incur domestic criticism, but also have to abandon its strong defensive position and fight far away from its base.

As for the goal of the Tripartite Pact, it is to keep the U.S. fleet in the Pacific, or at least not participate in the European war. This is clearly a condition for Germany to indirectly assist Japan in building a "New Order in East Asia."

Japan's current strategy is to make China lose its fighting power in order to end the war against China. The Japanese Navy has stepped up its blockade along the Chinese coast, and its naval aircraft have reduced Chongqing to ashes. The communication lines between Chongqing and the outside world have been mostly cut off. The occupation of Vietnam not only closed French ports, but also can be used as a starting point for cutting off the Burma Road. Japan also wants to use German influence to persuade Stalin to close the last route for the supply of Chinese weapons (this has already failed).

Japan believes that these realizable assets are of sufficient value to form an alliance with the European Axis powers. But one side is assets, and the other side is liabilities. Japan's economic ties with Germany are ridiculously small compared to the trade it needs with Britain and the United States.

Therefore, the new alliance formed by Japan, although it has various superficial benefits, is actually a gamble. Japan is betting that Germany can win in Europe without Britain deploying its full strength and U.S. aid. It is guessing that the United States, because it is unprepared, can only maintain strict neutrality and wait for Germany to complete its goals. However, once Article 3 of the alliance is implemented, Japan will feel greatly troubled. The war will destroy Japan's trade with the United States, and Japan's commercial markets within the British Empire will be uprooted. As for finding alternative markets and sources, they only exist on the paper of the "New Order." Every Japanese family and every industry will feel the impact of the war. Japan has already lost its profitable foreign trade, and the "New Order in East Asia" will only spread poverty. If the U.S. and British navies cooperate in the Pacific, the benefits Japan has gained will be like sand, unable to be consolidated. (Translated from a Tokyo dispatch of October 5th by the New York Times)

### Boldness and Carefulness

— Huang Lin

Boldness and also Careful, what does that saying mean? On the surface, it seems contradictory, impossible; children must also think that to be bold, one cannot be careful, to be careful, one cannot be bold. This is because we misunderstand the meaning of boldness and carefulness, and do not understand the relationship between boldness and carefulness.

The boldness I am talking about is not just relying on temporary courage and acting rashly, but when facing dangerous things, not panicking, and when encountering temporary things, being able to adapt to the situation, even if there are difficulties in peacetime, thinking of ways to overcome them, and acting with purpose and planned action, doing things step by step.

The carefulness I am talking about is not worrying about everything, fearing obstacles, fearing not being able to succeed, and not putting things into practice, wanting to escape reality, but paying attention to everything when facing things, not being careless, not being negligent, so as to reduce errors and make it easier for the cause to achieve success.

Therefore, boldness is the driving force for implementing or dealing with anything, and carefulness is the attention that should be paid to carrying out a cause. The two have a close relationship. If one is only bold and not careful, one is likely to encounter setbacks and difficulties at any time, or unexpected dangers. If one is only careful and not bold, one cannot do great things and cannot cope with sudden changes.

When we understand the above meaning and relationship, we will no longer feel the contradiction between them, but feel how important they are to our lives. We are in this rapidly changing era, and we are constantly threatened by dangers and troubled by huge difficulties. Our parents cannot always be there to protect us, and our teachers cannot always be there to supervise us. If we are not bold, we will learn to create fear everywhere. If we are not careful, harm can easily occur, and we will not be able to cope with unexpected events.

Children, let us train ourselves in peacetime, starting from small trivial matters to walking and learning, so that we can become a bold and careful child of the era.

### After Watching the Film "Young Edison"

— Su Ming

Last Sunday morning, Yong'er's father took his two brothers to the Dahua Cinema to see the film "Young Edison." Yong'er originally didn't really like watching movies, often dozing off in the dark cinema. However, after seeing this film, it aroused his interest, and he watched the whole film in one go without feeling tired at all. On the way home, he even asked his father to take him to the movies often. His father then said to him, "This kind of film is most suitable for children like you and is worth watching. But what are your thoughts after watching this film today? If not, I won't bring you out to watch it next time."

"Yes, yes," Yong'er said preemptively, because he hoped to go out to watch movies again next time. "Edison was the naughtiest child ever, Dad. Although we are naughty, we are not as naughty as him. He didn't study hard and caused trouble at school, and he was expelled from the whole school. I haven't done any of these things. However, Edison was very filial to his mother. When he heard the news that his mother was sick, he immediately rushed home to assist the doctor with the operation. He even came up with the idea of combining many kerosene lamps to reflect the light from a mirror to his mother's bedside to make it easier for the doctor to operate. He was really extremely clever. Moreover, he was also brave and dared to rescue passengers on the train. If I were there, I would have been very anxious. This is also where I am not as good as him, Dad, do you think so?"

"You're right, good, let your brother speak."

"Edison's childhood experiences were the worst possible. He was looked down upon by others and even called a mentally ill child. However, he was not discouraged by this and continued to study his scientific gadgets in the basement. He also liked to work. He worked as a vendor selling candy and newspapers on the train, and at the same time, he studied science on the train. Later, he even printed, edited, and sold his newspapers himself. This kind of work was so hard! However, he didn't find it difficult but thought it was very interesting. This spirit is worthy of our admiration."

"You said it very well. Let me speak last, listen to me: Although Edison was a naughty child, he listened to his mother very much. After being expelled from school, he studied on his own, and his mother often gave him guidance. Therefore, half of Edison's knowledge came from his mother's teaching, which led him to become a scientific giant. Therefore, you two should listen to your mother's words. Edison was able to invent various things, such as electric lights, movies, telephones, phonographs, etc., because he encountered countless difficulties, obstacles, and failures. However, he was able to endure and persistently research the reasons for these failures, making improvements again and again until he achieved final success. He didn't use the method of blindly studying books to research science but used various experiments to compensate for the shortcomings of scientific research. Moreover, when he worked, he always thought and constantly experimented to see if the facts matched what the books told us. If something didn't match, he would research the reason for the mismatch. This kind of research is effective. You usually suffer from this problem, always thinking that what is said in books is absolutely accurate, so you don't use your brains to think and don't experiment anymore. This kind of reading has very limited progress. The thoughts you two have shared today are quite good. I will take you to see the great Edison again next time." It can be known how hard Edison worked in his adulthood, which led him to make such great contributions to the whole world!

### Poor Children Without Winter Clothes

— Ying

The weather has entered the cold winter, and the climate is getting colder day by day. Everyone needs winter clothes! However, in Shanghai, this city, there are many people who still don't have winter clothes. In particular, there are many poor children whose winter clothing problem has not been solved yet! How pitiful this is! Ordinary children are already wearing coats and woolen sweaters, but those poor children are either wearing thin summer clothes or covering themselves with things like burlap sacks and straw mats as protection against the cold. If the merciless northwest wind continues to press down, they will not be able to survive this winter!

People who have clothes to wear will not know the suffering of people who have no clothes to wear. In the past few cold days, haven't many homeless people died on the streets every time? Although some of these deaths are due to other reasons, being frozen and cold is at least a major reason. Adults are like this, and children are naturally no exception. If the winter clothing problem is not solved, countless poor children will surely die from cold and starvation this winter. Children are the future masters of the country. The wrongful death of a child causes the country to lose a portion of its vitality. Therefore, this problem is quite serious and urgently needs to be solved!

Okay? Now, the Shanghai branch of the China Child Welfare Association has launched a campaign to solicit winter clothes for refugee children. Perhaps every child knows that the China Child Welfare Association is the only child welfare organization in China. After "August 13th," although it withdrew to the inland, it still has a branch office in Shanghai to carry out various child welfare work. It is truly benefiting poor children a lot. Regarding winter clothes for refugee children, they have held many events in the past. After the winter clothes are donated, they are made into cotton-padded clothes and distributed to poor children in various districts, such as refugee children, homeless children, and children in slum areas. However, in today's world of high prices, making a set of cotton-padded clothes is no longer the same as before. Cotton costs two yuan per catty. Last year, a set of cotton-padded clothes cost two yuan, but this year it costs six yuan. Therefore, the need for donations is even greater than in previous years. It is hoped that ordinary children can save various unnecessary expenses and actively donate. In addition to donations, old winter clothes are also needed. Many students have already started soliciting donations. It is hoped that children who have not participated will donate quickly so that they can save some poor children. It is truly a great benefit!

Sealed distillation of coal produces black viscous coal tar. Further refining of coal tar can produce many useful substances. Some are fuel oil, and some can be used as explosives. Carbolic acid for making medicated soap, beautiful bakelite, many kinds of non-fading dyes, indanthrene blue, mothballs, aspirin, etc. can all be made from it. Coal is really useful.

### Shirley Temple's Autobiography (25)

— Min

I received so many gifts in Honolulu that I could hardly keep track of them in my math lessons. Among them were black-haired Chinese and Japanese dolls, hula dolls wearing grass skirts, boxes of candy, rainbow-colored parasols, paper fans, surfboards, slippers for wearing at home, and all sorts of other things. Duke Kahanamoku of Honolulu signed his name on one of my surfboards and blessed me. He was a very famous and talented swimmer.

The naval officers in Honolulu took me to play on their warships docked in the harbor. They dressed me in a white uniform and called me "Rear Admiral Shirley." I also learned a real hula dance on Waikiki Beach, which was so much fun!

However, while I was having a lot of fun in Honolulu, I received some sad news. It turned out that the great star, poor Will Rogers, had unfortunately died tragically in Alaska. They notified my mother by telephone, and I cried incessantly when I heard. I loved Mr. Rogers very much, and my mother said that we would never see him again from now on. (The End)

### First Place in Elementary School Summer Homework Competition

My Teacher Zhou De Su, First Temporary Elementary School, Bureau of Works

My class teacher is Teacher Wang. She has a round face, curly hair, lively, speaking eyes, and walks very lightly.

Every time after the class bell rings, she walks in with a smile on her face and lectures very clearly. But sometimes, after class starts, we are still talking. When she comes, she shows a serious expression and remains silent. This silence means that Teacher Wang is angry. We all sit upright, and the students who broke the rules lower their heads even more.

Teacher Wang's lectures are very organized, so every student welcomes Teacher Wang's lectures. When lecturing, the teacher likes to use metaphors and likes to tell interesting stories. Sometimes, one sentence makes the whole class laugh heartily.

When we do well in our homework, she praises us and tells us stories. But when we don't work hard, she punishes us.

When we make mistakes, she often guides us, explaining the whole thing to us in a clear and organized way, so that we know where we are wrong and voluntarily correct ourselves. But if some students are not firm in their will and go out to play with wild children, they often make mistakes again and again. Then, she punishes them. But if that student is willing to correct their mistakes, the teacher still forgives them. Therefore, none of our classmates does not love Teacher Wang, and none of them is not afraid of Teacher Wang. I wish Teacher Wang good health and that she will always be a beacon for the children.

### Thoughts on the "Young Edison" Film "Young Edison" Essay Contest - Parent Category

— Second Place Sheng Cha

"At the beginning of the 'Young Edison' film, there is a subtitle that says, 'This story of courage, perseverance, and struggle can be said to be the experience of anyone in an American village, and that person just happens to be Edison.'"

The discipline of a strict father, the love of a kind mother, the shallow knowledge of the school authorities, and the ruthless contempt of relatives, friends, and neighbors are almost the inevitable environment of every great person. Edison, as a weak child, actually had the great ambition to help the world. Although schoolwork was not his strong point, he tirelessly researched and experimented in the basement day and night. The results he obtained often caused jokes and were ridiculed by the neighbors, even regarded as crazy. Even his own father found it difficult to forgive him. Fortunately, he had a kind mother who understood him, comforted him, and encouraged him, and finally, he became the head of the world's scientific community and a great benefactor of modern civilization.

However, if we pay close attention, we will find that children of the same age as Edison at that time, regardless of nationality, almost all have a curious nature and an interest in experimentation: a good doll is suddenly dissected by them, separating its head from its body; a good clock is suddenly studied by them, leaving not a single piece. The father is so angry that he roars like thunder, and although the mother also regrets that natural objects are being wasted, she can still endure it, so she persuades and comforts him in every possible way and lightly reprimands him. I ask, when we encounter this kind of situation, should we also regard this child as the future Edison, blaming the father for not understanding and praising this mother as being able to understand the greatness of her child? I think if everyone watches this film "Young Edison" and doesn't examine the causes and effects carefully, and every parent believes that a world inventor has emerged in their home, and every child sees themselves as a great scientific authority, I dare say that in the near future, there will be no need for enemy planes to bomb, and we will see fireworks rising all over the city and rubble flying everywhere.

Therefore, parents who watch this film should pay attention to every tiny part. They should know that although Edison's father treated his children very harshly, he was established in society and had to take the safety of society as a prerequisite. He knew from his loving wife's explanation that his son was not just fooling around, but since his son had offended the public, he would never let him off easily just because he thought he was a genius. Therefore, behind his stern mask, there was often a faint smile: heavy whippings were not lacking in gentle caresses. This is an extremely lovable model father.

Edison's mother was also not just an ignorant woman who doted on her children. She carefully watched every move her son made in the basement. She understood that her son's thirst for knowledge was purposeful and that his experiments were based on evidence. Therefore, her understanding of Edison was not just blind maternal love, and her fury at the teacher's accusations was not just selfish defense. If we rely on Edison's biography, then when Edison dropped out of school, she personally

### Zhangtai Willow

— Gu Mingdao

Jiangzi heard the word matchmaker and lay on the table, her face flushed, and said, "I don't want to, I don't want to. Master Zhang, don't joke. I want to be a monk in the future." The Confucian scholar said, "Monks are people who have left their families. Besides, there are no female monks. How can we allow a person like you, who can topple cities and ruin countries, to become a monk? There is no such thing in the world that spoils the scenery." As he said this, he turned to the beautiful woman on his left and said, "If so, aren't you surprised to hear what your sister says? She's still a child. You are all beautiful women. Haha, beautiful women and famous scholars complement each other." The beautiful woman held a small jade cup and only cared about slowly drinking from her cherry lips, her face pensive. Seeing the Confucian scholar speak to her, she said faintly, "This little woman has always respected her teacher's words, but today's words are somewhat disagreeable." Hearing this, the Confucian scholar couldn't help but be stunned and said, "How so? Did I say something wrong just now? I praised you for being as smart as ice and snow and praised you for being beautiful women. These are indeed sincere words. Not to mention the Songling area here, even in Jiangnan, if you want to praise beautiful women, you are the only ones. Besides, you are my female disciples, and I know your talented Yongxu. Seeking you in boudoirs, famous ladies, is still rare and hard to come by, let alone Zhangtai? If so, what do you think?" The beautiful woman nodded her neck and said, "Thank you for your kind praise, but I am ashamed to accept it. This little woman has been destined to be thin since childhood, and she has been reduced to the dust of the wind, flattering and smiling. When I think about it in the middle of the night, I feel like I am being pounded. How can I be called a beautiful woman? In the current situation, the government is losing control, and the world is restless. Seeing that the Central Plains is boiling and there is a danger of sinking, we need great heroes to come out to quell the chaos and defend against insults, and save the people from suffering, so that we can save this crumbling situation and establish a strange feat that will last for generations. The so-called situation creates heroes, and heroes are of course valuable, especially today. As for the teacher, he is of course Jiang Zuo Guan Yiwu, a peerless celebrity. But this little woman believes that we must not follow Tao Qingjie's return to the countryside and mark ourselves as bright festivals. When we seek the silk and bamboo of Xie Dongshan's Tao Qing, we must strategize to resist the enemy. If we do not have the skin, where will the hair be attached? If the mansion collapses, where will we be? Even if we want to improve ourselves, it is impossible. Does the teacher also think that this little woman is saying too much? I don't know the taboos, death is my sin."

(Three)

Since he had taught her for two years, it was no wonder that she absolutely did not admit that her son was crazy. I think the film should also show this fact, otherwise it will easily cause misunderstanding among the audience. Our conclusion on parental education from "Young Edison" is: Parents and children should be close. Parents should start with "understanding" when teaching their children. Unreasonable criticism and blind doting will hinder the development of genius.

### Shangyin Fellow Drama Society Kunqu Opera Rehearsal

— Lao

Since the Xianke Society stopped performing, Kunqu Opera has truly become a lost art. Yu Zhenfei belonged to the Golden Age and occasionally rehearsed one or two excerpts, but it was not enough to satisfy the audience. Yesterday, the Shangyin Fellow Drama Society rehearsed Kunqu Opera, which was quite a spectacle. The author had the pleasure of hearing the beautiful performance, so I recorded it as follows: The show started at seven o'clock. The cast was composed of famous actors from the Xiannisha Society. The first excerpt was "Looking at Hometown," with Chen Hongnian playing Su Wu. His pronunciation was loud, his dialogue was clear, and his acting was also very skilled. Li Ling, played by Chen Yujiu, had a scholarly appearance. It is said that both gentlemen were performing on stage for the first time, and their achievements were quite difficult to come by. The melodies of "Secret Oath," such as Erlangshen and Jixianbin, were all mellow and moving. Hu Zhangjun played Li Longji, which was appropriate for his status. The third excerpt was the Small Banquet from the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, with Zhu Xieqing playing Lu Bu. His singing was bright and his appearance was handsome. "Good Date" was played by Zhang Ya Fu, who played Zhang Junrui and was able to fulfill his duties, while You Boqun's Hong Niang had a glamorous appearance and radiated brilliance. The twelve reds each had a graceful and delicate figure. Bei Zuwu played Shi Peng in "Jing Qin Ji," singing and acting skillfully and expressing himself realistically. The last two excerpts were "Kneeling Pond" and "Arguing Vinegar." Mr. Ge Qifu's Chen Jichang flowed with elegant charm, and Chen Run Dejun's Dongpo saw the coward and shivered, and was frightened by the lion's roar. He was both refined and erudite, and both solemn and humorous. "Arguing Vinegar" was a meticulous masterpiece by Yin Zhenxian and Ye Xiaohong. Its high level of achievement cannot be overstated.

Since the war, I have not heard songs for a long time. I was quite excited by tonight's grand event. Perhaps the existence of Yangchun Baixue is not in vain.

### "London Can Take It"

— Liang Hao

The United States recently made a war documentary in England—"London Can Take It"—which has now been completed. The film is set against the backdrop of the German bombing of London, writing about the calm response of the British. All the air combat scenes were filmed on the ground. The dubbing description is as humorous and witty as the "Safety First" video. For example, when the British army's anti-aircraft guns are set up, the strong beams of searchlights cross in the air, and the alarm sounds and bomb explosions are heard at the same time, the dubbing explains: "This is not a Hollywood dubbing effect, but 100% real goods." At the end of the film, the scene is of British planes flying in formation to Berlin, indicating that Britain can not only cope with Nazi attacks, but also fight back!
