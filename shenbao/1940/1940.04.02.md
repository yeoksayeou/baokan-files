After the silence, Chairman Chiang delivered a speech, reporting on the national military, diplomatic, and political measures taken in the past six months and expressing fervent hopes for the current session. All councilors were exceptionally enthusiastic, listening intently for about forty minutes. Next, Chairman Lin of the National Government gave instructions, which were read on his behalf by Secretary-General Wang Shijie. Everyone stood and listened quietly.

Chairman Chiang's Opening Speech

Chongqing—In his opening speech at the Fifth Session of the National Political Council, Chairman Chiang stated that today marks the opening day of the Fifth Session of the Council. The number of attendees is particularly large compared to previous sessions. Even colleagues who are far abroad or have been convalescing in various places and unable to attend in the past have made the arduous journey to participate, reflecting a national spirit of unity in sharing weal and woe, which is deeply inspiring and gratifying. In particular, the work of the colleagues during the intersessions fully demonstrates our determination to take practical responsibility for the work of resistance and nation-building. Our Sichuan-Xikang Construction Promotion Association has established five offices, and the responsible colleagues regularly inspect various regions, report to the government, and provide a basis for all improvements. Our Constitutional Government Promotion Association has held multiple meetings to conduct detailed research on various constitutional issues. We organized a North China Inspection and慰问团, traveling to Shaanxi, Henan, Shanxi, Hebei, and other provinces to慰问 local soldiers and civilians. Our colleagues also participated in the Military Affairs Commission's Military Discipline Inspection Group, going to the front lines to assist in the rectification of military discipline. All colleagues participating in the above-mentioned work have been able to complete their tasks without fear of hardship or danger, and I express my respect to them, especially to those who participated in the work. It has been a full six months since the Fourth Session of the Council adjourned. The international situation has become tense due to the European war, and our war of resistance has also entered a more arduous stage. However, adhering to our established national policy, the front and rear have worked together to intensify the struggle, which has further strengthened the foundation of the war of resistance and brought the work of nation-building to scale. I will now give you a brief report on the military, diplomatic, and political measures taken in the past six months. First, regarding military affairs, at the close of the Fourth Session, I said, "China's fighting strength today is not only far superior to what it was a year ago but also exceeds the beginning of the war of resistance the year before last." Reviewing the past six months, I can say that our military strength in the war of resistance today is even more substantial than it was six months ago, and all techniques and organization have made even more progress. Therefore, the foundation for victory can be said to be completely laid. In the past six months, every time the Japanese army has made a move in northern Hunan, northern Guangdong, southern Guangxi, northern Hubei, southern Shanxi, or western Sui, it has suffered a fatal blow from us. The recent counteroffensive in Wuyuan and the recovery of Lingshan and Funan in southern Guangxi further prove that the Japanese army is at the end of its rope. The Japanese army's routs in northern Hunan and northern Guangdong prove that they will be defeated if they attack, and the Chinese army's recapture of Kunlun Pass proves that they will be destroyed if they defend. In total, the number of Japanese casualties in the past three months has increased by more than 230,000. In the future, they will only decline and be unable to recover, and our strategy will be able to give them fatal blows at any time and in any place, so that they will each come to die within our vast territory, be isolated, and be annihilated in their entirety. Second, regarding diplomacy, we have adhered to the key point of "responding to all changes with constancy" that I reported at the last session, consistently adhering to the established policy. Although the international situation is complex and tense, our position is very simple and clear. Our allies around the world not only have a clear understanding of China, but also unanimously sympathize with us. Although war has broken out in Europe, the moral and material assistance from European and American countries to China has only increased in the past six months. The establishment of a US$20 million loan from the United States is immensely inspiring. Generally speaking, when the Soviet-Finnish war broke out, it seemed that the international situation became more complicated. Now that the Soviet-Finnish war has been restored to peace, the scope of the European war has been reduced. The relationship between the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom, the United States, and France is likely to become closer. I believe that the Soviet Union and all peace-loving countries in the world will be able to stand on the same point of view to safeguard international justice and cooperate to implement its consistent peace advocacy and restore peace to the world and East Asia. Third, regarding our political facilities, the various ministries will submit individual reports to the conference on the detailed progress of the administrative work in the past six months. What I want to explain to you now is the center of our administrative planning and implementation in the past six months. In addition to the negative prohibitions of banning concubinage, gambling, eliminating bandits, and providing relief to those suffering from disease, we are also working hard to promote health and promote sports. All of these have achieved considerable results. Our active work focuses on internal affairs and economics. A. Regarding internal affairs, we pay special attention to promoting local autonomy and enriching grassroots politics to establish a constitutional foundation. In September last year, the government promulgated the "Outline of County-Level Organizations." On the one hand, it planned the training of autonomous personnel, and on the other hand, it formulated various implementation regulations and raised the necessary funds, and decided to start implementing it uniformly throughout the country from this year.

Editorial

### The Complete Failure of Japan's Diplomatic Offensive

Ambition belongs to Japan, conspiracies and tricks belong to Japan, but what about the future? I don't need to reason, our opinion is that Japan's current strategy is painstaking and useless. At least, as a Japanese soldier told an American reporter, "It is very vague and difficult to achieve results."

Honesty belongs to China, time and space belong to China. Japan has wasted its efforts and spared no expense in deception. Not to mention providing China with more and better time and space, at least Japan cannot gain anything from time and space. Looking at the speech of the British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, his words were vague and his intentions ambiguous, not yet to the point of openly flattering Japan's current strategy, but it immediately aroused honest indignation and criticism in his home country and on the other side of the Pacific Ocean in the United States. Looking at Japan's current strategy once it took concrete shape, it immediately aroused the honest declaration of US Secretary of State Hull. Mr. Hull candidly expressed the honest attitude of the United States. He said, "The United States still maintains its right to uphold international law and existing treaties. The United States government, together with other countries, unanimously recognized the National Government of the Republic of China twelve years ago. The United States is convinced that the capital of the Chinese government is in Chongqing, so the United States government has always recognized the National Government as the only legal government in China." The US loan of another 20 million US dollars to China is undoubtedly a huge sum. It is sincere sympathy and strong support for China. It is a merciless reprimand and serious blow to the aggressor. However, Mr. Hull's declaration the day before yesterday is indeed of supreme value, and it cannot be compared with 20 million US dollars or any huge sum. As for the Soviet Union, its government authorities have not directly expressed their views, but the articles and discussions in the newspapers under the Soviet political system have exposed everything without leaving any room. No one can deny that this is a sign of the Soviet government's attitude. Ambassador Craigie's speech should not be regarded as the attitude of the United Kingdom, let alone regarded as France sharing the same view. Looking at yesterday's dispatches from London and Paris, the official positions of the United Kingdom and France, in response to the current clouds in the Far East, stated that "the entire policy remains unchanged and still recognizes the administrative organs under the leadership of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek as the only national government of China."

It is Japan that is disturbing the Far East. As for stabilizing the Far East, China should do more of its obligations, and has already done a great deal of obligation, and is continuing to do great labor. In addition, the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and France are all important factors in stabilizing the Far East. Now that Japan has just begun to concretize its current strategy, the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and France have responded "unambiguously" as expected, as mentioned above. Although yesterday's dispatch from Tokyo stated that the Japanese authorities called this reaction "as expected", unless it is a primitive animal, using calmness to suppress anxiety and using indifference to conceal embarrassment, "as expected." Because analyzing Japan's current strategy, if it still confidently uses the way it handles domestic problems to deal with the so-called "China Incident", that is, if it does not regard the Sino-Japanese War as an international problem but as unrelated to the international community, then it would not need the current strategy from the beginning. Therefore, the form of this strategy of Japan seems to be a political offensive against China, but its essence is a diplomatic offensive against the international community. Having used the current strategy and immediately received such a clear and honest response from the international community, it is still said to be "as expected", and it seems to allow disregarding the international community and allowing ignoring it indifferently, which is obviously a deception. Analyzing Japan's original intention, it wants to disguise the international normal and legal way, so it negotiates, concludes treaties, signs, "initials", approves, and exchanges documents, and all the procedures of bureaucratic politics are complete and complete. Then, one hand is "document", and the other hand is the fact, placing it in front of the various countries. Analyzing Japan's tactics, perhaps the Japanese authorities are using bureaucratic political glasses to observe the countries? Or perhaps they received wrong reports from overseas officials? Or perhaps they bought counterfeit goods from foreign spy personnel? It actually mistakenly believed that as long as the "documents" are complete and the facts are present, the countries will shut their mouths and remain silent, and the countries will pretend to be foolish and acknowledge it. Who knows that the countries are not foolish and immediately have a clear and honest response! The decisiveness of the response is like cutting nails and cutting iron! This is really beyond Japan's expectations. If it is said that the Japanese authorities are not anxious or embarrassed because of this, unless they are really foolish, they are pretending to be foolish.

In terms of Japan's entire strategy towards China, all military offensives, economic offensives, and political offensives are internal operations in the entire strategy. The diplomatic offensives that are vertical and horizontal in the international community are roundabout operations in the entire strategy. The purpose of the internal operations is to destroy the Chinese body and eventually collapse it. The purpose of the roundabout operations is to isolate China's international community and eventually suffocate it. Internal destruction and external collapse, in the beginning, he used both methods to speed up China's demise. Recently, although he has not stopped its internal operations, he believes that success in roundabout operations is enough to control China's fate, so he has exhausted his efforts to engage in this aspect. Now, Japan's internal strategy is failing in every way. It is clear that the final and decisive failure is not far away. His roundabout strategy has been definitively proven to have been a complete failure due to the international response in these two or three days!

Therefore, we diagnose that Japan has reached a major turning point.

This work is, of course, a difficult and huge work, but in order to strengthen the power of resistance and promote the success of nation-building, we must complete it quickly with the greatest determination and effort. We must enable the people to receive practical training in exercising their four rights, enable the people to be organized, improve conscription, enrich local forces, and popularize national education. All of these cannot be achieved without implementing this system. I hope that all colleagues will work together and promote it together. B. Regarding economic affairs, we pay special attention to the development of economic construction and the enrichment of financial power. For economic construction, it is necessary to increase industrial and mining production, and also to expand agricultural production. In terms of industry and mining, in addition to actively proceeding in accordance with the established plan, we have recently formulated a further expansion plan, increased funding, and promoted it within a limited time. At the same time, we feel that the sufficiency of war resources and people's daily necessities must fundamentally start from the development of agriculture. Therefore, future facilities must do their best to develop the agricultural economy, enrich rural finance, and increase farmers' production. The independent establishment of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry is to enable agricultural and forestry reclamation to have a dedicated agency. From now on, we must actively promote it according to this policy, and strive to reduce the unnecessary burdens and pains of our people during the war and increase the general welfare of our hard-working people. As for financial affairs, what should be mentioned in particular is the establishment of the Joint Office of the Four Banks. Because in the past two years, the financial foundation has become increasingly solid, and the state's revenue and expenditure have not felt short, a large part of it has benefited from the sound preparation and effective implementation of pre-war financial policies. Now, if we want to step up economic construction, we must further concentrate the strength of financial institutions to promote our entire economic policy. Since the establishment of the Joint Office of the Four Banks, it has been working hard to promote the expansion of the financial network, establish the stability of the foreign exchange base, and absorb and lend production funds. Looking back at the past six months, the contributions and achievements of the four banks have been extremely high. From now on, we must gradually promote it, so that our economic construction can be completed more quickly due to the increase in financial power. The above is a summary of our military, diplomatic, and political facilities in the past six months. Let us take a look at the situation of the Japanese. I have already said that the Japanese military power is declining. What is not necessary to say again is that the domestic political and economic situation has reached the point of collapse. In terms of economy, its total budget this year reached 16 billion yen. Public debt cannot be sold, banknotes are continuously over-issued, rural labor is becoming increasingly scarce, and coal and electricity shortages make it impossible to maintain industry. The people's lives are extremely uneasy, the social foundation is shaking everywhere, and fires are frequent, causing heavy losses. Man-made disasters and natural disasters are countless. In terms of politics, the military is becoming increasingly arbitrary. Just looking at the various events in the Abe cabinet's resignation, the Yonai's ascendance, followed by Saito's departure, and even the 75th session of its parliament in the past few months, it can be seen that only a few soldiers are now dominating everything. It is wholeheartedly trying to disturb East Asia, but it calls itself (establishing a new order in East Asia), intentionally excluding the legitimate rights and interests of various countries in the Far East. Instead, it deceives itself and sings "cooperation" while looking at the opportunity of the European war, trying to speculate and take advantage of it. At the same time, it is trying to play with the great powers and defeat them one by one. Who can't see through this kind of intention? Let's take one or two examples. Japan initially opposed the Soviet Union and enticed Europe and the United States, but the countries of Europe and the United States were not deceived by it. Then it wanted to threaten Europe and the United States by approaching the Soviet Union, but it was despised by the Soviet Union, and the countries of Europe and the United States were not intimidated. Now it wants to use the disguise of anti-Soviet to ease the countries of Europe and the United States. Is there any such stupid attitude that is not universally abandoned by the great powers? (To be continued)

### British Government Does Not Want to Change Its China Policy: Recognizes the Only Legitimate Government in China as Being in Chongqing; French Newspaper Says the Situation in the Far East Has Not Changed Much

London: According to official sources, some commentators suggest that the recent remarks made by British Ambassador to Japan Craigie in Tokyo are a sign of Britain changing its Far Eastern policy. Although Britain does not want to develop friendly relations with Japan, its overall policy remains unchanged. Britain still recognizes the administrative organ led by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek as the only National Government of China. (31st Reuters Dispatch)

London: The political correspondent of the Daily Mail expressed his personal opinion that the British government does not want to withdraw its diplomatic recognition of the Chongqing government, nor does it want to grant recognition to the new regime. However, this should not be interpreted as Britain being hostile to the new regime. If there is any sign of a step that could end the Sino-Japanese War on fair terms, British diplomats will cooperate. (1st Reuters Dispatch)

Paris: The "government" established by Wang Jingwei in Nanjing has recently been commented on by the Paris Times, saying, "This government is the product of Japan's extensive diplomatic efforts and large-scale military operations in China. However, whether the evolution of the situation in the Far East has entered a decisive stage can be found by considering the following matters. The Japanese army has been waging an undeclared war against China for two and a half years. Although several provinces in northern and central China and most of the coastline have been effectively occupied, there are still great difficulties in making China and 'Manchukuo' form a group under Japanese control and implement a permanent cooperation plan. The current problem lies in how to form a central regime from the local regimes supported by the Japanese, that is, a regime that can cooperate with Japan in a spirit of mutual trust. Although the 'Wang Government' has been established, Japan is still at war with China. The army commanded by General Chiang Kai-shek is still resisting Japan, and the attitude of the Chinese National Government remains as strong as ever. Under such circumstances, it is not easy for Japan to complete its mission. In other words, Japan must continue to fight until its goals are fully achieved. In China, the forces that are unwilling to cooperate with Japan still exist. All these are political realities exposed after the establishment of the 'Wang Government,' which no one can erase. In addition, since the 'Wang Government' has not been recognized by various countries, and the National Government is still recognized by various countries as the only legitimate government, the United States has already issued a statement on this, which shows that the establishment of the 'In Government' is not enough to make much change to the current situation."

### Future of the Yonai Cabinet: Many Difficulties; Economy Difficult to Adjust; Control Policies Difficult to Implement

Tokyo: It is expected that since the Yonai Cabinet has passed the difficult hurdle in the Diet, it will now devote all its efforts to implementing its policy of resolving the China Incident along the lines it has previously outlined. The Yonai government is currently facing major political events: (1) Recognition of the regime in China, (2) Adjustment of relations with third countries that have interests in China, (3) Completion of Japan's wartime economic system, (4) Compilation of a realistic budget for the next fiscal year. Regarding the third item, its main points are the problem of prices and increasing the production and supply of war materials and daily necessities. The Price Conference is expected to be established within days, and the public is paying close attention to the true functions of this group. Observers believe that the Japanese government's low-price policy and its expansion of production procedures are difficult to adjust. The supply of rice, coal, fertilizer, and other important items will inevitably be greatly affected by government control. Whether the current government wins popular support will largely depend on the results of this control. Regarding the fourth item, the compilation of a realistic budget, the Japanese government has not yet expressed its policy. According to observers, the compilation of a realistic budget is inevitable, and the army and navy budgets will be affected. It is expected that some parties will oppose the compilation of a realistic budget, so the government will probably encounter serious political difficulties in handling this matter. Even the fate of the Yonai Cabinet will depend on this. As for political issues not directly related to the China Incident, there are the National Spiritual Mobilization Movement and the revision of the government officials appointment and removal system, etc. However, Prime Minister Yonai and other cabinet members have not yet made concrete statements on these issues.

### US Congress Supports Hull Declaration; Some Suggest Immediately Severing Relations with Japan

Washington: The Democratic and Republican members of both houses of the US Congress today expressed enthusiastic support for Secretary of State Hull's statement last week that the United States refused to recognize the "New Nanjing Nationalist Puppet Government." Some suggestions for imposing an embargo on Japan and other punitive measures are still being treated with caution. Democratic Senator King called for the United States to immediately sever relations with Japan, but Independent Senator Shipstead warned the United States "not to attempt to correct the evils of the old world." (1st Associated Press Dispatch)

New York: The New York People's Forum recently severely criticized the "Nanjing Wang Jingwei Government," stating, "If Japan hopes to achieve practical results by establishing this kind of 'puppet government,' it is too 'fantasy.' If the 'Wang Government' asks the United States to return the concessions and leased territories it holds within China in the future, it may 'annoy' the United States. It should be known that American public opinion will not pay attention to any policies issued by these Chinese traitors who work for the Japanese army. The Japanese government was reportedly scheduled to immediately recognize the 'Wang Jingwei Government' after its establishment. If this is indeed the case, then all the clauses of the Washington Nine-Power Treaty will be violated by Japan, just as the country previously established the 'Manchukuo Government,' which will be even more undeniable. In this situation, we believe that the United States should immediately prohibit the transport of various military supplies to Japan, but there is no need to send an expeditionary force or use the navy to attack Japan. It is enough for us to implement a blockade against Japan in the ports of the western Pacific." (1st Havas Dispatch)

New York: The New York Herald Tribune commented on the "New Regime" in Nanjing, saying, "We have no reason to imagine that the establishment of a pseudo regime protected by Japan will have any practical impact on the military situation. Observed from overseas, its significance is nothing more than another violation of treaties by Japan, and it can prove that its previous repeated violations were premeditated and intentional. If China is allowed to be divided into Manchuria and central China, then its violation of the text of the treaty is similar to Japan's formal annexation of the territory it occupies." The newspaper concluded, "We can certainly say that the performance in Nanjing is one of the weakest and most clumsy instances of Eastern hypocrisy." (1st Reuters Dispatch)

### Arida Feels More Distressed After Hull's Declaration; Says the Attitude of Third Countries Is Not Worth Caring About; Suma Hopes to Improve Japan-US Relations

Tokyo: Foreign Minister Arida is now on a trip to the Kansai region to report on his duties as Foreign Minister to the Grand Shrine. Arida told reporters at the New Osaka Hotel that he was unable to criticize reports that the United States would not recognize the "Nanjing New Regime" when he received the official report in the United States. However, in his opinion, judging from the United States' attitude towards the Manchurian Incident, it was not unexpected for the US government to make this statement. The establishment of the "Nanjing New Regime" is a courageous achievement, aiming to seek the happiness of the Chinese people and the peace of East Asia. The "New Regime" has no intention of excluding the legitimate rights and interests of third countries. What it wants now is to readjust Sino-Japanese relations based on the three principles of good neighborly friendship, joint anti-communism, and economic cooperation. Moreover, the Japanese government is currently conducting large-scale military operations, which is an undeniable fact, and what could not be expected in the ordinary situation is now happening. Third countries misunderstand the above two points, so Japan does not care whether third countries recognize the "New Regime" or not, but will improve the situation until third countries have to recognize it. (1st Reuters Dispatch)

Tokyo: Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma stated this morning at a press conference that the Japanese government will continue to make every effort to improve relations between Japan and the United States. Japan's efforts to achieve stability and peace in China are a disturbing factor in this effort for the United States. He hopes that the US government will be patient and wait for the results of Japan's efforts. The "Nanjing New Regime" will be completely independent and has nothing to do with "Manchukuo." (1st Reuters Dispatch)

Tokyo: Japanese Foreign Minister Arida and Foreign Ministry Information Bureau Director Suma have recently made statements frequently sending overtures to the United States, probably hoping that the United States would adopt a realistic policy on the day of the establishment of the "Nanjing Wang Jingwei Government." However, it was undoubtedly beyond the expectations of the Japanese that US Secretary of State Hull declared in no uncertain terms that the country would never recognize this "New Government." However, the Japanese still appear calm on the surface. Knowledgeable sources have interpreted this, saying that since the United States abolished the 1911 US-Japan Treaty of Commerce, the Japanese government and newspapers have actively carried out a propaganda campaign among the people, arguing that no matter what the United States thinks or does about the situation in the Far East, Japan will ignore it and move forward single-mindedly. Today, the general public's lack of excessive shock at Hull's declaration is probably due to this. For this reason, some foreign observers here believe that Hull's announcement will not only not stop Japan's progress, but the Japanese government may even use it to stimulate people's hearts, so that the general public's determination not to allow Western countries to interfere in Japan's actions can be strengthened. Those in the government say that the policies pursued by the United States in the Far East are gradually diverging from those of Britain and France. For example, the speech delivered by British Ambassador to Japan Craigie the other day was worded exceptionally gently and was sufficient to offset the blow given to Japan by Hull's declaration. However, it is necessary to understand whether the lack of cooperation between the United States and Britain and France is due to genuine differences of opinion or whether they have already secretly agreed to deceive Japan. In short, the Japanese believe that the views of the British and French authorities are completely different from those of the United States, and therefore believe that the British and French authorities may not respond to Hull's declaration. Therefore, Japan can still maneuver between the United States and Britain and France. That is how it views Hull's declaration. (1st Havas Dispatch)

### US Naval Maneuvers Begin Yesterday

New York: The US Navy began large-scale exercises in the Pacific Ocean today, with 130 warships and 500 aircraft participating.

### Economic Problems in North China Are Extremely Serious; Japanese Side Considers It Tricky

Tokyo: The Japanese Times recently commented on the economic problems in North China, stating, "The New Government" is currently facing "two major problems" that urgently need to be resolved. First, how should Tianjin, which was a major commercial hub connecting North and South China before the war, restore its original position? Second, 80% of the people in North China are engaged in agriculture, and they were able to be self-sufficient in agricultural products in the past. Now, they need to rely on Japan for food. How should this abnormal state be corrected? The economic problems in North China are extremely serious. Before the outbreak of the China Incident, the trade volume between Tianjin and Central and South China, especially Shanghai, reached over 100 million yen, accounting for about half of Tianjin's total trade. However, since the outbreak of the war, this trade relationship has been hit hard. Tianjin and Central and South China can no longer maintain contact and are completely Japanized. However, the goods that Japan exports to the yen bloc have also been restricted. Its trade volume with Tianjin, which originally accounted for 80% of the total, also fell to 45% in 1939. In terms of goods, wheat flour is the main import from Japan, with a value of 75 million yen, accounting for 30% of the total import volume. North China is vast and rich in resources, but it needs to rely on foreign countries for food, which shows that its agricultural economy has fundamentally problems. In short, the interruption of Tianjin's commercial relationship with South China and the stagnation of the agricultural economy have caused North China's foreign trade to change from a surplus to a deficit. Before the China Incident, Tianjin's surplus reached 40 million yen, but by 1938, it had a deficit of 55 million yen. By the end of September 1939, the deficit had increased to 192 million yen. One of the reasons for this situation is the high price increase in Tianjin. For example, wheat flour, which sold for only 5 yen per bag last summer, now costs 30 yen. Sugar, which was originally 30 yen per bag, has also risen to 130 yen. Because of the continuous rise in prices, the public's hoarding is becoming more and more intense, and the import volume has increased accordingly. Therefore, at the beginning of the establishment of the "New Government," the economic rehabilitation of North China is indeed a tricky problem. (30th Havas Dispatch)

### Anglo-French Blockade Policy to Enter New Phase: Restrictions on Goods Imported to Neutral Countries; Territorial Waters System Reportedly to Change

London. Diplomatic circles here claim that the blockade policy implemented by Britain and France against Germany is about to enter a new phase, with its effectiveness reaching its peak in late summer and early autumn. So far, Britain and France have only inspected goods carried by merchant ships of various countries within the scope of international law. Although this has been remarkably effective and has caused great difficulties for Germany, there are still various shortcomings. For this reason, Britain and France have decided to take stringent measures to restrict neutral countries from purchasing goods on behalf of Germany. However, when implementing this policy, the traditional approach to the rights of belligerent countries must also be changed. Britain and France value the fate of millions of people and will not sit idly by while Germany openly violates international law and ties its own hands. Although there has been no official statement on this matter, the territorial waters system may be changed in the shortest possible time. All neutral countries bordering Germany, especially the Soviet Union, have large stocks of goods and will be closely monitored to prevent them from aiding the enemy. (Havas dispatch from the 1st)

Rome. The speech delivered by the British First Lord of the Admiralty, Mr. Churchill, yesterday has been commented on by various newspapers here, saying that Britain and France will definitely intensify the implementation of the blockade policy against Germany, and the method will almost restrict the import of goods into neutral countries, so as not to be shipped to Germany due to surplus. The implementation of this method will be determined separately based on the actual needs of each country. (Havas dispatch from the 1st)

Amsterdam. Dutch political circles believe that the recent speech by the British First Lord of the Admiralty, Mr. Churchill, is a harbinger of the Allied Powers tightening the blockade. It is expected that the Allied Powers will strengthen the control of neutral countries' exports to eliminate the possibility of food being transported to Germany. (Reuters dispatch from the 1st)

Paris. Political circles here fully agree with the speech of the British First Lord of the Admiralty, Mr. Churchill, and believe that this is the latest and most powerful statement by the Allied Powers to explain their position to neutral countries. What is particularly welcome in the speech are two points: one is that the Allied Powers' enemy is only Germany, and the other is that the Allied Powers do not want to fight against the Soviet Union unless forced by circumstances. (Reuters dispatch from the 1st)

Stockholm. The recent speech by the British First Lord of the Admiralty, Mr. Churchill, mentioned that neutral countries supply Germany with raw materials, which prolongs the war. Political circles here cannot see the reason for this, believing that Britain's emphasis on Sweden's export of iron ore has only recently emerged, and before the outbreak of the war, this type of export was only considered a secondary trade. (Reuters dispatch from the 1st)

Berlin. Newspapers here have made many sarcastic comments on Mr. Churchill's speech. The "People's Observer" stated that Mr. Churchill believes that if neutral countries can join the Allied Powers' front, the war can be ended. However, neutral countries already know Britain's attitude towards Abyssinia, the Spanish Republican Army, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Finland. Other newspapers also ridiculed Mr. Churchill's statement that the total population of Britain and France is 110 million, because the population of Britain is only 42 million, and the population of France is only 38 million, totaling 80 million. It is unknown where Mr. Churchill will obtain the remaining 30 million. (Haitong dispatch from the 1st)

### Resolution of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union: The New Finnish Republic Incorporated into the Soviet Union; Amendment to Article 13 of the Soviet Constitution

Moscow. The second joint session of the two chambers of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union was held here tonight, presided over by Mr. Shvernik. The meeting discussed the second item on the agenda, namely, changing the Karelian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic into the Karelian-Finnish Soviet Socialist Union Republic. On this point, Deputy Zhdanov delivered a speech, which was well received. After a short discussion, the two chambers voted separately, and finally unanimously passed the above-mentioned case. At the same time, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union also decided to request the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and the Supreme Soviet of the Karelian-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic to submit the accurate demarcation plan of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and the Karelian-Finnish Republic to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union for consideration. It was also decided to hold an election of representatives to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union in the new republic, and authorized the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet to determine the date of the election.

In addition, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union decided to amend Article 13 of the Soviet Constitution to include the Karelian-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic into the Soviet Union. (TASS dispatch from the 31st)

### The Origin of the Name of the New Republic: Report by Zhdanov

Moscow. Regarding the renaming of the Karelian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic to the Karelian-Finnish Soviet Socialist Union Republic, Mr. Zhdanov recently reported at the second joint session of the two chambers: "According to the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty, the new territories should be transferred from Finland to the Soviet Union. These new territories, especially the Karelian Isthmus, are military bases for attacking Leningrad and the Soviet Union. However, thanks to the heroic operations of the Red Army, the most dangerous war zone on our northwestern border has been eliminated. It has now become a peaceful barrier, guaranteeing the safety of Leningrad, Murmansk, and the Murmansk Railway.

It is found that the new territory covers a total area of 36,000 square kilometers. Therefore, issues such as the organization and economic and cultural development of the area require special attention. Except for a small part, the new territory is connected to the Karelian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, and is similar to the republic in terms of history and national livelihood. Therefore, when discussing the organization of the new territories received by the Soviet Union from Finland, the People's Committee gave full consideration to the legitimate and fair opinions of the workers of the Karelian Republic. Except for a small area directly connected to Leningrad, the new territory should be merged into the Karelian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, together with the cities of Fanpu, Anteria, Kekesen, Sotavala, Suuchavi, and Gaoluchavi. The People's Committee made an appropriate proposal to the Supreme Soviet, requesting consideration. If the Supreme Soviet accepts this proposal, the People's Committee will submit another proposal, which is also the opinion of the workers of the Karelian Republic, proposing to change the Karelian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic into the Karelian-Finnish Soviet Socialist Union Republic.

The Karelian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic has become a glorious land of the Soviets. Under the leadership of the world's workers' leader, Stalin, and the Bolshevik Party, the republic is gradually realizing Lenin-Stalin's national policy. With the support of the Soviet people, the Karelian people have made important achievements in socialist construction and the development of national culture. After we merge the new territories into Karelia, we have enhanced the importance of Karelia and given it important new tasks in terms of national economic and cultural development. The People's Committee and the workers of Karelia are deeply convinced that this newly organized Karelian-Finnish Republic can accomplish this new task.

The Soviet government has now taken steps to connect the areas leading to the Soviet Union and the original area of the Karelian Isthmus. The Petrovitsevtsk-Souchovi Railway, which has already been built, has connected the capital of Karelia and the Murmansk Railway with the Sutaifanla-Fanpu line. In addition, the Gandelaksha-Guluchovi line is currently under construction and will be completed soon. This line will connect the main part of Karelia with the Guluchovi area leading to the Soviet Union.

The industries incorporated into the Karelian territory, except for a small part, are handled by the Karelian-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic.

After the Karelian Republic is changed to a federation this time, its name needs to be discussed. It is found that the area leading to Karelia is not entirely Karelian. A part is purely Finnish territory. The Finnish and Karelian people have close relations in terms of race and blood. This time, changing the Karelian Autonomous Republic into the Karelian-Finnish Republic will definitely enable the two nations to achieve further development in economy and culture, and further enhance their friendship. At the same time, their years of accumulated hatred will also be eliminated. The People's Committee of the Soviet Union recently exercised its power and drafted regulations on the renaming of Karelia, and submitted them to the Supreme Soviet for review.

This new republic is about to join the other republics of the Soviet Union. This is a major new development in the unity of the various federations of the Soviet Union. During this period of imperialist enslavement of the people, imperialist wars have sharpened national and colonial oppression, and the rights and interests of small countries have become the change in the hands of imperialists. The establishment of our new republic during this period is enough to emphasize the benefits of the Soviet system in guaranteeing the full development of small countries.

I am deeply convinced that the Karelian-Finnish Republic will not only become a barrier to peace and security on the northwestern border of the Soviet Union, but will also become one of the most progressive members of the republic. (TASS dispatch from the 31st)

### Italian Newspaper Criticizes Soviet Policy, Accusing it of Taking Advantage of the Situation

Rome. The speech delivered by the Soviet Foreign Minister, Mr. Molotov, at the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union the other day has been commented on by the "Standemba" newspaper. This is the first reaction from Italian newspapers. It said, "Although Mr. Molotov's speech was extremely激烈, its content was still ambiguous. However, looking at this speech, the country's attitude since September of last year has been fully exposed. It is found that the country's intention is to make full use of the European war and to take advantage of the situation in Poland and the Baltic coast, and to try to obtain strongholds in Bulgaria and Turkey. In other words, it is pursuing a realistic opportunistic neutral policy towards the European war, waiting for the development of the situation, and its invasion of Finland is one aspect of this policy. At this time, Stalin has already restored his 'neutral' position, waiting for the belligerent countries on both sides to provide the best opportunity to realize his imperialist ambitions and the plans of the Tsarist Russia, so as to promote Bolshevism to the whole of Europe and Asia." (Havas dispatch from the 31st)

Rome. The speech delivered by the Soviet Foreign Minister, Mr. Molotov, at the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union yesterday has been commented on by various newspapers here. The "Times" stated, "The last paragraph of Mr. Molotov's speech declared that the Soviet Union aims to guarantee peace, security, maintain neutrality, and avoid joining the war. This statement is enough to satisfy the various neighboring countries of the country who want to stay out of the war. In Romania, it has always dared not lag behind in supporting peace and ensuring the security of neighboring countries. However, Mr. Molotov's statement that there is no mutual non-aggression treaty between the Soviet Union and Romania is wrong. It is found that the Paris Non-Aggression Pact has been implemented between the Soviet Union and Romania at the request of the Soviet Union. The multilateral agreement signed in London on July 3, 1933, was not signed solely by the Soviet Union and Romania, but it also clearly stipulates the obligation of mutual non-aggression."

### The Soviet Union Temporarily Does Not Appoint Ambassador to France

Geneva. Well-informed sources in French political circles have received reports from Moscow that the Soviet Union will not appoint a new ambassador for the time being after recalling the ambassador to France, Mr. Suritz. According to newspaper reports, the Soviet Embassy in Paris is currently guarded by the French secret police. (Haitong dispatch from the 1st)

### Full Text of Molotov's Speech (Continued from Yesterday)

On April 17, 1919, the London "Times" stated, "If we look at a map, we will know that the easiest way from the Baltic Sea to Leningrad is Finland, because the Finnish border is only 十英里 away from Leningrad. In short, Finland is the key to Leningrad, and Leningrad is the key to Moscow.

If we do not trust this plan of the British and French imperialists, then the recent facts in Finland can dispel this distrust. The failure of this plan is not only due to the lack of enthusiasm of the anti-Soviet elements on the British and French sides and the final restoration of reason in Finland, Sweden, and Norway. The failure of this plan is actually due to the glorious achievements of the Red Army in Karelia. What is the basic significance of the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty? The peace treaty has guaranteed the safety of Leningrad and Murmansk. This time, our hopes should be slightly different from those of last autumn. If the Finnish side had accepted our demands last autumn, the war would not have occurred. We have already shed blood in the war. Now we deeply believe that the Finnish government's attitude of hostility towards the Soviet Union is too great, so we have to guarantee the safety of Leningrad on a more solid foundation. When mentioning the issue of the Murmansk Railway and the safety of Murmansk, it is because Murmansk is our only ice-free port in the west, which is extremely important to our foreign trade. We have no other goals in signing the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty this time other than guaranteeing the safety of Leningrad and the Murmansk Railway. However, we believe that this issue must be resolved on a permanent basis. The Soviet-Finnish peace treaty fully recognizes the independence of Finland and expresses the necessity of guaranteeing the safety of Leningrad and the northwestern border of the Soviet Union. Our goal has now been achieved and we are very satisfied with the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty. The economic and political relations between the Soviet Union and Finland have now fully returned to normal. Our government is deeply convinced that the relations between the two countries will definitely develop further. However, we have to warn against certain aspects of the Finnish side's attempts to undermine the peace treaty. Sweden and Finland are now planning to form a so-called military alliance. The Norwegian leader, Mr. Hambro, even suggested that Finland "restore its lost territories" and said that the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty cannot last. From this point of view, the so-called Swedish-Finnish alliance is nothing more than aimed at the Soviet Union. It is found that this issue not only violates Article 3 of the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty, but also violates the entire peace treaty, because the peace treaty has clearly delineated the Soviet-Finnish border. If Finland is loyal to the peace treaty, it will never participate in this alliance. As for Sweden and Norway, if they also participate in this alliance, they have obviously violated their neutrality. The Soviet Union cannot understand their new diplomatic policy. We believe that we have no need to have disputes with Sweden and Norway. The relations between the Soviet Union, Sweden, and Norway should develop normally.

As for the rumors that the Soviet Union demanded to occupy the west coast of Scandinavia and Narvik, etc., they are all anti-Soviet propaganda and not worth laughing at.

So-called "socialist" gentlemen such as Mr. Hangglun of Sweden and Mr. Tolaimier of Norway are attempting to undermine the relations between the Soviet Union and Sweden and Norway. They have obviously been bought by foreign capitalists and sold out the interests of their own countries.

The Soviet-Finnish peace treaty has also resolved the Soviet Union's security issues in the Baltic Sea. The peace treaty supplements the mutual assistance agreements signed by the Soviet Union and the three countries of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. According to the experience we have gained in the past six months, these agreements have consolidated the international status of the signatory countries. No matter how fierce the imperialist anti-Soviet propaganda is, the independence of these three countries has not been affected. On the contrary, the economic relations between the Soviet Union and these three countries have greatly improved. (To be continued)

### Strengthening the Black Sea Blockade Issue: Britain, France, and Turkey Fail to Reach Agreement; Britain Denies Making Proposal

London. According to responsible sources in London, the rumor that Turkey has agreed to allow the Allied Powers' fleet to pass through the Tartar Strait to strengthen the Black Sea blockade is completely groundless, because the signatory countries of the Montreux Convention have agreed that in the war in which Turkey maintains neutrality, no country may send its warships through the strait. If Turkey is also one of the belligerent countries, it still has the right to decide whether to allow the warships of other countries to pass through. If Turkey feels that it is under immediate threat, it can make an exceptional decision.

### Japan Violates Gentlemen's Agreement, Arbitrarily Increases the Number of Candidates, Actually Increasing from Two to as Many as Five; Foreign Residents Express Extreme Surprise at This Conspiracy; The Future of the Public Concession is Truly Cause for Concealed Worry

Regarding the election of directors of the Public Works Department, the British and American candidates have already been selected. The British side has five candidates: Ke Zijiawei, Luotelike, Maidangna, Hailai, and Miqier, and Bao Qichi. The American side is A. Leman. The Chinese side has five candidates: Yu Qiaqing, Xi Yushu, Yuan Ludeng, Guo Shun, and Jiang Yiping, all seeking re-election. What is noteworthy is that the Japanese side has been slow to produce candidates, and their move to increase the number of directors has become more active. The Japanese side intends to break the "Five-Five-Two-Two" Gentlemen's Agreement that has been observed by the four countries of China, Britain, America, and Japan for many years. Furthermore, they intend to postpone the candidate election that the consul held on the 28th of last month for several days to complete all preparations. Until yesterday, the candidates had been selected, and their number reached as many as five. Therefore, the director election at the Western Taxpayers' Annual Meeting on April 17th will surely be a competition. The following are details of other situations:

Japanese Candidates Announced Yesterday

The Japanese candidates for the current Public Works Department director election were officially announced yesterday afternoon by Lin Xiongji, Chairman of the Japanese Residents' Election Committee. He stated that there are a total of five Japanese candidates for this election, namely: (1) Gao Xiongtailang (Manager of Mitsui Bussan Food Company in this city), (2) Gangben Yiyi (A well-known Japanese lawyer, working at Murakami Law Firm), (3) Gangben Yice (Former Japanese Consul in Seattle, recently a director of the Japanese Textile Industry Association in China), (4) Tian Cheng (Deputy Manager of the China Central Railway Company), (5) Kuroda Keitaro (Chairman of Shanghai Textile Co., Ltd.).

The Reasons Given are Also Very Forced

According to Mr. Lin Xiongji, "The number of Japanese taxpayers in the Public Concession has reached 3,000 (the total number of Japanese residents is said to be 70,000), while the number of British taxpayers is only 2,800. Therefore, it is a natural move for the number of Japanese candidates to increase from one to five. Moreover, the purpose of the Japanese side is to eliminate the monopoly of a certain nationality's directors in Shanghai over public undertakings. All undertakings in the Public Concession should be managed entirely according to the principles of public management," and so on.

British and American Residents Express Surprise

Taxpaying Chinese and British and American residents in this city expressed deep surprise yesterday upon hearing that the number of Japanese candidates had increased from two to five. They unanimously condemned this move by the Japanese as "shameless." A well-known British resident told reporters, "We thought the number of Japanese candidates would increase to four, but the number of five is really unexpected." As for why the Japanese suddenly increased the number of candidates to five, it is generally speculated that the Japanese are using a kind of psychology to try their luck. The Japanese anticipated that this request would be opposed by all parties, but they believed that achieving a small increase could achieve their purpose. Since they have already announced five candidates, an increase of three compared to the past, other nationalities' taxpayers, in addition to being surprised, cannot but make some concessions, especially if the Japanese increase by one or two. Observers paid close attention to the "dramatic" nature of the Japanese announcement of this news yesterday and believed that one should not lightly believe the Japanese's news of "there is no precedent" for this matter until the final moment. The British Residents' Election Committee told reporters yesterday that the committee will raise questions to the polling place about what is going on behind the scenes. This kind of election is of great importance. Although the number of British and Japanese taxpayers may be equal at present, British residents believe that there is a very large difference between the British and Japanese sides in terms of assets and rights, and the British side is naturally more than the Japanese side.

The Future of the Concession is Greatly Worrying

An official from the American Residents' Association stated yesterday, "The American Residents' Association will do its best to encourage American residents in Shanghai to participate in the voting for this election. They very much hope that taxpayers of other nationalities can also take unified action." The Chinese Taxpayers' Association believes that this move by the Japanese will still be difficult to win in this election, and it can be predicted that the five candidates put forward by the Japanese side will not be fully elected in this election. Another opinion of foreign residents is that if the Japanese can obtain an absolute majority in this election, the future of the concession is unthinkable. The so-called "Public Concession" will also become a "Japanese Concession," and they are all extremely worried about this matter.

The Japanese Plan to Use Jewish People

As for general predictions, it is believed that there are about 3,000 Japanese voters, 2,800 British voters, 600 American voters, 600 German and other national voters, and 8,000 Chinese voters. However, the number of Western voters totals 4,000, and the Japanese only have 3,000. It is difficult to believe that the Japanese can win in this election. Even the British side denied this statement yesterday, believing that the number of British taxpayers is not less than the Japanese, and at least can be balanced with the Japanese. However, according to another report, the Japanese will use other nationalities to vote in support of them, and are stepping up efforts in the area north of the Suzhou River. The Japanese are now trying to use the power of ordinary Jewish refugees as supporters of the Japanese candidates. However, another question is whether all the Japanese residents in Hongkou pay taxes to the Public Works Department, and whether their taxation is exactly the same as the way taxes are collected in the area north of the Suzhou River. This question is really difficult to give a definite answer to. The qualifications of Japanese taxpayers are the most important issue.

Mr. Fessenden Makes No Statement

In addition, according to Mr. Fessenden, Director-General of the Public Works Department, he does not want to express any opinions on this announcement by the Japanese. He believes that the election procedure will be carried out as usual, and this move by the Japanese will be difficult to change the original state in the past. According to the Spanish Consulate in Shanghai, as of now, more than 300 Spanish residents in Shanghai have been convened by the consulate. However, they are unwilling to announce which side they will support when voting.

Candidate List Deadline This Afternoon

The Public Works Department's 1940 director election is scheduled to be held on the 10th and 11th of this month. British and American representatives have been elected. The ballots must be delivered to the Director-General of the Public Works Department for verification and receipt before 12:00 noon today, otherwise they will be invalidated.

### The Fake "Central Market" Opens, Monopolization Implemented Today; The Puppet Regime Warns Vendors Not to Trade Privately; Villagers Are Unwilling to Be Exploited and Many Transport and Sell Secretly

The fake "Central Market" officially opened at 10:00 a.m. yesterday. The Public Concession Police Department authorities dispatched extra detectives to set up posts and guards in the surrounding area yesterday to prevent accidents. The British troops on the Tibet Road Bridge also suddenly increased their defenses. The fake "Central Market" was unable to operate yesterday because vegetable vendors had not received "entry and exit permits," and local goods merchants did not understand the trading methods. It is heard that official operations will begin today. Although the "branch market" on Bailinan Road in Shanghai West opened yesterday, it did not operate. The opening date of the "branch market" in Nanshi is uncertain. The details obtained are recorded as follows:

The Fake Market's Announcement Has Harsh Restrictions

After the establishment of the fake "market," the transportation of local goods to Shanghai from various places will be strictly controlled. However, it is still inevitable that ordinary villagers will transport and sell secretly. The Japanese puppets are suffering from the inability to deal with these people, so they posted an announcement in front of the "market" yesterday, warning general local goods vendors to sell all the local goods transported to Shanghai to the "market" and not to trade "privately," otherwise they will be "severely punished." The announcement also listed the local goods that "must not be traded privately" as: (1) Fresh Vegetables, (2) Poultry and Eggs, (3) Pickled and Cured Goods, (4) Salted and Dried Goods, etc. It can be seen from this that the Japanese puppets are in control down to the smallest detail. The number of local goods transported to Shanghai that were intercepted yesterday was not very large, estimated to be about 2,000 pieces. It is heard that the reason is that if all the local goods transported to Shanghai are intercepted suddenly, the general transporters will stop transporting to Shanghai, which would be counterproductive. Therefore, the Japanese puppets decided to adopt a gradual interception method and induce and threaten vendors to sell all local goods to the "market" in the future, and no longer sell them to other merchants.

The Nanshi Branch Market Cannot Open

In addition to the "Central Market" on North Tibet Road, the Japanese puppet agency for controlling local goods in this city also has two "branch markets" in Nanshi and Bailinan Road in Shanghai West. The above two places were originally scheduled to open simultaneously with the "Central Market" yesterday, but only one place on Bailinan Road opened yesterday, but did not operate. There is no news about the "branch market" in Nanshi. As for the reason, according to reliable sources, it is: (1) Local goods merchants in Nanshi refused to participate, (2) The French Concession's No. 16 Pier Iron Gate was not open. It is heard that the Japanese puppets believe that the Nanshi "branch market" can only be established after the No. 16 Pier Iron Gate is opened, so they are trying their best to request the French Concession authorities to open the iron gate. However, it is still questionable whether they can get their wish.

Extra British Troops Strengthen Defense

The fake "Central Market" opened at 10:00 a.m. yesterday. The Public Concession Police Department authorities dispatched four extra Chinese and Western detectives to set up posts and guards in front of the "market" yesterday to prevent accidents, and there was a police dog to prevent trouble. As for the sentry box in front of the gate, a British soldier with a gun stood guard as usual. However, in front of the British military fortress at the bridgehead on Tibet Road, in addition to a British soldier with a gun patrolling from time to time, more than ten new British soldiers have been added inside the fortress to strengthen the defense. As for the various intersections of the barbed wire at the boundary, the Chinese and British soldiers are guarding the posts as before without any increase. Inside the "market," plainclothes secret service agents of the Japanese puppets were densely deployed yesterday, and the security was very tight.

Various Exploitations Are Hated by Vegetable Vendors

Although the "market" opened at 10:00 a.m. yesterday, most of the local goods hawkers and merchants still did not understand the way it was controlled and "operated," so it did not "operate" yesterday. Only an announcement was posted, instructing vegetable vendors to go and purchase "entry and exit permits" and informing general local goods merchants of the procedures for participating in the "market." Yesterday, hundreds of ordinary vegetable vendors were forced to go to purchase "entry and exit permits" because the "market" controlled all local goods in Shanghai. The "permit" is valid for one year from yesterday to March 31 of next year, and must be purchased again after it expires. Ordinary vegetable vendors are all poor people, and they all hate the Japanese puppets' meticulous exploitation. Yesterday, some people even scolded the "market" administrators. As for the operating date of the "market," it has been set to begin today.

Foreign Ships Coming and Going on the Yangtze River

The Japanese flagship Izumo, after leaving Shanghai on March 26, has been moored in the harbor north of Nanjing with other Japanese warships. It is learned that it will leave Nanjing recently and come to Shanghai. The American Yangtze River patrol boat USS Grasshopper sailed to Wuhu yesterday. The Grasshopper left Wuhu in mid-last month and came to Shanghai.

### "New Regime" Postage Stamp Added, Occupied Areas Actually Follow Suit; However, Mail in the Concession Has Been Refused; The Outside World Is Dissatisfied with Tsae Pel-lin's Actions

The so-called Nanjing "new regime" postage stamp addition on mail by Shanghai Post Office Director Tsae Pel-lin has aroused great attention from the outside world. A correspondent from the Datong News Agency has recorded the details as follows:

Abruptly Followed Suit

According to a correspondent from the Datong News Agency, the Shanghai Post Office, from the 30th of last month, added a round rubber "postage stamp" with the words "Commemorating the Capital Return of the National Government of the Republic of China" on mail from Shanghai to the occupied areas. The "stamp" is about the size of a silver dollar, depicting the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum in the center, with the words "Shanghai" engraved below, and an Arabic date that can be changed.

Course of Coercion

The "postage stamp" was presented on the 25th of last month when a Japanese official from the Asia Development Board, accompanied by a so-called postal director, visited Shanghai Postmaster Tsae Pel-lin, and made two requests: 1. To hang "flags" on March 30; 2. To add a "postage stamp." However, Mr. Tsae refused outright the "flag" incident, as there was a similar request when another organization appeared in Nanjing the year before, but the post office had its own postal flag to hang.

Concession Refused

However, Mr. Tsae was unable to persist on the point of adding the so-called "Capital Return Commemorative Postage Stamp," and abruptly added it to mail sent to the occupied areas. Therefore, from the 30th of last month, in addition to the post offices in the two concessions refusing to comply, the Management Bureau and suburban post offices such as Hongkou and Nanjing quietly complied.

Postal Difficulties

A correspondent from the Datong News Agency visited a senior official of the Postal Administration yesterday morning. He expressed his regret that the Shanghai postal authorities abruptly accepted the above request, saying that Mr. Tsae's action may have been out of a desire to maintain the entire post office, so he did not hesitate to compromise on minor matters. However, in the view of knowledgeable people, this kind of protection is just a cover-up.

Nanshi Continues to Open

In order to prosper and "revive" its occupied areas, the Japanese first cancelled the pass system in Hongkou, Zhabei, and Yangshupu in early March. On the 25th of last month, the Nanshi District pass was also tentatively cancelled for a period of one week. On the expiration date of the 31st of last month, the Japanese side believed that there were no incidents within the boundary during the week of opening, and believed that the "results" were good. Therefore, after consultation with the Japanese Navy and Army stationed in Nanshi, it was decided to continue the opening from yesterday. However, suspicious citizens are still subject to inspection by the puppet police and "female inspectors." The purpose is nothing more than to induce Chinese people to return, in order to develop Nanshi's industry and commerce, and achieve their "prosperity" and "revival" dreams. However, according to inquiries from the Dakwang News Agency to the French Police Department detectives at various iron gates, the French authorities statistically counted the citizens entering and exiting every day after the iron gates were opened. Although the number of people entering and exiting was busier than before after the Japanese side cancelled the passes (an increase of about two-thirds), those coming to the Concession were still more than those entering Nanshi, approximately in a ratio of four to three. Therefore, the Japanese side's attempt has obviously been shattered.

### Standard Electric Clocks Should Be Installed in the French Concession; Citizens Feel Inconvenienced After the Large Striking Clock Was Removed

Recently, some citizens have suggested to the French Concession administrative authorities to select three locations on Avenue Joffre to install electric clocks to facilitate pedestrians to know the standard time. In major cities in France, there are such roadside clocks. It is reported that the French Concession authorities are considering it. In the Shanghai Concession, only the large clock at the Jianghai Customs is available for the public to use as a standard timepiece. However, if passersby want to know the correct time, they must go to the Bund to find out, which is very inconvenient. In the past, the French Municipal Council was located on Rue du Consulat (near the current Bank of China and the Mai Lan Police Station), and there was a large clock on the roof (the so-called large striking clock), which was sufficient to indicate the correct time to passersby. It lasted for 70 years before and after. Recently, this clock has been dismantled with the relocation of the French Municipal Council, which is regrettable.

### Public Works Department Western Staff Resign; The Retirement Pay Is Very Considerable; The Budget Increases Greatly Including Pension; This Year's Regulation is Over 5.8 Million; Many Department Staff Are Dissatisfied with Their Treatment and Seek to Leave

According to the English-language North China Daily Mail, the Public Works Department's budget for pensions and retirement pay has increased greatly, partly due to the resignation of many people from the Police Department and the layoffs in the Works Department. A total of nine people were laid off from the Works Department and completed their work on the 30th of last month. The budget for pensions and retirement pay in the last year was 1,604,93 yuan, but the actual expenditure was higher than the budget by one-fifth. This year's budget is 5,810,140 yuan, an increase of 4,205,210 yuan compared to last year. In recent months, many Public Works Department staff have resigned due to dissatisfaction with their treatment and low salaries. The Public Works Department must pay them retirement pay and travel expenses, and the total amount is quite considerable.

### Rice and Grain Industry Holds Joint Meeting to Discuss Production and Sales Cooperation; A Decision Was Made to Reply to the Public Works Department Within One Week; Another 50,000+ Bags of Foreign Rice Were Shipped

The Shanghai Soybean and Rice Industry Association, upon receiving a notice from the Public Works Department to organize a food production and sales cooperation organization, held a joint meeting of various groups at its meeting place at 15 Avenue Edward VII at 3:00 p.m. yesterday. More than 20 representatives from the Soybean and Rice Industry Association, the Rice Firm Industry Association, the Shanghai North Rice Merchants' United Benefit Association, the South Grain and Cereal Industry Association, and the Resale Industry Association attended. Xing Zhigang was the chairman.

Collecting Opinions

First, a representative reported that Mr. He Dequi of the Public Works Department convened a meeting last Wednesday, often concerned about the city's food supply. Therefore, after consulting the food production and sales cooperation proposal submitted by Jiang Yanfang, he believed that it was necessary to plan and proceed with the organization, in order to stabilize the city's food supply. Later, representatives attending the meeting expressed their opinions one after another, generally believing that the cooperation method was quite reasonable. However, the scope of the entire rice market in Shanghai is wider, and in addition to the groups attending this meeting, there are other rice industry groups and those closely related to the rice industry who have not attended. Therefore, the discussion of organizing rice and grain production and sales cooperation is regrettable for not being able to gather ideas from all parties. Moreover, the capital of the entire rice market is estimated to be 60 to 70 million yuan in national currency, which cannot be concentrated and organized at one time. The following resolutions were then discussed: "This matter is of great importance and cannot be decided by a small number of representatives. The original representatives should request a copy of the original proposal from the Public Works Department, distribute it to each group, convene their own meetings, and discuss and discuss it in the long term. The Soybean and Rice Industry Association should be notified by letter within one week, so as to collect opinions and reply to the Public Works Department."

Contributing Funds for Low-Priced Sales

A committee member also reported that the previous rice industry groups, including the sack industry, were enthusiastic about relief efforts, and the funds raised in the last session amounted to more than 20,000 yuan. In addition to the 100,000+ yuan that has already been paid to the Low-Priced Sales Committee to be used as donations for low-priced Saigon broken rice, it was also suggested that since the third phase of low-priced Saigon rice will end on the 7th of this month, ordinary poor people will lose this cheap rice and grain, which is not the intention of thorough relief. Therefore, the association can donate the remaining 100,000+ yuan as funding to continue holding low-priced sales, and call on the Civil Food Regulation Council and Mr. Yu Qiaqing to donate again to all walks of life to continue holding low-priced sales to benefit the poor until the new rice is on the market. At that time, it also received the support of all the attending committee members, and it was resolved that when continuing the low-priced sales, the association's deposits will be fully paid to the Low-Priced Sales Committee. In addition, at tomorrow's Public Works Department Price Stabilization Committee meeting, in addition to the rice industry group representatives Zhu Zixiang and others attending to report on the rice industry group's meeting situation, Jiang Yanfang, the proposer of the rice and grain production and sales cooperation, will also bring detailed measures on "production and sales cooperation" to attend the meeting.

Strict Investigation of the Rice Market

The city's rice grain reserves are abundant, and the rice supply is not short, but the rice price has fluctuated in recent days. According to the actual situation, sales on this street are not strong, and hoarders have successively sold off due to increased warehouse rent and tight money, and the rice price will not rise again. However, within a week, the price of rice per stone has risen by more than six yuan. The Market Management Committee, fearing that speculators would attempt to manipulate it again, sent the committees to the market with Public Works Department supervisors to monitor the industry's operations. Therefore, at the rice industry tea party market yesterday, the initial rise was very severe. Later, fearing the authorities' actions, the speculative wind stopped, and the rice price began to recover.

Foreign Rice Pours In

Yesterday, foreign ships transported 6,300 sea defense rice, and another 800 tons arrived at the same time. Today, another 20,000+ bags will be transported by the Pingtuo ship, which will dock at the Longmao Warehouse, and 22,120 bags will be transported by the Provost ship, which will dock at the Qichang Warehouse. Both ships were transported directly from Saigon.

### Japanese Troops in Xiashi Invade Haiyan, Confronting Guerrilla Troops Across the River; The Intention Is to Protect the Purchase of Silk and Tea

Haiyan has been stationed by Chinese guerrilla troops for a long time. On March 27, the Suzuki team of Japanese troops stationed in Xiashi suddenly moved towards Haiyan, and have already stationed there, and will be stationed in Yucheng, Shendang, and other places. These three places are all active areas for guerrilla troops, and are also important roads for the Chinese Jiangnan Army to cross the river to the north. Now they are all guarded by Japanese troops.

It is heard that the Japanese troops' move is intended to block the route of the Chinese guerrilla troops, especially in the economic aspect. The silk and tea will be on the market, and the Japanese are already using puppet "cooperatives" to buy tea, and are widely borrowing capital from traitors to buy silkworm cocoons. Therefore, many new orchid factories have been established. There are many new Japanese troops in Yuanhua who are training day and night.

Arresting Good People

Various abuses are inflicted. Xiashi has puppet "tax police teams" stationed in various cities and towns, so that Japanese troops can be extracted to fight against the Chinese guerrilla troops. Gambling dens are rampant in various cities and towns, and prostitution is prevalent. Good customs and discipline have all been destroyed to the fullest extent. The city of Xiashi is relatively prosperous, and Road Zhongli is no less of a scorched earth than Yuanhua.

The American Ship Delayed Arrival in Shanghai

The American President Lines' SS President Taft, after sailing from the United States to Japan this time, sailed directly to Hong Kong and Little Luzon. Now, on its return trip from Little Luzon, it is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai via Hong Kong. It was originally scheduled to arrive yesterday, but it is now known that it will be delayed by two days, and will enter the port at about 11:00 a.m. tomorrow (the 3rd), stopping at buoy 11.12. The first passenger tender will depart from the New Customs Wharf at 10:45 a.m. and return to the New Customs Wharf to land passengers at about 12:15 p.m. The large ship is scheduled to set sail from Shanghai at dawn on the 4th, heading to Japan via Honolulu, and returning to Los Angeles. The last passenger tender is scheduled to depart from the New Customs Wharf at 1:00 a.m. tomorrow (the 3rd) (i.e. morning of the 4th).

### Increased Donations for the Hotel Industry Will Be Implemented Soon; It Was Decided to Postpone the Payment Temporarily; Requesting a Reduction or a Revocation of the Order; The Public Works Department Still Has No Statement

The Shanghai Hotel Industry Association has repeatedly appealed to uphold justice regarding the Public Works Department's increase in business license donations for the industry from April 1, and has described the industry's current plight, requesting a reduction as an example or a revocation of the order. However, the Public Works Department has not made any statement on this request as of 6:00 p.m. yesterday. According to a report from the New Voice News Agency, the Hotel Industry Association, in addition to deeply hoping that the Bureau will review the matter, also decided to postpone the tax payment until a satisfactory reply is received from the Public Works Department, and has notified the industry members separately. It is heard that the Public Works Department will implement the increased donations for the industry.

### The Salvation Army Temporarily Suspends Sheltering Beggars; The Shelter Established in the French Concession Is Closed; Whether to Continue to Operate in the Future Requires an Order from Headquarters

According to the English-language North China Daily Mail, the Salvation Army's beggar shelter in the French Concession is scheduled to close tomorrow, and there is no action to establish a beggar shelter in the Public Concession. Therefore, there will be no beggar shelters in Shanghai. According to Salvation Army Commander Ma Ruishan, the Public Concession must have special funding to run a beggar shelter. This plan is still in its embryonic stage. As for the Salvation Army establishing a new shelter, no order has been received from the Salvation Army Headquarters in Peiping, so it cannot be determined at this time. However, the Salvation Army may take over a refugee shelter somewhere when it closes and convert it into a beggar shelter. There are only 130 beggars left in the French Concession beggar shelter, who will be released in the next two days. Fifty of them are young beggars, who will be sent to the Dunxin Road Refugee Shelter. In the past 16 months, the French Concession Police Department has detained more than 8,000 beggars to the Salvation Army shelter.

### Property Owners in Refugee Areas Should Fulfill Obligations

Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, Father Jacquinot de Bessenay of French nationality, out of concern for the safety of residents in the Nanshi area, spared no effort to appeal to both the Chinese and Japanese sides, and finally established the Nanshi Refugee Zone, allowing tens of thousands of compatriots to settle down. His great achievements have been praised by all sectors of society. It is now learned that after the opening of Nanshi, more than a dozen landlords of the shelters in the area have demanded the refugees to move out, intending to lease the properties for huge profits, disregarding the displaced refugees. The reporter from the agency believes that this matter has a significant impact, so they inquired with the person in charge of the area about the handling measures. It is understood that Father Jacquinot de Bessenay, after receiving the eviction letters from the landlords, had already instructed the office yesterday to reply to each of them based on the actual situation. The reply letter is recorded as follows: "To the respondents, we have just received your letter stating that you request the removal of the refugee shelter, etc. The case has been submitted to Mr. Jacquinot de Bessenay, Standing Committee Member of the Supervisory Committee, for clarification. The preservation of half of Nanshi's urban area during the Sino-Japanese War is entirely due to the agreement between the Chinese and Japanese governments to designate a portion of Nanshi as a refugee area for the purpose of sheltering refugees. Chinese homeowners should share accommodations with Chinese disaster victims to demonstrate their due obligations. However, the request for eviction is currently difficult to comply with."

### Bloody Incident on Avenue Foch Yesterday Morning: Song Xiquan Shot Dead; Song Worked at a Club Before His Death; Police Investigating the Cause of the Murder

At approximately 8:30 AM yesterday morning, a shooting occurred at No. 46, Duofu Lane, 504 Avenue Foch. The victim was Song Xiquan from Shaoxing, who worked in a certain place. He was shot in the head and torso, both in vital areas, and died instantly. The shooter fled the scene. The details are as follows:

Residing with a Concubine

Song Xiquan, who served in a club in western Shanghai, was over forty years old and from Shaoxing. He lived in the eastern厢 room upstairs at No. 46, Duofu Lane, 504 Avenue Foch. He had a wife and a concubine. His legal wife lived separately at No. 5 Avenue Mandellane, while his beloved concubine, Caiqiu, lived at the Duofu Lane residence. He loved her dearly, so Song often ate and slept there, considering it his comfortable nest, and he was content and did not miss his other home. He usually wore Western suits and used a car for transportation, living quite lavishly.

Strange Guests Bringing Gifts

At approximately 8:30 AM yesterday morning, two strange guests suddenly arrived, carrying four bottles of beer and a male goose, appearing to be delivering gifts. They knocked on the door several times. The concubine's sister opened the door and invited them into the living room. The strange guests falsely claimed that the gifts were for Mr. Song and requested to meet with Mr. Song to discuss something in person.

Two Shots Fired Suddenly

At that time, Song was still sound asleep. Awakened by his sister-in-law, he drowsily, without changing from his nightclothes, got out of bed and opened the door. He caught sight of the two men closely following his sister-in-law, and he did not recognize any of them. Just as he was about to ask, before he could finish speaking, one of the men behind him pulled out a gun and fired two shots. Both hit vital areas, one shot hitting below the right eye in the head, and the other penetrating the left waist and ribs. He immediately fell to the ground, barely breathing.

Died from Severe Injuries

Seeing that their target had been hit, the shooter abandoned the gifts, went downstairs, and fled without a trace. At this time, Song's concubine witnessed the tragic scene, and after being terrified, she began to cry loudly. Her sister reported the incident to the Chengdu Road Police Station. By the time the Chinese and Western detectives arrived to investigate, the shooter had already disappeared. Only two cartridge casings were recovered and taken back to the police station for investigation along with the gifts.

### Lawyer Hua's Clerk Extorted Due to Unemployment, Sentenced to Six Months, Suspended for Two Years

Bu Shouleng, a Shanghai native who used to work as a typist at the law firm of French lawyer Piran Maitre, was dismissed for embezzling rent from the agency. He had been unemployed for over a year. The day before yesterday, at 11:00 AM, when Piran Maitre sent his clerk to the Citibank on the Bund to withdraw money, Bu learned of this and had an idea. He carried a bag of lime powder and a bottle of corrosive liquid and went to wait on the Bund Beijing Road. He stopped the clerk Wu Yunzhang and demanded that he hand over the withdrawn money, threatening to throw corrosive liquid and lime powder at him if he refused. Wu reported him to the police, and he was arrested. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Special Court's First Criminal Division and prosecuted for attempted extortion. Judge Feng Shide presided over the hearing. The witness Wu Yunzhang testified that the defendant was his colleague a year ago, and he had not suffered any losses, asking the judge not to punish the defendant. However, he needed to report the facts: when he returned with the $1,500, the defendant met him on the road and asked him to remember their past friendship and help him out by handing over the money without making a fuss, saying that if he were to call the police, he should wait until he had fled far away. Otherwise, he would be arrested and threatened to blind him with lime powder if he did not agree. Feeling scared, he tricked him into returning to the bank to hand over the money. When he walked into the bank, he immediately called the police and had him arrested. The court verified the testimony and questioned the defendant Bu Shouleng, who admitted that he was driven to take risks due to economic hardship. Judge Feng ruled that Bu Shouleng was guilty of attempted extortion and sentenced him to six months of imprisonment, suspended for two years.

### Carpenter Repays Debt; Threatening to Make Trouble; Zhu Linao Arrested Awaiting Sentence

Zhu Linao, a carpenter, borrowed fifty yuan from Sun Dali, the owner of Sun Fengji Carpentry Shop at No. 37, Lane 498, Huade Road, in November of last year. Because he repeatedly failed to repay the debt, Zhu mortgaged two wooden boxes to Sun. Later, Zhu learned that Sun had sold the wooden boxes for seventy yuan, so he negotiated with Sun. Failing to reach an agreement, on March 26, Zhu forced Sun to the Wanbin Tea House at the intersection of Huade Road and Liaoyang Road and demanded two hundred yuan, but failed. Sun was subjected to violent means, with his hands tied behind his back, and sent to the Japanese Headquarters on Liaoyang Road, where he was accused of stealing the wooden boxes, severely beaten, and forced to sign a note promising to return the money within two days before being released. After this terrifying experience, Sun Dali kept a low profile. Until February 30, a Westerner from the Municipal Council's Donations Office went to Sun's house to collect donations, which he refused to pay, arguing that since he paid donations, he should be protected, but the opposite was true, so he had no obligation to pay donations. After the Westerner learned of the situation, he took Sun to the Yulin Road Police Station to report the incident. Unexpectedly, two military police from the Japanese Headquarters went to Sun's house, ordering him to fulfill the note. Sun's wife telegraphed the police station, who sent Chinese, Western, and Japanese detectives to investigate. The military police had already left, so Zhu Linao was arrested and taken to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Special Court's First Criminal Division. The police lawyer Zhang Tianyin prosecuted according to the law, and Sun Dali testified about the situation at the time. When questioned, the defendant's statement was evasive. The presiding judge ordered him to be detained pending sentencing.

### Zhu Zuotong Arrested Last Night

At 11:30 last night, Zhu Zuotong, manager of the China-America Evening News, went to the Huile Palace at No. 42 Da Xi Road in western Shanghai at the invitation of a friend, Chuan Mou. Just as they were talking, two or three inspectors from the palace came forward and asked Zhu Zuotong and three bodyguards recently hired by Zhu to come outside, saying that someone outside wanted to talk to Mr. Zhu. Hearing this, Zhu got up and went out, followed by Chuan and the bodyguards. Upon reaching the outside, five or six strong men came forward and asked who was Zhu Zuotong. Zhu answered, "That's me." One of the five or six men immediately pulled out handcuffs, and without asking why, handcuffed his hands and used a gun to force the three of them into a car parked there, and drove away at full speed. Zhu Zuotong's own car was also driven away.

### Letter to the Editor

Dear Editor, According to Ms. Yin Junong, your newspaper published a news item on the 30th of this month about a woman, Yin Junong, accusing her husband of adultery, which is quite inconsistent with the facts. Since she married Chen Zonghui (Yuanliang), the second son of antique dealer Chen Weiquan, through a matchmaker, Feng, Zonghui has been dissolute, unproductive, and has had extramarital affairs. After being advised, he responded with abusive words and even beat her. Her in-laws were also unsympathetic, and she could not bear the abuse, so she returned to her mother's house to live temporarily. It has been five years now. How can it be said that she lingers outside and does not listen to Zonghui's advice, leading to discord? Furthermore, after she married Zonghui, she gave birth to two daughters. Not only did Zonghui not pay for the cost of childbirth, but he also did not care about their subsequent lives. Her alimony is even more out of the question. Is it her failure to abide by the way of a woman, or Zonghui's unkindness? There is no need to elaborate. Recently, after she asked Zonghui to return the advances and other funds, he sent a letter saying that he had rented another house and asked her to live with him, which was instigated by her father-in-law to deliberately pretend to be separated in order to avoid the obligation to support her. Zonghui has been living with the Xianle dance girl for more than a day. Later, after learning of his address, she reported it to the French police, who arrested him at about 5:00 AM. The detectives knocked on the door and entered the room. Zonghui hurriedly fled barefoot to the bathroom. Zonghui's bathrobe and obscene objects were found on Ju Lianfang's bed. Zonghui's shoes were also placed in front of the bed. The bathroom where he claimed to be sleeping only had a military bed, without Zonghui's clothes or men's shoes and socks. Therefore, the police immediately prosecuted him for obstructing family harmony under the criminal law. After Judge Li of the Eighth Criminal Division interrogated him, he ordered Chen Zonghui and Zhou Lianfang to post bail and rescheduled the hearing for 9:00 AM on April 5. The facts are all there, and there is no room for sophistry. Fearing that the outside world will not understand the truth and spread misinformation, we entrust you to convey the correction. Yours sincerely, Wu Youyuan, Lawyer, April 1, 29th year of the Republic of China.

### Small Gambling Dens in Western Shanghai Closed; Large Gambling Dens Still Exist; Prolonging Life by Spending Movement Fees; Huahui Grand Factories Also Temporarily Suspended

The Japanese Military Police Department had stipulated that all gambling dens in western Shanghai should be closed by the end of February of the lunar year. Later, the owners of various gambling dens asked influential people to intercede with the Japanese side, citing the need to maintain the livelihoods of employees, and were allowed to postpone it for one month. The final deadline was the day before yesterday (March 31). The Japanese Military Police Department immediately sent personnel to notify the various gambling dens to implement the order. The owners of various gambling dens then convened a temporary meeting at a certain place. After some discussion, they once again obtained

Japanese Agreement

From April 1, more than ten smaller gambling dens will be closed first. The remaining ones, such as Qiulan, Yuyuan, Zhaofeng, Yilu, Huile Palace, Xilaimen, Monte Carlo, Kaixile, Victoria, Dasheng, Lao Rongsheng, Fusheng, and more than ten others, interceded with a certain party and spent a large amount of movement fees, so they were allowed to prolong their life.

Temporarily Exist

However, it is also necessary to limit them to within two years, and gradually eliminate them by means of lottery. The Hollywood, Paradise, and Songyuan Gambling Den at No. 626 Haig Road, which are of great scale, are ordered to completely reorganize within two months, only allowing them to be changed to the nature of a club general meeting, and not allowing open gambling. Since yesterday, more than ten small gambling dens such as Xiangsheng, Shenji, and Daxing in western Shanghai have all been closed. The various gambling dens have jointly organized a post-employment committee to handle the resettlement of

Gambling Den Employees

In addition, Huahui listening tube agencies and other agencies have also been completely suspended since yesterday. Also, it is reported that the Asian General Meeting Gambling Den at No. 65 Gordon Road has also announced its closure since yesterday (April 1). All employees have been dismissed. The scale of the gambling den can be said to be the best in Shanghai, with hundreds of thousands of people entering and leaving every day. The person in charge is a Cantonese man named Liang, who has now returned to Hong Kong fully loaded.

Huahui Agencies Also Suspended

Since the fall of Shanghai, the Japanese puppet regime, due to insufficient economic sources, has resorted to all kinds of extortion. In various places such as western Shanghai, Nanshi, Zhabei, Hongkou, and Pudong, they have allowed the establishment of gambling dens and huahui, openly selling opium and collecting huge amounts of harsh taxes, so that the various areas have become smoky and miasmic, becoming a source of evil. Although many parties have pointed out the sales, the Japanese puppet regime has ignored them. Now, with the imminent implementation of the temporary agreement on cross-border road construction and police affairs between the Municipal Council and the puppet "Municipal Government," the Japanese side, in addition to closing some of the gambling dens yesterday, has also closed the Huahui general factories, grand factories, branch factories, and Huahui listening tube branches, such as Yiji, Deji, etc., in western Shanghai. However, the districts of Nanshi, Hongkou, Zhabei, and Pudong still exist, harming society. It is unknown when they will be cleared.

### Sharing Strange Articles

Last year, during the Hangzhou children's examination, the second question was: "While Qi has its territory, chickens crow." Yesterday, I met a friend from Hangzhou who said that in a child's paper, after the second comparison, reading it made one stick out one's tongue! The text said: "Suppose there are chickens that are yellow, and chickens that are white, and chickens that are either yellow or white; although the colors of the chickens are different, their crowing is the same. Now, the chickens of the neighbors are robbed every day, which is a constant occurrence for the people of Qi. Is the crowing of these chickens the crowing of chickens robbed from the neighbors? Or is it the crowing of chickens raised by their own family?" Reading it, one feels that it truly deserves the four words "fantastic imagination." But unexpectedly, its comparison is even more extraordinary. The text said: "Let us not discuss whether they are female chickens or male chickens, and let us not discuss whether they are chickens that neither sleep nor are male; although the chickens are different, their crowing is the same. Crowing like a chicken is a skill of many Qi visitors, so is the crowing of these chickens the crowing of Qi people imitating it? Or is it the crowing of many who regard each other as crowing? One imagination is bizarre, and one feels that there has never been such a thing. Some say that the two comparisons, the writing is smooth and logical, linking the upper and lower sections, with everything being thorough, is merely the game of a scholar."

Dog Burial Village

The loyalty and treachery of people will be judged by later generations. When Yue Wu Mu was framed by Qin Gui, imprisoned, and suffered all kinds of torture, the power of the traitor was at its peak. By the time later, those who mourned at Yue Wang's tomb rubbed shoulders, and the West Lake became much more beautiful because of this. Qin Gui was spat upon by the world for all eternity. Outside Wulin Gate in Hangzhou Province, dozens of miles from the city, there is a village. According to legend, it was the secluded residence of the traitor Qin Gui. Later generations hated it and named the village Dog Burial Village.

### Finance: US Dollar Appreciation, Once Approaching the 6 Yuan Mark, Soon Slightly Returning to Level, HSBC Maintains Sterling

The foreign exchange market yesterday saw no change in HSBC's listed rates. The unofficial market for sterling and the US dollar was relatively tense due to the relationship between Monday and the beginning of the month, and the trend was rebounding, especially for futures, resembling the beginning of last week. The morning opening was due to the increase in sterling-US dollar exchange rates, leading to a decrease of 0.015625 in sterling, to 4 pence and 1/8, while the US dollar was level, at 6.0625 yuan. Soon, speculators took the lead, followed by Hong Kong dealers, and the activity of Japanese firms became more significant. For a time, buying exceeded selling, and the market showed signs of softening. Sterling remained unchanged, while the US dollar reached 6 yuan, and the futures price was particularly tight. By the close of trading, as demand eased slightly, it loosened slightly. The US dollar was 6.03125 yuan. In the early afternoon, it remained stable, but before long, speculators re-emerged, pushing the US dollar towards settlement, once reducing it to 5.96875 yuan (breaking the tight price of 6 yuan on the 27th of last month), but only for a very short time. Fortunately, HSBC made every effort to supply advance orders, about 100,000 pounds or so throughout the day, so the sterling price of 4 pence and 1/8 remained unchanged until the evening close. The US dollar was re-quoted at 6 yuan, resulting in a tightening of 0.015625 and 0.0625 compared to the previous day. The underlying trend of futures and spot were both seen to diverge.

Hong Kong Dealers Settled First, Followed by Japanese Firms

In the early morning, overseas exchange rates for sterling against the US dollar, Shanghai, and France were level. The US dollar rose 0.0625 against sterling, 0.125 against France, and 5 cents against Shanghai. The central government's listed rates for various currencies remained unchanged. The bank's opening selling price for spot was 4 pence and 1/8 for sterling and 6.0625 yuan for the US dollar. Compared to the end of last week, sterling was tight by 0.015625, while the US dollar was neither up nor down, due to a slight increase in exchange rates. After the opening, foreign firms were quite eager to sell, but at that time there were few speculators, so the market was slightly firmer in a quiet manner. It is estimated that foreign firms sold this month's US dollar at 5.9375 yuan to speculators, while spot US dollars were also quoted at 6.09375 yuan. HSBC's listed rates were announced and remained unchanged. The white silver balance tax was also announced and did not rise or fall. After that, a certain bank slightly took a position, and it returned to level. At 10 o'clock, Hong Kong telegrams suddenly entered the market, speculators followed suit, and Japanese firms also became active, so the market suddenly became tight and soft. It is estimated that Hong Kong telegrams entered the spot US dollar at 6.03125 yuan, and May US dollars at 5.75 yuan, and speculators settled April US dollars at 5.90625 and 0.875 yuan, May US dollars at 5.75 and 0.6875 yuan. Later, Chinese merchants entered the spot US dollar again at 6 yuan. At that time, spot sterling was still stable, firmly standing at 4 pence and 1/8, while futures slightly followed the decrease, with April only at 4 pence and 0.03125, and May only at 3 pence and 0.9375. At noon, speculators gradually decreased, and the spot US dollar slightly returned to firmness. Until the noon close, it was 6.03125 yuan, with sterling still at 4 pence and 1/8, tighter by 0.03125 compared to the morning opening for sterling and US dollar.

The Underlying Trends of Futures and Spot are Both Seen to Diverge

The after-market opening was stable, still at 4 pence and 1/8, and 6.03125 yuan. After a short while, as speculators continued to enter the market, the market trended downward again. It is estimated that overseas Chinese entered April sterling at 4 pence and 0.015625, and also absorbed the spot US dollar at 6 yuan from Chase and other firms. Later, they purchased April US dollars at 5.8125 yuan from a certain bank. At that time, the spot US dollar was surprisingly quoted as high as 5.96875 yuan, and April sterling was also quoted as low as 4 pence. After entering, speculators were slightly lacking, and the situation gradually stabilized. Extending to the close, the US dollar returned to firmness, reaching 6 yuan, while sterling remained at 4 pence and 1/8. April sterling was 4 pence and 0.015625, the US dollar was 5.84375 yuan, May sterling was 3 pence and 0.921875, and the US dollar was 5.65625 yuan.

### Buyers Like Crazy, Gold Prices Soar Uncontrollably, Approaching 5,600 Yuan

Yesterday, the spot market for cash smelting saw an initial weakness in the morning, but reversed and surged later, with the momentum gradually intensifying, creating a new historical record for gold prices. This was because the exchange rate market was tightening, and people were all buying gold as the only way to profit. Although chips were occasionally released on the market, they were immediately absorbed. At that time, the lowest price was 5,380 yuan. Afterwards, banks and cash dealers bought in, while securities dealers and money changers had mixed sales, so it hovered around 5,400 yuan for a long time. After 10:45, as the foreign exchange rate declined, securities dealers and a certain Japanese bank secretly bought heavily, and money changers and others absorbed it fiercely, so the price rose sharply and was difficult to stop. The afternoon surge was particularly dramatic, reaching an unprecedented high price of 5,590 yuan (breaking the peak of 5,450 yuan on the 27th of last month). However, as the foreign exchange rate returned to firmness, the buying momentum gradually dissipated, and it slightly declined, with the closing result still at 5,555 yuan, an increase of 145 yuan compared to the noon close of the previous weekend. The whole day's transactions went from clear to prosperous, about four thousand several hundred taels. Jewelry from Yubu Gao increased by 15 yuan, also creating a shocking record of 560 yuan. Customs gold, etc., remained level.

The Whole Day Soared by Over a Hundred Yuan

Since the morning opening, with the foreign exchange rate reported level and people's sentiment turning weak, sellers gathered from all directions. The opening fell by 30 yuan, with banks offering cash dealers ten taels for 5,380 yuan. Afterwards, some banks took the opportunity to aggressively buy in, and cash dealers and a few retail investors also searched for it, although securities dealers and money changers sold out, it was still felt to be insufficient, so it gradually rose by 37 yuan. A bank entered 30 taels for securities dealers, for 5,417 yuan. After that, the foreign exchange rate was stable and slightly firm, and securities dealers and others continued to sell out, and banks released profits, and then fell slightly by 35 yuan. Jin Hao released 50 taels to money changers, for 5,382 yuan. Immediately afterwards, a certain securities dealer suddenly turned from selling to buying, and the foreign exchange rate was reported to be soft, and the market trend was firm. At around 11:00, it broke the 5,400 yuan mark again. Afterwards, as the foreign exchange rate continued to be tight, people's sentiment was particularly strong, and banks, money changers, and securities dealers scrambled to absorb it fiercely, and retail short sellers made up for their positions, and dozens of yuan were raised again. Jin Hao entered 30 taels for banks, for 5,465 yuan. At noon, the US dollar was slightly level, and banks and retail longs took advantage of the high price to close out, and then returned to a small 20 yuan. Banks traded 20 taels with each other, for 5,445 yuan, as the noon closing price. The after-market potential was particularly strong, and the opening jumped up 55 yuan. Jin Hao entered 20 taels for banks, for 5,500 yuan. Afterwards, the foreign exchange market was still reported to be tightening, and a certain money changer and a certain securities dealer competed to buy aggressively. Soon, it jumped another 90 yuan. Securities dealers entered 30 taels for money changers, for 5,590 yuan. However, a certain money changer suddenly came out again, and retail longs also sold out, so it fell back by 55 yuan. Jin Hao released 20 taels to money changers, for 5,590 yuan. Taking into account that a certain money changer came to search for it again, and Jin Hao also bought, it was raised another 50 yuan. Jin Hao entered 40 taels for banks, for 5,585 yuan. After entering, securities dealers took advantage of the high price to release it again, and at the same time, banks issued floating longs, and it returned to a small 30 yuan. Jin Hao released 20 taels to banks, for 5,555 yuan, as the evening closing price. As a result, compared to the weekend noon closing, it rose by 145 yuan, and the whole day fluctuated by 210 yuan. The selling price of cash dealers' own brand gold was higher than smelting, and the purchase price was reduced by 20 yuan, and the current bid gold was lower than the listed gold by more than 50 yuan, and none were made.

Jewelry at 560 Yuan

The exchange rate for gold jewelry per tael was initially still 545 yuan at Datong Bank. At 11:20, it was increased by 5 yuan. At 2:10 in the afternoon, it was increased by 5 yuan again. At 2:15, it was increased by 5 yuan again. As a result, it was a total of 15 yuan higher. Datong Bank changed its suspension to 560 yuan, and the new bank had the same price as the above price. The above all created unprecedented high prices since the market was established. The purchase price was reduced by about 15 yuan.

### Foreign Currencies Rise Frequently

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw a continued demand for sterling and US dollars, and market prices continued to rise. This was because black market gold appeared at new high prices. The supply and demand for sterling notes was still balanced, but the underlying trend was still firm. US dollar notes were still fluctuating and unstable, initially falling to 16.3 yuan, and then trending towards firmness. In the afternoon, the US dollar broke through the 6 yuan mark, so it once rose to 16.62 yuan, which was 2 cents higher than the previous highest price. After that, due to profit-taking, the evening market slightly declined to 16.52 yuan. Hong Kong notes trended firmly along with the Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange rate. The demand for French franc notes was not weak. There was strong demand for Singapore, Dutch, Canadian, and Philippine notes. The rebound in Japanese gold notes was still strong, and the evening market was 1.294 yuan. The demand for Korean notes was increasingly strong, and the evening market was 1.02 yuan. Yesterday's market prices saw the largest increase in sterling and US dollars, each rising by 3 yuan, followed by the increase of 20 cents in Dutch notes. Sterling notes, US dollar notes, Singapore, Canadian, and Philippine notes all rose by 10 cents, Hong Kong notes rose by 1 cent, French franc notes rose by 2 cents, and the rest remained unchanged.

### Discount Rate Rises Step by Step, Resulting in Another Increase of Two Yuan, Interbank Lending Rate Also Rises by One Cent

Yesterday's discount rate for bank drafts and bills first rose and then fell. In the morning, it once flew up to 69 yuan per thousand yuan, but soon fell back to 67 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, it retreated to 66 yuan, which was 2 yuan higher than the previous Saturday. The interbank lending rate of the Money Industry Association rose by one cent, and both the morning and afternoon markets were listed at 19 cents.

### Securities: Domestic Debt Itself Has Its True Value, How Can It Be Different Because of Empty Words?

The unofficial securities market yesterday trended upwards again. People's sentiment was excited due to the depletion of chips, and the environment was quite stable. Rumors and news were beneficial to various bonds. In fact, how could domestic debt itself be increased or decreased by empty words? Unexpectedly, the price rose again. Although the foreign exchange rate was at a new low and gold was at a new high, the proportion of market prices to the market has changed, and it seems to have broken away from the previous practice of gold prices rising and government bonds falling. There is no shortage of longs in the market, because if only one is monopolized, the rest must rise with it. The trend is feared to be unpredictable by ordinary eyes. Yesterday's transactions saw more retail transactions in the morning, but more were entering than exiting, and the market was slightly firm. In the afternoon, the 20th continued to search for Type E bonds, and Hengkang also bought a lot of Type E bonds. For a time, the chips suddenly felt lacking, so it broke through the 9 yuan mark again, and the rest also unanimously improved. As a result, it improved by 1 to 3 cents, with a turnover of about 800,000 yuan. The 96, which had not been opened for a long time, also had 20,000 yuan in turnover. A simple table is listed below. The 96 is compared to the market on January 16th.

Stock transactions: 50 shares of Bank of China were traded at a price of 71.5 yuan.

In the general stock market, due to tight credit, more sellers emerged. Several stocks were able to resist this pressure at one point, such as Jardine Matheson, China Land Reclamation, International, and Shanghai Banking Corporation, among others. However, near the close, they also succumbed, and the closing price was the lowest of the day. Rubber stocks, regardless of the tight exchange rate market and the upcoming announcement of dividends by several rubber companies, were also affected equally and fell.

### Yarn and Cotton: Hong Kong Dealers Procure Spot Yarn, Double Horse Rises Another 35 Yuan

The yarn market continued to rise, and the rise was violent. This was because demand in the south was picking up, and Hong Kong dealers were coming one after another. Therefore, people's sentiment was unusually enthusiastic, and the market rose straight into the clouds. This kind of rise is inevitably too much, and the reaction in the future should also be guarded against. However, spot sales are good.

At the morning opening of the yarn market, it was heard that the foreign exchange rate was slightly higher, the gold price was level, and people's sentiment was still calm. The opening price of 20-count Double Horse yarn for April was 1,070 yuan, slightly falling to 1,065 yuan. Later, it was heard that Guangdong dealers were actively trading spot goods, so the market rose step by step, and people's sentiment was even stronger. Buyers flocked in. 20-count Double Horse yarn for April rose straight to 1,094 yuan. A mid-day transaction statistics checked 3,700 bales, and the market for 20-count Double Horse spot rose by 35 yuan. Also checked cotton yarn exports: 212 pieces were shipped to Wenzhou, and 75 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong. The amount purchased by each dealer is listed below:

Hong Kong 1,650 Mainland 25

Fellow Dealers 1,800 Total 3,700

Local cotton transactions were still mediocre, but foreign cotton transactions were still not bad. However, the market was unusually ordinary. This was because Indian cotton prices were very weak, and various firms ordered a lot. Recently, Indian and American cotton have been coming in continuously, so local cotton has been suppressed by it. Although yarn prices are rising sharply, the cotton market has been depressed. The current cotton situation is as follows:

Tong Da Bale 212.00 Fellow Dealers entered 107 pieces

Also 214.00 Also 105 pieces

Omla 212.00 Also 205 pieces

Bailu Qu 213.00 Also 500 pieces

Pingguo Er 178.00 119.00 Also 379 pieces

Bailu Qu 220.00 Shenxin 5 pieces

Pingguo Er 182.00 Also 3 pieces

Xia Sha Hua 220.00 Also 2 pieces

Tongzhou Hua 207.00 Fellow Dealers entered 200 bales

Tong Da Bale 213.50 Also 100 bales

Additional news: foreign cotton market prices, the New York cotton market, rose in the morning opening due to speculative buying. Later, due to buying by fellow dealers and some short covering, the closing price was higher than the previous day by five or six pounds. India fell five rupees or more, including predictions. Egypt rose three to five pounds.

Shanghai foreign cotton transactions: yesterday, due to the start of the Guangdong dealers' spring sales of cotton yarn, spot yarn transactions were active, and raw cotton transactions were also triggered by small transactions. Indian cotton spot goods in the hands of fellow dealers in the market were unexpectedly bought up. All parties' intentions were also high for raw cotton selling prices. The raw cotton prices with the US dollar at 6 yuan converted to delivered prices are as follows:

20 Count American Met Lin 289.60

20 Count Also Lower Grade 278.90

32 Count Also 305.65

32 Count Also Lower Grade 294.75

42 Count Also 307.20

42 Count Also Lower Grade 297.00

### Oil Market: Raw Soybean Oil Stagnant Sales, Opening Prices All Fell by Four or Five Yuan

Raw Oil: Yesterday, the actual sales were not strong, and the accumulation of oil on the market was abundant, so the market price gradually decreased. It has fallen by 12 or 13 yuan compared to the highest peak of last month. The trend in the early morning was still slightly decreasing. In the afternoon, a large number of longs sought to sell out urgently, resulting in greater volatility. The market prices fell sharply again and again. As a result, peanut oil fell by five yuan, and 200 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil were traded at a price of 70 yuan. 3,000 cans of Yantai canned raw oil were traded at a price of 91 yuan. 60 barrels of Qingdao barrel raw oil were traded at a price of 100 yuan. Checked its source, 6,125 cans came from Yantai yesterday, and today 3,690 cans are shipped to Hong Kong.

Soybean Oil: Yesterday, the opening price of soybean oil also fell sharply by 3.5 yuan. 300 pieces of Jiaozhou soybean oil were traded at a price of 70 yuan. 100 dan of local factory soybean oil were traded at a price of 78 yuan. 40 barrels of Qingdao barrel soybean oil were traded at a price of 104 yuan. 90 barrels of Dalian crude oil were traded at a price from 106.5 yuan, falling step by step to 104.5 yuan. Checked the source, 157 pieces came from Yantai yesterday.

### Piece Goods: Gold Rising, Cotton Cloth Prices Rise Aggressively, Market Demand Exceeds Supply, New Prices Set for Colored Cloth

Domestic Cloth: Yesterday's market rose, and the situation was aggressive. At the morning opening, Yih Ho coarse cloth rose by 2.5 to 5 cents per piece, and Lun Chang floral cloth rose by 2.5 cents. Various factory fine cloths and fine twills rose by 2.5 cents. Bleached and dyed cloths rose by 5 cents. In the afternoon, with gold rising sharply, fellow dealers and Guangdong dealers' intentions were stronger, and there were few suppliers. Most temporarily adopted a wait-and-see attitude. The market price continued to rise by 2 or 3 cents per piece. Various factory colored cloths are expected to set another price. In the afternoon, most had no market. The most active transactions were on this street. More than 500 pieces of fine cloth and fine twill greige goods were traded. Guangdong dealers bought more than 200 pieces of blue cloth, colored twill, bleached cloth, and fuji silk. Ningwu dealers bought nearly 300 pieces of group cloth, bleached and dyed cloth. Ningwu dealers bought several thousand pieces of colored cloth, bleached cloth, coarse cloth, and printed cloth. Hong Kong dealers bought 50 to 60 packages of fine cloth, coarse twill, and fine twill.

Eastern Cloth: The rise is violent. White fine cloth continues to rise by one yuan per piece, fine twill rises by 5 to 7.5 cents per piece, and serge rises by more than one cent per yard. Dealers from Beilu, Tianjin, Yantai, Qinhuangdao, etc. bought more than 1,500 pieces of fine cloth for the current month's delivery. This street also bought 1,500 to 1,600 pieces of fine cloth and fine twill, but mostly spot goods. Longtou fine cloth opened at 32 yuan for the current month's delivery, and 32.75 yuan for the next month's delivery. Four Gentlemen serge is rising now, with a quoted price of 93 cents per yard, and 96 cents for the next month.

### Sugar Market: Diaoqing Production Price Reported Tight

According to yesterday's telegram from Holland, the price of Group White sugar was slightly angled, with the C.I.F.K.G. example at 8.80 guilders. The public society market was stable. The spot price of 24 Group White sugar was 63 yuan at the local warehouse, 62.8 yuan for new goods at the outer warehouse, and 7 cents for old goods, and 49 yuan for re-exports, with no major changes. Taikoo Cart White slightly rose.

### Silk and Tea: Raw Silk Plummets in Price, Local Silk Transactions Show No Development

Yokohama silk prices uniformly declined yesterday. Spot price was 1580 yuan, near-term 1576 yuan, and far-term 1571 yuan. Compared with last Saturday, the decline ranged from 25 to 42 yuan. At the close of the afternoon session, the market remained sluggish, with spot at 1575 yuan, down 5 yuan; near-term at 1560 yuan, down 6 yuan; and far-term at 1552 yuan, down 19 yuan.

There was not much development in local silk transactions yesterday, as everyone is waiting for today's New York market conditions.

Yesterday, 1463 packages of tea arrived from Hong Kong, and another 200 packages arrived from Tianjin.

### Medicinal Materials: Trichosanthes Peel Arrives

Trichosanthes peel is... [The original text is incomplete here.] I checked the previous market... I believe that dozens of packages shipped by Huaguo Wheel by vendors at the end of last month are still under inspection, and transactions will likely be completed soon.

### Grains: So-Called Production and Sales Cooperation in Rice and Grain; Japanese and Chinese Grain Merchants Jointly Establish the Dachang Company to Jointly Control the Sales of Rice, Wheat, and Miscellaneous Grains; Foreign Rice Prices Rise Again, Supply Still Abundant; Rice Inventory is Truly Large, Circulation Accounts for Only 25%

After the rice market turned bullish, yesterday, the sentiment was even better. The morning market saw a rush to buy, with the inland merchants showing the strongest interest, and local shops were also not to be outdone. Speculators and small-scale hoarders were also seen selling and buying, competing to acquire goods, causing prices for general merchants to rise unusually, with prices increasing by one yuan within a short period. For example, No. 1 Saigon rice opened at 45.5 yuan. Afterwards, the sales market became even more active, with prices rising all the way up, increasing by another 0.5 yuan or so. However, after this peak, the market softened again. Initially, the market still showed some hesitation, but by noon, general merchants, seeing the market falter, all withdrew to observe. Speculators and small-scale hoarders sold their profits at high prices, making it difficult for the market to maintain its original state, and it immediately softened. As a result, the prices of all goods compared to the mid-market fell by more than 0.5 yuan, but still rose by 0.5 or 0.6 yuan compared to the previous market. The closing prices were: No. 1 Saigon at 45.2 yuan, No. 2 at 41.7 yuan, Huojiao at 43.5 yuan, Xiaojiao at 40 yuan, mixed broken rice at 36.5 yuan, rice green beans at 38.5 yuan and 38 yuan, Tokyo polished rice at 41 yuan. The supply and demand for glutinous rice were similar, with no gains or losses. The outside dark market for thick and thin japonica rice also heard of a rise of 0.5 yuan, with Kunshan japonica rice at 47.5 to 46 yuan, and Qing Si extra thin rice at 46 or 47 yuan for early and late rice, and so on.

Foreign rice initially rose yesterday, then stabilized, and finally rose again. This was due to the influence of the gold and foreign exchange markets, as well as active speculation, causing the market to rise and fall rapidly, with inconsistent changes. Futures trading was conducted by hoarders and merchants, making the market even more lively. Yesterday morning and afternoon combined, more than 1200 tons were traded. In the morning market, due to Chinese and foreign merchants being reluctant to sell, and because foreign prices were high, making it difficult to approach, prices were immediately raised, with No. 1 Saigon rice for April at 53.5 yuan, and No. 2 Saigon for late April and early May at 50.078 yuan. Later, as speculators released their goods, buying interest weakened slightly, and the afternoon market fell by a small amount. However, the rise in gold prices in the afternoon attracted absorption by local merchants, with No. 2 Saigon reaching as high as 51.2 yuan, and other rice prices also rose. Currently, there are 6000 to 7000 packages of foreign rice open, rising by 1.7 to 1.8 yuan in the morning, and a small amount in the afternoon market, although there were no formal transactions, prices were also shouted up by several jiao.

Recently, people in the rice industry have been spreading rumors about production and sales cooperation, which is said to be an attempt by a certain party to organize a grain transportation and sales company. According to inquiries by our newspaper reporter, this matter is currently being jointly prepared by a group of grain merchants, who plan to establish the "Dachang Company" with a capital of 10 million yuan, with the aim of opening up sources of rice and grains in various regions of the country. However, their progress is very secretive, and the details are unknown. Whether it will be a blessing or a curse for us in the future cannot be predicted. (Remaining)

Another batch of rice from abroad arrived in Shanghai. The Yihwo Shipping Company’s “Mingxing” ship arrived from Haiphong the other day (Sunday) with 6380 bags. In addition, the “Desheng” ship arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning with 800 bags from Hong Kong. Also, from the same ship, 304 bags of foreign rice were transferred to Yantai and 2255 bags of foreign rice were transferred to Tianjin. It is said that another large batch will arrive in Shanghai today on the Norwegian ship “Arbent,” which is directly shipping more than 20,000 bags from Saigon and is expected to enter the port this morning and dock at the Longmao Wharf in Pudong for unloading. Also, the Norwegian ship "Proteus," carrying 22,120 bags from Saigon, is also scheduled to arrive today and dock at the Qichang Warehouse in Pudong for unloading. The amount of rice accumulated in Shanghai is no less than 700,000 to 800,000 bags, but only about a quarter of it is circulating in the market. (Zu)

Flour and Wheat Stable

Flour: Yesterday, the market price of No. 2 flour from the factory was stable at 13.8 yuan, with retail prices for each bag ranging from 13.9 to 14 yuan. Due to the high price, retail sales at stores have decreased rather than increased, so the wholesale transactions on this street are no longer as numerous as in the past when supplies were sold at flat prices. Customer demand is even less active. However, it is reported that some shipments have been transported to Yantai and Qingdao recently, so the customer price for green gun carriage flour still requires more than 15 yuan, while returned flour and old brands in the market have not changed much, with prices opening at 13.71 yuan. The price of Japanese-made Phoenix brand flour has loosened to the 13 yuan mark.

Wheat: Yesterday, the market remained stable. Although foreign wheat has been arriving gradually, the inventory of domestic wheat has dried up, and the new wheat market is still pending. Chinese factories are unwilling to lower prices to purchase, and holders of goods have no need to compromise. As a result, Fuxin and Fufeng factories each purchased 300 bags, with the price still at 23.5 yuan.

### The Child Who Lost a Leg

— Liu Zhao

Wang’s child hasn't come out to play for more than a month, and I haven't even thought about him these past few days. That day, seeing many of his companions playing in the alley, I suddenly wondered why I hadn't seen him. From the mouths of these children, I learned that he had fallen on the ground and was now sleeping in the hospital.

According to his family, this matter is probably cursed—the child was playing fine, and suddenly he fell and couldn't walk. The family was worried he had broken a bone and sent him to the hospital, but who knew that he would twist his foot from the fall. The twisted leg then developed sores and eventually had to be amputated.

Among the group of children, he wasn't very lively, nor was he the most intelligent, but he had a kind of endearing simple demeanor, a demeanor that seemed hard to find among children in Shanghai.

Last week, the child was discharged from the hospital. He was still as cute, but he was fitted with a wooden crutch and was missing a leg.

For the first few days, he hid at home and wasn't seen outside. Two days later, I saw him leaning against his mother, who was telling her neighbors about the unfortunate incident in a painful way. Many people were gathered around, expressing great sympathy for the unfortunate child. Many of his companions were looking at him with strange eyes. He had become a pitiful unfortunate person. He felt a nameless shame about becoming a cripple. The sympathy that others gave him only made him feel embarrassed. He lowered his head, timidly peeking glances at his long-missed companions.

His companions seemed very unfamiliar with him. He could no longer join their group. The children had treated him as someone different from them. They felt that he was now another kind of person, one of the so-called "cripples." They would no longer call the cripple to play when they were playing.

Once, he stood at the doorway of his house, watching his companions running back and forth playing excitedly. He happily shouted out, "Hey! Who's going to be the king?" But no one answered him. They glanced at him as if he were an adult and went back to playing. Another time, he forgot that he was a cripple and hobbled out of the door. Seeing everyone playing enthusiastically, he said, "Why didn't you call me?" "Isn't your foot crippled?" "How can you come if you're crippled?" When he heard this answer, he was silent. His weak heart suffered the greatest blow. He felt the great sorrow of life. Silently, he hobbled back into the house.

The nickname "cripple" was naturally and quickly added to his head. At first, when people stared at his leg and showed surprise or sympathy, he would always lower his head in shame or turn around and go home. Gradually, he felt embarrassed and angry about this sympathy. When others stared at his leg, he would often respond with an angry look. But recently, he seemed to have accepted that he was a cripple. He broke his own small self-esteem. When people stared at his leg, he unnaturally pretended that nothing was wrong, showing that he wasn't ashamed of his lameness.

"What will this child do in the future?" His mother felt sadness about her own son's future. "What else can he do besides being a bookkeeper?" The child's future seemed to be covered by a layer of dark cloth. Is there a foothold for cripples in this society?

### Edison’s Son, the Inventor

— Chen Shichao

The new U.S. Secretary of the Navy, Charles Edison, is the son of the famous practical electrical inventor Thomas Edison. His endurance and diligence in his work are just like those of his industrious father. But that’s where their similarities end. Charles is not an inventor, but rather an administrator and industrialist.

The new Secretary of the Navy graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1913, and in the same year, he joined the factory founded by his father. When his father died in 1931, he succeeded as the general manager of the Edison Industries Company in West Orange City.

Edison, from the beginning, was an enthusiastic supporter of the New Deal. On November 18, 1936, he was appointed as the Undersecretary of the Navy. His involvement with the political situation was even earlier than this. Before taking office, he first served as the director of the New Jersey Emergency Relief Administration, the chairman of the New Jersey Recovery Committee, and the chairman of the District Labor Committee.

Charles is of medium height, with a gentle and refined manner, and is a close friend of President Roosevelt. His former black hair has now gradually turned gray. He is currently forty-nine years old, but still looks very young.

The new Secretary of the Navy has gained a wealth of experience since the last World War. At that time, his father was the chairman of the Naval Advisory Board, and he served as an assistant. At the same time, he supervised the West Orange factory in manufacturing combat materials.

Later, when he served as the Undersecretary of Navy under Secretary Swanson, Edison's experience and knowledge of naval affairs became even richer. He paid particular attention to factories, docks, naval bases, and other coastal construction projects.

His interests are in the fields of intellect and liberalism. After taking up his new post, he is likely to focus on recruiting naval personnel. His main pastime is fishing. Other hobbies include playing golf, collecting books, and playing the piano.

Edison was born in East Orange City on August 3, 1890. He studied at Groton Academy and Hotchkiss School, and finally graduated from the Institute of Technology. Charles married Catherine Hawkins of Cambridge on March 27, 1918.

Profession

### An Apprentice's Autobiography

— Yin

On a certain evening in the twelfth lunar month when I was sixteen years old, my father told me: After this year, I will be sent to a lumber shop by his friend to be an apprentice. Although I didn’t welcome it, I knew that a man couldn’t rely on his parents for life, so I wasn’t too sad. Thinking of my brother’s state of crying and sobbing when he left home, how weak and pitiful!

In the first month of the following year, I entered the shop; what first caught my eye was, of course, the lumber piled all over the place. Entering the shop, all those sitting there were unfamiliar faces. My father asked me to greet them one by one. What I paid most attention to was naturally my master—the manager. I saw that he had delicate features, was about thirty years old, of medium height, wore glasses, was pleasant but strict, and his words were gentle but serious. His handsome demeanor was exactly the kind of master I had always imagined. At that time, he had someone who was asked to call him “elder brother” take me upstairs to arrange my luggage. I then asked his name, and he also asked about my hometown. We immediately got along very well. He was the second person to give me a good impression after I entered the shop.

Since then, I began to use my "way of dealing with the world"—humility is the only key to treating people, and diligence and frugality are the only methods of conducting oneself in the world. From the manager down to the shop assistants, I was always very humble. When I didn’t understand something and asked, people were naturally happy to guide me. I did everything in the shop to the best of my ability, and I also had handwriting and nimble abacus skills that I could be proud of, so it wasn't long before I earned a chorus of "tsk-tsk" of praise. Everyone in the shop got along well with me, and no one made things difficult for me. I also used my evenings to study foreign languages. In my free time, I wrote some articles and submitted them to various newspapers and magazines. With the proceeds, I bought some books to read. I lived like this for a year.

In short, the apprentice life I experienced, although not happy, definitely cannot be said to be painful. I knew that my way of dealing with the world was not wrong, so I firmly believed that if people can faithfully use it, then they will have unknowingly created a happy and broad road for their future.

Random Thoughts

### "Raising Children to Prevent Old Age"

— Niu Zheng

Our history has already written a page of epoch-making changes. Great realities are being laid out before us. Regarding the ancient saying "raising children to prevent old age," I feel that it is necessary to add a new annotation.

To trace the origin of this saying, in the past, it was thought that sons belonged to individual private property, and the purpose of raising sons was to prevent oneself from having to be supported by one's sons when one became old and weak. From this saying, we can infer how little national ideology there was. The fact that the meaning of this saying was not correctly understood was also a major reason for China's long-term weakness. Just imagine, if all the sons in a country went to serve and support their parents, then who would come out to contribute to the country? Would there still be brave young soldiers on the battlefield?

The meaning of our lives is nothing more than transforming the dark side of reality and seeking welfare for the public. Therefore, seeking welfare for the public and transforming reality are the inherent duties of every individual. However, the "old age" of a person is inevitable. When one is old and weak, there are naturally many things that one cannot do. So, who will continue to work hard for oneself! To whom will the responsibility of "transformation" be handed over? One's own son is naturally the most appropriate person.

Therefore, I say that raising sons is for the prevention of old age, to prevent oneself from being able to serve the country, the nation, or all of humanity when one is old.

Zhang: "Old Li, the weather is so nice, why are you wearing a raincoat and galoshes? Are you going crazy?"

Li: "Because the neighbor's cat died."

Zhang: "Ha, that's really strange! What does the neighbor's cat dying have to do with you?"

Li: "Then what does me wearing a raincoat and galoshes have to do with you?"

Entertainment Circles

### Spring Drama

— Zou Bu

These days are when the schools are on vacation, and the proper entertainment should be watching dramas, etc. Now, I'll briefly introduce the three kinds of dramas I've seen:

(1) "Li Xiucheng's Martyrdom" has been performed more than sixty times at the Lafayette Theatre, and its performance record is comparable to Wei Ruhui's "Regrets of the Late Ming Dynasty." The author, Yang Hansheng, mostly based it on "Li Xiucheng's Confession" (see "Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Poetry and Prose Excerpts"). Cao Juren is also very interested in this, and once wrote a small book for the former New Life Bookstore as part of the Mass Library series. The protagonist, Yan Jun, is very successful in playing Li Xiucheng, far better than his Wu Sangui in "Chen Yuanyuan." With a short beard and handsome eyebrows, especially the last scene in plain clothes, he is truly dignified. Coupled with the ancient sword in the copper plate, it makes Li Xiucheng all the more outstanding, and the performer's success all the more apparent.

(2) The "Peach Blossom Spring," recently performed by the Great Bell Drama Society at the Russian Art Theatre on Avenue Foch, is by Wei Ruhui. The general idea is that scorched earth can become a new peach blossom forest, unafraid of the destruction of violence. This reminds me of a poem "Phoenix Nirvana" in Guo Moruo's "Goddess," in which a new phoenix can be born from the ashes. It also reminds me of an ancient poem, which contains the line: "The wildfire cannot burn it out, the spring breeze blows it back to life." When the little girl Xu Bi, who plays the shepherd boy, runs across the bridge with a peach blossom branch, shouting "New buds, new buds," the audience all laugh at her innocence and vitality, and laugh with great hope. Yang Fan, Qiao Qiao, and others' songs, accompanied by the band in the audience, are also extremely melodious and moving; finally, the magnificent chorus makes us even more excited.

(3) "Sunrise" has also been performed for many days at the Pudong Building. I had seen Fengzi's performance before, but unfortunately I didn't see the third act in the third-class brothel; although it was fully restaged in Tokyo, Japan later, I still couldn't see it; this regret has been compensated by this time. Due to Tang Huaiqiu and others' long-term experience in the north, the scene in this act is extremely realistic. This drama is even more meaningful when it is restaged now. There are really too many people doing speculative business now, and Pan Yueting's failure can be a lesson for such people. The actors are all very hardworking and almost flawless.

### Secrets of the Film Set—How to Dub

The original title was "Secrets Behind the Silver Screen," but for fear that readers would misunderstand that the dubbing work was done behind the screen when the movie was shown, it was changed to "Film Set" to show that this is the dubbing method used during film production.

### Choice of Entertainment

— Sheng Yi

I remember someone saying, "Life without entertainment is like a desert lacking water." Indeed, entertainment occupies a very important position in people's lives.

Many people currently feel depressed and bored. What is the reason for this? It is precisely because of the lack of noble entertainment, and the lack of spiritual adjustment after work. As long as you listen to a few pieces of music, sing a few songs, play chess, chat, etc.; the troubles in your heart will disappear invisibly. Noble entertainment can often make people feel refreshed and full of vitality. However, low-level entertainment puts people's bodies and minds in a difficult situation: the leisure class uses prostitution, gambling, or opium smoking as pastimes. As a result, their health deteriorates day by day, they hold a body full of diseases and groan, and it is too late to regret.

Noble entertainment can create a new life for you, while low-level entertainment destroys your health. We must be careful in choosing entertainment.

### Wang Xichun's Future

— Zhu Shilin

I admit that Xichun is a wonderful flower in the art world, but she seems to be quite a distance away from maturity. We might as well review her past and present. Her good points are worth praising; her shortcomings, if we can see them, can be corrected, so that we don't ruin her future.

I have only heard of her name and have never met her, so I can only avoid discussing it. Last year, I went to the Carlton to see Brother Ti’s Xiang Fei’s Hatred, which was the first time I met her. After watching the play, honestly, I didn’t have a very good impression of Wang Xichun, because she didn’t fully express the steadfast and strong character of Xiang Fei. The Xiang Fei on the stage was just an ordinary actress shaking her sleeves and walking in small steps.

Recently, she also participated in the work of filming movies. Movies are realistic dramas, which are completely different from the performance methods of Peking Opera. At first, we were worried that she might not be able to get rid of the stage style; but you see her, confidently stepping into the film set, and skillfully making various expressions in front of the camera; memorizing extremely long lines in a very short period of time; without any stage movements, without any panic; everywhere she reveals her talent for acting; no one can tell that she is still filming for the first time; this is truly a miracle.

During the filming period, I naturally had a fairly long time to spend with her, which gave me ample opportunity to observe her "privately" from the sidelines. I think she doesn't have the unspeakable habits of today's famous female actors at all; except for an extra "follower" coming in and out, I can't see any difference between her and other movie actors. She has lively youth and vigorous energy; she speaks her mind without reservation and has no hidden thoughts; sometimes she is as innocent as a baby, and sometimes she is as mischievous as a naughty child; she is truly a lovable child!

Female actor Xu Xiuwen wanted to return to Beiping after the Kui De Troupe stopped performing at the Imperial Palace Grand Theatre, but she was persuaded by friends to stay, so she did not go with all the actors of the Kui De Troupe when they went north on the Shuntian Wheel. Now she has decided to return on the 6th, and all procedures and ticket purchases are in progress.

Xin Yanqiu has stopped performing for renovation since yesterday. The results of this performance are satisfactory. She and the supporting actors have decided to take the train back to Ping on the 5th. Yu Zhenfei will also return to his hometown in Suzhou to sweep the tombs.

Golden New Corner Cheng Yanqiu and his party arrived in Shanghai yesterday and will perform starting tomorrow.

The Yifeng Drama Society's five new plays of The Erudite Official will begin to be launched at the Carlton Grand Theatre and will probably premiere at the beginning of next month.

Li Hongchun received a telegram from his home in Ping, stating that his old mother had passed away. Hongchun was unable to rush back to Beiping for the funeral, so he remitted 500 yuan to handle the funeral. He himself continues to perform in Shanghai as usual.
