### Under Nazi Control: Sudden Reshuffle of French Cabinet, Laval Dismissed, Flandin Succeeds as Foreign Minister, Communiqué Claims Franco-German Relations Unaffected

Geneva - General Pétain announced on French radio at 6:45 last night that Foreign Minister Laval had been replaced by Flandin, stating that Franco-German cooperation was progressing and that the National Revolution was also advancing. After the announcement, the French national anthem was played. General Pétain has informed German leader Hitler of the cabinet reshuffle. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 15th)

Vichy - The new French cabinet continued to meet this afternoon. Political observers believe that the French cabinet will undergo further reshuffles. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 15th)

Vichy - Regarding the cabinet reshuffle, the government issued a communiqué tonight, stating, "President Pétain, in order to enhance the unity of the cabinet, has decided to abolish the position of Vice-President. In the future, intelligence work will be handled directly by the President's office. As far as foreign relations are concerned, this cabinet reshuffle will not affect the current relations between France and Germany. This can be seen from the fact that President Pétain received a cordial telegram from German leader Hitler yesterday, informing him that the remains of the Duke of Reichstadt, the son of Napoleon I, could be returned to France for burial. Moreover, President Pétain also telegraphed to Hitler today, explaining our country's position regarding the reorganization of the central government, and stating that Flandin was appointed as Foreign Minister because, in the President's view, Flandin, with the support of public opinion, could continue to promote the close cooperation policy between France and Germany better than Laval. As the position of Vice-President has been abolished, Laval will no longer be Pétain's successor. If the President cannot continue to govern, his successor will be elected by the Council of State. In addition, the remains of the Duke of Reichstadt are scheduled to be buried next to the tomb of Napoleon I tomorrow, and a memorial service will be held at the Invalides in Paris. President Pétain will not be able to attend the funeral in person due to the current situation, and will send Navy Minister Admiral Darlan and General Laure as representatives." (Havas dispatch, 14th)

### New Cabinet List

Vichy - The French cabinet was reshuffled yesterday. The new cabinet members appointed by Marshal Pétain are: Minister of Transportation Peyrouton, Minister of Colonies Major General Platon, and the selections for the Council of Ministers are Alibert, Flandin, Peyrouton, Pucheu, Huntziger, Darlan, Caziot, and Pétain. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 15th)

Pétain Explains Reasons for Reshuffle

Vichy - Marshal Pétain reshuffled the cabinet today, dismissing Vice-President and Foreign Minister Laval and appointing Flandin, the leader of the central faction and former Prime Minister, as Foreign Minister. At the same time, Education Minister Ripert also resigned and was succeeded by Chevalier. Regarding this matter, President Pétain also made a radio address to the nation, explaining that this cabinet reshuffle was purely due to domestic political reasons and would not affect the current relations between France and Germany. His original words are as follows: "French compatriots, I have taken a decision that is in the interests of the country, that is, Vice-President and Foreign Minister Laval has left office and is no longer a member of the cabinet. The vacant position of Foreign Minister will be filled by Flandin.

Amendment to the Draft Constitution

Article 4 of the draft constitution, which stipulates the successor to the President, has also been abolished. (Note: This article stipulates that Laval should succeed the President in the future.) In order to unify and strengthen the government, I have decided to abolish the Vice-President's office, and the intelligence department originally attached to the Vice-President's office will also be transferred to the government. Article 4 of the draft constitution is now amended as follows: "If the President is unable to perform his duties for any reason, his successor will be determined by the Council of Ministers." My decision is purely for legal and political reasons and will not affect our country's relations with Germany. I will continue to preside over the central government as the head of state, and our country's reconstruction work will continue." (Havas dispatch, 14th)

Intelligence Agency Directly Under Government

Vichy - After the French cabinet reshuffle, the intelligence agency will no longer be managed by the Vice-President, but will be directly under the control of Prime Minister Baudouin. The secretary-general of the agency, Cazala, will be succeeded by Congressman Béguin. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 15th)

Dictatorial Leader Seizes Power

Vichy - Last night, the elderly Marshal Pétain implemented political reforms, expelling Vice-President and Foreign Minister Laval and placing all dictatorial power of defeated France under his own iron fist. This white-haired hero of the Great War revealed on the radio that his actions were entirely due to "internal relations." Pétain appointed former Prime Minister Flandin, who admired Nazi Germany, as Foreign Minister. Shortly after this reshuffle, news came that several French political figures had been arrested and imprisoned in Bourrépeyre, where former Prime Minister Daladier and former Allied Commander-in-Chief General Gamelin were awaiting trial for "war crimes" at the outbreak of the European war. The number of arrests was not clear last night, although news from Bern claimed that Laval, known as Pétain's "right-hand man," was also among those arrested. (International dispatch, 15th)

Laval Loses Freedom

New York - The New York World-Telegram reported yesterday that it had learned from reliable sources that French police had arrested Vice-President Laval and taken him to an undisclosed location. The newspaper also said that on the eve of Laval's visit to Germany, French police searched his residence and confiscated his newspapers. It was also learned that Hitler's talks with Laval were conducted after obtaining Vichy's permission, allowing German troops to pass through unoccupied French territory to assist. It is said that President Pétain opposed this suggestion, while Laval supported it. (United Press dispatch, 15th)

Vichy - Laval's whereabouts remained a mystery as of this afternoon. There are conflicting rumors. Some say that Laval is under police surveillance in his private residence near Vichy, but one thing is certain: Laval's colleagues are still being held in a hotel by President Pétain's guards. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 15th)

Internal Political Views Vary in Vichy

London - A Reuters diplomatic correspondent said that the dismissal of Vichy government official Laval and the appointment of former Prime Minister Flandin as Vice-President and Foreign Minister indicate serious differences of opinion within Vichy, but do not necessarily mean a shift in Vichy's policy. Flandin is the leader of the Democratic Alliance Party, but he has always tended towards totalitarian systems. His telegram to Hitler after the Munich Conference aroused opposition from the French people. Since the defeat of France, he has often been close to the enemy. When Laval first decided to go to Paris to meet with the German authorities, the Germans were meeting with Flandin, making Laval wait in another room, which shows the extent of the German's closeness with Flandin. Laval has been unpopular for some time. Now that General Pétain has dismissed him from his two positions, he probably no longer trusts him. However, whether Flandin can successfully persuade Pétain to accept his well-known views remains to be seen. The changes in the military situation in Albania and Libya will definitely cause repercussions in both the occupied and unoccupied zones of France. If not, it would be very strange. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)

Tension in Vichy

Vichy - Laval's departure and Flandin's entry into the cabinet have created a tense atmosphere in Vichy. The French cabinet held a meeting from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM yesterday and did not issue a communiqué. An hour later, the Council of State was convened again, with strict security. Just before midnight, Laval smiled and walked out of the meeting hall, looking down, carrying a bundle of documents in his hand, and drove away by car. The destination was not announced. It was then learned that Vice-President and Foreign Minister Laval had resigned at 10:15 PM. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 15th)

French Public Opinion Gaining Strength

London - Agence France-Presse reported that Laval's departure from the Vichy political stage is clear evidence of the increasing strength of French public opinion, which can influence government decisions. The French people's hatred of Laval is growing, so French people at home and abroad support General Pétain's statement that he was dismissed for the sake of national interests. The British army's victory in Africa has made the French people more determined in their hatred of the policy of close cooperation between France and Germany, so those who advocate this policy must leave office. However, Flandin's character does not guarantee the restoration of Anglo-French rapprochement. His appointment may produce unexpected events. However, Flandin is also aware that Dunton's departure was prompted by public opinion, and he may not repeat the same mistakes and hope that the French people can submit to the German system. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)

Flandin's Brief Biography

Vichy - The new Foreign Minister, Flandin, was born on April 12, 1889. His father once served as the Governor-General of French Tunisia. On May 10, 1914, he was elected as a member of parliament for the Yonne department. He was re-elected in subsequent elections. During the First World War, he enlisted as an air force pilot and participated in major battles, achieving great merit. In 1917, he was transferred to work in the Ministry of Aviation and began to leave the military. Because of his capable work, he was soon promoted to Undersecretary of the Ministry of Aviation and was the first French representative to the International Aviation Committee. In peacetime, he belonged to the left-wing Republican group in the parliament and served as a member of various important subcommittees of the parliament. In 1928 and 1929, he was elected as Vice-President of the parliament. His first appointment as a minister was in the Massal cabinet in 1924, serving as Minister of Commerce. In 1929, he served as Minister of Commerce again in the Tardieu cabinet. The following year, the Tardieu cabinet was reorganized, and Flandin was reappointed. In January 1931, when Laval formed a cabinet, he was appointed Minister of Finance. In February 1932, when Tardieu made a comeback, Flandin continued to hold office. On November 9, 1934, Flandin was first ordered to form a cabinet, and he resigned on May 31, 1935, and was succeeded by Laval as Prime Minister, but he was still invited to serve as a minister without portfolio. In January 1936, the Sarraut cabinet was formed, and he served as Minister of Foreign Affairs until June 4 of that year, when the leader of the Socialist Party, Blum, formed a Popular Front cabinet, and he withdrew from the central government until today. During this time, Flandin, although out of office, continued to work for peace, especially during the Munich Conference in September 1938, where he made the greatest contribution.

Editorial

### Coup in the Tragedy of France

According to Vichy news yesterday, French President Pétain reorganized the cabinet on the 14th, dismissing Vice-President and Foreign Minister Laval and appointing Baudouin and Flandin as Prime Minister and Foreign Minister respectively; and fundamentally abolished the provision in the current draft constitution that the Vice-President is qualified to succeed the President. This is the first cabinet reshuffle since France abandoned the war and made peace. This is a major political upheaval and the most drastic change since the establishment of the totalitarian system. This not only shows the unease in French politics, but also reveals that the difficulties encountered by the Vichy government are increasing due to the increasingly turbulent European situation. Although things cannot be said to be surprising, it is certainly not what the Pétain regime expected when it decided to pay the German demands.

At the beginning of this summer, when France signed an armistice agreement with Germany, the European situation was in extreme chaos. The prestige of the Axis powers was also at its peak, so some people who lacked confidence praised the courage of Pétain and others, who dared to risk great disapproval to save France. Even the Pétain regime itself boasted of seeking a glorious peace at that time. When the terms of the armistice agreement were announced, people had already realized that the victorious country might not necessarily have the virtue of generosity, and the price of France's peace was not only the occupation of two-thirds of the country, the dissolution of the army, and the transfer of weapons, but its future destiny was from the beginning suspended in a state of uncertainty, all awaiting the final outcome of the Anglo-German war. As time went on, France's predicament became more and more apparent. The German army's supplies were vast, the French people were starving everywhere, the colonies were falling apart, and people's hearts were restless. The cooperation negotiations launched by Germany to France in late October became a great difficulty for the Vichy regime. That negotiation, through Laval's travels and the meeting between Hitler and Pétain, although only ended with the establishment of a cooperation agreement in principle, Germany has never stopped trying to invite France to help Germany in the war, and at the same time laid the groundwork for this cabinet reshuffle. This fully proves that France not only failed to preserve its glory, but even failed to achieve peace. The reward for surrendering to the armistice is endless demands and troubles. Reading Pétain's message to the people on October 10, full of sorrow, it is not difficult to imagine the misery and suffering France encountered after surrendering.

Because France was suddenly reduced from a first-class power to a position of being slaughtered and enslaved, the suffering felt by the French people is not comparable to that of emerging countries such as Poland and Czechoslovakia, or small countries such as Denmark and the Netherlands. In addition, Germany and France have been enemies for generations, with deep-rooted prejudices. To suddenly change their psychology to accept German domination and cooperate with Germany is contrary to human nature and difficult to achieve in reality, which further forms a major shadow between the French people and the Vichy government. The faction of the French authorities led by Laval has been constantly arguing to eliminate old grievances and rely on Germany, and even advocating accepting Germany's demands to cede the territories of Alsace and Lorraine in exchange for the realization of "peace." It is no wonder that they are despised and criticized by the general French people. Originally, the foundation of the totalitarian system can only be built by establishing achievements abroad. If it is absolutely centralized internally and only knows humiliation externally, its regime will of course have no possibility of being consolidated. Laval, as a speculative politician who suddenly became powerful, lacks achievements and is not a source of faith. His insistence on surrendering to Germany is based on a very slim hope: according to his argument, only the defeat of Britain can change France's position, so he advocates making any concessions to help Germany. However, it is not known that if Britain really collapses, Germany will do whatever it wants, and France's future position will inevitably become more tragic, and Britain's defeat is still unimaginable. Therefore, when Britain's position is becoming stronger and the Axis' situation is gradually becoming unfavorable, Laval's route is becoming more and more reversed, even if he personally continues to maintain his consistent views. How can he force the French people to blindly follow? In mid-November, when the German army forcibly relocated the French people, the German side said that it was based on the cooperation agreement established during the meeting between Hitler and Laval. The Vichy side resolutely denied it: eventually, the German force had to temporarily stop the forced relocation, which was an exposure of the decline of Laval's political life.

Previously, many people suspected that President Pétain was only Laval's tool, and Laval also had an air of complacency and arrogance: now, it can be proved that this is not the case. At least in some measures in the recent three months, it can be seen that there are fundamental differences between the two, such as their response to the recent Franco-German negotiations. Another example is that after former Foreign Minister Baudouin left office due to a conflict with Laval, the Foreign Minister was concurrently held by Laval, but Baudouin was appointed as Secretary-General of the Prime Minister's Office and entrusted with Pétain's trust to preside over the youth movement that he valued most, which can be seen as Pétain's layout for launching this coup. In addition, Pétain also imitated the methods of Germany and Italy to carry out the organization of the French stormtroopers. All of this shows that Pétain does have major ambitions outside of Laval's route. However, in any case, today's Vichy regime is ultimately entrusted to the power of the German side and is produced to adapt to the humiliating conditions of the armistice agreement. Unless the European situation is completely changed, it is impossible to fundamentally change its destined tragedy. Looking at this cabinet reshuffle, although Baudouin succeeded as Prime Minister, Flandin, who has always advocated being pro-German and is rumored to have recently received great favor from the German side, was appointed as Foreign Minister. Therefore, its future policies may differ from Laval's in terms of method, but it is impossible to jump out of the humiliating rut of close cooperation with Germany. Therefore, this reorganization of the Vichy regime, in fact, still cannot alleviate its current major difficulties, let alone have any constructive actions. And some French people who are unwilling to give in to humiliation and shame, seeing that Britain's position in the war is becoming stronger and stronger, and has not collapsed rapidly after France, must deeply regret the mistakes in their previous judgment of the future of the war and the failure to stop fighting alongside Britain. This is a painful lesson. At the same time, it is also an increasingly difficult problem for Vichy.

Near Jiaozuo, five locomotives were destroyed, killing more than 400 Japanese. They have been attacking Yanmen, Boai, Qinyang, Wenxian, Kaifeng and other places separately for days, killing a total of more than 1,700 Japanese. The Japanese commander, Major Iida, was also injured and killed on Daoging Road.

In Zhejiang and Jiangxi, the Chinese army is becoming increasingly active in Hangjia and Hugu. The warehouses and observation posts of the Jianqiao Airport were burned down by the Chinese army. The highway bunkers near Dangyang were all destroyed. The Chinese army annihilated more Japanese in Pinghu and Haiyan, and captured more prisoners. In Pengze, Jiangxi, the Chinese army captured Xiangjiaqiao and other strongholds and chased after the Japanese north of Malukou Huangtuling in separate ways. The Japanese army, which attacked Zhuashan in the Minshan area, was ambushed by the Chinese army and retreated. The Chinese army is now sweeping the Japanese army in the Shuinanwang area, southeast of Fengxin.

In Jiangsu and Anhui, the suburbs of Qingpu have been taken by the Chinese army, and another part has arrived in Kunshan County. Fierce fighting has been taking place in the Tianchang and Liuhe areas for days, killing more than 400 Japanese, including many captains, such as Zizao Zelong, Zuo Tianhao Tian, etc., which shows that the quality of the Japanese is declining and they are vulnerable. The Chinese army in southern Anhui captured Shazitou, southeast of Guichi, and the big and small Maoling, north of Qingyang, and other strongholds on the 8th.

In Fujian and Guangdong, there are Japanese soldiers along the border of Fujian Province who attempted to land, but were repulsed by the Chinese army.

### Cooperation Movement Highly Developed in the Provinces of Shanxi and Hebei Guerrilla Zones; 60 Industrial Cooperatives Established in Southern Shanxi; Rapid Progress in Iron Smelting and Cotton Weaving Industries

Chongqing – The industrial cooperative movement in the guerrilla zones of Shanxi and Hebei provinces is developing daily. These small-scale production enterprises are not only vital for maintaining the guerrilla war economy but also compensate for the insufficiency of production in metropolitan areas. For example, the Zhongtiao Mountains in southern Shanxi, which is a crucial strategic stronghold for [guerrilla] warfare, has already established 60 industrial cooperatives. There are also many cooperatives in the Taihang Mountains in eastern Shanxi, and recently, several cooperatives have been established in the border area between Shanxi and Henan. Five officials dispatched by the China Cooperative Association are providing guidance. Furthermore, these cooperatives are located very close to the front lines, so they are highly mobile and can advance and retreat simultaneously with the troops. In terms of the business of each, textile weaving and iron smelting are the most common. For instance, in 22 villages and towns in western Hebei, there are a total of 260 cooperatives, most of which were organized and established within the past eight months. The most important of these is a certain cooperative in Laiyuan City, known for its iron smelting. As for central and southern Hebei, there are also several cooperatives engaged in cotton weaving, which have provided employment for thousands of refugees in disaster areas. (Havas dispatch, 14th)

### Vietnam Denies It Will Attack Thailand; Prepares to Open Negotiations with Thailand to Resolve Border Disputes

Hanoi – Thai newspapers have published news stating that French troops within Vietnam are preparing to launch a large-scale offensive against Thailand. Well-informed sources here have categorically denied this, saying that such news is purely fabricated. Vietnam has never had any demands on its neighbor, let alone any intention of invading it. Vietnam's actions are limited to expressing that the repeated actions taken by Thai troops against Vietnam recently cannot be excused as errors or attributed to the individual actions of a few soldiers. In short, French troops have never taken provocative actions. All past actions were due to the activities of Thai troops. This has been repeatedly stated by officials, and in fact, it has even been announced that preparations are being made to reopen negotiations with Thailand. So far, this attitude has not changed. In other words, the Vietnamese government is ready to implement the spirit and letter of the non-aggression pact between Vietnam and Thailand. The key is to promptly exchange the ratification documents of this agreement by both sides, and then appoint a committee to demarcate the border line on the Mekong River. Moreover, the Vietnamese government is willing to establish a joint committee to resolve the recent border disputes. However, it must be stated that the prerequisite for implementing the non-aggression pact is that Thailand immediately cease all acts of aggression. If that happens, then the Vietnamese government will also cease retaliation. (Havas dispatch, 14th)

Governor-General of Vietnam and Wife Host Japanese Representatives

Hanoi – Lieutenant General Catroux, the Governor-General of Vietnam, and his wife hosted a banquet today for the Japanese military delegation. General Sumita, the head of the Japanese delegation, and Mr. Suzuki Rokuro, the Consul-General in Hanoi, were all present. (Havas dispatch, 14th)

Japanese Side Compensates for One Aircraft

Hanoi – A French aircraft was shot down by Japanese anti-aircraft artillery over Leizhou Island on July 7th of this year, resulting in the simultaneous death of all pilots and passengers. According to an official announcement here, the Japanese government has remitted 192,893 Vietnamese currency as compensation for the families of the victims. Furthermore, to show the close relationship between Japan and Vietnam, they have presented the Vietnamese government with a twin-engine aircraft as compensation. (Havas dispatch, 14th)

### Farmers in Yongkang County Sell Land to Donate Funds

Jinhua – Li Jingkui, a 71-year-old farmer from the Tenth Bao of Shanzeng, Yongkang County, Zhejiang, is concerned about the national crisis and cannot sleep or eat in peace. Feeling ashamed that he is too old to join the army, he sold six mu of land he used for retirement, obtaining six thousand yuan, and presented it to the county government to be forwarded to the central government for the purchase of aircraft. The county government, in addition to remitting the funds to the province for transfer to the national treasury, has also petitioned the provincial government to grant awards of merit. It is reported that the provincial government has already petitioned the central government for permission to issue awards and commendations to encourage others. (Dispatch, 15th)

### Overseas Chinese Invest Enthusiastically in the Motherland

Chongqing – Zhou Qigang, Deputy Minister of the Overseas Department of the Kuomintang, recently stated that overseas Chinese investment is no longer a theoretical issue but a factual one. Since the outbreak of the European War, especially after Japan's aggressive southward advance, overseas Chinese urgently hope to invest in the motherland. Last year, during the anti-Chinese tide in Siam, overseas Chinese remitted more than 300,000 yuan to Kunming, but unfortunately, it was not used well. In the future, in addition to encouraging individual investments by overseas Chinese, there should be sound organizations to guide them. Overseas Chinese investment should be promoted by the government, but not through political methods, to avoid the problem of "following orders blindly." I proposed convening an overseas Chinese economic conference in the 23rd year [of the Republic, 1934], which was approved by the Executive Yuan, but it did not materialize due to the outbreak of war and repeated relocation of the government. I still intend to promote its realization so that overseas Chinese capital can be fully utilized to promote the construction of the motherland. (Havas dispatch, 14th)

Cairo – It is reported that the rapidly advancing British desert corps completely expelled the defeated Italian troops from Egypt to Libya last night, while British aircraft and warships continuously caused fires and ruins on the main bases of the Italian forces. The latest news from the Egyptian-Libyan border states that the collapse of the Italian forces seems to be increasing with time. It is claimed that several thousand more Italian troops have fled in panic into the narrow passage between Sollum and Bardia, which is often bombed, and have become prisoners or have surrendered. Officials say that the British army's achievements to date include defeating eight Italian divisions, totaling 120,000 men, with five more broken Italian divisions being pursued by the British army. The news from the Sollum and Bardia area states that the situation there is chaotic, like hell. British warships off the coast continuously bombarded large groups of defeated Italian troops with cannons. British aircraft seem to have complete air superiority, circling up and down, arbitrarily bombing Italian supply lines and troops. British officials here believe that the British army's advance has exceeded expectations, and their senior officials said, "Everything is going as expected, which is difficult to achieve in most military operations." (International News Service dispatch, 15th)

Cairo – British and Italian forces are currently engaged in a life-and-death struggle. The Blackshirts are attempting to defend a new position and launch a counterattack. British aircraft bombed the enemy all day yesterday and strafed them with machine guns. The British army is handling a large number of spoils behind its lines. It is estimated that there are now 30,000 prisoners. The Italian army is trying hard to prevent the British army from advancing straight in, but the British army's morale is extremely high, so this task will be very difficult for the Italian army. The British army's progress is so rapid that the latest information received by the rear often does not reflect the most recent battles on the front lines. The campaign began only six days ago, and the British army has already deeply reached the border between Egypt and Libya, which shows the ferocity of the British westward advance. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)

Rome – A bulletin stated that the huge wind in the Egyptian desert area has subsided, which will make the clashes between the Italian and British armies even more fierce than before.

The Italian air force's strength on the front lines has greatly increased compared to before. (United Press dispatch, 15th)

Cairo – A British Air Ministry bulletin stated that one of the two British bombers announced missing on Friday has now safely returned to base.

### Hitler Hastily Seeks Remedial Measures; To Support the Tottering Axis; Large German Army Assembles in Austria; Ordered to Occupy Northern Italian Corridor When Necessary

London – London said today that the Vichy government's personnel changes are promoting a movement of Franco-German cooperation. Even if it did not come from Hitler's request, it was also instructed by him. It is widely believed that France is now moving further away from Germany. Some quarters foresee that the Germans will soon expand the area of French occupation, because Italy is being weakened by the combined attacks of Britain and Greece, and Hitler is eager to find remedial measures to support the tottering Axis. It is expected that German troops may occupy the corridor that leads directly to northern Italy, so that if Mussolini is deposed, they can quickly enter Italy. (International News Service dispatch, 15th)

New York – According to intelligence leaked from Germany to the "New York Daily News," a large number of German troops are now assembled in southwestern Germany and Austria.

Rome – A Rome correspondent for the Haitong News Agency has learned from responsible sources that rumors recently spread by foreign newspapers about strained relations or misunderstandings between the Italian Fascist Party and the military authorities are completely unfounded.

### Greek Troops Charge in Melee; Advance to the Outskirts of Tepelene; Bloody Battle in the Pogradec Area for Three Days and Nights; Greek Troops Seize Several Important Positions

Struga – Greek troops, wielding bayonets, charged to the outskirts of Tepelene yesterday afternoon, and are now only one kilometer away from the city. (United Press dispatch, 15th)

Struga – Greek soldiers fought with exceptional ferocity yesterday, and it seems that they will continue to achieve three major victories soon. Tepelene in the northern sector is already burning in a great fire and will fall soon. Italian forces in Kimaara and Vlore, the main port of Albania, both appear to be preparing to retreat. Italian forces plan to launch a counterattack against the Greek forces from Kimaara and the small and large villages of Xika, to prevent their attack towards Vlore, but the Greek forces are advancing resolutely regardless, and Tepelene has been burning in a great fire since yesterday morning. Greek artillery shelled heavily, and Greek forces once launched a fierce charge, penetrating 800 meters into the Italian positions, but were repelled by the Italian forces. Greek casualties were extremely heavy. The defending troops there appear to be the rearguard of the Italian forces, and their main force has already withdrawn from the city of Tepelene. Greek forces are no more than two kilometers away from the city. Also, in the Pogradec area, Greek forces have seized several important positions. In this area, the Italian forces are fighting extremely bravely, and the weather is bad, so the Greek forces' battles are extremely difficult. (United Press dispatch, 15th)

Athens – The Greek High Command announced this morning that yesterday the Greek army launched a general offensive against the main centers controlled by Italian forces within Albania, occupying several important mountain tops and also capturing prisoners and armaments. The Greek communiqué stated, "Our army's offensive continues to achieve victories, and it has occupied several important mountain tops. A large number of enemy mountain artillery and automatic rifles have fallen into our hands." Greek troops dragged mountain guns over snow-covered passes and repelled a fierce counterattack by Italian forces northwest of Pogradec, occupying several important positions. From these positions, Greek forces can easily attack Elbasan again. Although dense fog obscured the mountain passes, Greek forces continuously bombarded and silenced the Italian artillery that was preventing their advance. Italian forces were only able to stop the Greek advance at one point with strong defenses. Fierce battles have been fought between the two armies there for three days, but Greek forces are gradually encircling the Italian flanks, isolating them. According to unconfirmed reports, the Greek vanguard had entered the outskirts of Tepelene but was repelled by the Italian forces in hand-to-hand combat. (International News Service dispatch, 15th)

London – According to a communiqué from the Greek military headquarters last night, the Greek offensive continues to be successful, and important high grounds have been occupied.

Greek forces are continuing to advance in this area. Although the Italian forces are working hard to stop the Greek advance and prevent the fall of new strongholds, they are ultimately ineffective. The Italian forces retreated, suffering heavy losses, and many were captured. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)

### Fu Bi Wang - Currently Imprisoned

New York - Former Baroness of Sherbrooke, Mrs. Stevenson, a renowned female sculptor and a close friend of the Belgian royal family, told the International News Service yesterday that King Leopold of Belgium is now actually imprisoned by the Nazis at his summer retreat in Segnon, 100 miles from Brussels. Mrs. Stevenson also stated that Nazi troops have been heavily guarding the palace, and no one is allowed to see the King without a special pass from the German governor. According to Mrs. Stevenson, King Leopold has been forgotten by the world since he issued the historic order to surrender to the German forces. He now lives in the palace with his mother and his brother, Prince Charles. Rumors have it that Hitler has dispatched Leopold as a special envoy to the Vatican to present the German side's peace proposals. The former Baroness refuted this and said that the rumor was completely fabricated and may be a German propaganda tactic to alienate the King from his people and make them think that the King has betrayed them to the Nazis.

### France Decides to Protect Overseas Territories by Force - New Governor Appointed for Martinique Island

Vichy - A spokesman for the French government declared that France will protect its overseas territories by force. Regarding Martinique Island in the Americas, which currently has no Germans or Italians and is not in danger of being annexed by the Axis powers, the French government does not believe that the United States will seize the island by force. However, if this were to happen, the United States would inevitably violate the resolutions of the Pan-American Conference in Cuba. Martinique is now completely under French rule, and if anything happens, France will have no choice but to resist. Furthermore, French Head of State Pétain appointed Malini Nicolas as the new Governor of Martinique yesterday. (United Press, 15th)

### Former French Parliamentarian - Makes Remarks - Says U.S. Will Not Participate in European War - Criticizes the French for Lavishing Talk of Foreign Aid

Paris - Former French Member of Parliament, Thorio, generally regarded as a tough politician, told a United Press reporter in his fifth-floor office yesterday on his 42nd birthday that he believes the United States will not participate in the European war. The main reason for the U.S. non-participation is Japan. Thorio said, "I think the United States is already hesitant about participating in the European war because it fears that participation will simultaneously trigger wars in both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The recent German-Italian-Japanese agreement has further strengthened this belief in the United States. I also believe that the lessons learned by France and Britain have made the American people feel that maintaining peace is the right thing to do, and the United States itself is not prepared. This can be seen from the fact that the United States cannot provide France with aircraft assistance." Thorio also said that even if Roosevelt personally tends to uphold anti-totalitarianism, President Roosevelt has to advocate anti-war because of the strong anti-war sentiment of the American people. Regarding the recent attitude of the United States towards France in the war, Thorio made a strict criticism of the so-called US promise to aid France once the war occurred. Thorio said, "France's failure is not only military but also political. The first consequence seen was the destruction of French democracy and the Third Republic. This war could have been avoided, but the French democrats were too fond of war, and this was the consequence. In addition, the French democrats had a great delusion that the democratic countries of the world would be able to help them. These people also thought that the British democrats would do their best to send troops to the European continent to fight, but this hope did not materialize. These people also believed that the American democrats would unite with France, and the first step would be to provide France with material assistance, and the second step would be to help France with manpower. Why was this fact not realized? I think you (referring to the United Press reporter) know more than I do. You must know that the promises in Roosevelt's speech have not been realized in fact. The French democrats do not believe that the Soviet Union can help them in the same way, but the Soviet Union's aid has not been realized either. Because of this, the French democrats feel that they are completely isolated. This is the harm caused by their excessive rashness and delusion of the unity of democratic countries." Thorio also said that democracy cannot represent the real French people, but it is just a political term for defending the interests of financial oligarchs, international economics (which can be said to be Jewish economics), and large capitalists, and it is a concept that all Europeans have long opposed. The French democrats speak of Britain, the Soviet Union, and even the United States, but never mention France. This is because France has been breeding a revolution for many years. This founder of the French People's Party also said that most French people do not believe in war, and when the French took up arms to fight, their resentment towards their own government was almost the same as their resentment towards Germany. Thorio also believes that even if this war had started in October 1939 instead of May 1940, the result would have been the same. Thorio's body is very burly, and most of the space in his small room seems to be occupied by his body. Thorio's voice was loud when he spoke, and his upper and lower jaws moved rapidly. Thorio was initially a Communist member, and shortly after Hitler came to power in Germany, Thorio accepted totalitarianism and became a fierce anti-Communist. Thorio also described his plan to regenerate France, implying in his words that he himself was the person to implement this plan. In the past, Briand also said, "In the future, Thorio may lead France." Thorio said that he believes in a combined state, that is, all the French people are united to form a classless dictatorship of a "great society." This "great society" is based on fraternity and advocates the establishment of a government that is in harmony with the powers that control the European peninsula. Thorio's totalitarian plan also advocates the exclusion of Jews and advocates sending Jews to Africa and other places to form their own country. (United Press, 15th)

### German Ambassador to Japan - Will Not Be Changed for the Time Being

### President Roosevelt - Returns to Washington Today - Tour Aimed at Considering the Situation - Preparing for Major Decisions in the Future

President Roosevelt, on the presidential cruise ship, completed his 3,850-mile inspection tour yesterday. After inspecting four of the eight new military bases in the Caribbean, he safely arrived at the naval shipyard in Charleston, USA. The trip lasted twelve days at sea. He will now stay in Warm Springs for a day of rest, and then return to Washington on Monday afternoon. When the presidential cruise ship passed the port of "Fort de France" in India, the president used binoculars to see the French aircraft carrier Béarn anchored on the beach, with 110 French aircraft that had been ordered from the United States, all being left to rust. There are now 5,000 US Marines stationed at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, and new-style transport destroyers are docked in the port. Everywhere the president traveled, the effectiveness of the US Navy's neutrality patrol duties could be felt to be very high. (United Press, 15th)

Washington - The plan announced by US Defense Committee member Knudsen that US military production should be placed on a war footing is very welcome to many people here. The slow pace of current military production is often discussed, and the public is quite hopeful that President Roosevelt will do something to promote it. It is said that the real reason for the President's tour of the Caribbean is to personally consider the situation and then make major decisions. Knudsen is a recognized expert in the study of military production, and his remarks can make the public accept the decisions that the President is about to announce. Knudsen told a group of important industrialists the day before yesterday about the importance of accelerating the production of defense goods, saying that US aircraft production is 30% behind the schedule set in July, and that the closing of factories on Sundays would make the production schedule fail.

We should also continue to supply them as quickly as possible within the scope possible. If Britain is unable to transport these items, we must also send a few warships to protect them.

### The Reasons for the Mid-Way Split between Pétain and Laval

In June and July, Pétain negotiated an armistice with Germany and Italy on the outside, and abolished democracy and established a dictatorship on the inside. He was originally singing a "double act" with Laval. Before several months had passed, news came that they split mid-way. Where does the reason lie? The following is a translated transcript of a long-distance telephone report sent on the 2nd of last month by the New York Times correspondent in the capital of Switzerland, for reference:

According to a certain well-known French anti-British politician who recently traveled from Vichy to Switzerland for sightseeing, the faction in the French government that hoped for British defeat has gradually lost its influence, while the personal prestige of Head of State Pétain is rising rapidly. The road to the resumption of peace in Europe is distant and full of thorns. Britain's resistance has lasted a long time and seems to be getting stronger and stronger. The French anti-British elements are therefore full of suspicion, and pro-British sentiments are gradually overflowing.

The Vichy government's reconstruction and construction plan must rely on Germany's assistance. In addition to removing dissidents and purging the various causes of the war, as for the attitude of the Italian government, it still insists, but can this plan be completed? It insists on its territorial demands on France. In recent days, the tone of the newspapers of the Axis countries has also echoed each other, causing great disappointment to the Vichy government. It is heard that in the face of such a change in the situation, even Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Laval finds it difficult to justify himself to his government colleagues. Laval recently stated in Paris his determination to eliminate "foreign interference," meaning that he would use all his strength to eliminate British propaganda in France and prevent the influence of those who sympathize with General de Gaulle from spreading any further. In order to promote this policy, Laval hoped that Germany would sincerely accept French "cooperation" and support France's opposition to Italian territorial demands.

In addition, Laval was heard to have pressured Head of State Pétain to accept the demands of the Axis powers, ceding several naval bases in the Mediterranean to Germany and Italy, and even willing to supply part of the French navy to Germany and Italy to attack Britain. However, General Pétain firmly advocated maintaining "glorious neutrality" towards Britain and consistently rejected this proposal.

Currently, rumors are spreading in the unoccupied areas of France, spare no effort, and efforts to refute rumors and correct them are also overwhelming. But as long as General Pétain is in power, his attitude will not change for a day, so it seems that it can be concluded. Pétain was reportedly extremely indignant about the terms of the "peace agreement" accepted by Laval. In short, no matter how Pétain fails in other aspects, he will never allow the French army to help the enemy attack Britain.

### Review of Shanghai Rice Prices

— Li Deming

April: 46.00 yuan

May: 41.00 yuan

June: 66.25 yuan

July: 68.43 yuan

August: 65.75 yuan

September: 75.62 yuan

October: 85.50 yuan

November: 87.00 yuan

Based on the above table, we can see that before 1937, the highest rice price was 12.50 yuan in 1934. After the "August 13" Incident in 1937, the rice price rose slightly, but until 1939, the price per picul was only 24.62 yuan. By this year, the situation has changed drastically. The average rice price rose step by step from 40 yuan in January to 87 yuan by November. On the 4th of this month, the price of white rice even rose to 106 yuan, but it has recently fallen back slightly. Even so, it still cannot but make people shudder!

### Reasons for Today's Rice Price Increase in Shanghai

Shanghai is located on the Yangtze River's southern delta, its fertile land earning it the title of the "Land of Fish and Rice" in Jiangnan. Before "August 13th," Shanghai's rice supply was extremely abundant, with minimal reliance on foreign sources. Annual imports rarely exceeded 300,000 to 400,000 metric tons. After "August 13th," foreign rice imports saw a slight increase, but the majority was still supplied domestically. The following shows the amount of foreign rice imported during the three years from 1937 to 1939:

1937 307,860 metric tons

1938 644,930 metric tons

1939 457,650 metric tons

Of the above three years of foreign rice imports, 1938 was the highest, yet it was only 644,930 metric tons. Considering last year, it was only 457,650 metric tons, not significantly different from pre-war levels. However, this year, the situation has drastically changed, with foreign rice imports reaching record highs. The following details the foreign rice imports from January to October of this year:

Of the above three years of foreign rice imports, 1938 was the highest, yet it was only 644,930 metric tons. Considering last year, it was only 457,650 metric tons, not significantly different from pre-war levels. However, this year, the situation has drastically changed, with foreign rice imports reaching record highs. The following details the foreign rice imports from January to October of this year:

January 1940 370,140 metric tons

February 307,624 metric tons

March 625,444 metric tons

April 317,270 metric tons

May 54,132 metric tons

June 200,659 metric tons

July 485,152 metric tons

August 50,350 metric tons

September 137,810 metric tons

October 577,411 metric tons

Total 3,779,622 metric tons

These figures are definitely not complete, as underreporting is a common tactic among merchants. However, even based on the above numbers, excluding May, September, and October, the imports for months such as March, July, and August exceed the total imports for the entire last year. Other months like January, February, April, June, and October are not far behind last year's total imports. In total, since October of this year, the total foreign rice imports have reached 3,779,622 metric tons, nearly twelve times that of 1937, five times that of 1938, and seven times that of 1939. Therefore, even if the amount of domestic rice shipped to Shanghai has decreased, it is more than offset. Shanghai's food supply and demand can be considered completely problem-free. As for why domestic rice shipments to Shanghai have decreased, the reason can be summarized in one sentence: the Japanese monopolization of sources.

Japan's food supply has always been insufficient. Since the war against China began, the need for food has surged due to military requirements. On the other hand, due to the conscription of farmers, requisitioning of draft horses, and shortage of fertilizers, productivity has plummeted. Last year, Japan's agricultural product income had already decreased, causing a nationwide rice shortage and a rather serious problem. Their only hope was for a bumper harvest this year to compensate, but unexpectedly, Japan's mainland and Korea were hit by drought, leading to another poor rice harvest. According to statistics released by the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, this year's rice production totaled 310,500,000 "斗" (a traditional Chinese unit of dry volume), falling far short of the Japanese target of 355,000,000 "斗," and even compared to the average production of 330,000,000 "斗" over the past four years, it is still 19,500,000 "斗" short. Therefore, Japan is now vigorously reducing rice consumption, even mixing wheat into rice for food. However, Japan's wheat harvest this year is also far worse than last year, so this approach still cannot solve even a fraction of Japan's food crisis. As a result, they have to turn their attention abroad. According to the Far Eastern Survey on October 10th, from December 1939 to March 1940, Japan purchased a total of 2,600,000 metric tons of rice from the countries of the Indochinese Peninsula, accounting for about 6% of Japan's total imports. Japan is now purchasing such a large amount of rice from abroad, which inevitably requires the use of its foreign exchange reserves. However, since the war against China began, military spending has been enormous, and foreign exchange reserves have long been depleted—how can they constantly have huge sums to purchase food from abroad? Therefore, they are using their military power in the occupied areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui to forcibly purchase rice with unprepared military scrip and transport it to Japan. According to statistics, in the past ten months, as much as 7,000,000 metric tons of rice have been shipped from China to Japan.

### Reasons for the Rise in Rice Prices in Shanghai

Therefore, while we cannot say that the rise in rice prices in Shanghai is completely unrelated to this, the main reason is definitely not this.

How much rice is currently in stock in Shanghai is the most concerning issue for the people of Shanghai today, but reports from all sides vary due to their different perspectives. Rice shops deliberately underreport, claiming that Shanghai has only about 400,000 "石" (another traditional Chinese unit of dry volume) of rice in stock, causing people to panic, facilitating their manipulation and hoarding for profit. Administrative authorities and media outlets, on the other hand, tend to overreport, exaggerating and claiming that Shanghai has more than 4 million "石" of rice, hoping to stabilize public sentiment and prevent speculative rice merchants from using their tricks.

In reality, according to what was mentioned in the first section of this article, the total amount of foreign rice imported from January to October this year was indeed more than 3.5 million metric tons. If divided equally over ten months, the monthly import of foreign rice is indeed 320,000 metric tons, roughly 430,000 "石." The monthly consumption of rice in this city is 11,000 "石." Since the surge in rice prices, the common people have mostly been eating porridge or substituting with coarse grains and other substitutes. Therefore, in terms of population, it is actually less than 11,000 "石." For the sake of argument, let's assume it's 11,000 "石." That means that out of the 430,000 "石" each month, after consumption, there is a net surplus of 100,000 "石." Calculated over ten months, the total net surplus should be 1 million "石." Furthermore, assuming that the net surplus in November is also 100,000 "石," then Shanghai's current rice reserves total 1.1 million "石," enough to supply the entire population of Shanghai for more than three months. However, in Shanghai, it is rare to have a day with 1 million "石" of rice in stock, yet rice prices were stable then. Now, despite having unprecedented huge reserves, rice prices have suddenly skyrocketed. This is obviously due to rice profiteers blinded by greed, manipulating and hoarding for profit. And among them are many wealthy merchants. Therefore, "Until Qing Jiao is gone, the troubles of Lu will not end."

### Recent Labor-Management Disputes in Shanghai

— Shazhou

Foreword

What are labor-management disputes? Labor-management disputes refer to disputes arising between employers and workers over the maintenance or modification of employment conditions. In such disputes, in order to implement individual or collective demands, methods other than ceasing work are used, and peaceful compromise is sought to resolve the issue. In short, labor-management disputes are conflicts of will between labor and management that have not reached the point of rupture. Formally and qualitatively, they are distinctly different from strikes and work stoppages, as strikes and work stoppages require the cessation of work to achieve their goals. In this light, labor-management disputes are the prelude to strikes and work stoppages, as well as the cause of them. Labor-management disputes are by no means a local problem; they have a situation where one hair can affect the whole body. Looking inside the wrapping of labor-management disputes, its occurrence is more often than not inseparable from economic causes. Labor-management disputes rarely occur during periods of industrial decline; instead, they flourish after industrial recovery. The reason is that rising prices and low real wages lead to conflicts of interest between labor and management. Therefore, due to rising prices and increased living expenses, the purchasing power of original wages gradually declines, making life difficult. Therefore, workers must demand wage increases from employers for the sake of survival. At the same time, the employer's economic situation may also improve the treatment of its employees. If they are reluctant to give in, labor-management disputes are inevitable.

Causes and Analysis of Disputes

In 1937, a total of 136 labor-management dispute cases occurred, which is the lowest number of dispute cases since 1928. The reasons for this sharp decrease in cases that year can be explained from two aspects. First, the national crisis was severe. Since the second half of 1936, the industrial and commercial sectors suddenly showed a flourishing atmosphere, and labor unrest events changed rapidly, with strikes and work stoppages becoming unstoppable, making the relatively milder disputes insignificant in comparison. Second, with the outbreak of the "August 13th" Incident, Shanghai's industrial heartland was reduced to ashes. During the war of resistance, labor and management endured and lived in peace, so naturally, no dispute events occurred. From August 1937 to the end of the year, only six cases occurred, including three in August (one from before the war), one in September, none in October and November, and two in December. On the other hand, judging from the number of employees and factories involved, the seriousness of the dispute cases in 1937 was greater than in 1936. A total of 1,147 factories and 81,983 employees were involved, which is a higher number than since 1933. This may indicate that during the seven months of 1937, in the context of labor unrest, although not many dispute cases occurred, the cases that did occur had a wider scope of involvement.

The most important causes of labor-management disputes are employment, dismissal, wages, benefits, and collective agreements. In the statistical figures for 1937, there were slight changes in the disputes caused by these incidents, as described below:

First, employment and dismissal have been the main causes of labor-management disputes over the years. Since 1928, the annual average accounted for 65.35% of all cases. Although it was still the top cause in 1937, the percentage of cases decreased sharply to 48.53%. Generally, because this year was a time of industrial and commercial recovery, business was improving, so dismissals naturally did not occur frequently. Among the details under the employment and dismissal category, the average annual number of cases where labor opposed dismissal accounted for 50.68%, but it decreased to 36.76% in 1937. Cases involving business closures decreased from 10.48% to 6.62%.

Second, wage cases in 1937 did not differ much from previous years, accounting for 18.38%.

Third, benefit cases increased the most, accounting for 19.12%, leaping above wage cases. In this year, most factories showed surplus profits, so in addition to disputes over wages, many issues arose regarding improving benefits, bonuses, rewards, promotions, and other related matters. Therefore, benefits became the second most important cause in 1937, second only to employment and dismissal.

Fourth, regarding the implementation of collective agreements, almost no cases occurred after 1933. However, there were four cases in 1937, perhaps because as industry and commerce gradually recovered, some unresolved or delayed labor-management agreements from the past were brought up again. This is an overview of the causes of disputes in 1937.

Next, regarding 1938, there were 27 dispute cases, involving 74 factories and just over 20,000 employees. During the period of labor unrest, the number of factories involved in a year reached more than 4,000, and the number of people reached more than 130,000. The period of the war of resistance cannot be compared to ordinary times.

In the 27 cases in 1938, the issue of employment or dismissal was the most common, with 17 cases. Among them, labor opposed the dismissal of workers in six cases, dismissals due to business closures in six cases, and labor demanded the employment of workers in five cases. Five cases were due to benefit issues, including two cases requesting the issuance of maintenance fees and bonuses. Two cases were due to wage issues, both requesting wage increases.

Analyzing the causes of the disputes, in the 112 dispute cases in 1938, 59 cases were due to wages, accounting for 52.68% of the total, and 31 cases were due to employment or dismissal, accounting for 27.68% of the total. In 1937, there were a total of 100 wage dispute cases, accounting for 33.67% of the total, and 54 employment or dismissal dispute cases, accounting for 18.18% of the total. Therefore, although the situation regarding these two causes of disputes in 1938 was similar to previous years, the trend of concentration was more pronounced than in 1937. By 1939, which was the third year of the war of resistance, Shanghai's population had surged, and industry and commerce had gradually recovered. In addition, foreign exchange rates repeatedly collapsed between June and July, merchants manipulated and hoarded for profit, and prices rose uncontrollably. Industrial and commercial enterprises all made significant profits, while the living conditions of the laboring class became extremely difficult. Disputes over wages and subsidies became inevitable, and the number of strikes and disputes increased.

In 1939, there were 121 strike events, with 74 occurring from July to December, showing the impact of the high cost of living in the second half of the year. A total of 433 factories and 33,433 employees were involved.

Since the cause of labor-management disputes lies in the high cost of living, increases in wages and demands for subsidies and benefits are the main causes of strike events. There were 59 cases regarding labor's request for wage increases, accounting for 48.76% of the total number of cases, which is higher than the average of 27.7% from 1918 to 1938. There were 14 cases requesting improved benefits, including requests for rice subsidies, accounting for 11.57%, which is much higher than the averages of 1.88% and 1.09% from 1918 to 1938. The causes of strikes are concentrated on issues of compensation, with no other complications, which can be seen from this. There were 20 cases regarding employment and dismissal, accounting for 16.52%, compared to the average of only 20.7% in previous years.

In 1939, there were 59 dispute cases that did not lead to strikes or work stoppages, involving 788 factories and 31,073 employees. The cause of the disputes was most frequently related to benefits, with 23 cases, followed by wages with 18 cases. The total losses suffered due to strikes throughout the year amounted to 659,278.52 yuan, with wages accounting for 433,471.33 yuan. Among the 121 strike cases, the most common involved only one factory, accounting for 94.21%. The most common number of employees involved was between 101 and 1,000, accounting for 47.93%. The duration of the strikes was generally between two and ten days, accounting for 51.24%.

As for the labor-management disputes in 1940, the major cases included the strikes by British-owned public bus and tram workers and French-owned tram and bus workers, the seriousness of which was unprecedented in previous years. The details of the public sentiment will be described in another article.

Conclusion

The major labor-management disputes in Shanghai over the past three years of the war of resistance have been described above. Due to the hardship of living conditions, the increase in labor-management disputes seems inevitable. However, we must recognize how our lives have become difficult and who has bestowed this upon us. If we were not invaded, our lives would not be so difficult! Therefore, to stabilize our lives, we must strive for final victory. And in the event of a dispute, we should take the overall situation into consideration and be vigilant against infiltration by evil forces. This is something that both labor and management should pay close attention to.

### Financial Review

— December 14th —

Japan to Change Currency System

Reuters Tokyo reports that because the Bank of Japan is issuing an extremely large amount of paper money daily, the Ministry of Finance will submit a law to the next session of the Diet to amend the Bank of Japan's paper money issuance system. According to the report, although the content is very simple, two points are very clear: (1) Possible regulations, based on the French method from 1870 to 1928, regarding the maximum amount of issuance at the end of each year; (2) Establishment of a total reserve, which includes gold and silver coins, gold and silver bars, government securities, and commercial securities. Whether the Bank of Japan's paper money issuance system will actually be changed in such a magical way cannot be confirmed until the Japanese Diet formally amends it. However, the inability to display Japan's wartime financial finances is undeniable.

The Bank of Japan's issuance reserve system has always been divided into cash reserves and guarantee reserves. The cash reserve includes gold and silver coins and gold and silver bars, while the guarantee reserve includes four categories: public bonds, government securities, securities, and notes. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in August 1937, the government securities item in the guarantee reserve was no longer published, and was in fact hidden under other guarantee items. However, based on a close observation of the reserve contents published by the Bank of Japan since July 1937, the cash reserve was increased to a paper figure of 800 million yuan due to the evaluation of gold, and then reduced to a nominal 500 million yuan. In terms of guarantee reserves, the increase in securities and notes was more than doubled after three years, and public bonds expanded with the increase in the amount issued. Therefore, as far as the published statistics of Japanese currency are concerned, cash and guarantee reserves have long existed in name only, becoming a total public bond reserve. It does not need to be changed to a total reserve fund in the future to be so.

As for saying that the maximum amount of issuance at the end of each year may be stipulated in accordance with the French method, it is also the same way of recognizing the facts. After the war, the guaranteed reserve was expanded again and again from 120 million yen to 220 million yen, and the extra-limit guarantee reserve had already exceeded 100 million yen. Today, the so-called possible regulations for the highest amount of issuance each year will not only expand the issuance of guaranteed reserves, but in fact will try to maximize the amount of issuance. Please take the French method reported in the telegram as an example to illustrate: According to the French Bank of France, the maximum limit for the amount of paper money issued since 1870 has been set by law. Within the limit, the bank is free to adopt a guarantee reserve or even no reserve for the redemption-free paper money issued. If paper money is issued in excess of the statutory maximum limit, a cash reserve is required. Now, because Japan has no cash reserves, it has no choice but to recognize the fact that it will use the French method to stipulate a maximum issuance amount each year with a full guarantee reserve system, which is what I discussed in the past. (Please refer to the Financial Review of November 16, "The Future of Bank of Japan's Issuance")

### Taiwanese Leather Arriving Soon

Taiwanese leather has been lacking in continued arrivals, and market inventories are gradually thinning. It has been found that the firm has already shipped a batch of it, and samples have been seen yesterday. The goods are still relatively dry, but unfortunately the color is not bright red, so the acceptance is relatively sluggish, and the price has not yet been opened, it is said.

### Dutch Granulated Sugar Trending Higher

Although the sugar market was on the weekend yesterday and transactions were not high, the tight trend continued. In particular, the increase in Dutch granulated sugar was more significant. The association's exchange rate, spot goods are 24 for coarse white sugar. The foreign stockade is still 75 yuan. Dutch granulated sugar spot goods are 58 yuan 4 corners. 2 corners, 3 corners, up 6 corners. The 20th of this month’s invoice is 58 yuan 2 corners, up 4 corners. The end of this month’s invoice is 58 yuan 9 corners, up 9 corners. Taikoo car white B mark is 75 yuan, up 2 corners. The end of this month’s invoice is 74 yuan half, up 5 corners. HX mark West stockade is 70 yuan 7 corners, up 5 corners.

### Xiangshan Shrimp Tails Opened in Batches

Western shrimp tails have been affected by the dumping of Eastern goods, and transactions have been sluggish. It was found that the previous market Xiangshan shrimp tail opened at 405 yuan. Yesterday, there were continued sales openings, with the deal being 360 yuan to 340 yuan. The front and rear must have a setback of about fifty-sixty. There are also large and fat ones that are only 190 yuan.

### Pepper Rebounds

Pepper had once been weak in the previous market. For example, Wen Island white pepper opened at 198 yuan, and Dutch white opened at 185 yuan. The current market has rebounded. It is estimated that the deal yesterday for Wen white was 202 yuan, and Dutch white was 190 yuan, an increase of four or five yuan. Black pepper is quite firm. Black large pepper is 103 yuan, and No. 1 is 105 yuan.

### Ordinary White Iron Firm and Expensive

——Ordinary Tie Wire——

Ordinary white iron has recently been in short supply from the factory, and raw materials are also expensive. Therefore, industry insiders have a very firm outlook. The exchange rate has risen but not fallen. Yesterday, the 6-foot goods were still ordinary, while the 7-foot fancy varieties rose by another 2 corners. Yesterday's prices were, for example, 6-foot goods were sold for 8 yuan 3 corners, and 7-foot goods opened at 9 yuan 5 corners.

Tie wire, because the factory in this street has not expanded its capacity, and the outlet to the outside is also rare, so the market situation is not lively, and industry insiders also feel ordinary. The market price has not changed from before, whether good or bad. Yesterday's transactions in the city were only a little over a hundred dan. Each dan was sold for 55 yuan.

### Recent Trends in Polish Wool Fabric

Polish wool fabric has occupied a considerable position in the wool fabric market over the years. It is said that the autumn and winter seasons are more fashionable, because its products are mostly thick goods, such as overcoat fabric, blurred fabric, Melton, and plain thick fabric. Plain thick fabric accounts for a greater advantage, having a heroic appearance that monopolizes the entire city. This is because other countries' products have never been able to be affordable, cheap, special, and beautiful. However, summer goods and thin wool fabrics are still difficult to compete with products from other countries, so the foreign firms that operate Polish wool fabrics also rely only on goods from the autumn and winter seasons. In general, the recent trend of Polish wool fabric is mostly showing a firm and rising trend. According to the trend, after Poland was captured by Germany after the European War, German shipping routes were mostly blockaded by the United Kingdom, resulting in the disappearance of shipments. What is currently being traded in the market is half of the previous inventory and half from transshipments from Singapore and Hong Kong. However, supply and demand are still balanced, because the foreign trade route cannot be loaded, and the ones sold are the lone island. Currently, the original Polish plain thick fabric, the first-grade thick goods, are all sold for 32-33 yuan, the second-grade for 27-28 yuan, the third-grade for 23-24 yuan, the fourth-grade thin fabric plain fabric for 18 yuan, the fifth-grade for 16.5 yuan, Melton for 14 yuan, the first-grade blurred fabric for 13 yuan, the second-grade for 11.5 yuan, the first-grade overcoat fabric for 46 yuan, the second-grade for 38 yuan, the third-grade for 34 yuan, the fourth-grade for 23-25 yuan, the fifth-grade for 20 yuan, and the sixth-grade for 14 yuan.

### Miscellaneous Market of Dried Longans is Sluggish and Not Yet Open

Awaiting Instructions Via Telegram for a Decision

Due to the decline in dried longans coinciding with the fall in chemical goods, the miscellaneous goods market followed suit and became sluggish. Additionally, due to certain reasons, the delivery of goods was unusually slow, further softening the market. Recently, negotiations were held between the trading houses to determine the upper-end price for dried longans, but due to excessive price differences, the cargo owners have been telegraphed for their opinions before a final decision can be made, it is said.

### The Issue of Vehicle Licenses in Western Shanghai: The Public Works Department Closely Monitors the Situation, Engages in Negotiations with the Japanese for Careful Handling; Although Obstacles Have Been Removed, Restrictions Remain Strict

Since the lifting of the blockade in the western Shanghai area the day before yesterday, there has been no change in the situation as of yesterday. However, a large number of notices suddenly appeared on the walls along Yuyuan Road and Great West Road yesterday, announcing that vehicles must pay taxes and obtain licenses. This matter is noteworthy. Although Zhuanbang and other areas have been opened, restrictions remain, and some obstacles have not yet been removed. Details are as follows:

Openly Posting Notices Demanding Tax Collection

Yesterday, "Notices" jointly issued by the "Public Works Bureau, Western Shanghai Vehicle Affairs Branch" and the "Finance Bureau, Western Shanghai Tax Collection Office" suddenly appeared on the walls along Yuyuan Road, Great West Road, and Yidingpan Road. The content roughly stated: "All vehicles passing through this area, whether automobiles, rickshaws, bicycles, horse-drawn carriages, etc., whether for business or private use, must register at No. 92, Lane, opposite Keen Road on Jessfield Road, and then pay vehicle taxes and obtain licenses at this tax collection office in order to comply with regulations. Otherwise, they will not be allowed to travel freely within this area. We now earnestly warn you not to wait and see any longer," and so on. These notices were written in ink with a red seal. However, they did not specify the deadline or the amount of vehicle tax. Nevertheless, they have aroused great concern from all sectors of society, who generally believe that this is an attempt by a certain party to further profit from the opportunity. In addition to submitting a protest to the Japanese side, the concession authorities are now carefully and strictly dealing with the matter. Yesterday, within the area, rickshaws were restricted and could not enter without a "license." Other business automobiles, private automobiles, and bicycles were not yet subject to any obstacles.

How Can Rickshaw Pullers Bear the Burden?

According to the North China Daily News, the municipal police in the Western Shanghai area are prohibiting rickshaw pullers in the Public Concession who have not "registered" with a certain party and paid the "permit" fee from operating in the area. The Public Concession authorities are currently investigating this "ban." Meanwhile, yesterday (the 14th), authoritative sources reported that although the blockade of the Western Shanghai area has been lifted, the municipal police continue to collect "permit fees" from rickshaw pullers entering the extra-settlement roads. According to a "senior official" of the "Police Bureau" in Western Shanghai, although Western Shanghai has been opened and Public Concession buses are also allowed to enter, the "Regulations for Rickshaw Permits in China" must be implemented. The "permit fee" for each rickshaw is 1.25 yuan per month, plus a "registration fee" of 2.19 yuan. Rickshaws with only Public Concession permits and without "permits" issued by the "Chinese authorities" are not allowed to enter the following locations: 1. South of the Robert Dollar Road, Yinghua Lane; 2. The intersection of Connaught Road and Yanping Road; 3. The intersection of Jessfield Road and Edinburgh Road; 4. The intersection of Hart Road and Dijon Road. In the past few days, municipal police have stopped rickshaws near the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Jessfield Road and advised rickshaw pullers to obtain "Chinese permits" from the "Western Shanghai Transportation Office" on Keen Road.

Two Blockades on Great West Road

Yesterday, at the Yuyuan Road intersection west of the Paramount Hotel, two Japanese military police and seven or eight municipal police were stationed with weapons, monitoring passing vehicles. At the intersection of Jing'an Temple and Heping Road, there were only some municipal police. The obstacles at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Great West Road and at the intersection of Yidingpan Road at the southern end of Great West Road have not yet been removed and remain completely blocked. It is unknown when they will be opened. The intention behind the Japanese side's continued blockade of the above locations is also unknown, as it serves no practical purpose. In addition, all roads in Western Shanghai have returned to their original state, and all shops have reopened. However, Zhuanbang on Yidingpan Road, which the Japanese side considers a hideout for "terrorists," is under a semi-blockade. Two Japanese military police are stationed outside the wooden gate, armed and monitoring residents entering and exiting, along with six or seven municipal police conducting inspections. A notice from the "Yuguang Village Military Police Team" is posted on the wall, stating that "the hours for entering and exiting Zhuanbang are limited to 7:00 AM to 8:00 AM for residents exiting and 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM for residents entering; 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM for bringing in goods, and 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM for bringing out goods. All goods brought in or out must be registered and approved before a permit is issued." In addition, Yongxing Lane at the southern end of Zhuanbang has not been opened. At 4:30 PM yesterday, reporters personally saw three Japanese military police inspecting the area with wooden-shell pistols. The other lanes and alleys along Yidingpan Road, such as Zaijia Lane, are allowed to be entered and exited, but are also subject to strict restrictions. Japanese military police are constantly patrolling Yidingpan Road.

Public Buses Not Fully Restored

Yesterday, British-owned public buses had not yet returned to their state before September 30th. Only a portion of Route 1 single-deck buses were running between Jing'an Temple and Zhaofeng Garden. Route 9 terminated at Jing'an Temple, with no buses entering Yuyuan Road. Only half of Route 2 was running between Jing'an Temple and Anhe Temple Road. Therefore, Route 1 and Route 2 both sold tickets in two sections, with Jing'an Temple as the transfer station. However, British-owned Route 20 trolleybuses have returned to their original state, running directly to Zhaofeng Garden. Route 14 buses terminated at Dijon Road on Great West Road due to the closure of the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Great West Road. It is said that all British-owned public bus routes will be restored to their state before September 30th within the day. As yesterday was the second day of the opening, the company authorities adopted this cautious approach.

### Norwegian Merchant Ships: Forbidden to be Leased to Japan; Leases in Effect Will Be Honored Until Expiration

According to recent news obtained by the British shipping industry, a large number of Norwegian merchant ships operate in the Far East. In the future, British and Norwegian shipping will cooperate. Norwegian shipping authorities in London have issued an order prohibiting Norwegian merchant ships from being leased to Japan. Previously leased Norwegian ships will not be allowed to renew their leases upon expiration. In this way, with the cooperation of British and Norwegian shipping and Japan's current shortage of merchant ships, Japan will not only find it difficult to compete with British shipping companies, but will also suffer a significant blow. Under the current circumstances, it is also unlikely that Japan will be able to lease American and Panamanian merchant ships.

### Old Banknotes from Eight Banks: Released for Circulation; Three Banks Responsible for Redemption; Acceptable for Public and Private Payments

When the Legal Tender (Fabi) was implemented, the Ministry of Finance received banknotes from eight banks – Siming, Zhejiang Xingye, China Reclamation, Zhongnan, China Agricultural & Industrial, China General Commercial, etc. – which had been taken over by the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications, and stored in various local bank treasuries. Now, due to a shortage of Fabi, transportation difficulties, and high printing costs, the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications have requested that these banknotes be released for circulation and that they be responsible for their redemption in order to meet the needs and reduce wastage. After review, this is deemed feasible and should be approved. All public and private payments should accept them without discrimination in order to facilitate finance.

### London Jewish Children: Families of Overseas Chinese in Shanghai Face Difficult Living Conditions; Unrest at Sea Makes Travel Uncertain

The children of Jewish refugees residing in London had previously decided to leave the UK for Shanghai due to repeated bombings of London. According to the Far Eastern Jewish Propaganda Bureau, this plan has now been suspended due to unrest at sea, a lack of ships, and extremely precarious living conditions for Jewish refugees in Shanghai.

### Legal Tender Stabilization Fund: Increased by 120 Million; Secured with the Support of the UK and the US; The Only Way to Prevent Exchange Rate Manipulation is to Impose an Embargo on Japan

Following the US loan of 100 million US dollars to China, the UK also loaned 10 million pounds to China. Both the US and UK loans stipulated that half would be used for the Legal Tender (Fabi) stabilization fund and half for China to purchase goods. Half of the US loan, 50 million US dollars, is equivalent to 850 million Fabi based on the open market exchange rate. Half of the UK loan is also equivalent to 300 million Fabi. The UK and US loans used to

maintain the Legal Tender amount to a substantial 1.2 billion. While the Legal Tender is secured with this assistance, how to use it to prevent manipulation and exploitation by the Japanese and their accomplices requires careful prevention by the authorities. A reporter consulted an economist on this matter, who said that the most thorough way to prevent foreign exchange manipulation is for the UK and the US to expand the embargo on Japan.

The embargoed goods should not be limited to military supplies; necessities should also be included. If the embargo is implemented, even if the Japanese scrape together Legal Tender from the occupied areas, they will not be able to purchase goods from the UK and the US due to the embargo, effectively freezing the Legal Tender obtained by the Japanese. At the same time,

shipments of goods to China should be examined to determine whether they are destined for the free areas or the occupied areas in order to determine the standard for acceptance or rejection, so as to prevent the Japanese from using the name of China to obtain materials. This move will not only render the Japanese purpose of collecting Legal Tender ineffective, but will also further damage Japan's economic structure. Since the outbreak of the European War, Japan's foreign trade has been completely dependent on the UK and US groups.

### First Soviet Tea-Loading Ship Arrives in Hong Kong; Three-Fifths of Chinese Tea is Shipped to the Soviet Union

Following the establishment of the 100 million yuan tea agreement between China and the Soviet Union, Chinese tea bricks destined for the Soviet Union will be concentrated for export from Hong Kong, while essential goods shipped from the Soviet Union to China will be transported via the China-Soviet Union Highway. The Soviet authorities have designated cargo ships to

sail exclusively between Vladivostok and Hong Kong. The first ship, the "Tekseeburg," arrived in Hong Kong from Vladivostok without cargo or passengers, carrying only a small amount of ballast. It will load a large amount of tea bricks for shipment to the Soviet Union. It is reported that the tea bricks sold by the Soviet Union to China are divided into red brick tea, green brick tea, and small brick tea, and it is stipulated that red brick tea is 8.5 inches long, 6 inches wide, and weighs 2 pounds, and green brick tea is 8.25 inches long and 2.25 inches wide.

Small brick tea is made from fine powder sifted from red brick tea. It is said that the amount of Chinese tea needed by the Soviet Union accounts for more than 65% of China's tea production, and it is handled by the China Tea Company.

### Extension of Exemption from Import Duty on Foreign Rice is Under Consideration

A telegram from the Ministry of Finance stated: 1. Grains, wheat, and miscellaneous grains originating from within the country should be subject to transit tax as stipulated, but this has been exempted since January 1st of this year.

2. Wheat flour is subject to consolidated tax and is no longer subject to transit tax. 3. Import tariffs on foreign rice were previously exempted for a specified period. The Ministry of Finance is currently considering whether to extend the tax exemption.

### Five Million US Dollars in Aviation Bonds: Oversubscribed by Overseas Chinese; Repaid Within Five Years After the End of the War

Chen Qingyun, a member of the Aviation Commission, was dispatched to the Philippines to proceed to various cities in the United States to comfort overseas Chinese and encourage them to subscribe to aviation bonds. He has already flown from the United States to Hong Kong and returned to the country. It is reported that Chen received a warm welcome from overseas Chinese in various places in the United States, and the total subscription for aviation bonds and free donations amounted to 6 million US dollars. It is heard that the total amount of aviation bonds issued is 5 million US dollars, and the full amount has already been subscribed by overseas Chinese. It has been decided that the bonds will be repaid in installments within five years after the end of the war from the surplus funds obtained from the government's issuance of aviation lottery tickets.

### Financial Industry: Year-End Closing; Business as Usual on January 26

After it was decided that the year-end closing period for the 29th year of the Republic of China would be January 26th, various industries have begun preparations. Since that day falls on a Sunday holiday, the Bankers and Money Changers Association decided yesterday to operate as usual on January 26th for the convenience of the business community. The Money Changers Association will hold a meeting to decide on all issues before and after the year-end closing period, such as the collection and settlement of bills, market discount rates, and holiday dates. It is also reported that in addition to making all preparations, various industries are also seeking ways to adjust their cash positions to get through this year-end. It is reported that the money changers have designated January 27th, 28th, and 29th as the "year-end closing period" and announced a holiday to handle year-end closing matters. Various industries and businesses have designated January 30th for market opening, and banks will also be closed at the same time and reopen after the holiday.

### White Russian Detachment of the Merchant Corps: Subordinate to the Police Department; General Agreement from All Parties; May Be Realized at the Beginning of the Month

The plan to transfer the Public Concession’s White Russian Detachment of the Merchant Corps, consisting of more than 300 men, to the jurisdiction of the Police Department has been under consideration for a long time. According to reliable sources from the Pingming News Agency, the implementation of this plan is likely in the near future, as the authorities of the Public Concession, the headquarters of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, and the Police Department have reached a consensus. The Special Economic Committee of the Public Concession has also concluded that after the White Russian Detachment of the Merchant Corps is transferred to the Police Department, the headquarters of the Merchant Corps can save 1,200 yuan in daily expenses and 14 transport vehicles. The Director-General of the Public Concession, Fessenden, has also suggested that it is appropriate to transfer the detachment to the Police Department. As for the date of implementation of the transfer, according to senior officers of the Merchant Corps, it may be implemented at the beginning of next month, or at the latest by March 1st of next year.

### Savings Deposits: Higher Interest Rates; Four Banks Ordered to Implement

Commercial banks in Shanghai, in view of the abundance of idle funds and the lack of proper investment channels, have generally reduced interest rates to avoid wasting interest. However, the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China have been ordered by their head offices to increase various savings interest rates in order to encourage national savings. The interest rate for small-amount current savings deposits should be increased to 5% in principle, based on the original interest rates. The interest rate for small-amount time savings deposits should be increased by 1% in principle for deposits of one year or more.

### Academic Organizations in the City Hold Public Memorial Service for Zhang Shanzi Yesterday; More Than 300 People Attended the Solemn Ceremony

The painter Mr. Zhang Shanzi was highly skilled in art and renowned throughout the country. He was best known for painting tigers, hence the name "Tiger Obsessed." Since the Incident, Mr. Zhang, with his eyes on the difficult times, rose up and traveled to Europe and the United States to hold solo exhibitions, remitting all the proceeds to the country to help refugees. Countless people benefited. Mr. Zhang's reputation also spread overseas. This summer, Mr. Zhang returned to China, but unfortunately passed away in the wartime capital due to illness. Not only did the art world mourn, but all sectors of the country also expressed their sorrow. Academic organizations in the city and friends of Mr. Zhang held a public memorial service at the Gongdelin on Park Road yesterday morning at 11:00 AM to express their condolences. The image on the left shows the participants.

Solemn and Respectful

The hall was decorated simply and solemnly. In the center hung a portrait of Mr. Zhang sitting leisurely with a fan, his spirit shining brightly, commanding respect. On both sides hung elegiac couplets presented by various circles. On the altar were a bouquet of fresh flowers, clear wine, vegetables, and fruits, and lit white candles. In front of the altar was a wreath from the memorial service participants. Around the walls were displayed more than 40 genuine works by Mr. Zhang, all treasured by his former friends. In addition, there were more than a dozen photographic works by Mr. Zhang and photographs of Mr. Zhang taken by Mr. Lang Jingshan and Mr. Liu Xucang, all priced for charity sale to fund memorial expenses.

Telegrams of Condolence from Chongqing; Unending Stream of Guests; No Fewer Than 300 Attendees, All Notable Figures from the Art and Business Worlds and Old Friends of Mr. Zhang; Academic Organizations Also Sent Representatives to Attend. At 12:00 noon, the public memorial service began. Everyone stood in silence and bowed three times to Mr. Zhang's portrait. Mr. Liu, a relative of Mr. Zhang, personally expressed his gratitude. After the public memorial service, a simple meal and photography were held, ending at 2:00 PM. The memorial service participants sent a telegram to Mr. Zhang's family in Chongqing to express their condolences. The original text was: "To Mr. Zhang Shanzi's family via Chongqing Dagongbao, upon hearing of Shanzi's passing, the art world mourns. We held a public memorial service today to express our admiration and respectfully ask you to restrain your grief."

Memorial Fund

Yesterday, various circles and attending guests generously donated condolence money, reaching more than 1,500 yuan, with many more still sending contributions. The proceeds from the charity sale of Mr. Zhang's photographs amounted to 200 yuan, bringing the total to over 2,000 yuan. The funds are currently temporarily deposited with Mr. Hu Guigeng of Tiger Balm Yong An Tang to form Mr. Zhang's permanent memorial fund. The methods for using the fund may include student loans for impoverished students and Mr. Zhang's art awards, etc. A decision is expected soon.

Angelica and Rhubarb Can Be Freely Transported and Sold

As angelica and rhubarb are essential items for the people in Chinese medicine, they are now allowed to be freely transported and sold in various parts of the rear, without transit restrictions. However, the export of these items should still be subject to foreign exchange requirements, and the transport and sale of these items to the occupied areas and the Shanghai concession areas should be handled in accordance with the regulations on prohibited items and the measures for examining the transport of prohibited items to Shanghai. The Ministry of Finance has telegraphed the customs offices, the Trade Commission, the Central Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications to comply with these regulations.

### American Sympathy

— Hu Shih

Mr. Hu Shih, the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, is working hard for the country overseas, and his speeches have earned the sympathy of the American people for China. Recently, the American Bureau for Medical Aid to China held its third "One Bowl of Rice" national campaign's first dinner dance at the Woldorf Astoria Hotel in New York. More than two thousand people attended, and the enthusiasm was truly inspiring. Dr. Hu gave a very moving speech at this grand event. With a scholar's attitude, he elucidated the true meaning of sympathy, grasping the various underlying factors in the audience and inspiring them to feel compassion. There is no political maneuvering in this speech; we can regard it as an academic paper, and we hope readers will not dismiss it lightly.

We gather here tonight not to commemorate China's war effort, but for the true purpose of expressing the pure and noble sympathy of the American people for China. This sympathy has already been demonstrated in the work of aid organizations to China. The conference held here tonight by the American Bureau for Medical Aid to China and the United China Relief is a continuation of the fervent sympathy of the American people for China. In the past, your organization and others have worked hard, campaigned zealously, and raised huge sums of money to purchase large quantities of medicines and transportation equipment, which have not only benefited the refugees but also indirectly increased China's military strength. This is something that our government, people, and I personally are extremely grateful for.

Three years ago, I traveled from New York to the West, passing through Canada, and my travels inspired many thoughts. The people of Canada and the United States have genuine sympathy for Chinese refugees. Let me tell you some facts as proof. One day, I was eating at a restaurant in Spokane, Washington, and after I finished, a waiter in a white uniform came to me, gave me three silver dollars with a smile, and said, "Mr. Ambassador, this is my small contribution. Please accept it and use it to help Chinese refugees." Isn't this a manifestation of genuine "sympathy"?

A month ago, my neighbor, Mrs. Parmelee, sent a letter with two checks enclosed, totaling one thousand US dollars. One check was for the American Bureau for Medical Aid to China, and the other was for Madame Chiang Kai-shek, asking them to help Chinese refugees. Two days later, I sent her the "Book of Hope" and asked her to sign it. Unfortunately, she passed away that very night. Who knew that her signature would be her last writing? Isn't this a manifestation of genuine "sympathy"?

Recently, it has become fashionable to explain history in terms of economic forces and economic motives. For example, the participation of the United States in the First European War is, according to this school of thought, entirely due to American financial reasons and motives.

Because of this line of thinking and interpretation, many new laws have been enacted to prohibit any warring country, except for those in South America, from receiving financial assistance from the United States, in the belief that the United States would no longer be drawn into foreign wars.

Ladies and gentlemen, these seemingly plausible economic historians have forgotten that everyone's heart still contains "sympathy." The government can legislate to prohibit financial assistance, but the government cannot legislate to eliminate the "sympathy" generated by various factors.

A few weeks ago, The New York Times reported that six thousand American men and women, rich and poor, had donated three thousand bottles of human blood for transfusion to wounded British soldiers and civilians. The report also said that among these six thousand people, women outnumbered men, and some were over fifty years old. How can this action be explained by economic motives? We understand very well that this is entirely driven by "sympathy."

During one of my trips, a young reporter asked me, "What have you discovered during your travels across America?" I said, "What I have discovered is that Americans have one hundred percent sympathy for China." The reporter said, "Dr. Hu, what good is this one hundred percent 'sympathy' for China?" I replied, "Young man, don't underestimate 'sympathy.' Let me tell you now that the fighting spirit of the Chinese is so good because it is driven by your sympathy. It is precisely because of your sympathetic assistance that the suffering of our wounded soldiers and sick civilians has been reduced, and the people have not suffered from hunger and homelessness. Moreover, they have received infinite comfort in their spirits, and in the future, to achieve our freedom and independence, we will still need your 'sympathy' to help us.

Chinese friends, I dare say that the wholehearted efforts of my government and the people of the whole country to fight are worthy of your sympathy. The war has been going on for three years and four months. Although we are fighting for our own survival, we are also helping other countries in the world to remove the entire obstacle to democratic freedom, justice, and righteousness. If Japan were not restrained by our country, the European war would have deteriorated to an unimaginable extent.

Just a year ago, I spoke at the Chinese-American Cooperative Association. At that time, I said that the Sino-Japanese war would not be resolved in a short period because Japan would not be enlightened, would not understand world public opinion, and would not abandon its ambitions and embark on the path of peace. I told you that our entire country is determined to fight and will not stop until the final goal is achieved.

A year has passed, and now I repeat to you once again that China will not stop fighting until its goal is achieved. It may take many more months or even years to reach its goal. China must not stop fighting for the following three reasons:

(1) To give up China's freedom now would be hopeless. The situation in Europe now serves as a lesson to us.

(2) The Munich Conference is a lesson we have learned from the sidelines.

(3) China's victory is a matter of life and death for us and for the world's democracy. If China does not perish, democracy will not perish.

For these three reasons, China should not stop fighting. Finally, I want to say that the final victory will definitely be ours.

### Statistics on Corpses Collected by the Pushan Villa This Year - Summer Has the Most, Coffin Prices Rise

According to the Pushan Villa's announcement, the statistics on corpses collected from January to November this year are quite considerable. "Behind the vermillion gates, meat and wine go to waste, while on the roads, corpses freeze to death." Is this truly the case? Our reporter from the Datong News Agency has recorded the following:

Statistics for This Year

According to the villa's announcement, this year (January) saw the collection of 826 adult corpses and 1,785 children's corpses; (February) 1,017 adult corpses and 1,669 children's corpses; (March) 951 adult corpses and 1,873 children's corpses; (April) 795 adult corpses and 1,515 children's corpses; (May) 665 adult corpses and 1,537 children's corpses; (June) 566 adult corpses and 1,641 children's corpses; (July) 551 adult corpses and 2,298 children's corpses; (August) 576 adult corpses and 2,289 children's corpses; (September) 528 adult corpses and 1,500 children's corpses; (October) 628 adult corpses and 1,549 children's corpses; (November) 715 adult corpses and 1,457 children's corpses.

Recent Collections

The situation for the most recent three days is as follows: on the 13th, 42 adults and 51 children; on the 14th, 22 adults and 58 children. Statistics for yesterday have not yet been released. It is understood that each adult corpse requires a wooden coffin costing around 18 yuan, whereas before the war, it was only worth about 3 yuan. Furthermore, the supply of wood from Fujian and Hangzhou to Shanghai is subject to Japanese control. In a few months, there may be a shortage of wood for making coffins.

### Rickshaw Association Holds Meeting to Discuss Vehicle and Driver Numbers

The Shanghai Rickshaw Pullers' Association held a meeting yesterday afternoon at around 6:00 PM at its headquarters in the Taihe Building. More than 30 people attended, discussing the main issue of the Shanghai Municipal Council's recent notification that each rickshaw should have three drivers rotating shifts, which conflicts with the association's current rules of four drivers per rickshaw. They plan to petition the Municipal Council again not to reduce the number of drivers to avoid increasing unemployment among rickshaw pullers.

### News Briefs

The section of vacant land along the Huangpu River at the Bund Park in the Public Concession, previously leased to Jardine Matheson, with two floating docks built along the riverbank, has been reclaimed by the park due to the expiration of the contract term. All the fences have also been completely removed.

The Cooked Water Store Association has been approved to continue offering coal at a reduced price from December 17th to the 20th, from morning to 12:00 PM each day. The price is 70 yuan per ton in national currency, with each household limited to 1.5 tons (including a supplement of 0.5 tons for the November coal sale). The bathhouse discounted coal sales are also scheduled to begin on the 20th and will last for two days, ending on the 21st. Each household is limited to 4 tons (supplementing 2 tons for November), with each ton priced at 70 yuan in national currency.

The Central Propaganda Department has issued an order stating that all incumbent officials are not allowed to concurrently serve as publishers of newspapers and magazines. If such cases exist, the state should order them to re-elect and report. The provincial party departments should instruct the county governments to handle the matter clearly.

The China Leprosy Relief Association has, in previous years, purchased large quantities of clothing, shoes, woolen sweaters, blankets, books, etc., around Christmas, which are distributed by the general association to local branches to be given to leprosy patients, costing approximately 3,000 yuan. This year, the amount has increased to 5,000 yuan. The association is specifically appealing to all sectors of society to raise donations, temporarily setting a goal of 5,000 yuan. If you have donations or daily necessities, please send them directly to the association's headquarters at 25 Chibin Road. Telephone inquiries are also welcome.

### Japanese National Burns Himself While Drunk

At 2:45 AM yesterday, a fire suddenly broke out at 340 Yangshupu Road, Pudong. The fire brigade was alerted and immediately rushed to the scene to extinguish the fire. Only some household items inside the building were destroyed. It was later learned that the cause of the fire was that a Japanese resident of the building, Mr. A (28 years old), had drunk too much the night before and went to bed drunk. Later, he smoked a cigarette in bed and dropped the cigarette butt onto the bed, causing the bedding to catch fire. At the same time, the Japanese national was still sleeping soundly, so he suffered severe burns to his chest and abdomen. He was later taken to Fumin Hospital for treatment.

### Attempted Theft of Cloth, Lost Footing and Injured

At 7:35 AM yesterday, Lu Shaozhang, also known as Zhuang Xiaosanzi (30 years old), a worker at the Mei Hua Printing and Dyeing Factory at 640 Hejian Road, Yangshupu, suddenly had a wicked idea and climbed over the wall into the dyeing room. In the dark, he stole two pieces of undyed serge cloth and carried the loot out by climbing over the roof. However, when he climbed onto the roof of the coppersmith's shop, the roof there was made of lead sheets, which had been rusted by wind and rain. Because it could not withstand the weight and pressure, it suddenly burst, causing Lu to fall through the lead sheet hole into the coppersmith's shop, injuring his head, chest, hands, and feet. He groaned incessantly, but because it was late at night, no one noticed. It was not until dawn that he was discovered by other workers, who reported it to the factory management, who in turn reported it to the police and summoned an ambulance at 7:35 AM to take him to Hudong Hospital for treatment. It is said that Lu's injuries are very serious.

### Police Translator Zhao Anda Steals Police Constable's Handgun, Sentenced to Eight Months, Suspended for Two Years

Martin, the Western constable of the Jiaxing Road Police Station, hung his official handgun, along with its holster, in the police station office on the evening of the 18th of last month. Unexpectedly, the next morning, the handgun disappeared. At that time, the police station authorities believed that since outsiders could not arbitrarily enter and exit the office, it must have been done by someone from within the police station. They suspected two coolies, Zhao Yuqin from Anhui and Fu Jiaxi from Nanjing, and detained them and sent them to the First Special Court, requesting an extension of the investigation. Later, the Xinzha Patrol Team arrested Zhao Anda (19 years old, from Nanjing, working as a translator at the Jiaxing Road Police Station; his father is also a detective at the police station) in Chengdu Road. They recovered the stolen handgun and six bullets, and escorted him to the Jiaxing Road Police Station for investigation. It was found that Zhao and Fu were not involved in the handgun theft case and were not prosecuted. Zhao Anda was sent to the First Special Court, Criminal Division Four, and prosecuted for theft. Judge Meng heard the case. The defendant, Zhao Anda, confessed that the handgun theft was a solitary act and that there were no other accomplices. The handgun was initially hidden at 3, Guling Road. Later, he took it to Western Shanghai to sell it, but because the price was not right, he took it back to his residence. Unfortunately, he was arrested at 741 Chengdu Road. He asked the court to give him a chance to reform himself according to the law. The court concluded the trial and handed down a judgment a few days ago. Zhao Anda was sentenced to eight months for theft, with a two-year suspended sentence.

### Robbery at Mantingfang, One Thief Captured, Passerby Wounded by Stray Bullet

Two robbers broke into the Mantingfang Dim Sum Shop at 389 Shanglin Street, Wuma Road, at 11:30 PM last night, brandishing guns and attempting to rob the place. At that time, the owner, upon seeing the situation, immediately shouted to catch the thieves. Nearby Chinese constables heard the alarm and went to arrest them. The robbers, seeing the police arriving, did not have time to steal anything and fled, opening fire to resist arrest. The Chinese constables also drew their guns and returned fire. Both sides exchanged multiple shots, resulting in the thief Zhou Jinsheng being shot twice in the right leg. The wounded thief fell to the ground and was captured, while the other robber escaped without a trace. At the time, a passerby, Wu Akang, 35 years old, a local, was wounded in the waist by a stray bullet. The police summoned an ambulance and sent Wu to Renji Hospital. The thief Zhou Jinsheng was sent to the Police Hospital for treatment.

### The Owner of a Sauce Garden in Hongkou Was Arrested and Then Released, the Arresting People Were Riding in a Dai-Named Car, and According to His Confession, He Was Taken to the Japanese Military Under Surname For Questioning

According to a report from the News Agency, at 7:15 AM yesterday, a black-plated car No. 3794 suddenly arrived at the entrance of Xindefeng Sauce Garden and Winery at 137 Yuanfang Road, Hongkou. After the car stopped, a Japanese person and two Chinese people jumped out and went straight into the shop, asking if the shop's manager, Shi Fuyuan, was there. Shi happened to be inside the counter and stepped out, nodding in affirmation. Unexpectedly, the people suddenly pulled out handcuffs, handcuffed Shi's hands, pushed him into the car, and drove away quickly. Subsequently, the Public Concession Police received a report and immediately sent officers to investigate the truth. After investigation, it was found that the car used by the people belonged to Dai Buxiang, the manager of the Dazhonghua Hotel at the intersection of Yuqiaqing Road and Fuzhou Road. Just as they were about to send officers to investigate further, they suddenly received a report that Shi had been released and returned to the shop, so they terminated the investigation. They immediately summoned Shi to inquire about what happened. According to Shi, he only said that after being arrested, he was taken to the Japanese Military Headquarters and questioned once. Because there was no suspicion of any wrongdoing, he was immediately released. It is reported that Shi is from Ningbo, is currently 40 years old, and has been the manager of the shop for a long time.

### Shenbao Cup China-America Charity Basketball - American Team Roster Announced - The Whole Team Is Based On the MacLeish Cadre

The fourth Shenbao Cup China-America Charity Basketball Championship will kick off tomorrow night at 8:00 PM at the YMCA basketball court on Jing'an Temple Road. This year, the Chinese team has assembled the elite of Chinese basketball to form an iron army, with the absolute determination to win back the lost championship. The official ideal lineup of the Chinese team has already shown signs after the probing battle the night before. The strength of the American team has also been tested. Tomorrow night's dramatic battle will be exciting and tense, unprecedented this season. Because the YMCA's venue is extremely small, the number of tickets is severely limited. There are 317 seats downstairs and 410 seats upstairs. To prevent excessive crowding, ticket prices have been slightly increased: 5 yuan downstairs and 3 yuan upstairs. Pre-sales began yesterday. Because the number of tickets is extremely small, buyers are scrambling to buy them, not wanting to miss out. Pre-sales will continue today at the Shenbao office on Hankou Road and the YMCA on Jing'an Temple Road. There are not many left. Those who want to buy them should do so as soon as possible. The American team's roster was announced yesterday, totaling 12 people, mostly MacLeish officers and MacWhite team members. The list is as follows: Carter Janak (YMCA), Roach, Stock, Simpson, Henshawitz (MacLeish officers), Mayhan, Water, Jenkins, Dingwall, Smith, Murtle (MacWhite).

### YMCA Basketball Opens Tonight - Paramount Takes On Shanghai Bank - MacLeish Red and MacLeish White Brothers Compete

The 13th YMCA Invitational Basketball Tournament is limited to Group A this year. The Youlian and Guanghua University's Blue team withdrew temporarily, leaving only 10 teams to compete. Chinese teams include Paramount, Huaxing, Liangxi, Shanghai Bank, and Shangxing. Western teams are MacLeish White, Red, Officers, and YMCA Cubs and Giants. The opening game will be held tonight at 7:15 PM at the YMCA gymnasium on Jing'an Temple Road. The first game is Shangxing vs. Paramount. Shangxing has Sun Huipai helping out, but a single tree is unlikely to support a large building. Paramount is the defending champion. Although Li Zhenzhong and Bao Songyuan have left, Zhou Yaokang, Lu Gusui, and others have joined, which can be said to be a loss in one area and a gain in another. It is predicted that Shangxing will inevitably suffer at their hands. The second game is the MacLeish White and Red brothers playing against each other at 8:15 PM. MacLeish Red is weaker because their strong players have left. Tickets are divided into two types: 1 yuan upstairs and 2 yuan downstairs. The order and list are as follows:

Shangxing Team - Paramount 7:15 PM

MacLeish Team - MacLeish Red 8:15 PM

(Shangxing) Sun Huipai, Ye Zuyao, Li Wenru, Zhou Zhixin, Zhou Jun, Zhuang Kunpeng, Zhou Huaibang, Pan Jianhua, Wang Wanchun, Fang Wanchun, Wang Jingshen, Xu Wenbin.

The third Silver Dollar Cup Team Table Tennis Championship final match took place at the Money Trade Association hall at 7 PM the night before last. China Reserve faced Zhejiang Xing, drawing a crowd of over 700, creating a lively atmosphere. The event began with Fu Guiqing reporting on the cup competition's progress, followed by speeches from Pu Jiqing, Wang Meifeng, and Xu Duo. The competition then commenced, starting with the team final. China Reserve demonstrated superior strength, with excellent performances from players like Zhang Decai, Gu Jinxiang, and the rising star Wang Yongjin, consistently leading. Zhejiang Xing, while not lacking talent, appeared diminished in performance that night. Key players Zhu Xuejing and Wu Zhaofeng failed to secure even a single point, a major factor in their defeat. Ultimately, China Reserve triumphed over Zhejiang Xing with a score of 13 to 3, winning the championship. Following this was the individual final, where Zhang Decai of China Reserve, with his outstanding chop strokes, defeated Zhang Zhihong of Guangdong with a score of 2 to 0, claiming the individual championship.

### Catholic Church's Five Major Cultural Undertakings in China – Overview (VII) (5) The Musée Hoang-Ho Pai-Ho (Northern Frontier Museum)

The Musée Hoang-Ho Pai-Ho (Northern Frontier Museum), abbreviated as H.H.P.H., is a museum encompassing geology, paleontology, botany, zoology, and ethnology. However, its collection area is limited to North China.

The founder of this museum is the famous Jesuit priest, P. Licent. As far as we know, he even served as a guest advisor for the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce of China for a time. He has been in China for 27 years, having visited various provinces in North China and Mongol leagues and banners. Recently, he even took his collection of insect and plant specimens to France for identification because several newly discovered species have not yet been named.

Besides the director, Father Licent, Father P. Teillard de Chardin has contributed the most to the Northern Frontier Museum. Although Father Teillard de Chardin serves in China, he holds a position at the Geological Survey Institute in Beiping. At the same time, he is the president of the French Geological Society. In 1929, when "Peking Man" was discovered at Zhoukoudian near Fangshan, southwest of Beiping, he went to investigate and conduct detailed research, confirming that it belonged to the same category as Heidelberg Man. Father Teillard de Chardin's name has thus attracted the attention of academic circles in China.

In addition to the two Fathers Licent, others at the Northern Frontier Museum engaged in scientific research include botanist Father Roi, mineralogist Father Trasert, and zoologist Father Leroy, who came to China in August of the year before last.

If we want to know about the geology of the Yellow River basin, we must consult them. The work of the Northern Frontier Museum has now become an affiliated institution of the Tianjin Institut des Hautes Études Industrielles et Commerciales. This is, of course, very beneficial for students' research. (End)

### A Discussion on Two Congees and One Meal

— Qiu Lang

Recently, I saw in the newspapers that a certain school has initiated a change in daily meals to one congee, one rice, and one noodle dish, and other schools have followed suit. This certainly saves a lot of rice for schools with a large number of students. However, the price of flour is also very expensive now. We occasionally eat a few meals of noodles and find the taste to be very good, but eating noodles all the time can become tiresome. Moreover, Southerners are accustomed to eating rice, and Northerners are accustomed to eating wheat. Some people here simply cannot get used to eating noodles.

According to previous legends, ordinary families originally only had two meals a day (wealthy families and farmers were exceptions). I don't know when it changed to three meals a day. However, habit becomes nature, and it may not be possible to reduce three meals to two in reality. However, in this extraordinary period, "frugality and economizing on food and clothing" is something that everyone should follow. Now is the time to endure hardship. How can we compare ourselves to peacetime? Ask the pitiful refugees, have they ever had two balanced meals? Even pampered students cannot be as willful and indulgent as they used to be but should prioritize thrift and hardship (the author still remembers when students at the university would throw bowls and plates because the meals were not good). At the same time, I implore the school authorities to consider all the students in the school. If the majority are Southerners, they may as well change to two congees and one meal a day. The distribution is: eat congee for breakfast and dinner, and rice for lunch. Because the time between breakfast and lunch is shorter, eating congee is enough to satisfy hunger (some people eat a little dim sum for breakfast and get by). The time between lunch and dinner is longer, so lunch is called a "waist-supporting meal" and cannot be saved. When eating congee for dinner, it won't make you feel hungry because you will go to sleep soon after eating. In terms of economy, it is still worthwhile because one bowl of rice can be turned into at least two bowls of congee, and the expensive flour is not much cheaper to eat (just look at the fact that each set of fritters and fried dough sticks has risen to one dime). Therefore, the author offers this humble opinion, not only for schools, but also for general families on the isolated island, factories, and other places, which may as well follow suit to comply with the "economic principle of reducing food."

### Attention Wearers of Western Suits

— Li Dun

It is always appropriate to dress in accordance with one's status. One should never try to dazzle people with their attire. Those who can afford to wear a smart Western suit are probably in the upper-middle class. However, there are many things to pay attention to when wearing a Western suit, and one should never be careless. If one is careless in some aspect, one may be considered to be a member of a so-called "outlandish" group. Therefore, I will write down the points to pay attention to, hoping that all gentlemen who wear Western suits will pay attention to them.

(1) Do not forget to fasten the trousers buttons. (2) The sleeves should not be folded back. When working in the office, two black cloth sleeves can be used instead. (3) Hats should be worn straight and level, or slightly forward, and should not be tilted back or to the left or right. (4) Hats with a brim should be worn with the seam of the brim on the left side. (5) Leather shoes should be brushed clean often, and mud should not be allowed to stick to them. (6) Do not make loud noises when walking on the floor. (7) Do not put both hands in your pockets or chest, etc. (8) Always wear a tie. (9) Collars made of velvet or fur are for women, patients, and the elderly, and young people should not overuse them. (10) A Western-style top and Chinese-style bottoms, or a Chinese-style top and Western-style bottoms, are the most inappropriate and should be avoided.

### Talking About Hot Pot Lamb

— Guo Yi

Lamb has been considered a delicacy since ancient times, so those who created characters used "beauty," "soup," "shame," and "fresh" in relation to lamb. However, Southerners often dislike lamb and hate its muttony smell. In the past, when I traveled to the old capital, I ate at lamb restaurants every meal because they were cheap and palatable. I would eat with one or two friends, get drunk and full, and return home. The cost was never more than two yuan (this refers to ten years ago; with today's high cost of living, it must be more than that). Many of the restaurants in the north belong to the Muslim faith. The signs of lamb restaurants are almost everywhere. Those who are not Muslim are commonly called "Da Jiao Guan" (Big Teaching Hall), and they prominently write the words "Pork Restaurant" to distinguish themselves. If you don't know the local customs, you will find the words "Pork Restaurant" strange at first glance. However, gourmets often don't like to go to pork restaurants (pork restaurants also sell lamb), saying that they are not as clean as lamb restaurants. I don't have a particular fondness for lamb. In fact, there is nothing else to eat in the north that can be served with meals besides lamb. Moreover, the "big-tailed sheep" produced in the north has meat that is not muttony and is different from the sheep in the southern provinces. Therefore, hot pot lamb is considered the ultimate delicacy. Hot pot lamb in Peiping is a staple in every household except in the summer. (Grilled lamb is also available in August and September.) It can be eaten repeatedly without getting tired of it. In recent years, I have lived in Shanghai. Due to frequent entertainment, I only think of hot pot lamb in very cold weather. When I occasionally try it, this is because there are few lamb that are not muttony in this area. The other day, Wang Weiwo invited me to drink at the Yuanxing Restaurant on Ma Huo Road, a genuine Muslim restaurant. The food was very rich, and the meat was not muttony. The hot pot lamb was so tender that it was not much different from the big-tailed sheep. When I asked the waiter, he replied that the sheep was produced in Huzhou. The sheep in Huzhou may be slightly inferior to the big-tailed sheep, but in the south, it is already rare to find. The other dishes at Yuanxing Restaurant, such as "Pan-fried Lamb Chops," "Braised Lamb Strips," "Stewed Lamb," and "Dry Fried Chicken," also have special characteristics. The excellence of the chefs and the thoughtful service always make people recall the flavors of the old capital.

### One Week Economic Menu

— Ms. Hua Ying

In the previous issues of this magazine, the special issue on capital menus could not be published on time. From this issue onwards, the special issue is temporarily concluded, so the author is here again to serve the readers. In the past two months, the cost of living has continued to increase. How can we talk about economy? The price of each stone of national rice has broken the 100-yuan mark. Those heinous rice weevils sharpen their teeth and suck blood, making unjust gains every day and feeling very proud. They don't know that the common people of thousands of households are heartbroken and weeping! Under such circumstances, even eating plain rice is not economical. How can we even talk about economy when we have to use firewood, coal, oil, salt, soy sauce, vinegar to cook vegetables? But how can we eat plain rice without vegetables? Therefore, the author can only do her best and continue to prepare this menu of two meat and two vegetarian dishes per day, and let the readers stretch themselves as much as they can.

### Three Things After Sleeping

— Ai Nong

The other day, this magazine published Tian Qingjun's great work, "A Few Things Before Going to Bed," which immediately caught the author's attention. I have been following it, but the work after sleeping has not been mentioned. The following three things are what the author must do after sleeping. It has been almost three years, and it has unconsciously become a habit. If one is forgotten, then it feels very uncomfortable. Now I offer it to the gentlemen who do not yet have this habit. If you can start doing it from today, then after a considerable period of time, there will be unexpected results.

(1) Wash your nose: Washing your face and gargling in the morning is essential, but before washing your face, fill a basin with water, preferably cold water, then immerse your nose in the water and gently suck in the water. Do not use too much force, so that the cold water is sucked into just the right part of the nose, then you will not feel uncomfortable. Then spray the water out. Do this sucking and spraying, spraying and sucking many times, and you will feel that your nose seems to be exceptionally clear. The nose is a very important organ on the human body. We are constantly passing air through our nostrils to our lungs. However, the air is always mixed with dust, and sometimes germs are mixed in with the dust, which is so dangerous. Fortunately, there are nose hairs in the nostrils, which prevent the entry of dust, and they stay in the nostrils. If they are not removed, then they will be dirty and unbearable, so you must wash them away with water to keep the nose clean, which is as important as washing your face and gargling every day. Washing the nose also has a clever side effect, which is that once you get a cold (flu), the nose seems to be blocked. If you wash your nose with cold water every day, you can not only prevent the spread of colds, but if you are unfortunate enough to have one, you can also make the nostrils not feel blocked and as clear as usual, but there is some difference in the throat.

(2) Wash your face with cold water. Generally, people always like to wash their face with hot water, but washing your face with cold water has many benefits. In addition to saving fuel, it can also prevent the spread of influenza because the face is in contact with cold water every day. Of course, cold water is more stimulating than hot water. If you are not careful and feel some cold, it does not matter because the resistance of the face is increased by frequent stimulation with cold water, so you do not care about some cold. If you take a cold bath, that is even better.

(3) Drink a cup of salt water. After washing your face and gargling, drink a cup of salt water while your stomach is empty. Although the effect is not very great, it is not small either. Because table salt has antiseptic properties, drinking some salt water is also effective if your throat is dry or inflamed. When the stomach is empty, it can cleanse the stomach and intestines because the food eaten overnight has all been digested after one night, but some residue always remains in the stomach and intestines. If it is not removed, it will rot. Drinking some salt water down can make the stomach and intestines clean immediately.

These above three things must be done with perseverance, every day, every month, every year, then you will not have to consult a doctor.

### The Origin of Road Names

— Chou

I happened to read "Police Voice Monthly," which had an article that described in detail the origin of the names of Nanjing Road, Zhengfeng Street, and Stone Road in this city, which is something that local people should know. Therefore, I have specially recorded it here to send to this magazine.

Nanjing Road: When the capital of China was in Peiping and the most perfect main road in the British Concession was named Nanjing Road, Peking Road was placed behind it. Was it intended to distinguish between the north and south directions, or was it because Nanjing Road was the capital of this province and it was honored as a giant? In fact, it is not entirely true. Sino-British trade was based on the Treaty of Nanjing of the Renyin Year of Daoguang, which is also known as the Treaty of Five Ports. At the beginning of the establishment of the port, this road was the starting point, so it was named after Nanjing.

Zhengfeng Street: Zhengfeng Street is another name for Guangdong Road. When examining the origin of its name, there was a soy sauce garden named Zhengfeng, which was opened in the middle section of the road. Over the years, it has been called by that name.

Stone Road: Fujian Road in the Public Concession is commonly known as Stone Road. When examining the origin of its name, it is said that during the Daoguang years, there was a wealthy man named Li in the east of the county government in Shanghai City, who married his daughter to the Qu family in Zhabei. The Li family prepared a large dowry for his daughter to marry into the Qu family. Because the fields outside the city gate were vertical and horizontal and the roads were rugged, the Li family prepared thousands of large stones. Starting from the river bank (Yangjing Bridge), they placed a stone every foot to the Wusong River to benefit pedestrians. Afterward, pedestrians found it convenient, so it was named Stone Road.

### Monk

— Shuying

Now is not the time for "valuing men over women." Now should be "gender equality."

Therefore, after reading Ren Jiongjun's "Story of the Nunnery" in the ninth issue of this magazine, I couldn't help but speak out on behalf of us women (although this is a "story").

Because we cannot think that by sending all women into nunneries, they will "never" have children; men outside will still "tempt" them! Although it is said that "nuns" having abortions is "justified" because they have not been "married"! However, it is still not "elegant"! My opinion is: in addition to "promoting the establishment of more nunneries, we must also have a "National Monk Movement"! This is the only way to eliminate all "irregular" actions so that the nuns can "practice Buddhism in peace," avoiding "married women are exceptions" and other "exceptional" absurdities!

However, those gentlemen who advocate kicking married women out can avoid being monks because they themselves will not do things that slap themselves in the face by "making" nuns into "married women"!

However, there is also a "difficulty": what if monks and nuns also "do that thing"?

I also have a "solution": "Married nuns are also an exception!" (Forgive me! Forgive me!)

### No Private Disputes Allowed Without Public Arbitration

— Chen Haoxiong

### The School Changed "New Books"

— Li Song

Some time ago, I heard that my nephew's school was going to move and that it would be very far from home, which made me worried - such as the dangers on the road, the cold winter weather. It was indeed difficult for my young nephew to go to school so far away. But later, the school decided not to move, which made everyone in the family happy, thinking that it would be much more reassuring to study at a nearby school.

The day before yesterday afternoon, my nephew came home from school as usual, and I had to urge him to review his homework, but when he walked up to me carrying his schoolbag, he looked frightened and stuttered, "The teacher took the books away." I was very surprised, and I quickly opened his schoolbag and looked inside. Sure enough, there were only a few exercise books left, and not a single textbook. I thought that perhaps he had committed a punishment at school, and the books were taken away as a warning, and they would be returned the next day. So I asked him what he had done and blamed him for not following the rules at school. But after asking, I wronged my young nephew; he had not committed anything. He told me, "Today in class, the teacher told us to take out all the textbooks and put them on the corner of the desk. The teacher took them away one by one and said that this was an "order" to take them away and that new books would be issued to us tomorrow and that we would not have to pay for them." My nephew seemed to be a little proud when he said this. The children were happy to have new books to read and the parents would not have to spend any money, but I was a little skeptical: changing books in the middle of the year naturally had other intentions. Will the children's studies be affected by this?

Sure enough, the facts came. When school was dismissed at noon the next day, my nephew jumped and brought the new books that the school had exchanged and handed them to me to look at. The first thing that caught my eye was "National Elementary School Textbooks," and the "color" was a little different. After carefully flipping through them, I saw that the contents of the arithmetic book had not changed at all, and it was completely reprinted from the previous book. The knowledge book was full of flowers, trees, and trees, and the brief history of the founding of the country, the origins of commemorative days, and so on were gone. The most shocking thing was the language book, in which I found many "ridiculous" sentences.

A child's brain is a blank sheet of paper, and he cannot be allowed to get stained with stains. "What is going on?" My second brother said lightly, "×× is a middle school attached to a university, and the reputation of the elementary school is quite good. The school authorities will naturally take appropriate measures. There is no need to worry now, and we will wait until the winter vacation. But we must also forgive the school for its situation. It is difficult to find a school building at the moment. Fortunately, the school has always been famous and will certainly not fail the children and their parents!"

The school's situation, being a student's parents...

### Willow of Zhang Terrace

— Gu Mingdao

Liu Rushi, from within the sedan, promptly replied, "Someone is behaving improperly; please help!" The dark figure rushed over, revealing a burly man who stretched out his iron arms and struck the ruffians. Zhao Qi launched a kick, aiming for the man's kidneys, but the man caught it with one hand and threw him sprawling. Only then did the ruffians realize the man's strength and quickly helped Zhao Qi as they scurried away like rats. Liu Rushi leaned out of the sedan, recognizing the man as the Iron Beggar, Shi Da. Overjoyed, she called out, "Brave Shi!" Shi Da walked over and said, "Who could it be? It's actually Miss Liu. I was just returning from Wu Family Dam when I heard the commotion here, thinking it was robbers, so I came to help. What a coincidence! Those ruffians are truly detestable, but they're no match for me. Don't be alarmed, Miss. Where are you coming from?" Liu Rushi then told him everything and thanked him profusely. Shi Da said, "It's late. Let me escort you home." Liu Rushi thanked him again, and the sedan bearers immediately lifted the sedan and hurried along. With Shi Da guarding her from behind, her heart felt no fear. Arriving at the Liu family gate, Shi Da bid farewell. Liu Rushi insisted that Shi Da come tomorrow for drinks to thank him for his kind assistance. Shi Da readily agreed and strode away. After Liu Rushi returned home, she told her sister and Aunt Xu about the incident, and they were all delighted. The next day, Liu Rushi finished her toilette when she noticed a poem by Zhang Tianru held down by a jade lion paperweight on her desk. She picked it up and read it, her delicate brows furrowing slightly as she sighed softly, "Teacher, I admire your talent, and I appreciate your earnest instruction, which has helped me improve in my studies. However, to ask me, Liu Rushi, to serve you as a wife is something difficult to achieve. In truth, my heart already belongs to Chen Wuzi. His unrestrained talent is what I admire in my heart, and his aloof nature is especially what I value. Alas, Teacher, Teacher, I must disappoint your deep affection." She then grasped her soft brush and composed a poem, subtly expressing that she could not comply with Tianru's wishes and thanking him for his affection. She wrote it with great tact, then had her foster mother, Aunt Xu, cook two dishes and send them along with the poem to Zhang Tianru's home. In the afternoon, Shi Da arrived. Liu Rushi led him to the outer room of the upper floor, where she prepared fine wine and invited him to drink. Shi Da did not stand on ceremony and drank from large bowls. Rushi sat beside him, chatting with him. Listening to his words, she found him to be very ambitious. Rushi seized the opportunity to encourage him. Hearing Liu Rushi's words, Shi Da drank while surveying his surroundings and sighed, "Heaven has endowed me with a body of bronze muscles and iron bones, which should be used to serve the country far and wide. Alas, I have not encountered someone who recognizes my worth, and I am reduced to poverty. Unwilling to serve others obsequiously, I have hidden myself among beggars. It is rare for Miss Liu to understand me, which makes me very happy. From now on, I am willing to invigorate my spirit and serve the country, as long as there is a path forward." Liu Rushi listened and nodded, her mind occupied with a matter. She then saw Aunt Xu hurrying up the stairs, saying, "Two guests have arrived." Liu Rushi was about to ask who they were when she heard the sound of footsteps on the stairs. The two guests had already ascended.
