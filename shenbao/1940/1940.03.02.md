### Japanese Restrictions on North China's Export of Local Products

Tianjin: The export of animal hides and furs from North China is now subject to another layer of Japanese restrictions, namely, prior approval from the Japanese military authorities is required before shipment. Previously, merchants exporting furs and hides to the United States via parcel post had to obtain approval from the Yokohama Specie Bank and the Japanese Consulate in Tianjin. However, now an additional restriction has been added. However, when local leather and fur exporters today sought export permits from the Japanese military authorities, the Japanese military claimed that they were not yet ready to issue such permits. However, the Japanese military can send people to the post office to inspect packages awaiting shipment. It is reported that today, there are one hundred packages of leather goods awaiting shipment to the United States piled up in the General Post Office here, all awaiting inspection by the Japanese. However, the Japanese army has not sent anyone to inspect them, so they cannot be shipped. Exporters are feeling extremely anxious about this, and are afraid that if the goods are not allowed to be shipped, they will not be able to be transported back to the French Concession, as the General Post Office is located near the Japanese-controlled area, so the Japanese can arbitrarily interfere.

### Anti-War Sentiment Among Japanese Troops Increasingly Widespread

Yingde: Anti-war sentiment is intensifying among Japanese troops in various places. On February 8th, the Fukuyama unit of the Japanese army in Guangzhou disobeyed orders and moved independently, occupying the Japanese army hospital for wounded soldiers at the Qianyan Tang Military Academy, which was a secret organization of the Anti-War League of Japanese Soldiers. The Japanese military police cracked the case, seized a large number of anti-war propaganda materials, and arrested two anti-war leaders, who were executed on the spot. As a result, all the wounded Japanese soldiers in the hospital went on a hunger strike, and the Japanese commander Ando was unable to take any measures. Upon hearing the news, the Japanese Imperial Headquarters in Tokyo urgently dispatched Prince Chichibu to Guangzhou on February 16th to appease the troops, but to no avail. Now the situation is escalating, and anti-war sentiment is brewing among Japanese troops in Nanning, Hainan Island, Shantou, and other places. Prince Chichibu also flew to inspect the situation, but was unable to resolve it. (1st Telegram)

### A Glimpse of the Suiyuan Western Front

Suiyuan West: A reporter telegraphed back from the front line on the evening of the 28th. Passing through Linhe, Shanba, Huangyangmutou, and other places, he witnessed the burning, killing, looting, and plunder by the Japanese, and the post-disaster situation was extremely tragic. In the above places, nine out of ten houses were empty, and they had all been turned into rubble. Among them, the burning and killing in the Catholic Church of Sandaohe and the villages of Ulan淖, etc., were the most severe and unbearable to witness. On the 16th and 17th, Japanese aircraft released poison gas in Linhe and Huangyangmutou, causing the death and injury of many women and children. Later, they scattered blistering gas near Wuzhen, causing fewer deaths. The remaining Japanese troops entrenched in Wuyuan are now very few in number. The Chinese army has advanced to the vicinity of Wuyuan, trapping the Japanese in a heavy siege, and cutting off the transportation routes east of Wuyuan, making it easy to wipe them out in one fell swoop.

### Discussion on the Issue of the Shanghai Municipal Council Increasing Surtaxes

At a time when prices are soaring, Shanghai residents are struggling with difficult living conditions. They fervently hope that someone will come forward to adjust the market and stabilize prices, so as to alleviate their burdens and ease their suffering. Unexpectedly, the result of the Shanghai Municipal Council's budget for this year is that, due to financial exhaustion, there is an increase of 50% in surtaxes. This will be used as collateral to borrow ten million yuan from the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation to make up for the deficit. It is claimed that if the surtax is not increased, the Municipal Council's budget deficit will become even larger, thus demonstrating their determination to increase the surtax. Whether this proposal passes or not rests in the hands of the foreign ratepayers at the annual meeting. The Chinese ratepayers, on the other hand, will not make a formal criticism until after holding a special meeting to study the matter closely. However, the public's sentiments are boiling, as reported in the newspapers, which is also indicative of public opinion. Therefore, it is still impossible to predict whether there is any room for change in this proposal at the meeting, or whether the Municipal Council will consider the rare suffering currently experienced by the majority of taxpayers in their lives, and conduct a thorough review of financial, social, and livelihood aspects, and devise a mutually beneficial strategy.

But why is the Municipal Council's deficit so large? Analyzing the budget, salaries, pensions, and subsidies account for 69% of the expenditure. This is because its income is all based on legal tender (fapi), while a portion of the salaries are calculated in foreign currency. For example, a monthly salary of £250, which before the war was equivalent to over 4,200 fapi, now has to be paid over 13,700 fapi. The difference is a ratio of one to three, meaning that the Municipal Council's expenditure on this has suddenly increased by two-thirds. In addition to exchange rate issues, the Municipal Council also has increased expenditure due to high prices and the provision of additional subsidies. However, for Chinese staff with monthly salaries below one hundred yuan who do not receive meal subsidies from the Bureau, the rice subsidy is at most seven yuan. Even in the last two months, when the price of rice was around fifty yuan, each person only received a rice subsidy of seven yuan and four cents. Therefore, although the Bureau's expenses have also increased for Chinese staff, the significant impact is due to foreign staff. The reality is such that it does not involve the issue of discrimination between Chinese and foreigners, but an objective analysis yields this result, so those studying finance should not ignore it.

To assume that Shanghai's superficial prosperity is proof of its ability to bear a large amount of taxes is not only oblivious to the actual situation and ignores the crisis, but also seems to fail to recognize the final bearers of the burden of taxes that are passed down through various layers. In other words, the bearers are definitely not those who enjoy and profit from prosperity. Generally increasing the surtax by 50% will ultimately result in the majority of the wage-earning class bearing the burden. Today's wage-earning class is already suffering from high prices and soaring rents. Their lives have been reduced as much as possible and saved as much as possible. That is to say, the burden is already heavy and cannot be increased further. In terms of house tax, the large landlords can pass it on to the second and third tenants; in terms of land tax, the owners can pass it on to the renters. This kind of theory is simple and easy to understand, so there is no need to elaborate further. It seems fair and balanced to increase the general burden through all kinds of taxes, but from a social perspective, anything that ultimately falls on the general poor class cannot be called a good tax. Why? It is extremely unreasonable to ask the unequal wealthy and poor to bear the same burden. This is not a matter of the merits of the theory, nor a matter of differences in beliefs, but a matter of actual gains and losses. If the Municipal Council can pay attention to this, then it should increase the tax on those with a greater ability to bear the burden, which is the right thing to do. For example, various businesses related to entertainment, games, and enjoyment are all greatly blessed by the god of war. Also, various businesses with a speculative nature are unusually active due to the environment, and are all smoothly operated. These businesses are all operated, consumed, and enjoyed by those with wealth. If these are the targets for increasing regular surtaxes, and the source of new revenue, then even if it is increased to 100%, 200%, or even 300% or 400%, it would not be excessive, because it is purely a luxury tax. Although there are no statistics to calculate this revenue, if the Municipal Council is determined to rectify it, the amount will definitely be considerable, and it would be sufficient to supplement the finances. Even if it is not enough to fill the deficit, it can still make the burden lighter for those who bear other burdens.

After the luxury tax is drastically increased, if it is still necessary to increase the house tax, then it should not be collected with a single tax rate. It is necessary to carefully formulate various standards, differentiate between levels, and vary the tax rates accordingly. Attention should be paid to the lowest rental value. Those who do not reach this level should still be taxed at the old rate, without increasing the surtax. This method may be more cumbersome in terms of procedure, but it can be solved by increasing the number of Chinese assistants who do not need to be paid in foreign currency. The spirit of this is to differentiate the burden between the rich and the poor, and to differentiate the obligations of those who enjoy and those who use. If the Municipal Council can think for the majority who are struggling to make a living, then it should give serious consideration to the method of levying house tax in grades.

There is one more thing I would like to tell the Municipal Council. After the rumor of increasing the surtax spread, the talk of reducing expenses arose accordingly, focusing on items such as the band. I believe that there is no end to the debate on the branches and leaves of finance. However, the so-called public economy, which follows the economic principle of "spending according to income" should not be quoted in this abnormally transformed society. Everything that can increase the living standards of the citizens, and everything that can be avoided should be avoided. Although Shanghai is prosperous, it cannot be compared with London or New York. Therefore, when dealing with the public economy, one should use the perspective of Shanghai, save what can be saved, economize what should be economized, and spend according to income. This is also a way to balance the budget.

In other words, they obtain special rights and interests based on special agreements, in order to monopolize the special professions of Central China. In addition, there are ordinary commercial companies organized as (ordinary legal persons) to seize various economic benefits. This mechanism is centered on the (Central China Development Company). The company invests in the organization of various companies to form an extortion network, which functions much like the (South Manchuria Railway Company). Therefore, the Japanese also signed the so-called (Directing and Supervising the Sino-Japanese Joint Ventures Invested by the Central China Development Co., Ltd.) with the puppet organization to determine the scope of the Japanese local authorities and the puppet organization's exercise of guidance and supervision. The original text is as follows: Directing and Supervising the Sino-Japanese Joint Ventures Invested by the Central China Development Co., Ltd. 1. Guiding Principle: The Japanese local authorities and the Reformed Government authorities shall cooperate with each other to promote the revival of the Central China economy and implement the gist of Sino-Japanese cooperation.

### Yangtze and Pearl Rivers Still Not Open, Infringing on Third-Party Trade, British Government Urges Japan to Take Note

London: Conservative Party member Morgan asked in the House of Commons last night whether the Yangtze and Pearl Rivers have been opened for general trade as promised by the Prime Minister on December 18. If not, to what extent are commercial and shipping activities in these two areas currently restricted? Foreign Under-Secretary Butler replied in writing that neither the Yangtze nor the Pearl River has been opened. Current arrangements for the Pearl River allow one British ship to go to Guangzhou once a week. As for the Yangtze River, navigation above Jiangyin remains closed to third-country shipping. Even below Jiangyin, British ships face some difficulties. He said that these difficulties have been brought to the attention of the Japanese authorities. Morgan also asked what steps the British government has taken regarding the resumption of British inland navigation within the Yangtze River Delta, apart from the Yangtze River itself, and whether British ships can now freely travel along their original routes. Butler stated in his written reply that Foreign Secretary Halifax is currently instructing local British authorities to prepare a report on the current situation in the inland waterways. (Reuter dispatch dated one day)

London: Conservative Member of Parliament Sandeman stated in the House of Commons that the Japanese are still stingy in allowing British ships access to Qingdao docks, and that the only dock nominally available to foreign ships is either occupied by the Japanese or unusable. He asked if the Prime Minister was aware that the Japanese intend to obstruct British trade for another year, and whether the Japanese government would genuinely try to end the serious incidents harming British trade and dignity. Under-Secretary Butler replied in writing that until March 25, 1939, third-country ships had to anchor outside Qingdao port to load and unload cargo. Since that date, one jetty and two berthing areas have been opened, but without warehousing facilities, and these docks and berths are very unsafe in bad weather. In addition to these difficulties, all berths were occupied by Japanese ships for three months last year. Only after the end of October could British ships resume using the docks, and the third berth has also been available since January 13. From the perspective of British shipping, there are still many dissatisfactions, but it feels that there have been some improvements recently. The British government will continue to push for improvements whenever the opportunity arises. (Reuter dispatch dated one day)

### Strict Japanese Inspection of News Telegrams Discussed in the House of Representatives

Tokyo: News telegrams sent from Japan are about to be subjected to stricter inspection, as the matter has recently been discussed in the Japanese House of Representatives. According to a certain member, the current method of controlling telegrams has many shortcomings. This is because the four ministries of Home Affairs, Communications, Foreign Affairs, and the Army each control newspapers. Now, the inspection matters should be uniformly handled by the Ministry of Home Affairs. Home Minister Kodama replied that telegrams sent overseas are now inspected by the Ministry of Communications. The Ministry of Communications is cooperating with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the best of its ability. To ensure the speed and integrity of the inspection procedures, it is indeed necessary to entrust this matter to one ministry for exclusive handling. He will carefully study this matter together with the relevant ministries. For the time being, he believes that close cooperation between the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Home Affairs has already resulted in sufficient control over news telegrams sent overseas. Previously, Japanese inspection of news telegrams was relatively lenient. What was deleted was mostly military and alarming news, as well as predictions about domestic political situation. Foreign reporters who sent the telegrams were not notified after deletion. (Reuter dispatch dated one day)

### Japanese Prices Continue to Rise

Tokyo: Optimism filled the Japanese stock market yesterday, with prices rising, as it was heard that the Central Price Control Committee had decided to raise the official market price limits for seventeen kinds of goods by ten to thirty percent. People in the stock market believe this means that general prices will continue to increase, even if the government's policy is to suppress prices, it will be ineffective.

### Admiral Yarnell Hates Evil Like an Enemy, Strongly Advocates for an Embargo Against Japan, Aggressor Nations Disregard Treaties and Human Dignity, America Should Actively Aid China from a Position of Justice

Washington: Retired former commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, Admiral Yarnell, wrote a letter today to Representative Shulenbai, the initiator of the bill on embargoing Japan, stating, "In social life, purely adopting a policy of 'appeasement' towards those who violate the law is absolutely ineffective. This is shown by the facts. At the same time, recent experience tells us that reasoning, principles, and laws are also ineffective with countries that deliberately invade peaceful nations, disregard the suffering of the people, and disregard humane treaties. In the past two and a half years, the blatant destruction and contempt of the U.S. rights and interests in China by Japan is countless. This shows that Japan firmly believes that trampling on U.S. rights and interests will not lead to a U.S.-Japan war, otherwise Japan would certainly not dare to do so. Furthermore, the friendship between the United States and China is a great asset of the United States, and it must not be abandoned. Therefore, our current problem is to decide whether we can allow a country that idealizes militarism to dominate this vast region. In short, if Japan's current adventure is successful, then its military warlords will certainly be able to prolong their control of the regime. Therefore, Japan's continued aggression is inevitable. For our own benefit, we should quickly decide to take active steps to help countries whose political ideals are the same as ours, because if the democratic countries of Europe and China in Asia fail in this war, our future will also be in danger."

### New U.S. Loan to China, Negotiations Mature, US$20 Million, Tin Ore as Guarantee

Washington: Jesse Jones, chairman of the U.S. Reconstruction Finance Corporation, told reporters yesterday that after Congress passes the bill to increase the capital of the U.S. Export-Import Bank by $100 million, Finland will "first" obtain a loan from the bank. China is seeking to borrow another $20 million in credit from the bank. China is willing to export tin ore to the U.S. to repay the new loan. "If China can guarantee that we can obtain tin ore, then we will lend China the loan." China has already exceeded the amount listed on the repayment schedule for the last loan. (Associated Press dispatch dated one day)

Washington: The proposal to increase the capital of the Export-Import Bank by $100 million to continue lending to China and Finland has been sent to the White House for signature today. The Senate, which passed the bill a few days ago, approved the House's amendment, allowing the loan to be used to purchase commercial aircraft, but prohibiting loans to countries that use the loans to repay war debts.

### Japan's Southern Advance Policy Causes Great Unease in Britain and France, Reflecting the Intensification of Imperialist Contradictions, Osaka Mainichi Shimbun Reporter Says, French Premier Expresses Compromise to Japan

Moscow: Recently, "The Japan Times" published a commentary on Franco-Japanese relations, stating, "Negotiations on the Japanese bombing of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway have completely failed." Pravda commented on this matter, "Japan is taking various steps (military and diplomatic) to cut off the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, thereby preventing all goods from being transported to China via Indochina. Although this action by Japan has aroused opposition from Britain, the United States, and France, Britain, the United States, and France are extremely uneasy about Japan's activities in South China, as Japan is now approaching their most important colonies in Southeast Asia. The importance of Indochina to France's economic life is well known. Even in terms of the European War, Indochina can supply raw materials and various goods to the country. In particular, all of France's needs for rubber are taken from Indochina. Therefore, the French side expresses extreme unease about Japan's offensive in South China. This sense of unease has spread to the United States, as the United States is deeply afraid of Japan's power expanding to the South China Sea. In short, this conflict between Japan and France fully proves that the contradictions of imperialism in the Pacific are becoming increasingly acute." (TASS dispatch dated one day)

Paris: French Prime Minister Daladier, in an exclusive interview with a reporter from the "Osaka Mainichi Shimbun" yesterday, said, "The German army will launch a full-scale offensive with all its strength in the spring, and the Japanese side will also begin negotiations with France on the recognition of Manchukuo." Daladier said, "Bolshevism and National Socialism are equivalent to cholera epidemics. The situation in Europe is bad. France must participate in war once every twenty-five years. Currently, France has decided to eliminate this bad situation." France is now expecting the German army to launch a major offensive in the spring. As for whether the Allied forces will counterattack if the German army does not attack at that time, it has not yet been decided, but it is quite possible. Daladier also said, "He hopes to start negotiations on the recognition of 'Manchukuo' simultaneously in Tokyo and Paris in the near future. The Chinese side agrees that the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway should not be used as a tool to transport military supplies to China, but it is not prepared to recognize the broad meaning of the Japanese side's 'contraband'." (Associated Press dispatch dated one day)

Paris: According to a reporter from the Osaka "Mainichi Shimbun," French Prime Minister Daladier said today that France's attention to the Chinese incident is not as great as its attention to European issues. The French Prime Minister's attitude towards Japan is quite conciliatory, and he said that Soviet-Japanese coordination is not beneficial to Japan. France has not actually aided China. Finally, Daladier stated that the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway is the only route for China to maintain contact with the outside world, but the United States, not France, uses this route extensively for commercial purposes, because trade between France and China is fundamentally negligible.

### Rampant Japanese Military, Deteriorating Political Situation, Elders' Attitude is Passive

Matsudaira Tsuyoshi May Resign

Tokyo: "Miyako Shimbun" stated that Internal Affairs Minister Yuasa has indicated his intention to resign at an appropriate time because the cabinet has changed four times since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, causing difficulties for his political position. The newspaper also stated that there is now a trend towards completing the wartime political system, and there is much criticism of politicians close to the Emperor. Minister of the Imperial Household Matsudaira has also expressed his willingness to resign at a suitable time for personal reasons. (Reuter dispatch dated one day)

### Saito Takao Reveals Intention to Resign, Disciplinary Committee Suspends Vote

Tokyo: According to Japanese sources, Saito Takao, an old member of the Democratic Party, questioned the Konoe Declaration in the Diet on February 2, which was originally likely to cause a political crisis. Now, because Saito expressed his intention to resign from his position as a Diet member, the political crisis has been avoided. Saito sent a letter to the chairman of the House of Representatives Disciplinary Committee, stating that he intends to resign and requesting the committee to suspend the vote on his case pending his formal announcement of the decision. Therefore, the Disciplinary Committee resolved to suspend the vote originally scheduled for March 2. (Reuter dispatch dated one day)

As for the former Chairman of the Education Committee, Turkin, he has voluntarily requested to resign from his post. (TASS dispatch dated one day)

### Turkish Prime Minister Declares Maintenance of Normal Relations with the Soviet Union, Turkish Policy Cannot Be Controlled by External Forces, Mobilization Will Not Be Spoken of Lightly Unless Survival Is Threatened

Ankara: Turkish Prime Minister Saydam broadcast last night, saying that after actively preparing for the past twelve months, Turkey is now ready for everything. Turkey has spent £30 million on the army in the past year. The recent implementation of Turkey's emergency decrees has been misunderstood by people at home and abroad. In fact, rumors that Turkey has declared a state of emergency and ordered mobilization, and that it is preparing offensive and defensive steps against the Soviet Union are all unfounded. Whether Turkey joins the war will be entirely determined by the concept of national interest. The reason why Turkey has adopted emergency decrees is only to prepare in case foreign changes make it impossible for Turkey to rely solely on its ordinary national laws. War and mobilization are major responsibilities that Turkish politicians must bear. They cannot be carried out lightly. They must be given the closest consideration. This action can only be taken when the country and its survival are threatened. Turkey's relations with the Soviet Union have not changed in the past six months. We do not want to take anti-Soviet actions, nor do we see any reason for the Soviet Union to attack us. Our purpose is very clear. The issue of our participation in the war and our diplomacy will never be controlled by external forces. The disturbances outside our borders cannot prevent us from making appropriate judgments with a calm mind. The storm that is now spreading to most of the world is already at our doorstep. He knows that all the people of the country will be able to fulfill their responsibilities. (Reuter dispatch dated one day)

Istanbul: Turkish Prime Minister Saydam stated in a speech last night that Turkey is seeking to adopt an aggressive attitude towards the Soviet Union, and at the same time, the Soviet Union does not currently have any signs of attacking Turkey. Saydam continued that since Turkey implemented the law to protect the national economy, rumors have arisen and are alarming. In fact, this move does not indicate Turkey's mobilization, nor does it indicate that Turkey is about to participate in the war, because the constitution clearly stipulates that Turkey must obtain the public approval of Congress before participating in the war. Relations between the Soviet Union and Turkey have not changed in the past six months. (Haitong dispatch dated one day)

### Gloom Envelops the Near East, Turkey Carries Significant Weight

Geneva: Reports from Swiss newspaper correspondents stationed in the Balkans all stated that the capitals of the Balkan countries are rife with rumors that the Allied powers will soon plunge the Near East into war. The reports claimed, "The Balkan Peninsula is now considered to be on the verge of the outbreak of war on the Caucasian front, or even conflict on the borders of the Soviet Union with Iran and Afghanistan. General Weygand, commander-in-chief of the Anglo-French Allied forces in the Near East, has apparently planned to attack the Baku oil region, with the aim of destroying the Soviet Union's wartime infrastructure and preventing the transport of Soviet oil to Germany. If this is the case, the European war will enter its second phase. According to Swiss correspondents, telephone communications between Turkey and Yugoslavia have been severed. Although the true extent of the threat of war to Asia Minor is unknown, the mobilization measures of Turkey and the countries of Iran, Iraq, and Afghanistan all indicate that the situation in the Near East has reached a critical juncture." (Haitong dispatch dated one day)

Rome: Romanian political commentator Cica Mu wrote an article in "Curentul" today, discussing the possibility of "amazing events" in the Near East, stating that because of the proximity of the Caucasian oil fields to the Near East and the increasing cooperation between Germany and the Soviet Union, the Allied powers will launch an offensive in the region. If this is the case, Turkey's attitude will carry significant weight. If Turkey maintains its neutrality, the Black Sea will be outside the war zone, and then the shipping of all countries neighboring the Black Sea will be completely reorganized. (Haitong dispatch dated one day)

### Rumor That Britain Asks Turkey to Allow Ships to Open the Black Sea, Under the Pretext of Protecting Shipping, London Denies

Rome: Observers here are closely watching the Near East issue. They forcefully stated that the sudden increase in rumors about Turkey in recent days is clearly spread by the Allied powers. They are paying unusual attention to rumors such as Soviet troops in the Caucasus fleeing into Turkey, Soviet submarines being found in the Bosphorus Strait, and Turkey recalling overseas merchant ships. The Paris "Times" reported that the Turkish army is poorly equipped and lacks mechanized units. People in Turkish military circles claimed that it is absurd for the Allied powers to hope that Turkey will launch an offensive in the Caucasus while reiterating the weakness of the Turkish army. Turkish shipping companies have denied recalling merchant ships. Political figures here are very satisfied because this news will affect Italian-Turkish trade. (Haitong dispatch dated one day)

Rome: People close to official sources here said that the British government is rumored to have requested Turkey, based on the 1936 Montreux Convention, to allow its warships to pass through the Dardanelles and Bosphorus Straits to the Black Sea to protect shipping. Although this has not yet been confirmed, if it is true, the Italian government should also make a similar request, because the Italian government signed the Mediterranean Agreement with Britain on April 16, 1938, and signed the Montreux Convention on May 2 of the same year. Although Turkey has special ties with Britain and France through a mutual assistance pact, the various clauses contained in the Montreux Convention are still fully effective. Italy is in the same position as other signatory countries and should not be discriminated against. Moreover, it is difficult to predict how the current European war will develop. In order to prepare for the future, Italy must pay attention to the safety of its overseas shipping lines. In short, no matter what happens in the Balkans and the Near East, Italy cannot turn a blind eye. (Havas dispatch dated the 29th)

London: It has been rumored from the Italian side that the British government has already requested Turkey, based on the 1936 Montreux Convention, to allow British warships to pass through the Dardanelles Strait into the Black Sea to protect shipping. This statement has been denied by those in charge. (Havas dispatch dated one day)

### Britain Plans to Fund India to Modernize the Army

London: Under-Secretary of State for India Amery stated in the House of Commons last night that the British government has agreed to propose to Congress that it should fund India £34 million to be used to modernize the Indian defense forces over five years. A quarter of the software will be a loan to India. This recommendation was made by a committee chaired by Minister of Defense Coordination Chatfield after investigating the situation of the Indian Army last year. (Reuter dispatch dated one day)

German Deputy Foreign Minister Weizsäcker and Director of Protocol Dörnberg both went to the station to welcome him. Welles' visit is of an informal nature, so only representatives of the German government, members of the U.S. Embassy, and a few journalists welcomed him at the station. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop is scheduled to receive Welles at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs this afternoon (7:00 p.m. Shanghai time). (Haitong dispatch dated the 2nd)

Berlin: The official gazette published here today stated that Foreign Minister Ribbentrop received U.S. Under Secretary of State Welles at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today. Counselor of the U.S. Embassy and Chargé d'Affaires Kirk was also present at the meeting. (Tungtung dispatch dated one day)

Berlin: U.S. Under Secretary of State Welles arrived here this morning and is scheduled to meet with Leader Hitler and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop this afternoon. In addition, Dr. Weizsäcker of the German Foreign Ministry, the entire staff of the U.S. Embassy, and international journalists all went to the station to welcome him. After arriving in Berlin, the U.S. Under Secretary's party took a car to the Hotel Adlon to rest, as it is located near the U.S. Embassy in Germany. According to sources in the German Foreign Ministry, Hitler intends to explain the reasons why the war is unavoidable and ask for the U.S.'s understanding. He will also state that Germany's current war is being fought for justice, so that Germany can obtain an equal position in Europe. As for the peace offensive, Germany is unlikely to launch it for the time being, for fear that this action will be seen as a weakness. (Associated Press dispatch dated one day)

Berlin: U.S. Under Secretary of State Welles arrived at Berlin Station this morning and made a speech, which was quite humorous, stating that the difference between Britain and Germany is that Britain has whiskey and soda, while Germany has the two major arms factories of Pilsner and Skoda. Welles then left the station and stayed at the Hotel Adlon. At noon, he went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to visit Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, and the conversation lasted for an hour. It is said that Welles will meet with Berlin-based reporters from various U.S. newspapers at 2:30 this afternoon. (Haitong dispatch dated one day)

### Lord Tavistock's Peace Plan Receives German Support, British Political Circles Do Not Pay Attention

London: Lord Tavistock and the British Christian Reconstruction Organization in Europe have published a so-called peace plan. Most British newspapers are not interested in it. Newspapers such as "The Times" have completely ignored it. According to a Reuter diplomatic correspondent, political circles do not pay attention to this plan, believing that it is just another expression of the peace offensive launched by the German propaganda machine, and that it is obviously contrary to Hitler's recent speech. It is rumored that the plan is currently supported by the German side, which stipulates (1) the reconstruction of the Slovak state, but on the condition of maintaining neutrality, (2) the restoration of an independent Polish state, giving it access to the sea and railway transportation facilities, and the right to use the Vistula River, (3) Germany can hold a referendum in Austria, but will not accept international intervention, (4) If other powers are willing to reduce armaments, Germany is also prepared to do so, (5) Germany is prepared to rejoin the League of Nations, but must obtain a guarantee of fair action, (6) Germany is prepared to consider suggestions that it can obtain raw materials from colonies, and if these raw materials are not paid for with gold, then Germany may not insist on reclaiming the colonies. Lord Tavistock, the initiator of the aforementioned plan, has been quite active in participating in communism, peace, and national socialism in recent years. One of his old comrades is "Lord Haw Haw," who is now believed to be in Germany working as an English broadcaster. Another person, Coning, is a member of the aforementioned committee and recently still belonged to the British Fascist Party. British officials pointed out that Britain's peace goals have long been fully clarified in the recent speeches of Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax.

### British Blockade of Germany Extends to the Far East, Japan Closely Watches

Tokyo: "Nichinichi Shimbun" stated today that the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs is closely watching the possibility that Britain and France will implement their blockade measures against Germany in the Vladivostok area. If this happens, the Japanese government may protest to Britain. This protest will be issued in the form of a warning to prevent the European war from affecting the Far East, because Japan strictly adheres to the principle of not interfering in the European conflict. "Asahi Shimbun" expressed doubts about whether the Allied forces in the Far East fleet have expanded their activities to the extent of a blockade, and said that Japan must continue to strictly adhere to neutrality on the one hand and take various steps to protect the complete rights of neutral countries on the other. (Reuter dispatch dated one day)

Ottawa: Canadian Federal Cabinet Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Mackenzie King recently stated that he has heard that the British government is negotiating with the United States to set up a port for inspecting contraband on the Pacific coast, so that goods from various countries passing through the United States to the Soviet port of Vladivostok can be inspected there. The Canadian government is unaware of this matter. (Havas dispatch dated one day)

### Frequent German Troop Movements Near the Dutch Border; Extension of the Siegfried Line Along the Belgian-Dutch Border; Germany Denies Fortifying the Danish Border

Maastricht: Yesterday, German forces continued their efforts to extend the Siegfried Line along the German border and the Limburg province of the Netherlands. According to reliable sources, Germany is extending the Siegfried Line along the Belgian-Dutch border. Although there is no blockade visible on the Limburg border, the movement of people living on the Dutch and German borders has long been restricted. People can only obtain permits from the Aelasha Bo Police Station, and these permits are only valid for twelve hours. German border officials have warned Germans traveling to the Netherlands to return to Germany before March 15. (United Press, 1st)

Informed sources in The Hague recently stated that German troops have been moving frequently along the Dutch border in the past 48 hours. Residents of various places along the German border, especially those near the provinces of Reichert and Limburg in the Netherlands, have been evacuated. (Havas, 29th)

The Hague: It is rumored that the borders between Germany and Belgium and the Netherlands will be closed starting tomorrow. Officials here recently stated that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not received any information sufficient to confirm this. (Havas, 29th)

Berlin: A spokesman for the German High Command stated yesterday in response to questions from foreign reporters that rumors about Germany constructing defenses near the Danish border are completely unfounded. The strength of Germany and Denmark is vastly different, and a non-aggression treaty was signed last year. Therefore, there is no need to mention border defenses. These rumors are likely due to labor service personnel in uniform building roads near the Danish border, leading to misunderstandings. It is also possible that rumors regarding the Netherlands were caused by the dredging of swamps. (Haitong, 1st)

### French Finance Minister Reports on Economic Situation: Reduce Consumption, Increase Production; Seek Ways to Eliminate the Crisis

Paris: Finance Minister Reynaud delivered a radio address tonight, stating, "Up to now, Germany has imposed an economic war on us. Their offensive at sea is entirely aimed at cutting off supplies to Britain and France. It has been six months since the outbreak of the war. Our financial situation is very sound, but the crisis lies only in the economic aspect, especially the rise in prices and the increase in the cost of living. Everything is dominated by the following two facts: first, production has decreased compared to before the war, and second, consumption is equal to that before the war. This situation cannot be allowed to continue. The current solution is to consume material and financial resources, and to purchase goods from abroad with part of our gold reserves. Therefore, the amount of domestic gold reserves is decreasing day by day. However, since November of last year, prices have already begun to rise. If we try to cope by raising wages, the impact will only cause prices to continue to rise. This cycle will never end. France suffered enough from this after the last European war. How can we repeat the same mistake now? In view of this, the government has signed an order approving the agreement concluded between the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of France, and will use two funds to cope with domestic and foreign payments: (1) Regarding foreign payments, the government will use part of the war fund, but its use must be kept secret so that the enemy does not know. (2) Regarding domestic payments, the government will use its deposits in the Bank of France, and the price of the franc will not change at all, so that all kinds of situations caused by the war can be handled with ease. In addition, the various laws promulgated by the government are all economic remedies, which, in short, are only to limit consumption and increase production. Our country now maintains a linked relationship with Britain, and the government has also promulgated new laws to facilitate trade between the two countries, thereby enriching this relationship. The United States believes that the monetary and economic agreements between Britain and France are sufficient to form the seeds of a future European organization. This view is extremely correct, and their sympathy should be valued by us. However, the scope of implementation of the British-French agreement must continue to be expanded." Reynaud concluded by saying that the relationship between Britain and France has great strength, but there are still many difficulties ahead in the struggle, and we must preserve our strength as much as possible to succeed.

### Soviet Forces Vigorously Attack Approaching Vyborg; Situation in the Netherlands Extremely Serious; Finnish Forces Retreat from Vyborg to Vuoksen; Fierce Fighting Still Ongoing in the Northern Petsamo Port Area

Helsinki: The General Headquarters issued a war report stating: (1) On the Karelian front, the Red Army has launched a vigorous attack on our army's positions from Vyborg to Vuoksen. Our army was forced to retreat and move to new positions. In this battle, the Red Army lost 14 tanks. The Red Army also attacked our army's positions three times in the Taipale River area, but all failed. (2) On the Ladoga Lake front, the Red Army launched an attack on Pitkäranta, but was repelled by our army. (3) In the Gum district, our army occupied many Soviet positions and has cleared out the remaining enemy forces. (4) In the northern Petsamo port area, along the Nantsijoki River, our enemy forces also came into contact, and fierce fighting is still ongoing. (Havas, 29th)

Stockholm: According to a communiqué disclosed last night, the situation in Finland is now extremely serious. Finnish forces guarding Vyborg, the coastal side of the Mannerheim Line, have been forced to retreat under terrible pressure from Soviet forces. Although the Finnish army did not easily give up an inch of land and inflicted heavy damage on the enemy, it finally retreated along the line from the Gulf of Finland to Vuoksen. Finnish forces are still standing firm around Taipale. However, according to the opinion of military experts here, if the Soviet forces break through Vyborg, the Taipale area will be seriously threatened in the rear. Soviet forces now advancing towards Vyborg have control of three railway lines and four key roads leading to the city. The expected melting snow and heavy snowstorms that usually occur in February have not materialized to hinder the advance of the Soviet forces. The Finnish army now has no choice but to resist the incessant attacks of the vastly superior Soviet forces to the death. (Reuters, 1st)

Helsinki: According to reports yesterday, the right wing of Finland's new defense line in Karelia is at Summa, 15 kilometers south of Vyborg. From there, through Aglajaärvi, Salmenkaita, towards Vuoksen, Soviet forces are attacking in three directions. The fighting on the Vyborg front is particularly fierce. Finnish forces are resisting stubbornly, using granite to stop Soviet tanks. Tank traps and air-raid shelters have been built in the forests of various positions. After breaking through the Finnish positions at Summa, the Soviet forces have launched a full-line attack on the new Finnish positions. Soviet forces at Taipale have been repelled. (Haitong, 1st)

Helsinki: People here observed today that the occupation of Vyborg by the Red Army is purely a matter of time. Soviet forces are still using fierce artillery fire to destroy obstacles on the road. Regarding a peace agreement with the Soviet Union that requires territorial concessions, both the military and civilian sectors in Finland have expressed their inability to accept it. Although the Soviet forces have achieved victories in Karelia, the morale and spirit of the Finnish people are still very strong and show no signs of decline. (Associated Press, 1st)

Moscow: According to a communiqué from the headquarters of the Leningrad Military District, the Soviet offensive in Karelia continued to develop yesterday. We occupied Vyborg, the Valkeala-Kouvola railway, and the Alappia, Hangonki, and Pirola stations (9 kilometers east of Vyborg) on that line. At the same time, we also recaptured the town of Lauritsala and the summer recreation area on the east bank of Vyborg Bay, only 2 kilometers south of Vyborg. Also, on February 28th and 29th, Soviet forces captured a total of 270 enemy fortifications, including 66 artillery batteries (excluding the 42 mentioned in the February 28th communiqué). There were no other significant developments in other areas. The Soviet Air Force bombed enemy forces and enemy military targets, and shot down 36 enemy aircraft in air battles. (TASS, 1st)

Moscow: A communiqué issued here today stated that Soviet forces have now reached a point just two kilometers south of Vyborg. (Reuters, 1st)

Finnish Government Submits Five Protests to the League of Nations

Geneva: The Finnish government today submitted the following protests to the League of Nations: (1) Soviet planes bombing civilians; (2) Soviet forces using poison gas; (3) Soviet fleet blockading the Finnish coast; (4) Soviet recognition of the "Finnish People's Government" organized by Kuusinen; (5) Soviet Air Force destroying the neutrality of the Åland Islands. (Haitong, 1st)

Helsinki: Due to clear weather yesterday, the Soviet Air Force was extremely active over Helsinki. Forty bombers flew over Helsinki and headed inland. The city issued three alerts, but no bombs were dropped. (Haitong, 1st)

Helsinki: A wireless telegram received here stated that the first team of Swedish volunteers has arrived at the front line to take over defense duties, replacing some exhausted Finnish troops. Volunteers from other Scandinavian countries will also successively arrive at the front line to take over defense duties. (Reuters, 1st)

If Mediation Succeeds, Denmark, Norway, and Sweden Will Mediate

London: Reuters diplomatic correspondents have learned from responsible neutral sources that there is a feeling that the Finnish war has now entered a dangerous phase and that several countries must reconsider their position to avoid future regrets. The only glimmer of hope is that Soviet forces have now reached the gates of Vyborg. The Soviet Union has already obtained most of the territorial concessions from Finland that it had previously demanded, except for Hanko. The Soviet Union should now be able to grant Finland a peace that preserves its independence. Since the outbreak of the Finnish-Soviet war, Britain and France have never come forward to mediate. However, if there is a slight hope of successful mediation, the governments of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden are definitely prepared to come forward to mediate. When Soviet forces began to invade Finland, President Roosevelt made an effort to achieve a peaceful solution. It is now heard that the US President is sending Under Secretary of State Welles to Europe to test the chances of peace. What is being discussed is not only the war between Germany and the Allied Powers. On Tuesday, February 22nd, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and others met with the US Ambassador and staff in Moscow for three and a half hours. At that time, the United States had the opportunity to express its wishes. However, the US President may have to wait until Welles returns to Washington before indicating whether there is an atmosphere of overall peace restoration in Europe. (Reuters, 1st)

Helsinki: The "Uusi Suomi" newspaper here carried a report from Moscow that US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Steinhardt recently held talks with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov for three and a half hours. According to responsible sources, the discussion was solely about the Finnish-Soviet war. It is heard that the US Ambassador has tried to find terms acceptable to Finland (that do not harm the country's independence) in order to end the war between the two countries. In addition, German Ambassador to the Soviet Union Schulenburg is also very active in Moscow. (Havas, 1st)

### British Planes Fly Over Germany for Reconnaissance Yesterday Morning; German Planes Also Discovered Over Britain

London: The Air Ministry issued a communiqué today stating that British planes continuously conducted patrol and reconnaissance flights over Germany at night, with satisfactory results. British flights included patrolling the Frisian Islands, aimed at curbing the activities of German mine-laying aircraft, and conducting reconnaissance patrols over the ports of Kiel and Lübeck along the Baltic Sea. They also flew over northwestern Germany for reconnaissance, including major cities such as Hamburg, Bremen, and Hanover, as well as the ports of Cuxhaven and Wilhelmshaven. Other British planes penetrated deep into central Germany and reached Berlin. (Reuters, 1st)

London: British planes flew into Germany for reconnaissance this morning, representing the most extensive operation since the outbreak of the war. After flying for six to ten hours, all planes safely returned to their bases. The pilot of one plane spotted a railway line and a nearby canal through the clouds, realizing that this was an important railway junction 17 miles south of Berlin. He dropped three flares from the sky to confirm its position and continued towards Berlin. When he flew over Berlin, searchlights on the ground illuminated the area, but no enemy fighters were seen rising, and German artillery did not fire. (Reuters, 1st)

London: A plane, believed to be a German plane, appeared over the Thames this morning, flying very high. Anti-aircraft batteries on the Essex side of the river mouth opened fire, with an intensity not seen in the area since the outbreak of the war. The plane seemed to have been driven away. A few moments later, fighter planes soared into the sky, but no alert was issued. (Reuters, 1st)

Paris: Headquarters issued a war report stating, "Yesterday, patrols from both sides were active in the Lauter River area. The air forces of both sides were also active on the front line on the 29th." (Havas, 1st)

The Hague: A correspondent for the "De Telegraaf" in Berlin cabled that Chancellor Hitler has always taken major actions in March each year, such as the abolition of the military clauses of the Treaty of Versailles in 1935, the abolition of the Locarno Pact and the entry of troops into the Rhineland in 1936, the annexation of Austria in 1938, and the occupation of Prague, the capital of Czechoslovakia, in 1939. Therefore, people in Berlin generally ask what major event will happen in March this year. (Havas, 1st)

### Rumors of Another Battle Between British and German Forces in South American Waters; Uruguay Says It's a Rumor

Montevideo: Reliable sources here called the claim that British and German forces will soon re-engage in battle in South American waters unfounded. It is said that the claim originated after the British cruiser HMS Hawkins arrived in Montevideo to refuel. (Reuters, 1st)

### Norwegian Foreign Minister Koht Declares Decision to Maintain Trade with Britain; Will Protest Again to Germany Regarding Sinking of Norwegian Ships; Anglo-Norwegian Diplomatic Issues Have Lost Their Sharpness

Oslo: Norwegian Foreign Minister Koht declared last night that Norway will re-engage with Berlin in the coming days regarding the sinking of Norwegian ships. The Nordic countries will support any protest raised as a result of this incident, and hope that other neutral countries will also support it. The warning issued by German semi-official sources that ships must not enter British territorial waters has nothing to do with international law. Norway must maintain its trade with Britain. Norwegian-British trade has always been large, and this has been the case since ancient times. During the war, Norway has lost 50 ships totaling 110,000 tons and 350 lives. It has now been proven that nine of them were sunk by the German side, and most of the rest sank after hitting mines. We do not want any contraband controls, and have already stated that controlling ships traveling to and from neutral ports violates international law, but Germany does not therefore have the right to sink Norwegian ships that are forced into controlled ports. (Reuters, 1st)

London: The Norwegian ship Brocklebank (1,583 tons) was attacked by a German plane today and was escorted to a port on the east coast of Britain by a lifeboat. (Reuters, 1st)

London: Reuters diplomatic correspondents have learned from reliable sources in London that the diplomatic issues between Britain and Norway regarding the Altmark incident can now be considered to have lost their previous sharpness. Britain is currently considering its reply to Norway's recent note. The only point in dispute is the interpretation of the clause in the Hague Convention that warships of belligerent countries are allowed to pass through territorial waters. Norway believes that the Altmark was a warship and could freely pass through territorial waters, while the British authorities said that since the Altmark was carrying prisoners of war, its passage through territorial waters was an act of war and should not be allowed. For Norway's sake, it should have refused to pass through territorial waters or released the prisoners of war at the time. As for the Norwegian government's claim that it did not know that the ship was carrying prisoners of war, its words should be credible. However, the Norwegian government's suggestion to submit the matter to arbitration would create difficult-to-solve problems from the British point of view. (Reuters, 1st)

### German Planes Fly Over the North Sea to Attack British Ships; Several Sunk

Berlin: A communiqué here stated that the German Air Force repeatedly attacked British warships and the ships they were escorting, as well as armed merchant ships, this morning. As a result, several large ships were sunk by bombs, and others caught fire. (Haitong, 1st)

London: German planes continued to attack British fishing boats in the North Sea today. British fighter planes took off to intercept and repelled them. The motor fishing boat Audacious entered the port before dawn this morning. It is said that it was bombed by a German plane. This is the third time that the fishing boat has been attacked by a German plane. Although the bombs dropped by the German plane landed nearby, fortunately none hit directly. One crew member was injured by the shock.

### Japan Intensifies Promotion of Southward Advance Policy, to Establish an Agency for Implementation

Tokyo - At a meeting of the subcommittee of the House of Representatives Budget Committee yesterday, Democratic Party member Nakajima and Seiyukai Kuhara faction member Ishizaka both made proposals, stating in brief that since the next fiscal year's budget no longer includes funds for the "Manchurian" Incident, the various agencies established by the cabinet to handle "Manchurian" affairs should be merged into the Colonial Affairs Ministry. Social Mass Party member Tahara advocated merging the Asia Development Board, the "Manchuria" Affairs Bureau, and the Colonial Affairs Ministry into one, tentatively named the East Asia Ministry. Colonial Affairs Minister General Koiso immediately replied that the "Manchuria" Affairs Bureau would likely be merged into the Colonial Affairs Ministry in the near future. As this matter concerns the Kwantung Army and other departments, opinions are being exchanged, and it will take some time to reach a consensus. As for the merger of the Asia Development Board, it will be discussed after the conclusion of the "China Incident." At this point, Shih Chüeh T'ung Chih Hui (Current Situation Comrades Association) member Ishizaka asked about the government's southward advance policy. General Koiso replied that the government hopes to use Taiwan and the Pacific mandate islands as bases to develop the economy peacefully in Thailand, the Malay Peninsula, the Dutch East Indies, and the South Sea Islands. To promote this policy, the government plans to first establish a large-scale research agency and then train personnel to engage in this development work. Regarding the issue of immigration to "Manchuria," the area of uncultivated land in "Manchuria" is very large, of which 80% is in northern Manchuria, which the government attaches great importance to. Democratic Party member Sakurai then asked if it was true that the Japanese government had suggested to the Dutch government the establishment of a non-aggression pact, but was rejected by the Netherlands. Minister Koiso replied that he was unaware of this matter. (Havas dispatch, 29th)

### Public Buses Still on Strike Yesterday; All Parties Seek Solutions; Shanghai Municipal Council Mediates, Yu Qiaqing Negotiates; Labor and Management Seemingly Should Coordinate Early; Company Hired White Russians Yesterday to Resume Routes 19 and 2

After all the vehicle and machinery workers of the British-owned China General Omnibus Company went on strike the day before yesterday morning due to their demands for improved treatment not being met, the company immediately convened a board meeting. Starting yesterday morning, they hired White Russians to resume operating buses on routes 1, 9, and 2, and invited the press to report on the situation. Yesterday, the workers held a general meeting and established the Third District Public Bus Workers United Benefit Association. The Italian soldiers who were stationed in front of the factory gate have completely withdrawn. The details are recorded as follows:

Company Convenes Board Meeting

In order to quickly resolve the labor dispute, the China General Omnibus Company, in addition to inviting General Manager Xiao Tuo the day before yesterday to convene Xie Annuoqiongsi and Transportation Manager Zhang Delan to discuss countermeasures, also convened a company board meeting at 2 PM the day before yesterday in the main office of the Sassoon House. First, General Manager Xiao Tuo reported on the workers' demands and the course of the strike. The conditions proposed by the workers were discussed in detail, but the content was not announced. A written reply to the workers was scheduled for three days later. As for maintaining public transport, a resolution was made to make every effort to proceed.

Routes One and Nine Resume Operation

For the sake of maintaining transportation, the company resumed operations of routes 1 and 9 yesterday morning. Route 1 operated fifteen vehicles (double-decker), running from Zhaofeng Park via Yuyuan Road, Jing'an Temple Road, to the Bund on Nanjing Road. Route 9 operated thirteen vehicles (single-decker), running from Zhaofeng Park via Yuyuan Road, Fuxi Road, Avenue Edward VII, to the Bund on Beijing Road. All drivers and ticket sellers were White Russians and Western staff of the company. A Chinese constable (two for double-deckers) was dispatched by the police to provide protection. However, because the ticket sellers were not familiar with the fares for each stop, all passengers were charged 20 cents, regardless of distance. A sign was posted on the bus stating "Any Distance 20 Cents."

Briefing the Press on the Situation

Company General Manager Xiao Tuo hosted a briefing for the Chinese and foreign press at his residence on Connaught Road at 3 PM yesterday to report on the recent labor dispute. He stated briefly that after the company's mechanics raised demands for improved treatment at 4 PM on the 28th, the company agreed to provide each person with a rice subsidy of $8.41 per month starting from February. Starting in March, the company would also organize the sale of rice at subsidized prices. However, the mechanics were not satisfied. The mechanics on the early shift refused to leave the factory and made eight demands to the company. Because the company needed time to consider, it could not reply immediately. At that time, the mechanics on the night shift had already arrived at the factory to work. The early shift workers, in addition to preventing the night shift from working, also removed the refueling machine in the factory, causing the situation to gradually become serious. The next morning, after the vehicle department workers arrived at the factory, they also joined the mechanics in stopping work and made thirteen demands. After the police learned of this, they dispatched detectives to the factory to maintain order and invited Italian defense forces to jointly maintain order. That afternoon, the Italian soldiers, in order to protect the company's property and maintain public order, drove the workers out of the factory. The company was forced to do this, which it deeply regrets. However, the company has always treated the workers extremely well and has not experienced any accidents in the past eight years. This sudden strike by the mechanics is very puzzling.

Workers Present Thirteen Demands

The thirty conditions jointly presented by the vehicle and machinery workers are as follows: (1) Due to the difficulty of living, we demand an increase in treatment, with a 40% increase in monthly salary. (2) Each worker demands an increase in rice subsidy, in addition to the original 25 cents per person per day, add another 25 cents per person per day, totaling 50 cents per person per day. (3) We request that the company jointly organize subsidized rice sales. If this can be realized, the workers will automatically cancel the above rice subsidy per day, but the price of subsidized rice must not exceed $20 per picul. (4) We request that the year-end bonus should still follow the old rules, and 24 work holidays should also follow the old rules, with a rest every Sunday. (5) We request that the company provide all workers with preferential treatment and free rides. (6) We request that the company provide compensation for workers who are injured or killed on duty during work hours. (7) We request that temporary workers who have worked for more than six months should be changed to permanent workers. (8) Ticket sellers, doormen, and drivers should all have a subsidy of a dollar. (9) Restore the year-end salary of one month, regardless of seniority, as a reward. (10) Working hours should not exceed eight hours per day. (11) Workers should not be dismissed without cause. (12) The $15 borrowed by new workers at the end of 1939 should be subsidized and not repaid. (13) Wages should be paid as usual during the strike.

Italian Soldiers Withdraw, Authorities Mediate

A reporter from the New Voice News Agency made a special trip to inspect the front of the company's gate at 1171 Connaught Road yesterday and learned that the Italian soldiers stationed there had completely withdrawn the night before last and were replaced by detectives dispatched by the police to protect the site. Two police cars were parked on the road in front of the gate. As for the thirteen workers who were injured by the tear gas released by the Italian soldiers the day before, they are still being treated in the hospital. Most of them are not in life-threatening condition. The striking workers are strictly maintaining order and have not taken any excessive actions. There are no striking workers in front of the company gate. In addition to dispatching the Political Department to investigate, the Shanghai Municipal Council also sent Bing Yuan from the Industrial Section yesterday to find ways to mediate.

Yu Qiaqing Appointed as Mediator

Yesterday around 5 PM, Shanghai celebrity Yu Qiaqing stepped forward to mediate, using the following three conditions: (1) Increase wages by 40%; (2) Increase rice subsidies by a certain amount; (3) Coppersmiths are allowed to ride the company's public buses for free. It is heard that the company's compradore Xiao Tuo has agreed to consider it and will reply at 9 AM today.

Driver Arrested, Still Not Released

At about 3 PM yesterday, a driver of the company's No. 133 bus was suddenly arrested by Chinese police in front of the Westward Gate of the Jing'an Temple on Jing'an Temple Road. As of the time of publication, there was still no news of his release.

Striking Workers Hold General Meeting Yesterday

The striking vehicle and machinery workers held a meeting at 2:30 PM yesterday on Yuyuan Road.

They immediately established the Third District Public Bus Workers United Benefit Association and elected representatives to petition for assistance. In addition, they also elected representatives to negotiate with the company.

### Controlling Citywide Prices; Two Settlements Will Cooperate

The Shanghai Municipal Council, noting that the French Concession Municipal Council has a committee to control prices, which has a significant impact on stabilizing people's livelihoods and maintaining public order, is also following the French Concession Municipal Council by establishing a price research subcommittee. Fei Si Tuo, Hong Ke, and Mei Luo have been appointed as committee members to study prices, determine price levels, and stabilize the market. This move by the Shanghai Municipal Council has been unanimously supported by the citizens.

It is reported that the Shanghai Municipal Council Board of Directors is considering a definite price order for price control within the settlement, and then coordinating with the French Concession authorities in order to implement it. The French Concession Municipal Council, at the end of February, was convened by French Consul General Bao Daizhi, with Consul Oqi also attending the meeting. The measures will be announced soon.

As for the subcommittee established by the Shanghai Municipal Council, it is also scheduled to convene for discussions within days. The Mainland News also reported that the Shanghai Municipal Council has decided to organize a subcommittee to study methods for controlling prices in order to alleviate the people's difficulties. Although it is considered "too late," the general public still welcomes it. It is said that the authorities of the Public Settlement and the French Concession are cooperating with each other to control prices, and there is great hope that speculators who manipulate prices for profit will restrain themselves. However, Chinese people in the city are somewhat disappointed that no Chinese people have been appointed to the subcommittee.

### Agreement Signed on Police Authority North of the Suzhou Creek; New Police District Established, Headed by a Japanese; Existing Restrictions by the Japanese Side to Be Lifted as Much as Possible

Regarding the restoration of full Shanghai Municipal Council police authority in the area north of the Suzhou Creek, the Shanghai Municipal Council has long been negotiating with the Japanese authorities. This negotiation was once suspended in August of last year, but has now come to a conclusion and an agreement has been signed. The agreement stipulates that police authority in the area north of the Suzhou Creek will be returned to the Shanghai Municipal Council, and a new police district will be established in the area, headed by a Japanese person. The above agreement was formally signed by the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council Board of Directors and the Japanese Consul General. The full text of the agreement is published as follows:

The Full Text of the Agreement is Divided into Three Sections

A. (1) A new police district will be established in the area north of the Suzhou Creek, named Police District "E." The jurisdiction of Police District "E" is the portion marked "Proposal of the Head of the Police Department" in the attached map. The candidate for the head of Police District "E" will be recommended by the Japanese authorities and appointed by the Shanghai Municipal Council on a trial basis. After a trial period of six months, if the Municipal Council deems him satisfactory, he will be formally appointed as the head of Police District "E." (2) An assistant district head will be established for Police Districts "C" and "D." The candidates will be recommended by the Japanese authorities and appointed by the Shanghai Municipal Council. (3) Japanese police officers who are deemed capable of managing the affairs of the Dixwell Road and Xing Road police stations within Police District "E" may serve under the direction of experienced Western police officers for several months in order to become familiar with the work to be handled. After four to six months, they may be appointed as chief inspectors of the above two police stations. Japanese police officers who are competent and available for deployment may also be assigned to the positions of trial officers in the police stations within Police Districts "C" and "D." (4) The employment of Japanese police officers to manage the affairs of police stations other than Police District "E" will be considered in the future, depending on the situation and the number of police officers.

B. The special deputy superintendent of the Police Department should, based on his special abilities, serve as the direct advisor to the superintendent in all aspects of police affairs, and his authority is second only to the superintendent and the acting superintendent appointed during the superintendent's illness or leave of absence.

C. In order to ensure the smooth and harmonious implementation of police authority in the area north of the Suzhou Creek, representatives from the Japanese Consulate General, the Japanese Army and Navy, and the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department should hold meetings.

Japanese Restrictions to Be Lifted as Much as Possible

One point to be noted is that Gao Shi once sent a letter to the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council Board of Directors on December 10, 1938, stating that the Japanese authorities should continue to find ways to lift various existing restrictions as quickly as possible. Therefore, it is hoped that this layer can be realized as soon as possible in order to conform to the original intention of the Shanghai Municipal Council during the negotiations.

Both Parties Signed Yesterday Afternoon

At 3 PM yesterday, both parties held a signing ceremony at the Japanese Consulate General. Fan Keling, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council Board of Directors, Fei Lipu, Director-General, Bao En, Superintendent, Chimu, Deputy Superintendent, and Miura, Japanese Consul General, Tsurumi, Director of Intelligence, Lieutenant Colonel Utsunomiya, and Lieutenant Commander Kawabata attended. After reviewing the full text of the new agreement, they signed it in sequence. At this point, the area north of the Suzhou Creek, which had been guarded by the Japanese Navy since the Incident, was finally resolved and returned to the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Municipal Council police authority.

Japanese Police Chief on Six-Month Trial

The most noteworthy part of the agreement is the establishment of Police District E, which places part of the Jiading Road Dixwell Road Police Station and Hongkou Police Management Area, which were previously in the Western District, under its jurisdiction, and places a Japanese chief in charge. However, within six months of the implementation of the handover of police authority, it is a training period for the district chief. If the Shanghai Municipal Council deems him satisfactory after the full term, he will be formally appointed.

Japanese Consul General Issues Statement

The authorities of the Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai issued a statement after the agreement was signed yesterday, briefly stating that this result began with the outline decided by the Shanghai Municipal Council authorities in August of last year, and so on. As for the point stipulated in the agreement that the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department, the Japanese Consulate General, and representatives of the Japanese Army and Navy should hold meetings in order to ensure the smooth and harmonious implementation of police authority in the area, it is reported that they will continue to hold meetings soon.

Sales Methods

Last month's low-price sales of coal balls failed to benefit the common people widely, so the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce invited the coal industry, coal ball industry, and firewood and charcoal industry to organize a low-price coal ball sales committee to discuss the sales methods. It was decided to start today. The methods are recorded as follows: (1) Fifteen member factories of the Shanghai Machine-Made Coal Ball Industry Association will sell 20,000 loads at low prices during the 20-day low-price period, which is 1,000 loads per day (a separate list of the fifteen member factories is provided). (2) A low-price committee will be established to handle all affairs, and its members will be selected by the relevant associations. The committee will be composed of four people from the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, five people from the Coal Ball Industry Association, three people from the Coal Industry Association, and three people from the Firewood and Charcoal Industry Association. (3) The meeting dates will be determined at any time, and the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce will be designated as the convener. The location will be the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce. (4) Twenty-six locations throughout the city will be designated for the exclusive sale of low-price coal balls. The low-price committee will issue city signs to these locations, designated as "Shanghai Coal Ball Low-Price Committee Coal Ball Low-Price Location No. 〇" for identification. (5) The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce will send a letter to the police authorities of the two settlements, requesting them to maintain order at the locations during the low-price sales period. (6) Each person is limited to purchasing two jiao worth of coins. (7) Each two jiao purchases four city jin of coal balls. (8) Coal balls will be sold from 2 PM every day until they are sold out. (9) Pay first, then receive the coal balls. (10) Each factory responsible for the sales will be responsible for the quality of the low-price goods. (11) Representatives selected by each association will be present every day to supervise the sales in order to ensure reputation. (12) The current round of low-price sales is tentatively set for 20 days. If we receive sympathy from enthusiastic philanthropists and are willing to provide assistance, we can consider extending the period, and the methods will be determined later.

Sales Locations

Yesterday, the Coal Ball Association sent a letter to all coal ball factories, stating that "Regarding the case of exempting warehouse rent for the low-price sale of coal balls, our association has jointly discussed with the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and the Coal Ball and Firewood and Charcoal Associations, and the results are as follows: (1) The low-price sale period is approved from the 2nd to the 21st of this month. (2) Warehouse receipts issued from March 2nd to March 15th for goods leaving the factory will be exempt from warehouse rent. (3) Warehouse rent that has already been paid will not be refunded." The above resolutions are approved. Correspondingly, we are sending this letter to inform you, and we have attached a copy of the low-price coal ball sales methods and a list of sales locations. We hope that your factory will examine and receive it, and send the quantity you previously acknowledged directly to the locations listed in the low-price sales location list before 2 PM every day starting from the 2nd of this month. We are very grateful. The list of low-price sales locations stipulated by the Coal Ball Association is as follows:

### German Goods Detained in Vietnam; Supplementary Visa Can Be Applied For; Release Possible Once Procedures Are Completed

Regarding the French Consulate's visa for German goods shipped to Vietnam before the outbreak of the European war, there are still many cases where the deadline was too short and the procedures could not be completed. According to reliable sources, the Shanghai China-France Express Transportation Company has negotiated with the Vietnam Tokyo Chinese Chamber of Commerce and obtained permission from the French authorities to apply for supplementary visas. Merchants who failed to apply for visas last time and hold valid documents such as full payment certificates before September 3rd of last year can go to the company to negotiate the procedures. After completing the visa application, the company will send it to the Vietnam Tokyo Chinese Chamber of Commerce on their behalf, which will then forward it to the General Consulate of France in Indochina, which will then forward it to the French Embassy in Paris. After the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs reviews and approves it, the German goods detained in Vietnam can be released. Therefore, the large number of German goods detained in Vietnam is not a problem.

### Unbearable Increase in Taxes and Levies; Please Negotiate with the Ratepayers' Association; Raising Levies at This Time Endangers the Market; Balancing Revenue and Expenditure Lies in Cutting Wasteful Expenses

Since the Shanghai Municipal Council announced its intention to increase municipal general tax, special house tax, and land tax surcharges by 50% starting on July 1 this year, the public has been alarmed. The district branches of the First Special District Citizens' Federation jointly sent a letter to the General Federation yesterday, stating, "We have recently learned that the Shanghai Municipal Council is planning to increase the municipal general tax, special house tax, and land tax surcharges by 50% starting on July 1 this year in order to make up for increased expenses. Upon hearing this news, the residents within the settlement are all in a state of panic. Since the outbreak of the war, the population of this city has become concentrated, and all goods have become expensive. Although industry and commerce appear to be prosperous on the surface, in reality, this prosperity is entirely consumer-driven and cannot last. Most of the citizens are from the war zones and have been here for nearly three years. Their economic capabilities are gradually being depleted. At a time when prices are soaring, their livelihoods are already under serious threat. Therefore, raising levies at this time will only deepen the market crisis. If the Shanghai Municipal Council claims that the market is improving and that most salaried employees have received salary increases or subsidies, such salary increases are merely a drop in the bucket and cannot compensate for the increased expenses due to the high prices. Therefore, we hope that the Shanghai Municipal Council will abandon the proposed increase in levies at this time when people's livelihoods are declining. The way to remedy the situation is to pay as much attention as possible to cutting wasteful expenses in order to balance revenue and expenditure. We are therefore sending this letter to request that your association and the Chinese Ratepayers' Association forward a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council, urging them to negotiate and prevent the levy increase from becoming a reality. This will benefit the citizens and the market."

### Jardine Matheson and Butterfield & Swire Shipping Companies Increase Freight Rates

According to the Mainland News, Jardine Matheson and Butterfield & Swire shipping companies have announced that freight rates for coastal ports served by their ships will increase by 5 to 10 Hong Kong dollars starting on March 1. The increase is greater for routes to South China and smaller for routes to North China. The freight rates of these two companies were already increased by 10% to 20% three weeks ago. According to the Shanghai Java Shipping Company, the fares for its ships will now be calculated in guilders, and freight rates will also be converted into foreign currencies.

### Simplified Inspection and Release Procedures for Goods Entering and Leaving the Ou River

Due to the tense situation and urgent shipment of goods, the Ou River Inspection Station has recently submitted a request to its superiors and been approved to allow the station to separately inspect and release export goods, excluding prohibited items, based on various non-Japanese certificates of origin or foreign exchange settlement forms. The goods will be submitted for record-keeping afterward. Non-prohibited or restricted items will be unconditionally inspected and released. Green oil, asphalt, and tea oil will also be decontrolled. Import goods, except for Japanese goods, will be permitted for registration and inspection and release.

### Chinese Crew Members of Sunken German Warship Arrive in Shanghai, Discussing the Terrifying Scene of the Naval Battle; Three British Cruisers Fired Shells Side by Side; Half a Stack of Shirts in the Laundry Room Was Blown Away

According to the North China Daily News, the German pocket battleship Graf Spee was scuttled off the coast of Uruguay in South America. There were six Chinese crew members on board, who were responsible for laundry work. They recently arrived in Shanghai on the Italian mail ship Conte Biancamano. They discussed the battle between the Graf Spee and the British cruisers HMS Exeter, HMS Ajax, and HMS Achilles. They said that they were hiding in the ship's laundry room at the time and did not see the battle very clearly, but they heard loud cannon fire, which was quite terrifying. Then, a shell entered the cabin and continued to fly to the opposite side. They left the laundry room and went to the infirmary to take shelter. The reason why the Graf Spee was discovered by the British ships was that the reconnaissance aircraft it was carrying could not take off to search for enemy ships. The Graf Spee had no choice but to wander around on its own. When the lookouts on the Graf Spee spotted the British cruisers, they mistakenly thought they were merchant ships. It was not until the British ships began firing eight-inch shells in succession near the Graf Spee that everyone on board was greatly shocked and tried to escape while opening eleven-inch broadsides on the British ships to defend themselves.

The two sides chased and bombarded each other for about three and a half hours before the Graf Spee finally entered the port of Montevideo in Uruguay. One of the Chinese, who had peeked at the battle, said that the largest of the three British cruisers attacked in the center, while the other two assisted on the left and right sides. None of the six men were injured, but one of them was storing shirts in the laundry room when a shell entered, hitting him in the face and blowing away half a stack of shirts, causing him great shock. It is understood that there were 425 Chinese sailors on the Conte Biancamano who had worked on German ships that were scuttled or detained in neutral ports. It is estimated that at least 2,000 Chinese sailors working on German ships have lost their jobs as a result. Most of those who arrived in Shanghai on the Italian mail ship had worked on the German ships Anatol, Gasira, Mecklenburg, and Frankfurt. These four ships have now been detained in South American ports.

### 工部局本年度預算　敎育費

Regarding the draft budget of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Education Department for this year, all the listed amounts have been discussed and reduced to the lowest possible level by the heads of the Finance and Education Departments and submitted to the Education Committee's regular meeting on February 2nd for review.

A. Temporary Expenditure Items: The important expenses under the temporary expenditure items include (1) the planned construction of a Chinese primary school for 300 students at the corner of Kiaochow Road and Singapore Road, costing 33,000 yuan. After amendment, this amount was increased to 40,000 yuan, and it was approved. (2) The proposed construction of a bicycle shed at the Western District Western Children's Public School and another bicycle shed at the Chinese Girls' Middle School, as well as lengthening the surrounding walls, with a total cost of 6,100 yuan. It was decided that the above two bicycle shed projects would be postponed until next year. (3) The internal renovation and painting of the Western District Western Children's Public School, as well as the relocation and reinstallation of a steam boiler, were approved with an engineering fee of 1,200 yuan. Also, the construction of a covered walkway at the Yu Yuen Road Western Girls' School was approved with an engineering fee of 200 yuan. (4) An expense of 100 yuan was listed in the budget for the construction of a library at the Kunning Road Chinese Primary School. (5) 1,600 yuan for miscellaneous engineering fees for Western Children's Schools and 1,500 yuan for miscellaneous engineering fees for Chinese Schools were both approved.

B. Regular Expenditure Items: According to the report of the Head of the Finance Department, the draft of the Education Department's regular expenses has been carefully reviewed and discussed with the Head of the Education Department. According to the list in the draft, 14,990 yuan has been added, so the total regular expenses are listed as 3,157,190 yuan, which is 817,270 yuan more than last year. The detailed comparison is as follows:

The reasons for the increase in the above expenses are nothing more than the high prices of various supplies and the increase in subsidies for teachers and staff. The subsidies for Western and Chinese private schools have been increased by 25% compared to last year. However, this is experimental and cannot be considered a fixed amount. There will be another report in the future.

According to the report of the Head of the Finance Department, the total amount of educational funding was previously stipulated not to exceed 2% of the total donation and land tax rate. The education budget last year was 1.84%. However, due to a sharp increase in expenditure, a total of 2,672,000 yuan was allocated, which met the 2% donation rate. However, the deficit still reached 30,150 yuan, and the deficit for this year is estimated to be 468,340 yuan. Whether this deficit should be carried over to the next year should be decided by the Board of Directors.

The total tuition fee for this year is estimated to be 643,130 yuan, of which 289,450 yuan is from Western schools and 353,680 yuan is from Chinese schools. The Head of the Finance Department, in view of the sharp increase in the cost of various schools, will propose to increase the surcharge on tuition fees for Western and Chinese schools to 50% and 30%, respectively, to make up for the deficit.

At that time, a committee member said that when the total donation rate was 14%, the education funding was stipulated to be 2% of the donation. However, now that the total donation rate has increased to 18%, the ratio of education funding has not changed. In this case, the tuition fee surcharge should be increased, or some schools should be closed. Another committee member believed that the above restriction system had many obstacles to the promotion of education, and that it was difficult to maintain the continuous increase in expenditure. Therefore, this year's education budget cannot be said to be huge, nor can it be reduced. Another committee member said that if half a percent of the total donation is allocated this year, the estimated deficit this year can be offset, and the ratio of education funding should be increased simultaneously with the total donation rate to meet the needs.

The above provisional budget has been approved by the Education Committee and submitted to the Finance Committee for review. The committee members finally decided to recommend to the Bureau that, considering the maintenance of education work during the extraordinary period, all the previous restrictions on educational funding should be lifted.

### 要求取締南市財窟　鐵門將予關閉　法當局將斷然處置

Request to ban gambling dens in Nantao, iron gates will be closed, French authorities will take decisive action

Since the opening of iron gates in various places such as Nanyang Bridge and Xieqiao, which are connected to the French Concession and Nantao, a group of profit-seeking people thought they had an opportunity and have been seeking houses in the Nantao area to open gambling dens. At present, more than a dozen small gambling dens are ready to open or have already opened. The French Concession authorities and the Nantao Refugee Area General Office believe that the opening of these gambling dens not only induces people to lose their time and jobs and go bankrupt, but also hinders public security. It is reported that the French Consul and Father Rao, the director of the General Office, Gu Lun, sent a letter to the so-called "Nantao District Government" yesterday, requesting that the opening of gambling dens be banned. It is also reported that the French authorities have stated that if the Nantao gambling dens continue to exist, the French Concession will take decisive action to maintain public security, and all the opened iron gates may be forced to close again. At that time, even if citizens hold "citizen certificates", they will be prohibited from passing.

### 昨晨曹家渡　盜匪拒捕

Yesterday morning in Zhaojiadu, bandits resisted arrest

At 2:15 a.m. yesterday morning, 5 or 6 bandits suddenly arrived at Jida Pawnshop No. 259, Wujiaochang, Zhaojiadu. Three of the bandits, holding Mauser pistols, pried open the back door of the pawnshop, broke into the upstairs of the pawnshop, and looted wildly. As a result, thousands of yuan were looted. At that time, a shop assistant, Mr. Jia, heard the alarm and immediately pressed the alarm bell, then ran to the upstairs window, shouting for help, and blowing the police whistle. The bandits heard this and knew that the incident had been exposed, but they were unwilling to give up and fired four shots at the shop assistant. Fortunately, the shop assistant was alert and was not hit by the bullets. At that time, the Jing'an Temple Police Station heard the news and immediately sent dozens of Chinese and Western detectives to encircle and suppress the bandits. The bandits knew that the situation was not good, so they quickly took steps to escape, firing several shots at the detectives. The detectives immediately drew their guns and chased after them. Later, the bandits fled into the lane of the Xiang Sheng gambling den. When the pseudo-"Bureau" heard the news, it also sent a large number of pseudo-"police" to the scene. It is reported that the police station is paying close attention to this case and is still investigating it closely.

### 日偽人員　恐嚇詐財　婦人提起自訴

Japanese and puppet personnel threatened and extorted money, a woman filed a private prosecution

A woman, He Li, who has been setting up a fish stall in the Hongkou Xiaocai Market, previously filed a private prosecution in the special court against Bao Le and Ruan Wangyu, Shang Lianqing, etc., women in the same industry, for threatening and extorting money. The complaint stated briefly that, due to the jealousy of his counterpart Le, a design to frame, at nine o'clock in the morning on October 17 last year, accompanied by Ruan Zhou and two unknown Chinese and Japanese people, falsely accused the plaintiff of owing him 1,560 yuan, and handcuffed Ms. He to a certain consulate, illegally assaulted, and demanded money. He was detained at 11 o'clock, and then the defendants escorted him to the Hongkou Xiaocai Market, forcing Wang Changkang, the owner of a small money house in the same vegetable market, to borrow 200 yuan to pay. The rest was guaranteed by Lu Ajin, who was entrusted by the plaintiff. Unexpectedly, at 11 o'clock the next morning, the defendant gathered many people to demand 360 yuan without success, and was still escorted to the consulate for detention. Fortunately, relatives and friends hired a Japanese lawyer to rescue him and reported to the Hongkou Police Station, instructing him to file a private prosecution. Therefore, he filed a lawsuit. After the special court conducted a trial, it was ordered to stop the trial due to civil litigation. Now, He Li has hired lawyer Wang Yaotang to apply for a retrial. Jiang Tuishi summoned him the morning before, but because Lu Ajin, who was wanted as a witness, did not arrive, he ordered him to wait for another date for verification.

### 司賬侵占案　主犯被逮

Accounting embezzlement case, the main culprit was arrested

連同同黨併案訊辦　偵查未終改期再訊
The accomplice was also interrogated in the same case. The investigation was not over, and the hearing was postponed.

Zai Xinbei Goods Store, 52A Yangxing Street, French Concession, has a thriving business. Shareholder Zheng Heting hired Zheng Geng as accountant. Recently, Zheng Shan geng entered the gambling dens in West Shanghai and had a huge loss. On February 2nd, he conspired with Zhang Minghong and Shen Wenkui, two apprentices in the store, to embezzle more than 17,000 yuan of accounts, and deposited 10,000 yuan of cash in the Si Hang Savings Association under the pseudonym Wang Hengjiu. He then fled to Ningbo, his hometown. When the manager found out about it, he often reported to the French Police Station, and Detective Shen Lianfang arrested the students Zhang Shen er and brought them to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court for trial. Sun Tuishi was in charge of the trial. According to the confessions of Zhang and Shen, the police also arrested two accomplices, Shen Baokang and Yu Chuangen, and tried them together. However, the main culprit, Zheng Shanzeng, was still at large. Recently, the police learned that he was hiding in Jiangbei and sent someone to lure him to Shanghai and then arrest him. Yesterday morning, he and the other defendants were brought to the same case. Fei Xizhen, the lawyer of the police station, requested the court to postpone the trial because the investigation was not over. Zheng Shanzeng confessed to the embezzlement. All the embezzled money, except for 10,000 yuan deposited in the Si Hang Savings Association, the remaining 7,000 yuan has been lost. After questioning each defendant, the court ordered that the retrial be held on the 6th of the month. Each defendant was selected and defended. The lawyer's request for bail was rejected.

### 浦東高橋　公共汽車墮河　壓傷婦孺等多名

Yesterday afternoon at 4:15, a tragic bridge collapse and injury occurred in Tiandengtou, Gaoqiao Town, Pudong. A "public bus" belonging to the so-called "Public Works Bureau" fell into the river and was damaged, injuring several women and children on the spot. The Jiangsu Maru, a Gaoqiao bus of the Japanese Shanghai Ferry Company, carried passengers from the Beijing Road Pier back to Pudong at 3 pm yesterday. Arriving in Gaoqiao at about 4 pm, more than 100 passengers landed, of whom more than 40 took a public bus to Gaoqiao Town. When driving to the No. 1 Datong Bridge on the Gaoqiao Highway, there was a sudden crash,

The bridge body was interrupted

Collapsed, the rear half of the public bus fell into the river, the two rear wheels were in the water, and the front of the car was stranded on the bridge foot. All the passengers fell completely into the rear half of the car body, pressing on each other and unable to move. At that time, a passenger kicked through the glass window, and the passengers climbed out of the rear window one by one. At that time, there were two pseudo-police chiefs, a woman, and a boy over ten years old, who were all injured and were rescued to Gaoqiao for treatment. There was also a boy over twelve years old who was more seriously injured, breathless and unconscious, and was hugged to the Jiangsu Maru by everyone.

Try to rescue

Gradually waking up, the children and others started the Jiangsu Maru and gathered 51.7 yuan in French currency, which was sent to the hospital in Shanghai for treatment. The children were cyanotic and had a severe condition. It is not yet known whether they can preserve their lives. It is said that Datong Bridge was repaired once last year, because the local "District Office" did not pay the workers' wages. When the bridge was found to be in a dangerous condition this year, workers were recruited to repair it, but no one was willing to contract the work, which led to the tragedy. A "public bus" was also severely damaged and cannot be driven.

The foreign exchange market yesterday, HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged. The black market for British and American exchanges was relatively calm, because HSBC was still willing to maintain the current four shillings and one and two five. Initially, the sharp contraction of the US-British exchange rate abroad caused the market to open with a flat British and tight American image. The price was four shillings and one and two five and six yuan seven one eight seven five. Subsequently, China Merchants Bank and other banks climbed into the shilling and a Chinese bank bought and sold April futures on behalf of Hong Kong, and the foreign trade community also climbed up slightly. However, Xin HSBC was willing to supply the current shilling as much as possible, so other foreign firms were willing to spit it back, which stabilized the market. The flag was slightly reduced due to the wind, and the goal was to sell continuously. At this time, the currency exchange also issued some US dollar bills, which led to the US exchange rate once reaching six yuan and seventy-five. Finally, because the non-sick industry came back to buy, it immediately subsided like a Sichuan dog barking at the sun. The transaction was sparse at noon, and the situation was very quiet. Until the afternoon closing, the spot prices were all flat, and the futures softened darkly. In the afternoon, both buyers and sellers hesitated, and the market was silent. There was no change. By the evening closing, it was still the same as the morning opening, resulting in a 03125 British-American tight compared to yesterday. The potential of futures this month is slightly different from the spot, resulting in a 015625 British long and a 03125 American short compared to the previous British.

Hong Kong settled in April futures

At the beginning of the morning, the London big streak, the recent long 0625, the speed period has not changed, the New York silver price is still flat, London raw gold is stable, and the exchange rate of British to American, Shanghai, French and other exchanges are flat. The US to British is reduced by two points, the Shanghai to French is down by one cent, and the French to British is down by one cent and one two five. The central listed exchanges are as before, and the bank opened the spot selling price in the morning. British gold is four shillings and one two five, and the US exchange rate is six yuan seven eight seven five. Compared with the previous closing, British is flat and American is tight three one two five, which is due to the reduction of the exchange rate by two points. After opening, a certain bank in North China did not climb into the spot shilling, but HSBC was quite willing to supply it, and the price was four shillings one two five. After a while, a certain Chinese bank was suddenly entrusted by Hong Kong to climb into April futures for both British and American gold. The price was four shillings and six yuan half, which were supplied by Youli. The supply and demand were evenly matched, and there was no change. The HSBC listing was announced without moving, and the silver balancing tax was announced at 025. After that, foreign firms also came to settle in HSBC's spot British gold at four shillings and one two five, and then Taiyeli and other foreign firms bought spot exchange at six yuan seven one eight seven five. At that time, Youli's stomach was still good, so the US exchange rate once returned to six yuan seventy-five. It is estimated that a certain bank could give the same industry a spot US exchange rate of six yuan seventy-five. At the same time, the currency exchange industry did not give foreign firms US dollar bills at six yuan eighty one two five. Then, because the foreign industry had some cotton settlement, it came back to buy, which caused the US exchange rate to return to flatness immediately. After that, buying and selling were cautious, and the state suddenly became calm. Until the afternoon closing, there was no change. British gold was still standing still at four shillings one two five, and the US exchange rate was still six yuan seven one eight seven five. The forward four-month futures were slightly tight and soft, and the price was four shillings and six yuan four six eight seven five.

### Multi-Party Affected by Tight Credit, Gold Market Wants to Rise But Stops, Fluctuation Range Also Narrows, Daily Trading Volume About 2,000 Taels

Yesterday's cash red dark market conditions, although the US dollar slightly showed weakness, gold prices did not show much color, mainly because the fundamental reason is still tight credit. This point greatly restricts the power of multi-party activities, so most long positions do not hold their positions for long, and they are very willing to close out with a small profit at any time. Moreover, the Hong Kong firms' demand is sluggish, resulting in a slight decline in the end. In terms of immediate crystal conditions, the opening in the morning was quite flat, at 4,860 yuan. Then, a certain gold shop's barge customer bought in, pulling it up by 10 yuan. Subsequently, securities firms suddenly competed to buy, and at that time the US dollar reported firm, so it was pushed down slightly to 4,845 yuan. Then, the exchange rate returned to flat, and gold shops' buying intentions suddenly increased, coupled with retail investors taking advantage of the low price to buy in, and it continued to rise to a peak of 4,870 yuan. Soon, securities firms saw an opportunity and again sold, and a certain bank and gold shop also rushed to sell again, and then gold shops sold out, resulting in a further small decline to a low price of 4,836 yuan. After that, securities firms made some profits and re-entered the market. Although a certain bank again sold, it finally recovered several yuan by the close of noon, to 4,842 yuan. The afternoon market hovered, with even smaller fluctuations, but the market trend was slightly hardened. Although a certain gold shop and a certain securities firm sold off one after another, it ultimately continued to improve by 7 yuan due to the strong suction from the money exchange industry, to 4,849 yuan. As a result, it was still down slightly by 13 yuan compared to the previous day, and the total daily transaction was about 2,000 taels. Gold jewelry shops did not change their prices, and customs gold remained unchanged.

The "red" also fell slightly by 13 yuan

Since the opening of the morning, the situation was quite flat. At first, a securities firm sold 50 taels to a certain gold shop for 4,860 yuan, a slight decrease of 2 yuan compared to the previous close. Soon, a certain gold shop still had buying appetite, and retail investors also followed up slightly, stepping up by 10 yuan. A certain gold shop entered 20 taels of money exchange business, for 4,870 yuan. Later, a certain securities firm suddenly sold on behalf of its firm, and the US dollar exchange rate was slightly reported firm at that time, and gold shops and money exchange businesses also sold each other, and in a moment it was fiercely suppressed by 25 yuan. A securities firm paid 30 taels to the money exchange business for 4,845 yuan. Then, gold shops saw the cheapness and aggressively entered, coupled with a certain bank also dragging retail investors in, and the exchange rate suddenly reported a return to flat, so the market rose again, reaching 4,870 yuan. However, after that, buyers gradually decreased and the selling momentum suddenly increased. A certain securities firm came to sell again, and a certain gold shop made a profit and sold again. In addition, gold shops and a certain bank also sold each other, and again fell by a small 34 yuan. A gold shop sold 10 taels to a gold shop for 4,836 yuan. At 11:15, money exchange businesses bought cheaply, and a certain securities firm also turned from selling to buying, and immediately recovered 18 yuan. A securities firm entered 44 taels of help from the gold shop for 4,854 yuan. At noon, a certain bank started selling again, and it was lowered by 12 yuan. A certain company paid 30 taels to the gold shop for 4,842 yuan, as the closing price for the noon. In the afternoon, the money exchange business came to search for purchases first, and the market opened 8 yuan higher. A certain gold shop entered 20 taels of gold shops for 4,850 yuan. Later, a certain bank also tracked and bought in, and continued to rise by 5 yuan, entering 20 taels of help from the gold shop for 4,855 yuan. However, after that, a certain gold shop suddenly sold fiercely, for 40 yuan. Gold shops did each other 10 taels for 4,845 yuan. Later, a certain money exchange business forcefully entered more than 100 taels, and again pulled up 18 yuan. The gold shop paid 50 taels to the securities firm for 4,863 yuan. After entering, a certain securities firm suddenly sold on behalf of the customer group, and then stepped back 14 yuan. The securities firm paid 20 taels to the gold shop for 4,849 yuan, as the closing price for the evening. As a result, it was down slightly by 13 yuan compared to the previous day, with fluctuations of 34 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of the cash gold number's own brand gold is several yuan higher than the "red", and the purchase price is reduced by 20 yuan. The current bid gold is more than 50 yuan lower than the "Yi" brand gold, and there is little trading.

Gold Jewelry Still Hangs at the Original Price

The gold jewelry in the gold shops is exchanged per tael, and it does not move all day. The Da Tong Hang still hangs at the original price of 490 yuan. The new firms have the same price as the upper price, and the purchase price is reduced by about 15 yuan.

### Bank Preparation Committee, February Remittance Deposit Interest, Set at 3.5 Yuan Per Thousand Yuan

### Large Bars Close to Long-Term Flat - Indian Silver Varies -

London, 29th - The silver market had some trading, and the market was particularly slow. After the close, it remained flat. The recent large bar silver was 0.0625, and the long-term price did not change. New York silver reported that the US spot price was still flat. Also, Bombay silver reported that the Indian silver spot price fell by 3 annas, and there was no change in April. A total of 150 transaction orders were made.

### Food - Rice Market - Any Movement Sees a Rise

Yesterday's rice market situation was similar to the previous day, and it was still a morning rise and afternoon fatigue situation. At the opening of the early market, the general local hometown shops took the opportunity of yesterday's rice price returning to flat to continue to purchase, and the situation turned tight again. The market rose step by step, and the highest price rose by more than one yuan compared to the previous market. No. 1 Saigon was sold at 47.5 yuan, Huojiao was 45.7 yuan, and all other foreign goods were good. However, after this wave, the goods in the hands of floating speculators returned to the market at a high price. Since the chips on the market surged, the stores' real appetite did not change their rash re-entry, and they all announced that they would withdraw their hands, and the overall market color suddenly suffered a setback, and it was no longer able to rise as vigorously as in the early market, and it also went down step by step. As a result, the closing quotations for various foreign rice were only 45 jiao better than before. No. 1 Saigon was 47 yuan, Huojiao was 45.2-3 yuan, Tokyo Jiantou Dashi goods returned from 42.5 yuan to 42 yuan, and mixed broken rice returned from 36.5 yuan to about 36 yuan. The number of transactions has increased from more than 3,000 to 5,000-6,000 bags. Although some profit-taking floaters sold out, the spot high prices were all raised by 45 jiao. In terms of futures, because the market was firmly held, the Tongshi only opened 200-300 tons of No. 2 Saigon Xiaojiao, No. 2 Saigon was 53 yuan, and Xiaojiao was 51.5 yuan. However, in the afternoon, there were again floating retail investors selling out, and the entrants did not move, and the market showed a soft image again.

In the morning, glutinous rice took advantage of the foreign rice boom, and there were many customer groups pulling in. The market price once rose by half a yuan, but the impact also returned to flat, without much rise. In terms of thick and thin japonica and early and late rice, etc., there were more than 2,000 bags that were transferred from Hongkou yesterday. However, it was heard that the dark market outside the market was extremely expensive, and it was not easy to invite the owner, and it was very few to want to make it. Only Changxi Special Japonica still had a slight opening. For the rest, such as thin rice and early and late rice, the goods owners were still trying to keep pace with foreign rice, which led to the other party not intending to pick it up, and there was no transaction.

Foreign rice also arrived in Shanghai. Yesterday, the French ship MIN (transliteration) directly transported more than 70 bags of foreign rice from Xihuang, imported at noon, and docked at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou to unload.

### Su Wheat Slightly Down

There is no special change in flour. The declining trend of old car brand return goods has also subsided slightly, and there are a few inquiries from rural villages in the mainland. The warehouse receipt price is 14.4 yuan, which is up 2 jiao from the previous day. Other artillery, warship and other brands do not have formal market conditions. In this time of high prices, the market of 2-3 jiao up and down is equal to no glory or disgrace. Today, 1,000 bags of flour were transported to Tianjin.

Yesterday's wheat transactions included the opening of five trucks of Suzhou wheat, priced at 24.5 yuan, which is a small decrease of 5 jiao compared to the previous opening price. According to Suzhou white wheat, the quality is the best, and it is different from the situation in Wuhu wheat. It is said that the current bottom of domestic wheat is less than 30,000 bags, and the new pricing of foreign wheat is 30 yuan, which remains to be verified.

### Oil Market - No Real Sales of Raw Soybean Oil

In the past two days, the wind and waves in the oil market have gradually calmed down. The market fluctuated slightly yesterday, but its activity was not great. In the early morning, the market was affected by foreign influences, and the soybean oil market rose, which was a 1.5 yuan increase from the previous day. Peanut oil also returned to the market. In the afternoon, the sales of materials were lacking, and people's hearts were not swimming, and the market turned from high to low. As a result, it was the same as the opening price. The Tongshi totaled the transaction of 180 barrels of Lian You, priced at 114.5 yuan, 114 yuan, 20 barrels of Jiangbei oil, priced at 112 yuan, and 150 dan of Dayou oil, priced at 91.5 yuan, 91 yuan, 100 barrels of Qingdao raw oil, priced at 115.5 yuan, 115 yuan, 2,600 cans of Jiangbei raw oil, priced at 110 yuan, and 200 cans of Yantai raw oil, priced at 109 yuan.

### Securities - Public Bonds Rebound - Foreign Stocks Go From Weak to Strong

In the securities dark market, yesterday's market turned from weak to strong, and gradually revealed vitality. The market is also rumored that there will be the issuance of treasury bills, which is only for the purpose of controlling the exchange rate, and has nothing to do with public bonds. Ambassador Johnson's trip to Chongqing may be related to the financial aspects. The credit crunch is due to the hoarding of cotton yarn, which is only a change of direction for hoarding families.

### This Road is Blocked!

— Huang Jiayin

I say that the current social system has already reached a dead end like a bull's horn. This is not a deliberate exaggeration, but a real and undeniable situation. We only need to look at the sharpening of social contradictions to understand what I mean.

A tragedy occurred in Tianjin where starving people robbed flour. The police, in order to maintain order, opened fire to suppress the riot, resulting in the death of six starving people.

Under the current situation, these starving people would have starved to death sooner or later, so killing six of them is not a big deal. However, from this painful fact, we can clearly see the sadness and bewilderment of the current society:

Flour is meant to be eaten, but now it is hoarded, causing many people to sigh when they see flour. This seems to be the fault of the flour merchants. However, the flour belongs to the merchants, and they have the right to do whatever they want with it. No one can interfere with them. Therefore, the flour shop owners seem to be blameless and feel justified.

The duty of the police is to maintain the peace and order of society, so it is justifiable for them to use guns when they see starving people robbing flour. However, the poor people with rumbling stomachs are really starving and, seeing so much flour piled up, due to their natural needs, their appetites are aroused, and they rise up to rob it. How can you kill people for no reason? Don't the poor have the right to live?

The weakness of the current social system lies in this: on the one hand, it cannot limit the excessive exploitation by wealthy merchants, and on the other hand, it fails to take care of the lives of the majority of ordinary people. That's why I say the current social system has reached a dead end like a bull's horn, because "this road is blocked"!

Military Preparations

### Mines

— Lu Degang

Since the outbreak of the European War, we have seen reports that countless ships of England, France, and many neutral countries have been sunk by German mines. There are also countless fishing boats that have been sunk by mines while fishing in the ocean. However, because fishing boats are generally small, although several are sunk every day, ordinary newspapers often neglect to report them.

What exactly are mines? Why are they so dangerous? What is their construction like? Readers would surely be interested to know.

Mines are divided into two types: fixed mines and magnetic mines. Let's first talk about the first type:

A fixed mine consists of two parts: the first part is a hollow iron ball that can float on the surface of the water. The ball contains powerful explosives, weighing between one hundred and two hundred kilograms. The ball is equipped with three metal-encased glass tubes as detonators. When any of these detonators touch the hull of a ship, the glass tube breaks, and the sulfuric acid inside flows into a battery. Immediately, an electric current is generated, causing the explosive to detonate instantly. The second part of a fixed mine is an anchor shaped like a frog, with four small wheels to facilitate movement on the mine-laying ship. The anchor has an iron cable attached to it, allowing it to connect to the floating iron ball.

The ship used to lay mines can be an ordinary ship, a warship, or a submarine. The laying method is also very simple: first, the mine's anchor is dropped, securing it to the seabed. The iron cable on the anchor keeps the iron ball at a fixed depth in the seawater, preventing the ball from floating freely. The depth of the ball below the surface of the water is determined by the situation. If the mine is intended to detonate ships on the surface, the iron ball is placed two meters below the surface. If it is used to detonate submarines, then the iron ball is placed twenty meters below the surface.

The deployment of these fixed mines is also divided into two types: the first type is called the "rosary bead" method, which means placing a row of mines in a straight line, sometimes even connecting each mine with a rope. The second type is called the "dispersed" method, which means placing several rows of mines one after another.

During the last World War, the naval authorities of Great Britain and the United States, in order to destroy German submarines, laid a long minefield from Scotland to Norway in the North Sea, burying a total of seventy-seven thousand and thirty mines.

Next, we will talk about magnetic mines. The construction principle of magnetic mines is roughly the same as that of fixed mines, but magnetic mines do not have anchors and have magnetic properties, drifting with the waves without a fixed direction. Therefore, the danger of this type of mine is greater. According to international law, it is not allowed to be used, but Germany currently disregards these regulations and uses them extensively, causing ships of neutral countries to often be attacked by mines innocently. Therefore, the naval authorities of Great Britain and France send many minesweepers to the ocean to retrieve these mines every day, day and night. This work is arduous and dangerous, but they believe that one day they will be able to remove all these terrible things!

Special Feature

### Friend of China – Ambassador Johnson

— Xia Chu

Ambassador Johnson is short and stout, resembling a pillow. At fifty-three years old, his hair, eyebrows, and eyelashes are already thin and light blonde. He has a ruddy complexion, a rather large nose, a strong jaw, and a smile that never ceases. In appearance, he looks more like an American businessman than the plenipotentiary ambassador of the United States of America.

Eleven years ago—that is, in 1929—he became the minister to China. In 1935, he was promoted to be the first American ambassador to China, with his salary increasing from $10,000 to $17,500. These years have coincided with China's turbulent times, and the United States is most concerned about the safety of the Far East. Ambassador Johnson's responsibilities have undoubtedly become even greater.

He arrived in China during the late Qing Dynasty. At the age of twenty-four, he was already working as a judge in the "New Yamen" in Shanghai, which proves how early his relationship with China began! In 1918, he was recalled to the country and served in the Far Eastern Division of the State Department. He later rose to become the director of the Far Eastern Division. At forty, he became the Under Secretary of State, and two years later, the important task of envoy to China fell on his shoulders, and he has remained there until now.

He is truly a Sinophile, able to speak good Mandarin, not only able to understand Chinese newspapers, but also able to read classical Chinese. His linguistic talent is outstanding. When he was studying at the University of Washington in the United States, he mastered Greek, Latin, and German very well. He can sing Chinese songs and also plays the pipa very well. When friends gather, nothing is more interesting than having him sing a song.

Ambassador Johnson has no airs. He has the informal and modest attitude of an American. When meeting with reporters, he often wears only a shirt. At banquets, he always likes to sit on the floor. He drinks very little alcohol and likes to smoke a cheap brand of cigarettes called Hadman. He loves to read "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" and always carries this book with him when he travels to various ports in China. He also loves to read detective novels. In addition to the Chinese pipa, he can also play several Western musical instruments well. He is also a seasoned golfer.

The ambassador's wife is named Jane Beck, and she and their two children now live in Beiping. Speaking of Beiping, it is also where the ambassador got married. Originally, in 1931, the ambassador's wife and her brother were traveling around the world, and when they arrived in Beiping, it happened that the wife's family and the ambassador's family had been friends for three generations, so she stayed at the embassy. One day, the single minister suddenly notified his friends that he would marry Miss Jane at six o'clock the next day. Thus, she became his wife.

When the ambassador was in Chongqing, he would get up at seven in the morning, eat a hearty breakfast, and then take a sedan chair carried by four people to the embassy to work. There, he had to read and answer more than forty telegrams from all over China. At night, he would occasionally invite guests for a purely male dinner, or he would read some light reading and go to bed.

The ambassador's life is very difficult. He might be awakened in the middle of the night by an air raid siren, and hurriedly take refuge in an air raid shelter. The embassy has a solid air raid shelter, but if it were directly hit by a bomb, it would also be reduced to powder. Last time the ambassador inspected the Yangtze River, there were rumors against the ambassador, but fortunately nothing happened. For the sake of the close friendship between China and the United States, we respectfully wish Ambassador Johnson safety and health!

Education

### German Spy Training

— Qing

Spies, because they are entrusted with special missions, must be strictly selected. Moreover, they need to undergo a long period of training in order to become accomplished spies.

In peacetime, spy training is usually the responsibility of specialized personnel; in wartime, it is the responsibility of experienced veteran spies.

German spy training is relatively strict and scientific because Germany has specialized schools for training spies, especially the special intelligence class attached to the Army University in Berlin, Germany. Their students are directly designated by the Minister of the Army from the graduates of the Army University, and the course is two years. Their courses are: 1. History of Intelligence Development; 2. Organization of Intelligence; 3. Strategy and Planning of Intelligence; 4. Technology and Knowledge; 5. Importance and Methods of Reconnaissance; 6. Psychology; 7. Photography; 8. Human Biometrics; 9. Foreign Languages. There is also a practical work period of three to six months, and their future positions are determined based on the quality of their performance in this practical work.

Germany not only conducts rigorous training domestically but also has specialized schools for training spies in various legions. Their courses are: 1. Organization of Enemy Forces; 2. Identification of Enemy Forces; 3. Identification of Weapon Calibers; 4. Characteristics of Fortified Positions; 5. Identification of Maps and Terrain; 6. Explosives; 7. Confessions After Being Captured. These lessons are all taught orally and vary depending on the individual because they are determined by the country to which the trainee will be sent. As for the length of their graduation period, important spies generally undergo training for two to three weeks to a month or a month and a half; unimportant scouts only undergo training for about ten days to three weeks.

Various Thoughts

### University Education

— Jia Shu

The famous British educator Henry Newman said: "The purpose of university education is to raise the intellectual level of society, to train the thinking of the general public, to clarify the tastes of the nation, to improve the spirit of the times, and to beautify the lives of individuals... It is to train people to be competent in various positions and familiar with various things."

He also said: "A university student must have a clear mind, a correct point of view, and eloquent speech; he knows when to speak or remain silent, he can accurately ask or answer questions, he can speak, listen, be serious, and be humorous..."

I do not expect that our university education can achieve these goals one hundred percent, and that all our university students can meet these standards. No, I only hope that they truly "educate for the sake of education" and produce fewer bookworms who only know how to "follow the rules" and "obey orders", or treasures who spend all day watching movies and running to dance halls. That would be fortunate indeed.

Overseas Art Scene

### Lin Yutang Plans to Build a Theater to Perform Various Dramas and Promote Chinese Art

— Qiu Wen

The Chinese theater, built by overseas Chinese in America on Duster Street in New York, is expected to be fully completed in the middle of this month since construction began in July of last year. It is reported that the initiators of the construction of the theater are the writer Lin Yutang and Gu Baowei, and all the construction costs and expenses are allocated by the American Chinese Drama Association, with an estimated cost of 550,000 US dollars. Later, because the association's public reserve fund for the 29th year was insufficient, it was temporarily changed to 450,000 US dollars. The entire structure of the theater is modeled after the three-dimensional pattern of the American Astoke Theater, so it is extremely magnificent. It is said that after the establishment of the theater in the future, two Chinese art exhibition rooms will be opened on the third floor, specializing in displaying Chinese artistic works from past generations. As for the performance of dramas, the Chinese Drama Club and the Chinese Drama Theater will take turns performing various Chinese dramas in the theater every Saturday to promote Chinese art.

### A Unique Ice Skating Blockbuster – Ice Tree Silver Flower

— Yun

This is a silver flower among ice skating blockbusters. It appears on the silver screen with a newer look. The ice skating scene is entirely colorful, undoubtedly creating an unprecedented film miracle. The sensation of "Ice Tree Silver Flower" throughout Shanghai is an inevitable fact.

The main characters are Joan Crawford, Thomas Stewart, and Louis Ares, three major stars. The male and female stars performing ice skating are the internationally renowned Universal Ice Show. All the male and female actors have undergone considerably hard training over the years and have divine performances. The dance skills in this film have a different style than any previous ice skating film. It integrates grand and delicate styles, including an Indian tribal dance, a Mother Goose waltz, a comedic mandarin duck dance, and a demonic tango. The entire film is filled with natural colors, presenting a more beautiful visual experience.

The plot is full of tragic elements. It fully reveals the suffering of the artists. The wife joins a film company, and the company creates her star status but with a strange condition: she must remain single until the end. As a result, a married couple can only treat each other as strangers in front of the crowd. The pain in their hearts can be imagined. Joan Crawford sings "Something's Gotta Happen Soon" in "Ice Tree Silver Flower", which is worth listening to by every movie fan.

### Drums Along the Mohawk

— Qi Hua

"Drums Along the Mohawk" depicts the arduous struggles that the United States of America went through in its early days. The playwright unfolds a page of righteous history on a newly married couple. At the same time, for the first time in American movies, it shows the Indian's superficial hatred of white people, with a backstage instigator. Their actions are merely puppets for people to drive.

We are naturally very happy to see such a movie because it shows us that building a free country requires finding a path to peace from thorns. The situation when the United States was founded is exactly the era we are in now.

But the distribution of this play is a case of the guest overshadowing the host. For example, the scene of Claudette Colbert giving birth is an unimportant scene in the entire play, and it should be even more determined to go through the final pass after the volunteers return. Its best description of the joy of the crowd and Henry Fonda's surprise at becoming a father for the first time will relax the subsequent play; although this scene alone is a very exciting scene.

As for the director John Ford, he made a mistake by accepting and depicting the humorous aspects of this script. For example, Olive attempts to protect her bed after the Indians enter the room; when the enemy attacks, she turns to another scene because of her death. All of this reduces the value of the script itself, and at the same time, the entire play loses its cohesive power.

Henry Fonda is calm and powerful. I think Claudette Colbert is suitable for comedies.

### Anecdotes from the Peking Opera World

— Xu Muyun

Yang Xiaolou Also Admires Li Chunlai (Part 1)

Recently, there has been a lack of talent in the opera world, and it is even more difficult to find talent in the Sheng (male) and Wusheng (martial male) roles. In the past, it was still felt that the Beijing Chaopai (Beijing style) was slightly better, but now it cannot be said that. Let's take Zhou Xinfang as an example. Apart from his husky voice, which makes it difficult to compare his singing with that of the northern performers, his acting style, expressions, and physical skills are indeed better than those of Ma Lianliang, Tan Xinpei, and others. At the same time, his skills are also highly praised by the Pingjiao (opera critics), which shows that as long as the goods are genuine, you don't have to worry about not being appreciated by connoisseurs. I still remember twenty years ago when the Tianchan Stage on Erma Road in this city invited Xiaolou to perform in the south, the veteran performer Li Chunlai happened to be on the same stage as Yang. At that time, Chunlai was already over sixty years old and had lost his teeth, while Xiaolou was in his middle age and was at the height of his singing career. Although the two belonged to the Taishan Beidou (leading figures) in the northern and southern Wusheng roles, Li was good at short fighting and followed the Huang Pang (Yueshan) style, while Yang was good at performing in long costumes and inherited the mantle of Mao Bao (Yu Jusheng). The so-called "well water does not interfere with river water," each had their own specialties. Xiaolou had long admired Li's name. It was said that in his heyday, he often brought dozens of supporting actors with him, including the so-called "Hum and Ha Generals," "Four Vajras," and "Thirty-Six Somersaults." For example, the veteran performer Shen Yunqiu, who in his later years performed in Yi Wu Hao (A Righteous and Heroic Hero) for a long time, was one of the Hum and Ha Generals. Also, Tan Yongkui, who would open his mouth and jump, Wu Jing (martial male painted face) Li Deshan, Ju Dekui, Wu Dan (martial female) Qi Caifen, Shui Shang Piao, and others, all followed Li in performances, listed as one of the Vajras. Later, after Gai Jiaotian succeeded Chunlai as the priest of the southern short fighting Wusheng, Shen, Li, Qi, and others were recruited by Gai Lao Wu (Gai Jiaotian), also taking the meaning of being familiar with the road.
