### Chongqing Newspaper Hopes Allied Nations Will Forgo Petty Grievances

Chongqing: According to an editorial in today's Shishi Xinbao, Japan is making a big fuss over the Soviet-Japanese military conflict on Sakhalin Island, clearly showing its overtures to Britain and France. Its purpose is nothing more than to establish a new relationship with Britain and France and then continue to plot against China. Although we firmly believe that Britain and France will not fall for the Japanese trick, we cannot but take precautions. Speaking of the Soviet Union, the newspaper said that Germany and Italy have already strengthened their friendship with the Soviet Union. Why can't Britain and France restore friendship with the Soviet Union? The matter is incomprehensible. We hope that all friendly countries will forgo petty grievances and not allow Japan to monopolize China's actions. This is the best policy. It is also reported that after the signing of the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty, Japan has transferred troops from various battle lines to the border of "Manchukuo". (16th Associated Press Dispatch)

### National Socialist Party States Its Position

Chongqing: The National Socialist Party cadres in Chongqing issued a declaration stating the party's solemn stance. Zhang Jun delivered the declaration to the Central News Agency, which stated: Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War on August 13, our party members believe that this is a critical moment for the survival of the nation, and it is unjustifiable to engage in internal strife and consume the country's strength. Therefore, following the precedent of national unity in wartime in general, we support the government's policy of resistance against Japan. However, in December 1938, Wang Jingwei suddenly fled the country and extended his hand to the Japanese for peace talks. Our party members believe that the source of this war lies in the Japanese occupation of Northeast China on September 18, and the subsequent endless invasion. If Japan truly wants peace, it should withdraw its troops and retreat from the occupied areas, and everything can be easily resolved, and peace can be achieved easily. If there is a faction within us advocating for peace, it will not only cause division of opinions and dispersal of strength, but there is also no hope for a victorious peace agreement. Moreover, a country negotiating peace with others must hold military power itself, so that it can make peace if it is suitable or continue fighting if it is not. Now, if a person is unarmed, the power of life and death is in the hands of others. This kind of peace negotiation method is unprecedented in world history. In the past, the Rhine region of Germany, incited by the French, attempted to secede from the German government, but the result was ultimately extinction. Therefore, the fate of the puppet government in Nanjing can be predicted. It is heard that there are people in Shanghai who have issued a declaration in the name of the "National Socialist Party Political Affairs Special Committee" to support it, which is clearly an act of stealing the name. Since its establishment, our party has always remembered the great righteousness of the nation above all else, only hoping to establish an independent government with the country's own strength. We are unwilling to participate in any other out-of-bounds actions. This is a special declaration. (18th Dispatch)

Editorial

### Japan's Political Offensive

The military offensive fails, and what follows is inevitably a political offensive. This "spinning around" tactic has long been Japan's consistent approach to China. Now, General Abe has been internally designated as the "Special Envoy to China," and the so-called "New Central Government" is already underway. Before long, perhaps the strange drama of 1932 in Changchun, where the then Special Envoy to the puppet Manchuria signed a protocol recognizing the puppet Manchuria, will be re-enacted by Abe and reappear today. Regardless of its effectiveness, Japan is using this program as its last-ditch effort. When it is impossible to conquer China by force and there is no effect in undermining the policy of resistance, it has no choice but to bring out this old program, which has been postponed again and again, to make a last-ditch attempt. Japan's fantasy is to build its so-called "New Order in East Asia" through such a new regime, adjust Sino-Japanese relations, and achieve its final goal of resolving the "China Incident" and completing its economic aggression against China. But first: Today's situation of full-scale resistance is definitely different from the previous local wars. Japan's previous tricks in the puppet Manchuria could take advantage of the appearance of a puppet regime, the temporary forced retreat of a part of the Chinese army, and the opportunity to catch its breath and prepare for further aggression. However, since the outbreak of the full-scale war at the Marco Polo Bridge, this situation has completely changed. China will not stop resisting Japan until the invading army is driven out, and it will never allow it to catch its breath again and fall into the tragedy of national subjugation. From the highest generals to the common people in the streets, this point is very clear. Japan has never stopped wanting to use force to make China yield and end the war as soon as possible. But the collapse of the Xiangbei offensive and the failure of the Nanning Campaign proved that it is impossible for the Japanese army to defeat the main force of the Chinese army in the mountainous southwest and reach a treaty of surrender. The disastrous defeat at Binyang forced the Japanese army to retreat to the suburbs of Nanning again, and the strategic areas around Nanning were recaptured by the Chinese army. Not only was the momentum of the offensive greatly reduced, but also the defense line of Nanning was in danger. Heavy Chinese forces are currently surrounding the suburbs of Nanning, and there are also mobile units of the Chinese army in the rear of Yongqin, constantly attacking. Advancing would inevitably repeat the previous mistakes, and retreating would lead to the danger of being intercepted by the Chinese army, which is densely deployed in the rear. The Japanese army has now taken a defensive posture in Nanning and is taking an offensive posture towards Lingshan County on the border between Guangdong and Guangxi. This is not a new change in the Japanese army's strategy, but it is enough to say that in order to protect Nanning and the security of its rear, the Japanese army has no choice but to "eliminate" the Chinese army threatening its flank first in order to seek its own safety. Therefore, judging from the situation in Guinan, the Japanese army has fallen from the sharp momentum of the offensive to the declining trend of retreat. By analogy, since the Japanese army has not made large-scale progress in Central China, and the Chinese army's position has remained unshaken after the Japanese army has repeatedly invaded Zhongtiao Mountain in Shanxi, it is sufficient to show that the two armies of China and Japan have entered a stage of stalemate. The longer the stalemate lasts, the greater the losses suffered by Japan will be, and the faster it will collapse. Japan cannot destroy the main force of the Chinese army, and even if it creates hundreds and thousands of unarmed puppet organizations, the effect it gets is fundamentally equal to zero. Therefore, the characteristics of the current full-scale war cannot be compared with the previous local wars. In the past, Japan could temporarily gain a breather through a puppet organization, but now it has become a dream to gain it from its future puppet organization. Second: One more point that must be clearly understood is that Japan could buy over Zhang Hai Peng and other powerful figures to drive them to achieve the goal of controlling the Chinese with Chinese in the invasion of the three northeastern provinces. However, today, military generals and lower-level soldiers with patriotic ideas are all risking their lives and sacrificing themselves for the country, and no one has been tempted by bribes and willingly lost their integrity and surrendered. What the Japanese puppets can use is only those fallen old warlords and one or two base and frustrated military men. The army they recruit is also a group of bandits and rogues, which is not enough to withstand a single blow from the regular army. The recent failure of the puppet army bought over by Huang Dawei in the Chao-Shan area is proof of this. These bandit armies are the strength cultivated by the Japanese side, and the outcome they have obtained is like this, which clearly proves Japan's intention to control the Chinese with Chinese. Third: Japan has established a so-called "New Central Government" and attempted to use this new organization to threaten other countries and cut off aid to China, in addition to its own recognition. A Japanese naval spokesperson stated on the 14th of this month that "if a third country continues to sympathize with and provide aid to the Chongqing government, the new regime will exclude all rights of the third country." This was in response to the recent loan of US$20 million to China by the United States. However, the United States has loaned a large sum of money to China despite the establishment of this new regime, which proves that the importance of China's resistance has been recognized by the international community, because the victory of China's resistance is not only the victory of democratic forces, but also the victory of the world's good order. President Roosevelt of the United States has repeatedly condemned countries that use aggression as a means, and it is obvious that he will not be deterred by Japan's actions. In short, Japan's tricks are nothing more than deceiving itself and others. It cannot change the world's views and cannot harm China in the slightest. This has become an ironclad fact.

Berlin: According to sources here, today's meeting between Mussolini and Hitler was the fifth such talk between the two dictators. Preparations for this meeting were swift and absolutely discreet, which is always sufficient to demonstrate the harmony between the Fascist Party and the National Socialist Party. Each of the two leaders was accompanied by a small group of strategists, who always accompany them on their travels. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)

Berlin: Officials here stated at 11 PM last night that the meeting between Hitler and Mussolini had been planned for some time. Ribbentrop's recent trip to Rome was to discuss the procedures for the meeting. Hitler and Mussolini were scheduled to meet at the Brenner Pass on the morning of the 18th. (Havas dispatch, 18th)

(Reuters dispatch, 18th)

Paris: Although the news of the meeting between Hitler and Mussolini came as a surprise, commentators here believe that this plan had been in the works between Berlin and Rome for some time. Pertinax declared in L'Ordre yesterday that a peace offensive was imminent. Mussolini and Hitler, behind the scenes, believe that they can use Welles as an intermediary to get President Roosevelt involved and feel smug. The Journal de Paris stated that Mussolini and Hitler will work according to a carefully prepared plan, possibly manipulated by the diplomatic intrigues conducted by the German government in Southeastern Europe in recent days. L'Ere Nouvelle also stated that rumors that Hitler intends to have closer cooperation between Germany and Italy to prevent the reddening of the Balkans, in order to win the favor of President Roosevelt and the Pope to come forward and mediate, are not entirely without basis. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)

London: Well-informed sources here recently stated that when Italian Premier Mussolini holds talks with German Führer Hitler today, he will try his best to persuade him to make significant changes to the current situation in Czechoslovakia and Poland, bringing it closer to the views of Britain and France. However, the general public does not rate the results of this talk too highly, saying that in the view of Britain and France, even if Germany makes significant concessions on the issues of Czechoslovakia and Poland, it cannot be regarded as meeting the preconditions for peace talks. (Havas dispatch, 18th)

Paris: Political figures here were not very surprised to hear that Italian Premier Mussolini is scheduled to meet with German Führer Hitler tomorrow, and said that according to diplomatic sources, the leaders of Germany and Italy had long decided to meet somewhere in early spring this year. This matter was reportedly initiated by Germany, with the goal of ascertaining to what extent Italy can take action to supplement Germany's actions. It is difficult to say whether this meeting between the leaders of Germany and Italy will launch a new "peace offensive," but one thing is certain: Germany's actions, and the meeting between the leaders of Germany and Italy, show that their ambition to control Europe has not diminished in the slightest. As for Premier Mussolini, he firmly believes that Britain and France are determined to fight to the end and will only make peace after all their objectives have been achieved. For this reason, Italy will not initiate anything without the consent of the United States, hoping to end the current war. (Havas dispatch, 17th)

New York: The New York Volkszeitung stated that "Mussolini and Hitler may only discuss the Balkan Peninsula issue, but they will certainly issue peace proposals to shake the nerves of Britain and France and confuse American public opinion. This is what the dictators are good at, but the democratic countries are now fighting based on the basic principles of conscience and strength, that is, freedom of speech and freedom of will. This is what the United States should be aware of." (Havas dispatch, 18th)

Rome: Observers here recently stated that the meeting between Premier Mussolini and German Führer Hitler at the border between Germany and Italy was agreed upon in a long-distance phone call yesterday. Because after exchanging views with US Undersecretary of State Welles, Mussolini believed that the timing was very opportune to mediate between Germany and Britain and France, so he arranged to meet Hitler in order to discuss peace issues. (Havas dispatch, 17th)

Berlin: Although German officials have taken a cautious and silent stance on the talks between Hitler and Mussolini, the Börsen-Zeitung declared that the people of the world are focused on the meeting between the German Führer and the Italian Premier, knowing that their words and decisions are in agreement with each other and are not only related to Germany and Italy, but also have an impact on all of Europe. The impact of this meeting will inevitably be seen in reality sooner or later. (Havas dispatch, 18th)

Washington: Political circles are now focused on the meeting between Hitler and Mussolini, but so far there is no indication that US Undersecretary of State Welles is involved. People in the State Department do not want to criticize this, but well-informed people in political circles believe that this meeting is more due to Germany's efforts to create a peace movement and less due to Italy's efforts to join its allies in the war. It is generally believed that this meeting may allow Mussolini to tell Hitler the last words he gave to Welles, and according to recent news from Italy, none of them indicate that this talk between the two leaders is a preparation for any overt resistance to Britain and France.

### American Newspaper on Peace Issues

New York: The New York Times stated that "President Roosevelt's speech has explained the views of most Americans on the conditions for a 'genuine peace.' In essence, a genuine peace should be based on a moral foundation. We must have a good grasp of whether the United States is prepared to join the great powers in providing guarantees to small countries so that they will not be subjected to aggression, so that we can have the right to speak on finding a peaceful solution in the future."

### Fourteen German Planes Attack Scottish Coast, Attempt to Bomb Forth Bridge Fails, Over One Hundred Bombs Dropped in Scapa Flow

London: It is reported that on Sunday night, German planes attempted to bomb naval and military targets throughout the Scottish coast. German bombers planned to fly to the Forth Bridge, but were repelled by British fighter planes before they could get close. When German planes raided Scapa Flow in the Orkney Islands, one civilian was killed. This is the first civilian to die in Orkney from an air raid. The person lived near the Stronsay civilian airfield and was killed by a high-explosive bomb when looking out the door at the bullets flying and anti-aircraft shells exploding. The bomb was one of nineteen bombs dropped by a fleeing German plane. The person left behind a wife and a child. Two male neighbors standing at the door were also injured by the bomb. The thatched roof of an old woman's cottage was destroyed, and the old woman crawled out of the rubble and collapsed on the way. Another woman and an old man were also injured. Few people sought shelter during the raid, preferring to witness the largest air raid that Orkney and Scapa Flow had ever experienced. German planes dropped over fifty high-explosive bombs and dozens of smaller incendiary bombs in West Orkney. Windows in the area were shattered, and the fragments flew to a height of 20 to 40 feet. Residents then ran into air-raid shelters to avoid them. German planes then flew over Kirkwall at a low altitude of 2,000 feet. At that time, the entire area was illuminated by a terrifying flash of gunfire, and explosions occurred every few minutes. Last night, the British naval community stated that only small encounters occurred over Scapa Flow. The German commander is eager to exaggerate this and falsely claim to have damaged British warships, which is enough to show his nervous instability and childish psychology of exaggerating victory. It is widely recognized that the eastern and northern bases of Britain are vulnerable to air raids, but we are confident that we will perform well in the course of the war. Only a small number of the planes sent out by the enemy to attack flew here to bomb, and the rest must have gotten lost. This is of great significance, and the German planes that arrived in Britain also did not dare to confront the gunfire of warships and artillery, and were only satisfied with harming civilians in small villages five or six miles from the port. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)

London: According to reliable sources, fourteen German planes flew to Scapa Flow in northern Scotland at 7:50 PM last night and dropped bombs until 9:15 PM, dropping a total of over one hundred bombs. (Havas dispatch, 17th)

London: The German air raid on Scapa Flow was the first incident causing civilian casualties since the outbreak of the European war. It is believed that there will be a fierce air war between Britain and Germany because of this. Yesterday, the British expeditionary force on the French front cancelled leave for soldiers. At the same time, the British newspapers urged the government to step up the war against Germany. Observers said that the appeal of the press will be greatly supported by the people, and there will be a fierce debate in the House of Commons this week. The British people first heard the news of the Scapa Flow air raid from the radio report at 1:00 PM yesterday. "German planes attacked at 7:30 PM the night before after three days of reconnaissance. One British warship was damaged." The German report stated that four warships were hit, but the British Admiralty denied this. (Associated Press dispatch, 18th)

London: Prime Minister Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons this afternoon that when he makes a statement on the war situation on schedule tomorrow, he will involve the German air raid on Scapa Flow. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)

Copenhagen: A German bomber that crashed on the Danish island of Lolland in the Baltic Sea yesterday had a famous picture of British Prime Minister Chamberlain's umbrella painted on its side.

German Squadron Leader Talks About the Air Raid

Berlin: Major Döenitz, the squadron leader of the German Air Force who led the bombing of Scapa Flow the day before, met with foreign journalists yesterday and issued a statement on the bombing of the bay, saying that there were four of the largest British warships in the bay, each of which was hit by at least one heavy bomb. We saw it very clearly when it hit. He then described the details as follows: We have known for several days that there are many British ships in the bay. The weather was clear on the 16th. When we flew to the bay, it was already dusk. The British must have been at dinner, because we had been there for a long time before we heard the sound of anti-aircraft guns, which clearly showed that they had discovered us very late. Although British fighter planes took off to pursue us, they did not achieve much. I personally saw a huge ship engulfed in a cloud of black smoke after being hit, followed by a very intense fire. The bombing was completed at 7:55 PM. We flew back north and saw the four large warships hit and smoking along the way, which was very clear. At the same time, there were still many bullets near some warships. According to Döenitz, the German planes that went to bomb the bay were Heinkel He 111s, all of which returned to base safely. (Havas dispatch, 18th)

Berlin: The British said that one German plane was shot down during the German Air Force bombing of Scapa Flow. Berlin officials declared that all the German planes that went to bomb returned to base safely. If a plane was shot down, it must have been a British plane. (Havas dispatch, 18th)

Berlin: Berlin officials attached great importance to the German Air Force's bombing of the British Scapa Flow air base, believing that Britain's attempt to use the bay to control Norwegian territorial waters had clearly failed. The Sonntags-Zeitung published an editorial stating that "The entire German people firmly believe that the outcome of this war can be determined militarily. The success of the Scapa Flow air raid is the first major blow against the British air force base." (Havas dispatch, 18th)

Without warning, they indiscriminately strafed with machine guns. The crew abandoned their nets and hurriedly sailed north, but the planes kept chasing them for about an hour and dropped several bombs, fortunately none of which hit. Although the fishing boat was hit by machine gun bullets, all the crew members were unharmed and returned to port yesterday. (Havas dispatch, 18th)

Bern: Today, foreign planes intruded into Swiss airspace twice. The first time was at 10:56 AM, when a foreign plane appeared near Basel and then flew west via Delémont. At 11:40 AM, another foreign plane appeared near Dübendorf in Zurich. The local anti-aircraft artillery fired twice, and several fighter planes also took off to pursue them. (Havas dispatch, 18th)

Oslo: Officials announced that several foreign planes intruded into the airspace of Bergen, Norway yesterday. Because they were flying very high, it was impossible to identify their nationality. The local anti-aircraft artillery fired, and the planes hurriedly fled west. (Havas dispatch, 18th)

Paris: In the past 24 hours, a battle occurred in an area west of the Vosges on the Western Front. A French "free corps" (a small team of soldiers volunteering for dangerous work) and a German team of about 200 people clashed in no man's land. The battle was fierce, and as a result, the German army was damaged and retreated. Two French soldiers were missing. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)

### Finland and Soviet Union to Exchange Ratification Documents Tomorrow, Finnish Representatives Depart for Moscow to Conduct Border Demarcation and Economic Negotiations

Helsinki: Minister of State Paasikivi, along with Foreign Minister Väinö Voionmaa, departed for Moscow this morning, scheduled to exchange ratification documents of the peace treaty with the Soviet authorities on the 20th. At the same time, they will also conduct negotiations with the Soviet Union on issues related to the re-demarcation of the border between the two countries, the restoration of diplomatic relations, and economic matters. (Havas dispatch, 18th)

Helsinki: The Finnish-Soviet peace treaty stipulates that the Hanko Peninsula will be leased to the Soviet Union for 30 years. Observers here commented that the Soviet Union did not ask the Finnish government for land transit rights, so Soviet naval bases will have to maintain transportation with the Hanko Peninsula by sea. However, in winter, the sea in that area is completely frozen, and transportation is difficult. In addition, the administration of the Hanko Peninsula and other issues have not been resolved. Finnish representative Paasikivi will arrive in Moscow on the 19th of this month to exchange ratification documents for the peace treaty, and he will definitely discuss these issues with the Soviet authorities. (Havas dispatch, 17th)

Sydney: Australian Prime Minister Menzies said today that the Australian government is currently considering a plan for the large-scale migration of Finnish people to Australia. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)

### Large Number of Australian Youth Enlist in Air Force

Canberra: Australia needs to select 55,000 personnel in the Empire Air Training Scheme. 200,000 people are now enlisting and waiting for examination. According to Australian Minister for Air Fairbairn, the estimate of 200,000 people enlisting is based on facts, because air force personnel must have a certain level of education and physical fitness, and most need to have expertise. Even with lenient admission, the number of unqualified applicants will reach as high as 75%. Currently, there are 47,957 people enlisting to be ground and maintenance personnel for the air force, and 8,500 people enlisting to be pilots and other positions on the plane. This proves that Australian youth are very interested in aviation, but not all those who enlist can be admitted. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)

### American Attention: National Defense Science

Washington: According to local newspaper reports, the US government has solicited scientific assistance from the Carnegie Institution of Washington for a highly confidential national defense plan.

### Zetland Recovers from Injury; Attends the House of Lords

London: The Secretary of State for India, Lord Zetland, who was slightly injured in the Caxton Hall shooting recently, attended the House of Lords this afternoon for the first time and addressed the assembly. He said that he had heard from various sources that the incident might influence the British government's decisions on Indian affairs. He expressed his regret for this speculation. However, since various parties have expressed this concern, he intends to publicly reiterate what he has said privately more than once: that the actions of a single violent individual will definitely not have the slightest impact on the British government's decisions on Indian affairs. (Applause) (Reuters, 18th)

### British and French Aid Plan for Turkey: Butler Answers Question in the House of Commons

London: During today's session of the House of Commons, a question was raised to Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Butler, asking whether there was a comprehensive plan between Britain and France to provide immediate military assistance to Turkey should its integrity be threatened or should it need to aid its neighbors. Mr. Butler replied that Britain and France are bound by a mutual assistance treaty. In the event that Turkey is drawn into war due to a European power or is invaded by such a power, they will do their utmost to provide all possible assistance. The form of this assistance has been mutually discussed by the three governments. (Reuters, 17th)

Tokyo: When questioned by journalists today about the true situation regarding the Tianjin silver issue, a spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry replied that his previous statements, similar to those made by the British Ambassador to Tokyo on the 16th of this month, had clarified the situation. However, negotiations between Britain and Japan are still ongoing, and it is hoped that a compromise will be reached soon. The spokesman stated that reports about a resolution regarding the Tianjin silver issue being reached or about to be reached are unfounded. Negotiations have been underway for several months, but significant disputes remain to be overcome before a compromise can truly be expected. (Reuters, 18th)

### Quo Tai-chi on Sino-British Friendship: British Appeasement of Japan Will Affect Friendship with China

London: Chinese Ambassador to Britain, Quo Tai-chi, recently stated, "Britain needs the friendship of China, but if it adopts an excessively 'appeasement' policy towards Japan, this friendship will inevitably suffer a serious blow." Japan's plans in Asia and the Western Pacific are aimed at Britain, France, the United States, the Netherlands, and the Soviet Union, and are not solely directed at China. (Havas, 17th)

### Japan and Argentina Conduct Economic Negotiations

Tokyo: The official announcement that Japan and Argentina have reached an understanding to initiate and immediately implement a barter system has been welcomed by the business community here.

The first seven members of the Argentine economic mission arrived in Shenyang this morning and immediately proceeded to Dalian. They will travel to Changchun on the 23rd of this month. (Reuters, 18th)

### Japanese Mail Steamer "Fushimi Maru" Subjected to Inspection: Japan to Protest to Britain

Tokyo: On the night of the 17th, the Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK Line) received a telegram from the "Fushimi Maru" stating that the ship was inspected by British authorities in Singapore on the 16th and that some of its mail was seized. The telegram stated that when the "Fushimi Maru" arrived in Singapore at 11:00 AM on the 16th, inspection officers demanded the handover of sixty-four pieces of mail destined for disembarkation at Naples, Italy. The ship, having no other choice, consulted with the consulate and handed over the mail on the condition that it be returned before the ship's departure. Fifty-two pieces were subsequently returned, but twelve pieces of mail bound for Germany were not returned because the inspection procedures had not been completed. Despite lodging a serious protest with the consul general, the authorities refused to return the mail, and the ship was forced to depart. The ship departed Yokohama on the 26th and was illegally inspected by the British en route in Singapore. Upon receiving the telegram, the Foreign Ministry decided to lodge a serious protest immediately. (Domei News Agency, 18th)

### London Stock Exchange Announces Minimum Prices for Public Bonds

London: The Council of the London Stock Exchange announced today the minimum prices for some government bonds, effective from March 18th, and stated that the revised minimum prices for other government bonds will be announced shortly. The announced minimum prices are lower than the closing prices on Friday. It is reported that interest accrued up to the present was taken into account when setting the minimum prices. (Reuters, 18th)

London: The new minimum prices for British government bonds announced today have surprised people at the Stock Exchange, but generally it is admitted that this step should have been taken earlier, as top-tier bonds have risen to the original minimum prices, which were set last August. People here generally believe that these new prices are a step towards stabilizing wartime finance based on a 3% interest rate. However, the London Stock Exchange opened quietly, with brokers wishing to thoroughly study the situation before offering advice to clients. (Reuters, 18th)

### Pawnshops Surge Across Japan

Tokyo Flight Dispatch: According to statistics released by the Ministry of Health and Welfare, Japan saw a decrease in pawnshops in major cities since the outbreak of the China Incident. Not fearing the long duration of the war and the difficulty of people's livelihood, pawnshops across the country have surged again. Salaried workers often see pawning as a normal practice. Ordinary laborers even pawn items for drinking pleasure. Intellectuals, due to the soaring prices of daily necessities, often pawn items to buy rice and food. There are approximately 1,200 pawnshops across Japan, with a total capital of approximately 16 million yen. The amount of money pawned annually in Tokyo pawnshops ranges from 80 million to 100 million yen. The value of items pledged at ordinary times is also between 25 million and 30 million yen. However, valuable items such as gold watches and rings have mostly been collected by the government during donation campaigns, and are rarely seen in pawnshops. (Havas)

### All India Congress Opens; Leaders of Various Factions Express Opinions

Ranchi, India: The All India Congress Committee convened here today. Twenty-seven amendments to the Patna Resolution were proposed, including one by Communist representative Batve, advocating political non-cooperation and resistance against British military operations. Communist leader Roy, in explaining his amendment, advocated the immediate establishment of an Indian democratic republic to replace the current government, and severing diplomatic relations with the British government. Gandhi arrived at the meeting at 4:00 PM and will deliver a speech. (United Press, 18th)

Ranchi, India: Indian Communist leader Roy, upon arriving here today, told reporters that Gandhi's policy towards England was too weak. "Our goal is complete independence. We must have the determination to fight for our independence, rather than carefully select the means to achieve independence. Roy believes that now is a golden opportunity for India to seek independence, with England occupied in Western Europe. When asked whether India will adopt the same political line as the United States in the future, Roy replied, "American politics is not democratic politics. Everything in America is in the hands of financiers and industrialists. Roy sighed, stating he had lived in the United States for some time, and also visited the Soviet Union and Mexico. However, Nehru, the nationalist leader of young India, supported Gandhi's proposal, saying, "We must continue to prepare psychologically so that when Gandhi deems the time ripe for the national independence movement, we are ready to act. We are all united on Gandhi's fundamental principles of independence. The only difference is whether Gandhi's plan can be realized." When discussing Gandhi's advocacy of being too moderate, Nehru said, "Although Gandhi's words are moderate, his actions are often stronger than his words. Gandhi sometimes deliberately adopts a moderate tone in his speech." He also said that the All India Congress had only been a protest group in the past, but in recent years, it has assumed administrative responsibilities in some provinces. It is reported that Gandhi will deliver a speech at the All India Congress this week. (United Press, 18th)

### Germany and the Soviet Union Seek to Expand Control over Northern Europe; Small Countries Begin Political Activities; Balkan Countries Unite

Stockholm, Sweden: Following the Soviet-Finnish armistice, the Nordic countries have begun unprecedented diplomatic and political activities. Two points are now clearly visible: (1) Germany and the Soviet Union are both seeking to exploit the anxieties of the Nordic countries to expand their control over Northern Europe; (2) There is fierce debate in Northern Europe about the merits of the Soviet-Finnish settlement, and the internal political situations of some Nordic countries may be affected. It is widely believed that Germany also hopes to participate in the defense alliance proposed by Finland to Sweden and Norway. The arrival of two German officials here at the end of the week is likely related to the current political situation. According to well-informed observers, Germany is currently doubling its propaganda efforts to portray Britain and France as attempting to turn the Scandinavian Peninsula into a battlefield, and is attempting to induce the Nordic countries to seek self-preservation under German protection. It is reported that the attitude of the Scandinavian countries towards this German movement can be expressed in the phrase "Do not separate us from our friends." As for the Soviet Union's efforts to expand its influence, they are even less welcome. (Reuters, 18th)

The Hague: A Berlin correspondent for a local newspaper reports that Germany appears to have begun a campaign to exclude Britain from the Scandinavian market. Using the recent trade agreements concluded by Britain with Norway and Sweden as an excuse, the German government is engaging in urgent negotiations with the Scandinavian countries, explaining the need for true neutrality and stating that Germany can purchase more raw materials and food from the Nordic countries than Britain. While people in Berlin describe these agreements as Britain's attempt to compensate for its diplomatic failure with Finland, they feel that Britain intends to use these agreements to gain control of the Scandinavian coast and have declared that if the Nordic countries allow British warships to exercise this right, it will be a breach of neutrality equivalent to accepting British instigation to stop the exchange of goods with Germany. (Reuters, 18th)

Stockholm, Sweden: The "Evening News" reports from Moscow that in addition to negotiating a trade agreement with Finland, the Soviet government also intends to negotiate trade and transit agreements with Norway and Sweden, so that Soviet goods can pass through the territories of the two countries and be transported to their western ports. At the same time, they also intend to request that the countries designate free ports for Soviet trade. (Havas, 17th)

London: According to special dispatches here, Dr. Brant, a former professor at the University of Berlin and currently a professor at Stanford University in the United States, recently published an article stating that if the Allied powers deal with Germany through delaying tactics, the war may be prolonged, but Germany will inevitably fail. Germany can resist the blockade for at least two years under the current war situation. The Soviet Union cannot provide Germany with much assistance because it has not yet satisfied its own needs, and the railways of the Soviet Union and Germany cannot transport oil on a large scale. Germany's difficult problem is the supply of oil. Only with insufficient oil can it not wage a large-scale land war for a long time. What will be the consequences depends largely on the nature of the war in the future. If the Allied powers engage in delays and do not seek a quick battle, the war cannot be ended in a short time, and Germany will eventually fail. It is estimated that in the third or fourth year of the war, Britain and France will be able to destroy the German army with superior military strength.

New York Dispatch: Analyzing the position of the small countries and the pressures forcing them to unite, it states that this evolution is currently underway in the Scandinavian Peninsula, but even in the Balkan Peninsula, countries fearing German and Soviet aggression will gradually change their inherent adversarial attitudes towards each other, and their alliances will eventually tend to be anti-German and anti-Soviet. This is something we must not forget, as the dangers faced by the independence of the small countries of Europe do not come from the Allied powers, but from Germany and the Soviet Union. This is what the small countries are worried about. The degree and timing of the harm caused by yielding to German pressure and the harm caused by yielding to Allied pressure are very different. Even the most uneducated peasants in the Balkans are well aware of this difference. This is the key to understanding the current situation in the Balkan Peninsula. (Reuters, 18th)

### Belgian Foreign Minister Reaffirms Neutral Policy

Brussels: Foreign Minister Spaak recently attended a joint meeting of labor groups in Verviers and delivered a speech on the various current problems facing Belgium, reaffirming Belgium's neutral policy. He stated, "Since Britain and France have already recognized the inviolability of our country's territory, and Germany has also provided the same guarantee, this is clear evidence that our views have been unanimously recognized by our neighbors. Because of our pursuit of a neutral policy, we have been able to avoid war for the past six months, and we hope that we can continue to do so in the future." In addition, Foreign Minister Spaak elaborated on various domestic issues, such as the issue of food supplies and the mobilization of unemployed workers, as well as the issue of suppressing communist activities. (Havas, 18th)

### Romanian Prime Minister Claims National Stability; Continues to Expand Military Preparations

Bucharest: Prime Minister Tătărescu delivered a radio address to the nation tonight, stating, "Most of the difficulties we have encountered have been overcome, and I believe that we can be more at ease in the future. The reason for this is that the government has worked hard to consolidate its position internationally, but what is especially important is that our army is strong enough to protect our independence and the security of our territory." However, the existing army must continue to be supplemented, and military spending must be increased to achieve perfection. "Although we desire peace, our rights must also be maintained, so we must be prepared and fulfill our highest responsibility to defend our territory." In addition, many members of the fascist Iron Guard have expressed sincerity to the government, and the government's appeasement policy has been remarkably successful, as can be seen from this. (Havas, 17th)

Bucharest: Rumors that a certain country had proposed to Romania to guarantee its borders in exchange for Romania accepting economic or political constraints, or providing compensation, have been firmly denied by Romanian officials. Well-informed sources from Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union also said that they had not heard of it. However, rumors still abound here that Germany and Italy, as well as Germany, the Soviet Union, and Romania, have indeed been in contact on this issue. Certain political figures also said that Prime Minister Tătărescu's radio address yesterday, in which he spoke of the easing of the external and internal situation, was proof that the various rumors were not unfounded. (Havas, 18th)

Bucharest: Representatives of the German, Hungarian, Bulgarian, and Polish minorities in Romania yesterday expressed their loyalty to the Romanian King when debating the response to the King's edict in both houses of parliament. Dr. Roser, representing the German minority, said that they would do their best to assist Romania's military preparations and national defense. (Reuters, 18th)

### German Economic Offensive against Romania

Bucharest: Dr. Clodius, Director of the Economic Division of the German Foreign Ministry, is scheduled to arrive here today. Economic experts believe that this is evidence that Germany is once again launching an economic offensive against Romania. When Germany and Romania signed an economic protocol last December, Clodius assured the Romanian authorities that as long as Romania faithfully fulfilled its commitments, it would not need to fear Germany. However, at this time, no matter what new proposals Germany makes or what new guarantees it attaches, Romania is unlikely to accept them lightly. A few days ago, Romanian Minister of Foreign Trade Cristu announced that he intended to take various measures to encourage the export of oil to those who pay for goods in cash, such as Egypt (Romania purchases a significant amount of cotton from Egypt), Greece, Britain, France, and Italy. Under these measures, Germany may not benefit. (Havas, 18th)

### Romanian Iron Guard Detainees Pardoned

Bucharest: After the fascist Iron Guard expressed its sincerity to the government, the government recently ordered the pardon of 114 members of the group who are currently detained in various locations. (Havas, 17th)

### Internal Disputes in Yugoslavia

Belgrade, Yugoslavia: Rumors of differences of opinion among members of the Yugoslav cabinet on issues such as foreign policy have been denied by well-informed sources here. Government officials here solemnly declare that Yugoslavia's foreign policy is the best guarantee of its security and should continue to be maintained. Only the Serbian opposition is demanding active measures to form a neutral group in Southeast Europe. Other issues on which there are differences of opinion are of a domestic nature, such as the Croatian issue and the issue of the "Peasant Defense Corps." The "Peasant Defense Corps" is a paramilitary organization of the "Croatian Peasant Party." Serbians have expressed their opposition, but Croatians and members of the cabinet have assured the Minister of Defense that the group's mission is to maintain public order and is not of a military nature. (Haitong News Agency, 18th)

### International Organization to Study Peace Terms; British Labour MP Raises Question

London: At a meeting this afternoon, Labour MP Hood Pen asked the Prime Minister whether the government would be prepared to establish a federation of committees from various countries in a suitable neutral location, in order to publicly study all responsible proposals for the terms of a lasting world peace, impartially examine all major economic, territorial, and ethnic issues that have led to war, and determine whether there are principles for the peaceful resolution of international disputes that can be universally accepted. Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler replied that Mr. Hood Pen's ultimate goal certainly met with universal desire, but Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax felt that in the current environment, it was not yet possible to propose practical measures. (Reuters, 18th)

### British Diplomatic Circles Observe International Situation

London – Diplomatic figures have recently commented on the international situation, summarizing the major international events of the past week as follows: (1) The establishment of a peace treaty between Finland and the Soviet Union; (2) US Under Secretary of State Welles' visits to the capitals of England, France, and Italy; (3) The meeting between German leader Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini at the Brenner Pass. Regarding the first point, the successful mediation of the Finnish-Soviet war by neutral countries has raised hopes for mediating the Western European war. However, England and France seem determined to continue fighting, with no possibility of compromise with Germany. As for German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's trip to Rome, it did not yield substantial results, as Germany's attempt to enlist Italy in joint actions in the Balkans may not be welcomed by Italian authorities. Furthermore, Under Secretary Welles is unlikely to adopt an opposing stance toward England and France. (Havas dispatch, 18th)

### German Newspaper Comments on the Czech Issue, Refuting British Foreign Secretary's Remarks

Berlin – The "German Diplomatic-Political Correspondence" stated that British Foreign Secretary Halifax's recent remarks demanding the restoration of Czechoslovakia coincided with the establishment of the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty. England and France had encouraged Finland to resist, but Finland ended a hopeless war, and Poland ventured into war, ultimately leading to its demise. Halifax attempted to encourage other countries to resist Germany, spoke extravagantly about Germany's oppression of the Czech people, and made promises to restore Czech freedom. However, Czech President Hácha believes that the interests of the Czech people are best guaranteed through cooperation with Germany. The Czech people are under the protection of German troops and are confident that Germany will achieve final victory. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 18th)

### French Cabinet Reshuffle Issue, Former Prime Minister Laval May Succeed as Foreign Minister

Paris – According to political observers, it will be revealed no later than tonight whether French Prime Minister Daladier has decided to reshuffle the cabinet. The major debate in the Chamber of Deputies on Tuesday regarding the Finnish situation may be related to the cabinet reshuffle. The Chamber will use the opportunity to discuss the Finnish issue to question the government about the cabinet's composition. Political circles have been discussing the form the cabinet change will take since the end of last week, generally agreeing that forming a wartime cabinet headed by Daladier is highly likely, which would lead to a complete reshuffle of all departments. Some sources anticipate that former Prime Minister Laval may be asked to assume the post of Foreign Minister, while a certain member of the current government will be appointed as France's first Director of Intelligence.

### Trade Difficulties Between England and the United States

Haitong News Agency's airmail communication states that in peacetime, the total value of American goods purchased by the British mainland exceeds the total value of British goods exported to the United States by approximately £80 million annually. If the self-governing territories are included, the trade deficit will increase by another £15 million. However, British territories have a trade surplus of approximately £35 million with the United States annually. Therefore, observing the overall trade balance of the British Empire, the goods purchased from the United States are ultimately more than those sold to it. In peacetime, England already finds it financially difficult to make up for the aforementioned trade deficit. Therefore, shortly before the outbreak of the European war, a British-American trade agreement was drafted as a remedial measure. In recent years, the annual value of American goods imported by England has been £100 million. During the last year or two of World War I, due to the war, the total value of American goods imported by England reached £300 million annually. Now that the price of the British pound has decreased, the prices of military supplies have soared, and England again needs to purchase military supplies from the United States, will the financial difficulties encountered in the future not be even greater? Moreover, the United States has recently added "cash and carry" provisions, making things even more difficult for England. The British government certainly wants to increase the quantity of goods sold to the United States. Although there is a possibility of increasing the purchase of rubber and tin produced by British territories, the value of the goods increased annually will ultimately not exceed £15 million, which cannot make up for the losses. England has also considered measures to restrict the import of non-essential goods. Except for military supplies, which are urgently needed and difficult to restrict, England has already ordered a large quantity of Egyptian cotton, accounting for the majority of its production. England is also obligated to purchase a considerable quantity of tobacco produced in Turkey. From this, it can be seen that there are obstacles to England's desire to restrict the quantity of imported non-essential goods. Currently, it can be predicted that England will likely stop purchasing American-made cars and will try its best to purchase food produced by the self-governing territories to replace American goods, but the effect of this method will ultimately be limited. Another strategy is to increase the export of gold. The British Empire produces gold worth approximately £100 million annually. Recently, a large amount of gold has been imported into the United States. To alleviate England's trade deficit with the United States, it is necessary to further increase the export of gold to make up for it. However, there is no certainty as to how much the increase will be. In short, after overall planning, the question of how England will raise funds to pay for goods imported from the United States has not only not been resolved, but also feels extremely thorny. The British government certainly does not want to see various unfavorable reactions occur in the British Empire's markets and in the South American markets, but if the war is prolonged, these reactions may be unavoidable.

### National Government Actively Develops Resources, Establishes New Economic Foundation, Unleashes Enormous Capacity, Abundant Finances, Budget Increases Little, Stable Currency Value, Gold Travels in Chongqing, Returns to Shanghai, Discusses Impressions

Gold, the editor of the English-language "China Press," recently traveled to Chongqing and wrote an impression piece, published in the newspaper. A common question in people's minds is how long China and Japan can sustain their efforts. At the beginning of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937, knowledgeable experts predicted that this war of attrition would last for one or at most two years, and both countries would inevitably collapse. As for which side would collapse first, it depended on one's sympathies and point of view. Today, after a long period of testing, Japan has clearly shown signs of being under heavy pressure and has begun to show cracks, but it is still able to continue fighting. As for free China, it has a vast and fertile hinterland, and its potential is surprisingly great. Merchants from the coastal ports and the wealthy people who previously resided in Nanjing, along with knowledgeable Chinese people, are deeply patriotic and have come to Chongqing. They have discovered that the wartime capital is developing in many ways and is intensifying its efforts to continue the war. The situation is expected to continue to improve, and there is no dissent, whether privately or publicly, regarding the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction.

Finances are Sound and Not Threatened by Scarcity

The government's finances have not collapsed. It is true that the exchange rate of the legal currency has tightened and prices have risen, but these are not signs of currency or financial collapse. Vice Minister of Finance Xu Kan stated, "Our plan is for a long-term War of Resistance. China is an agricultural country with abundant food, clothing, and daily necessities. Our country has a vast land and enormous human and financial resources. The three key points of wartime finance are (1) increasing production. The budget for agricultural credit loans has been greatly increased this year;

Developing Resources, Prospering the Market

(2) Developing natural resources, especially minerals. Free China has far more natural resources than the occupied areas; (3) Rapidly developing light industry. Today, banks are established in the remote west to build the foundation for economic activity, with the aim of expanding production facilities to increase domestic products. Now, thirty-two months into the war, there is no concern about shortages of food and other necessities. European countries must immediately implement a rationing system when they encounter war. Our people continue to operate their businesses, which are very prosperous, as if there were no war. This is not superficial prosperity, but prosperity based on unleashing enormous capacity. With this as a basic principle, we can fight indefinitely. Our country maintains sufficient reserves while striving to prevent inflation and engaging in economic development.

Special Efforts to Develop the Economy

Our policy is to place government finances on a commercial basis. The money spent on agricultural projects will be doubled." The Chinese government is now making special efforts to promote development according to local needs, and each war zone has a special economic committee to combat the monopolistic activities of the Japanese in their semi-occupied areas. According to a government spokesperson, the guerrillas have been very successful in preventing the Japanese from forcibly seizing agricultural products from farmers. It is reported that in Sichuan alone, the government's four major banks are preparing to allocate 100 million yuan for agricultural credit loans.

Budget Significantly Lower Than Japan's

China's current budget is about three times that of 1934, but government officials claim that the budget should be based on 1937, when the war broke out, and today's budget has increased little compared to 1937. As for military spending, the claim that it accounts for three-quarters of the total budget has been denied by the Ministry of Finance. According to Minister Kong, Japan's debts and expenses are far greater than China's, and China's budget is insignificant compared to those of countries like England and France. Furthermore, China's currency is fundamentally sound. As for China's income, although customs duties, salt taxes, and consolidated taxes have all been greatly reduced, the losses have been offset by income tax and excess profits tax. The purchase of foreign goods is less than before, but many necessities are still obtained through foreign loans and barter trade.

### All Circles Commemorate the March 18th Massacre Yesterday, National Spirit Was Even More Vigorous After the Beijing Tragedy

Yesterday was the anniversary of the March 18th Massacre, and all circles mourned deeply. At that time in 1926, the National Revolutionary Army and the Fengtian Army were at war, and the National Revolutionary Army blockaded the Dagukou, which led to diplomatic negotiations. On March 18th, the people of Beijing, motivated by righteous indignation, petitioned the State Council but were not accepted. Furthermore, they were shot at, resulting in the deaths of more than 20 petitioners and students. Since the occurrence of this tragedy, the national spirit has become even more vigorous, and people's awareness of national affairs has gradually awakened.

### All Trade Unions Support National Policy, Ministry Sends Telegram to Express Condolences and Encouragement, Hoping for Continued Efforts, Striving for Final Victory

Chongqing, 18th – The Central Department of Social Affairs recently sent a telegram to more than 100 trade unions, including the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union, denying their support for "peace," and sent a special telegram to Shanghai to express condolences and encouragement. The original telegram stated, "(Title omitted) Your associations have jointly sent a telegram, solemnly denying the so-called 'peace' proposal, firmly expressing support for the Commander-in-Chief and the national policy of resistance. This shows that although our workers are temporarily isolated and subject to oppression, their awareness of resistance has not wavered, and their patriotic enthusiasm has only increased. This is commendable. It is hoped that you will continue your efforts and strive for final victory. Central Department of Social Affairs."

### Elder Mr. Qin Yanqi's Funeral Held Yesterday, Public Organizations Discuss Commemoration

Mr. Qin Yanqi, the general director of the Shanghai Charity Association, unfortunately passed away from illness the day before yesterday (the 16th). He was a Jinshi from the late Qing Dynasty, and his writing and morality were comparable to those of Lu Ling. He once held office in Hubei, earning a reputation for his political achievements. After the founding of the Republic, he served as a member of the Jiangsu Provincial Assembly, making proposals and abolishing evils, benefiting his hometown. He participated in compiling the Shanghai County Annals and editing the posthumous works of famous figures, drawing on a wide range of sources and demonstrating extraordinary precision. He was diligent in his writing and continued to be so in his old age. After the August 13th Incident, he continued to serve as a director of various charitable organizations, planning meticulously and remaining unblemished. This year, he was 80 years old and happily revisited Pan Shui. He composed a poem to record his feelings, and many people wrote in response. His old friends planned to offer him a cup of wine to celebrate his birthday, but unexpectedly, the news of his death spread, causing grief and regret to those who heard it. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the funeral was held at the Shanghai Funeral Home. More than 1,000 people attended, including Chen Taoyi, Shen Xinqing, Huang Hanzhi, Wen Lanting, Xi Yushu, Li Guiyong, Yan Shuhe, Jin Jushan, Mao Zijian, Yan Weilian, Zhou Jinghan, Zhu Yinjiang, Pei Yunqing, Ma Jiliang, Su Zugui, Yao Lizhi, and Qu Shaoqi. Organizations included the Pudong Fellow Villagers Association, the Shanghai Charity Association Federation, the Shanghai County Local Property Office, the Relief Association for Women and Children, the Yimiao Board of Directors, the Xin Pu Yu Tang, the Disabled Persons' Home, the Hu Nan Charity Association, the Pu Yi Vocational Training Institute, the Bao An Nursing Home, the Xin Pudong Newspaper, the Chinese Vocational Education Society, and more than 30 other organizations. Schools included Dajiang, Minli, Songhu, Sisheng, Xiang Yao, Sanlin, Zhonghua Vocational, Jisheng, and other primary and secondary schools, all of which sent representatives to pay their respects solemnly. Carriages and horses were crowded, and condolence banners were displayed everywhere, showing the utmost grief and honor. His son, Zhizhi Quanjiu, is also young and talented, able to read his father's books and carry on his legacy. It is also heard that various public organizations, remembering his hard work, plan to privately honor him with the posthumous title "Jing Hui Gong" to express their admiration. Therefore, a meeting will be convened soon to plan the ceremony and express their condolences together.

### Shanghai-Wenzhou Ships Open to Passengers, Large Numbers of Passengers Travel There, Please Facilitate Entry at the Shipping Administration Office

Regarding the issue of passengers on Shanghai-Wenzhou ships, after the Wenzhou Fellow Villagers Association sent a letter to various shipping companies requesting them to purchase more tickets, the shipping companies believe that as long as passengers do not travel in stages, they should be allowed to board as much as possible. It is reported that in addition to deciding to strictly handle fellow villagers returning to their hometowns, the association has also sent a letter to the Wenzhou-Taiwan Shipping Administration Office, stating that for fellow villagers returning to their hometowns who have a genuine guarantee from the Fellow Villagers Association, they should be facilitated for entry to benefit commerce, transportation, and navigation. It has also been learned that recently, many fellow villagers from Wenzhou have requested the Fellow Villagers Association to provide guarantees for returning to their hometowns. The British ship "Xin An Tong" departed from Shanghai for Wenzhou yesterday afternoon, with a large number of passengers on board, marking the beginning of the opening of Shanghai-Wenzhou ships to passengers.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Discusses Continuing to Sell Flour at Reduced Prices, Original Reduced Price Period Ends Tomorrow, Reduced Price for Next Period Not Yet Agreed Upon

After the price of flour in the city rose, the Shanghai Municipal Council, in order to suppress the price and relieve the people's food difficulties, previously consulted with the Fufeng and Fuxin flour mills. From February 19th to March 19th, for a total of 30 days, they supplied 7,500 bags of flour at reduced prices every day, which were sold at reduced prices by 27 flour shops in the two concessions to regulate the market. During this month, a total of 225,000 bags of flour were sold at reduced prices, resulting in significant losses for the factories. The Chairman of the Council, Mr. Fackeley, has sent a special letter to the two factories to express his gratitude. However, it is heard that regarding the continuation of reduced prices, the price of imported wheat, the raw material, has recently risen sharply. The Municipal Council, in order to take into account both the factory's costs and the suppression of the selling price, has been actively consulting with the two factories mentioned above on the reduced price for the next period. The process has been underway for nearly a week and has not yet been finalized. Negotiations are still ongoing, and an announcement will be made once the price is agreed upon, so that regulation can continue. The Noodle Industry Association has notified all stores that after March 19th, they should continue to operate as usual. If they have to purchase recycled flour, they may increase the price appropriately due to cost considerations to meet retail sales.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Tries to Reduce Food for Prison Inmates, Starting with Reducing Rice Rations, Trial Period Set for Three Months

Amidst the opposition to increasing the municipal tax, the Shanghai Municipal Council suddenly issued a public notice yesterday, stating that it has been decided to find ways to conserve food for prisoners in the Ward Road Jail from mid-March onwards in order to reduce the Municipal Council's expenditures for this year. The Ward Road Jail has a wide range and holds more than 8,500 people (mostly Chinese). The Chinese government has never borne any of their expenses. At a time when rice is expensive, the Municipal Council, seeing that the expenses of the Ward Road Jail are increasing daily and that the increase in taxes is opposed by all parties, generally believes that this move by the Municipal Council is the first step in responding to the opposition to raising taxes.

Preliminary Investigation

The Municipal Council's expenditure on food for prison inmates was originally set at 79,000 yuan per month in the preliminary budget for this year, but in reality, since January of this year, this expenditure has increased to 135,000 yuan per month. Even if food prices do not rise again in the future, the total expenditure on prisoner food for the entire year is estimated to reach 1.6 million yuan, exceeding the preliminary budget by 600,000 yuan and increasing by about 1.17 million yuan compared to the previous year. In view of this, the Council organized a special committee, together with representatives from various departments and experts from the Health Department, to conduct an investigation into food for prisoners. The committee members are McDonald, Xu Xiaochu, Li Wenjie, and Xu Naili.

Current Measures

In the past, suggestions for reducing food for prisoners have been repeatedly opposed, on the grounds that reducing food would increase the morbidity and mortality rates of prisoners. The current table of dietary quantities for prisoners was previously compiled by the Health Department using scientific methods and is very precise. At the same time, attention has been paid to the nutrients contained in the diet. The diet for prisoners is currently divided into three types: high, medium, and low, depending on whether the prisoner is working, whether they have been diagnosed by a doctor, and whether they are being punished. In addition, prisoners suffering from tuberculosis and other diseases are given special diets. The committee has also paid attention to the morbidity and mortality rates of prisoners.

Reducing Rice Rations

According to the committee's statement, its main purpose is to adjust both the needs of prison food and the necessary savings in the bureau's expenses for the sake of taxpayers' interests. In the past, all purchases of prison food were made through public bidding, and the lowest bids were selected. Therefore, it is believed that there is no waste in the food for prisoners. At present, the rice supplied to prisoners is inexpensive brown rice. The committee has carefully reviewed all the ingredients of prison food and considered whether they can be reduced. As a result, it has suggested to the Council that the rice ration in prison food should be reduced as a trial. The trial period is set for one month. The above suggestion has been adopted by the Council.

### Japanese Side to Revise the Nine-Power Treaty

A spokesperson for the Japanese Consulate declared yesterday at a reception for journalists that the Nine-Power Treaty, like clothes from the past, is no longer applicable to the present and should be discarded. When asked when the Japanese side would announce the abolition of the treaty, the spokesperson said that in fact, it is necessary to revise this treaty significantly. The spokesperson continued that, from a legal point of view, Japan does not seem to need to fully comply with the various principles stipulated in the Nine-Power Treaty. When asked whether this measure would affect the rights and interests of Americans in China, the spokesperson replied that the principle of Japan's policy is to try its best to avoid conflicts with the rights and interests of third countries in China.

### The Third Round of Government Rice Sales to Begin Today; Scheduled to End Temporarily on April 7th; Rice Prices Continue to Decline in the Market Yesterday Morning

The third round of government rice sales will begin today. All procedures will be the same as in the first and second rounds, and it is scheduled to end temporarily on April 7th (end of the second month of the lunar calendar). The police departments of the two concessions have issued announcements at the various sales locations, requiring all civilians purchasing rice to maintain order and follow the instructions of the police officers to avoid accidents. The Rice Dealers Association sent a letter to the Shanghai Stabilization Committee yesterday, reporting that the locations of the three sale points have been

Confirmed and updated.

Therefore, the order during this round of sales is expected to be even more organized. Yesterday morning, after the market opened at 9 a.m., market sentiment continued to be bearish, and prices fell again. Saigon and other types of rice had dropped to 39 yuan, and other types of rice also continued to decline. A member of the Rice Industry Committee stated that the reasons for the recent decline in rice prices were

Due to the reasons for the price decline

Nothing more than an oversupply and slow sales. There were more sellers than buyers in the market, and due to tight credit conditions, large dealers were selling off large quantities of imported rice. Furthermore, warehouses were full to capacity, and storage fees were increasing. At the same time, buyers, seeing rice prices falling, adopted a wait-and-see attitude and were unwilling to continue purchasing, resulting in supply exceeding demand. Spot goods were readily available. Moreover, market firms were required to use cash notes. Therefore,

Illegal activities were suspected.

Furthermore, the Bean and Rice Industry Association previously received a letter from Xing Zhigang, a standing committee member of the association, stating that robberies were rampant in the cargo docks, disrupting business. He requested that a letter be sent to the Municipal Council for serious action. The association has now forwarded the letter to the authorities for approval and implementation.

They also confessed that three box guns and two pistols were hidden at the home of their fellow villager Gu Congyin at No. 3 Fenjin Lane, Xiahfei Road. The detectives went to the address, but the weapons had already been taken away by the fugitive Zhu and Li upon hearing the news. Only Gu Congyin was arrested.

### Expanding Tuberculosis Prevention Campaign; Radio Broadcast Today; Held at the Xindu Radio Station

The tuberculosis prevention campaign, jointly launched by leaders from all sectors of the city, began on the 15th of this month at the Hongqiao Sanatorium on Xiahfei Road. Since the launch of large-scale tuberculosis screenings, people from all walks of life have enthusiastically gone for X-ray examinations. In recent days, approximately one-third of those examined have been found to have lung disease, meaning one in three people have tuberculosis. This shows the rampant nature of tuberculosis in the current isolated island situation. The association provides free photography for those found to have lung disease to ensure speedy diagnosis and treatment, early recovery, reduced transmission, and benefit society. The association is now expanding the campaign, and will be hosting a radio broadcast at the New Capital Radio Station of the New New Company, starting at 2:00 p.m. today.

It is sure to be a feast for the ears of the people of Shanghai.

### Another Ferry Capsizes in the Huangpu River Yesterday; Approximately Six or Seven Passengers Missing

The so-called "Dadong City Ferry" has recently been involved in continuous accidents. On the evening of the 15th, the Shanghai-character No. 10 ferry was sunk by the Japanese ship Taigu Maru at the Pudong Lujiazui area, drowning eight Chinese and Japanese people. Yesterday, at about 10 a.m., the Shanghai-character No. 6 ferry, operating between the Pudong Nanmatou and the Nanshi Nanmatou, was towing two barges loaded with passengers across the river. When it reached the middle of the river, one of the barges was hit by waves and was being towed too quickly, suddenly capsizing. Fifty to sixty passengers fell into the water at the same time. Rescue efforts were immediately launched, and forty to fifty people were rescued on the spot. It is estimated that at least six or seven people drowned, but the exact number has not yet been determined. The whereabouts of the dead are unknown, making the recovery difficult. The captain of the ferry was arrested by the so-called "Water Patrol Team" afterwards.

### Bandits Apprehended in Two Hotels

The Old Gate Police Station recently learned that a gang of bandits was hiding in Room 508 of the Yu Qiaqing Hotel on Mainland Avenue. On the day before yesterday, Chinese detectives Yang Guanying, He Xiaozhi, and detectives Xu Fusheng, Zhou Wenqing, Qin Boliang, and Chen Ruisheng rushed to arrest them. They arrested Gao Peilin from Hunan, Li Changchun from Suzhou, and Zhu Fang from Suzhou (also known as Lao Ba, a famous prostitute from the Xiaojinhua brothel at No. 97 Shantou Road) in the room. Gao and Zhu were embracing in bed. They were all taken to the police station. After Gao confessed, they arrested Wang Xiaomao from Ningbo (owner of the Jinhua Guide Agency at No. 250 Yunnan Road), Xu Maotang, Zhang Baofa from Nanjing, Wei Donggen from Pudong, Zhang Jusheng from Tianjin, Li Zhenhuan from Hankou, Fang Caigen from Jiangyin, Deng Amao from Suzhou, Cai Zengfu from Shanghai, Zhu Fusheng, and a woman named Li Gu, a total of eleven people, at Room 437 of the Shenzhou Hotel on Zhejiang Road.

Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The police station's lawyer, Ru Bao Yi, requested permission to detain them because further investigation of other cases was needed. After Judge Xiao Xiefen reviewed the report, he ordered that they be detained for further questioning at a later date.

### West Shanghai Pseudo-Market Reportedly Opening; No Local Merchants Participating

The so-called "Central Vegetable Market" was originally scheduled to open at the beginning of the month, but the date was temporarily changed. Therefore, it is still in a state of suspension. The "West Shanghai Vegetable Market," a branch located at the corner of Bailinan Road and Zhongshan Road in West Shanghai, has completed the construction of its three-story market building, and is reportedly scheduled to officially open on the 25th of this month. The market management will be handled by a "committee" that elected "Chairman" Zhang Longhai (owner of Zhang Yitai Local Produce Company), "Committee Members" Zhang Zhaokui (of Tongxing Company), Xue Xiaodi (of Yuxing Company), and Xu Jianqiu (of Longtai Company). In the future, if local goods companies want to join the "market" to do business, they will be divided into "three levels": "Grade A" requires a capital contribution of 800 yuan, "Grade B" 400 yuan, and "Grade C" 200 yuan. Yesterday morning at 10 a.m., the entire "market" committee held an inaugural meeting at the Yijia Chun Restaurant in the Caojiadu Triangular Market. However, most local goods companies and vegetable vendors in West Shanghai have an opposing attitude towards the "vegetable market" which has the nature of control, so few have joined to date. The talk of opening on schedule is feared to remain just a dream. (Hua Guang News Agency)

According to a Datong News Agency reporter's inquiry to the Shanghai Postal Administration, regarding the rumor that domestic postal rates will increase starting April 1, although the bureau has not yet received an order from the Kunming Postal Ministry, news from postal bureaus in the Northwest confirms that this is indeed the case.

### Police Departments of Both Concessions Deny Advocating Peace

The English-language Da Mei Evening News stated that senior Chinese officials of the Municipal Council and Police Department of the Public Concession and the Municipal Council and Police Department of the French Concession unanimously denied yesterday morning that they had declared support for the "Peace Movement" and refuted the news as completely "made out of nothing."

Furthermore, they firmly believe that all Chinese officials would definitely not agree with the so-called "Peace Movement." Chinese officials from the Police Department said that if they had supported the "Peace Movement," the Police Department would definitely know about it, but they have not heard of such action, which proves that it is completely a "rumor."

### Finland Holds World Games Problem Finnish Committee Discusses at the End of the Month International Conference Decides in May

(Paris, 17th, Havas) The Paris Evening Post correspondent in the Netherlands recently wired that the Finnish Olympic Committee recently held a meeting in the capital of the country to discuss the question of whether the Olympic Movement Games this year should be held. After a long period of debate, the majority of the committee members believed that it should still be held as scheduled. Although several countries are currently at war and transportation is difficult, Finland can take this opportunity to attract tourists from neutral countries to assist in the country's reconstruction. This opportunity should not be ignored. However, the duration of the meeting can be reduced from two weeks to one week, and several competition programs, especially yachting, rowing, and equestrian competitions, will be cancelled. It is hoped that at least fifteen countries, including the United States, Italy, and Japan, will participate in the competition, so that the grand occasion of the conference can still be maintained. The Finnish Olympic Committee is scheduled to continue discussing this matter at the end of this month, but the final decision will be made by the International Olympic Committee at its meeting in May this year.

### Grain Early Rice Has Been Opened at the Limit Price Saigon Fell into the 40 Yuan Mark Reason Arrival Stockpiling Is Congested, Silver Is Tight, And Warehouse Rent Is Increased, It Is Not Good to Hoard

Yesterday, the rice market continued to plummet, which was more severe than before. The prices of various foreign rice continued to plummet by as much as two yuan. If the number one Saigon has fallen into the 40 yuan mark, the seller is 39 yuan, and the white early rice that has long disappeared in the market also has a pond market Su Geng that has opened a stream according to the limit of 40 yuan, which is like a spring thunder that bursts out and is deeply shocking. The reason why the rice price has been falling all the way is that the arrival is prosperous and the sales are sluggish. The Shanghai warehouse storage is abundant, and a large number of foreign rice is still pouring in continuously. The silver required is heavy. To facilitate the turnover, there is only a quick release. Naizuoke's aspect was initially still trying to take advantage of the cheap activity, but after day after day, it was all a loss, and they were surprised to be wary and shrink back. As a result, the more it fell, the more dull it became, the more dull it became, and the wind of falling day by day, at a time when it fell sharply, although the general merchants in the early market intended to persist to the end, the scattered households were afraid and fell again and again, until the end of the midday market, the prices of various foreign rice continued to fall by about two yuan, and the transaction volume in the whole market was even rarer than before, only about three or four thousand bags, and Erhaixiang and Xiaozhe original packages were reduced to forty-four and a half yuan, and there was still a lack of big households asking. Although the overseas pricing does not require it, there are a large number of deposits and continuous arrivals, and Willy Han Company has increased the Jinliyuan warehouse rent to 94 cents, in order to promote customers to pick up goods. Therefore, all the hoarders are eager to sell, which is also one of the reasons for the sharp drop in foreign rice.

The price of glutinous rice has always been low, although it has not fallen as sharply as foreign rice. It is estimated that yesterday it fell to one yuan. The state rice such as thick and thin glutinous rice, although the pond market su rice was seen on the market, there has been a limited number of streams opened, but the high-priced goods are still silent, and the private estimates in the outer market are also extraordinarily bleak, and the market is also declining step by step by one yuan.

Another 4,540 bags of foreign sugar arrived, which were shipped from Haiphong on the Taisheng ship of the Yihai Foreign Company and arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday (17th). It was completely unloaded yesterday.

It is also said that the amount registered by borrowers with the Shenxin Factory is only over 300 bales. Bullish traders believe that inventory is not high and sales are good, further strengthening their bullish view on Double Horse yarn. Therefore, the yarn market is currently showing a difficult situation of both advancing and retreating.

The spot yarn market opened with strong sentiment as Chaozhou suddenly bought spot Double Horse yarn, causing the market to rise to $974. However, with the exchange rate strengthening, the market had the potential to weaken. Support from actual sales provided temporary support.

### Rehashed Old News: 67 Years Ago (428) (See This Newspaper from the 12th Year of the Tongzhi Reign of the Late Qing Dynasty)

Misfortune and Fortune Intertwined

Among the myriad things that fill the world, everything is unequal. What is created will be destroyed, what gathers will scatter. Even the purest and noblest things, such as calligraphy, paintings, and literary artifacts, once treasured and accumulated excessively, are begrudged by the Creator. In ancient times, the Tang Dynasty collected calligraphy and paintings, filling secret archives. Taking Wang Xizhi's works as an example, it is said that there were over 5,000 pieces, all bearing the Zhenguan authentication seal, with jade axes and ivory labels, representing the height of the era. However, within a few centuries, Huang Chao's rebellion reduced everything to ashes. In more recent times, Grand Secretary Ruan Yuan collected ancient and modern books, surpassing all others in the southeast. Yet, within a few decades, they were consumed by fire. If books and rubbings are destroyed by excessive accumulation, how much more so are gold, silver, and wealth? Therefore, Qian Qianyi said, "National treasures should circulate." The meaning is clear and understandable. But fools do not see this, wasting their entire lives seeking constant accumulation without circulation, accumulating without exchange, relying on abacuses to calculate tirelessly. The more they calculate, the more enjoyable it becomes, until they calculate that no one in the world can match them. Then, the great abacus of Heaven appears. Tracing back to the founding of the Ming Dynasty in Nanjing, Emperor Taizu was besieged in the north by Chen Youliang and in the south by Zhang Shicheng, holding only a small territory with insufficient supplies. A man from Anhui deeply understood the secret of marketable goods,竭尽输将. Emperor Taizu deeply appreciated this. Later, Emperor Taizu unified the country and rewarded功行赏. The man from Anhui declined, saying, "We are all merchants and should not serve as officials." Therefore, Emperor Taizu granted the salt monopoly to Anhui. Thus, from the current dynasty to the provinces that respond to rural lifting, only Anhui merchants have commercial status. For a time, the people of Anhui accumulated wealth daily, and almost all the wealth of the world was calculated. The merchants returned to their hometown every three years, happily performing operas to thank the gods in the Yellow Mountains, imitating the ancient village wine ceremony, called the Yellow Mountain Meeting, seated in order of wealth. Those with more gold sat in the first seat.

Psychology

### Education by Intimidation

— Yan Quan

A person in a normal state must have a normal psychology. To cultivate a normal psychology, it must begin with childhood. In modern times, with the continuous evolution of education, school education is gradually focusing on child psychology. Many progressive educators in Europe and the United States have shifted their attention to child education, and are actively promoting the education of children under six years old. Because the first six years of childhood is a period of rapid growth, and all of a person's habits, psychology, and actions are formed during this period. According to the results of psychological experiments, once habits are formed, it is more difficult to change them. Especially in adulthood, changing habits becomes extremely difficult. Therefore, the education of young children is particularly worthy of attention.

China's early childhood education is still in its infancy, and the care of young children mostly rests with mothers. The traditional methods of Chinese mothers to teach children are nothing more than deception or intimidation. For example, when a mother sees a child leaving food in his bowl, she deceives him with superstitions:

"The thunder god is going to strike. Someone used to be like you, and he was struck dead by the heavens." If a child cries at night, she will say, "Ghosts are coming, wild cats are coming." This causes the child to be stained with a layer of superstition in gods and ghosts and fear of dark animals or hatred of animals. Some mothers are even worse. They intimidate children in the dark, often saying, "The red-headed Indian is coming, foreigners are coming, or even someone from a certain country." In this way, a shadow of racial inferiority is cast on the weak mind of the child, or it can deepen racial hatred. I used to have a neighbor mistress who loved her son very much. After her son fell, she often transferred her anger to the maids, and sometimes even kicked the tables and chairs, which had fallen by themselves. She would always hit the tables and chairs to vent her son's anger. Although it could temporarily divert the child's attention or cause him to smile, it invisibly cultivated the child's habit of hitting tables, throwing bowls, kicking doors, and hitting walls, which would burden the mother instead. Also, if a child is subjected to excessive intimidation, it can not only make his ideas incorrect, but also manifest in dreams at night, and even lead to psychological disorders. Conversely, if a child is excessively spoiled by his family, he is also being deceived in an invisible way. If he is separated from his mother, he will feel the pain of not being able to adapt to the environment, especially towards group life, and will have various negative feelings. The general mistresses in Shanghai tell servants to lead the children, usually saying "deceive the children." It seems that adults do not need to have a sincere psychology towards young children, as long as the children do not cry or make noise, then they are the best nannies.

Deception and intimidation give children many incorrect knowledge and incorrect ideas and psychology. We should not scold children for having bad tempers, nor should we hate children for being stupid. Every parent should reflect on themselves, how much deception and intimidation have you given to these small lives?

We see that in this era, many seasoned adults can still be psychologically disordered by small threats and inducements. Then, the weak minds of children should not be educated by "deception" and "intimidation."

We protest against the general adults implementing intimidation on children!

Random Thoughts

### Word Count

— Competition

Writing articles and being concerned about the word count is usually something for those who write for a living, except when it comes to meeting certain exam requirements or regulations like "requires above a certain number of words" or "limited to a certain number of words."

Since newspapers and magazines started soliciting articles and established payment standards such as "a certain amount of money per thousand words," many people have been practicing their 'stretching skills'. They deliberately stretch an opinion that could be expressed in three hundred words to five hundred or eight hundred words, simply because they cannot earn more if they don't. As a result, one often sees articles that are simple in content but extraordinarily long, articles that are thousands of words long but empty of substance.

I once heard a 'writer's' grand pronouncement: 'Writing novels is better than writing essays.' Immediately, I humbly said, 'I would like to hear the reasoning.' He then cited the first 'advantage' of writing novels, which is that it is easier to stretch the word count. Essays, on the other hand, require some 'inspiration' to flow smoothly, making them difficult to write long.

Writing articles and paying attention to length, for the sake of a little compensation, resorting to forced stretching, turning a good, concise piece of writing into something where 'the dragon shows its head but not its tail'. A group of 'nearsighted' readers then praise it, saying, "Good article, look, it's written so long!" In this way, it is difficult to obtain truly excellent articles!

I would like to offer the eight words "speak long if you have something to say, speak short if you have nothing to say" to the writers of articles today!

### Hitler's British Girlfriend

— Chen Shichao

In January of this year, newspapers published a piece of news saying that Hitler's British girlfriend, Miss Mitford, was injured by a gunshot and was carried home on a stretcher. This Nordic woman, considered ideal by Hitler, is the daughter of a British aristocrat, and since 1938, her name has frequently appeared in the headlines of newspapers.

From September to December 1939, her activities were extremely mysterious. At that time, she was in Germany. It wasn't until January of this year that newspapers reported that she was shot and carried back to London on a stretcher.

This aristocratic woman is twenty-five years old, tall, with golden hair and beautiful appearance. When Britain declared war on Germany on September 3 last year, she was trapped in Germany due to the disruption of transportation and could not leave the country. On October 20, a message came out saying that she was ill in a hospital in Munich and needed to undergo surgery. However, there was no detailed report on what illness she was suffering from.

Miss Mitford has been at the center of political storms for two years. However, her initial encounter with Hitler was long before this wave. It is said that one night in 1934, Hitler was dining in a restaurant in Munich when he saw Miss Mitford sitting at a table nearby.

Hitler asked one of his adjutants, "Who is this perfect Nordic woman?" The adjutant replied that she was British. Hitler immediately ordered that she be invited to join him, and from that moment on, Miss Mitford became an admirer of Hitler. Conversely, she also became one of the few girlfriends appreciated by Hitler.

Her support for Hitler and purism has encountered many reactions. In June 1938, she was arrested by the Czech authorities in Karlsbad on suspicion of espionage. Shortly before this incident, she had announced her intention to become a German citizen, which was probably the reason why she was not welcomed in Czechoslovakia. However, she was only detained for one day before being released.

On another occasion, in April 1938, she also suffered because of her support for Nazism. At that time, a mass rally in support of the Spanish Republican government was held in Hyde Park in London. Miss Mitford was wearing a swastika armband and was beaten by the protesting crowd. She was later rescued by the police and escaped danger.

Miss Mitford was born in 1914. Her father is the second Baron Redesdale and has six daughters in total. She is the fourth, and her name is Unity. One of her sisters is the wife of Sir Mosley, the leader of the British Fascist Party.

### Not Afraid of Criticism

— Shi Ye

No one can avoid being criticized.

But some people are born with a 'thin skin' and are afraid of people's criticism. When criticized, pointed out, or scolded, they blush and become flustered; when they occasionally hear ugly remarks or attacks behind their backs, they become restless and feel ashamed to face others, even developing suicidal thoughts.

In fact, there is no need to be afraid of people's criticism. Criticism can be well-intentioned or malicious. We should humbly accept well-intentioned criticism and ignore malicious criticism. According to my daily experience, criticism behind people's backs is not well-intentioned, and it is even rumors, slanders, and smears. The meanness of such people's character can be imagined. Criticism behind people's backs is commonly called "speaking ill of someone," so the person who is most likely to speak ill of others must be a "bad person." Why be afraid of "bad people's" criticism?

We should adopt a correct attitude towards people's criticism. Whether it is advice, pointing out, attack, rumor, or smear, we should gather it all, objectively examine it, and then carefully conduct "self-criticism," thoroughly examining whether there are any errors or faults in all our words and deeds. If there are, we should admit them frankly and strive to correct and overcome them; if there are none, then there is no need to worry and remain calm. If the other party's criticism is malicious, then give a stern reply. If we can do this, we will not only not be afraid of people's criticism, but on the contrary, we will welcome it.

### Children's Group Marriage

— Hai Feng

Recently, a group marriage was held in the northern Katiawar village of the Mumbai region of India. A total of 374 pairs of infants participated, making it the largest children's marriage ceremony in recent years. Many of the newlyweds were too young to walk and were brought by their parents, who arranged everything. The babies lay comfortably in their arms, giggling when they heard the cannon fire. Many of the grooms came in elaborately decorated bullock carts, and when they were brought before the monks, some were laughing and some were crying. Most of them had no idea what was going on. During the ceremony, the monks recited vows. After the ceremony, there was a joint banquet, and the parents also participated. The newlyweds ate very little, some running around, some snatching food, some playing, and the smallest were asleep. Due to the caste system and arranged marriages, child marriages are still practiced. In recent years, although the government has tried to prohibit it, it has not been very effective. A law was promulgated in 1935 stipulating the minimum marriage age as fourteen; a similar law was also enacted in 1934, stipulating the minimum age as thirteen. These laws are difficult to enforce because all classes in India have always permitted child marriages. According to a survey in 1921, there were 250,000 wives and widows in India under the age of five, and two million under the age of ten. It is estimated that about 40% of Indian women marry between the ages of ten and fifteen.

### Suggestions on National Films

— Bao Fuxing

In recent years, perhaps because of the environment in Shanghai, most domestic films have gone down the path of "historical dramas," which was never considered before. Especially in the past year or two, "historical dramas" have simply dominated the world! In terms of historical dramas, almost all of them revolve around "women," which is certainly not right.

Moreover, even if the current and past historical dramas are carefully produced, they cannot eliminate their inherent shortcomings, because we are in daily contact with modern materials and modern spirit. Once we run into the cinema, our eyes are full of "antique charm." How can this be the "proper way"?

Therefore, from now on, in any case, we cannot let historical dramas dominate. In my personal opinion, the production of historical dramas should be relegated to a supporting role, and the main goal should be "modern films" with modern spirit and modern significance—or "era films" with the spirit and significance of the times. Everyone knows the difficulties of the environment, but "it is up to people to make things happen." The most important thing is willingness to work hard! Besides, it is much easier than historical dramas in terms of clothing, props, scenery, and scripts! For example, in "modern films," Guohua's "Seven Heavens" is very satisfactory.

At this time of soaring prices, the materials for "modern films" are even more "easy to pick up"; rice weevils, coal weevils, frozen ghosts, starving ghosts, the rampant of thieves, the increase in suicides, and even a part of the "bosses" in the education field, etc., should also be attacked and corrected! All of this is excellent material for drama! Moreover, the scope of film art is extremely broad. Literary films, science films, and social films can all be produced and are both popular and meaningful. Why not "shoot" them?

Therefore, I hope that the authorities of various domestic film companies can consider the actual situation, make improvements to the production policy, and make greater efforts to make domestic films more popular with the Chinese people!

### Wireless Movies Shown in Airplanes

— Qing Hui

The American Paramount Company recently opened wireless movies in postal airplanes over Florida, and the results of the experiment were considered satisfactory. The machine used in this test is a Lowe brand standard projector, and all parts have been washed with chemicals to make them non-flammable to prevent accidents. The width of the screen is only six inches, suspended behind the pilot's office, occupying a very small space. According to American newspapers, the actions and dialogues in the film are no different from those usually shown. However, when the aircraft ascends and the speed increases suddenly, the figures on the screen are slightly distorted. The dialogue is also disturbed by the sound of the aircraft, but it can be restored in a moment, so it is not too much of an obstacle. Flying in the air is originally the most lonely, and in the future, wireless movies can be used for entertainment. Therefore, due to the success of this experiment, many believe that in the future, wireless movies will be shown in all long-distance passenger aircraft to relieve the loneliness of passengers.

### Kettle Studio Opera Talk: Anti-Erh Huang and Anti-Xi Pi

— Su Shaoqing

There are many names for Peking opera tunes, each with its own nature, meaning, and function. Today, we will talk about Anti-Erh Huang and Anti-Xi Pi. "Anti" means change. Both of these are changed tunes. Military strategists have both orthodox and unorthodox strategies, and music and songs have both orthodox and changed forms. This is the natural course of things. Erh Huang originated in the Yangtze River basin. Its sound is slow and harmonious, the same as the southern tunes of Kunqu opera. When it changes to Anti-Erh Huang, it is used to express sorrowful emotions, as exemplified by "The Cries of the Witch Ape in the Gorges."

Old male roles, such as "Bumping the Stele," "The Clay Pot Case," "Changing Sons at the Execution Ground," "Herding Sheep Circle," and "Chaisang Port"; young female roles, such as "Sacrificing at the Pagoda," "Sacrificing at the River," "Falling Flower Garden," "Cosmos Edge," and "Selling Pastries"; and young male roles, such as "Seeking Righteousness and Chastity" and "Small Display," all borrow the tune of Anti-Erh Huang to express infinite sorrow. Xi Pi is a branch of Qinqiang opera, produced in the mountains and fields. Its sound is high-pitched and intense. When changed to Anti-Xi Pi, it is specially used to sing out sorrowful emotions, which is perfectly embodied in "The Cries of the Cuckoo Bird in Blood." Anti-Xi Pi has no slow tempo, only two types: Er Liu (commonly called Er Liu) and San Ban. Old male roles have it. In "Lianying Stockade," Liu Bei cries for the deceased, singing Anti-Xi Pi Er Liu; in "Fish Gut Sword," Wu Zixu plays the Xiao flute in the Wu market, singing Anti-Xi Pi San Ban; and in "Visiting the Mother," bidding farewell to his wife and crying in the hall, also singing Anti-Xi Pi San Ban. However, in Anti-Xi Pi, whether it is Er Liu or San Ban, it must return to the orthodox tune of Xi Pi at the end, because Anti-Xi Pi is actually infringing on Erh Huang tune. If it goes without returning, it will become Erh Huang. (To be continued)

### Guohua Tidbits

— Quan

Combining the wit of ancient and modern times in one place, performing both modern and historical dramas at the same time can be said to be Guohua's unique creation. "Li Amao and Dongfang Shuo" is this unprecedented attempt. Yesterday, Li Amao and Dongfang Shuo met in Nantiandou. One said, "Could the one who comes be Senior Dongfang Shuo?" and the other said, "Could the one who comes be Dr. Li Amao?" The opening line is already hilarious. In this segment, there are many new jokes, all of which are far-fetched. They are playing tricks in the clouds, and no one will see that it is the effect of the scenery, which shows the high skill of the art department.

The craftsmen were busy for three days, and only one scene was filmed. This is the champion parade in "The Love Story of Su San." Shu Shi plays Wang Jinlong, who won the top spot in the imperial examination and was ordered to parade through the streets. The drums and music were loud, and the scene was extremely grand. There were as many as 285 extras playing the audience and shopkeepers on both sides,衬托着堂皇富丽的排塲，眞是牡丹綠葉，相得益彰。
