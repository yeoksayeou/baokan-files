### The Chinese Army's Encirclement of the Japanese in Guangxi: A Grand Achievement
### More Than Half of the Japanese Troops on Both Sides of the Yongqin Road Annihilated by the Chinese Army
### Shibu, Tanbailangwei and Other Places Have Been Recovered
### The Chinese Side Concentrates Twenty Divisions to Attack Jiutang

Guilin: The Japanese troops in the Nanning area have now begun to realize they are in a desperate situation and are struggling to escape. They have been creating disturbances in all directions for days. The Chinese army, with a firm posture and agile actions, has met them in battle on different routes, encircling them individually and inflicting fatal blows everywhere. Since yesterday morning, the Japanese troops advancing towards Yongbin Road have been completely surrounded by the Chinese army on both sides of the Yongbin Road on the north bank of the Yong River. The Japanese troops on the Yongchun side were not able to complete their crossing of the river before being completely surrounded by the Chinese on the riverbank. The Japanese troops on both sides of the Yongzhen Road had already been more than half annihilated by the Chinese army, and are now being encircled and annihilated everywhere. The Japanese troops on the Yongwu Road side did not dare to move this time. The Chinese army has again recovered Shibu, twelve kilometers west of Nanning. The Japanese troops have retreated to the suburbs and are trapped in the city.

Only yesterday did the spokesman say that the Japanese army had begun its offensive on January 28. Its purpose was not to occupy more towns, but to defeat the Chinese army around Jiutang. Now the Chinese army has moved south from Binyang to Jiutang, concentrating more than twenty divisions, reportedly attempting to capture Jiutang. The spokesman then showed a map, explaining the Japanese army's strategy of encircling and defeating the Chinese army, and claiming that the Chinese army had also moved to encircle the Japanese army.

Editorial

### Preventing Theft and Eliminating Theft

Recently, reports of robbery have been endless, especially the robbery on Shanxi Road the night before, which was even more shocking. The police mobilized two or three hundred Chinese and Western detectives, both mounted and foot, and confronted the robbers for several hours, firing hundreds of shots at each other. It was not until tear gas was used that the robbers were arrested. Considering the situation, imagining with closed eyes, it was no less than street fighting, which should not have happened in the downtown area. In terms of the Shanghai Municipal Council's facilities for protecting citizens, it can be said that they were rapid, comprehensive, and well-prepared. As soon as an alarm was heard, they were immediately dispatched. Police cars were like shuttles, and detectives were like a forest. However, the bandits were bold as the sky and openly resisted arrest. Is this not what is called "not fearing death"? Or are they truly not afraid of death! Are they willingly treading on the law! Apart from a few stubborn and incorrigible outlaws by nature, there are also those who cannot overcome the temptations of society and the oppression of the environment, and those who willingly degenerate and those who are forced to do so are almost half and half.

In this chaotic season, there is no doubt about strict laws and severe punishments. As for comprehensive precautions and detectives spread everywhere, they are necessary measures for those who bear the responsibility of local security. However, the effectiveness of these measures is still doubtful. Even if they are very effective, their effect is only to prevent theft. What we find most difficult to refrain from speaking about is the way to eliminate theft, which must be urgently sought. Because Shanghai society is extravagant, full of tempting traps. Even the Shanghai Municipal Council's annual report states that entertainment venues are lined up, with neon lights shining everywhere. It can be seen how ugly the general scene is, and how the sins that arise from it are. What is entertainment? Everywhere there are singing stages and dance halls, everywhere there are brothels and gambling dens, all of which are gold-consuming holes. How can these be maintained by several millionaires and rich young men who spend money like dirt? The vast majority of customers rely on scheming for income. To say that they abandon themselves and eventually degenerate, to say that their affairs and their people are not worth pitying, in terms of society, this is indeed where bandits breed; this is one. Rice is more than forty yuan per stone, flour is more than twelve yuan per bag, and the market price of all necessities of life is three or four times higher than before the war, or even eight or ten times higher. The difficulty of life needs no detailed description. This is still bearable for those in the salaried class, let alone the unemployed masses and foreign refugees, who have no way to feed themselves and are waiting to die. Those who can no longer restrain themselves do not need to have the heart of thieves, nor do they need to have the skills of thieves, and eventually enter the path of thieves and commit the crimes of thieves; this is two. In the past year, prices have soared and have not decreased. As long as there are goods in hand, there is no disadvantage to making three times the profit. Speculation, manipulation, hoarding and speculation, making a fortune from national disaster, and getting rich overnight. Thus, they compete for food and drink, indulge in lust, and exhaustively squander. As for the consequences of these extravagant acts for themselves and their descendants, it is not worth discussing. But there are evil consequences that are left to society, such as the disparity between wealth and poverty, which provokes the hearts of the strong to covet, and teaches licentiousness and theft, which is inevitable; this is three. Fugitives have a hiding place, and criminals have a place to hide. Although there is only a small distance, the situation is different. In terms of morality, it is hell, and in terms of thieves, it is heaven. With only a small distance, there is no fear. This is why the boldness of the bandits is growing and their flames are becoming more intense; this is four. With these four reasons, how can theft be prevented, let alone eliminated? Therefore, there are those who cannot help but reminisce about Shanghai and the environment of Shanghai in the past.

Sin has its origin, responsibility has its belonging, and sweeping away the haze can only wait for the overall situation to clear up. However, speaking of Shanghai in Shanghai, at least a method of reducing thieves should be sought. As it is a matter of personal concern, the authorities of the concession and the residents within the concession should not let it go on like this. Because today's situation is not only unable to eliminate theft, but also unable to prevent theft. Not only is it unable to prevent theft, but it also directly and indirectly cultivates the production of theft and stimulates the rampantness of theft. Do not say that it is necessary to get to the root of the problem, but also to prescribe the right medicine. In our humble opinion, everyone in the concession authorities and the residents within the concession should plan to share their obligations. In general, stabilizing general life is the best strategy for eliminating theft. If it is possible to restrain the excessive desire for personal wealth, and to encourage each other to restrain it, and to take collective action in order to stabilize prices, and not only not participate in those who manipulate, speculate, hoard and speculate, but also try to counteract their evil deeds, then prices will tend to stabilize, which is to stabilize people's hearts and benefit society. It should be known that in social affairs, if one more person contributes, there will be a point of effect. The effect may not be obvious, but the benefit is indelible. Those who own assets must think of using them in various relief undertakings, so that the poor and the helpless can be benefited. There are many commentators who advocate abstinence from consumption and advocating frugality from a moral point of view and a private economic point of view, and we do not want to blindly follow them. However, in order to maintain social security and comfort the psychology of the poor, it is necessary to stay away from indulgence and luxury, which can be believed that the wealthy also have their obligations. In short, thieves are not the majority, but the creation of thieves is often caused directly or indirectly by the majority. Knowing this, the majority should know what to avoid.

### Japanese Parliament Launches Questioning Battle: Focus on How to Resolve the "China Incident"; Saito's Remarks Cause Extreme Indignation in the Military; Newspapers Unanimously Agree New Cabinet Lacks Political Skill

Tokyo: The plenary session of the House of Representatives convened today at 2:16 PM. Following various reports, the second round of questioning of the Ministers of State commenced.

Togo Minoru (Nakajima faction of the Seiyukai party) took the floor and raised questions regarding the handling of the China Incident, stating, "The most important issue for Japan now is to resolve the incident, seek stability in East Asia, and construct a New East Asia. Therefore, diplomacy must exert its full strength to concentrate on this goal. For enemy countries that aim to disrupt East Asian peace and hinder the co-prosperity of Japan, China, and 'Manchukuo,' decisive countermeasures must be taken. What Japan needs today is to display autonomous diplomacy backed by strength. I wonder if the current cabinet has such awareness. The necessary prerequisite for so-called autonomous diplomacy is the strengthening of national defense. Relying on third countries for important military supplies is not the path to completing national defense independence. I wonder what the government's intentions are regarding the establishment of a national policy for national defense resources. To achieve the sacred task, a comprehensive reform and reorganization of the national system is necessary."

After forcefully advocating for innovative policies, he also addressed the Japanese political system, stating, "Why does the current cabinet lack the courage to boldly seek national opinion on the merits of innovative policies? Also, the problem of daily necessities, with price policies as the center, needs to be re-examined. Especially regarding the United States, it is urgently necessary to implement countermeasures under a plan to establish a wartime food policy. How will the current cabinet handle this?" He then shifted his arguments to inflation, the increase in purchasing power, and inflation prevention measures, asking, "A fundamental reconstruction of the wartime economic system must be resolutely carried out. The 'movement of things' principle must be reformed, and its emphasis thoroughly implemented. Under national planning, creating a labor system is an urgent task. The budget for the fifteenth year is an unprecedentedly large budget. The Minister of the Army, at a meeting of directly subordinate unit commanders, instructed them to strive for economy. This is the attitude that the government should hold for the entire budget. Does the government have this intention?"

He further transitioned to the issue of government organization, arguing, "A hastily formed cabinet without any political foundation cannot fulfill the important task of assistance. Recently, the driving force of politics has been alienated by the general public, so political power is extremely impoverished and ununified, and national opinion no longer knows where to converge." Finally, he asked what views the current cabinet holds on carrying out this strong political action.

Prime Minister Yonai replied that the establishment of a "New Government" in China is a step forward in dealing with the incident, and the government has decided on a policy to make various preparations to assist the "New Government." Regarding diplomatic affairs, the government is determined to adjust national relations from an autonomous standpoint and move toward the goal of resolving the situation.

Foreign Minister Arita replied that Japan has decided not to intervene in the European war and will concentrate on building a new order in East Asia, with the aim of contributing to world peace. It will also deal with international relations with an autonomous policy and consistently conduct its affairs with fairness and righteousness.

Commerce and Industry Minister Fujiwara replied that implementing economic controls, preparing the wartime system in advance, and adhering to a low-price policy are necessary. It will strive to avoid raising prices in order to stabilize the lives of the people.

Finance Minister Sakurai replied that the government will consider the issue of implementing the budget with a cautious attitude, and when implementing the budget, it will focus on recovering funds and saving consumption to adjust and control the economy.

Next, Katsuta made an answer related to the electricity problem. After that, from the Minsei Party,

Saito Takao took the floor and asked,

"The root cause of this incident lies in the mutual lack of understanding between the Chinese and Japanese peoples. At that time, the situation between China and Japan made conflict unavoidable, so in order to resolve the incident, it is necessary to remove this fundamental cause between the two sides. What is the government's view on this? Also, the Konoe Statement is an outline for handling the incident, but I have some different opinions. The Konoe Statement states: (1) Respect for Chinese sovereignty; (2) No demand for territory or reparations; (3) Economic cooperation between China and Japan; (4) No restrictions on the rights and interests of first countries in China; (5) Withdrawal of Japanese troops from areas other than Inner Mongolia. Since the establishment of the "New Government" has already followed the path of this Konoe Statement and is becoming concrete, our country, which supports this "New Government," must absolutely not change this statement. That is self-evident. Therefore, what I want to ask is what the government's interpretation is of the important items of the Konoe Statement. Also, what exactly is the concrete concept of the so-called "New Order in East Asia"? According to the Konoe Statement, the content of this term can be interpreted as the following points: (1) Good-neighborly friendship; (2) Joint anti-communism; (3) Economic cooperation. Does the so-called "New Order" mean these three points? The establishment of the Chinese "New Government" is truly important, but what must be considered is the issue of the capabilities of the "New Government." Does the "New Government" have military strength? Or not? Also, when the "New Government" is established, what will be its relationship with the Chongqing regime? Can the "New Government" echo our country's unwavering principle of "not negotiating with Chiang Kai-shek" and adopt the same course of action as us, also absolutely not negotiating with the Chongqing regime? On this point, I would like a clear answer from the government."

Prime Minister Yonai replied, "Japan's policy on handling the incident is firm and immovable, and we will continue to move forward along this policy. The New Government has the same will as our country. Japan recognizes that it truly has strength and truly has ability, and intends to do its best to help its development. As for the relationship between the New Government and the Chongqing regime, they are temporarily in a confrontational position, which is unavoidable. However, we hope that the Chongqing regime can disintegrate and join the New Government. As for domestic problems, the government is determined to establish comprehensive measures in all aspects."

Finance Minister Sakurai replied, "Regarding the issue of economic assistance to the New Government, Japan will provide assistance to the extent of its capabilities." Next, Director-General Sakurakawa of the Asia Development Board stated that the Asia Development Committee will continue to study the fundamental principles of the "New Order in East Asia." The meeting adjourned at 5:03 PM. (2nd day, Dōmei News Agency)

Tokyo: The Army authorities are extremely indignant because of the inappropriate remarks made by Saito Takao of the Minsei Party in his speech in the House of Representatives today regarding the handling of the China Incident. They held a leaders' meeting in the Army government committee room in the House of Representatives and conducted important discussions. As a result, they believe that Saito Takao's speech insults the purpose of the Japanese military's operations and defiles the spirits of 200,000 Imperial soldiers. Therefore, they immediately requested Vice Minister Miyoshi to ask Saito to withdraw his inappropriate remarks. On the other hand, they decided that if he does not agree to withdraw them, they will take some action. Army Minister Hata also plans to request to speak on the floor of the House of Representatives tomorrow, the 3rd, to make a comprehensive response to Saito's speech from the Army's standpoint, and at the same time actively state his belief in the "holy war." Also, the Nakajima faction of the Seiyukai Party, the Current Affairs Comrades Association, and the Social Mass Party believe that Saito's use of inappropriate remarks in his questioning was a misstep. Therefore, after the Diet adjourned, they separately held emergency meetings of representatives to discuss countermeasures. As a result, they decided to issue a statement demanding withdrawal and apology. They plan to take appropriate measures against Saito if he does not comply, so this matter is quite important. (2nd day, Dōmei News Agency)

### State of the Diet Session

Tokyo: The Japanese Diet, which reopened on the 2nd, continued the previous day's questioning of the Ministers of State's policy speeches, creating an overall opening battle. The House of Peers convened a plenary session at 10:00 AM, where Prince Okouchi Terutake (Research Society) raised the "Asama Maru" incident. From a legal and political perspective, the main points of his questioning were as follows:

(1) How is international law interpreted? (2) Why were Germans with such suspicions allowed to board the Asama Maru? (3) Did the authorities issue orders to the captain? (4) How will passenger qualifications be regulated in the future?

Foreign Minister Arita replied to this, with the main points as follows:

(1) Japan's interpretation is always based on national law. Britain expressed its views in an official document. Japan submitted a reply to Britain in an official document. (2) Initially, it was believed that third countries could not arrest Germans on board, so their boarding had been refused. (3) When the European war broke out, the authorities issued orders to the captain, instructing him to take temporary measures to avoid unnecessary disputes when inspected by related countries.

Next, Navy Minister Yoshida also replied, stating that such incidents should first be entrusted to diplomatic negotiations. The Navy authorities are prepared to take appropriate measures if negotiations cannot be resolved satisfactorily. As to whether or not to use force, it is not convenient to state at present.

Okouchi also asked about the issue of adjusting national relations and inquired about the Foreign Minister's beliefs.

Foreign Minister Arita replied that the fundamental diplomatic policy had been fully stated in his speech on the 1st. Building a "New Order in East Asia" is an attempt to stabilize East Asia in order to realize world human peace. All international relations originate from this fundamental policy. As for the anti-communism problem, this has been handled by successive foreign ministers and is an established policy of Japanese diplomacy.

Okouchi also touched on the issue of the Chinese "New Central Government" and questioned the special nature of North China and Mengjiang, its relationship and communication with foreign countries, and other issues.

The Prime Minister replied to this, saying, "Japan will spare no effort to cooperate in assisting the Chinese 'New Government' in order to bring about its early establishment. For other broad issues, we will reply as opportunities arise."

Okouchi also turned to domestic issues and requested the government to take active action.

Finally, Naito Hisahiro (Research Society) stood up to review and dissect the current cabinet's internal and external policies. (2nd day, Dōmei News Agency)

The staff members of various morning newspapers in Tokyo held critical attitudes towards the speeches made in the Diet yesterday. The Hochi Shimbun pointed out a lack of statesmanship. The Kokumin Shimbun expressed disappointment in the ministers' mundane speeches. The Asahi Shimbun stated that, broadly speaking, the financial community recognizes that Finance Minister Sakuragi's remarks lacked strength and creativity, and was therefore quite disappointed. Sakuragi's failure to deal with the steps already proposed to prevent the adverse inflation associated with the use of the massive budget was particularly unpopular. (2nd day, Reuters)

### Japan Does Not Abandon its Policy of Aggression Against China: China Decides to Fight to the End; Saodang Bao Comments on Arita's Speech: Hopes Major Powers Will Not Be Deceived

Chongqing: The Saodang Bao, the organ of the Chinese Army, published an editorial today discussing in detail Foreign Minister Arita's speech in the Diet yesterday outlining Japan's policy, stating, "If Japan does not abandon its policy of aggression against China, China will continue armed resistance. If third countries take effective measures to curb Japan, then Japan will collapse immediately thereafter. After the successful conclusion of the Sino-Japanese War, China will, as an independent and sovereign nation, permit third countries to freely trade and invest in China in accordance with the principles of equality and mutual benefit. On the other hand, if the war continues, Japan will use various methods to discriminate against third countries' trade and investment in China before its final collapse. 'Manchukuo' is a good example for all to see. If third countries give aid to China, they will not only uphold conditions, rights and justice, but also protect their own interests in China. The Chinese government and people are deeply grateful for the sympathy expressed by third countries in the past two years. Now that Japan is nearing collapse, we hope that third countries will continue to uphold their policy of curbing aggression." (2nd day, Reuters)

### US Decides to Protect its Interests in China; Not Subdued by Japanese Threats; Pittman and Vandenberg Issue Warnings: US May Impose Embargo on Japan

Washington: US Republican Senator Vandenberg stated here yesterday that imposing an embargo on Japan "may be the first step to war." But he warned Japan not to ignore the possibility that the United States may impose an embargo on Japan. Before Vandenberg issued his statement, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman denounced Japan's attempt to interfere with the US Congress. Vandenberg is the proposer of the abolition of the 1911 US-Japan Treaty of Commerce. He said that the abolition of the Treaty of Commerce is "more moderate" than the embargo proposal put forward by Pittman. Vandenberg has sent his views to Lippmann, the editor of a political column in a newspaper in this city, asking him to publish them. Vandenberg stated, "No matter how much sympathy we have, no matter how we feel about Japan's atrocities in trying to conquer China, our foreign policy is not to force Japan to withdraw from China, but only to protect American interests. Although, the United States may impose an embargo on Japan, if Japan ignores this danger, it will feel misled." Vandenberg opposes the suggestion that the United States must bear the responsibility of maintaining the Nine-Power Treaty alone, because all the signatory countries must be responsible for this. At the same time, Pittman also issued a statement in response to news from Tokyo that Japan would regard the imposition of an embargo as a "serious insult" to Japan. He denounced Japanese military officials for being "insensitive" to American treaty rights in the Far East. He said, "If the United States is subdued by the current Japanese threats, the rights enjoyed by American expatriates in the Far East will lead to endless trouble. The statements made by the Japanese side seem to be more threatening than reasonable complaints. When Congress passed the Tariff Act of 1930, authorizing the President to impose a 50% tariff on any country that discriminated against American commerce, the Japanese government did not regard this as an insult to Japan. Now Congress is proposing to grant the President the power of free discretion enjoyed by any government in the world, and Japan regards this as an insult to Japan, which is truly astonishing."

Washington: Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman has proposed a bill advocating the implementation of an embargo on Japan. Well-informed sources here recently said that the government authorities are very willing to grasp a weapon as soon as possible, so that they can exert strong pressure on Japan at any time. For this reason, Pittman's bill is enough to reflect the government's point of view, but members of Congress are deeply afraid that after this measure is implemented, Japan will retaliate with fierce actions, and are still hesitant. One of the biggest concerns of the US government is that Japan and the Soviet Union will conclude a similar agreement based on the German-Soviet non-aggression pact. However, Foreign Minister Arita's speech in the House of Representatives yesterday has dispelled this concern. Germany, which originally tried to encourage Japan and the Soviet Union to approach each other, must now admit defeat, because Japan, like Italy, still approves the anti-communist policy. Diplomatic circles here also said that although Arita's speech has merits in terms of Soviet-Japanese relations, in terms of the Liu-Hua policy, Japan's attitude of insisting on establishing a "New Order in East Asia" is even stronger than before. Although Arita invited Western countries to jointly develop the Chinese economy, Japan's true intentions are already clear. In other words, that country wants to regard the entire East Asia as its "lifeline," which is no different from Germany's desire to become the sole master of the entire Eastern Europe. However, as of now, the United States has shown no signs of recognizing that country's ambitions. Not only that, but most foreign observers believe that the time is inevitably approaching when the United States will take concrete action regardless of the consequences. The only key lies in the duration of the European war. If Germany does not lose in ten days, Britain and France will not dare to provoke Japan's resentment for a single day. Therefore, the United States' diplomacy in dealing with the Far East situation must take the duration of the European war as a turning point in all its calculations. This has also been seen by the authorities in China and Japan. For example, Japanese Foreign Minister Arita has already admitted that how the European situation develops is extremely important to the Far East situation. Chiang Kai-shek, the leader of the Chinese Kuomintang, has also informally expressed to American friends that China will at least fight Japan until the end of the European war, because he believes that how the Far East problem is resolved is related to how the European war ends. In short, the United States will not act hastily until it has allies in the Far East. Therefore, although the United States has a firm determination to resist Japan's expansionist forces, the State Department still adopts a cautious attitude for the time being. Specifically, the US government hopes that Congress will pass Pittman's bill so that it can implement an embargo at any time, but it is feared that it will not resort to this extremely severe pressure until all other efforts have failed to ease Japan's attitude.

### Soviet-Japanese-Labor-"Manchu" Border Demarcation Issue: Japanese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Says: Two Committees Will Be Formed to Handle It

Tokyo: A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry said this morning when hosting reporters that the Soviet-Mongolian-Japanese-"Manchu" have agreed to form two ordinary committees to deal with the Manchurian-Mongolian border issue. One will broadly negotiate the demarcation of the border, and the other will deal with border disputes. The two committees are expected to meet soon. Regarding the spokesman's disclosure on January 31 that the Manchurian-Mongolian Border Survey Committee had been disbanded at the Harbin meeting, the spokesman said today that the committee was only handling the demarcation of the Manchurian-Mongolian border in Nomonhan. Before the dissolution, the committee issued a statement announcing its intention to dissolve because it "could not reach an agreement." (2nd day, Reuters)

### Vinson Presents Bill to US House of Representatives: Aid to the Philippines; US Builds Bases in the Pacific: Focuses on Naval Air Activities in the Future

Washington: Representative Vinson, Chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee, today introduced a bill in the House authorizing the Navy Department to sell military raw materials, materials, and equipment to the Philippines, provided that the price is not less than what the US government paid. The bill has now been submitted to the Naval Affairs Committee for discussion. According to this plan, it was originally suggested by Navy Secretary Edison to House Speaker Bankhead. According to Edison, after the enactment of this legislative bill, the US Navy Department, when assisting the Philippines when necessary, can be placed on an equal footing with the Army Department. (2nd day, Associated Press)

New York: McNutt, the former US High Commissioner to the Philippines and current Federal Security Administrator, argued in a free radio debate at City Hall yesterday that the United States should retain the Philippines, and said that trade between the Philippines and the United States is not irreconcilable. If the United States withdraws from the Philippines, it is tantamount to withdrawing from the Far East, abandoning the Asian market, and losing its prestige in the Pacific. However, Nicholas Roosevelt, the former Deputy Governor-General of the Philippines, advocated that the Philippines should be made independent in 1942, without waiting until 1946, and said that the Philippines is not economically beneficial to the United States, and has little value in terms of military and strategy. If the Philippines causes the United States to engage in war with other countries, it is no different from a great crime committed against the American people. (2nd day, Associated Press)

Washington: According to US Navy Department spokesman Commander Rovert, at a meeting of the Women's Patriotic Society today, the United States will focus on the military activities of naval aircraft in future operations in the Atlantic or Pacific. "Foreign experts all over the world recognize that American naval aviation is the best in the world. Last year, during the US Navy's large-scale exercise in the Atlantic, 500 naval aircraft flew day and night for 21 consecutive nights, but no one was killed or injured. He also said that the main line of defense of the United States in the Pacific will be the line of Alaska, Hawaii, and Samoa. The defense of this line will depend entirely on the activities of the US naval aircraft. The United States is currently building aircraft fuel depots and repair bases on this line."

### Philippine Constitution: Three Amendments: Ready to Submit to Citizen Vote

Manila: The Philippine Congressional Legal Amendment Committee today drafted a bill to amend three points of the Constitution, preparing to submit it to a citizen referendum on June 18. The first amendment is to shorten the President's term of office from six years to four years, and stipulates that he may not be re-elected. The second amendment is to change the current unicameral system to a bicameral system and increase the salaries of legislators. The last one is to establish a national election commission. It is said that these three amendments will now be combined into one case for voting, so voters must approve all of the three or reject all of them. There is no choice in between.

### Balkan Conference Opens; Discussing Joint Defense Plan; Foreign Ministers of Four Countries Held Preliminary Talks Yesterday; Decided to Extend Agreement for Seven More Years

Belgrade – The Balkan Entente conference opened here today. The foreign ministers of Greece, Romania, Turkey, and Yugoslavia held preliminary talks for half an hour. The first action of the conference was to decide that the Balkan Entente should be continued. According to the agreement, if any signatory does not give notice of withdrawal one year before the expiry date, the agreement is automatically extended for another seven years. As no country announced its withdrawal by February 1st, the conference recognized that the agreement remains in effect. It is reported that the conference will discuss a plan for joint action by the signatory countries in the event of aggression by non-Balkan countries. However, it is widely believed that the outcome of this discussion will not be made public. (Reuters, 2nd)

Capital of Yugoslavia – The standing political conference of the Balkan Entente countries held its opening ceremony this morning. The foreign ministers of Yugoslavia, Romania, Turkey, and Greece all attended. The meeting adjourned after one and a half hours and is scheduled to resume in the afternoon. Prince Paul, the Regent of Yugoslavia, hosted a luncheon for the foreign ministers of Romania, Turkey, and Greece, accompanied by the Yugoslav Foreign Minister, Mr. Magovic. In addition, Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoglu met with Mr. Bruna, the French Minister to Yugoslavia. (Havas, 2nd)

London – The standing political conference of the Balkan Entente countries has opened in the capital of Yugoslavia. Observers here generally believe that the conference may adopt important decisions on economic matters, but is unlikely to produce any concrete results on purely political issues. The reason is that if the Entente countries wish to establish a complete mutual assistance system to protect their defenses against external aggression, it is necessary for Bulgaria and Hungary to participate. This is not easily achieved, and it is also impossible to include all types of aggression in the mutual assistance treaty. According to various sources, the Entente countries will only focus on maintaining neutrality to avoid any suspicion that their policies are unfavorable to any particular country. The Entente countries deeply believe that Germany and the Soviet Union are unlikely to interfere under the current circumstances. Among them, if Germany can obtain the raw materials it needs from the Balkan Peninsula, it has no intention of interfering. Even Romania believes that the threat posed by Germany to the Balkan Peninsula countries is not very serious, and there is no real need for these countries to establish a mutual assistance system. (Havas, 2nd)

### Conference Discussions Focus on Economy

Capital of Yugoslavia – The standing political conference of the Balkan Entente is expected to focus on economic issues. Generally speaking, one aspect is to review the economic relations between the Entente countries and the belligerent countries, and the other is how to develop these economic relations under the Anglo-French blockade policy. Observers believe that Greece and Turkey are likely to initiate joint negotiations among the Entente countries to ensure that each country can obtain the maximum benefit under the Anglo-French blockade policy. It is also believed that the result of such joint action will allow the export of agricultural products from the Entente countries to obtain better conditions. In addition, the issue of Romania supplying oil to Yugoslavia is also often brought up for discussion at this conference. Politically speaking, the relations between the Entente countries and the belligerent countries and neighboring countries, as well as the political changes in the Balkan Peninsula in the past few months, will all be carefully reviewed. It is generally believed that although this conference may not produce any resolutions of a startling nature, it would be a great achievement if the representatives of the participating countries can discuss all issues frankly and openly and gain a greater understanding of each other. (Havas, 1st)

### Berlin and Rome Exert Pressure

Capital of Yugoslavia – The conference convened by the Balkan Entente countries is bound to fail because Berlin and Rome are now increasing pressure on the foreign ministers of the Little Entente. The Italian government's official gazette, "Political Newspaper," stated that the conference should focus on improving Hungarian-Romanian relations and establishing a Balkan defense line against the expansion of Soviet power. The newspaper also said that the Italian government is now closely monitoring the development of the conference and pointed out that the Little Entente countries are incapable of solving the Balkan problem because Hungary and Bulgaria are not participating. (United Press, 2nd)

### Time Not Ripe for Military Alliance

Istanbul – The Turkish government is now focusing on the upcoming Balkan conference, hoping that the Little Entente countries can find appropriate methods at the conference to form a joint Balkan and Danube defense line to cope with future threats. Turkey has recently made great diplomatic efforts to form a united front. (United Press, 2nd)

Istanbul – Turkish newspapers have expressed negative comments on the Balkan conference. "Saba Newspaper" stated that hoping the Balkan and Danube countries to conclude a military alliance is like climbing a tree to catch fish. "Ikren Newspaper" also said that it is impossible for the Balkan countries to conclude a defense alliance including Hungary and Bulgaria, and that the Balkan Entente has not yet reached a mature stage. (Haitong Telegraph, 2nd)

### Turkish Foreign Minister Meets in Sofia; Talks with Bulgarian Dignitaries

Sofia – Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoglu, en route from Istanbul to the capital of Yugoslavia, passed through Sofia yesterday afternoon to visit Bulgarian dignitaries. When the train arrived at the station, Bulgarian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Koseivanov and a representative of Bulgarian Prince Boris greeted him at the railway station. After a thirty-minute meeting, the journey continued. The Bulgarian Prime Minister attached a flower car and accompanied him to the border town of Dragoman. The Turkish Foreign Minister made a statement to reporters, declaring that the negotiations he had conducted with the Bulgarian Prime Minister were beneficial to both parties, and that the two countries had decided to maintain peace, which was of great importance not only to the Balkans but also to the whole of Europe. (Haitong Telegraph, 2nd)

Sofia – Observers here commented that relations between Turkey and Bulgaria have recently improved. Although Bulgaria has no representatives participating in the standing political conference of the Balkan Entente countries, nor has it sent observers, the Turkish Foreign Minister may be able to explain Bulgaria's views on its behalf. (Havas, 2nd)

### Hungary and Bulgaria Still Have Not Abandoned Territorial Claims Against Romania

Capital of Hungary – Although Hungary did not send observers to the conference of the Balkan Entente countries scheduled to open tomorrow, political figures here still pay great attention to it, and especially to the attitude of Turkey. It is believed that the conference may not have any startling results. Newspapers all state that Hungary and Bulgaria have the same interests in certain aspects. For example, the Hungarian newspaper reported that Hungary and Bulgaria both have territorial claims on Romania (Bulgaria demanding the return of the Dobruja region, Hungary demanding the return of Outer Transylvania Province). "Romania is still stubbornly trying to maintain the territorial status quo, which can be said to be obsessed. Should the country continue to play with fire, or should it sign a reasonable insurance policy with its neighbors (this kind of insurance policy can also be guaranteed by Italy) so that the current war does not extend to the Balkan Peninsula, should be decided at this conference." (Havas, 1st)

### The Netherlands Still Wishes for Honorable Peace with the Soviet Union; Statement by Finnish President in Parliament; British and American Aircraft Arrive in Finland for Combat

Capital of Finland – The House of Representatives reconvened today. President Kallio immediately attended and delivered a speech, stating that Finland is prepared to negotiate an honorable peace with the Soviet Union. He said, "Before the outbreak of war between Finland and the Soviet Union, although we had no dispute with the Soviet Union, we still conducted negotiations at its request. At that time, we had already expressed our readiness to accept great sacrifices to maintain peace. However, the country suddenly suspended negotiations and concluded an agreement with some Finnish communists (referring to Kuusinen, etc.) who had left the country a few years ago. In other words, the Soviet authorities blatantly refused to negotiate with the legitimate government of Finland, seeing that the country not only wanted to conquer land, but also wanted to Bolshevize our country. In fact, the Soviet Union added barbaric aggressive actions, which is irrational. We are still prepared to negotiate an honorable peace with them. This time, the Finnish nation has demonstrated great moral strength and spirit of sacrifice in order to defend its rights and prevent the spread of Bolshevism. The greatness of our nation has therefore been recognized by the world. However, at present, we hope that others will give us assistance, especially humanitarian assistance, so that we can protect our civilians when Soviet aircraft attack. In short, the people of our country are now unanimously supporting the government. Although the army of our country is far outnumbered by the Red Army, it has eliminated many divisions of the Soviet army. Its morale is strong and its combat capability is strong." (Havas, 1st)

London – This morning, newspapers here reported that several British and American aircraft have arrived in Finland, and most have joined the fighting. Most of the British aircraft are Gloster Gladiators and Bristol Blenheim bombers. It is said that they have fully demonstrated their performance is superior to the Soviet Union. The American aircraft are Curtiss Hawk fighter planes. Although the number of aircraft currently in Finland is still less than that of the Soviet Union, it has begun to threaten the Soviet Union's air superiority. (Reuters, 2nd)

New York – The New York Times reported that Sweden has ordered 150 fighter planes from the United States, stating that they are urgently needed. The price is eight million US dollars. It is said that these aircraft are planned to be sent to Finland to help fight. (Haitong Telegraph, 2nd)

### Soviet-Finnish War Situation

Moscow – According to a communiqué from the headquarters of the Leningrad Military District, three enemy aircraft were shot down by our air force on the front line on February 1st. Our air force also conducted reconnaissance flights and bombed enemy military targets. In addition, there were no major developments on the front line. (TASS, 2nd)

Capital of Finland – The communiqué issued last night stated that the Soviet army was repulsed while attacking northeast of Lake Ladoga and suffered military injuries. The Soviet army also attacked Petrozavodsk in the Salla area, but was repulsed. Rovaniemi was bombed yesterday. Soviet aircraft also flew over other towns and cities. Dozens of civilians died and forty were injured in the air raids. The Finnish side shot down two Soviet aircraft. (Reuters, 2nd)

Stockholm – Rovaniemi, Finland, was madly bombed by Soviet aircraft yesterday. The post office and all telephone communications were completely destroyed. The number of casualties is countless. A bomb shelter built of reinforced concrete was also destroyed by a 100-kilogram Soviet bomb, killing seven people and injuring thirty. Therefore, the authorities have ordered civilians in the city to engage in evacuation work. (United Press, 2nd)

Capital of Finland – According to news from Tallinn, the Estonian authorities admitted yesterday that aircraft from a foreign country had repeatedly bombed Soviet air bases in Estonia in the past few weeks. The last time was on January 28th. The Paldiski base was heavily bombed, and the fire was visible from several miles away. The Soviet authorities were completely unprepared for the first attack on the base, and many aircraft hangars and aircraft were destroyed. Almost all Soviet air bases in Estonia were attacked. The Soviet Union later summoned the commander of the Paldiski base and others back to the country. They have not returned since going to Leningrad, and have probably been shot. (Reuters, 2nd)

Capital of Sweden – According to a report from Helsinki, the Russian army in Kalinin has now begun attacking Summa. After the mountain artillery intensively fired for six hours, they used armored forces to cover the infantry attack, and a large number of aircraft assisted in the battle. The battle is currently in full swing. (Haitong Telegraph, 2nd)

### Various Countries Aid Finland

### Soviet Ambassador to the United States; Visits Hull for Lengthy Talk; Conversation Was of a General Nature

Washington – Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Mr. Umansky, visited Secretary of State Hull today, following instructions from his government, and engaged in a lengthy conversation.

Secretary of State Hull also said when hosting reporters that the conversation was of a general nature and no decisions were made. (Havas, 1st)

New York "New York Times" recently published a telegram from Washington stating that when Soviet Ambassador Umansky held talks with Secretary of State Hull yesterday, it was reported that it involved two matters: (1) Assistant Secretary of War Johnson recently gave a speech saying, "The proverb says that one free man is worth dozens of slaves," which has been proven in the Soviet-Finnish war. Umansky protested against this. (2) The US government has implemented a moral embargo against the Soviet Union, advising domestic businessmen not to sell aircraft and oil refining machines to the Soviet Union. Umansky also expressed dissatisfaction with Secretary of State Hull. (Havas, 2nd)

### Japanese Announce; Reason for Arresting American Journalist; Alleging Yang Violated Japanese Military Criminal Law

Tokyo – The detailed charges for which Mr. Yang, the Far East Manager of the International News Service, was detained by the police station on January 20th, were announced by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman at a press conference today. It is said that according to the provisions of the Army Code, Mr. Yang has committed the following crimes: (1) Between October last year and June of this month, Mr. Yang sent thirty-eight articles with extremely slanderous news about the Japanese army fighting in various parts of China to the US International News Service headquarters and various Japanese newspapers and magazines. (2) Between January 6th and 19th, he spread false news and rumors about the actions of the Japanese army in China to many Japanese and foreigners at the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo. The spokesman continued that the case is still under investigation, and it is currently impossible to say whether it will be handed over to a civil court or a military court for trial. Japan has not received any protests from the US ambassador regarding this case. According to semi-official sources, Mr. Yang will be charged with violating the Army Law and Articles 1, 3, and 99. Article 99 stipulates that anyone who fabricates rumors about military affairs during wartime or in an emergency will be sentenced to imprisonment of not more than three years. Articles 2 and 3 stipulate that the Army Law may also be applied to people who do not serve in the military and actions taken outside of Japanese territory. Mr. Yang has been living in Japan for a long time and worked for the American-owned Japan Advertiser. He returned to the United States for vacation in 1938 and returned to Tokyo in May last year. He traveled to China in October and returned to Tokyo on June of this year. (Reuters, 2nd)

Chongqing – The official report of the National Resources Commission states that although the government is at war, it is still making every effort to carry out its program to develop various heavy industries. The committee currently operates eight coal mines, two each in Sichuan, Hunan, and Yunnan provinces, and one each in Jiangxi and Guizhou provinces. It is currently engaged in

Drilling Oil Wells

in various parts of the country.

A well near Chongqing has been drilled to a depth of 1,400 meters. The oil wells in Gansu Province have also had good results. A distillation plant will be established soon. Important components of the Hanyang Iron and Steel Plant in Hankou, weighing a total of 40,000 tons, have been transported to Sichuan for installation.

Yunnan Steel Plant

Because there is an iron and coal mine in the province, it is currently being developed. Yunnan Province has clearly become the center of China's heavy industry. The committee has also established a central machinery factory in the province.

Electrical Appliances

Manufacturing plants have been established in Guizhou and Yunnan provinces, producing copper and iron wires, light bulbs, vacuum tubes, military and ordinary telephones, motors, generator transformers, and dry batteries.

### Wang-Japan Agreement; Pan Gongzhan's Statement

Chongqing – Deputy Minister of Propaganda Pan Gongzhan, in a speech here recently, questioned the denial by Wang Jingwei in Hong Kong of the agreement recently announced that he had entered into with Japan. It is said that there are many contradictory remarks in the denials issued by Wang Jingwei and his party. Wang's mouthpiece first insisted that the agreement was only a Japanese proposal. Another mouthpiece of Wang's said that the agreement was not the final agreement signed by Wang and the Japanese side, and that the final agreement was quite different from the one announced in Hong Kong. It also said that the so-called final agreement has never been announced. At the same time, Wang himself flatly denied, insisting that he had never signed any agreement. However, in his telegram to Chairman Chiang on January 16th, he said, "We have already obtained peace conditions." If this does not mean that an agreement has been concluded, what does it mean? Wang has dismissed Tao Xisheng, Gao Zongwu, and Chen Gongbo, who have recently deviated from his peace movement, from their original positions. (Reuters, 2nd)

Chongqing – The Dagongbao, Shishi Xinbao, Xinshu Bao, Guomin Gongbao, Xinmin Bao, Shangwu Ribao, Xinhua Ribao, Saodang Bao, Zhongyang Xinbao, Xinan Ribao Evening Edition, Nanjing Evening News, and the Sichuan Chengdu Central Daily News, and another one hundred and twenty newspaper offices express deep pain and anger about the secret Wang-Japan agreement.

It is reported that newspaper offices all over the country have responded in unison. (Telegraph, 2nd)

### Frontline Soldiers; Send One Letter Home Per Month; Regulations Stipulated by the Ministry of Military Affairs

Chongqing – The Ministry of Military Affairs issued a recent circular here today stipulating that frontline soldiers must send

one letter home per month.

local officials

to ask teachers and students in the area to assist. One jiao will be deducted from each soldier's monthly salary to cover the cost of stamps, stationery, and envelopes. (Reuters, 2nd)

### The Battle of Kunlun Pass: War Trophies Exhibited in Guilin; Transported from Kunlun, Attracting Eager Crowds Along the Way; A Total of Twenty-One Trucks Filled with Cannons, Machine Guns, and More

A dispatch from Guilin reports that the victory at Kunlun Pass holds a pivotal significance for the entire war situation. Beyond the strategic and tactical value, the sheer numbers regarding casualties and captured war trophies are astonishing. Over five to six thousand enemy troops, including the brigade commander of the Japanese Nakamura Masao's brigade and the regimental commander Miki, were annihilated. The spoils of war are countless, earned through the blood and spirit of the fearless Chinese soldiers.

Rumors had circulated earlier about the war trophies being transported to Guilin, stirring immense excitement among the city's residents. On January 15th, this consignment of war trophies, escorted by Li Chengyi, a counselor from the 囗 Corps, arrived in Guilin.

Starting from the 16th, a public exhibition was held at the public sports ground. The war trophies were transported from Kunlun Pass in twenty-one trucks, passing through Binyang and Liuzhou before reaching Guilin. Entering the city through the South Gate, the twenty-one trucks formed a neat and solemn procession, resembling a "single-file long snake formation." The Chinese national flag and the Kuomintang party flag were prominently displayed on the first truck, fluttering in the wind as symbols of boundless glory. Several trucks behind carried one or two Japanese flags hanging upside down, which was quite exhilarating and stimulating. Onlookers lining the streets applauded and cheered for these gifts of victory.

The inventory of war trophies includes one field gun, three mountain guns, one anti-tank gun, four heavy machine guns, over ten light machine guns, over five hundred rifles, over forty thousand rounds of heavy machine gun ammunition, over eighty thousand rounds of rifle ammunition, as well as numerous other artillery shells, poison gas, helmets, gas masks, parachutes, and military documents. The brothers of the 囗 Corps, who were responsible for the escort, stood armed on each truck, each wearing a triumphant smile. They mentioned that this was just a small portion of the captured war trophies, and that more were on their way. From their conversations, it was learned that most of these trophies were obtained in the vicinity of Kunlun Pass, including Luotangbao, Jieshoubao, Tongxingbao, and the Lao Mao Ling, and the 600 Heights. Two of the mountain guns were seized by the Chinese army in combat. The remaining mountain guns, field guns, and anti-tank guns were left behind by the Japanese army during their retreat, as they were surrounded by the Chinese army and could not be transported in the rush, and were subsequently unearthed by the Chinese forces. As for the aerial supplies, the Japanese army, trapped and unable to receive reinforcements, attempted to airdrop ammunition and supplies, which were then captured by the Chinese forces. Additionally, numerous documents are currently being translated. Many warhorses are being used by the Chinese army on the front lines.

According to Counselor Li, Director Bai has emphasized the importance of these hard-won war trophies, ordering widespread publicity in various regions to boost the morale of the people in resisting the war. On the morning of the 13th, when the trucks carrying the war trophies passed through Liuzhou, tens of thousands of local residents came to visit, and businesses along the way set off firecrackers to celebrate, creating a very enthusiastic atmosphere. After much urging, they were displayed in Liuzhou for one day on the 14th. The public also eagerly viewed them when they passed through Lipu.

The war trophies were originally scheduled to be exhibited in Guilin for three days, from the 16th to the 18th. However, due to the large number of visitors, the exhibition was extended for one day, ending at 3 pm on the 19th, before being transported north. Looking at these war trophies, one can see that China is growing stronger with each battle, while the Japanese army is weakening. Final victory will surely belong to China, which is evident from the facts.

### Turmoil Erupts Again in Wuxi: Japanese Soldiers Killed at the South Gate; Japanese Side Absorbing Rice

A dispatch from Wuxi reports that the area around the South Gate of this county has traditionally been an industrial zone. Recently, due to the approaching Lunar New Year, most factories have suspended operations. A few days ago, several guerrillas suddenly appeared and ambushed two Japanese sentries at Qingming Bridge. One of the sentries was severely wounded and died shortly after. Their weapons were taken away by the guerrillas. Subsequently, a large contingent of Japanese soldiers blockaded the nearby traffic and searched house by house, but found nothing. The Japanese army, angered by the assassination of the puppet magistrate a few days ago, blamed the local residents for not reporting the guerrillas. During the curfew, they discovered a barge carrying night soil and arrested eight or nine people, who were taken to the Japanese military police headquarters in Suzhou for interrogation. They were accused of being the main assassins of Yang, and the lives of these eight or nine people are likely to be sacrificed soon.

Since the Japanese side began absorbing large quantities of rice from Wuxi, the supply has become scarce, and the current price has reached twenty-four yuan per stone. The stockpiles in various warehouses include over 400,000 dan of japonica rice, over 60,000 dan of indica rice, over 30,000 dan of yuan rice, over 30,000 dan of rough japonica rice, and over 20,000 dan of white japonica rice. The reserves are not thin. The real reason is that the Japanese are absorbing everything and transporting it to Japan. If this situation continues, there will inevitably be a rice shortage, and food for the people may become a major problem during the lean months of spring.

### Heavy Taxes and Levies Imposed by the Japanese Puppets in Dinghai; Many Residents Flee to the Countryside

A dispatch from Dinghai reports that life in Dinghai, under the military railway of the Japanese, is extremely difficult. Among other things, the price of rice, which is under the control and purchase of the Japanese, and the hoarding and speculation of corrupt merchants and gentry, has risen from eighteen yuan to thirty-three yuan. In Shenjiamen, it has risen even further to thirty-eight yuan. People dying of cold and hunger are counted daily. The prices of other daily necessities have also risen continuously. Local products of the county, such as fish and salt, are also being plundered by the Japanese, causing prices to skyrocket and making them difficult to purchase. Yellow croaker, which used to cost only a few cents each, now costs about one dime. During this period, the Japanese puppets have also increased various heavy taxes and levies, such as alcohol tax, tobacco tax, and house tax, by several times. Newly created taxes, such as patrol tax and food tax, require ordinary households to donate one to three hundred yuan, while the slightly wealthier are forced to donate up to eight hundred to two or three thousand yuan. It is nominally to hold a public sale of food, but so far it has not only not been held, but the price of rice continues to rise. Therefore, the people are filled with resentment and most of them flee to the countryside. The residents in the city are becoming increasingly scarce, and the market is becoming increasingly bleak.

The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, in order to provide relief to refugee children with secondary education levels in various refugee shelters, has held examinations once per semester through the Education Group of the Association to select outstanding refugee children and recommend them to various secondary schools in the city. This semester, because the Cili Refugee Secondary School, a branch of the Cili Association, was dissolved last year, there were still thirty to forty refugee children who could not be placed, and some refugee children in the Dunxin Road shelter planned to enter secondary school.

If each shelter has refugee children who want to enter secondary school, they can be sent to the above-mentioned schools for study. Therefore, the recruitment of refugee children has been deemed unnecessary and has been canceled.

Xiqing basketball is the hope of Chinese teams. Qianghua's defeat of Mailingbai by one point, 42 to 41, has greatly increased their hopes of winning the championship.

### Negotiations on Road Construction Beyond the Boundary; It is Rumored that the Issue of Police Power Has Been Resolved; It is Also Heard that This Agreement Was Signed Yesterday; However, Responsible Authorities Have Made No Clear Statement

Regarding the issue of road construction beyond the boundary in western Shanghai, after negotiations between Mr. Philippe, the director-general of the Public Works Department, and "Mayor" Fu Xiaoan, the main points have been concretized, and an agreement on the joint management of the administration of road construction beyond the boundary has been signed. It is understood that the agreement was signed and sealed yesterday and has been put into effect. The details are as follows:

The Rumor of Signing is Not Groundless

The Dalu Bao reported that officials have kept the negotiations on the boundary outside road area secret. However, it is heard that an agreement on the police management of the area has been prepared, signed, and put into effect. According to reliable sources, this police agreement will be signed today (2nd). Although this statement was not officially confirmed last night (1st), a senior official of the Public Works Department has indicated that this statement is not groundless.

Statements Made by Senior Officials

When reporters asked the senior official last night whether the above statement was reliable, the official avoided giving a direct answer, but said, "I suspect that the signing will not take place tomorrow. We may need more time." Although this answer is not definitive, it at least clearly indicates that if the Public Works Department and "Shanghai Mayor" Fu Xiaoan do not formally sign the agreement today, then this formal procedure is only a matter of time.

A Compromise Has Been Reached in General

It is obvious that the two sides have reached a compromise in general. The negotiations to resolve the issue of road construction beyond the boundary have been going on for more than a year. During this period, the "Shanghai Municipal Government" has used threatening tactics, resulting in incidents such as the shooting of concession police officers. The police management measures in the area of road construction beyond the boundary have been reported in the previous report, that is, the establishment of a jointly managed "Outside the Boundary Police Bureau" to govern the entire area of road construction beyond the boundary.

The Police Bureau Staff Will Each Get Half

The director of the "Police Bureau" will be appointed by the "Shanghai Municipal Government," and the deputy director will be appointed by the Public Works Department. In addition, the total number of staff will be 40, with each side appointing half. The names of the staff members must be exchanged before the final appointment is made. The Public Works Department and the "Shanghai Municipal Government" each reserve the right to refuse the name of any staff member appointed by the other side.

### Investigation Details of the Case of the Korean Being Shot

After receiving the report, Miura will decide how to handle the case. The Police Department has initiated an investigation into the case at the request of the Japanese side.

### Heavy Snowfall in Shanghai; Turns Into a Silver World; Roof Tiles, Eaves, and Roads Are Covered with Snow; More Than Two Hundred People Freeze to Death in One Day

Recently, snowflakes have floated in this city several times. Due to the mild weather, they melted as soon as they fell, and could not accumulate. Since 0:00 this morning, it has started to snow heavily. The details are recorded as follows:

Snowflakes Flutter and Accumulate

Although snowflakes have floated in this city several times, they melted as soon as they fell and could not accumulate. Therefore, they have not been of much benefit to the fields and crops. Since 0:00 this morning, it has started to snow heavily and has not stopped until noon. The roof tiles and eaves are covered with several inches of snow, and everything is white, like a silver-clad world.

Slippery Roads and Traffic Disruption

The snow on the roads accumulated thickly in the morning, with depths reaching an inch or more. Therefore, it was extremely slippery, and the accumulation was even thicker in shady places. In general, naughty children sculpted the snow into figures in the streets. The tram tracks were completely covered, and the trams could not run. Therefore, the two tram companies specially ordered workers to clear the snow first before leaving the factory. However, because the roads were slippery and the cars were slow, the Public Works Departments of the two concessions also ordered road workers to carry iron shovels and brooms to sweep the snow to the side of the road and add yellow sand and gravel to prevent pedestrians from slipping and falling. The business of trams and buses doubled, while the business of rickshaws and freight carts declined. In the afternoon, more than 1,600 rickshaw pullers stopped working due to the cold weather.

More Than Two Hundred People Freeze to Death on the Road

The number of frozen corpses in the two concessions: In the British Concession, there were 20 people in hospitals (15 more than the previous day), 60 people on the roads (24 more than the previous day), and 50 children (29 fewer than the previous day). In the French Concession, there were more than 90 people of all sizes (10 more than the previous day). More than 100 people froze to death in one day, which is the highest record this year.

Snowfall Also Occurred in the Yangtze River Basin

Although the weather was not very cold yesterday morning, it was very cold due to the snowfall. The number of frozen corpses on the roads suddenly increased again, causing the vehicles of the Pushan Villa and the Tongren Fuyuan Hall to be dispatched frequently. According to the observatory, there was also heavy snowfall in the Yangtze River Basin yesterday morning.

### Year-End Gift Certificates for Troop Morale and Disaster Relief Gain Momentum

Since the National Comforting Troops Association advocated for year-end gifts to boost troop morale and redirect gift-giving, all sectors of this city have been actively promoting it since the Shanghai War Memorial Day. Various industry associations and individuals have spontaneously participated with great enthusiasm. National banks have been receiving these donations in large numbers in recent days. Various circles are also taking the lead in saving on year-end gifts and donating to disaster relief, considering the end of the lunar year, the severe cold weather, and the suffering of disaster victims. This demonstrates the widespread patriotism and mutual assistance among the people of Shanghai.

The Fundraising Committee of the Citizens' Group of the Refugee Relief Association, in order to appeal to all sectors to save on year-end gifts and New Year's Eve dinner expenses and donate to disaster victims, has issued a notice to all citizens. Donations should be sent to the Association at the 4th floor of the Xingye Building on Jiangxi Road, or call 18533, and staff will be dispatched to collect them. In addition, the Association's sponsorship program for refugees allows individuals to sponsor one refugee per month by saving four yuan. The Association will present a letter of thanks and a sponsorship certificate jointly signed by Chairman Yu Qiaqing and others. With the certificate, sponsors can visit the refugees they sponsor at any time.

### Goods Arriving in Ningbo from Shanghai Released Early; Ningbo Customs Permits Flexible Handling

The Ningbo Chamber of Commerce telegraphed Chairman Huang of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, requesting him to instruct the Shipping Administration to expedite the inspection and release of imported goods. The original text reads, "(Greetings omitted) Imported goods are piled up like mountains at the customs, and the resources of the rear are all dependent on this. Merchants are unable to pick up goods as soon as they arrive due to customs regulations and time constraints, causing great distress. With the Lunar New Year approaching, the city's finances urgently need to be settled. If special conveniences are not provided in the shortest possible time, it will inevitably affect the market and become uncontrollable. In addition to urging the customs commissioner to handle it quickly, we earnestly request you to telegraph the Shipping Administration to expedite the inspection and release of imported goods, so as to alleviate the difficulties of merchants and maintain financial stability. We anxiously await your command. Respectfully, Zhou Dalie, Chairman of the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce." Furthermore, the Ningbo Customs Brokers Association, considering that the Lunar New Year is approaching and the situation in eastern Zhejiang is tense, and that the number of incoming goods from Shanghai waiting to be inspected and released is quite large, specifically requested relief from the Zhejiang Customs Commissioner. Commissioner An invited representatives from the customs brokers and shipping industries yesterday morning to discuss appropriate solutions. Cai Shizhang and Zhang Henian represented the customs brokers, while Zhou Dalie, Chen Renwei, Tu Ciqing, and Sheng Ruichang represented the shipping industry. Chairman Cai of the Customs Brokers Association requested the Commissioner to facilitate the extraction of goods already inspected or taxed at the Jianghai Customs to alleviate the merchants' difficulties. Commissioner An agreed to handle it flexibly within the possible scope. All representatives were satisfied and dispersed.

### Civil Food Regulation Association Orders Third Batch of Foreign Rice; Second Batch of 10,000 Bags to Arrive Soon; Price Stabilization Committee to Temporarily Suspend Sales from the 5th

Since the Shanghai Civil Food Regulation Association began registering procedures for ordering foreign rice at the end of last year, trade associations, companies, firms and shops have been requesting application forms from the association on Hong Kong Road in an endless stream. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency learned yesterday that the number of registered orders for No. 2 Saigon rice totaled more than 20,000 bags, with more than 400,000 silver dollars already paid as deposits and a total value of more than 1 million silver dollars.

The Association's communications office is still located at No. 59 Hong Kong Road, 3rd floor, Room 304. All accounting matters are handled gratuitously by the Gongxin Accounting Firm, and document matters are handled gratuitously by the Lixin Law Firm. The ordering of foreign rice is presided over by the Purchasing Committee, consisting of Yu Qiaqing, Guo Shunfu, and Gui Yanfang. However, various sectors fear that rice prices will continue to rise, and registrations have been very enthusiastic in recent days.

To Temporarily Suspend Price Stabilization Sales from the 5th

After the Price Stabilization Committee actively raised funds for price stabilization and continued to carry out price stabilization sales, the spot goods purchased from the market and the ordered Saigon broken rice, totaling 35,068 bags, are about to be sold out. As for the second batch of spot goods purchased, there are 5,000 bags, and the ordered rice is 11,000 bags, which will arrive in Shanghai soon. Since the rice shops entrusted by the committee are rushing to complete the finalization of affairs, it has been decided to temporarily suspend price stabilization sales from the 5th. Therefore, there has been a great rush to purchase rice at stabilized prices in recent days. Price stabilization sales will resume after the finalization period.

### Rickshaw Merchants Accuse Union Chairman of Embezzlement; Civil Lawsuit Partially Settled and Allowed to be Dismissed; Private Prosecution Ordered to Submit Accounts for Review

Yong Lichun, Li Bingyi, Li Dongrong, Liang Hengnian, Gu Huiwen, Zhang Yushan, Ma Riqi, Chen Hengquan, Wang Wen, Zhang Jiafu, Sun Shoujiang, Zhou Lidi, Cao Jiesan, Wang Hengzuo, and 56 other representatives of the Shanghai Rickshaw Association in the French Concession's Anna Road Jin Yu Li, recently engaged Wang Bingjun as their lawyer to file a private prosecution in the Criminal Division of the Special Second Court, citing Article 336 and 342 of the Criminal Law for

Embezzlement and Breach of Trust

against Qiu Chunshan, Standing Committee member and Chairman of the Association, Zhou Jinyuan, Standing Committee member, and Qin Jianzhou, and filed a civil lawsuit attached, demanding the return of a security deposit of 2,250 yuan. The complaint stated that the plaintiffs had paid a security fee of 2,250 yuan due to the municipality's implementation of rickshaw security. Later, since there was no need for security, the municipal government issued a notice of return. Therefore, they submitted a request for collection. They then received an official response from the Finance Bureau on April 10, 26th year, No. 633, stating, "Your submission is noted. The security deposit has already been announced by this bureau

for return

You may proceed to the Rickshaw Association to collect it. This response." The plaintiffs inquired from the defendants, who were vague and could not get a clear answer. The plaintiffs then submitted a request to the Municipal Public Works Bureau for clarification. The Bureau was surprised that the refund had been made a long time ago, and issued instruction No. 3905 on August 6, 26th year, stating that the security deposit had long been returned. Now, this instruction requires all rickshaw owners to be fully refunded within two days of its receipt, or else

severe punishment will be imposed

The plaintiffs, upon learning of this, negotiated with the Association, but the August 13th Incident occurred, leading to postponement. They only gathered rickshaw owners again between September and October of the previous year to negotiate with the Association, but still received no satisfactory response. It was only before April that they learned that the security deposit had been collected from the Bureau by the defendants in the name of the Association, and that they had taken advantage of the August 13th Incident to collude and divide the money, filling their own pockets. Therefore, they specifically requested the Court to investigate and prosecute the defendants for the crimes they deserve. The Court accepted the complaint, and Judge Chen Minsheng opened a criminal

second court to try the case

The plaintiffs, represented by their lawyer, appeared in court to state the intention to prosecute. For the incidental civil lawsuit, the two parties had reached a settlement and requested permission to withdraw. The three defendants all personally appeared in court and engaged Shi Lin, Zhang Shiying and other lawyers to defend them. According to the confession, the security deposit has indeed been received by the Association and has been fully used to purchase national salvation bonds, with no embezzlement or breach of trust whatsoever. The court ordered a change of date after the hearing, as further investigation was needed. At the next hearing, the defendants must submit the Association's accounts for review.

### Yang Ge Arrest Incident, News from This Port, United States Did Not Protest to Japan, No U.S. Embassy Representative Accompanied Yang into Prison

According to the Da Lu Bao, it is heard from private sources in this city that regarding the arrest of Yang Ge, a reporter for the American International News Service, in Tokyo on January 21, the United States has not yet lodged a formal protest with the Japanese government. The initial rumor from Tokyo that a representative from the American Embassy was imprisoned with Yang Ge has been found to be inaccurate. It is reported that a secretary from the embassy did accompany Yang Ge into the prison, but left a few minutes later because it was of no help. A Washington dispatch from the International News Service on January 23 stated that U.S. Secretary of State Hull had cabled U.S. Ambassador to Japan Grew to rescue Yang Ge. According to private sources, the Japanese government has not formally accused Yang Ge of any crime. However, the Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun claimed that Yang Ge "fabricated rumors and stirred up trouble," and said that Yang Ge would be sentenced to a minor punishment, and then he would be required to leave Japan before being released.

### Western Police Officer Killed by Mistake, Police Department Will Not Prosecute, Shen Zhi Jing and Bao Pei De Granted Release

A worker in the furnace room of the Postal Administration on North Suzhou Road and a worker from the Far East Cleaning Company had a dispute over boiling water. At noon on January 10, Bao Pei De, the Ningbo manager of the cleaning company, went to question the head of the furnace room of the administration about the reason for not allowing them to take hot water. He was surrounded by the workers. In desperation, Bao fired his own pistol into the ground as a warning shot, which caused Western police officer 克蘭克 (Krank) who was patrolling outside, and Chinese police officer Shen Zhi Jing from Hebei (number 1289), to enter the building to investigate. At that time, the Chinese police officer observed that Bao Pei De had one hand in his coat pocket, appearing as if he was reaching for a gun, and fearing that he would open fire and resist arrest, Shen Zhi Jing drew his gun and aimed at Bao's right arm to shoot. The bullet mistakenly hit Western police officer 克蘭克 (Krank)'s abdomen, killing him. Bao and Shen were escorted to the First Special District Court and requested to be detained. Shen, the Chinese police officer, was later released on bail. The case was originally scheduled for another hearing on the 7th of this month. Now, the police department has decided that Bao and Shen were not related to the bullet wound and death of Western police officer 克蘭克 (Krank), so yesterday they submitted the case file to the Third Criminal Court. The police department's lawyer Qian Xun Jiu narrated the events and requested the withdrawal of the detention. Judge Jiang Shu granted Bao Pei De and Shen Zhi Jing's release without prosecution by the police department, and approved the withdrawal of the detention.

### Finance: HSBC and Hong Kong Provide Supply, Foreign Exchange Gradually Stabilizes

Yesterday's foreign exchange market: HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged. The unofficial market for British and American exchange rates was slightly stable, and the style also changed. Although it was once again unsustainable in the early morning, hitting new lows for the year at 4 pence 4.0625 and 7.3125 yuan, the trend seemed to have turned around slightly based on the closing results of the day. The reason was that Hong Kong telegraphic transfers were constantly supplied, and a considerable amount was profitably sold, so in the end, each saw a rebound of 0.03125. As for the process of the day, the morning opened weak, especially with the US exchange rate being affected by the sharp contraction of 2.375 points in the US-British exchange rate, so the tight situation was even more severe. The British exchange rate contracted by 0.015625, and the US exchange rate weakened by 0.0625, to 4 pence 4.375 and 7.34375 yuan. At the opening, Hong Kong telegraphic transfers flooded in, but HSBC's appetite was particularly strong. It was said that it had even bought 100,000 taels of cash, and there were continued benefits to be gained from the purchasing. Therefore, the rebound at that time was minimal. At that time, it was reported as 4 pence 4.53125 and 7.375 yuan. Later, Sassoon and importers suddenly came to compete for purchases, so the situation tightened again, once reaching 4 pence 4.0625 and 7.3125 yuan. Fortunately, HSBC changed its mind and provided supply, and Hong Kong telegraphic transfers came to maintain the market, coupled with sales from Chinese banks and speculators, so it finally rebounded to 4 pence 4.6875 and 7.40625 yuan. The situation turned flat at noon. Until the close at noon, the British exchange rate was still 4 pence 4.6875, and the US exchange rate was 7.375 yuan. In the early afternoon, it was slightly tight, but Hong Kong telegraphic transfers were supplied again, and Chinese merchants continued to close out positions, so until the evening close, it hardened to 4 pence 4.84375 and 7.4375 yuan.

After opening, although Hong Kong telegraphic transfers came with a strong supply, HSBC was strong in terms of appetite, so the rebound at that time was extremely minimal. At 9:30 AM, it had rebounded to 4 pence 4.53125 and 7.375 yuan. HSBC's listed prices were announced unchanged, and the silver balancing tax was announced to be two points higher. After this, the selling wind of Hong Kong telegraphic transfers subsided, and Sassoon and major foreign firms came to compete for purchases, so market prices tightened again. Soon, it tightened to 4 pence 4.0625 and 7.3125 yuan, and the upper price was once difficult to purchase. Then, HSBC changed its mind and provided supply, once supplying importers with US exchange rates for the current month at 7.25 yuan, and Hong Kong telegraphic transfers came to release supply again, relying on Chinese banks and speculators frequently coming to profit and close out positions, and buyers had slightly restrained themselves, so the situation rebounded. Around 11:30 AM, it had reached 4 pence 4.6875 and 7.40625 yuan. Transactions decreased at noon, and the situation gradually flattened. Until the close at noon, the British exchange rate was still 4 pence 4.6875, and the US exchange rate was 7.375 yuan, each rebounding by 0.03125 compared to the morning opening.

A money exchange firm sold 30 taels to a stock exchange brokerage for 4,250 yuan. Later, as the foreign exchange rate tightened again, the buying wind rose again, and money exchange firms and certain silver firms scrambled to buy, and retail investors followed suit. Although silver dealers still had supply coming out, it was eventually pushed up to 4,300 yuan. Then, as foreign exchange rates rebounded, people's minds turned, and a certain gold dealer was the first to switch from buying to selling, and money exchange firms and cash gold dealers also sold to each other. The price then slowly fell back, dropping 60 yuan. A gold dealer sold 20 taels to a silver dealer for 4,240 yuan.

### Discount Rate Fell Back by Two Yuan

Yesterday, the discount rate for bills of exchange slightly fell back. The price per thousand yuan initially rose to 38.5 yuan in the morning, and then fell back to 34 yuan in the afternoon. The result was a decrease of 2 yuan compared to the previous day. The Shanghai Money Industry Association's call loan rate remained unchanged at 0.10 yuan in the morning and afternoon markets.

### Large Commodity Futures Rose and Indian Silver Fell Back

London, 1st: London silver market continued to see an increase, with the near-term increasing by 3.75, and the long-term increasing by 3.125. Few speculators bought in, and the supply was limited. Transactions were very light. The market was stable after the close. New York: American silver prices remained flat. Bombay: Indian silver spot prices fell by 6 annas, and futures prices fell by 9 annas. The market was flat, with a total of 100 contracts traded.

### Bank Clearing House Revises Interest Rates

The Shanghai Banking Association Joint Clearing Committee issued a circular to all banks, effective from February 1st:

Revised interest rates are as follows: (Interest rate for public bond call loans: 0.28 yuan in national currency, 0.00 in exchange) (Discount rate for accepted bills of exchange with a maturity of 90 days): 0.28 yuan in national currency, 0.20 in exchange. (Interest rate for using interbank exchange) 0.17 yuan, (Overdue interest on interbank exchange call loans) 0.22 yuan. Each thousand yuan is calculated daily at the above interest rates. Compared with the changes on January 17th, except for the unchanged national currency interest rate, exchange rates have increased by 0.02 yuan. In addition, the association has set the interest on interbank exchange deposits for January at 4 yuan per thousand yuan. As for the seven-day exchange accounts from February 1st to February 7th, if interest needs to be settled, it will be calculated at 3.5 yuan per thousand yuan (equivalent to a monthly interest rate of 3.5%), which has also been notified to all banks for clearing.

### Securities: Public Debt Closing Transactions

Yesterday's over-the-counter securities market trended stable. All rumors could not be confirmed, but spot gold remained high, causing people to remain hesitant. Because of the upcoming New Year holiday, there were eight days of vacation, and many were afraid of losing interest, and did not dare to take much action. Because it was not easy to borrow during the New Year, the shorts could not pressure the market. There were many closing transactions and some short covering. Today is the last day of the year, with only half-day trading in the morning. The initial opening yesterday morning was still gradually weakening. Class C once broke 7 yuan, but rebounded due to short covering. In the afternoon, because the expiration date was approaching, scattered short covering and a small number of long positions were still lively, and the market price strengthened again. Class A reached 9 yuan. As a result, only Class C continued to decrease by 0.1 yuan, while Class B returned by 0.1 to 0.3 yuan. The total transaction volume was about 700,000 yuan. A simplified table is listed below:

Category　Highest　Lowest　Closing　Compared to Previous Day

Unified A　59.00　58.28　59.00　Up 0.30

Unified B　49.80　49.30　49.80　Flat

Unified C　47.70　46.80　47.60　Down 0.10

Unified D　47.00　——　47.00　Up 0.10

Unified E　47.40　46.95　47.40　Up 0.15

Stock trading: 30 shares of Guohua Bank were traded at a price of 60 yuan.

London, 1st: Today's listed market for Chinese foreign debt remained stable for all bonds.

London, 1st: Today's listed market for British-owned Far East companies' stocks was generally stable, with limited increases and decreases. Shanghai Waterworks A shares rose sharply by £2.5 to £14.5. Commercial Union Assurance shares fell back by 5 shillings, but remained at £26.5. All others had no gains or losses.

### Food: Flour Inventory Not Small, Factories Hoard and Do Not Release: Waiting for Good Prices

Flour: Yesterday's spot flour market: As the end of the year approached, both buyers and sellers were closing out positions. Buyers no longer had a formal appetite, and factories restricted supply to the market, so even if people wanted to buy, there was no flour available. Even those with call-back orders held onto them and did not release them. Therefore, the transaction volume was only 1,000 to 2,000 bags. The local wholesale transactions were also less than 5,000 bags. However, in the market at high prices, people still wanted to be optimistic. Although factory prices have not increased, there are fears that the New Year's rebound will be shocking. According to the Shanghai flour inventory, Chinese factories have about 1 million bags, and Japanese factories have 550,000 bags, which is not a small number. However, they are being manipulated, hoarding them and not releasing them. This is creating a serious situation, which is unfortunate for the people. Currently, the retail price of Lao Che Pai flour is 10.6 yuan per bag. If you want to sell one or two bags, it is feared that the price will not be available for purchase next year.

Wheat: The market situation yesterday was already in a closing state. The market was hoarding goods, intending to abide by the red market and sell at a good price. Other miscellaneous grains were also sealed and rarely released. The domestic wheat inventory is about 45,000 bags, and the foreign wheat inventory is about 70,000 bags, which is significantly reduced compared to previous years. Recently, foreign exchange rates have frequently contracted, and the combined price of foreign wheat is not profitable, so it is difficult for the market to fall back.

### Heavy Snow, Rice Market Still Expensive

Yesterday, heavy snow fell, and all sources of supply were cut off. The market was already in a closing state. In general, buyers and sellers were closing their accounts, so few goods were displayed. Only call-back goods were slightly traded. The market situation was quite firm, and the prices were quite high. Customers and shopkeepers had already prepared enough in the previous few days, and did not need to buy more. During this short period of time, those who are still seeking to purchase are nothing more than those who need to buy urgently and those small rice shops with weak capital. For this reason, the city's transactions are limited to only 2,000 to 3,000 bags. The price of each type of goods has increased by as much as 1 yuan. Most of the sales are foreign rice. Only early and late rice are still priced at 40 yuan, slightly opening. High-quality white rice is priced at 41 yuan, followed by 39 yuan, and Yin rice at 40 yuan. Foreign rice: No. 1 Saigon closed at 42.6 yuan to 42.4 yuan, No. 2 at 41.5 yuan, 41.4 yuan, Huo Jiao at 41.7 yuan, 41.5 yuan, Da Jiao highest from 39 yuan, followed by 38 yuan, Tokyo Jian at 39 yuan, broken rice at 33 yuan, No. 1 Saigon broken rice at 35.5 yuan.

Foreign rice: Yesterday, due to the contraction of foreign exchange rates and the increase in gold prices, speculation was particularly active. There was also a little activity in the mainland within the city. In addition, because the inventory of domestic rice was scarce, both customer and shopkeepers focused on foreign rice. Also, because foreign rice was not subject to price limits, speculators were able to do whatever they wanted. No. 1 Saigon rose to 42.5 yuan, and No. 2 also rose to 41.3 yuan. Extra-high-quality rice was priced at 43 yuan, a price increase of 1 yuan compared to the previous market. Even broken rice reached 33.7 yuan. It is heard that two to three thousand tons of new transactions were recently concluded abroad, with prices ranging from 50.08 yuan to 51.2 yuan.

### Wuxi Rice Mills Supply Japanese Rice, 10,000 Shi in Three Days, Market Prices Firm and Expensive

Wuxi rice market: In previous years, the rice industry traded until the 24th day of the twelfth lunar month ( 送灶日 - the day to send off the Kitchen God). After the war, the precedent was broken, and business was conducted as usual until both the minor and major New Year's Eves. This year was slightly earlier than last year, and the major closing has already been handled. Although there has been heavy rain in recent days, the rice market has not weakened. This year, merchants from all over have been transporting goods, with plentiful profits, so rice boats have been arriving one after another, and the supply has been unexpectedly abundant. Traders and non-industry hoarders have been buying every day, and retail sales of brown rice and Japonica rice have also increased sharply to prepare for the New Year market. In addition, there has been the intimidation by Japanese companies and officials. They have been purchasing large quantities of rice for meals every day, causing the price of rice to rise without falling. High-quality Japonica rice (158 市斤 - catty) has reached 25.3 yuan, and retail Japonica rice must be 24.8 or 9 yuan. Japonica rice is 12.5 yuan per dan. In the past two days, rice has skyrocketed by 1 yuan, and rice has risen by 0.5 to 0.6 yuan.

The reason is that since the Rice Milling Association contracted to supply 10,000 shi of Japanese polished Japonica rice to the Japanese, it has been allocated to the mills according to the rice milling machines, and they have been limited to clearing the goods in full within three days. Therefore, the mills that accepted this transaction have been rushing to mill every day, focusing on clearing the goods. The number of polished Japonica rice on the market has suddenly dried up, and the sample packages of polished rice on the market have become rare. Supply has not been meeting demand, creating an unexpected surge. Otherwise, judging from the current inventory, it should have fallen back. This is truly unfortunate for the common people. In general, rice merchants are only concerned with great profits and do not care about the people's food. Good people sigh. Because of the sparse inventory of flour, flour shops are buying and selling futures, causing speculation from outside the industry. This year, the price of flour has risen from 4-5 yuan per bag to 11-12 yuan per bag, and speculators have made huge profits. Common laborers and poor people who live on flour have been complaining bitterly.

### Trust Shares Set New Records

Yesterday, the stock market at the Public Industry Exchange was as strong as ever, even though the holidays had arrived. The transaction volume did not decrease slightly. In fact, the enthusiasm of the public has increased, recognizing that after the currency's value has declined or will further decline, the soaring of stocks will be even greater than today. Rubber shares remained firm in off-hours trading, but receded due to profit-taking. At the close, buying sentiment was very good, with the price only a fraction of a difference from the highest of the day. Industrial shares were also very prosperous, and the share prices of each trust company all set new records.

### Cotton Yarn: Cotton Yarn Market and Foreign Exchange, Following Each Other Closely, "Double Horse" Brand Hits a High of 775 Yuan

The cotton yarn market is experiencing an unusually strong rise, while the foreign exchange market is seeing renewed contraction. This has led to an influx of speculators, boosting morale and driving the market upwards step by step. However, some traders, having seen ten consecutive days of increases, with prices already 60 to 70 yuan higher than the lowest point, are taking profits, hoping to have a profitable new year. As a result, the market turned downward at the close, falling back eight yuan. Nevertheless, inventories remain substantial.

The morning cotton yarn market opened higher, fueled by a significant contraction in the afternoon foreign exchange market the previous day. This boosted morale, and bullish traders aggressively pushed prices up. As a result, the market jumped wildly by fifteen yuan. The price for 20-count "Double Horse" yarn opened at 770 yuan, immediately rising to 775 yuan, due to the further tightening of foreign exchange. However, in an instant, rumors of an easing in foreign exchange emerged, triggering a selling frenzy, and bullish traders rushed to take profits, causing a drop of eight yuan. 20-count "Double Horse" yarn closed at 767 yuan. According to half-day trading statistics, 1,750 bales were traded, with the price of 20-count "Double Horse" yarn rising by 10.05 yuan. The amounts purchased by each group are listed below: Fellow Traders: 1,310; Hong Kong: 440; Total: 1,750

### Trading Silent and Still: Cotton Merchants Prepare for the New Year

Cotton trading remains suspended. All firms have settled their accounts and have no intention of continuing business, anticipating the arrival of wealth from all directions. Therefore, business is quiet, but morale remains high. Supplies from northern Jiangsu have also ceased.

In other news, regarding foreign cotton prices, the New York market initially rose by four to five pounds due to favorable news from Liverpool. Later, due to purchases by overseas merchants and short covering, the closing price was more than ten pounds higher for near-term contracts and four to five pounds higher for longer-term contracts compared to the previous day. Indian cotton futures were up three rupees compared to yesterday, Egyptian cotton was up over twenty pounds, and Liverpool cotton was up over ten pence.

The Shanghai foreign cotton market has been quiet due to the approaching Lunar New Year and the tightening of foreign exchange, which has significantly increased cotton prices when converted. Consequently, trading among fellow merchants is quiet. Factories are also facing the end of the year and have no intention of purchasing raw cotton. This is also the case for Japanese manufacturers. The delivered prices to factories yesterday, based on an exchange rate of 7.375 yuan to the US dollar, are as follows:

20-count "American Excellent" : 237.9

Also, F Grade: 235.40

32-count "American Excellent": 246.60

Also, F Grade: 244.10

32-count "American Excellent": 149.40

Also, F Grade: 246.00

### The Crime of Poverty

— Huang Jiayin

Previously, we discussed how a Mr. Wang used his twelve-year-old twin sons to file lawsuits and beg for money, resulting in his arrest by the police for fraud. We also discussed the crime of "harming his children," considering Mr. Wang to be "deserving of his punishment."

This is, of course, from a social responsibility perspective. Now, let's look at it from Mr. Wang's personal circumstances and viewpoint.

According to our investigation, Mr. Wang has three or four other children besides the twins, all in dire need of food. Since August 13th, he has been unemployed, sometimes making a living by fortune-telling. Recently, his wife fell ill, leaving him with no other choice but to resort to "this last resort" of sending his two sons to file lawsuits.

Mr. Wang has committed a crime, whether it's fraud or "harming his children." In short, it can be called "the crime of poverty." We believe that criminals in society can be divided into two categories: those who "willingly descend into depravity" and those who are "forced to do so." The former are not pressured by life but enticed by the environment; the latter are purely driven by the lash of life, the so-called crime of poverty.

It is said that Mr. Wang has been sentenced to thirty days of imprisonment. We don't want to say much about this. However, as far as we know, apart from the court imposing this punishment on Mr. Wang, no one else has considered any solutions for his future life. We imagine that after Mr. Wang leaves prison and spends the "New Year" there, he will surely shake his head and sigh sadly in front of his wife's sickbed, feeling dejected because their lives remain as hopeless as before, or perhaps even more hopeless.

Education

### University Life - Half a Year

— Bai Hehua

Young people inevitably have dreams, with beautiful images floating in their minds. Holding a diploma, I stepped out of the school gate; with a dream, I stepped into the university gate; but after sitting in the lecture hall for half a year, my dream has long been shattered.

What remains in my heart now is complaint.

There are simply too many people in our society who adhere to old ways. The basis for doing things is "convention," and deviations are not allowed. This was the case in our grandfather's era, our father's era, and it is still the case in our era. I hope that our son's era will no longer be like this. That is the so-called "dignity of the teacher." The "correct" interpretation is that the professor's words are the truth.

Our university is like a monastery. There is no sunlight; there is murky air, arbitrariness and blind obedience. Freedom has been killed by a strong hand.

I don't think the university is a place for manufacturing living bookshelves. But in fact, this is what has happened. The professor's grand theories are copied into the students' notebooks and then transferred onto the exam papers. In the end, that pile of notes is sealed in a dead bookshelf.

Understanding is built on the foundation of thinking, and truth is the crystallization of multi-faceted research. It is a fact that professors are more knowledgeable than students, but they should not be arbitrary; their responsibility is to point the way, not to preach. The student's task is to compare, research, and then draw a conclusion; not to blindly follow. But our university lacks this good atmosphere.

Public opinion regarding university students is not very flattering—at least for Shanghai university students, who are thought to only know how to watch movies, go to dance halls, and fall in love. And our satirists' "school scenery" is also like this. But what is the reason? Critics do not talk about it, perhaps they simply do not want to talk about it?

Frankly, this is precisely a link in the chain of defects in the entire social system. Society is full of traps, and people fall into them. Is it fair for public opinion to one-sidedly blame people?

After studying at university for half a year, I understood why university students "don't like" studying. Can an older, taller person be content with the situation of a duck being force-fed? If anyone answers in the affirmative, I think they will not amount to much.

But, friends! Whether you have already stepped into this gate or are about to step into it, we must try to use our own strength to cultivate a new atmosphere.

"Save the primary school students," someone shouts; "Save the middle school students," someone else shouts; but, is it also permissible for us to shout here: "Save the university students"? We want freedom to research.

Essay

### Snow

— Zeng Dao

I love snow, and I love the snowscape after it snows even more, because it symbolizes the coming of light; when snow is all around, it is so bright!

The arrival of snow makes everyone excited. Children jump and shout in the snow, showing their true vitality; adults, although they may not go out to jump in the snow themselves, are so envious when they see the children in the snow! They smile and recall their own childhood.

Enviable snow! It has also come to us this winter, for a full day and a half, giving us so much excitement. Watching the falling snow, watching the children jumping in the snow, I smiled knowingly.

I looked ahead, at the snow piled on the tiled roofs. The snow of my hometown swirled in my mind: leaning against the window, watching the snow fall, onto the low houses, onto the ground, onto the branches. This snow! Dazzled my eyes, it covered up the scorched earth, restoring the beauty of the withered grassland to when it had green leaves; the black tiled roofs changed their appearance; the bare trees were covered with a garment; this snow! Froze the pests in the fields to death, allowing us to have a good harvest in the coming year; in my hometown, the little birds flew aimlessly in the snow, but who among us snow lovers cared about them.

But now, looking at the pile of snow on the corner of the roof, I sighed: The snow of my hometown: It has been far away from me for a long time. —But I will never forget it.

A few hours after the snow stopped, the snow, the first snow of this year, was gone. Couldn't it have lingered a little longer?

However, in the howling north wind, I found a person shivering in the wind, helplessly adrift. Just a few hours ago, they were being drenched by the snow, weren't they? But among us snow lovers, seeing those with the same fate as the little birds aimlessly adrift in the snow, who would care about them?

### Visiting the Duchess of Windsor

— Hua Zhi

The Duchess of Windsor is truly a woman of the era. No wonder the abdicated King Windsor admires her so much. In Paris, no woman active in society is more courageous and capable than her.

Recently, a reporter went to see her. She talked about the six or seven air raid alarms in Paris recently, and she did not hide in the cellar once. She was unwilling to be threatened by the Nazis' planes and flee to the basement like a refugee. She said, "Once you encounter war, it is best to take your chances. Being killed by a bomb is like being run over by a car. Even a careful driver cannot avoid it. It is almost preordained by heaven, both inconceivable and beyond our control."

Truly, I have never seen anyone hate war so thoroughly as she does. War, to an American like her, was originally very unfamiliar and seemed to require no responsibility. However, this capable woman poured her entire spirit and determination into the war effort. Her face showed an eager joy, and she carried a capable expression, just like three years ago when she was "Mrs. Simpson" and sought a victory in the world of love.

The Duchess of Windsor is currently the honorary vice-president of the "Versailles Military Supplies Packaging Company." Not long ago, she guided the staff in packing six thousand sets of wool underwear and sent them to French soldiers fighting on the northeastern front. The only condition for her joining these groups is: she does not want to be just a figurehead, there must be work to do, otherwise she will not do it. One of her service partners, when mentioning the Duchess's service spirit, said: "She is like acting in a play, she is the center of the whole play, and it is vivid and colorful. In the various French efforts engaged in rescue, relief, and comforting camps, she is one of the most capable people. She is a meticulous practitioner and organizer."

In addition to collecting winter clothing, she also advocated knitting wool socks for soldiers. Not only do the soldiers benefit, but artists are also comforted. After the outbreak of war in Paris, some unemployed actors and artists were too poor to support themselves. Someone founded an "Economic Restaurant" to provide them with cheap meals at two francs per meal. She is one of the sponsors and fundraisers.

At the Duchess's residence in the Sack District, the door is now open and closed all day, and the windows are covered with thick black curtains. Most of her servants have gone to war, and I only saw a thin gatekeeper. Her other residence has been used as a hospital for the British Expeditionary Force, and she has gathered a doctor and six nurses to take care of it.

When talking to the Duchess about the Duke, she laughed and said that their opinions had once differed. Their original plan was to travel to the United States and Canada in March of this year, and she also wanted to return to her hometown of Baltimore. But the war caused their plan to fail. When Windsor was appointed as a Colonel in the British Army, he hoped that his wife would return home to avoid possible air raids in Paris. The Duchess was unwilling to appear cowardly, so she resolutely stayed in Paris. The final agreement was that the Duke would return home alone, and whenever he had the opportunity to tour the French battlefield, he would come to Paris to see her.

### Love

— Zhong Kang

"Only love can conquer the world. All the monarchs who dreamed of building world empires have failed one by one; the first emperors of China, Alexander, Hannibal, Caesar, and Napoleon, all their achievements have failed and vanished like illusions. Conquest by force is of no effect. At most, it is only temporary and ends in a moment.

"I oppose all learning, organizations, governments, arts, and religions that reject love; I oppose any church that claims faith but does not adhere to love; I oppose even more all politicians who rely on force and do not know what love is. If I am arrested for saying this, then put the shackles on me, because I would rather die quickly under the knife than die of thirst in the waterless Sahara." —Words of Toyohiko Kagawa, a Japanese commoner leader.

(Decorating Liu Bei), Yang Xiaolou (Zhao Yun), Ma Lianliang (Qiao Xuan), Jin Shaoshan (Sun Quan), Gong Yunfu (Empress Dowager), Mei Lanfang (Sun Shangxiang), Tan Fuying (Lu Su), Jiang Miaoxiang (Zhou Yu), performing the complete "Returning to Jingzhou," were all masterpieces of their time. Also, seen occasionally in theaters and at private performances, Wang Yaoqing, Shang Xiaoyun, Zhu Suyun's "Nengren Temple," Yang Xiaolou, Yan Jupeng's "Eight Gates Golden Lock Formation," Yu Shuyan, Cheng Yanqiu's "Fishing and Killing the Family," Wang Changlin, Qian Jinfu's "Xiangmei Temple," were all top selections. Recently, the only performances seen were Zhang Eryun, Ye Shengian, Furongcao's "Satisfactory Marriage," which was reasonably well-matched. Zheng Bingru's "Yutangchun" has an extremely clear voice and excellent timing, but pairing it with Zhang Lianchang's Wang Jinlong ruins the experience. Also, listening to Zheng's "Great Protecting Kingdom, Second Visit to the Palace" is particularly unbearable, as the keys of Zheng, Guan Dayuan, and Jin Shaochen are different, and Zheng's singing is particularly unsuitable for this type of Zheng Gong Qing Yi play. Wang Yurong, Yang Baosen, and Qiu Shengrong performing this are slightly more suitable, but having seen the best, it is difficult to be satisfied. Having heard Shang Xiaoyun, Tan Xiaopei, and Jin Shaoshan sing "Second Visit to the Palace" together is barely satisfactory.

### New Films in Various Cinemas During the Spring Festival

— Lu Di

The New Year has just passed, and the Spring Festival is approaching. Most people have three or four days of vacation, so each cinema is showing the best films to provide people with entertainment. I will list the new films being shown in various cinemas, as far as I know:

Dahua is showing "Tarzan Finds a Son" starring Weissmuller, another Tarzan film; Daguangming is showing "The Rains Came" starring Tyrone Power, George Brent, and others; Guotai is showing "All This, and Heaven Too" starring Elfriede Lombard, Bette Davis, and others; Nanjing is showing "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" starring the great artist Charles Laughton; and Da Shanghai is showing "The Return of the Monster" starring Humphrey Bogart.

The films in the Three Kingdoms Cinema are: Huguang has Chen Yunshang's fifth work "Qin Liangyu"; Jincheng has Zhou Xuan starring in "Dong Xiaowan"; and Xinguang is showing the two-part "Wen Suchen".

As for the four-house circuit cinemas, because the films currently in circulation are not particularly outstanding, they will specially change to show other films for two weeks from Sunday, and then resume showing the films currently being shown. I will list the films being changed on Sunday: Jinmen will show "Dedication to the Motherland" from Sunday to Monday, "Mandarin Duck First Call" from Tuesday to Wednesday, and "Eternity" from Thursday to Saturday; Lido will show "Little Wild Goose", "Heroes of Hell", and "Record of Bloody Battles of the Lost Battalion"; Paris will show "Black Sea Monster", "White-Clad Ambassador", and "Jewelry Treasure"; Guanglu will show "New Four Daughters", "Robin Hood", and "Searching for a Teacher Thousands of Miles Away", etc.

Furthermore, the film "Magnificent Rivers and Mountains" was originally intended to be released, but due to the special circumstances that the Jinmen and Paris cinemas are located in the French Concession, it could not be realized. Therefore, it is regrettable that this film cannot be shown in the two cinemas.

### Recent News About "Confucius"

— Yun

The Minhua film "Confucius" is now more than halfway completed. Li Jingbo, Ge Xin, Wu Jingping, and Tang Qi, who previously starred in "Orphan Island Paradise" in Hong Kong, have recently joined the cast of "Confucius". The entire production is being accelerated.

Musician Lin Shengshi has been hired to serve as the sound effects director for "Confucius", and ancient musicians and orchestras will participate in the accompaniment. Tang Huaiqiu and Zhang Yi will sing a pure Chinese-style ancient song in the film.

It takes seven or eight hours for Tang Huaiqiu to put on makeup for "Confucius". Tang said that each makeup session is like taking a train from Beijing to Shanghai. The only difficult point is that when the real flesh underneath the fake flesh on his face itches, he cannot scratch or massage it, and can only let it itch and stop on its own, which is the most helpless thing.

In order to carefully handle his work, Fei Mu intends to delay the completion of "Confucius" until the end of February. It takes half a year to produce a film, which is unprecedented in post-war orphan island cinema.

### Unofficial History of the Pear Garden: The Golden Voice is Ruined (Part 2)

Everyone knows that Shaoshan has a golden voice, and he is also named Jin. So, saying that he is a golden voice has a double meaning. He is a free and uninhibited person who spends money like water, and he is a rare eccentric in the Pear Garden world, past and present. His departure from Shanghai to return to Beijing last year did cause a stir. He went to Guanwai a few times and earned a lot of money. After returning to Beijing, he renovated his house along Panjiahe and bought a piece of land outside Yongdingmen to build a flower farm, hiring a gardener to plant seasonal flowers and plants. Every day when he has nothing to do, he takes a large group of cats, dogs, and monkeys to the flower farm to play, and incidentally practices his singing. He also built a thatched cottage in the flower farm, exquisitely furnished, and bought two small stoves to boil good tea. He casually picks vegetables from the garden to cook some small dishes to eat with wine. Moreover, he has prepared opium to lie down and smoke a few pipes. Shaoshan's fun is like that of a noble and elegant person. The style of the Banner people, the money he earned himself, he spends to his heart's content. This is what he sees through, and he is a hundred times better than the brains of ordinary money-grubbers. It is truly enviable. Who knew that he would meet two girls here who go there every day to practice singing, and later become wives from being apprentices. Both of them followed Shaoshan, with both smoking and beautiful women, even a famous golden voice could not be saved. Many old friends in Shanghai who care about Shaoshan were saddened to hear the news of his ruined voice. They hope that he will turn back quickly and restore the honor of the golden voice. I have always held the principle of urging actors to improve through punishment, especially for rare talents like Jin and Li, and I do not want to interfere too much and blame them. Therefore, I cannot bear to describe in detail the trivial details of Jin and the two women. (181)
