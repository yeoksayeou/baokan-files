Our troops fought bravely and fiercely. Furthermore, Allied forces continued to evacuate from Dunkirk port day and night yesterday under enemy aircraft bombing and artillery fire. As for the enemy forces on the Somme River line, they launched multiple small-scale offensives yesterday, all of which failed. In other areas, there was only artillery fire. (2nd Havas dispatch)

Paris - Responsible military figures stated that the enemy forces are unlikely to launch a large-scale offensive in the next few days.

(2nd Havas News Agency dispatch)

Paris - French military officials announced that British and French troops who lost contact with the main force retreating toward Dunkirk have now rejoined the Allied forces. The number of these troops is unknown. (2nd Reuters dispatch)

Paris - Military figures here stated that according to news from Dunkirk, although Allied forces are subjected to German aircraft bombing and artillery fire, they are still continuously withdrawing from the Flanders area. As for the vicinity of Dunkirk, it is almost completely flooded. In addition, the Allied forces are bravely resisting in the suburbs, making it difficult for the German forces to advance swiftly, allowing them only to bomb and shell with aircraft and artillery. Furthermore, several Belgian troops who refused to surrender have broken through the German lines and arrived in the Dunkirk area to join the Allied forces. A portion of the Allied forces are responsible for covering the retreat of the main force, and they continue to fight and retreat toward Dunkirk today. As for the German forces in the Abbeville area at the mouth of the Somme River, they launched multiple fierce attacks with the assistance of aircraft and tanks, but were repelled by the French forces. German forces also launched a surprise attack on the upper reaches of the Somme River, which also failed. (1st Havas dispatch)

Paris - General Headquarters announced a war bulletin tonight, stating, "Our troops resisted enemy attacks in the north of the country and effectively covered the continuous retreat of Allied forces. Apart from some activity along the Somme River, there is nothing else to report. Also, a squadron of our bombers flew to the north yesterday afternoon to bomb enemy concentration points, and then flew to the Meuse River, Moselle River, and Rhine River areas for reconnaissance. They also engaged in combat with enemy aircraft in the Rhone River valley, shooting down several enemy aircraft. The exact number is still being determined." (1st Havas dispatch)

London - As the last part of the British Expeditionary Force in Dunkirk fought fiercely today to cover the retreat of the remaining British and French troops in Flanders, resisting the German advance, the British side has also formed a combat force to cope with the war on another front. A large number of soldiers retreating from the north, after a 48-hour break, will be assigned to the newly formed expeditionary force to go to the battlefield under the command of Allied Commander-in-Chief General Weygand. It is generally believed that this new army may join part of the existing French forces jointly defending the Somme line. (2nd United Press dispatch)

German War Bulletin

German Führer Headquarters - Yesterday, German forces continued to advance towards Dunkirk along the coast on both sides. British troops resisted stubbornly, and the fighting was exceptionally fierce. Nieuport is in the hands of German forces. Attin-Couck State, west of Furnes, and Ghyvelde, ten kilometers east of Dunkirk, have been occupied by German forces. German forces captured a large amount of war materiel. One army captured 200 cannons of various types. There was no special development in the southern theater. German bombers carried out low-altitude attacks on troop transport ships in Dunkirk, sinking four warships and eleven transport ships (approximately 54,000 tons). Fourteen warships, including two cruisers, two light cruisers, one anti-aircraft cruiser, six destroyers, three torpedo boats, and thirty-eight merchant ships (approximately 160,000 tons), were also hit and severely damaged. Many other small boats capsized. The dense troops on the beaches of Dunkirk were also bombed by German aircraft. German torpedo boats also destroyed several sections of the British Marseille-Lyon railway. The Allied forces lost a total of 58 aircraft yesterday, of which 42 were shot down in air combat, 8 were shot down by anti-aircraft guns, and the rest were destroyed at the airfield. A total of 15 German aircraft are missing. On the Norwegian front, German forces advanced from Trondheim and have occupied Bodø, capturing a large amount of military supplies. (2nd Reuter dispatch)

Berlin - The German High Command announced last night that the remaining British Expeditionary Force troops attempted to escape to warships off Dunkirk in various vessels yesterday, but were bombed by the German Air Force, which sank 40,000 tons of transport ships and troop ships, as well as four other warships and fifteen merchant ships. In air combat, 40 enemy aircraft were shot down. (2nd Havas News Agency dispatch)

Berlin - According to military journalist Lenz, after German motorcycle units occupied a fortress near Bollezeele, they discovered several British destroyers approaching the coast. A soldier in the unit, a trained artilleryman, fired five shots and sank one destroyer. (2nd Havas News Agency dispatch)

Berlin - Military officials in Wilhelmstrasse announced last night that the first phase of Hitler's spring offensive has now been completed. Three elite army corps in northern France have been annihilated, and the remnants of the British Expeditionary Force have been routed. The British army lacks tanks and mechanized equipment, but a part is still trapped in Dunkirk and the large sand dunes extending to Nappol. The resistance of the northern French army no longer exists fundamentally. German authorities acknowledge that the British army, aided by heavy fog, has transported a considerable number of troops across the Channel, but they say that the British losses are extremely heavy. According to the German side, the British army has occupied positions near Dunkirk due to the flooding of the Bassée Canal, but German troops have already occupied a bridgehead of the canal and will soon be able to eliminate the last British resistance. (2nd United Press dispatch)

Heavy Fog Along the Channel - British Expeditionary Force Continues to Retreat

Paris - The French Air Ministry announced that despite heavy fog along the Channel coast, our aircraft were still carrying out missions over the Dunkirk area last night to supply land forces and brought back information about enemy artillery positions, especially to the north of the Bapaume-Amiens line and northeast of Abbeville. Yesterday, French bombers bombed enemy motorized units between Doullens and Abbeville. The airfield occupied by German forces was also bombed. (2nd Reuters dispatch)

Berlin - According to the German News Agency, a German military expert said that the British Expeditionary Force has had unexpected luck, because visibility has been poor in recent days, so they were able to retreat in large numbers. (2nd Reuters dispatch)

Paris - The main force of the British Expeditionary Force retreated yesterday to a semi-circular area of 35 miles around Dunkirk, under the protection of British and French naval artillery and the support of the Royal Air Force. The remaining troops are currently resisting German forces, so that General Beauvoir's troops can break through the narrowest gap to reach the coast. The artillery positions of the Dunkirk fortress have been greatly increased, and the remaining French fortresses along the 35-mile coast have been temporarily shelling German forces. At the same time, Allied naval artillery is also firing. In the evening, bombers and large transport planes take turns dropping food and other items in the fortress positions. Because of the adverse weather conditions, many German aircraft have stopped taking off, so the Allies were able to act calmly. The German side is doing its best to curb the retreat of the troops, with paratrooper units dropping sea mines and torpedo boats traveling along the coast to sink warships. German heavy artillery is shelling Dunkirk and the port's shipping stations outside the Allied semi-circular position. A military spokesman said, "If the German offensive is blocked for a few more days, the British Expeditionary Force will suffer few losses. The Navy's rescue of heroes fleeing from Flanders is a great battle record in its glorious naval history." (2nd United Press dispatch)

German and Italian Newspapers Speculate on the War Situation - Battle for Paris to be Launched

Berlin - German political figures anticipate that the First World War in France will soon end. What is currently being paid attention to is where the second step of the German troops will advance. A Hamburg foreign newspaper stated that Führer Hitler's strategy is to pursue the victory and not allow the enemy to have a chance to breathe, especially in today's favorable situation, and will undoubtedly continue the offensive. The newspaper pointed out that the German army is now only 100 kilometers from Paris, and the French front line is more than 300 kilometers long, with no shortage of weak points that can be attacked. Therefore, the defensive plan of French Commander-in-Chief General Weygand is difficult to implement effectively. (2nd Havas dispatch)

### Franco-Belgian Theater - Fierce British-German Air Battles - French Aircraft Supply Dunkirk Area with Military Supplies - German Aircraft Bomb Lyon, Marseille and Other Places

London - The Air Ministry announced that several of our aircraft had engaged in many fierce battles with enemy aircraft in the Flanders area yesterday while covering the retreat of troops. They also bombed enemy bridges, tank and motorized units, and infantry units. A "Messerschmitt" fighter plane attacked one of our bombers from only 40 yards away, but was eventually repelled by our plane and seen burning. In addition, a group of our bombers engaged two enemy "Junkers" aircraft in the port of Ostend, Belgium, and threw them into the sea before escaping at full speed. The rear machine gun of one of them had been destroyed by our plane. Also, an enemy reconnaissance balloon was shot down by our plane near Nieuport, Belgium. (2nd Havas dispatch)

Paris - The Air Ministry announced that a group of our bombers flew to Dunkirk port last night and dropped military supplies and ammunition by parachute to supply the defending forces. A group of our reconnaissance planes also flew to various parts of the front line this morning for reconnaissance. We obtained important information on the activities of German artillery units on the Bapaume-Amiens line and northeast of Abbeville. Today, a group of our bombers again flew to the north bank of the Somme River to bomb enemy military targets, and dropped no less than 22 tons of giant bombs between Amiens and Doullens. In addition, several enemy aircraft were shot down by our planes in the Rhone River valley. (1st Havas dispatch)

Paris - As the Battle of Flanders draws to a close, there has been a noticeable increase in the activities of the German Air Force in other parts of France. The Lyon area and various places in southwestern France have been subjected to intense bombing. Details are not yet known. Air raid alerts were issued in Saint-Étienne, Roanne, Toulon, and Marseille. As a result of the bombing in Gannat, some people were killed and injured, and some buildings were burned down. (2nd Reuters dispatch)

Paris - It has been learned that German aircraft flew to various cities in southern France today and bombed Lyon, Toulon, and Saint-Étienne, among other cities. Air raid alerts were issued in all of these cities. 40 people were killed or injured in the Lyon area. (1st Havas dispatch)

Rome - A military column analyzing the situation on the Western Front was published in the Roman newspaper Il Popolo d'Italia, claiming that the next major battle will be the battle for Paris. The German high command hopes that the battle in Flanders will end within 24 hours. (2nd United Press dispatch)

Copenhagen - According to the Danish newspaper Politiken, France's current problems are different from those of the past few weeks, and now the German army will adopt an offensive, first encircling the large French forces within the Maginot Line and breaking the resistance of the French army. At that time, Britain will be isolated and unable to maintain contact with the European continent. (2nd Havas dispatch)

British Troops Tenaciously Defend Calais Fortress - Food Supplied by Aircraft

Paris - A spokesman for the French military stated that the Allied forces, mostly British troops, defending Calais are displaying unparalleled heroism in the siege warfare. These few defending troops are supplied with food by parachute and supported by the air force in combat, resisting German troops that outnumber them many times. Although the fort's artillery positions have not been modernized, its walls are still strong and there are deep underground chambers that can avoid aerial bombardment. The spokesman also said that the troops in the Dunkirk area are still boarding ships as quickly as possible despite all kinds of difficulties. German troops have distributed long-range heavy artillery around Dunkirk in the past 24 hours to shell incessantly, and are carrying out intense bombing with the air force. Allied aircraft are launching intensive attacks, not only causing heavy damage to German bombers, but also to German troops on the ground. (2nd Reuters dispatch)

Berlin - Official sources here have confirmed the news about the sinking of the British Home Fleet flagship HMS Nelson. (2nd Havas dispatch)

Berlin - A German Foreign Office spokesman told foreign reporters last night that the British Home Fleet flagship HMS Nelson has sunk, but for military reasons, the time, location, and cause of the sinking have not been released. It was only announced that 700 of the ship's 1,230 crew members were killed. The ship has a displacement of 33,950 tons, was launched in 1925, has a speed of 13.5 knots, is equipped with nine 40.6 cm caliber cannons, twelve 15.2 cm caliber gun positions, six 12 cm gun positions, four 4.7 cm caliber anti-aircraft guns, two torpedo launchers, and carries one aircraft. Its combat range is 5,000 miles. (2nd Havas dispatch)

Editorial

### The Expansion of the European War and Shanghai's Future

The British and French Allied forces have just retreated from the Flanders area after a bitter battle, and the issue of Italy's participation in the war has reached a critical point. The international situation is clearly continuing to unfold in adversity. In the future, wars and chaos will follow one another, and their impact and outcome cannot be predicted at present. As a result, the hearts of the people in the isolated island have also become turbulent in recent days; the future and safety of Shanghai have clearly become the most concerning issue for people.

In fact, this is not a new issue. In the past three years, Shanghai people have had at least two similar experiences: the Sudetenland dispute and the outbreak of the war in Western Europe both caused the atmosphere in Shanghai to become tense at one time. However, those two crises were quickly resolved, so people, apart from experiencing some emotional fluctuations, did not seem to deeply understand their meaning and lessons. What followed was the prevalence of speculation and hoarding, and the pursuit of personal gain reached an unprecedented peak. The sacred cause that the nation and the nation were experiencing was gradually diluted in people's minds due to the long period of time and the remote space. Recently, because of the expansion of the European War, people have once again felt concerned about the future of Shanghai. In fact, this is just an expansion and continuation of an old problem after the Chinese army withdrew from Songhu.

Comparing the previous two incidents with the current one, the Japanese attitude in the autumn of 1938 was the most arrogant. When Chamberlain flew to Berchtesgaden twice, the situation in Shanghai also became unprecedentedly serious along with the European continent. At that time, the Japanese warlords seemed to be waiting for the news of the breakdown of the European situation to immediately test their sharp edge in Shanghai. When the European War broke out last autumn, although the Japanese side also asked Britain and France to withdraw their troops stationed in China, their posture was relatively mild, and after Britain and France did not consider it, they got along peacefully and there were no major changes. Until recently, Japanese public opinion was extremely mixed, but its military and political authorities were unusually cautious, and have not yet made any explicit expressions. This change in attitude naturally cannot be immediately concluded as representing the Japanese action, but it can be seen that the Japanese warlords have gradually changed from tense to cautious. And what determines this change in the Japanese warlords is none other than the setbacks and lessons that the Japanese side has suffered in the invasion of China. If the European War had broken out between 1935 and 1936, not to mention Shanghai, a small area, I am afraid that all the powers' possessions in the Far East would have been regarded as loot by the heroes of Miyakezaka. Also, if China's resistance to Japan had unfortunately failed or compromised, then Shanghai's neutral situation would never have been maintained for three years. Therefore, the future of Shanghai cannot be separated from the entire anti-Japanese war of resistance. Speaking from a local situation alone: Shanghai may not experience any accidents in the near future. Because the powers are determined to maintain the status quo in Shanghai; a few days ago, US Fleet Commander Hart also took precautionary measures on the Shanghai situation. The Japanese warlords, even though they are already drooling over the Dutch East Indies, whose country has been completely occupied, dare not act rashly. Therefore, even if Italy is involved in the whirlpool of the European War, Shanghai's safety may not be immediately disturbed in any way. However, looking further ahead: since the international situation is continuing to deteriorate, no corner of the world may be able to escape the entire disaster alone. Which of Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, and Belgium is not an independent country that has no desire to contend with the world, but all of them cannot escape the nightmare of being invaded and enslaved. If the European War continues to expand, it is not known how many innocent people and countries will be involved. At the same time, a nation that is seeking liberation through resistance is actually paying attention to the safety of its own lives and property, which cannot be regarded as a kind of illusion. If we take a step back and say that Shanghai alone can stay away from all disasters for a long time and form a disguised utopia, then how can an isolated island and its residents that cannot produce on their own continue to maintain their survival in the turmoil of the world? It must be known that the welfare of the four or five million people in Shanghai is not only tied to the fate of the isolated island, and the changes in the international situation, but mainly depends on the future of China's anti-Japanese construction cause. If we temporarily put aside the current smoky environment and turn to look at the great rear of free China, then everything is too optimistic! Three years of hard fighting have tempered and rejuvenated the long-buried national spirit and vitality, and have shown vigorous phenomena in all aspects. For example, the cruel bombing of Japanese planes may cause people to imagine tremors; but in fact, whether in cities or towns, it only aroused the spirit of raising donations and revival, and unlike what the Japanese military spokesman hoped, it will not cause the Chinese people's spirit of resistance to be destroyed. Moreover, often after the bombing, while clearing away the rubble, new foundations are laid to engage in reconstruction. It is said that some cities have been completely renovated because they have been bombed. This fully demonstrates the Chinese people's indomitable perseverance, and also symbolizes the future of national rejuvenation. Looking at the military aspect again: recently, the British, French, and Belgian Allied forces fought against German tanks, and the military equipment of both sides was comparable, but the battle situation turned into a one-sided situation; while the inferiority of China's military equipment is almost disproportionate to the Japanese army, but it can stand up to the Japanese army for three years, and repeatedly defeat the Japanese army's mechanized units and blitzkrieg strategy. This is such an exciting thing and strengthens confidence. Therefore, if we only think about the immediate interests of ourselves, we may feel that there are dead ends everywhere; but if we focus on the long-term prospects of the nation, then there is nothing but light. Knowing this, people really do not need to worry about the safety of the isolated island, only by contributing human and material resources to the motherland to promote the early arrival of victory in the anti-Japanese war of resistance is the supreme way to ensure personal interests.

### Washington Official Circles Predict Germany and Italy Will Adopt a "Peace" Offensive; Fascist Party Congress Resolves to Support Joining the War; Anglo-French Relations with Italy Worsen

New York, United Press Dispatch from its Washington diplomatic correspondent: U.S. official circles predict that Germany and Italy will launch a "peace offensive" and issue an ultimatum to support it. Should this "offensive" fail, Italy will then enter the war. Washington officials have not yet received definitive information on this matter, but according to the most reliable sources, Italy will propose a general outline of peace proposals to the Allied nations in the name of itself and Germany. The details will be decided at a future peace conference. Italy's demands on Britain and France will also be included. As seen by Washington observers, Italy's recent military preparations and various belligerent gestures are "tactics" for the peace offensive. In their view, Mussolini is not merely making empty threats. Once the ultimatum is issued, there will be no possibility of retreat. (Havas, 1st)

London, Well-informed sources here recently commented that certain neutral countries, especially the United States, have subtly advised Italy that maintaining neutrality is advantageous and that joining the war would be detrimental in various ways. However, this advice has not been effective. It is said that these countries may make similar efforts again, but it is unlikely to achieve anything. In Italy's view, this is merely a "blackmail" tactic, hoping that Britain and France will make significant concessions. However, the result of such concessions would only delay Italy's entry into the war. Aware of this, Britain and France, in addition to taking preventive measures on land, sea, and air, will also exert significant economic pressure on Italy. The effectiveness of this policy will soon be seen. (Havas, 1st)

Rome, The National Executive Committee of the Fascist Party recently convened here, chaired by Secretary-General Muti. It immediately passed a resolution stating that our country lost 600,000 officers and soldiers in the last European war, a very significant sacrifice. Subsequently, it suffered "unjust sanctions" during the Abyssinian campaign. Today, this Committee feels that the current blockade is suffocating our country and unanimously supports our leader (referring to Prime Minister Mussolini) in striving for our country's maritime independence. (Havas, 1st)

Rome, According to foreign observers, Italy's entry into the war is imminent, likely to coincide with Germany's attack on French forces, with offensives launched in multiple locations. North African French Tunisia and British Malta in the Mediterranean are the main targets. At that time, the Italian navy and air force, assisted by the Swedish air force, will launch a fierce attack on British and French fleets in the Mediterranean. However, Italy's entry into the war will not affect the attitude of the Balkan countries. Turkey and Yugoslavia will only join Britain and France after being attacked by Italy. Italy, not wanting to fight on two fronts simultaneously, will naturally avoid attacking Turkey and Yugoslavia. Furthermore, Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu's resignation, replaced by the pro-German Gigurtu, indicates a shift in the country's policy towards the German-Italian axis, which is noteworthy. (Havas, 2nd)

Rome, According to inquiries from reliable neutral diplomatic sources, Italy's participation in the European war is a matter of days. Diplomats and well-informed Italian political figures emphasize that Italy is fully prepared militarily and determined to break the Anglo-French grip on the Mediterranean. (Haitong, 2nd)

Rome, Prime Minister Mussolini met with the commander of the Italian air force, Felain, yesterday and gave instructions. (Haitong, 2nd)

Rome, Relations between the Allied countries and Italy continue to deteriorate. Consequently, foreigners are hurriedly leaving Italy. Trains heading towards the border are full of foreigners. However, French and British nationals who went to the Ministry of Interior to obtain exit permits were told to return in five days, at which time, if approved, the permits would be issued. Passersby generally expect Italy to enter the war between June 4th and June 14th. The Italian cabinet is scheduled to meet on June 4th. Crown Prince Umberto, commander-in-chief of the northern region, took a special train to Turin yesterday. German Ambassador Mackensen saw him off at the station. The Crown Prince was wearing civilian clothes. General Graziani, former governor of Abyssinia, also accompanied him. The Crown Prince will inspect the annual gathering of the national reserve infantry in Genoa. He will also participate in the annual infantry gathering in Fiume on June 8th, 9th, and 13th. (Reuters, 2nd)

Paris, According to French officials, the breakdown of the Anglo-Italian contraband agreement negotiations has had an immediate impact on several issues that had virtually been resolved between France and Italy. The agreements that were supposed to be signed are now temporarily suspended. (Reuters, 2nd)

Washington, White House spokesman O'Leary yesterday denied the rumor that President Roosevelt had recently spoken with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini via wireless telephone. (Associated Press, 2nd)

### British "Navy" Special Issue Warns Italy: Italy's Entry into War Will Be Disadvantageous

London, Yesterday, the British naval and military officers' publication "Navy" published an article discussing Italy's entry into the war and warned Italy that if it joins the war, it will be very disadvantageous to Mussolini. Admiral Fremantle, a renowned naval officer who has experienced many wars, discussed Anglo-Italian naval warfare in detail in the publication and said he believed that Italian intervention would not harm the Allied forces but would harm Italy. Furthermore, Brigadier Montgomery-Massingberd, former Director of the British General Staff, said that Mussolini has incited Italy's ignorant youth, causing a war fever, believing that Italy can gain glory in this war, not knowing that when bombs and machine guns fall on these young people, their uncontrollable war fever will immediately dissipate. However, Montgomery-Massingberd and Fremantle share the same view that the Allies should not underestimate Italy's resources and combat capabilities. (Associated Press, 2nd)

### Egyptian King Receives British Ambassador, Discusses Mediterranean Situation; German Jews Detained in Palestine

Cairo, Egypt, King Farouk recently received British Ambassador Sir Lampson for a lengthy discussion on the Mediterranean situation. He then received Prime Minister Maher. The cabinet held a meeting to discuss ways to strengthen precautions against paratroopers. (Havas, 2nd)

Milan, According to reports from Cairo, the Egyptian parliament has passed a law expanding government powers, allowing the government to take all necessary measures and issue decrees for national defense needs during wartime. (Haitong, 2nd)

Jerusalem, Palestine continues to carry out various preparations to guard against emergencies. The police have completed the arrest of all German residents (including some women) throughout the territory. Steps are now being taken to prevent the possibility of "Fifth Column" activities from other sources. Currently, the police have begun a thorough investigation of a secret radio station that broadcasts the views of Jewish extremists and alarming news. The detained Germans are now confined in large barracks outside major cities. (Reuters, 2nd)

### Spain Demands Return of Gibraltar; Demonstrations in Front of British Embassy; Spanish Military Delegation Arrives in Berlin

Madrid, Spanish students held a demonstration yesterday, chanting "Gibraltar" and singing the Falange party anthem. The British and French embassies were heavily guarded by police and armored vehicles. The demonstrators were dispersed by the police at one point, but they continued to march in groups, chanting "Gibraltar." (Haitong, 2nd)

Madrid, The new British Ambassador to Spain, Hoare, arrived here yesterday. Subsequently, several thousand Spanish citizens gathered in front of the embassy, chanting "Who does the Strait of Gibraltar belong to?" Then they shouted, "It belongs to Spain!" The police arrived and dispersed the crowd. (Haitong, 2nd)

Madrid, The Spanish Falange party newspaper "Arriba" stated that Spain's demand for the return of Gibraltar is not because the port is a historical fortress, but because it is Spain's sacred and inviolable land. The isolated fortress of Gibraltar has lost its military value to Britain. The newspaper pointed out that Gibraltar was the key to the Mediterranean in the age of sailing ships. Since the invention of submarines and airplanes, Gibraltar can no longer control the entrance to the Mediterranean. Spain's air bases in Andalusia can dispatch aircraft within minutes to control all key points in the Strait of Gibraltar. The British fleet can no longer obtain safe protection in the port of Gibraltar. (Haitong, 2nd)

Berlin, The German Commander-in-Chief hosted a banquet for Spanish officials. A Spanish delegation of three generals and nine officials arrived in Berlin today. The delegation is led by General Tank Cruz. The delegation is here to view various military facilities and plans to tour the Western Front. (Haitong, 2nd)

Rome, A Spanish military committee of thirty senior officers visited Genoa and Milan yesterday. The delegation is scheduled to depart for Berlin last night. (Reuters, 3rd)

Rome, Mussolini's mouthpiece, the renowned journalist Gayda, published an article this morning reviewing the Gibraltar issue, stating that Gibraltar was bombarded by British warships on July 21, 1704, and occupied two days later. The British casualties were 300. Spain's indignation at the fall of Gibraltar goes without saying. Currently, Spain's demand for the return of Gibraltar is a legitimate desire. (Haitong, 2nd)

### British Expeditionary Force Evacuation Situation; British Soldiers Recount Experiences

A port in southeastern coastal Britain, Allied warships from Dunkirk shelled German forces last night that were attempting to prevent the Allied evacuation from the Flanders region. British Expeditionary Force soldiers who recently evacuated here claimed that the Allies used various ships in Dunkirk to evacuate "the besieged Allied forces in northern France." One British soldier claimed, "The Allied situation deteriorated. They waited on the sand dunes, several miles long outside the leveled city of Dunkirk, for ships to evacuate. They dug holes in the sand to hide. While the soldiers were digging holes, they were repeatedly attacked by German artillery, planes, bombs, and aerial machine guns." British and French soldiers who recently arrived here told reporters that German forces were approaching Dunkirk and were shelling Dunkirk with mortars. Around Dunkirk, the Allies used all vehicles and destroyed lumber to create a final defense line to resist the German forces. In addition, the Allies only relied on rifles and the cannons of naval warships to fight. The Allied forces in Dunkirk were mostly rear-guard units. They had nothing but rifles and relied on the navy's cannons as their only savior. In the past few days, I have spoken with British and French soldiers who have experienced air raids and spent their days on the beaches. The conditions they encountered are unparalleled in British history. Yesterday, German planes bombed British transport ships, and the artillery fire on both sides was intense. Both sides suffered heavy losses. The sound of heavy artillery can be heard here. According to soldiers who recently arrived here, the final defense lines built by the British and French forces in the Flanders region and Dunkirk were guarded by soldiers carrying rifles. In the early stages of the retreat, the Allied forces were protected by heavy artillery, but when they retreated to the coast, the Allied forces used rifles to resist German four-inch mortars, heavy artillery, and automatic weapons. During the final series of attacks, the German army did not use tanks. It is generally speculated that the German army stopped attacking with mechanized units and replaced them with artillery and infantry. A Scottish soldier told reporters, "This battle is fluid. Soldiers cannot dig trenches. What they encounter is fierce artillery fire from the enemy. The enemy first uses heavy artillery, then four-inch mortars, and then attacks with very low-flying planes. After these three attacks, the enemy soldiers have already rushed to within fifteen yards of the British lines. This happened repeatedly. When the German artillery stopped firing, our soldiers, lying on the ground, looked up and saw a large number of German soldiers carrying light machine guns and rifles. They had already arrived. We repelled them, but they came again. In an environment where we were outnumbered ten to one, we could only retreat step by step. Our retreat was orderly, and we repeatedly inflicted heavy damage on the enemy, but because of the enemy's superior equipment, we could only fight step by step. If we had the same equipment as the enemy, we could end the war in three months. When we fight the enemy one-on-one, the enemy cannot resist. Even with inferior weapons, we can often repel the enemy. We only use bayonets and rifles." (Associated Press, 2nd)

### Southern Helgeland Norwegian Army Retreats

Somewhere in Norway, the German High Command announced that the Norwegian army in the southern Helgeland region has retreated smoothly under strong German pressure. (Reuters, 2nd)

### Churchill Scheduled to Report on the War Tomorrow

London, Prime Minister Churchill will deliver a speech on Tuesday regarding the progress of the war. According to a Reuters reporter, it is generally hoped that Churchill will be able to announce the evacuation of Allied forces from Flanders, and also make a statement on last Friday's Supreme Military Council. (Reuters, 2nd)

### Japanese Troops Break Through Near Zaozhong Associated Electricity, Suffered Head-on Attack by Chinese Troops, Fierce Fighting Occurs at Zishan Zhangjiaji, Japanese Troops Crossing the Han River Have Been Repelled

Yichang, The Japanese troops who collapsed and entrenched themselves near Zao Yang were fiercely attacked by the Chinese pursuing troops in several ways. Countless Japanese were killed. By the 30th of last month, the Japanese could not hold out and broke through in groups and retreated. One group retreated southeast to the vicinity of the Futan Township in Zishan.

### Military Commission Releases Weekly War Report, May 26th to June 1st

Chongqing: A spokesman for the Military Commission discussed the war situation from this past week (May 26th to June 1st), stating that the fiercest fighting occurred on the borders of Henan and Hubei provinces and in southern Shanxi. The Chinese army continued to achieve brilliant victories. On other battlefields, fierce battles raged between Chinese and Japanese forces, with the Chinese army consistently inflicting defeats on the Japanese. A detailed account of the operations follows:

Henan-Hubei: Remnants of the Japanese army in northern Hubei, after their defeat last week, find themselves in an increasingly desperate situation. The Chinese army is simultaneously clearing out remaining Japanese troops near places such as Yangjiadang, Chengjiahe, and Taipingzhen, while also pursuing and encircling Japanese forces in the area north of the Dabie Mountains. Significant victories have been repeatedly achieved this past week. The remnants of the Japanese army attempted to break through the Xianghua Road and Zaozhong Road to retreat, but were defeated, leaving behind several thousand corpses. Currently, the Chinese are tightening the encirclement while simultaneously adopting new tactics to pressure the Japanese army. On top of their defeats, they are on the verge of complete annihilation. Furthermore, in the Xinyang area, the Chinese army captured Lianghekou and repeatedly stormed strongholds such as Wangjiadian and Dongshuanghe, capturing and killing many enemies. The southern section of the Pinghan Railway has been cut off by the Chinese army.

Guangdong-Guangxi: The Chinese army in southern Guangdong continued its victories from last week, launching fierce attacks on the Japanese. They successively recovered places such as Dahua'ao, Heshui'ao, Jinjinao, Shiliuwei, Tanghenkeng, Fengdou'ao, Fenghuoling, and Wugongshan. On the 26th, they captured Liangkou in one fell swoop, killing countless Japanese soldiers. The Japanese regimental commander Yamamoto Niro was also killed on the spot. To salvage their overall losses, the Japanese have been continuously reinforcing their troops south of Liangkou. Currently, they are engaged in fierce battles with the Chinese forces near Mibu. The Japanese army in southern Guangxi has repeatedly invaded Tunlun and Dazhi, but has been repeatedly defeated by the Chinese, leaving behind many corpses.

Hunan-Jiangxi: The Chinese army in northern Hunan has repeatedly launched mobile offensives, achieving significant gains. Strongholds such as Dashaping and Zhaoliqiao have been repeatedly stormed by the Chinese army, resulting in the deaths of many Japanese soldiers. Japanese warships in Yueyang have made several attempts to harass, but have all failed. In northern Jiangxi, Japanese forces advanced from Pingze and Duchang towards the Chinese defense line. After being defeated by the Chinese, they retreated in disarray. The Chinese army pursued them along several routes, capturing Tugang and Mamaqiao, and directly pressing towards Huangtuling inside the city of Pengze. Another route led to the capture of Mabiqiao and Caijialing. On the morning of the 27th, Japanese reinforcements attacked Liuhua, but were again defeated by the Chinese. The remnants of the Japanese army retreated in disarray towards Hukou, with the Chinese still in close pursuit.

Southern Shanxi: The Chinese army, through astute and meticulous deployment, recaptured the strongholds of Xianweng Mountain and Zisha Village southeast of Qinshui on the 27th, killing a large number of Japanese soldiers. While the Chinese and Japanese forces were engaged in fierce battle, Japanese reinforcements arrived from Qinshui and Duanshi, but were again defeated by the Chinese as they advanced east from Xianweng Mountain. In this battle, over sixty Japanese soldiers were killed, over twenty Japanese vehicles were destroyed, and over a thousand boxes of artillery shells and over ten bags of rice were seized. Japanese forces near Yangcheng launched a joint land and air offensive starting on the 26th. One unit invaded Longzhang and Wenjialing on the 27th, but after being fiercely attacked by the Chinese overnight, Wenjialing was recaptured by dawn on the 28th. Remnants of the Japanese forces in Longzhang are still being surrounded and annihilated. Another unit attacked the areas of North and South Xiangtai and Upper and Lower Baisang, but after being fiercely attacked by the Chinese, the Japanese suffered over half their casualties. Currently, the Chinese are simultaneously blocking the enemy while sending strong forces to encircle the enemy's rear. It will not be difficult to annihilate these Japanese forces completely. Furthermore, Maeda Osamu, the Japanese division commander who was wounded, has died of his injuries in Beiping. In addition, in northern Henan, on the 22nd and 23rd, the Chinese army destroyed three Japanese bridges and killed over ten Japanese officers, including Okada, in the Youmiao area.

Northern Jiangsu: Japanese forces in Gaoyou and other places launched offensives towards places such as Yuhekou, but were repeatedly fiercely attacked by the Chinese, resulting in many Japanese deaths. The Japanese also released large amounts of poison gas. Yuhekou once fell into Japanese hands on the 26th but was recaptured by a fierce Chinese counterattack on the 29th. The remnants of the Japanese army retreated in disarray, with a total of over 1,500 Japanese soldiers killed. Hasegawa, the Japanese garrison commander in Shaobo, was also killed by the Chinese near Renqiao on the 29th. Furthermore, on the 28th, the Chinese air force destroyed over a thousand Japanese vehicles near Anlu, killing many Japanese soldiers. On the same day, two Japanese heavy bombers were shot down outside the city, and another Japanese heavy bomber was shot down on the 29th.

### Eradication of Opium Addiction Depends on Victory in the War of Resistance: Sun Ke's Opinion on the Eve of Anti-Smoking Day

Chongqing: Legislative Yuan President Sun Ke recently gave a speech on the eve of the centenary of the Opium War, stating that China must resolutely resist all imperialist evils. The Chinese people have already resolved to liberate themselves and not be conquered by foreign powers. President Sun appealed to all those addicted to opium to make a firm resolution to save themselves and said that whether China can completely eradicate opium depends on victory in this war of resistance. "Who can forget the horrors of opium? In 1840, Mr. Lin Zexu engaged in burning opium to resist the imperialist powers who invaded us a hundred years ago. In the past three years, our resistance has fully demonstrated our desire to liberate ourselves from our semi-colonial status. We have decided to fight against all imperialist evils in order to completely eliminate them." The National Anti-Smoking Conference will be held in Chongqing tomorrow to discuss Chairman Chiang's six-year anti-smoking plan, and this year is the last phase of the six-year plan to eliminate opium addiction in Free China.

### China Will Surely Unite to the End to Strive for Final Victory; Has Established a Strong and Powerful Army Sufficient to Fight for Freedom and Independence

Chongqing: A report from Moscow states that the latest issue of the World Economy and Politics magazine, edited by the renowned Soviet scholar Varga, contains a special article discussing the Chinese political situation, stating that China has established a strong and powerful army during the war of resistance, which is sufficient to fight for China's freedom and independence. The Chinese people and army have united to fight to the death against Japanese imperialism. As a result of this war, Japan's political and military strength are showing signs of collapse. Conversely, the Chinese army's combat capabilities and political awareness have greatly increased, and its previous military and technical shortcomings are gradually being eliminated. At the same time, the mechanized units, military experts, and superior tactics that Japan previously relied upon for its advantage are no longer evident. This proves that China has progressed in this war, while Japan has regressed. Under the leadership of Chairman Chiang and the National Government, China has unified its army, which is extremely important. This is why China is becoming stronger and Japan is becoming weaker. Last year, someone from the Japanese side declared that the China problem cannot be solved by bayonets and must be shifted from large-scale military operations to political activities, seeking to collude with China's reactionary elements. Japan's weaknesses are becoming increasingly apparent, and its desire to rely on puppets is becoming more urgent, while the position of the Chinese National Government is becoming stronger as a result. Japan is currently using Wang Jingwei and the puppet Kuomintang, but Wang has no social standing and has even less status after becoming a Japanese puppet. In addition, the Japanese side is engaging in absurd propaganda in an attempt to undermine China's internal unity. In reality, China will surely unite to the end, jointly resist the invaders and reactionary elements, and achieve final victory. (2nd Dispatch)

### General Comforting Association Seeks Donations for Air Force慰劳品

### Commander of French Colonial Army's Message to Soldiers

Paris: General Honzig, Commander of the Colonial Army, recently published a message to his soldiers, stating, "The war has already begun. What the enemy wants to attack is our army's morale. Their strategy is to win by intimidation. In reality, large-scale aerial bombing, although fierce, has limited effectiveness, as proven by the facts. The method of dealing with it is very simple. When enemy aircraft attack, hide; once finished, return to your posts. Moreover, our army also has aircraft for cover, so what is there to fear? As for tanks, they cannot do much either. Each soldier can temporarily hide and let them pass, then attack the guide. Tank teams without guides are like blind men. Each tank must have gasoline supply to operate. In short, do not be misled by rumors and obey the orders of your superiors." (2nd Havas Dispatch)

### US Army Chief of Staff Supports Authorizing President to Call Up National Guard; 600 US Private Aircraft Sold to Allies for Use

Washington: President Roosevelt recently requested the government to grant him full power to call up the National Guard to cope with the possibility of "dangerous developments" in the Western Hemisphere. US Army Chief of Staff Marshall yesterday issued a statement expressing his support for the President's request, saying, "The US Army currently has only five streamlined infantry divisions (each with 8,500 men) serving in the US mainland. The sixth division is being organized. After a dispute occurs in the Western Hemisphere, the United States must have more trained troops." General Marshall did not specify where the dispute will occur in the Western Hemisphere, but due to the European war, questions have been raised here about the status of Britain, France, Denmark, and the Netherlands in the Western Hemisphere. In addition, there are widespread rumors in the United States that pro-German political activities are already underway in Latin America. (2nd United Press Dispatch)

Washington: The War Department issued an official gazette today stating that President Roosevelt's request for Congress to grant him the special power to call up the National Guard is solely intended to obtain the power to call up this force to train the National Guard on how to use new weapons.

However, some senators support President Roosevelt's proposal. US Army officers said they do not want to disrupt the current status of the 235,000 National Guardsmen and 14,000 reservist officers, because calling up these troops to active duty would force them to give up their personal jobs, resulting in unemployment. All officers agree that the authorized limit of the regular army should be set at 450,000 men, saying that this number can be reached by voluntary enlistment. (2nd United Press Dispatch)

### Chinese Government Concerned About British-Japanese Negotiations; Ambassador Guo Visits British Foreign Office, Urges Not to Hinder China's War of Resistance

London: Chinese Ambassador to Britain Guo Taiqi visited the British Foreign Office yesterday afternoon, expressing the Chinese government's extreme concern about the reopened British-Japanese commercial treaty negotiations. A United Press reporter inquired about this matter with the British Foreign Office. A spokesperson for the British Foreign Office denied the claim that Britain would guarantee the supply of gasoline to Japan, saying that the gasoline issue was not mentioned in the British-Japanese negotiations. However, it was indicated in the British-Japanese talks that rubber and tin produced in the Dutch East Indies and Malaya would be exported to Japan. It is generally believed that the items Britain will export to Japan include timber produced in the British Empire. As for Japan, it is promised to stop transporting raw materials for war from Dalian and Vladivostok to Germany. Regarding Ambassador Guo's expression to British Undersecretary Butler yesterday, both the Chinese and British officials remain silent. However, the League of Nations had a resolution stipulating that all member states should not engage in any actions that hinder China's war of resistance. Furthermore, the British government has repeatedly stated that Britain's Far East policy is always in line with the United States. The British government will certainly recall these two facts.

### French Scholar Levy Discusses Soviet-Japanese Relations

Paris: Far East expert Levy recently gave a speech at the National Overseas Territories College, titled "The Relationship Between the Soviet Union and Japan." He said, "The Japanese side is still very suspicious of the Soviet Union. At the same time, the Soviet Union is also quite uneasy about the progress Japan has made in China. Therefore, even if the German government wants to entice the Soviet Union with illusory ideals, the Soviet Union knows that if it wants to expand new territories, it must first maintain its existing territories. Therefore, it still only considers reality. In short, the Soviet Union's position is on the shores of the Pacific Ocean, which is a historical tradition, and will not go elsewhere."

European War Background

### Record of a Mission of Shame to Germany (3) Translated from the original by Sir Nevile Henderson

I was summoned back to England at the end of January 1938, to receive instructions in order to negotiate with Hitler. Judging from the German press and what Hitler occasionally revealed to the British, there were two main obstacles between England and Germany. One was the anti-German policy adopted by England in Europe, and the other was the refusal to return the colonies "seized" from the Germans. I was instructed to inform Hitler that the British government was, in principle, prepared to discuss all outstanding issues.

I returned to my post on February 4th. Seeing that the atmosphere was unfavorable, I postponed my visit to Hitler until March 3rd. By this time, Lord Halifax had succeeded Eden as Foreign Secretary. On this day, I visited the Old Reich Chancellery and was invited to sit on a large sofa against the wall facing the window. Dr. Schmidt, the translator of the German Foreign Ministry, sat to my left. Further to the left, forming a semicircle, Hitler sat in an armchair with rounded arms, facing me, and next to him was Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. After stating the purpose of my visit, I said that my intention was not to haggle. The British government was well aware of the many thorns ahead, but was also convinced that if both sides could act on the basis of reciprocity and replace force with higher principles, all difficulties could be resolved. The status quo could be changed, but on the basis of higher reasons. What needed to be reviewed urgently between the two countries was the reduction of armaments, the restriction of bombing (the British government also hoped to abolish bombers), and the peaceful settlement of the Czech, Austrian, and colonial issues. What I wanted to know was what contribution Germany was prepared to make to maintaining peace in Europe.

This was perhaps the longest statement I had ever made to Hitler, lasting about ten minutes. He listened quietly, huddled in his chair, his face grim, occasionally revealing displeasure. However, my tone was firm and moderate, making Hitler's expression unnecessary. After I finished speaking, Hitler immediately said that he could do nothing until the British newspapers stopped attacking him. (He repeated this point in every conversation.) He also could not tolerate interference by third countries in Central European affairs. Millions of Germans were being treated unfairly. Germans should enjoy the same rights to self-determination and autonomy as other nations. Only 15 percent of Austrians supported the Schuschnigg government. If Britain opposed a reasonable solution, the Germans would only resort to force. If German nationals in the area were oppressed, he would intervene with lightning speed. Austria must hold a plebiscite to determine its fate, and the Germanic residents of Czechoslovakia should obtain autonomy in cultural and other affairs.

He was not interested in the colonial issue. For half an hour, he kept complaining about the attacks in the British newspapers, the interference of British bishops in German church affairs, and British interference in various matters (according to Hitler, these matters had nothing to do with Britain to begin with), as well as the abuse of National Socialists and Germans in the Czech and Austrian territories. He then returned to the issue of disarmament, claiming that the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact and the strength of Czechoslovakia were both threats to Germany. Therefore, German armaments had to be greatly expanded, and any discussion of disarmament should be transferred to the Soviet Union. The most difficult thing was that "some people actually trust treaties signed with the uncivilized Soviet Union. It should be known that any treaty signed by the Soviet Union is worthless, and that country must not be allowed to set foot in Europe." Even regarding the prohibition of using poison gas, who could believe that Soviet Russia would never break its word?

I met with Hitler for about two hours, during which Ribbentrop offered some opinions to Hitler regarding the attitude of the British newspapers. I immediately asked him how a person who had lived in Canada for many years and had been an envoy to Britain could be so ignorant of British psychology and customs. At that time, Hitler did not yet listen to Ribbentrop as he would later, and could still understand my rebuttal.

On the evening of March 11th, Göring held a grand banquet and dance at the Aviation Association, with thousands of guests. I was also invited to attend. Everyone was discussing the Austrian issue. At this time, someone handed me a telegram, urging me to talk to Neurath. The whole room fell silent, and two thousand pairs of eyes were focused on me. Shortly after, Göring arrived and shook hands with us, looking very lonely. After sitting down, he tore off half of the program and wrote a short note in pencil, which he had the American ambassador's wife deliver to me. It read, "I would like to have a talk at the end of the party and explain everything." The last five words were underlined three times. I waited for an opportunity to follow Göring out of the hall. For the next three-quarters of an hour, everyone speculated about what had happened.

The conversation between the two of us in Göring's private room was not pleasant. Göring accused Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg of being untrustworthy, and that there was no other way but the current method. Shortly after, I learned that the German army and air force had crossed the border and Austria had been annexed.

I defended Schuschnigg until I was hoarse. Finally, I said to Göring, "Even if the Austrian Chancellor is unwise, the Germans cannot use this as an excuse to send troops." Then I took the opportunity to urge Göring not to harm the Austrian National Socialists. Upon returning to the hall, I made another suggestion to Göring that if he did not want Hitler to know the British public's reaction to this, it would be best to prevent Hitler from seeing the British newspapers for two weeks.

At this point, there is one more thing that must be recorded. March 13th was the German Day of Remembrance for soldiers who died in Europe. Representatives from various countries participated in the memorial service as usual, but I declined to participate due to the German-Austrian incident, the blood of which had not yet dried. Moreover, to express an underlying meaning, I visited the Austrian ambassador instead. I went by car, with the British flag displayed on the front of the car. When I arrived, I saw the Austrian ambassador in full military uniform, preparing to attend the memorial service. Afterwards, I heard people say that the Austrian ambassador had given the National Socialist salute at the meeting and had shouted "Heil Hitler" with the crowd.

From then on, the Czech issue became tense, and Prime Minister Chamberlain first flew to Berchtesgaden, then to Godesberg, and finally to Munich. I do not want to make hasty judgments about the Prime Minister's tireless efforts, leaving them to be criticized by historians in the future. At that time, some people, overestimating their abilities and unwilling to reject the moral ground of the right to self-determination in the Sudetenland, felt that our response to Hitler's bluff in September 1938 was a mistake, which I think is completely wrong. It should be known that simply saying "no" to a dictator does not help. At the time, I said, "To deal with Hitler's intimidation, we must be prepared to bear all the consequences." Did France have this preparation at the time, let alone Britain?

After Prime Minister Chamberlain decided to meet with Hitler, he departed from London at 8:30 a.m. on September 15, 1938, and flew to Munich four hours later. That morning, I took the train to meet him. The Prime Minister, at the advanced age of sixty-nine, traveled by car and boat for ten hours, and then met with Ribbentrop and Hitler for a long time, and telegraphed the details to London. He was busy all day and did not go to bed until eleven o'clock at night. He claimed to have strong bones, and his belief was not false.

He arrived at Berchtesgaden at about 4 p.m. that afternoon and rested briefly at the inn. Then he drove to Hitler's mountain villa. Hitler came down the steps to welcome him. During tea, they chatted for about twenty minutes. Hitler then invited Chamberlain to talk in his study.

I did not want Ribbentrop to be involved. The meeting records were kept by Ribbentrop, which was against the usual practice and were not shown to Chamberlain, causing the Prime Minister much inconvenience, especially during later talks. Fortunately, in subsequent talks, Welles was present, and I also sometimes participated.

The first conversation lasted for three hours. Hitler stated that peace negotiations should be based on the recognition of the right to self-determination of the Germans in the Sudetenland. Chamberlain acknowledged this principle, but it had to be approved by the cabinet and agreed to by the French and Czech governments. At this point, Hitler made an appointment for another talk.

The next morning, Chamberlain flew back to London. He immediately summoned Sir Runciman (the British unofficial mediator to Czechoslovakia) back from Czech to England to discuss. The French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister arrived in London on September 18th. In order to maintain peace and uphold the important interests of Czechoslovakia, the British and French governments jointly advised Czechoslovakia not only to recognize the right to self-determination in the Sudetenland, but also to cede land with more than 50 percent of Germans to Germany without a plebiscite.

### Today is Anti-Smoking Day All Circles in Shanghai Determined to Reject Drugs Work Hard to Strengthen the Nation and Smash Drug-Induced Plots Assist the Government in Completing the Anti-Smoking Plan

Today is the anniversary of Lin Zexu's burning of opium in Humen, Guangzhou, which has been designated by the central government as Anti-Smoking Day. The government authorities, in order to implement the anti-smoking policy and revitalize the national spirit, have issued orders to the whole country to ban smoking within a limited time. Various places have taken resolute actions and achieved considerable results. However, since the national army withdrew from Shanghai, the atmosphere of drugs has permeated and the scourge of opium has become rampant. Therefore, all circles in this city, on this Anti-Smoking Day, are deeply vigilant and have decided to follow the national policy and jointly promote the anti-drug movement, advising relatives and friends who are addicted to opium to wake up quickly and quit immediately, so as to save unnecessary expenses and restore a healthy body. In addition, the Shanghai Municipal Party Department, the Sanmin Zhuyi Youth League, the Shanghai Branch of the Youth League, the National Datong League, the Li Sui Society, and others have issued public notices, which are excerpted as follows:

Notice to the Public Issued by the Municipal Party Department

The Shanghai Special Municipal Party Department issued a notice to the citizens of the city on the occasion of the June 3rd Anti-Smoking Commemoration, stating that today is the June 3rd Anti-Smoking Commemoration Day, and also the end of the six-year anti-smoking plan. We know that the former British psychologist Hall once said, "A first-class country cannot be created by citizens with third-class physiques," and "With a golden age of physique, there must be a golden age of culture thirty years later."

Health Related to the Strength or Weakness of the Nation

These few words fully illustrate that health is the key to the strength or weakness of a country. When we are now fighting with all our strength, we should especially cherish our health, conserve our energy, and fight, work hard, and sacrifice for the country and the nation, and continue to show our potential strength and constantly fight with the demons that surround us. We must understand that violent storms are raging in the isolated island, and unreasonable oppression and cruel destruction are coming one after another. We must resist and struggle, we must complete the mission of resistance and construction, and our responsibilities are so important.

Root Out Drugs, Eliminate Drugs Completely

If we do not have a strong physique, everything will be lost. Not to mention that it is impossible to develop our great Chinese culture into a golden age, even preserving our Chinese history of more than 4,000 years is questionable. Therefore, on this day of June 3rd, especially in this year when the six-year anti-smoking plan expires, we should especially keep in mind the following two sentences: "Root out drugs" and "Eliminate drugs completely."

Do Not Smoke Opium, Do Not Sell Drugs

To put it more clearly, drug resistance must be done from the root, and drug resistance must be completely eliminated. We cannot allow ourselves to have the slightest negligence, and we cannot allow ourselves to have the slightest slackness. We will not only not smoke opium from now on, but also not sell any drugs from now on. We will not only not sell any drugs ourselves, but also give a head-on blow to any conspiracy to undermine our anti-smoking plan, and smash it without leaving any traces. Only in this way can the drug resistance problem be thoroughly solved. All citizens of our city, based on this spirit, should be the vanguard of smashing conspiracies, support the central government, obey the President, do it earnestly, and create a vigorous and prosperous China.

Notice to Young People Issued by the Sanmin Zhuyi Youth League

The Shanghai Branch of the Sanmin Zhuyi Youth League issued a notice to the youth of the city, saying, "Dear youth of the city, on June 3, 1839, that is, today 101 years ago, Lin Wen-zhong, Governor-General of Huguang, burned 20,000 boxes of imported opium in Humen, which showed his determination to ban smoking. (Omission)"

Drug Policy is Chilling

In the past ten years or so, on the one hand, the national government has strictly implemented the anti-smoking plan, and on the other hand, Japanese imperialists have been actively promoting the drug policy to find the country. Since the September 18th Incident, the Northeast has been increasingly poisoned under the rule of the Japanese. According to the number of opium smokers in Manchukuo announced by Japan itself in 1938, it was 13 million, accounting for one-third of the total population of Manchukuo. Since the Lugouqiao Incident, Japan has gradually occupied the coastal areas of North China, Central China, and South China, making Tianjin, Shanghai, and Xiamen the base for the poisoning of North China, Central China, and South China.

Determined to Ban Drugs, Smash Conspiracies

In August 1937, after the Japanese army captured Beiping, many prisoners were executed, but this group of opium offenders completely regained their freedom. In 1938, the puppet regime in North China openly abolished the National Government's anti-smoking regulations, and all opium offenders in North China were released. All these facts show how Japanese imperialists want to fully use the drug policy to enslave our nation.

The People Themselves Take Responsibility

President Chiang has repeatedly instructed us that this six-year ban will destroy our country, but the National Government will never neglect the ban because of the Japanese imperialists' military invasion, because the drug policy is a kind of aggressive policy of the Japanese imperialists. We must resist military aggression with military force, and at the same time, we must smash the drug-induced conspiracy with the determination to ban opium.

The People Themselves Take Responsibility

President Chiang has repeatedly instructed us that this six-year anti-smoking plan must be implemented. This year is the final deadline for banning opium, so this year, we must drive the drug atmosphere out of the country. However, in the occupied areas of the Japanese imperialists, the power of the government cannot reach, and this anti-smoking responsibility needs to be borne by our people themselves. President Chiang once instructed us on the Anti-Smoking Day last year, "I hope that all compatriots in the country must assist the government in implementing policies with 120,000 points of sincerity, and everyone should regard anti-smoking as their own responsibility." Especially young people, especially young people in the Shanghai area, need to take this responsibility seriously, because we firmly believe that young people can best embrace this determination to ban drugs, and only by starting with young people can this anti-drug effort be most thorough.

Shanghai Youth Rise Up Together

Youth of Shanghai, we must revitalize our spirit, we must strengthen our physique, and form a powerful new force in the national anti-war front. We must absolutely isolate ourselves from opium. We must continue to resist violent aggression, and we must make the country and the nation stronger day by day. We must not neglect the major policy of banning opium. Slogans: (1) This year is the central government's final deadline for banning opium. (2) Opium is a tool for weakening the spirit. (3) Opium is a sharp weapon for injuring the body. (4) Opium is a demon that destroys one's will. (5) Opium is a shackle that binds the mind.

Various Circles Separately Advise to Eliminate Drugs

The Chinese Seamen's Union Holding Staff Office, taking today as the day when Lin Zexu burned soil in Humen, Guangzhou, which has been designated by the central government as Anti-Smoking Day, the union must convene meetings of seamen from various rounds every year to hold commemorations to promote this year's anti-smoking festival in order to express support for the central government's national policy and encourage seamen from various rounds to have a deeper understanding of the anti-smoking national policy and the spirit of automatic implementation. Therefore, we will implement spiritual commemoration methods, and the union will notify various工友 to hold commemorations separately in the small group meetings of each transmission during their spare time. At the same time, it will also issue a letter to the national seamen工友 on the "June 3rd" anti-smoking festival. In addition, the Shanghai National Datong League Liguo Friendship Society and others have also issued articles, advising to eliminate drugs, and the articles are too long to be included.

### Meeting of Lower-Ranking Officers of the 162nd French Army Division Stationed in Shanghai

The Association of Lower-Ranking Officers of the 162nd French Army Division held a meeting at 10:30 a.m. yesterday (the 2nd) at the Army and Navy Headquarters on Avenue Magy. The French Commander of Defense Forces in China and other military aides were invited to attend.

### French Concession to Increase Taxes Next Month Approved by French Consul General Formal Implementation Still Awaits Announcement

Regarding the French Concession Public Works Bureau's plan to balance the 1940 budget by implementing a slight additional tax from July 1 this year, and the agreed increase in tax rates, as mentioned in the newspaper on May 29, it is now known that the tax increase proposal was proposed by the Director of Finance, Qu Dan (translated), at the Public Works Bureau meeting on the 20th of last month, and has been approved by French Consul General in Shanghai, Eugène. The tax rate increases remain as reported previously, with land tax increasing from 9, 10, and 11 per thousand to 11 to 13 per thousand based on land rights. House tax will increase from 17 percent to 22 percent. The license taxes for other public rickshaws, chartered carriages, privately owned rented carriages, free carriages, privately owned automobiles, mechanical bicycles, public automobiles, freight cars, and delivery vehicles will each increase by 40 percent. It is reported that the French Public Works Bureau, in order to supplement the recent large expenditures, has also taken measures to increase taxes. At that time, it will be implemented simultaneously with the Shanghai Public Concession Public Works Bureau's increase of municipal donation by 50 percent. It is reported that this tax increase method is currently a temporary regulation, and a separate notice will be issued when it is formally implemented.

### "Special Police" To Be Organized Soon; Legal Rights Not To Be Violated; Tax Issue To Be Negotiated By Both Sides; The Bureau Is Unlikely To Overstep The Court's Authority

Regarding the negotiations on road construction beyond the boundaries, since the Shanghai Municipal Council's Chief Inspector Bowen put forward the final proposal, the puppet side has not yet come up with an answer. This intermittent situation does not bode well for the future. However, according to news that came out yesterday, this "Special Police Bureau," which consists of six "branches," has been under detailed negotiation by both sides for more than a month. A concrete agreement between the two parties can be expected to be established by mid-June at the latest. As for other pending issues, such as (1) the closure of gambling dens in the western district of Shanghai, (2) the tax issue, and (3) the court issue, it is said that "they will also be resolved soon."

"Special Police Department" Likely To Be Established

According to someone familiar with the Shanghai Municipal Council, the council is making its best efforts to find ways to improve the current situation. Eliminating secret organizations and the existence of evil forces in the lawless area is a matter of great urgency. Therefore, the leading group has repeatedly sent personnel to negotiate with the Japanese intelligence agencies. Japanese Consul Miura believes that the most effective method is to quickly establish a "Special Police Department." Therefore, given the trend of the situation, this "police department" may be established in the middle of the month. This is evidenced by the prior closure of gambling dens, which makes it even more likely to be realized.

Court Issue Unlikely To Be Compromised

As for the tax issue, the Shanghai Municipal Council has appointed Director-General Fessenden, Deputy Director-General Keswick, and Finance Director Moller to negotiate with the puppet side's representatives. However, the puppet side's representatives have not yet been determined, so it can only be said that they are preparing for negotiations. It seems premature to say that an agreement has already been reached. However, the court issue concerns China's sovereignty. The Chinese government successively recovered the legal rights of the two concessions in 1930 and 1931, which are related to agreements with six countries: the United Kingdom, the United States, France, the Netherlands, Norway, and Brazil. This cannot be violated by any country. The puppet "government" has not been recognized by the authorities of the two concessions, so it cannot become a negotiating partner. If one of the six countries does not agree, a small number of countries cannot negotiate separately with any party. Since the United States opposes Japan's unilateral actions in the Far East, and friendly nations and democratic countries recognize the independence and integrity of China's territorial sovereignty, we can confidently assert that none of the countries that participated in the recovery of the Provisional Court agreement would risk such a great transgression. Therefore, the Japanese side's claim that "the court issue will also be resolved soon" is merely an illusion.

Police Commissioner Knows Nothing About It

The Shanghai Times reports that the Japanese-language "Continental News" reported yesterday (the 1st) that the Shanghai Municipal Council and the "Shanghai Municipal Government" have recently reached an agreement on the establishment of a special police force in the western district. The reporter asked Police Commissioner Major Bowen of the Shanghai Municipal Council about this last night. He replied that he knew nothing about the establishment of the special police bureau having been finally agreed upon, because the negotiations between the police department and the "Municipal Police Department" are still in progress. According to the news published by the "Continental News," the Shanghai Municipal Council and the "Municipal Government" authorities have recently reached an agreement on the establishment of a special police bureau and six branch bureaus in the western district after a month of negotiations. The new police officers of the bureau will first order all gambling dens in the lawless area to close.

### Relief For Ningbo's Food Shortage; Concrete Measures Planned By Shanghai Fellow-Provincials Association; Sent Letter To Ningbo For Review

Recently, the problem of the Ningbo rice shortage has become serious. After repeated calls and appeals from various agencies and organizations in Ningbo, the Fellow-Provincials Association invited Ningbo natives in Shanghai and leaders from all walks of life to hold meetings to raise large sums of money, order foreign rice, transport it to Ningbo, and organize price stabilization sales to help the fellow villagers. Specific measures were drafted and sent to Ningbo for review a few days ago. The measures are recorded as follows: (1) A special committee will be formed, with members appointed by both Shanghai and Ningbo to cooperate; (2) The standard for ordering foreign rice is 100,000 bags, and the average selling price is assumed to be 30 yuan per market stone. It is estimated that each bag will lose 15 to 20 yuan, with a total loss of 2 million yuan; (3) Shanghai will be responsible for raising one-third of the total amount, i.e., more than 1.333 million yuan. The first batch of 50,000 bags will require raising more than 666,000 yuan. More than 520,000 yuan has already been advanced, leaving a shortage of 140,000 yuan, which can be paid at any time. The remaining half will be paid when the second batch of 50,000 bags is processed, without a fixed deadline; (4) The funds for purchasing rice should be raised by Ningbo, and the proceeds from the sale of rice will also be collected by Ningbo; (5) The funds for purchasing rice should be submitted to the ministry for free remittance. The tax exemption for the import of foreign rice and hemp bags should be handled in accordance with the original plan approved by the Sanbei Price Stabilization Association; (6) This price stabilization rice will begin with 18,000 bags of rice shipped from Hong Kong by the Grant Line, and will continue until 100,000 bags have been processed. It will also be clearly distinguished from the previous efforts of the Ningbo Food Company and the People's Food Relief Association; (7) The selling price of the hemp bags will be offset against the losses, with the proportion shared by both parties; (8) Except for Cibei and Zhenbei, which are already being handled by the Sanbei Price Stabilization Association, the price stabilization sales in Yin County, Cixiao, Fenghua, and Tiehai counties will be handled by the county magistrates, who will discuss and distribute rice equally.

### Sanbei Price Stabilization Loan Of 450,000 Yuan; Approved By The Four Banks

Yu Zhijie initiated the Sanbei hometown price stabilization, pledging private property worth one million yuan as a price stabilization fund to order 200,000 bags of foreign rice. Still feeling insufficient, he telegraphed the chairman of the Shanghai branch of the Bank of China, Communications Bank, Bank of Agriculture and Commerce and the Four Banks, requesting to serve as the price stabilization fund of 450,000 yuan. The office has now been ordered and approved to reply to the Shanghai branch for borrowing.

### Wenzhou Navigation Not Disrupted; Although The Port Is Blockaded, It Is Still Possible To Find A Way In

Wenzhou navigation has been obstructed by Japanese warships, which is a common occurrence since the opening of navigation. Recently, the Japanese Navy issued a warning to the British and American consulates, stating that "if ships of third countries sailing to Wenzhou do not comply with the orders of the Japanese Navy, they will take necessary measures." After that, foreign shipping suffered a severe blow. For example, the Yi Hua foreign company's "Binli" ship was blocked and ran aground, the Portuguese merchant ship "Minhe" and the German merchant ship "Hanna" were unable to enter and returned to Shanghai, and the German merchant ship "Feikanglun" was blocked outside the Oujiang River estuary. Almost no ship was spared from obstruction. However, in order to maintain navigation, the ships continued to operate. During the past week, the situation eased slightly because the Japanese warships outside the Oujiang River estuary had been ordered to sail elsewhere. Therefore, all ships sailing to Wenzhou were able to enter the port. However, it is known that most of the ships entered the Oujiang River at night to avoid being seen by the Japanese warships. Currently, there are a total of fourteen foreign ships operating on the Shanghai-Wenzhou line. More than ten ships are currently unloading cargo in Wenzhou and will continue to return to Shanghai this week. As for the Japanese warships firing on foreign ships outside the Oujiang River estuary, it has happened more than once. Sometimes they fire blank shots to intimidate, and sometimes they use machine guns to strafe aimlessly. The foreign ships are deeply indignant at this deliberate obstruction of navigation. The Japanese side prevents foreign ships from sailing to Wenzhou, claiming that the Oujiang River has been blockaded by the Japanese Navy with mines, and there are many dangers for ships entering the port. Therefore, the so-called ships of third countries must comply with the orders of the Japanese Navy, that is, they are prohibited from entering the blockade line. However, the foreign ships believe that this method is a fundamental prohibition of navigation and should not be followed hastily. Therefore, the ships continue to operate as usual.

### British, French, and Italian Liners Sail to Shanghai As Usual

A French liner from Marseille, which arrived in the Far East at the end of April, was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 1st of this month after arriving in Hong Kong last week. Due to delays en route, the journey from Hong Kong to Shanghai was delayed by two days. According to company news, the ship will arrive in port today and berth at the Bund's Shuntai Wharf. This ship's journey from Europe to Shanghai took more than a month, which is unprecedented. In addition, the voyage of British ships sailing to the Far East has also been extended since the British government ordered them to change course and sail around the Cape of Good Hope in Africa. One of the Changxing Company's ships, the Empress of Russia, will arrive in Shanghai today. After arriving in the Far East, the ship will still sail to Kobe and other ports in Japan as usual. The date of departure from Shanghai will be more than half a month later. The Italian Mail Boat Company's Conte Verde recently sailed from Europe to Shanghai without any obstruction along the way. After completing the loading and unloading of passengers and cargo in Shanghai, it will set sail from Shanghai to Europe at 8:00 AM on the 9th, passing through Hong Kong, Little Luzon, Singapore, Colombo, Bombay, and other ports to reach Genoa.

### Fire At Sijing Destroys Forty Or Fifty Stores; Estimated Loss Of 300,000 Yuan

Since the last fire in Sijing Town in western Shanghai, most of the destroyed houses have been rebuilt with simple thatched cottages. Fire prevention is extremely worrying. Unexpectedly, on the 26th of last month, a second major fire broke out due to the carelessness of a small worker repairing the water drain in the Tianzhang Sesame Cake Shop. Tianzhang Sesame Cake Shop is located east of Dongshi Bridge and west of Zhangjing Bridge in the town. It is one of the larger shops in the town and has a thriving business. Recently, due to damage to the eaves, workers were hired to repair it. At around 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 26th, the small worker repairing the water drain, Ma Yeqing (ten years old), accidentally overturned the stove onto the thatched roof next door, causing the burning charcoal fire to ignite the firewood. In an instant, it spread and burned. At that time, the southeast wind was blowing, and the wind helped the fire, making it unstoppable. Moreover, the streets there were narrow, and the neighbors on the left and right were also on fire. At the same time, it also affected the shops on the upper and lower banks. By the time the rescue efforts were made, it was already beyond control. It is estimated that a total of 34 shops on the upper and lower ponds, totaling 45 storefronts, were burned from the Pin Fang Photo Studio at the east end of Zhongshi Bridge to the Shao Dasheng South Goods Shop at the east end. The property loss is estimated to be 300,000 yuan. Yao Aju, who lived in the Xiehe Shunchou Silk Shop, was seriously ill and died on the spot from the shock.

### Police Chief Smith Did Not Return To England; Japan's Hope For His Departure Is Clearly Deliberate

Police Chief Smith of the Public Concession Shanghai Municipal Council has been performing his duties effectively and is highly regarded by the council. However, the Japanese side claimed that Smith was a reserve officer in the British military register. In mid-last month, it was rumored that he had been summoned back to his country. Later, seeing that Smith had no intention of leaving and was performing his duties as usual, it was suspected that the Shanghai Municipal Council had deliberately concealed the matter and was discussing with the British government to postpone Smith's recall to the military. Yesterday, the Japanese side's "Continental News" even said that the Shanghai Municipal Council was planning to retain Smith, or to reappoint a certain American, the former deputy director-general, and choose one of the two. It also said that if Smith joined the military, his vacancy should be filled by Police Chief Robertson of the Special Police Force or Deputy Director-General Akagi, who would serve concurrently. From this, we can see the Japanese side's intentions. However, according to inquiries by the reporter of the Dazhong News Agency from well-informed sources, it is said that there is no news about Smith being summoned.

### Amid Fluctuating Prices, Labor Disputes Arise Frequently

Although prices in this city have not fallen sharply due to the decline in gold prices and the appreciation of the exchange rate, some prices have continued to rise. The working class is still mostly in hardship, and labor disputes have arisen frequently. It is hoped that the capitalists will understand the plight of the employees and voluntarily increase wages appropriately, so that these people can work with peace of mind and avoid unnecessary losses. The details of the three labor disputes are recorded below:

Tofu Workers' Strike

After the tofu shop workers in this city began their work slowdown the day before yesterday, the labor and management have not yet reached a solution. Yesterday afternoon, the tofu shop workers in the western Shanghai area also joined the work slowdown. However, the work in each tofu shop is still proceeding as usual, because the number of workers hired in each tofu shop is small. After the work slowdown, their work can be handled concurrently by apprentices and family members of the shop owner. Therefore, each tofu shop can still deliver goods to the market. The Tofu Industry Association Management Committee announced yesterday the contents of the association's resolution to increase workers' wages, which are roughly as follows: "(1) Starting from the 15th of this month, wages will be increased by five cents per day; (2) In addition to the remaining amount of eight dou, two cents in legal tender will be added per dou; for more than twenty-four dou, the increase will be doubled." However, it is heard that the workers are demanding that the capitalists pay a monthly salary increase of 7.5 yuan, so the two sides have not been able to reach a satisfactory solution.

Bada Silk Factory

The Bada Silk Weaving Factory on North Henan Road has been slowing down work for ten days because the workers demanded that the factory increase wages by 50%, but did not get it. Although the Industrial and Commercial Section of the Shanghai Municipal Council sent personnel to mediate, it did not yield results. At 10:00 AM yesterday, the factory suddenly ordered the workers waiting in the factory for a solution to leave the factory, causing a conflict. At that time, two male workers were injured. One, Li Jingjin, 28, was sent to the Kaifeng Road Refugee Hospital for treatment. The other, Lu Lai, now all the male workers in the factory have been forced to leave the factory and live in the factory's workshop at No. 177 Jielu. Some of the female workers have left the factory and returned home. The striking workers, because their livelihoods have been cut off, are calling on their colleagues for relief and have been using the donated funds to cook two meals of porridge a day to fill their stomachs.

Jingxin Printing Bureau

The labor dispute at the Jingxin Printing Bureau on Glock Road in the French Concession has lasted for a week. While the capitalists have declared that they will dismiss the striking workers, they have also recruited new workers. It was learned yesterday that the factory has been scheduled to start work this morning. In addition to the newly hired workers, there are very few old workers who are allowed to enter the factory to work, because they still insist on demanding that the factory increase wages by 20 yuan per month.

### Japanese Warships Gather In Zhejiang Sea

According to reliable information from the shipping industry, Japanese warships have recently gathered in the Zhejiang Sea, seemingly with some kind of plan. Large Japanese warships and small Japanese cruisers have been anchored off the coast of Yantian and the estuary of the Oujiang River for many days and have not yet sailed away. Three Japanese transport ships are anchored off the coast of Dongshajiao, Daishan Island, Zhoushan Islands. A flagship and a destroyer are anchored in Dinghai Shitougang. Yamada, a senior commander of the Japanese war zone, landed there to reinforce the troops. Also, a Japanese warship is anchored in the Chuanshan Sea and cruises back and forth from time to time, with unclear intentions.

### Famous American Clergyman Calls For US Sanctions Against Japan; The Greatest Sufferers Are The Chinese; The US Should Stop Aiding And Abetting And Stop The Atrocities

The March issue of "The Catholic World" magazine, published in New York, published an article by the famous clergyman Rev. James M. Gillis criticizing the US policy on the Sino-Japanese War. The article stated that while Finland has been invaded and Poland has been ravaged, the greatest sufferers are actually the Chinese. In his opinion, the so-called crusaders for religious humanity, such as Britain and France, have failed to do their best to maintain justice, and the United States is also to blame. When Japan invaded the Northeast in 1931, the US authorities did make a weak protest, but since then they have claimed that Britain was unwilling to cooperate, so they did not take any action against Japan. This kind of defense is actually very hypocritical. We Americans are known as a people who pursue truth and cherish charity. We often pride ourselves on liberating South America, Cuba, and Puerto Rico from suffering.

Supplying Arms Is Tantamount To Aiding And Abetting

But the massacres of Japanese in China are ten thousand times more serious than in other countries, and we not only cannot stop these massacres, but also supply the Japanese with arms to massacre the Chinese. Our ideal humanitarian and charitable Congress is at this moment fussing over the difficulties and dangers of the United States intervening in the Sino-Japanese War. We do not need to stand up for the victims, but what we need to do is to stop aiding and abetting and stop encouraging aggression. New York is far from China and seems to have nothing to do with the war in China, but we are related to the massacre of millions of innocent Chinese. Why? Try to look at the huge amount of iron filings carried by the freight cars on the banks of the Jersey River, all of which are shipped to Japan. The iron materials after the railroad on Sixth Street is dismantled are also shipped to Japan.

American Arms Kill Chinese

When we see photos of the horrific scenes of Chinese houses and hospitals being bombed by Japanese planes in the newspapers every day, we must know that the bombs dropped by Japanese planes, as well as the bullets and tanks used by the Japanese army, are all made from American raw materials, and may even be manufactured in American factories. We are purely using economic tactics to pressure Japan to submit. The arrogant little Japan may take intimidating actions against us. However, we must know that the Chinese are still fighting bravely against Japan to this day. Can we Americans not resist the attacks of the Japanese Navy? If so, we Americans will be reduced to a country below the tenth rate.

Distinguish Between What Is Important

Gillis further said in his article that some people advocate maintaining trade with Japan and are unwilling to damage friendship with Japan, which is completely wrong. Just imagine, which is more important, New York City lacking water sources or 400 million Chinese being massacred? It is very clear. Finally, Gillis said that Americans should no longer call themselves a charitable nation, and should pray to God to forgive their sins. In his opinion, he still firmly believes that the United States will be able to stop the massacres in China without causing war.

### German Ship "Lameris" Suddenly Holds Reception; German, Italian, and Japanese Residents Invited; British, French, and American Residents Did Not Attend

Since the expansion of the European War, the German ship "Ladous" in Shanghai has been docked on the Huangpu River and has not left the port. Unexpectedly, the ship suddenly sailed into the blockade line of the 16th Pier a few days ago and docked at the Gaochang Temple side of the Huangpu River. At 12:00 noon yesterday, the ship hosted a reception for German, Italian, and Japanese residents in Shanghai. The shipowner issued hundreds of invitations in advance. However, it is known that none of the British, French, and American residents in the city received invitations. Therefore, all the guests who arrived yesterday morning were more than 300 German, Italian, and Japanese residents, who were picked up by the Japanese ship "Chunjiang Maru" at the customs pier. It is heard that there were also five Chinese people who were invited. As for the meaning of the ship's sudden reception of residents from various countries, the general public considers it worthy of attention.

### Summer Ban On Cold Dishes

The Shanghai Municipal Council's Health Department believes that unclean raw and cold food in summer can easily cause the spread of infectious diseases. Therefore, since the year before last, it has mobilized restaurants, food shops, Western restaurants, kitchens, and rice shops in the district to stop using cold dishes in the summer to prevent epidemics. It has achieved great results in the past two years. The Deputy Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, He De Kui, specially summoned representatives of relevant industries a few days ago to discuss continuing the promotion. It was decided to continue to follow last year's precedent, and any dishes will not be allowed to use cold dishes during the four months of June, July, August, and September. The director of the Health Department will post notices in Chinese and English in relevant shops, saying that in order to prevent citizens' diseases, it was resolved the year before last that all cold foods and cold dishes should not be used in the summer, and should be changed to cooked foods and cooked dishes to avoid accidentally eating germs and suffering from dysentery, cholera, typhoid fever, and other diseases. Now that the weather is getting hotter, in order to prevent citizens' diseases and promote public health, it is appropriate to continue to handle the case according to the established plan.

### Portugal's 800th Anniversary of Founding Postponed to the 4th

### Enticing Women And Forcing Them To Become Prostitutes; Planned To Be Sent To The Shanghai Guangxi Guide Agency In Nanjing; The Police Discovered The Criminals And Arrested Them All

Tong Rende, a native of Ningbo, who previously opened the Xinming Guide Agency at No. 10 Fuxiang Lane, Yunnan Road, and Wu Jincheng, a native of Tongzhou, the manager, recently established the Shanghai Guangxi Guide Agency on Confucius Temple Street in Nanjing. Between May 22nd, they enticed ten women, Mao Aidi, Mao Juzhen, Li Qingmei, Li Qingli, Lu Di, Zhou Baiyun, Chen Cuihua, Wang Manna, Yuan Genbao, and a woman surnamed Wang, in room 21 of the Jiangxin Hotel at No. 40 North Shansi Road. They planned to take the fire truck to the newly opened Shanghai Guangxi Guide Agency in Nanjing at 5:00 AM the next morning to engage in a cheap business for profit. The case was discovered by the Chinese detectives Wu De Kui and Hao Shangqin, and detective Xu Decheng of the Gordon Road Police Station secretly went to the address and arrested the two defendants, Tong and Wu, along with the suspects Zhu Yusheng from Danyang, Hong Honglai from Ningbo, Zhang Wei, a woman from Yangzhou, Zhu Sun, a woman from Tongzhou, and Mao Aidi, a woman from Shanghai. They sent more than a thousand people to the police station and sent them to a special court for interrogation and detention. The seduced women were temporarily sent to the Jiliang Institute for care. The case was recently reviewed by Judge Huang Risheng. The police lawyer Qian Xunjiu claimed that after investigating the suspects Zhu Yusheng, Hong Honglai, Zhang Wei, and Zhu Sun, they were all irrelevant and should be released. The court approved it. The mothers of the women Lu Didi and Li Qingmei, Lu Ye and Li Wang, came to the case and requested to take them back for discipline. Qian, the lawyer, requested that the remaining women be transferred to the Women and Children Relief Association and wait for their families to claim them. As a result, the court ordered that the case be rescheduled for further review. The women Lu Didi and Li Qingmei were allowed to be handed over to Lu Ye and Li Wang to take them back. The remaining seven women, Mao Aidi and Lu Shang, were specially sent to the Women and Children Relief Association. The two defendants, Tong Rende and Wu Jincheng, were still remanded in custody.

### The Adulterer Pushed And Stabbed His Husband; Sentenced To Seven Years Imprisonment

Yang Derong (32 years old), a native of Yangzhou, was still single. He recently had an affair with Sun, the wife of Cui Dengji, a fellow villager living in Yinghua Lane on Hart Road. Because her husband was working in the capital, Yang was responsible for the family expenses. On April 8, Cui Dengji suddenly returned to Shanghai, unaware that his wife Sun had an affair with Yang. That night, he still slept in the same bed. Yang was furious and went out to buy two sharp knives. At around 6:00 AM the next morning, without asking why, he slashed at Cui and his wife's heads, trying to take their lives. The case was discovered, and he was detained and sent to a special court. After the interrogation was concluded, Judge Jiang Shuzi presided over the trial yesterday and sentenced Yang Rongde to seven years in prison as a warning, and confiscated the two murder weapons.

### After the Arrest of Kidnappers, Another Lawsuit is Filed: Many Crimes Also Committed in the French Concession; The Case Must Be Investigated Thoroughly Before Further Action

The Chinese and Western detectives of the Public Concession's Jiaxing Road Police Station cracked a large-scale kidnapping operation at the Fuxinxiang Grocery Store, number 355 Zhuding Road, Hongkou, a few days ago. They arrested ten male and female kidnappers. It was found that these criminals had successively kidnapped no fewer than one hundred and fifty boys and girls, selling them to Xiamen, Fuzhou, and other places for profit. Many clothes, hats, shoes, socks, and photos of the kidnapped children were seized. They were sent to the First Special District Court for prosecution according to law. After the trial, the kidnappers Ling Rongsen, Ling Zhangshi, Dai Lushi, Wang Lishi, Wang Wushi, and Zhuge Shi were each sentenced to fifteen years in prison and fined 1,500 yuan. Cui Tengshi was sentenced to twelve years in prison and fined 800 yuan. Zhuge Chun and Lu Wenzhong were each sentenced to fourteen years in prison and fined 800 yuan. The above nine defendants were also deprived of public rights for ten years. Wang Zhangshi was found not guilty in the case. Subsequently, the French Concession Police found that the defendants had also committed similar kidnapping cases within the French Concession. They reported this to the Second Special District Court and requested that Detective Yan Jinwen be dispatched to the First Special District Court to bring the ten defendants back to the French Concession Police Station to be sent to the Second Special District Court for interrogation, detention, investigation, and review. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. On the morning of the previous day, Prosecutor Sun Pengxian attended the First Criminal Court for a continued trial. The police lawyer stated that it had been found that the defendants had committed more than one hundred cases within the French Concession, and that investigating the case would take a considerable amount of time. He requested that the date be postponed for two more weeks to thoroughly investigate the case and request a hearing. The court checked the records, questioned the defendants, and decided to postpone the hearing to the morning of the seventh. The defendants were all remanded in custody. Wang Zhangshi's request for bail was denied.

### The Yanqun Troupe's Successful Performance

The Postal Workers, in order to promote healthy entertainment and develop theatrical arts, specifically organized the Yanqun Drama Troupe, which has had a history of many years. In the past, they have performed one-act plays such as "The Mute Wife," achieving remarkable results. Recently, they revived a famous work by Molière, "The Miser," adapted by Gu Zhongyi, as a five-act satirical comedy, directed by Hu Daozuo, and performed it at the Lafayette Garden Theater yesterday morning at ten o'clock. The audience was full. The play depicts Fan Yunsheng's son, Li Han, who, because of his love for the miser Hua Binggang's daughter, Hua Yingmei, goes by the name Zhang Yongqing to become Hua Binggang's volunteer accountant, so that he can be close to Yingmei. The two secretly get engaged. Hua Binggang's son, Yingde, is in love with Fan Yunsheng's daughter, Fan Liqiong, but Hua Binggang also likes Liqiong. Through the enthusiastic matchmaking of the go-between, Chuan Er Niangzi, Liqiong, due to her mother's difficult life, is forced to agree to become Binggang's second wife. Binggang arranges for Yingde to marry a widow, and promises Yingmei to Fan Yunsheng, because Fan Laoxiansheng is wealthy and does not want his dowry. Thus, the father and son fight for love, and the relationships are reversed. The two sons' lovers are about to marry their respective fathers as second wives. In the end, Yingde, Liqiong, Li Han, and Yingmei, the two young lovers, are able to break the deadlock and all become couples. The plot is tight, and the performance is vivid and colorful. Hu Daozuo's portrayal of the miser Hua Binggang is lifelike. Miss Ding Xiang's Hua Yingmei, Chen Zhitong's Fan Li Han, Si Bing's Hua Yingde, and Shen Mo's Chuan Er Niangzi all have a great talent for acting and a promising future.

### The United Education Association Issues a Letter to the Education Community on the Anti-Smoking Day: Expanding the Meaning of Anti-Smoking and Strictly Preventing Invisible Poisons

(Da Guang News Agency) The Shanghai Education Community United Association, for the June 3rd Anti-Smoking Memorial Day, issued a statement to the education community in this city, stating briefly: "Today is the June 3rd Anti-Smoking Memorial Day, and it is also the year that the six-year anti-smoking plan expires. We know that swallowing red pills and smoking opium can all damage our bodies, hinder our health, poison our minds, ruin our future, and destroy our entire race. These terrible consequences truly make people tremble with fear.

Lin Gong Zexu, with foresight and vision, on this day a hundred years ago, with a great spirit of fearlessness, burned more than 20,000 boxes of opium completely. Although Lin Zexu was dismissed and punished for this, and suffered a painful failure, the harm of opium is undeniable, and Lin Zexu's greatness cannot be denied by anyone. Since the Republic of China, although there have been discussions about banning smoking, they have been mere empty words. Only our Chairman Chiang is wise and decisive, designating June 3rd as Anti-Smoking Memorial Day and

Setting a Deadline for Elimination

This year happens to be the year the six-year anti-smoking plan expires. But since the National Army withdrew westward, some people have recklessly transported various drugs to the occupied areas, poisoning our compatriots and destroying our nearly completed plan. On the one hand, they are also implementing invisible poisons, harming the minds of our people. Their poison is actually even worse than opium. The general shameless people, blinded by greed,

Suffer from its poison without knowing it, which is especially heartbreaking. Therefore, the significance of commemorating Anti-Smoking Day today is not only in quitting tangible opium, but also in expanding its meaning, emulating Lin Zexu's indomitable spirit, supporting the Central Government, obeying the President, and crushing the conspiracies of these people. The responsibility of our education community is not only to cultivate talent, but also to transform customs and set an example for society. We should be in a position of foresight and awareness, starting with ourselves, so that we can extend it to others, and all poisons will be swept away cleanly."

### International Cup Mini-Football: China and England Both Qualify for the Finals; Yesterday, They Eliminated France and Portugal Respectively; The Championship Will Be Decided This Saturday Afternoon

The semi-finals of the International Cup Mini-Football were held at the Aurora Stadium at 3:30 PM yesterday. In the first match, England defeated Portugal 3-0. However, Portugal's offense was very strong, and Fafan Xiao missed more than ten shots on goal. Otherwise, the outcome would have been difficult to determine. In the other match, China led all the way against France. In the first half, China was ahead 2-0. France was at a loss. China scored two more goals, and eliminated France 4-1 to secure a place in the finals with England. The battle situation is as follows:

### The Chinese Team Eliminates France

In the match between China and France, Zheng Tongyu, the goalkeeper of the Chinese team, was unable to play, and was replaced by Fan Jinyong of the Ge Lian team. Captain Sun led the front line, with Shen Jinda and Gao Baozheng serving as left and right forwards. The defenders were still Feng and Meng. The lineup was fairly complete. The French team, under the leadership of veteran Baoti Tuokelai, and with the help of French businessman Bakerlai, was not weak either. After the kickoff, China took the offensive. "Iron Leg" passed to Baozheng, whose shot was blocked, but he scored on a second shot. Before long, Sun "Iron Leg" made a comeback, passing left to Shen Jinda. The defender rushed out too quickly, and Shen sent the ball into the empty net to open the scoring. The French team, after losing a goal, brought in Hailayang to replace Xin Liu. Sure enough, soon after, Hailayang dribbled forward and passed to Kelai, Kelai shot and Shou was unable to save it, and a goal was lost, making it a 1-1 tie. The first half ended. After the break, the Chinese team's lineup changed slightly, with Chen Yuanji replacing Shen Jinda to increase the offense. After ten minutes, Luo Su accidentally handled the ball with his hand. Fortunately, it was far from the goal, and "Iron Leg" kicked it into the net, again giving China the advantage. Not three minutes later, Wen's was called for a personal foul. "Iron Leg" took the penalty again, which Levi received but then lost, making it 3-1. The Chinese team had an absolute advantage. The French army's actions seemed rather crude. Unfortunately, their luck was bad and they were unable to score. After twenty-two minutes, Gao Baozheng passed to Sun Jinshun, who passed the defender and went in, making it 4-1, sealing the victory. Two minutes before the end, Chen Yuanji of the Chinese team and Wen's, a defender of the French army, had a misunderstanding while fighting for the ball, and the two sides got into a fight. The game was interrupted as a result. Both sides were ruled out of the game. The game ended quickly, with China eliminating France 4-1.

### England Loses to Portugal

In the England-Portugal match, the entire English team consisted of Dong Selai players, with excellent coordination. The Portuguese team's luck was poor. They had more than ten scoring opportunities, but they were all blocked by the English goalkeeper Maurice, who made many saves, earning much applause. In the first half, the English army's goal was scored by Jin Selai, taking a 1-0 lead. After switching sides, the Portuguese team's offense did not weaken, but they were still unable to break the duck egg record. On the contrary, they were scored on twice from afar by the English army's substitute, James Watt, resulting in a 3-0 loss, with the English army being eliminated.

Taifeng Transportation Company Sues Wu Linsen for Fraud: The Plaintiff Claims Repayment of 22,000 Yuan; The Defendant Fails to Appear, the Case is Postponed

Taifeng Transportation Company at number 20, Sijing Road, last December, due to transporting more than 3,000 pieces of cotton purchased by Defeng Spinning Factory, You Hengyuan Tai, and other companies in Jiangbei Dazhongji, believed that due to the special wartime situation at various tax checkpoints along the way, taxes could not be declared according to the usual peacetime regulations. It was necessary to find someone who had relationships with the Japanese army and guerrillas to handle it. Wu Linsen, who claimed to be the "Manager of the American Company," contacted Gao Xingwu, the manager of Taifeng Company. Wu claimed that he had real connections with the upstream guerrilla teams and the Yangtze River Japanese Army transportation management unit. He said that the company had branch offices in Taixian upstream and other ports, and that all goods transported from these places to Shanghai could have all kinds of miscellaneous fees and taxes handled and

Funds Advanced. Only after the goods arrived in the Shanghai concessions would the company come to collect the money, etc. At that time, Gao believed it to be true and did not suspect anything else. He then negotiated with Wu, agreeing that the goods would be transported from the port to the Shanghai concessions for delivery, with a fee of 42 yuan per piece of cotton, including all taxes and fees along the way. When Taifeng Company's cotton was transported from Dazhongji to the port, and was about to be handed over to Wu for shipment to Shanghai, Wu suddenly came to Taifeng Company and told Gao that the current situation was

Special, and that he must pay in advance. Gao, based on the agreement, refused to pay in advance. However, Wu repeatedly said that he must, so Gao handed over 21,000 yuan to Wu. Unexpectedly, after Wu received the money, he disappeared and could not be seen. All the offices were also closed. At this point, Gao realized that he had been deceived. Recently, Gao finally found out where Wu was hiding, and hired lawyer Zhang Danping to represent him. He filed a complaint with the Criminal Court of the First Special District Court, accusing Wu of fraud under Article 339 of the Criminal Law, and attached a civil lawsuit, requesting compensation of 11,000 yuan. The court approved the complaint. The previous day, Judge Zhong opened the Civil Court 8 for trial. The defendant avoided appearing, and entrusted lawyer Cai Lin to defend him. After the plaintiff's statement was recorded, the court stated that criminal defendants must appear in person. If they use excuses not to appear, the court will consider the situation and take them into custody. Therefore, the hearing was postponed to the 8th of this month.

### How to Promote Foreign Trade

A Summary of the Minutes of a Symposium Held in Cooperation with the Economic Research Department of the Universal Trust Company

In these wartime times, although our country's foreign trade environment is challenging, its significance and hope are actually greater than in peacetime. The outbreak of the European war is even more beneficial to exports. However, overcoming the environment requires our efforts; and opportunities that arise should also be rationally utilized. Moreover, stabilizing the exchange rate, balancing prices, adjusting the supply and demand of materials, strengthening the war economy, and improving the national economy and people's livelihood are all related to this. At the last symposium of this publication, Mr. Wang Haibo believed that in addition to cracking down on speculation, we should also guide idle capital to legitimate outlets. Engaging in import and export business is also a worthwhile outlet for funds to be studied. Mr. Wang Haibo is one of the few domestic economists who has become an import and export entrepreneur. He is full of knowledge and experience and is very interested in this. Therefore, the Economic Research Department of the American Universal Trust Company, under his leadership, initiated a collaboration with this publication to invite government officials, merchants, bankers, national goods industrialists, and economists with special research on international trade in this city to hold a joint symposium in order to gather ideas and conduct academic discussions. We are deeply honored to have received the presence of various predecessors in person or through representatives, who shared their insightful opinions. We are also deeply grateful for the support and cooperation of Mr. Wang Haibo and the Economic Research Department of the Universal Trust Company under his leadership in preparing and conducting this symposium.

However, due to the limited position of this publication, we can only provide a summary of the key points of the insightful opinions expressed by all attendees. We are grateful for your personal revisions, which allow us to retain the essence. We are especially fortunate that this issue will contain the first part, and the next issue will continue to complete it. It is said that the "Daily Economic Monthly," edited by Mr. Wang Haibo, will publish a special issue on foreign trade in July of this year, from which the whole picture can be seen, which readers will be happy to hear.

Date: May 12, 29th year [of the Republic], from 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM

Location: 5th Floor Hall, Bank Association, No. 59 Hong Kong Road

Chairman: Mr. Wang Haibo Stenographer: Mr. Shen Wenbin

Attendees: (Signatures not in order)

Opening Remarks

Chairman: ... The motivation for today's meeting stems from the belief, expressed during the "Shanghai Market Self-Management" symposium of the Shen Bao Economic Special Issue, that the total amount of idle capital in Shanghai is at least 300 million; and that this idle capital is all engaged in speculative activities such as hoarding goods and purchasing gold and foreign exchange. It is very difficult to manage this, because the purpose of speculation is nothing more than to make money; and it is ineffective to persuade them with passive moral methods. Therefore, at that time, I proposed guiding idle capital to legitimate outlets; if idle capital can find legitimate outlets, it may not blindly follow. I also believe that one of the outlets for idle capital is to engage in import and export business. However, import and export business is by no means as simple as speculating in foreign exchange and gold; anyone can act blindly. Promoting international trade, in terms of exports, aims to obtain foreign exchange and strengthen national power; in terms of imports, how to exchange for daily necessities and essential raw materials for domestic goods manufacturing in the most economical way. Now that the situation in Europe is urgent, and Italy and the United States may join the war, the source of foreign goods is even more threatened. Therefore, in our import statements, we must also seize the opportunity to actively imitate and manufacture in order to revitalize our country's industry. All of this is inextricably linked to production technology, financial turnover, transportation issues, and overseas markets. It is imperative that people with status and knowledge in society, as well as leaders in various industries, come forward to promote and lead, and point out a bright path; so that a group of people can follow suit and move forward together. Today's attendees are all economic experts and leaders in various industries; it is hoped that through different perspectives, some good methods can be discussed. This is not only a benefit to the industrial and commercial sectors, but also a great contribution to the national economy and people's livelihood.

International Trade and the National Economy

Chairman: Since May 2nd, the exchange rate has plummeted again, causing changes in prices and various economic sectors. Also, according to yesterday's newspaper, the figures released by the foreign exchange authority show that 90% of our country's foreign exchange is used for international trade. Although this does not mean that exchange rate fluctuations are directly due to international trade, no one can deny the significant relationship between the two. According to various newspapers, our country's international trade in the first quarter of this year showed a surplus; but this is based on the official exchange rate. If calculated at the black market exchange rate, the trade deficit is truly alarming. What is the impact of this on the national economy? Are there any remedial measures? Let's discuss this.

Lu Zhixue: The customs report shows a surplus, but calculated at the market exchange rate, it is a deficit.

Zhang Yifan: The balance of international payments should be calculated based on the black market rate. Commodity trade should be calculated based on the legal exchange rate in order to deduct the impact of prices and study the true state of supply and demand.

Yao Qingzhi (Chairman): Everyone, I would like to make an opening statement before discussing this topic; I find today's topic of discussion very interesting. In the past ten years, China's economic thought has been partly influenced by Soviet socialism and partly by German fascism. The general public hopes for self-sufficiency in international trade. This idea of self-sufficiency is worth promoting in wartime, but it is unacceptable in peacetime. We know that international trade is, in principle, nothing more than international division of labor and cooperation, and mutual exchange. Therefore, if countries can truly engage in reasonable transactions under conditions of equality and mutual benefit, it will be beneficial and harmless to both parties. Why does Europe have to go to war? Is it impossible to solve the problem without war? This is worth our attention. Why did Germany create this European war? The underlying reasons are nothing more than to seize markets and compete for raw materials. However, if surplus production has an international market for public sales, and if raw materials are lacking, they can also be purchased from the international market. Then Germany, at least economically, has no need to engage in aggression. As for Britain and France, they have colonies, raw materials are easy to buy, and products are easy to sell, so they naturally feel satisfied. However, since the Ottawa Imperial Conference, Britain has implemented preferential tariffs for various parts of the British Empire; France has also implemented the same policy since the economic crisis. This makes it difficult for goods from other countries to compete with British and French goods within the colonies of the British and French Empires, and they also lack purchasing power to purchase the required raw materials within the colonies of the British and French Empires. In this regard, Britain and France are also to blame for the long-term cause of this European war. In short, if countries can adopt a more liberal attitude in their trade policies, it is the best basis for international peace. In recent years, U.S. Secretary of State Hull has vigorously promoted reciprocal trade agreements, and President Roosevelt has recently advocated that economic reconstruction after the war should be based on liberal trade policies. The essence of this is also here. Therefore, I believe that international trade should adopt a more liberal approach in peacetime; economic self-sufficiency should be promoted in wartime, but it is impossible in peacetime. Even if it is forced, it will be at a great sacrifice. For example, Germany ignores natural rubber and engages in artificial rubber, and its cost is more expensive than the original. This is the general situation. Regarding the result of international trade, it is also worth exploring whether a trade deficit is unacceptable. I think this point should also be discussed separately. If the reason for this trade deficit is to use foreign capital for national economic development, then it does not matter, because the inflow of foreign capital is tantamount to a surplus in intangible trade; if it can offset the deficit in tangible trade, then the balance of international payments can still be balanced, and the exchange rate can still be stabilized. Therefore, under such circumstances, a trade deficit is not a problem at all. However, this is not the case in Shanghai under the current environment, because the trade deficit in tangible trade is not only not offset by the inflow of foreign capital, but is exacerbated by the flight of capital, which greatly threatens the stability of the exchange rate. This is a very dangerous phenomenon.

The outbreak of the Second European War has brought about tremendous changes in our country's national tribute trade; in the past, Germany ranked third in our country's total imports, but since the outbreak of the European War, there have been very few imports; especially machinery and various chemicals are simply not available. In addition, imports of goods from Britain, France, and other European belligerent or neutral countries have also gradually decreased; therefore, we have to change our route and import from the United States. As for exports, due to the fall in the exchange rate of the legal currency, they have increased instead. The sales of domestic goods in the Nanyang area have made significant progress. Not only is this the case in Nanyang, but it has also expanded to India; such as cotton yarn, cotton cloth, undershirts, handkerchiefs, socks, and the like, the sales volume is very considerable. Our country's rubber overshoes have even been sold to Britain and France, which is a groundbreaking record in the history of exports. These are all very favorable phenomena.

In this process, there is also a characteristic that is worth our attention; that is, in the past, our country's international trade has always been controlled by foreigners; the reason for this is that the Chinese people are not familiar with foreign conditions, so this is not only the case for imports, but also for exports. However, this is now slowly shifting to the hands of the Chinese people. The number of Chinese firms engaged in import and export is increasing day by day. This is a very good opportunity to make the right of international trade belong to ourselves, because if we want to buy German pigments, the internal situation cannot be more detailed than that of German merchants with a long history. Now that German goods cannot come, we have to buy from the United States; we are indeed laymen, but foreign merchants are also laymen like us; we can compete with them. This is an improvement in imports due to changes in the international environment; the situation is naturally the same for exports. Therefore, at this time, there are many benefits in the international trade mechanism. Mr. Wang Haibo is not only a theorist, but also a practitioner; I hope that Mr. Wang will lead and promote so that all import and export businesses can be controlled by the Chinese people.

Lu Zhixue: This problem should be discussed in two points. Shanghai and the mainland cannot be generalized... If we drastically reduce the things we use ourselves, we can definitely turn the trade deficit into a trade surplus. But the problem of Shanghai's trade deficit is difficult to solve because most of the things we use rely on foreign sources. For example, the raw material tallow for the Huan Factory Solid Soap used to be purchased from Qingdao, Bengbu, and other places, and foreign goods were never used. Now, because these places have fallen, we have to buy from Australia; we must use foreign exchange. In the past, tallow was 13-14 yuan per ton, but recently it has reached more than 90 yuan. Another example is that rosin must be bought from the United States. Wooden box boards used to come from Wenzhou and Hangzhou, and the price was very cheap; now that there are few imports, the price is also expensive. Although prices in the mainland are expensive, raw materials are available everywhere; therefore, it is easier to increase production and adjust trade than in Shanghai. Mr. Yao said that the policy of "self-sufficiency" is impossible. I have some objections, because in the present, if we are not self-sufficient, there will be more difficulties. If we force it, it will certainly not be economical, but for the sake of the country, the things that must be needed, we must buy what we must buy, and make what we can make, regardless of the price or the manufacturing cost...

Our Country's Current Trade Environment

Chairman: Now our country and Europe are in a period of war, and in the future, the Mediterranean, the Indian Ocean, and the Pacific Ocean may be involved in the whirlpool at any time. International trade in wartime naturally has many special circumstances. At present, the two major problems that import and export merchants feel most severely are foreign exchange and transportation. Fluctuations in foreign exchange cause risks to arise. Transportation blockages and shortages of cabin space further hinder cargo transportation. Under the circumstances of internal and external wars, how can our country's international trade be maintained, and how can it be maintained? Please express your valuable opinions.

Yu Zhongkui: According to the current situation, there is really no way; so it is difficult to discuss.

Zhang Yifan: When the European War just started, people were very panicked, thinking that Europe and the United States would withdraw from the Far East market; and that there would be no ships to transport import and export goods; in addition, they were all in the hands of the Japanese. Later, when the war was not tense, various countries were relieved that trade with China was as usual. Recently, there has been talk of Britain and France only going around the Cape of Good Hope, and panic has risen again. In fact, after the expansion of the European War, is it really impossible to reach China? This depends on whether they can be self-sufficient? In fact, they must come to China to buy raw materials, so it will not be impossible to come. This is certainly not a real solution, but it is clear that trade and transportation can be maintained.

Li Zufan: Because foreign countries need China's raw materials, even if the European War expands again, ships will still come, but the reduction in capacity is inevitable, so it will affect the source of cheap and bulky things. In other words, expensive and small things may still be able to maintain transportation, but cheap and bulky things will have problems. For example, "coal" used to be only ten to dozens of yuan per ton, but after the outbreak of the European war, the price immediately rose, but the producing place, such as India, still only sells for nine rupees, while the freight costs five or six times. In the past, "coal" was a very small problem for various factories, but now it is considered absolutely serious. Europe and the United States need our raw materials, so ships will definitely come, but China, in addition to the supply of minerals and vegetable oils, still needs more from others. The reason why American ships are unwilling to increase their voyages to the Far East is also because there is more cargo coming than going, which cannot be balanced. This will be a very serious problem in the future. The main raw material alkali for chemical industries such as soap making is supplied by the ICI (Imperial Chemical Industries) Company, but since the recent sudden change in the European war and the danger in the Mediterranean, they have refused to sell because there is no doubt that the future source will be lacking, and British ships have to detour around the Cape of Good Hope. In this way, the time is extended and the freight increases, so there must be many similar problems. The supply of raw materials is now a major problem. In addition to the transportation problem, the unstable exchange rate makes it impossible to calculate the cost of international trade at all, because a batch of orders takes at least two or three months, and it is impossible to estimate the extent of its changes during this period. For example, the flour used by our factory used to come from Canada for a period of time. Later, because the foreign exchange was expensive, we switched to using Chinese goods—the quality was slightly worse—once, the foreign exchange was loose and the domestic goods were not enough, so we went to buy from foreign countries again, but when it arrived, the market price was already different. Although our factory settled the foreign exchange early, there was no problem, but the instability of the foreign exchange is indeed one of the biggest obstacles to international trade.

Wu Yugan: Regarding the transportation problem, in addition to "ships," I think there are more difficult and serious problems. Before the war, Shanghai was the center of China's international trade. After the withdrawal of the national army to the west, the ports of Guangzhou Bay, Haiphong, and Wenzhou became international roads, and Hong Kong became the trade center. Later, due to the once tense relations between Britain and Japan, there was talk of a blockade of Hong Kong. Later, because the situation gradually eased, there was no change, but it is difficult to predict the future. Therefore, it is not a question of whether "ships" will come or not. We know that there are two other international routes in the southwest and northwest, but the actual situation of cargo transportation cannot be determined. I hope that those from the mainland will report some of the information they know.

Zhang Yifan: Assuming that transportation becomes a problem, the industrial and commercial sectors will indeed have difficulties. The government always has more ways than private individuals, so it is better to hand over the export business to the state for operation, which will be more convenient than private individuals handling it alone.

Promoting Trade and Finance

Chairman: The financial sector is closely related to import and export trade; this is true in peacetime, and even more so in times of crisis. How should the financial sector assist traders to benefit both the public and private sectors? Let's discuss this.

Gan Dounan: The financial sector and the industrial sector must be united. There is not much contact between them now. The financial sector does not lend to manufacturers, but operates other businesses for two reasons: (1) credit is easy to investigate; (2) speculative businesses are more profitable. If this continues, it will not only be a disaster for the financial and industrial sectors, but also not a way to promote trade. I advocate that the banking industry should unite to assist the only remaining national industries. Suppose a factory receives an order worth 30,000 yuan, but cannot accept it due to insufficient funds without the help of a bank, and will inevitably miss the opportunity. The financial sector may worry that someone will use the order to borrow money from several banks at the same time and use it for other purposes. The preventive method is for the financial sector to jointly organize a foreign trade registration office; its task is that when the industrial sector or exporters borrow money from the financial sector, they must first register with the office, and the office will issue a registration certificate, based on which they can borrow money from the financial sector; all those responsible in the office can only issue a registration certificate for the same order or bill of exchange once; and the financial sector can consult the registration office at any time, and the above-mentioned drawbacks may be eliminated invisibly.

Nie Guangdi: After receiving an export order, you should buy raw materials, otherwise, there is no danger in market fluctuations, so you need a sum of money. If the funds are not sufficient, you have to borrow money from the bank; if the bank is unwilling to lend, you can't do it; if you can't do it, you will have less foreign exchange... In the British colonies, they don't allow you to easily ship things there, the reason is nothing more than to maintain their own foreign exchange, so after receiving an order, we should first ask whether it can be imported? If it can be imported, we can think of cooperating with their corresponding banks in Shanghai, London, and other places, and rely on their strength to purchase raw materials. However, it is best to cooperate with Chinese commercial banks. Assuming that this can be done, foreign trade will definitely be much larger than it is now. Recently, two friends told me that foreign banks can lend money to those with good credit first, but not everyone can do it. We hope that Chinese commercial banks will do it themselves, especially for the help of exporters, which can enable our country to obtain more foreign exchange.

Commercial News

### Refined Silver Reduced by Five Jiao

Yesterday, the refined silver for jewelry was uniformly reduced by five jiao at the morning round spot. Da Tonghang quoted five yuan and five jiao, and Xin Tonghang quoted five yuan and four jiao. As for decorative gold, it remained flat. Da Tonghang and Xin Tonghang both quoted 620 yuan (30 yuan less for collection), it is said.

### British and French Exchange Rates Fall Again

A telegram from New York on the 2nd said that the British pound exchange rate fell again, resulting in a drop of 2.75 points. The opening was 3.225 yuan, the highest was 2.2275 yuan, the lowest reached 3.2075 yuan, and the closing was 3.21 yuan. The French franc exchange rate also fell by 1.25 points, to 1.82 yuan.

### Indian Silver Reacts in Shanghai

A telegram from Bombay on the 2nd said that the Indian silver market was firm. As a result, spot prices all rose by 14 annas. A total of 200 transactions were completed. The British and American silver markets were closed for the weekend as usual.

### Wuxi New Wheat Enters the Market Spring Cocoon Prices Too High Small Cocoon Shops Have Stopped Weighing

The Wuxi Rice Market has been short of rice boats recently due to the spring cocoons entering the market, and the inventory has been gradually reduced. Some shops have successively replenished their stocks in the market and sold them in separate packages. The market price is firm. High-quality white japonica rice is 33.2 yuan per stone, white japonica rice for retail is 32 yuan, high-quality brown rice is 10 yuan, high-quality japonica rice is 15.3 yuan per dan, white rice is 31 yuan per stone, and Yuan rice is 15 yuan. There is very little Yangxian and Dazi rice. High-quality white Yangjian rice is 34-5 yuan per stone, and white Dazi rice also needs 33-4 yuan. The Xian rice market is smooth. It is hoped that the arrival of Wanlu Xian rice will ease the supply and the price will fall.

New wheat has entered the market in Xiyi. Old wheat will be extinct. However, there is no formal large market for new wheat. Small machine mills are trying to make it for 32-33 yuan per bag. After the silkworm season, most of them will be harvested and enter the market after the Dragon Boat Festival. The supply will inevitably surge. However, the bottom price this year is too high, making it difficult to start. New Yuan wheat from Nanjing is coming in steadily, at more than 21 yuan per stone, and the quality is still good. There is a limited amount of old flour. New flour will be available in about twenty days. It once rose to 13.67 yuan per bag, almost balancing with Shanghai flour. The number of flour mills has increased this year, and there will inevitably be differences in the market price of wheat and flour.

The weighing of spring cocoons in Xiyi has been going on for three or four days. Because there are too many small cocoon shops, they indiscriminately accept and release orders, resulting in a high price of 400 yuan per dan. The other day, some small cocoon shops temporarily stopped weighing. The "China Central Company" controlled various cocoon shops and also started to accept goods. Although the recent silk price has reached more than 5,000 yuan, cocoon merchants still have a bullish mentality. However, with the unpredictable changes in the European war and the major crisis in the future of silk prices, small cocoon shops have stopped accepting goods, also feeling that cocoon prices are too high and the future is dangerous. A certain cocoon shop in Nanxiang has collected more than 100,000 pieces, but has also stopped buying due to high costs. This year's cocoons are of very good quality due to the dry weather. Generally, the drying loss is only 280 catties, and the reeling loss can be within 400 catties. (Good)

### Golden Vegetables Are Tight Again

Golden needle vegetables were once seen loosening, but now, as the market has become more active, the price has turned tight. Yesterday, a Zhenbang shop opened a batch of Dayu vegetables at a price of 46 yuan, which was decided at 45 yuan. The market price also rose accordingly, and there are still signs of further tightening.

### Sugar Prices Show Mixed Fluctuations

Sugar prices showed mixed fluctuations, with small ups and downs. The association's opening price for spot goods was 71.5 yuan for No. 24 coarse white sugar in the main warehouse. The initial price for new foreign goods in foreign warehouses was 71 yuan to 70.9 yuan, but later it rose back to 71.2 yuan. Small triangle, old goods were 70.3 yuan to 70.5 yuan, transit goods were 57.5 yuan, then to 57.6 yuan to 57.7 yuan, and later even to 58 yuan, up by half a yuan. Taikoo white B mark was 82.5 yuan, small five jiao, HX mark was 81.5 yuan, and the prices of car red and red lotus remained unchanged. The local factory's snow white was 72 yuan, and the wood ice was slightly looser than before, with No. 1 at 92.5 yuan, No. 2 at 92 yuan, and crystal clear ice at 94 yuan.

### White Coal Sales Decline

Although the white coal business is in the summer season, sales are gradually declining, but there are many ships arriving with goods, and customer orders are still coming in an endless stream. Yesterday, a certain company arrived with more than 360 tons of Tongdeli white coal, which has already been unloaded and put on the wharf. Fellow traders still opened at the old price of 210 yuan, but the goods in the hands of hoarders can be 7-8 jiao cheaper than the market price. The door shops on this street deliver to customers at 200 yuan per ton, including the carrying fee.

### The Shift in the Sales of Broadcloth

— Feng

The Shanghai broadcloth market is undoubtedly the central hub of the entire country. Merchants from all regions and routes invariably come to Shanghai for business. Examining the sales of broadcloth, there have been significant changes from the past to the present. Starting from the fifth year of the Republic [1916], merchants from various parts of South and North China came to Shanghai one after another to establish firms and purchase broadcloth. Around the seventh and eighth years of the Republic [1918-1919], the sales of broadcloth became even more prosperous, and the number of merchants and firms established in Shanghai increased. The North China merchants (including those from Manchuria) were the most active in purchasing, and their firms were mostly located at Yi Shun Heng, Yi Shun Sheng, Yong Feng, Shi Yi Tang, etc. The South China merchants mostly set up shop within the Guangdong, Ji, and Chao firms. The Guangdong merchants came to Shanghai mainly to purchase woolen cloth and mostly resided in the Hongkou Tiantong area (commonly known as Guangdong Street), often within general fruit stores. They mostly sold bananas and sugarcane to purchase broadcloth for return to Guangdong, and the business was substantial. The Shantou and Xiamen merchants mostly purchased mixed broadcloth and “lanhu” broadcloth. The firms of the Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan merchants mostly gathered in Da Chuan Tong, Tai Gu Yu, Yi He Yu, Zhao Shang Yu, Ji Xing, Hui Ji Xing, Xiang Yu Gong, and Yi Ji Zhan, etc. The Changsha merchants mostly gathered between Xiang Yi Gong and the Changsha Commercial Guild. Other merchants from places such as Peiping, Tianjin, Qingdao, Yantai, Hankou, Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, Jiangxi, Nanchang, Xi'an, and Dalian, were mostly associated with commercial guilds if they were run by northerners, and those run by southerners mostly operated within well-known Shanghai firms. However, among these northern and southern merchants, many rented houses in alleys such as Taiping Fang, Weishui Fang, Ju Fang, Jinghe Li, and Taozhu Li. (To be continued)

Securities: New York Stocks

A dispatch from New York on the 2nd: The stock market today experienced mixed trading with a slight decline. Trading was quiet, primarily due to many speculators in the financial district still being on holiday, awaiting the decision on Italy's entry into the war. The declines in stocks were mostly minor. Although the steel industry's operating rate is expected to increase next week, steel stocks also declined. Copper stocks, however, were supported by expectations of war orders. The Federal Reserve Board announced a decrease of $53 million in broker loans, totaling a decrease of $108 million over the past two weeks. This reflects the recent unloading of positions by weak bulls and indicates that stocks are now held by strong hands.

Rubber

A dispatch from New York on the 2nd: Rubber prices rose due to increased insurance premiums and concerns about the situation in the Dutch East Indies. Short covering reappeared, leading to a rise on Monday. The International Rubber Restriction Committee released its monthly statistics for April, showing a permitted net export of 103,813 tons, inventories of 21,183 tons, and 188,000 tons in transit at sea. Total absorption was 97,649 tons, and the net export from the Golden Ball was 113,047 tons.

Grains

A dispatch from Chicago on the 2nd: A private estimate for the wheat market projects a total production of 720 million bushels. Increased war risk premiums for goods shipped eastward via the Suez Canal, along with a lack of exports and very favorable crop weather, have largely dampened bullish sentiment. However, a strong telegram from Winnipeg today helped stabilize the market somewhat. Prices rose slightly.

### Viewing the Sky Through a Pipe (2)

After the Westerners climbed over the wall and exited, they went directly to the side of the main road and saw that it was made of wood. Soldiers were guarding and patrolling everywhere along the road. When they were seen by the soldiers, they were all very angry! Some forcefully tried to pull someone away, while others said that the Emperor's procession had already passed, so there was no need to spy. Someone stood firm and did not respond, only saying that hiding behind the wall could do no harm. Soon after, two servants also arrived, looking anxious and exasperated. They grabbed someone's hand and said, "We should leave this place quickly; that's the best course of action." Someone comforted them and said, "Why don't you two also take a look here? I assure you it's harmless." The servants said they absolutely did not want to watch; the joy in the eyes is limited, but the pain to the neck is infinite. At that moment, someone noticed a small hole in the wall and immediately focused their attention on it, ignoring what others were saying. They faintly heard the sound of rumbling carts and saw many heavily loaded vehicles passing by in a disorderly manner. They glimpsed several people on horseback, wearing long red coats and yellow hats, galloping past. Officials of the Imperial Guards followed. At this point, someone strained their eyes and saw clumsy carts arriving in succession, and soldiers in red coats also passed by on horseback in droves. Manchu archers followed, with large bows and quivers full of arrows. Their clothing was of various colors—blue, white, yellow, and black—and their steps were not very uniform. When someone saw the yellow parasol approaching in the distance, they knew that the Emperor's arrival was imminent. The Emperor was in a sedan chair, carried respectfully by eight people. The Empress Dowager and concubines were all in yellow carriages. The Empress Dowager sat upright in her carriage, looking healthy and composed. The Emperor was wearing a blue robe.

### Black Rice and White Rice

— Meng Zhao

Written for the 6/3 Commemoration Day

People mired in the black register [opium addicts] would rather go without white rice than spend a day without black rice (opium). At night, a lamp flickers as they indulge in their habit! Caressing their concubines on the left and holding their jade pipes on the right, they inhale and exhale, finding joy in their habit. No matter how expensive opium becomes, rising from three or four yuan per tael to fifty or sixty yuan per tael, the addicts do not bat an eye! They come out looking three parts human and seven parts ghost, truly terrifying!

Since the withdrawal of the National Revolutionary Army from the west, the poisonous atmosphere has filled the alleys of this isolated island. Those profiting from the national crisis build high walls and dig deep moats around themselves, turning day into night and night into a painting in their bright and clean boudoirs, dedicating their precious time and money to the sound of inhalations... And then there are the penniless wretches who cannot afford black rice, hiding under every wall and in every corner, smoking red pills and swallowing white powder... These... are all reflections of the poisonous schemes of a nation and a race facing ruin.

In the occupied cities, opium dens and opium shops are even more ubiquitous, luring well-meaning compatriots into the dark and sunken sea of misery. The interiors of these opium dens are exquisitely furnished, with painted and powdered she-devils there to provide entertainment. Once you fall into this trap, how can you find your way back? Even in the so-called "paradise" of this isolated hellhole, besides gambling and drinking, black rice and women are the sole poisons that will destroy your wealth and your life. Yet, how many who enter there can turn back? News reports are increasingly filled with stories of suicide and imprisonment, which is truly lamentable!

On the other hand, the poor, struggling to survive, face the terror of not having enough white rice, let alone black rice! Whether it is foreign rice or Du rice, sold by the measure, it still costs five or six dollars to fill their stomachs. How can the laborers who earn only meager wages through their labor and sweat afford this? Their wives cry, their children wail, making it no different from a hell on earth.

Today is the "6/3 Commemoration Day" of Commissioner Lin Zexu's opium prohibition. I hope that the leisurely class who have money to smoke black rice will make a painful effort to quit. Then, put down the butcher's knife and start anew as a complete person, diverting the money saved from quitting to disaster relief funds and to helping the poor, so that after freeing themselves from the sea of misery, they can also help those truly good people who do not have "white rice to eat." Wouldn't that be a cause for great joy?

### My Views on Improving Men's Summer Clothing

— Jun Jiu

In this era of expensive goods and the need to economize on both time and money, we feel that the Youth Association's call for design submissions and advocacy is something everyone is eagerly awaiting.

In the past, there have been several attempts to improve men's summer clothing, but their results have been, as Mr. Er Dong said, "due to poor planning, they soon faded into obscurity." I believe that this poor planning is not simply due to those responsible failing to take the lead or neglecting the actual circumstances of the masses; at least part of the reason is this.

The main purpose of summer clothing is to be lightweight and cool. No one can deny that the complexity of Western suits and the cumbersome nature of long robes make them unsuitable for summer wear. I remember that some people once advocated using the existing styles of work clothes and school uniforms to make changes, but this ultimately failed to arouse public sympathy. The reason for this is very simple: work clothes, children's clothes, and school uniforms still cling to the body and are just as troublesome to wear as Western suits. Moreover, most people are accustomed to wearing loose-fitting Chinese clothing, so any alteration makes them feel unnatural in their movements. Therefore, I believe that improving men's summer clothing should at least take the majority of the masses into consideration. The most effective and acceptable method, I suggest, is to modify Chinese-style clothing.

Modifying Chinese-style clothing not only caters to the public's psychology, but also suits the current economic conditions, when silk and cloth prices are so high that people dare not even ask about them. Now, making a new set of clothes, using even the cheapest spun silk, will cost at least ten dollars. If the modified style can be cut from existing old clothes, I think it can overcome all the difficulties mentioned above.

In addition, we feel that wearing shorts and going barefoot in the summer is also very necessary and worth advocating. When improving summer clothing, it seems that this point should also be taken into consideration.

### Residences and Flowers

— Li

Western people's residences are most concerned with decoration and arrangement, almost every room has several pots or bottles of flowers to embellish, and naturally feel vibrant and pleasing to the eye. Only our Chinese residences do not pay attention to this. Needless to say, poor families are like this, and most wealthy families are also like this; except when there is some celebration at home, or on days when guests are entertained, some flowers are casually put into vases. On ordinary days, you simply cannot see the shadow of flowers, so there is no vitality at all. I recently visited a literary friend and saw that his study was bright, clean, and spotless, and the most rare thing was that the bonsai was arranged on the desks, tea tables, and even the window sills, making me extremely envious. I asked him if he made them himself? He said that he did not have the skill to make bonsai, and that they were made by an expert, Mr. Kong Zhiqing. I feel that the three characters Kong Zhiqing are familiar, and I seem to have seen them in the newspaper, but it was the first time I had seen the bonsai he made, which was truly ingenious. Immediately I made a decision, I must organize my messy study well, and the first step is to ask Mr. Kong to make some bonsai for me. So I asked my literary friend for Mr. Kong's address, and it is said to be at No. 1 Sapo Road, where a bonsai exhibition is being held these days." This is indeed a coincidence, and I must visit it.

### Solving the Problem of Carrying Lunch

— Sun

Since the cost of living has increased, rice sells for fifty yuan per dan [a unit of dry volume], and coal briquettes sell for over eighty-eight yuan per hundred jin [a unit of weight], those on salary feel deeply distressed. In particular, it is even more difficult for the small clerks in modern commercial firms who provide lunch. Eating three bowls of white rice in a small restaurant costs thirty cents, and a bowl of tofu soup costs over ten cents, so each meal costs at least forty cents to fill your stomach. However, the dishwater in the small restaurants makes you want to vomit for three days, and the gas, oil, and sweaty smells make people even more uncomfortable. Therefore, I decided to bring my own lunch. I spent a lot of time considering the container for carrying the lunch. At first, I wanted to use a lunch box or a hand-carried rice pot like the Huzhou silk weavers, but I felt that using the above-mentioned containers would be embarrassing, especially for those of us who wear long gowns. In today's snobbish world, I am afraid that carrying a rice pot in the morning and evening would be ridiculed by others, and cold rice and cold dishes are not suitable for those who use their brains to work. Finally, I thought of using two-pound wide-mouth thermos bottles, one for hot rice and the other for hot soup and dishes. For the convenience of carrying, I made a hand-carried wooden box according to the size of the two thermos bottles, like a schoolboy's hand-carried bag. It is convenient to carry, and the thermos bottles are not easily broken. The rice can be cooked on a coal briquette stove in the morning while washing up, until it is 80% done, and then it can be put into the thermos bottle. The soup and dishes are also cooked and put into the bottle. The time spent cooking rice and dishes is less than ten minutes. At lunchtime, you can have hot soup and hot rice. In summer, if you cook it the night before and put it in, it can also keep warm until lunch the next day. The cost of each meal is only about twenty-five cents. I have been doing this for almost a year, and many colleagues have followed my method. Although the price of thermos bottles is expensive now, each one costs four yuan and a few corners, if you follow the above method, it will cost ten yuan to handle, and it can be saved in three months. Now that the weather is getting hot, it is not economical or hygienic to go to small restaurants. If there are any like-minded people who feel that life is not easy, you may wish to try it according to my description.

### The Daily Life of Italy's Mussolini

— Yan Maode

Amidst the tense European situation, the attitude of Italy is the first thing to note, and Italy's fate is controlled by Mussolini alone. After all, Mr. Mo is a hero of his time. In the European era of peace, he disregarded everything and launched the East African campaign. Now that Britain and France have suffered great military setbacks, how can they not take advantage of the situation? Therefore, Mussolini's every move is enough to attract the attention of the world. Now I will record some about his daily life.

Mussolini is the Prime Minister of Italy. Although he receives an annual salary of 96,000 lire, his life is simple and thrifty, no less than that of ordinary people. Moreover, the autobiography he wrote sold for 5,000 pounds in royalties in the United States, which were all donated to the poor in Rome.

Mussolini is already fifty-seven years old this year. Although he is an old man who has been struggling for a long time, because his daily life, diet, office work, and entertainment are orderly and regular, he still possesses the energy and spirit of a young man. He has a completely optimistic attitude.

Mussolini gets up every morning before six o'clock, rides a horse for an hour, and then goes to the washing room to groom himself before having breakfast; coffee and fruit are his favorite foods. After the meal, he begins to read private letters and newspapers. At nine o'clock, he goes to the State Council office—his office is just a large room with no furnishings. There, at the semi-new and old desk, he meets with the seven people who hold the six ministerial posts he concurrently holds and the chief of staff of the party army, listens to reports from all parties, and then instructs the decisions that can change the fate of millions of people.

At twelve o'clock, he goes home for lunch. The dishes are very simple, consisting of only some soup or gravy, bread, coffee, and some fruit. After lunch, he plays with his several nieces and his youngest daughter. When playing, whether it is tug-of-war, skipping rope, stacking sandbags, or building bridges, he even has to play the violin when he is happy. After that, he meets with general private relatives and people from all aspects of society, as the object of his administration.

At four o'clock, he goes to the State Council office to meet with diplomatic envoys and important foreign guests, or sometimes gives speeches to the public. At about nine o'clock, he goes home for dinner, which is richer than lunch. After the meal, he retreats to the study to read, meditate, or write, etc. When he is happy, he shows a few films at home that are never made public, or dances with a sword for half an hour, but he does not drink or smoke. He can only fall asleep when he is tired.

In short, Mussolini works very hard every day, doing nine hours of official business. In emergencies, he has to do more, sleeping only six hours a day on average, and his enjoyment of daily life is extremely simple and civilianized, but his physique can still be compared to a heavy bull, and he starts his arduous work again every day.

### One Week Economic Menu

— Ms. Yi Ying

The shad these days are terribly expensive, costing two dimes per ounce! Even if I love to eat it, I really can't afford it. Having no alternative, I will eat dried fish. Moreover, the dried fish these days are unexpectedly cheap, only two or three cents per ounce, so when to eat if not now? Dried fish is very delicious and can be said to be no less than shad. Whether it is braised in soy sauce or stewed, it is very delicious! Especially stewed, just put a few pieces of diced pork fat and a little sweet sauce, scallions, and ginger, and it tastes almost the same as shad, the only difference is that the scale part of the shad is not so fat and beautiful. However, two dimes an ounce and two or three cents an ounce are almost ten times different, so for the sake of economy, let’s abandon that and take this.

Spring and Autumn

### Star of Life (1)

We all know the stars and love the stars. Children look up at the stars in the sky, feeling a bit curious. Scientists gaze at the sky with telescopes, feeling even more curious, because they know more about how strange the stars are than children do. Jesus compared himself to a star, saying, "I am the bright morning star." What did he mean? What is the relationship between stars and us? First, stars are guides. In ancient times, before the invention of the compass, the only guide for sailors sailing in the ocean was the stars. Even the large ships of today cannot travel so quickly and safely without the stars indicating the direction in the sky. Life is like a sea, and all the people in the world are ships on this sea of life. Some encounter danger as soon as they set sail, some set out on a sunny day and have smooth sailing all the way, but later unfortunately hit a rock or run aground on a beach. Still others are battered by winds and waves and carried off course by strong currents, but in the end, they arrive safely at their destination. In this sense, if we want this ship of life to sail safely in the sea, we must have a guiding star to guide our journey. We want our bodies, memories, thoughts, and imaginations to be guided correctly, so that we do not go astray. Then, the only appropriate guiding star is the words and example of Jesus. Second, the movement of the stars. At night, we look up at the stars in the sky, and when we look again in the middle of the night, we can see that the position of the stars has changed greatly. Those in the west have disappeared, those above our heads have moved to the west, and those in the east have moved above our heads. It seems as if the stars are moving, but in reality, it is not the stars that are moving, but us people on earth, who are moving because of the rotation of the earth. God is the same to us. Sometimes God seems very close to us, and at that time our faith is firm, our love is warm, and we recognize that God is with us. Other times, it seems as if God has left us and is no longer close to us. In fact, it is not that God has left us, but that we have distanced ourselves from God, because God is in the past, in the present, and will be forever. (To be continued)

### Mr. Bryan's Salary Check

— Crarroll D. Alcott, Translated by Li Ren from the Continental News

The Municipal Council has announced that in order to retain the services of Mr. Robert T. Bryan, Jr., the Council's lawyer, it must pay an annual salary of US$7,500. Bryan has his special talents, namely a thorough knowledge of Chinese civil and criminal law, so he is seen as important to the Municipal Council. But whether Bryan's importance is worth paying an annual salary of US$7,500 in these difficult times is something that many people will question. When you consider that 3,000 laborers in the Municipal Council's Works Department went on strike for a daily wage increase of about 20 cents (later increased by 18 cents, amounting to an annual increase of US$3.40 per person), you have to wonder whether the Municipal Council's salary policies are still appropriate.

Of course, the Council will say that you can find many laborers for a few dollars, but senior officials are hard to find. This is true, but only to a certain extent. For myself, I never deceive myself into believing that others, if given the opportunity to handle my duties, could not handle them as well as I can. When 3,000 low-wage laborers can endanger the health of this city in order to seek a slight improvement in their livelihood, then the public will begin to lose faith in the Municipal Council's senior officials. I believe that senior figures in the Municipal Council's various departments should receive huge salaries if necessary, even if paid in foreign currency. However, the issue of how much salary should be paid must be carefully considered. Three years ago, an annual salary of US$7,500 for the Municipal Council's lawyer seemed too high, but today it is indeed too high.

### Shanghai's Pawnshop Industry

— Wang Pei

Pawnshops were originally established by local authorities, not for profit, but purely to assist the economic needs of the common people. They were intended as a borrowing place beneficial to the poor. Fearing non-repayment after borrowing, items were pledged as collateral, hence the name "pawnshop." The interest rates set were particularly low, only one or two percent per month. Later, general merchants, seeing the potential for profit, established them in large numbers for profit, gradually raising the interest rates, completely losing the original intention of assisting the economic needs of the common people.

The high interest rates charged by pawnshops in our country are rare in the world. In Shanghai, the typical interest rate for ordinary pawnshops is 1.8% per month, although some charge 1.6%, but that is less common. In addition to interest, there are various methods of exploitation, such as in terms of time limits: there is the "no more than five days per month" rule, meaning that if it is overdue by five days each month, interest is calculated for a full month. In addition, there are so-called handling fees, storage fees, packaging fees, and other charges. Although the interest rate is nominally 1.8% per month, it is actually 2% or more. Therefore, pawnshops today have become a disguised form of high-interest lending.

In general Shanghai pawnshops, the set redemption period is usually eighteen months. From the first of this month, the pawnshop industry has resolved to change the redemption period to twelve months, meaning that from the time an item is pawned, the time for redemption cannot exceed twelve months, or it will be confiscated. Although there are provisions for a grace period after the expiration date, a higher interest rate must be paid during this period. The main reason for shortening the redemption period is, of course, that pawnshops have too many pawned items, and the poor are unable to redeem them, preventing the pawnshop capital from circulating. However, drastically shortening the redemption period will further exploit the poor, as they will be unable to raise the cash within this short period and will have to watch their items expire and be confiscated. Therefore, shortening the redemption period may indeed increase the pawnshop's income significantly, but it reduces the common people's opportunity to redeem their pawned items, indirectly shortening the lifeline of the poor.

### Do Not Enter Hell

— A Certain Person

Today, June 3rd, once again brings to mind the "floating corpse case" in Tianjin. Although "floating corpses" with numerous sores all over their bodies have not yet been found in the Huangpu River in Shanghai, the suburbs of the concessions are being engulfed in poisonous flames, and countless self-destructive compatriots are unknowingly falling into hell. Although "floating corpses" have not been seen in the Huangpu River, the wilderness in the suburbs may already be filled with white bones.

Restricting planting and ordering the prohibition of opium had already achieved considerable success before the war. Opium prohibition bureaus were generally established in various counties and towns, requiring addicts to register and prioritizing abstinence based on age. In my hometown, the age groups are divided into ten-year periods, starting from under twenty to forty years old, and we have already reached the third period. The number of people who have quit this bad habit can be said to be over seventy or eighty percent. The poor can receive financial assistance in designated hospitals. However, after the outbreak of the war, some people secretly operated in the concessions, and even more relied on special forces in the occupied areas, openly displaying opium dens. And self-destructive compatriots have once again fallen into hell.

Fortunately, the prohibition regulations of the concessions are the same as the orders of the Chinese government. If there can be a practical or large-scale "drug prohibition movement," it will not be difficult to eliminate the poison. It is hoped that starting from today, like the efforts to promote the "daylight saving time" movement and the "safety" movement, we can make those demons have nowhere to escape in one fell swoop, and the crime rate in the concessions may also be reduced as a result.

And every citizen of the Republic of China should be strong. Those who have escaped the sea of suffering should not be tempted again, and we should also resolve to strengthen ourselves and quit immediately. The new China that is being built does not need degenerate people.

Hawthorne's Investigation

### The Fate of the Dance Queen

— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing

Chapter 1 "A Quite Beautiful Lady!"

The female guest was about five feet one or two inches tall, which can be considered tall and graceful among the generally short women in the southeastern part of our country. She wore a short cape of light cyan fine serge on her upper body, revealing a red and white striped silk cheongsam underneath, which covered the backs of her silver leather perforated shoes. She had a melon-seed-shaped face, with cheekbones that were strikingly red. A pair of lively, dark eyes were covered by two slender artificial eyebrows—her original natural eyebrows were often destroyed by barbers, leaving no trace! The position of her nose was very appropriate, and the bridge of her nose was thin, straight, and not low, which was also an important element in her beauty. Her small mouth was originally one of the main reasons for her beauty, but because she wore too much lipstick, it made me feel a little "apprehensive." The skin on her face was certainly white and delicate to the highest degree, but I dare not believe that it was mostly due to the power of "lead powder." Therefore, it was not easy to judge whether she was eighteen or nineteen, or twenty-three or twenty-four.

"You—you are not Hawthorne—" she looked at me suspiciously, while raising her slender fingers with powder-pink nail polish, and brushed her permed, almost reddish-brown hair. She also wore a rather large diamond ring on her finger.

I replied: "Mr. Hawthorne will be back soon. Would you like to sit down for a while?" I said this somewhat reluctantly, because her kind of unnatural dignified manner—arrogance, and that impolite address, had revealed her identity or level of education.

She took off the cape, revealing two jade arms that had also been artificially decorated. Her clothes were very thin. Because of the tailor's exquisite skills, the cheongsam and her muscles were particularly smooth, making it seem even less able to withstand the chill of this late spring morning. But she didn't seem to feel it, which made me admire the strong cold resistance of urban women.

She sat on the sofa near the desk, crossed one leg over the other, and my eyes added another color. Her feet were also bare like mine, and scarlet toes were revealed in the perforations of the silver leather. Her sitting posture seemed very skilled, tilting one foot, putting a red and white interlaced leather handbag on her thigh, and glancing at me as if waiting for me to flatter her. (3)
