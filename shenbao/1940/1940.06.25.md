This morning, the representatives from both sides did not convene, and the time for the final decision meeting has not yet been announced. Last night's meeting took place in the village of Inzisa, 19 kilometers from Rome. The Italian delegation arrived two minutes before the French delegation. Foreign Minister Ciano was accompanied by the Director of Protocol, Celesia, and others. The Italian representatives were all in military uniform and saluted in the Roman style to signal their respect when they saw the French representatives arriving. The French representatives sat opposite the Italian representatives. After taking their seats, Ciano stood up and stated that General Badoglio intended to convey the armistice terms to the French representatives. Badoglio rose and asked General Roatta to read the armistice terms.

French Commander in Syria Declares Continued Resistance

London – Responsible sources here recently stated that although Franco-German armistice negotiations have been concluded, authorities in French territories are still extremely agitated. Among them, General Mittelhauser, commander of French forces in the French mandate of Syria, has declared his determination to continue the resistance. Governor-General Catroux of Vietnam has also declared his unwillingness to surrender. In addition, authorities in Tunis, Cameroon, Morocco, Senegal, Djibouti, and other locations have all stated their determination to uphold the principles of the Allied powers with loyalty. The British government is therefore preparing to take all necessary financial measures to ensure that the French colonial empire can fulfill its responsibilities. Indeed, Britain's goal is to fully restore France proper and its overseas territories, as declared by Prime Minister Churchill. (Havas Telegraph, 23rd)

London – The French High Commissioner in Syria recently broadcast on Radio Beirut that General Mittelhauser, commander-in-chief of French forces in Syria, has decided to carry out France's mission in Syria and to defend France's honor and its flag there with invincible perseverance. The High Commissioner also stated that his views were completely in line with those of General Mittelhauser. (Reuters Telegraph, 24th)

Hanover – British aircraft bombed Bückeburg yesterday. This is the location where Germany holds its annual Harvest Festival. Although many bombs were dropped, the damage was minimal. Some incendiary bombs fell into the water. Bückeburg has no military significance, and there are no military targets within several miles of it. (Haitong Telegraph, 24th)

German and Italian War Reports

Berlin – German military experts, in a conversation with a reporter from Haitong News Agency, added details to the German war report, stating that after the end of the battles in Alsace and Lorraine, the Franco-German war had effectively ended. The French government requested an armistice when the French army had completely collapsed. The French government requested an armistice after the French army was defeated by the German army on the front lines. Defeat was the cause, and the armistice was the result. This must be remembered so that future history books do not reverse cause and effect. The German army captured 500,000 French soldiers in the two provinces of Alsace-Lorraine, including three army commanders and many generals. The amount of military supplies and provisions captured is almost impossible to estimate. There are still small-scale battles along the Maginot Line in the areas of Sarre-Union, Haguenau, and the Vosges, but these are unrelated to the overall situation and can be cleared up in a short period of time. German forces along the Atlantic coast continue to advance south of the Loire River. Mobile units have approached the naval port of La Rochelle. German forces have also occupied the naval port of Nantes and captured 40 tanks already loaded onto ships. The French air force north of Bordeaux has been completely annihilated. German aircraft have been very successful in bombing merchant ships and transport ships along the Atlantic coast between Nantes and the Gironde. German forces are advancing south from Lyon, crossing the Rhône River in the foothills of the Savoy Alps south of Geneva. Mountain warfare is very difficult. The air force cannot easily assist the army, and tanks and motorized units also have difficulty maneuvering. However, the German army has gained experience in mountain warfare during the Norwegian campaign. However, the French forces in this area are all well-trained units prepared for mountain warfare. (Haitong Telegraph, 24th)

Hitler's Headquarters – This afternoon, the German military report stated that the following areas on the French Atlantic coast have been occupied by German forces: south to the mouth of the Gironde River, La Rochelle, and Rochefort. German forces captured a large amount of military supplies and occupied a large-scale artillery factory. Within Alsace-Lorraine, several isolated units surrendered. Several more fortifications of the Maginot Line have been occupied by German forces. Southeast of Lyon, German forces broke through enemy resistance and are now advancing towards Grenoble and Chambéry. Last night, several German fast boats sank two armed British ships with torpedoes, one with a displacement of 3,500 tons and one with a displacement of 5,000 tons. A submarine claims to have sunk no less than 22,500 tons of enemy cargo. Last night, the German Air Force only flew reconnaissance missions over the North Sea. German fighter planes shot down two British fighter planes near Calais. Nine British fighter planes attempted to fly over Dutch territory yesterday afternoon, and six were shot down by German fighter planes and anti-aircraft guns. Two or three British fighter planes, using thick clouds as cover, invaded the German town of Damme in Holstein, dropping several bombs and strafing residents with machine guns, seriously injuring two people and slightly injuring four people. Several bombs also hit the prisoner-of-war camp on the coast near Borkum, injuring and killing several French people. (Haitong Telegraph, 24th)

Rome – The Italian military headquarters issued a war report today stating that on June 21, our forces along the Alpine front began attacking enemy positions, occupying the Cheneil fort and many important strongholds near Briançon. Our forces also broke through the Isère, Arc, Var, and Vésubie positions in the Alpine valleys, and the enemy is now under attack from both front and rear. (Haitong Telegraph, 24th)

Editorial

### Various Aspects After the French Armistice

The contents of the Franco-German armistice agreement were only disclosed yesterday and reached Shanghai. This is the most timely topic for today's newspaper. It should start from the agreement and discuss everything. Not only should reporters do this, but readers also expect it.

Exceptionally, the reporter begs the readers for forgiveness. Although the current topic cannot be abandoned, this commentary has no conclusion. Not only is there no conclusion. According to the general mission of commentary, or what is called representing public opinion, newspapers should express the views in the hearts of readers on current issues on their behalf. Or what is called guiding public opinion, newspapers should provide a kind of view for readers who are doubtful and confused about the problem, for readers to agree with and adopt. The reporter originally did not dare to claim to be able to represent or guide. And today's discussion of the Franco-German armistice agreement, not only does not want to represent or guide, but is afraid that the result of the discussion will only increase the readers' frustration.

Frustration is unavoidable, because fundamentally this is a frustrating problem, a problem of the whole world.

The content of the Franco-German armistice agreement, according to Reuters London telegraphic report from the British side, which is also not the official report of the United States, totals 21 articles. The articles are as published in today's news column, and there is no time to annotate and explain them one by one. Readers who carefully read the articles of the agreement will be able to understand what the future survival state of the French nation and the French people under such clauses will be like.

But please pay attention to the reader: First, these are the conditions of Germany to France, and do not include the conditions of Italy to France; therefore, in the part remaining of the French nation in this Franco-German agreement, the conditions of Italy must also be removed, and this is the "net residue" after the armistice. Second, this is only an armistice agreement, which is a transitional condition from the armistice to the complete end of the future war situation, that is, a temporary measure, and not a peace treaty between Germany and France that has a permanent nature in law. Third, the future peace treaty is another article, and the peace treaty may be stricter to varying degrees than the armistice agreement due to various factors; it may also be more lenient to varying degrees than the armistice agreement due to various factors; and it may even make the armistice agreement like a blank sheet of paper due to various factors. All sorts of things are possible and completely unknown. Up to now, we should only clearly recognize the essence of this armistice agreement. As for what the future holds and what the consequences will be, please reserve it in frustration.

The Franco-German armistice is such an agreement, regardless of the future or the consequences, but only discuss the reactions that we already know at present: First, Britain, an allied country that has the same friendship with France and fights side by side, declares that it does not recognize the organization that accepts this armistice agreement as the French government; second, apart from the French government presided over by President Lebrun and General Pétain, that is, the government denied by its allied country, there will be a so-called "French Provisional National Committee", which Britain will recognize as the representative organization of the Allied powers: Third, some French colonies and dependencies and some overseas French nationals have successively declared that they will join hands with Britain and continue to fight; fourth, some French warships have already joined the British navy and continue to fight. These four items are the obvious reactions after the French side accepted the armistice agreement, and can generally be regarded as news based on facts.

In addition to the obvious reactions and factual news, we don't need to add some imagination to think about how other aspects will develop. But in terms of factual reaction, there are also corresponding current doubts: First, of the various provisions stipulated by the French government accepting the armistice agreement, quite a few items cannot be effectively implemented with an order, so will the part that cannot be implemented cause difficulties beyond the agreement on the German side. Second, the French government accepting the armistice agreement, on the one hand, is already under the mighty power of the victorious country, and on the other hand, it is spurned by its allied country Britain, so in terms of psychology and action, emotion and fact, everything about Germany and Britain immediately encounters the fork in the road of friend or foe, how will it choose to obey or violate. Third, Germany and Britain are absolute opposites. From these two sides, in any corner of the international community, they have implicitly or explicitly become two opposing routes. For these two routes, we can no longer carve a mark on the boat to seek the sword, thinking that there is a unified whole French national policy and attitude that can be regarded as their criteria and sought after; then, what will we, or any non-French person, take as a criterion for everything about the French nation in the international community. In short, generally speaking, with its internal divisions and external complexities, divided by and multiplied by each other, gains and losses, all kinds of completely different possibilities are presented at the same time. All contradictions cannot be weighed. The word "subtle" is not enough to describe its subtlety. The reporter never dares to act as an interpreter and conclude it. To try to conclude, just observe the further evolution of various aspects.

The Japanese planes dropped no fewer than hundreds of incendiary and explosive bombs. Chinese casualties were at least two hundred people, and at least a thousand civilian houses were destroyed.

Chongqing issued an air raid alert at noon, which lasted for four and a half hours. The British and French consulates were bombed at 2:40 PM. Six coolies were killed by bombs in the open space at the entrance of the French Consulate.

Just as they reached the basement, the consulate was destroyed. Since the German Consulate was bombed on May 4th of last year, only the British and French consulates remained in Chongqing. A total of twenty-seven Japanese planes bombed the consulates, while other planes bombed elsewhere.

### General de Gaulle Announces the Organization of the French National Committee in England; Calls on Comrades to Continue Resistance and Maintain Independence; Hopes for Belgian Cooperation in Defending Freedom

London – Former French Undersecretary of Defense General de Gaulle recently delivered a broadcast speech in French here, announcing the establishment of the "French National Committee," calling on comrades to continue fighting to maintain the independence of the motherland. He said, "The enemy's proposed armistice conditions have actually been accepted by our government. In this way, all our military equipment, airplanes, warships, and gold will be used to benefit the enemy. This kind of surrender directly makes France a complete slave of the enemy, and the Bordeaux government directly depends on the whims of Germany and Italy. What is the true will of the French people? There is currently no opportunity to express it. We have obtained the consent of the British government to establish the French National Committee to represent the interests of the motherland. All our countrymen who decide to continue fighting to maintain the independence of the motherland and fulfill their obligations, cooperating in the war until the Allied countries achieve a common victory, will also have their interests represented by the committee." The list of committee members will be announced soon. French military and political personnel who are already in British territory or are about to come will be commanded by the committee. Once a "independent and legitimate government of France is re-established," the committee will report its actions to it. In addition, Belgians are also expected to come forward and cooperate to defend their country's freedom. "In short, the war has not yet been defeated, the motherland has not yet been destroyed, and hope has not yet been extinguished. All my comrades, please rise up quickly. Long live France!" (24th Havas Dispatch)

Britain Recalls Envoy to France, Does Not Recognize Bordeaux Government

London – Last night, London broadcast in French, saying that the British government found that the newly signed armistice conditions contradicted the treaties solemnly concluded with the Allied governments, placing the Bordeaux government in a state of complete submission to the enemy and depriving all free French citizens of their freedom and power to represent them. Therefore, the British government now announces that it can no longer recognize the Bordeaux government as the government of an independent country. The British government has noted the proposal to organize a temporary French National Committee to fully represent the independent French people who are determined to fight and uphold France's international obligations. The British government now announces that it will recognize this temporary National Committee and will discuss with the committee all matters related to the conduct of the war as long as the committee continues to represent the French people who are determined to fight the common enemy. Before the British government broadcast this announcement, General de Gaulle, the military tactical director of the former French Reynaud cabinet, broadcast from London, saying that he would negotiate with the British government to organize a temporary French National Committee to represent the interests of France, determined to maintain France's independence and the honor of its allies, and to contribute to the Allied war effort. (24th Reuters)

London – It is reported that the British Ambassador to France, Sir Ronald Campbell, has led his staff to leave Bordeaux and return home. His departure from France is because France is now almost entirely ravaged by the German army, and his capture would inevitably cause many troubles, and not because of any severe changes in the relationship between the British and French governments. According to officials, the British government still recognizes Marshal Pétain's Bordeaux government. General de Gaulle, the military advisor to former French Prime Minister Reynaud, is now in London calling on many French territories and French citizens to continue the war. His actions have been fully supported by the British government. The number of French people around the world who responded is very large. Since he delivered his broadcast speech last night, telegrams from groups and individuals have poured in like snowflakes, all expressing their willingness to pledge allegiance to the motherland and continue the war. The French ambassador and his staff will remain in London to represent the French Republic. (24th Reuters)

Bordeaux – After the Franco-German armistice was signed, Britain recalled its diplomatic representatives to the French government. It is reported that British Ambassador Campbell left Bordeaux with key members of the embassy and boarded a British destroyer. According to the remaining staff of the British Embassy, journalists, and other British expatriates, they had boarded chartered ships and set off to return to Britain a week ago when they first heard of France's request for an armistice. However, the British ambassador remained in Bordeaux to report developments to the British government. (24th Reuters)

Geneva – According to Bordeaux sources, after the German-French armistice agreement was signed, British Ambassador to France Campbell quietly left Bordeaux, thus severing British-French diplomatic relations. It is learned that when the British ambassador left yesterday, he led the embassy staff to board a destroyer and return home. (24th Haitong News Agency)

### French Government Issues Statement Refuting Churchill's Speech; Pétain Also Delivers Speech Responding to British Prime Minister

Bordeaux – After British Prime Minister Churchill delivered a speech yesterday on the armistice agreement between France and Germany, the French government issued a statement protesting, stating, "It is the government's duty to bring Prime Minister Churchill's speech to the attention of the people, but at the same time, it must raise the most sincere protest against the content of the speech, because the British government has been closely watching the progress of the past war, so the British government is fully aware of all the factors that led the French government to cease fighting. Under these circumstances, it is difficult to condone Prime Minister Churchill's critical tone of France's armistice. Until now, Prime Minister Churchill has always expressed a friendly understanding of the current suffering needs, but yesterday's speech is very different. Our government has always strived to avoid adding the pain of the loss of the relationship between Britain and France to the current tragic torment. However, Prime Minister Churchill's speech yesterday contradicted this long-cherished wish. The British government obviously wants to distinguish between the French government and the will of the people. The French government hereby denies this, because the government believes that what it has done is for the sake of national interests and will surely be supported by the people of the whole country. For this reason, the French government should refute certain points of Prime Minister Churchill's speech, and it should immediately reject several points that have other intentions. In short, the French government has no other way to go except for the course it has now chosen, and the French public should be able to understand this." (24th Havas Dispatch)

Bordeaux – Premier Marshal Pétain delivered a radio address last night in response to British Prime Minister Churchill, saying, "Our government and people were depressed and shocked by Prime Minister Churchill's speech yesterday. We understand the suffering on the British side. In essence, it is that Prime Minister Churchill is deeply afraid that the misfortune that France has suffered in recent months will befall Britain. Although the situation is not yet at that point, we are not willing to remain silent about the lessons provided by foreign cabinet members. Prime Minister Churchill can only judge the interests of Britain, but he cannot judge the interests of our country, let alone the honor of our country. In fact, our national flag has never been stained, and our army has fought bravely everywhere to defend the motherland. It was only because of inferior military equipment and fewer personnel that we were forced to request an armistice. We have now done so with an independent and dignified attitude. In short, at this time of national crisis, the French people are united and will not be divided by anything." (24th Havas Dispatch)

Tokyo – A spokesman for the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced today that Japan's diplomatic strategy will change, but the basic principles have not changed. The Hochi Shimbun said that Japan must strengthen its relations with Germany and Italy, and Foreign Minister Arita's policy clearly has this tendency. However, it seems inevitable to encounter difficulties if Japan wants to clarify the relationship between Japan and the United States. However, even if Japan wants to improve its attitude towards the United States and the Soviet Union, it must still maintain good relations with Germany and Italy. The newspaper also predicted that there will be changes in the foreign service after the Japanese government adopts a diplomatic policy, which is also worth noting. (24th Haitong

### The Largest French Arsenal Falls into German Hands

Kruse: Kloss, a war correspondent with the German army, recently described the situation at Kruse, the largest French arsenal. He stated, "As we entered the largest French arsenal through the main gate, the people there greeted us with nervous expressions. The factory has a history of over a hundred years, and its scale and production capacity are comparable to those of Krupp. It has branches throughout France, specializing in the manufacture of French military arms. Now, the city of Kruse has not been damaged by artillery fire, and its arsenal has completely fallen into German hands. The French army retreated early in the morning, and the city was immediately occupied by the German army. The French retreat was so hasty that very few machines in the factory were damaged. The German advance was indeed rapid, catching the enemy off guard at every turn. The factory has a large stock of steel plates. The armor plates for the Maginot Line and the steel plates for French battleships were all manufactured by this factory. In addition, it is capable of other productions. The workers stood and watched us, with a slight look of surprise. The factory has never stopped working. When the French army retreated, the factory did not stop production. There are approximately several thousand workers. There are unfinished gun barrels and machine guns for airplanes in the factory. The factory workers are proud that they were able to produce 400 cannons per month during the World War." (Haitong Telegraph, 24th)

### The Final Act of the Compiègne Negotiations: French Representatives Sought Instructions from Bordeaux Before Signing

Compiègne: The French delegation communicated with Bordeaux as the final act before signing the armistice agreement. According to eyewitnesses, the originally scheduled call was for two hours, but the time was eventually doubled. The technical staff of the French delegation repeatedly tried to connect with Bordeaux, but the telephone line between Tours and Bordeaux had a fault. The French representatives were extremely anxious. Meanwhile, General Jodl, Commander-in-Chief of the German Wehrmacht, waited for news by the forest. By 5 p.m., the telephone line was still not connected, and it was proposed that the French representatives use a wireless telephone instead, when suddenly the telephone line connected. The French representatives gathered around the telephone. General Huntziger, the chief French representative, began the conversation, followed by Ambassador Noel. The telephone then suddenly cut off. Schmidt, a ministerial-level translator from the German Foreign Office, was invited to the French representatives' car at 6 p.m. General Huntziger, the chief French representative, requested an extension of time. By this point, five hours had passed since the end of the negotiations. General Jodl, Commander-in-Chief of the German Wehrmacht, then accepted this request in a German letter, stipulating that 7:30 p.m. was the latest deadline. Schmidt handed the letter to the French delegation and went to the place by the forest where General Jodl was waiting for news. After a brief discussion, the French representatives invited the German representatives to board the car. General Jodl led the German representatives to board the car. After a ten-minute meeting between the representatives of the two countries, the French delegation announced its readiness to sign. The Franco-German armistice was signed at 6:50 p.m. (Haitong Telegraph, 24th)

### The New York Times Reviews the Consequences of France's Capitulation, Saying France Will Become a Tool of the German War Machine Against Its Will

New York: The New York Times reported that the French people would be able to judge the harsh terms imposed on them by Compiègne and Rome in the future. They would have many opportunities to wonder whether this terrible punishment was lighter than if the French government had continued to resist from the colonies or foreign territories. France may retain traces of independence, but they will be nominal. At present, France will become a tool of the German war machine against its will. The enemy may gain from it various secrets shared by France and its allies, and even the plans surrounding the unconquerable bird's nest fortress will be handed over to the enemy under duress. The newspaper continued that British Prime Minister Churchill had indicated that France's acceptance of the armistice treaty was tantamount to becoming an active enemy. The terrible result is that Britain will be forced to fight against the French territories now occupied by the enemy, or to bomb French cities and accidentally injure French civilians, or to suffer along with France when Germany is tightly blockaded.

### London Comments on Armistice Agreement, Calling it France's Utter Shame

London: After the signing of the armistice agreement between Germany and France, responsible officials here issued a statement commenting on it, saying, "This agreement forces France to hand over all its troops, armaments, and various goods to Germany, and to allow Germany to occupy most of its territory as a base for operations against Britain. The French government may live in peace in the south, but it must be completely at the mercy of Germany. As for the peace treaty to be negotiated between Germany and France, there is no indication of its content at this time. However, one point is very clear: Germany has no intention of discussing peace at this time. In a word, this armistice agreement has forced France to completely surrender. French Foreign Minister Baudouin recently gave a radio address, saying that France would never accept humiliating conditions, but what conditions could be more humiliating than this? France has a solemn treaty with Britain, stating that it will never make a separate peace. At this moment, it is using its territory and material resources to allow the enemy to attack its allies, which is utterly shameful. In short, Foreign Minister Baudouin's declaration and the alliance treaty between Britain and France have been completely destroyed by the Pétain government. This act of losing faith is not only deeply hated by French expatriates overseas, but will also be unanimously condemned by the people of the country. The people of the country have been prevented by this move of the government from emulating other countries that have been invaded by Germany, and from continuing to fight against the common enemy in an environment where they have good hope of ultimate victory. Deprivation is not tragic. Our Prime Minister Churchill announced yesterday that Britain would uphold the claims of the French nation, and that Britain's victory is the only hope for France to restore its greatness and its people to restore their freedom." (Havas, 23rd)

### French Newspapers Comment on the Armistice Issue

Bordeaux: Yesterday, French newspapers all published editorials, forcefully stating that the French army's armistice was out of necessity. Before requesting an armistice, the French army had exhausted its efforts in combat, and it was forced to do so only when it could no longer fight. The conservative newspaper "Le Figaro" commented on the armistice, saying, "We should not show weakness, nor should we hate. France's war is not for material interests. France's defeat will not lead to the loss of its national prestige. France fought to save culture, and has done its utmost." Le Petit Parisien quoted General Jodl, the German representative in the armistice negotiations, praising the French army, and said, "We already know that the French army is brave and invincible in combat, and has done its utmost to resist the invaders." Also, the semi-official French newspaper "Le Temps" wrote that if Britain at that time could send a well-equipped army to France, France would never have been forced to beg Hitler for peace.

### The Situation in the Balkans is Becoming Increasingly Delicate, with Rumors that Italy is Laying Mines in Greek Territorial Waters, and the Soviet Union Denying Negotiations with Turkey

Budapest: The competition between the Soviet Union and the German-Italian Axis for political and economic control of the Balkans is becoming increasingly apparent today. It is claimed that the Italian Navy has laid mines in Greek territorial waters to block shipping to Turkey, Syria, and Egypt. The development of the situation in Romania last week is enough to show that the friction between the Axis powers and Moscow is becoming increasingly tense. Because of the Soviet Union's serious oppression of Bucharest, King Carol of Romania has been unable to comply with the requests of Germany and Italy to establish a completely right-wing government. Observers here say that Italy's laying of mines in Greek territorial waters is a warning to the Soviet Union not to try to interfere in Romania, Bulgaria, and Turkey, because Italy demands to obtain a passage in order to attack Thessaloniki and Istanbul if necessary. As for the Soviet Union's military occupation of the Baltic states and its deployment of a hundred divisions of the Red Army to the German-Soviet border between the Baltic and Black Seas, it is believed here that this is due to the Soviet Union's confusion in view of the war activities of the Fascists and Nazis. It is generally believed here that if the Soviet Union launches an attack, it will simultaneously rush into Bessarabia and Bulgaria. Because of this, Romania may become a battleground in the Balkans. This week, the Soviet Minister to Budapest invited senior officials here, as well as the envoys of Germany, Italy, and Japan, to the Soviet Embassy to watch a movie. The name of the first film was "Peter the Great," which shows its profound significance (United Press, 24th)

### The Times of London Discusses the Future of the War: The Soul of Europe Will Not Die and Will Eventually Be Liberated

London: The Times of London today published an editorial criticizing the terms of the armistice accepted by the Bordeaux government, saying that Great Britain and other places where the British flag flies undoubtedly or without hesitation know that our war is not only for self-defense. There is something more to it. What Nazi Germany, with its entire self-esteem of eugenics, offers to mankind is nothing but servitude. Only its occasional position today, if force can do it, will impose its negotiation system on Europe by force. Know that force can never accomplish this. The soul of Europe will never die and one day will liberate its body. This is the faith held by the British, French, and their friends on the American continent. Since the Bordeaux French government personnel ceased fighting, the European war has failed, and the ocean war has not yet broken out. When the British Empire is fully aided by the survivors of all countries that cherish freedom, if it is not defeated for a day, then Hitler has not won for a day. We may need to use our strength to the extreme, or we may need to use the full force of the navy and air force to fight. However, if we insist, Hitler will be defeated. The British Empire must stand as the world's only hope, and it is also the only hope for France to be free (Reuters, 24th)

### Hong Kong's Wartime Preparations Amidst the Turmoil: Increasing Combat Personnel and Expanding the Scope of Conscription

Hong Kong Correspondence: Since the expansion of the European war situation, the Hong Kong authorities have become increasingly rigorous in their wartime preparations. Although the Governor of Hong Kong, Sir Geoffry Northcote, has left Hong Kong on vacation last month, it is said that he consulted with the Singapore authorities when he passed through Singapore to discuss the connection between Singapore and Hong Kong to facilitate military operations. He also decided to implement the opening of war taxes in Hong Kong before leaving Hong Kong. Therefore, the War Tax Bureau has recently notified major commercial firms to report their business accounts for last year within a month. Those who conceal or falsely report figures to underreport after the deadline will be charged with violating the War Tax Act. This shows one aspect of the preparations.

Strengthening Strength: Establishing a Compulsory Military Service Bureau
Regarding strength, the Hong Kong authorities are actively seeking to increase combat personnel. Therefore, the scope of conscription has been expanded, and combat supplementary regiments have been added. In addition to the regular army, Hong Kong usually has naval and land volunteer forces, which are voluntary in nature, and their organization and equipment are comparable to the regular army. In the past three years, due to the many events in Europe, they have been actively expanding and intensifying training. People of various nationalities, including Chinese, English, Portuguese, and Indian, have participated, with the English being the most numerous. The Army Volunteer Force has a total of six battalions of high-射炮 anti-aircraft gun, machine gun, and rifle units. The Navy Volunteer Force has multiple patrol boats. Recently, ships coming and going to the Hong Kong port have been rented for further training. A unit has been dispatched to patrol the port and perform guard duties. As for the British in Hong Kong, they had previously received instructions from London to enlist in Hong Kong. Therefore, the Hong Kong authorities have established a compulsory military service bureau to review the British men of conscription age residing in Hong Kong and Shanghai. In addition to those who have already joined the volunteer army, the rest will be assigned to the combat ranks of the navy and army. Therefore, many British expatriates in Shanghai have also come to Hong Kong to enlist. Those who do not want to join the combat team due to their jobs or circumstances must provide sufficient reasons and be approved by the compulsory military service tribunal, then they can be assigned to the guarding posts and sentry of the Army Volunteer Force to be mobilized temporarily. Previously, the military service tribunal ordered 350 people to take on this task. However, the Hong Kong authorities believe that the Hong Kong environment urgently needs to increase the wartime manpower source. Therefore, it was decided to select the patrol posts and incorporate them into the combat supplementary regiment to make them enlist in training and combat. It is also heard that 120 people have been selected.

Inspecting Ships: Defenses are Extremely Tight
As for the Hong Kong sea port, under the management of the naval authorities, it is sealed off at any time, inspecting ships entering and exiting the port, and dispatching speedboats to sail outside the port to patrol back and forth, so as to make the port and sea defense perfect. In addition, the air defense drill has recently been held twice. According to the statement issued by Mr. Speicher, the Director of Air Defense, the exercise results are still good. The air defense rescue team is also working hard to learn fire fighting techniques, and their results are also very good. After Italy announced its participation in the European War, the Hong Kong government immediately dispatched a special detective team to the residences and shops of Italian expatriates to monitor the Italian expatriates. The disposal method is the same as the disposal of German and Austrian expatriates in September last year. However, under special circumstances, it is exempted from being sent to concentration camps with the special permission of the Hong Kong government, and only police officers monitor their actions. The Italian consulate has stopped working immediately. As for Italian shipping companies, the Italian staff is monitored by a special detective team. The Chinese staff is dismissed after being interrogated, leaving only servants and Chinese and British detectives to guard. The remaining Italian church missionaries and nuns are specially allowed to maintain the status quo temporarily. However, the property kept by the priests and nuns in Hong Kong must not be moved. It can be said that the disposal is going smoothly.

### The Zhe-Gan Railway Extends to Ganzhou and Construction Begins at the Beginning of the Month

Nancheng Correspondence: The Zhe-Gan Railway from Guixi to Ganzhou, which connects the major arteries of the southeast and southwest, planned to build a branch road in Ganzhou with the light rail unloaded when the Zhe-Gan Railway converted the light rail from Xiaoshan to Yushan to heavy rail in 1936. At that time, two lines were selected: one from Zhangshu along the Gan River to Ganzhou, and the other from the intersection of the Beijing-Gan and Zhe-Gan lines in Guixi through eastern Gan to Ganzhou. Although both lines have been surveyed, they failed due to various reasons. Now the authorities have decided to complete this road in the shortest possible time. It is found that this line crosses Yuqi from Guixi and crosses the Xujiang River in Nancheng, southward to Nanfeng, Guangchang, Ningdu, and reaches Ganzhou. It is about 300 kilometers long. The survey has already been completed and civil workers will be recruited to build in sections. Construction is scheduled to begin on July 1 and be completed by the end of the year. After this road is successful, it can be connected to the Yue-Gui and Yue-Han lines from Ganzhou to Shaoguan, serving as a major artery connecting the southeast and southwest.

### Zhejiang Province Convenes a Meeting to Discuss Relief for the Rice Shortage: 200 People Starve to Death in Shaoxing Every Day

Yongkang Correspondence: The Zhejiang Provincial Grain Management Office learned that the rice shortage in the counties under Shaoxing is severe, the price of rice in Shaoxing is exceptionally high, and the black market price has risen to over 100 yuan per stone.

The average number of people starving to death reaches 200 per day, and the autumn harvest is still far away. The source of Gan rice is also gradually decreasing. In order to understand the grain demand figures of the grain-deficient counties so as to find ways to provide relief, a provincial grain conference was specially convened in Yongkang at 3 pm on the 12th. More than one hundred people attended, including commissioners of various districts, county heads of various counties, and local gentry. Provincial party and government committees also participated, and Huang Shaohong personally presided over the meeting. The content of the discussion included (1) sources of rice, (2) improving grain management methods, (3) increasing the purchase price of grain-surplus counties, (4) strictly practicing thrift and adjusting distribution, (5) granary preparations, and (6) general survey of grain prices. All representatives believed that they were essential and must be implemented. The government formulated measures for various counties to follow. If representatives have any opinions, they can submit them in writing within ten days. Representatives from the counties under Ningbo proposed that the procedures for collecting export certificates should be used to subsidize grain, which should be handled by each county according to local conditions. Deng Ren, the magistrate of Shaoxing County, made a temporary motion, requesting the provincial government to transport grain to Shaoxing as soon as possible to meet the needs of the military and the people and maintain local stability. Zhu Huiqing, deputy director of the Grain Management Office, replied that 70,000 dan of rice had been purchased to relieve the rice shortage in Shaoxing and was being shipped successively to be properly distributed for various counties to purchase and transport, and the transportation problem would be borne jointly by the various counties. Chairman Huang also instructed the county heads to pay attention to the grain shortage in the coming year, find ways to plant arable land, plant as much miscellaneous grain as possible, and promote thrift, and implement them effectively after returning to office. The provincial government also resolved to allocate 50,000 yuan and allocate another 30,000 yuan from the grain accumulation funds in Shaoxing to subsidize the economic porridge factory expenses in Shaoxing County.

### The Initial Situation of the European War (VII)

— Shu Di

On the eve of the declaration of war on Germany by Britain and France when the German-Polish war broke out, Franco broadcasted the following: "I appeal to the sense of responsibility and goodwill of all countries and governments, hoping to use their efforts as much as possible to localize this war (referring to the German-Polish war - author's note). The expansion of a war will inevitably cause a profound and irreparable disruption of the world economy, countless losses of world resources, paralyze world trade, and give the general public a severe blow to the standard of living. If this war is further expanded, then the seeds of a bigger war in the future will be sown."

This passage truly expresses Spain's intentions. First, she admits that the German-Polish war is justified; second, she opposes the "expansion" of the war by Britain and France; if Britain and France declare war on Germany, then they are the instigators of disrupting the world's economic life; and, incidentally, she gives Britain and France a threat that Spain may participate.

(6) Other Countries Declaring "Neutrality" (September 20)

The Second European War has been going on for exactly twenty days since the curtain was raised on the German-Polish War on September 1. In addition to the positions of the various countries that have already been described above in this war, the attitudes of the remaining countries are also an indispensable part of understanding this decisive picture of the European war situation. Here, I will first give them a temporary general classification.

The European political units left over from the last European war are thirty-five: England, Italy, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, Hungary, Romania, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Albania, Iceland, France, Germany, Poland, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Czechoslovakia, Austria, Switzerland, Greece, Spain, Portugal, Turkey, San Marino, Andorra, the Soviet Union, Luxembourg, Monaco, Liechtenstein, the Irish Free State, and the Free City of Danzig.

However, before this war broke out, Czechoslovakia, Austria, and Albania, three countries had already been eliminated.

The Free City of Danzig was the fuse for Germany's invasion of Poland. The participants in the war were Germany on one side and Britain, France, and Poland on the other. A total of four countries. The Soviet Union's position is different from any country and has special significance.

Italy declared "non-participation in the war," but it is clear that she is an ally of Germany; Spain declared "neutrality," but in attitude, she is biased towards Germany. - These two countries are one type.

Turkey declared "loyalty" to the British and French alliance treaties, but did not participate in the war; Romania, in fact, is equal to an ally of Britain and France, but declared "neutrality." - These two countries are another type.

After removing the above thirteen political units, there are twenty-two political units remaining in Europe. Among them, there are two that have not yet formally declared "neutrality." - Hungary, Greece.

The rest have all declared so-called "neutrality" one after another. Here are the attitudes of three of the more important countries among them.

Belgium - Belgium, which suffered from the misfortune of being caught in the crossfire in the last European war, is once again bearing the brunt. Theoretically, for strategic reasons, the belligerent countries that drag her into the vortex are more likely to be Germany. Therefore, starting from this assumption, her defenses are entirely facing the German side. However, in fact, Britain and France, which subjectively hope that she will join the vortex, are not inferior to Germany, because they estimate that if Belgium does not join, then it will be, if she joins, it must be on the side of Britain and France, that means to say, the British and French side can immediately have another ally. Therefore, recently the propaganda of Britain and France and the propaganda of Germany have become two interesting contrasts. Germany is trying its best to deny any intention to invade Belgium. On the contrary, it says that Britain and France want to violate her neutrality; at the same time, it is doing its best to encourage her to resist. Following that, it released a threat: "If Belgium acquiesces in Britain and France destroying her neutrality, then Germany also has the right to take convenient action and no longer has any obligation to respect her neutrality." On the British and French side, they are reminding her of the lessons of the last European war every day, encouraging her to prepare for the German invasion, and saying: "Belgium can rest assured that on the first day the German army sets foot on Belgian territory, the British and French allied forces will be able to come to the rescue immediately." However, standing on Belgium's position, she has no ambition to expand her territory, nor does she want to offer her territory as someone else's battlefield. Therefore, her most advantageous path is to be a truly "neutral" to the end. Therefore, the propaganda and pressure from both sides of the belligerent countries are things that make her "painful." When Britain, France and Germany declared war, Belgium also immediately issued a general mobilization order nationwide, not to prepare to join any side to fight, but indeed to prepare to "guarantee its own neutrality."

The Shanghai Women's Table Tennis movement, through the efforts of the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) at 999 Jing'an Temple Road for the past year, has gained widespread attention from society.

### Finance: Chinese Merchants Selling Foreign Exchange En Masse

In yesterday's foreign exchange market, HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged. The underground market for British and American currencies showed a persistent downward trend, especially the US dollar today, which was particularly weak. This was mainly due to a sharp rise of more than 1 jiao and 3 fen in the exchange rate between British and American currencies in the early morning. Trading was lively throughout the day, with Chinese banks such as Huaqiao and Shanghai selling foreign exchange en masse, which was the main reason for the weakening. However, there were no reports of Chinese speculators entering or leaving the market, resulting in a shortage of scalpers. The strongest US dollar in the morning was 6.125 yuan, with the closing price remaining stable. In the afternoon, the market became increasingly rigid. Chinese banks quoted 6.125 yuan and 6 yuan for six-seven month swaps, indicating a discount of 0.125 yuan. Furthermore, the Japanese Yokohama Specie Bank (Y.S.K.) also sought to sell a considerable amount of spot US dollars, with the price reaching 6.15625 yuan at one point. However, American banks absorbed a significant amount, causing the price to slightly recover after the weakening. As a result, the closing prices were 3 shillings 9.6875 pence for British gold and 6.09375 yuan for the US dollar. Compared to the closing prices last Saturday, British gold remained unchanged, while the US dollar rose sharply by 0.125 yuan. Futures also remained firm.

Foreign Banks Also Intend to Sell

In the early morning, the exchange rates between British and American currencies remained unchanged, and the rate against Shanghai was also stable. The rate against France did not change. The exchange rate between American and British currencies rose by 1 jiao and 3.75 fen, while the rate against Shanghai rose sharply by 2 jiao. There was no change in the rate against France. The central bank's listed exchange rates, such as those of the Bank of China, opened with a spot selling price of 3 shillings 9.375 pence for British gold and 6.0625 yuan for the US dollar, which was 0.03125 pence tighter for British gold and 0.09375 yuan harder for the US dollar compared to the closing prices last Saturday evening. This was due to the sharp rise in exchange rates. After the opening, Chinese banks came to sell, causing the market to become harder. It was reported that Chinese banks sold US dollars for July to foreign and American banks at prices ranging from 5.9375 yuan to 5.96875 yuan. Later, the Shanghai branch of Chinese banks even sold US dollars for the same month at 6 yuan. The HSBC's listed prices were announced and remained unchanged. The announcement of the silver equalization tax also showed no increase or decrease. After that, foreign and American banks were also filled with intentions to supply, so the price became more volatile. It was reported that foreign banks, including Arnhold & Co. and American banks, purchased British gold for June at 3 shillings 9.6875 pence. At that time, the strongest US dollar had already reached 6.125 yuan. However, the market stabilized shortly after American banks and others stopped selling. By the time of the noon close, British gold was at 3 shillings 9.6875 pence, and the US dollar was at 6.09375 yuan, the same prices as the spot prices for June. British gold for July was at 3 shillings 9.0625 pence, and the US dollar was at 5.96875 yuan, which was 0.03125 pence weaker for British gold and 0.03125 yuan harder for the US dollar compared to the opening spot prices. Futures remained firm across the board.

US Dollar Drops Sharply by 0.125 Yuan

After the afternoon opening, the market remained rigid. It was reported that Chinese banks swapped US dollars for this month at 6.125 yuan and for July at 6 yuan, indicating a discount of 0.125 yuan. Subsequently, the Japanese Yokohama Specie Bank (Y.S.K.) came to the market to sell spot US dollars at a low price of 6.15625 yuan. Although the Japanese bank sold a considerable amount, the American banks absorbed a significant amount, causing the price to recover slightly. As a result, British gold was at 3 shillings 9.6875 pence, and the US dollar was at 6.09375 yuan. British gold for July was at 3 shillings 9.0625 pence, and the US dollar was at 6 yuan, which was the same for British gold and 0.125 yuan harder for the US dollar compared to the closing spot prices last weekend.

### Interest in Holding Gold is Weak: Only Scalping Transactions

Yesterday, cash gold speculation in the underground market was sluggish and unable to gain momentum. The exchange market's downward trend and the lack of positive news reduced operators' interest in holding gold. There were only scalping transactions. The result of the transactions showed weakness from the early morning. The opening price was 80 yuan lower at 5,430 yuan. Banks and securities firms sold one after another, pushing the price down to a low of 5,350 yuan. Later, with the support of certain money exchange businesses, the price recovered to 5,475 yuan, but transactions were extremely rare. The noon closing price was 5,400 yuan. The opening price in the afternoon was only 5,390 yuan, and under the continued selling by securities firms and banks, the price fell again to 5,350 yuan. As a result, with the support of money exchange businesses and certain banks buying, the price closed at 5,400 yuan, down 110 yuan from last Saturday. After the closing, the price slightly dropped to 5,390 yuan. Later, there were rumors from French and Japanese sources, so the final price was 5,430 yuan. There was a fluctuation of 125 yuan throughout the day, and the trading volume was relatively strong, about 3,000 taels. Jewelry gold was listed 20 yuan lower, while customs gold remained unchanged.

Cash Squeezed Down by 110 Yuan

Since the morning, each bar (10 taels), initially with the sharp rise in exchange rates and the US dollar reported weakening, caused people to feel exhausted. The market opened with a sharp drop of 80 yuan, with gold shops and money exchange businesses selling 20 taels at 5,430 yuan. Subsequently, with the support of certain banks and securities firms, the price briefly rebounded by 30 yuan, with banks mutually trading 10 taels at 5,460 yuan. However, as foreign exchange continued to weaken, another bank and certain gold shops competed to dump and push the price down by 110 yuan, with banks and money exchange businesses selling 30 taels at a low of 5,350 yuan. After that, certain banks continued to buy and add to their positions, and with the foreign exchange market slightly turning around, general retail short sellers came to cover their positions. At the same time, gold shop assistants also came to search for purchases, pushing the price back above the 5,400 yuan mark. Banks mutually traded 20 taels at 5,475 yuan. The market situation turned downward again at noon, as certain gold shops remained filled with intentions to sell, and the price declined by several tens of yuan again. Gold shops sold 20 taels to banks at 5,400 yuan. The situation remained sluggish when the market opened in the afternoon, with securities firms selling a total of 10 taels to banks, pushing the price down to 5,390 yuan. Subsequently, as securities firms continued to unload, and certain money exchange businesses also sold, the price fell another 20 yuan, with securities firms selling 30 taels to gold shops at 5,370 yuan. Later, as gold shops came to buy, and sellers decreased, the price rebounded by 25 yuan, with gold shops buying 20 taels from securities firms at 5,395 yuan. At that time, securities firms re-expressed intentions to sell, and certain banks followed suit by short selling, pushing the price down by 45 yuan. Certain banks sold 20 taels to jewelry shops at 5,350 yuan. Afterwards, people's sentiment gradually changed, buyers increased, and money exchange businesses and banks frequently bought, pushing the price back up by 50 yuan, with banks mutually trading 30 taels at 5,400 yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, the price fell by 110 yuan compared to last weekend, with a fluctuation of 125 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of cash gold at the main brands of gold shops was about ten yuan higher than speculation, while the purchasing price was 30 yuan lower. The current standard gold was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there were few transactions.

Jewelry Gold Listed at 550 Yuan

Initially, jewelry gold for sale at major gold shops was still listed at 570 yuan per tael. At 9:35 AM, the price was reduced by 10 yuan, and at 2:30 PM in the afternoon, the price was reduced by another 10 yuan. After that, there were no changes. It was reported that major gold shops changed the listing to 550 yuan, with new shops having the same price as the previous price, and the purchasing price was reduced by about 30 yuan.

### Discount Rate Rebounds by Two Yuan

Yesterday, the discount rate for exchange bills of exchange showed a slight rebound, with the discount rate for every thousand yuan starting at 75 yuan and requiring 80 yuan for selling, a rebound of 2 yuan compared to the previous day. The interbank lending rate of the Money Exchange Association also rose by 1 fen, reaching 0.26 yuan.

### Foreign Currencies Soften

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw speculation suddenly trending lower, with British and American gold pounds falling in tandem. The supply and demand for British gold notes was relatively balanced, and the market price remained stable. American gold notes initially retreated to 16.2 yuan due to a sudden increase in the price of the pound in the morning, and although they rose twice to 16.5 yuan, they eventually trended lower, resulting in a drop of 0.15 yuan compared to last Saturday. The supply of Hong Kong notes was strong, and the market price was very soft. There was no shortage of supply of Robi notes and Philippine notes, and the market price fell. The supply and demand for Japanese gold notes was even, and the market price remained stable, with the evening price at 1.09 yuan. There was slightly more demand for Korean notes, and the market price rose slightly, with the evening price at 0.96 yuan.

### Foreign Rice Plummets by 1-2 Yuan: Japonica Rice Insists on Not Weakening; Let's See the Determination of the Tin Rice Merchants

Since the report last week that South Seas shipping for foreign rice could pass smoothly and that there was no blockade of goods at the coastal defense, the foreign rice market would have shown signs of weakness if there were no brisk sales in the mainland. Yesterday, the market opened with a day off for the week, and people's minds were still difficult to grasp, all showing a wait-and-see attitude. Suddenly, the way to Zhejiang Province in the mainland, with a certain party issuing that the transportation of rice on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line must obtain a passport from today, the general Hakka people reported that the formalities had not been completed, and that there would be an additional fee, they all stopped. The market situation was unusually deserted as a result. At this time, floating speculators, seeing that the situation was not good and that the price was high and dangerous, no longer remained silent and began to sell at discounted prices. For a time, there was a rush to sell each other, and the quoted prices fell frequently. Saigon No. 2 was only 61.5 yuan, Bank Warehouse was slightly squeezed to 60.05 yuan, and Shanghai Pudong Warehouse was at 60.03 yuan, and Tokyo's top rice was at 59.5 yuan. By the afternoon, new orders for foreign rice had been confirmed, and Shenji Foreign Company dumped 1,850 tons of Siam No. 2 rice to be shipped on the 26th of this month, priced at only 64.3 yuan, which was 3-4 yuan cheaper than the recycled goods on the market. People's minds were weak, profits were fully released, speculation disappeared, and the market plummeted by 1-2 yuan. There were several rounds of hovering, but the result was still soft. In addition, with the showers, the acceptance by importers was also sluggish. The evening closing prices for Siam No. 2 and Tribute No. 2 rice were only around 61 yuan, with Bank Warehouse slightly squeezed to 60.034 yuan, and a few small traders in a hurry to sell even lowering their prices to below 60 yuan, at 59.8 yuan. Early market prices for recycled Siam No. 2 18-bag rice were 67 yuan, down 1.5 yuan from Saturday, and then ranged from 67.5 yuan to 68 yuan, but there was also a lack of demand in the evening market. The total number of futures recycled throughout the day was 250 tons, and there were 8,000 bags in stock.

Also, according to news, foreign rice continued to arrive in Shanghai. The Taikoo Company's Guangdong ship arrived in Shanghai last Saturday, transporting 20,008 bags from Hong Kong, which were unloaded yesterday. The company's Xinjiang ship also arrived on the 23rd, also carrying 11,784 bags from Hong Kong, which were docked at the company's wharf in Pudong for unloading. (Zu)

Although the arrival of Japonica and Glutinous national rice was continuous, it was not large, only nearly 1,000 bags in total. Due to the heavy rain, the underground market for Japonica rice was still strong, and it was not affected by foreign rice or rainfall. There were still many transactions, and the selling price was similar to the previous price. Changbang's special clear Japonica rice was 75 yuan, Su Kun and Changzhou Japonica rice were 73-74 yuan, Qingsi's special thin rice was 73-74 yuan, large-grain rice was 71-72 yuan, and old rice was 70 yuan. Nangang's early rice was 69 yuan. The sales market for Glutinous rice turned inferior, and the situation was not as firm as before, with the price depreciating by about half a yuan. Early Kimli special yuan rice was 60 yuan, Dan Chang Baiyuan rice was 58-59 yuan, and Jiangbei goods were around 57 yuan.

The Wuxi Rice Milling Industry Association held a meeting on the 20th and decided to advise fellow traders to sell their stocks as much as possible to meet the market demand, and also agreed on a limited price of 20.5 yuan per dan for Japonica rice, 40 yuan per shi for coarse Japonica rice, and 43 yuan for white Japonica rice, and not to increase the price again, in order to maintain the people's food supply. Each rice factory must be responsible for automatically refusing large-scale purchases by certain merchants and transporting them out of the country. If anyone violates the agreement, the industry's transactions will be suspended, and all factories and businesses will comply with the agreement with full stamps. (Zhi)

### Noodles Rise by Half a Yuan

Flour: The plate of Factory No. 2 flour yesterday rose from 13.8 yuan to 14.3 yuan, adding half a yuan steeper than before. The reason for the rise was that the Chinese factories were affected by the obstruction of new wheat, and the raw materials were about to run out, and there was a situation where there was no goods to supply. Remedial measures have been discussed and agreed upon, and it has been resolved that all guest traders and hoarders will stop selling, and the normal supply will be provided according to the current actual sales volume of this street. Therefore, the factory plate will be actually increased. However, with the current high price of rice, the sales volume in this street is increasing day by day, and the direct distribution by the factory is no less than 10,000 bags. Recycled goods are even more profitable due to the increase in the factory plate. The asking price for Lao Che Pi is 15 yuan, and the asking price for Lu Pao Che and Tian Zhu and other flours is 17 yuan, but they are not formal market prices.

Also, it has been found that since the price of rice has been expensive, flour has attracted the attention of the general public, and the factory's production is limited, and there is a situation where they are unable to meet the demand. It is heard that Tianjin has ordered more than 100,000 bags of Australian flour and foreign flour, and local grain merchants have also ordered foreign flour. It is said that the Tianjin side has ordered Australian flour, and the local side has ordered American flour, estimated at more than 50,000 bags, and the price is 15.5 yuan, which is considered cheap.

Wheat: Yesterday's wheat supply still failed to return to normal, and the Japanese factories have repeatedly received supplies, and their situation is special and cannot be compared with the same day, while the Chinese factories, in view of the current harsh environment, cannot directly purchase from the producing areas, and have no choice but to release prices and start purchasing from grain merchants, businesses, and a certain party. It is heard that yesterday, Fufeng Factory received more than 500 bags of new wheat from Wuhu and Jiangbei, priced at 24.3 yuan to 24 yuan.

### Securities: Domestic Debt Remains Mediocre

Yesterday's market price for securities remained in an uninspired state, with rises and falls inconsistent. Domestic bonds once reached as high as 50 yuan, and the high price summoned sellers, but the price then entered the customs again in the afternoon, but Class A bonds were raised to 61 yuan again. The environmental situation changed in many ways, and it was difficult to know whether there were positive or negative factors. The sluggishness of the market was partly due to the gradual reduction of floating buyers, and the floating sellers fluctuated uncertainly, and partly because the situation was extremely chaotic, rumors arose, and the principal and interest payments of the government bonds themselves could still be advanced by the bank. With a mixture of joy and sorrow, they restrained each other, so every day they continued to fluctuate in a small range. Yesterday's transactions on both markets were nothing more than scalping transactions by a few people on the trading floor, and the turnover was still only more than 300,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.

Stock trading: 50 shares of Bank of China were traded at a price of 69.75 yuan.

Also, the stock market of the Public Works Association yesterday showed little change, and the shares of Yinglian and Yihuo were the most popular.

### Yarn & Cotton: After South Sales Were Blocked, There is Talk of Maintaining Yarn Prices

The yarn market is again flat and sluggish, but the trend is slightly more stable, but actual transactions are relatively light. This is because the Hong Kong border is constantly harassed by the Japanese army, and transportation to the mainland is becoming more difficult, and people's hearts are depressed. However, in eastern Zhejiang, procurement has been active recently, but the amount is very small. However, the degree of decline has been deep, and some people have come out to buy and maintain the market. Otherwise, there may be branches in June.

Due to the firm and high popularity for ten days, the opening price of current yarn was also good, and the price of 20s Double Horse yarn was 990 yuan. Unexpectedly, as soon as the high price opened, sellers came in droves, and because the Guangbang business was also suspended, the situation was even more virtual, and it fell straight to 940 yuan. In an instant, the number of buyers increased again, and many said that the factory came out to buy and maintain the market, so a downward trend was recovered and rose to 960 yuan again, and the closing price was 953 yuan. However, after the closing, the price reached 966 yuan. It was found that the transaction statistics for half a day were 1,480 bales, and the market fell by 24 yuan. The amount of each bank's purchase is listed on the left.

Hong Kong 70 Same industry 1,270

Ningbo 140 Total 1,480

### Factory Offices Suspended: Cotton Underground Market Also Small

The current cotton situation is still sluggish and has no characteristics, and the outside world's mood is very weak, because there is no demand from all parties. At the same time, the cotton yarn market is depressed, and factories are not active. Although there are one or two private deals, the amount is very small, and the market is also cheap.

Another message is that the outside cotton market price, the New York cotton market, is very quiet. With the purchase of Wall Street in the market, and the purchase of spot merchants, the market turned active, and the result closing price rose eight or nine pounds more than the seventh. The Indian market was firm, and yesterday it rose more than 4 Robbie.

The Shanghai cotton trade has been very dull in recent days, and the minds of all parties are weak. The current spot price has been cheaper than the futures price of foreign companies, and still lacks people to inquire. According to the current market situation, I do not know when it will turn around.

### Silk & Tea: Tin Cocoon Merchants Are Scams: Received Cocoon from Farmers; Did Not Send Money to Farmers

There are more than 300 large and small cocoon shops in the three counties of Xiwu and Cheng, most of which collect cocoons on behalf of the "China Central Company." At that time, a contract was established to falsely establish a fresh cocoon price list. If the orchid price rose and fell, it would be calculated according to the report. At the time of payment, except for a small amount of deposit paid first at the time of ordering, the rest will be paid in silver when the dry cocoons are transported to the city. At the time of weighing, due to the special circumstances, the cocoon shops still issued joint tickets as in the previous year, and the date of distribution was announced, stating that the dry cocoons were transported to the city, received the money, and returned home to pay. Now that most of the dry cocoons have been transported to the city, each line has requested the "China Central Company" to pay and settle accounts as agreed. The issue of cocoon prices has not yet been settled, and there are tens of thousands of households in the countryside who hold joint tickets, because cash has not yet been received, and they have been sitting and demanding money from the cocoon shops. The main cocoon shops cannot deal with this situation, and they have gathered in Wuxi to discuss and negotiate with the "China Central Company." If a solution is not quickly sought, there will still be dry cocoons left in the countryside, and it will be difficult to transport them to the city. In this case, the farmers' hard work of raising silkworms will be in vain. (Liang)

### Wuxi Silk Comes to Shanghai: Taxed 300 Yuan: The Industry Seeks Countermeasures

Although the Wuxi silk coming to Shanghai has not actually been subjected to a donation of 12%, it has been greatly restricted. Several pieces of silk have already obtained a transfer certificate (the so-called pass), which requires a pass fee of 300 yuan in legal tender per dan. After July, a special donation of nearly 600 yuan will be required. Yesterday, the silk factory industry association specially convened a meeting to seek countermeasures.

### Japanese Silk Falls

There was no market in New York yesterday, and the price of Yokohama silk fell. The spot price was 1,445 yuan, down 15 yuan, the near-term price was 1,451 yuan, down 20 yuan, and the long-term price was 1,510 yuan, down 17 yuan. The local silk market was quiet, and there seemed to be no hope of expansion.

Also, 50 boxes of rayon arrived from Hong Kong yesterday.

### All Tea Exports Have Stopped

The sales of black and green tea in foreign shops in this city have completely stopped in recent days. Since Italy implemented its participation in the war, shipping in the Mediterranean has been interrupted. Recently, all foreign companies have returned the tea boxes they reported to customs, causing people to lose heart and there is no transaction. However, the domestic sales of tea have slightly improved in the north recently. Recently, the Tianjin traders have searched for 1,800 bags of Maofeng Yushui Hongmei and other goods, which will be shipped soon.

### Piece Goods: Eastern Goods Rebound: National Cloth Rises

National Cloth: The cloth market rose slightly yesterday. After the recent sharp fall in cloth prices, the Eastern Piece Goods rebounded strongly, and the market atmosphere has changed greatly with rain in various places. The demand in this street is gradually increasing, and the guest merchants have also absorbed it. The selling plate is average, and the falling trend has been curbed. The volume of rough cloth traded on this street was more than 200 pieces, and the volume of unbleached cloth and dyed cloth was nearly 300 pieces. Wen Yong traders traded more than 100 pieces of fine twill rough cloth, and Hong Kong traders traded 50-60 pieces of fine twill fine cloth. North Road Qingdao Tianjin and other traders traded more than 200 pieces of bleached cloth, blue cloth, and line cloth. 154 pieces of ramie cloth were shipped from Ningbo yesterday.

Eastern Cloth: The rising trend continued. The opening price of Longtou fine cloth in the morning was 31.5 yuan per piece. Because the Qinhuangdao traders purchased it, people in this street were optimistic and the demand to cover shorts was very strong. The price continued to rise, and the closing price at noon was 32.5 yuan. The black market rose to 33 yuan in the black market. Serge rose to 89 cents. The foreign company opened more than 300 pieces of fine cloth for next month in the morning, with prices ranging from 33.5 yuan to 34.25 yuan.

### Western Woolen Cloth: Goods Are Scarce and Prices Are Expensive

Western woolen cloth, regardless of whether it is light, heavy, thin or thick, English-made, French-made, Italian-made, Polish-made, or local goods, is in short supply and expensive. The autumn and winter goods that need to be sold in the second half of the year are especially in short supply. The firms that have existing goods in hand are all taking the opportunity to hoard them, and they all ignore the tightening of exchange rates and how the domestic and international situation will change. People are always optimistic, and now that the Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou traders continue to open businesses, the various single traders are buying and cutting prosperously, but transportation is difficult, and ways will be found later.

### Oil Cakes: Trends Differ

Yesterday, the oil cake market had different trends. With the help of rain, soybean cakes boosted people's hearts a lot, and the procurement from all parties was enthusiastic, so the market rose by 0.2 yuan. It was reported that 4,000 pieces of Dayou Fourth Brand cakes were traded at a price of 12.6 yuan to 12.65 yuan. 3,000 pieces were ordered for delivery at the end of the month at a price of 12.7 yuan. 6 cars of Feizi cakes were priced at 12.15 yuan to 12.2 yuan. 5,000 pieces of Shengji cakes were priced at 12.1 yuan to 12.3 yuan. 2,000 pieces of Qingzhong cakes were priced at 11.3 yuan. Due to the lack of actual sales, soybean oil was of little interest for speculation. Although a part was forcibly supported, the main market was still sluggish as usual. 70 barrels of Dalian soybean oil were traded, and the price is detailed in the market price column. 10 barrels of Qingdao soybean oil, 50 dans of Pudong factory soybean oil, and 100 dans of Dayou factory soybean oil were traded. Peanut oil was flat and sluggish, and canned oil was procured by Hong Kong traders, so it was flat, while the only movement in the market for barrel oil was in this street, so the market was still sluggish. Yesterday, 150 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were traded at a price of 69 yuan, down 0.5 yuan from the previous price. 800 cans of Jiangbei local oil were priced at 100 yuan from the original plate, and 10 barrels of Qingdao barrel oil were priced at 96 yuan.

### Coal White Coal Prices Remain Unchanged

Although white coal prices were once strained due to rumors of a naval blockade, and dark market prices rose sharply, the market remained unchanged yesterday due to sufficient reserves in the city and no fear of supply shortages. The inter-dealer clearance prices were as follows: Hongji white coal was 216 yuan per ton, No. 1 small coal was 114 yuan, Tongdeli No. 1 and 2 lump coal was 210 yuan per ton, Hongji white coal dust was 140 yuan. All of the above are ex-warehouse prices with delivery by one's own truck. Delivery adds to the transaction cost.

### Sugar Market Foreign Sugar Prices Fluctuate

Yesterday, the sugar market trended downwards due to fewer imports, resulting in a slight drop in prices. The association's listed price for spot 24 crude white sugar was 69.3 yuan outside the warehouse. Small triangular, re-exported goods for July 2 delivery were 55.5 yuan (small amount). For immediate warehouse receipts, the price was 54.85 yuan (small amount). Taikoo Che Bai West Warehouse B mark was 80.5 yuan, and East Warehouse was 80 yuan, with no changes. Dutch red sugar also remained stable at 59.5 yuan. For domestic sugar, a Guangzhou dealer offered 100 bags of high-quality Hainan red sugar at 52 yuan, which was settled at 51.5 to 50 yuan. A few dozen bags of Diao Qing sugar, Chaozhou specifications, were priced at 62.8 yuan. Yesterday, 360 bags of sugar arrived from Hong Kong.

### North-South Goods Pickled Bamboo Shoots Decline

Recently, the price of pickled bamboo shoots has declined because yellow mold growth can be washed away, and the producing areas can still use bamboo rafts for transportation. It is expected that the supply will be smooth. Recently, six to seven hundred pieces have arrived, so the price has dropped. Yesterday, the market price was 3.2 yuan per small basket for early shoots, 3 yuan for fat shoots, and 2.6 yuan for bald shoots, which is a decrease of 7 to 8 jiao compared to the highest price.

### Metals After the Price of Foreign Nails Fell, New Coiled Wire Followed

The new coiled wire market has been in a slump since the price of foreign nails fell. Recently, the situation in Vietnam and southern China has become increasingly serious, and merchants there have no time to purchase goods. The only large sales market for foreign nails is the islands of Southeast Asia and the major commercial ports of the South China Sea. Now that the situation has greatly changed, there are no goods to be shipped for foreign nails, and the various merchant groups are also unwilling to purchase them. Therefore, the foreign nail market situation has been severely impacted. Although the local construction industry and retail buyers occasionally make purchases, the volume is small. Therefore, the trend in the nail market is very poor, and the price has fallen from 65.5 yuan to around 60 yuan, causing the new coiled wire market price to follow suit. Yesterday, the market price was 55 yuan per dan (unit of weight), also falling by 4 yuan or so.

Health for Both Sexes

### For Those Who Masturbate Excessively Secret Therapy for Post-Marital Sexual Weakness by Dr. Huang Zhongchang, American Medical Doctor

The most significant hidden concern facing young people is improper sexual behavior. Masturbation is also one of the abnormal sexual behaviors. Not only do young men have this habit, but many women also secretly engage in it.

It must be understood that if there is no sexual behavior as a medium, love will weaken. As the Western proverb says, "A man seeks a woman's love, and a woman grants a man her body." This is indeed true. Then, how can a woman willingly grant her body to her husband? From this perspective, any young person who masturbates excessively, if they do not know the harm and abstain, and try their best to seek treatment, sexual neurasthenia after marriage is inevitable, and the breakdown of love is to be expected. In severe cases, wives often seek other partners because they are deprived of sexual relations for a long time. Therefore, weak husbands and strong wives often have adulterous affairs. Ancient Chinese poets compared the harmony of husband and wife to the zither and lute. Therefore, the poem says, "Husband and wife are harmonious, like playing the zither and lute." This is indeed a worthwhile saying. The sensations of both parties must be coordinated, and they must have the same sensitivity to sexual feelings. When one party's pleasure reaches its peak, the other party's pleasure must also reach its peak, just like the resonance of the zither and lute. Only then can their harmony be permanent.

The harm of masturbation and the importance of sexual power have been described above. Therefore, if we feel kidney deficiency and other kinds of neurasthenia, spinal cord neurasthenia, etc. after marriage, they will also erupt one after another, and life will also feel endangered. Therefore, the method of treatment must start from increasing essence and nourishing blood, and take the German Juwan Essence Preparation "Buti Kang" for men, which can physiologically promote the function of metabolism and increase new essence and blood. In the medical community, it has long been recognized as an effective medicine for treating sexual neurasthenia. The testicular hormones extracted from animals are carefully and scientifically refined. Its female version can regulate menstruation and promote fertility. I have used it clinically for nine years and have never encountered a case where it was ineffective.

### Treatment Report for Kidney Deficiency Syndrome

— Dr. Zheng Ting, German Medical Doctor

Patient Xia Minggang, 33 years old, married at the age of 24. Due to licentious behavior before marriage and indulgence after marriage, his energy has declined in recent years, and symptoms of sexual neurasthenia have appeared in various forms. Not only has he lost erectile power, but his face is pale, he is as thin as a rail, and his weight is only 91 pounds. Knowing that if he does not seek treatment early, the consequences will be dire, he came to the hospital for treatment. (Symptoms at the time of diagnosis) - Impotence, neurasthenia, spermatorrhea, married for eight years, never had children, often had headaches, tinnitus, palpitations, etc. during the day, and insomnia and night sweats at night. (Treatment method) - Ordered him to strictly observe health preservation, abstain from sex in the short term, and in addition to taking nutritious foods, also gave him face-to-face health preservation methods. He was given 3 tablets of the German testicular essence preparation "Buti Kang" for men every day, and 3 tablets of the anti-seminal emission drug "Nairesi Huanjing Pian" before going to bed. After one month, spermatorrhea and seminal emission had stopped, his appetite increased, and his weight increased by only one pound. After two months, neurasthenia and insomnia had stopped, his complexion was ruddy, and his weight increased by another 1.5 pounds. After three months, his weight increased by 4 pounds. After four months, kidney deficiency and impotence were completely cured. After half a year, his weight had increased by a total of 10 pounds, and all symptoms disappeared, so he stopped taking the medicine.

### The Cause and Effect of Gonorrhea and its Treatment

— Dr. Wang Kechun, German Medical Doctor

The changes in gonorrhea are numerous, but there are clues to its cause and effect that can be found. With these clues, an experienced doctor, with his excellent treatment methods, can perform a fundamental treatment, and the eradication of gonorrhea is not difficult. If the changes in gonorrhea are due to the unrestricted destruction of gonococci in our body, those who do not quickly eliminate gonococci in the anterior urethra will inevitably develop posterior urethritis. If posterior urethritis is not treated quickly, it will become prostatitis, orchitis, arthritis, etc. These symptoms occur because the treatment to eliminate gonococci is not thorough. According to my analysis of the actual experiments of various oral medications, only the latest chemical therapy "New Kelinon" (available in Chinese and English) can be used as an oral agent to directly deliver bactericidal power to the lesion and eliminate all gonococci. Because "New Kelinon" is a chemical therapy for gonorrhea, it specifically eliminates gonococci, and it is very different from general chemical therapies, which have very strong reactions and are not purely effective. Originally, this "New Kelinon" was invented by Dr. Peter of Germany and has been proven by many experts in various countries that this drug can cure all new and old gonorrhea. For external use, "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" can be used to wash the urethra according to the diagram, which is even more effective.

### Gonorrhea Lecture

Dr. Yao Juyan's Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, intersection of Sichuan Road

The Harm of Incompletely Cured Gonorrhea

I have been treating gonorrhea for more than twenty years. For gonorrhea, if the patient can completely trust my treatment method, I will do my best to treat it completely and fundamentally until it is cured, and I will never perform an incomplete and perfunctory treatment to shirk responsibility. However, in general, patients are often impatient, thinking that I can achieve great results in a few days, and thinking that the disease has subsided, they no longer come to me for treatment. As a result, the gonorrhea that was about to be cured falls short, and it recurs. Not only is all previous effort wasted, but the disease is more severe than before. Patients often come back to ask me for treatment. Although I can still be responsible for the radical cure, the treatment time is inevitably extended. In terms of treatment methods, all unreasonable treatments should be discarded, and the most scientific treatment methods should be used to completely eliminate the gonococci in the chronic phase from the deep and widespread areas, leaving no disease behind to avoid recurrence. To achieve this goal of complete cure, only the great invention of the gonorrhea-specific drug "New Kelinon" (available in Chinese and English) and German inductive electrostatic therapy, X-ray therapy, can fundamentally eradicate it. Because the bactericidal power of "New Kelinon" can follow the circulation of the blood to sweep away the gonococci scattered in the body, the gonococci have no way to gain a foothold in our body, and the problem is fundamentally solved. Furthermore, prompt surgery is used to correct the pathological condition, which can achieve the task of complete cure. Also treats syphilis, buboes, chancres, and sexual neurasthenia.

### Self-Treatment of Pulmonary Tuberculosis

— Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang

Pulmonary disease is also called a rich man's disease, because this disease is extremely difficult to cure, and it consumes the patient's economy and physical strength for a long time. If one can withstand the invasion of this bacterium and has the economic power to support it, then this wasting disease is not without hope of a complete cure. Usually, living in a sanatorium is considered the best way to deal with this disease, but this kind of treatment is at least affordable for the average petit bourgeois. The lower classes are mostly unable to afford it. Fortunately, a new method of self-treatment at home has now been invented, that is, taking the pulmonary tuberculosis-specific drug "Pulmonary Nall" invented by Dr. Tume, a German pulmonary disease expert, which can completely cure all stages of pulmonary disease, such as early or second and third stage pulmonary disease. Because "Pulmonary Nall" has the function of directly eliminating tuberculosis bacteria and repairing lung cavities. Those who experience tidal fever, night sweats, hemoptysis, unsmooth sputum expectoration, and poor appetite can all achieve results in a short period of time. It is indeed a divine product for family self-treatment of pulmonary disease.

### French Defense Force and Police Yesterday Evacuated Xujiahui; Japan-puppet Regime and French Side Reached an Agreement Through Negotiations; General Order Within the Town is Still Considered Stable

Before the war, Xujiahui Town in western Shanghai was under the jurisdiction of the municipal government. After the westward retreat of the national army, the French Concession authorities, because the area had a refugee zone and because the French Catholic Church owned a great deal of property in the area, dispatched troops to be stationed there and temporarily set up a police station at the intersection of Ciyou Road and Huizhan Street in the town. They distributed posts at important locations to maintain order, under the administration of the French Concession. For more than two years, they lived in peace. Moreover, because the location was remote and there were not many residents, many factories and institutions moved there during the time when the concession was crowded with people. Therefore, the area actually had the function of regulating the population in the concession, which indirectly helped maintain law and order in the concession. However, the Japan-puppet regime's military police suddenly invaded the area the day before yesterday, causing rumors to arise and people to panic. The situation was quite tense. As seen in yesterday's newspaper, according to further investigation, the French Concession authorities have reached a compromise with the Japan-puppet regime, and starting from 1:00 AM this morning, the area will be handed over to the Japan-puppet regime. The details are recorded below:

Brewing for a Long Time, Agreement Recently Reached

Recently, the Japan-puppet side, using the excuse that there were no more refugees in the area, demanded that the French side withdraw the defense force and police station. It is reported that this negotiation has been conducted between the French Concession authorities and the puppet "municipal government" for many days. Until yesterday, it was completely resolved. The French side, due to the harsh environment and unwillingness to cause disputes, expressed concessions and, starting from 12:00 last night, withdrew the defense force and police station to within the concession. Starting from 1:00 AM this morning, it was handed over to the Japan-puppet side to take over. According to the Japanese military spokesman at a reception for reporters last night, he also admitted that "this issue will be resolved today (i.e., tomorrow)," but he was unwilling to release the details. However, the French Concession authorities and the Japanese embassy spokesman neither confirmed nor denied it.

Residents Hearing the News, Moved One After Another

Since the Japan-puppet regime's military police invaded the area the day before yesterday, yesterday morning, the Japanese army held exercises nearby again. The general residents, because they were worried about what kind of situation would arise, were greatly panicked and moved one after another. Although it rained heavily yesterday afternoon, the number of people moving actually increased. On the various roads in Xujiahui, boxes and vehicles were connected endlessly, all soaked in rainwater. The general residents, supporting the old and carrying the young, all fled towards the concession, whispering to each other, showing a look of panic. As for the temporary police station of the French Concession in the area, after moving the documents and equipment out all night the day before yesterday, only empty houses remained yesterday.

Iron Wire Erected at the Border

The intersection of Haig Road, Avenue Petain, and Xujiahui Road has always been the only thoroughfare between Xujiahui Town and the French Concession. Yesterday, the area was erected with barbed wire by the Japan-puppet regime's military police, leaving only a five-foot-long gap for the entry and exit of trams and pedestrians. However, there were no Japan-puppet personnel stationed at the gap yesterday, so residents were still able to enter and exit freely. As for Haig Road, there were originally two lines of barbed wire, one adjacent to the Chinese area and one in the middle of the concession, which was the road. Now, the barbed wire adjacent to the Chinese area has been completely removed by the Japan-puppet personnel, and even the wooden poles have been pulled out.

Observatory Still Working as Usual

The Xujiahui Observatory in the Xujiahui area is an important place for reporting and observing weather in the Far East. In the future, when all the French police detectives are withdrawn, the work of the observatory is of great concern to the shipping industry. According to inquiries, the observatory worked as usual yesterday and will not be suspended in the future. The weather station and other facilities there cannot be moved, and it has been decided to continue working at the original location. In addition, the Xujiahui Catholic Church, seminary, monastery, and bishop's residence are also not preparing to move.

Situation in the Town Still Considered Peaceful

Yesterday, Japanese military trucks and Japan-puppet military police came and went in Xujiahui Town from time to time. Although many residents were uneasy, the general order was still considered stable. Xuhui Middle School, Xuhui Girls' High School, Qiming Girls' High School, and other schools all had classes as usual yesterday. The Xujiahui French Catholic Church is still safe, and most shops are also open for business as usual. However, at about 2:00 PM yesterday, when it was raining heavily, the extremely long bamboo fence of the Xuhui shelter was suddenly completely demolished by hundreds of poor people and taken back for fuel. Although the Chinese police were stationed beside them, they only watched to avoid causing trouble.

Security Strengthened in the Border Area of the Concession

In order to maintain the tranquility of the western district, the French Concession police authorities specially dispatched a large number of detectives yesterday, distributed at the intersections of Haig Road leading into the concession, and the inspection of pedestrians and vehicles was very strict. At the end of Xujiahui Road, which was blocked by barbed wire by the Japan-puppet regime, there was an armored vehicle and many detectives stationed at the gap, with extremely tight defenses. French police and Annamite police were rarely found in Xujiahui Town yesterday, but White Russian and Chinese police were still maintaining order in various places in the town. There was a rumor locally that there would be a retreat last night, but it could not be confirmed.

### Italian Consul Going North; Danish Consul Temporarily Serves as Leader of the Consular Corps

The English-language China Press reported that the Italian Consul General in Shanghai and leader of the Consular Corps in this city, Mr. Niro, is scheduled to leave Shanghai on the 25th for a three-week vacation in Beidaihe. The Danish Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Hill, will temporarily serve as the leader of the Consular Corps. The post of Italian Consul General will be temporarily held by Mr. Leibeks, an official of the Italian Consulate's court, until Mr. Niro returns to office.

### The Situation of Refugees Awaiting Repatriation in Nanshi is Miserable; Charitable Lottery Tickets are Issued as Usual

The refugees in the Nanshi Refugee Zone, except for the old and weak who were transferred to the Xin Puyu Hall for accommodation, will all be given a month's worth of alms at the end of this month and repatriated. The Rehabilitation Committee of the District has already announced this to all the refugees in the district. It is reported that there are mostly women and children among the refugees in the district, mostly poor households from the suburbs of Shanghai and those who have lived in Nanshi for a long time. One-fifth of the refugees are from distant places. Since Father Jacquinot left Shanghai and the refugee zone is preparing to close, all the refugees in the district feel deeply at a loss, especially the refugees from distant places, who have a feeling of not knowing where to turn. The miserable situation is particularly pitiful. The Charity Lottery, which is the only economic source for the refugee zone, has been decided by the company authorities not to be suspended due to the closure of the refugee zone, because two or three charitable organizations are currently relying on the surplus funds from the lottery for subsidies. At the same time, in these extraordinary times, when the municipal finances are difficult, funds are needed for street beggars and homeless refugees to ensure their well-being. Therefore, it has been decided to continue issuing and making appropriate allocations to increase local public welfare.

### Converting Tribute Rice from Saigon to Hong Kong, then Shipping to Shanghai; Cutting off Transportation is Absolutely Not True; Food Committee to Hold Important Meeting Today

The Food Committee established by the Municipal Council is scheduled to hold a committee meeting at 2:15 PM today. The members of the committee are Marshall (Chairman), Iveley, Grand, Hongk, Hedden, Li Wenzie, Megg, Sugimura. According to a reporter from the New Life News Agency, a certain member of the committee said that today's meeting will discuss how to stabilize the prices of rice and flour and how to dredge the sources of foreign rice and wheat. Once a solution is decided, opinions on this issue will be submitted to the board of directors of the Municipal Council. The meeting notice has already been issued. The Shanghai Price Stabilization Committee has ordered another 20,000 bags of rice from Saigon for the fourth phase of price stabilization, in addition to the 15,000 bags previously stored. The cost of each bag (broken rice) is 54 yuan, excluding all expenses. Three-tenths of the deposit has been paid, totaling 324,000 yuan. The remaining 40,000 bags will be ordered as soon as the deposit is secured. After the additional 20,000 bags arrive in Shanghai around July 15, price stabilization will be launched. Yesterday, the Rice Industry Association and the Miscellaneous Grain Industry Association reiterated the previous order, restricting the weighing and clearing of rice and grain within ten days of the transaction.

The rice problem in this city has recently become serious again. Domestic rice has exceeded the 70 yuan mark, and foreign rice has also exceeded 60 yuan. The livelihood of the poor is worrying. The source of domestic rice is entirely controlled by the Japan-puppet regime. The amount of rice arriving in Shanghai every day cannot be investigated. The foreign rice is shipped from Saigon, Rangoon, Bangkok, and other ports in Vietnam. The soaring rice prices in this city are primarily due to the tightening of foreign exchange and the deliberate increase in prices. The Concession authorities had previously set a price limit of 40 yuan, but in reality, it has already been hovering around the 50 yuan mark. After holding on for several months, unexpectedly, the weather was extremely dry a few days ago, and the armistice between France and Germany caused rumors to spread in Vietnam, which gave speculators a great opportunity to spread rumors, saying that tribute rice could not be shipped to Shanghai and that the transshipment of foreign rice in Hong Kong was also prevented from being exported, etc., which repeatedly and drastically increased rice prices, creating unprecedented new prices. The livelihood of ordinary people cannot be maintained. According to reliable information from the shipping industry, the rice directly shipped from Saigon, Rangoon, and Siam has indeed been very little, but the rice shipped to Hong Kong for transshipment to Shanghai is continuous. Last week, Jardine Matheson & Co.'s Yisheng, Yisheng, and Lisheng lines shipped more than 51,400 sentences. On Saturday, the Taikoo Dockyard Company's Guangdong Wheel shipped 20,008 bags. On Sunday (the 23rd), the Xinjiang Wheel loaded another 11,774 bags, so the source will definitely not be interrupted. It is reported that the Java Company's Shibosha wheel is scheduled to ship rice directly from Saigon to Shanghai today. In addition, due to the recent rain, the five grains are expected to have a bumper harvest, and the old rice in the countryside is being milled one after another. Rice prices fell yesterday, but flour mills have increased their factory price to 14 yuan and 3 jiao.

### The Rice Famine in Xiaoshao is Getting Worse; Xiangshan Reports Famine

The rice famine in Xiaoshao has been getting worse recently. The Xiaoshao Disaster Relief Association in this city received a telegram from the Shaoxing County Chamber of Commerce, Farmers' Association, Labor Union, Education Association, Women's Association, and other county-wide legal entities at 5:00 AM yesterday (the 24th), saying, "All of you are concerned about our homeland and have bestowed rescue. We are deeply grateful. The food famine has become more severe recently. In addition to doing our best to adjust and provide relief, we sincerely request that you quickly raise large sums of money for rescue. We are in dire straits." It is learned that the association has remitted 120,000 yuan to Shao yesterday and sent Wang Qingyun, Hong Wuqi, Chen Yinru, and others to purchase and distribute rice. It is also reported that the association is scheduled to hold a Xiaoshao Disaster Relief Fundraising Conference at the Shaoxing Seven Counties Association of Fellow Townsmen in Shanghai on Avenue Edward VII today. It is believed that the people of Shao are deeply concerned about their homeland and will definitely participate enthusiastically and donate large sums of money. In addition, the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Townsmen Association received an express mail from the Xiangshan County Government yesterday, saying, "Our county has never had enough rice, but we have been able to support ourselves by supplementing it with miscellaneous grains such as wheat, silk, etc. Last year's flood caused a disaster, and the late rice harvest was poor. It has been difficult to maintain the food supply for the entire county. However, neighboring counties, seeing that the prices in our county are lower, have come to purchase, resulting in a situation where supply cannot meet demand. Since the beginning of summer this year, the weather has been extremely dry, and the fields have cracked. About two-thirds of the early rice has not been sown in time. Even those that have been sown have withered seedlings, and it is difficult to expect a harvest. The disaster is already apparent. At present, there is no rice for sale, and tragic events of seizing grain, cutting off food, starving to death, and committing suicide are occurring frequently. According to investigations, Ru Yuyang Lai Aqiao in the west township committed suicide by drinking poisonous herbs because he had many family members, could not afford rice, and had no way to make a living. Zhou Songlai, a family of six in Xiangsi Ling in the east township, cut off food for three days, and his wife and children cried and screamed, secretly drinking brine and committing suicide. Sun Heding's family of five in Banana Sun in the west township cut off food for many days, and one son and one daughter starved to death one after another. Villagers in Zhuang Wu in Xisi Temple, Hutou in the east township, seized more than 100 jin of grain.

Tragic events are occurring frequently. Others, such as abandoning daughters and selling children, are unable to continue eating and prolong their lives by eating grass roots and bark. This is even more common everywhere. The severity of the food panic is actually greater than in the counties of Yong. We should ask your association to consider the people of Yong and provide relief to them as a whole, so as to relieve the disaster and appease our homeland. We are looking forward to it." It is heard that the association has telegraphed to Yong to request allocation.

### British Nationals in This City are Deeply Patriotic; Urge Return to Homeland to Serve; French People Demonstrate in Front of British Consulate in Saigon; Demand that Britain Adhere to the Allied Pledge

Yesterday, a British national sent a letter to the North China Daily News, calling for British nationals in this city to intensify their work and serve their motherland. The letter stated, "According to yesterday's news reports, some British territories and colonies have begun conscription, but this city has never allowed overseas Chinese to leave their professions and concentrate on serving their country. There were rumors here that this city is about to begin recruiting volunteers to enlist in the army, but I believe that this action should be changed to active encouragement so that all those who have reached the age of military service should enlist immediately. At present, there is a great need for a large amount of manpower, and the more people serve their country, the greater the effectiveness of protecting their country. However, Shanghai is not only lagging behind in manpower, but also in material donations. In the past few months, British overseas Chinese all over the world have donated huge sums of money to their country, but the amount donated in Shanghai is still small. British overseas Chinese in this city should also intensify this work. The North China Daily News can be responsible for carrying out fundraising and publicity work in order to achieve great results."

French People in Saigon Demonstrate and March

Foreigners in this city received a radio report from the British Broadcasting Corporation's radio station the night before last, saying that French residents in Saigon held a demonstration in front of the British Consulate General in Saigon, demanding that Britain adhere to its pledge to unite with France and requesting permission for them to immediately enlist in the army and join the Allied forces. The demonstration and march only ended when the British Consul General gave a speech to the crowd on the balcony, guaranteeing that their demands would be submitted to the British government.

Jewish People Pray to Avert Misfortune

The Jewish people in this city received a notice from Dr. Kislev, Chairman of the Far Eastern Jewish Federation in Harbin, that they will fast from dawn tomorrow until half an hour after sunset and hold prayers to avert the misfortune of the Jewish people in Europe. During this period, the Jewish people in this city will fast for one day and recite the Bible and hold prayers at 6:00 PM tomorrow at the Jewish Synagogue at No. 50 Museum Road.

Real Situation of Cholera

According to the Municipal Council's health report, one person contracted cholera in the week before midnight on the 22nd and died immediately, but the person had no fixed address. Two people suffered from choleraic diarrhea and both died.

### Puppet "Market" Merged

Shanghai Foodstuffs Market One, which is presided over by a certain party, and the "Shanghai Central Market," which is presided over by the puppet party, are trending towards an antagonistic position. The daily turnover of the "Central Market" has dropped from about 40,000 yuan to just over 10,000 yuan. It is now heard that after mediation by a certain party's "special service agency," the "Foodstuffs Market" announced yesterday that it would move into the "Central Market" from the 24th and operate as usual. In fact, it is a merger in name and in reality.

### American Consul Packer Said, Protect Far Eastern Interests; Washington Authorities Determine Effective Measures

The Tianjin silver issue, the UK and Japan actually reached a compromise, followed by France also accepted the Japanese demands, and stopped China's cargo transportation on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway international passage. What followed was that Japan threatened Hong Kong again and demanded the same treatment on the cargo transportation of the Burma Road. Chinese parties expressed extreme regret for the concessions made by Britain and France, and they are extremely concerned about the US Far Eastern policy. The Pyeongmin News reporter specifically inquired about this matter at the US Consulate General in Shanghai yesterday afternoon. According to Administrative Consul Packer of the consulate, the US policy on the Far East will remain unchanged." The reporter further asked how the US would protect its interests in the Far East, as the current US interests in the Far East are obviously being discriminated against and threatened by the Far East aggressors. Packer replied, "The US government will of course protect its interests in the Far East, and the US authorities in Washington will have their own ways to protect them." The reporter asked again about the exact date of Ambassador Johnson's departure from Chongqing. Packer said, "The US Consulate has not yet received a specific date for the ambassador's arrival in Shanghai."

US Warship Movements

The English-language China Press reported that the USS Pecos, a supply ship of the US Asiatic Fleet, left Qin Huangdao a few days ago after carrying a team of US Marines who had completed their training back to Shanghai. It remained moored until 2:00 PM today (the 24th) and then set sail for Manila. It is heard that the USS Marblehead, a light cruiser of the US Asiatic Fleet, will leave Shanghai this week, or on the 25th, and sail to Qingdao, as usual, to cruise the ports of North China in the summer.

### Carrying Legal Tender to Border Provinces; Ban Cancelled; Travel from Kunming to Hong Kong, Shanghai, Tianjin and Other Places is Still Limited to 500 Yuan

The Ministry of Finance previously formulated measures to prevent the import of special goods by land, sea, and air in order to prevent capital flight and maintain the safety of the exchange market. It stipulated that the transport of gold and silver, gold and silver products, and banknotes to border provinces and borders, or the transport of such items from border provinces and borders to the interior, should be subject to strict restrictions. This measure was approved by the ministry and notified to travelers by the Executive Yuan. Subsequently, in order to strictly restrict the transport of banknotes, the Ministry of Finance separately formulated measures to restrict the export of banknotes, designating (1) that the transport of banknotes from Kunming to Hong Kong, or from the interior through Kunming, Hekou, Hong Kong, and other places to Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places, is limited to 500 yuan per person; (2) that the transport of banknotes from Hekou to Lao Cai should not exceed 20 yuan per person, and that the transport of banknotes from the interior through Hekou to Shanghai and other Chinese places is still limited to 500 yuan per person; (3) that the transport of banknotes from Tengchong to Bhamo is limited to 200 yuan per person; (4) that the transport of banknotes from Kunming or other places to Hekou is limited to 500 yuan; and (5) that the transport of legal tender abroad or to guerrilla areas from the interior is limited to Jiangbai yuan per person, except for those subject to special restrictions. This special project was also approved and telegraphed for implementation. Since the implementation of these measures, people have inevitably been restricted by these regulations when carrying legal tender to the hinterland. The closure will confine legal tender to a small corner. After careful verification, the Ministry of Finance believes that it is inconsistent with the meaning of the regulations and has made changes to the method of transporting banknotes. Except for the transport of gold and silver, gold and silver products, and banknotes out of the country, which should still be handled in accordance with the limited amount stipulated by the ministry, the transport of banknotes from the interior to various border provinces for circulation within the country, which does not involve export, should not be subject to restrictions on the amount, so that both the restriction on the export of legal tender and the need for circulation in various parts of the country can be taken into account. This changed method has been approved by the Executive Yuan and notified.

### Shanghai-Wenzhou Italian Ships Changed to Yueqing; Italian Consulate Has Approved

It is now learned that as a result of the request from shipping merchants, the Italian Consulate has approved the change of ships to Yueqing near Wenzhou. The Baoli Wheel has decided to leave Shanghai as scheduled tomorrow (the 26th), loading cargo and passengers. Inquiries can be made at the ship's office on Beijing Road. In addition, the Italian ship Maberilia Wheel has also decided to change to Yueqing. Other German-Central commercial ships will still operate as usual. The Changde and Deping wheels are also operating normally between Shanghai and Ningbo without any changes.

### Lawyers Association Group Life Insurance; Lawyer Zhang Li's Opinion

The Shanghai Lawyers Association issued a circular to its members to solicit their approval of group life insurance and their opinions on the outline. According to lawyer Zhang Li's opinion, "I, as a member, am extremely in favor of the principle, but I dare not agree with the sentence 'death due to natural causes' in the first clause of the outline. (1) Everyone cherishes life and fears death. No one would attempt to commit suicide or arson for the sake of a thousand yuan insurance payout and equate such things with the same thing. Even if one is unfortunate enough to commit suicide, the pain is even greater than living in the world, and one has no choice but to resort to this last resort. One's situation is already pitiful. Why can't one be given compensation? In other cases, such as those who die in the line of duty (such as Judge Yu) or those who resist violence to the death, even if they are not members of this association, we should express our sympathy. How can we be members of this association, who have paid insurance premiums, and confiscate their insurance benefits? In order to prevent unscrupulous elements from being unworthy of death, this association should make arrangements in advance, or even refuse their insurance application to show restrictions. Therefore, according to my humble opinion, those who die should be given insurance benefits regardless of whether it is natural or accidental, in order to conform to the original intention of this association in handling life insurance."

### The Rise and Fall of Things; The Traces of Prosperity and Decline are Fleeting; Continental Press Reporter's Impressions of Europe; Franco-German Armistice is Reciprocal Revenge; The Root of Future Disaster Has Already Been Conceived

When the news of the Franco-German armistice spread to Shanghai, Mr. Luo Xiaote, an editor of the Continental Press who had traveled in Europe for two and a half years, suddenly returned to Shanghai from the United States, resumed his duties at the office, and published his interesting text, saying, "When Hitler ordered the historic carriage in which the 1918 armistice was signed to be brought back to Berlin, he had already conceived the embryo of another war between Germany and France in the next 50 to 500 years. The French have a memory, and they will never forget anything. They will obtain compensation for any mistake before it is over. In this respect, the French have the spirit of the Chinese. In the past two years, I have traveled between Paris and Berlin, and I have often been filled with nostalgia.

The Palace of Versailles is Deserted

When we passed Versailles, we visited various places of historical interest and visited the Palace of Versailles. Although the palace was deserted, the paintings on the walls were hung as before, and no one dared to destroy them. Among them is the Hall of Mirrors, where the peace conference was held in 1919. The guards in the hall painstakingly pointed out and narrated to us which was the seat of US President Wilson and which were the seats of the German and French representatives.

The Franco-Prussian War was Signed Here

I was quite surprised why the peace conference of the European War was held in this empty and desolate Palace of Versailles instead of in Paris. I asked the guard, and the guard said, "I would like to tell you the reason. The reason why the peace conference was held in the Hall of Mirrors is that this is where the Prussian king forced us to end the Franco-Prussian War and sign the armistice in 1871."

The Same Dining Car; Old Drama Reenacted

He also told me that the long table where the peace conference was held was completely placed in its original place and had not been moved. Now, Hitler is forcing the French to make peace in the same dining car, because this car is where the French repelled the Germans in 1918. However, Mr. Xi is afraid that the French will repeat the old tune in the future and change their minds repeatedly, so he is preventing it in advance and taking the carriage back to Berlin.

German War Booty; The French Demand its Return

A few weeks ago, after visiting Paris, I returned to Berlin and met a German who was about to go to southeastern Germany to join a tank unit. I visited the Linden Memorial to Unknown Heroes with him, and on a platform near a fountain, I found an old-fashioned ammunition transport car. There was a copper plate on the car, and my friend translated its meaning, saying, "The guns on this car are war trophies obtained by the Prussian army in France in 1871. In 1919, at the time of the Paris peace conference, the French had requested the return of the guns, but they were especially preserved in this car. Now, when Hitler is in a whirlwind of activity, will this car in Linden still demand that the French return its guns? If so, then we can believe that in the next war, if the French win, they will definitely demand the return of their guns and empty cars to Paris."

### Banks Engaging in Speculative Business; Ministry Orders Prohibition; Banks Should Set an Example; Employees Should Especially Abide by the Regulations

After the influx of floating capital into Shanghai, speculation has become rampant. It is heard that various commercial banks are using deposits to not only hoard goods but also buy foreign exchange with all their might, ostensibly "protecting deposits" but actually trying to make a fortune from the national crisis. Bank employees, from managers to trainees, are all engaged in speculation, competing to buy foreign exchange and hoard goods, causing social unrest. In addition, many bank employees are buying foreign exchange on behalf of their relatives and friends. Banks themselves and their employees were originally prohibited from engaging in speculative transactions. Now, after obtaining confidential information, the Ministry of Finance has strictly ordered an investigation and prohibition, and ordered that they refuse to underwrite the longest-term mortgages on daily necessities in order to avoid fueling speculation and affecting people's livelihood. Bank employees should abide by the regulations, and banks themselves should set an example in order to prevent malpractice.

### Punishment of Unmarked Stalls Will Not Be Neglected

The Shanhaiguan Road, Xinzha vegetable market stalls numbered 6, 9, 10, 60, 68, 207, 221, 311, and 325, involving nine individuals, were found to have never complied with the Shanghai Municipal Council's regulations to display prices. After investigation by the Council and prosecution in court, each was fined ten yuan on the 21st of this month. Furthermore, the American Vegetable Company (transliterated) at 1253 Jing'an Temple Road was found to be using inaccurate weighing equipment. After investigation and prosecution in court, a fine of thirty yuan was imposed on the same day. Meng Zunting, at 36 Yuanchang Road, was found by the Shanghai Municipal Council's Health Department to be selling unapproved milk. After investigation and prosecution in court, he was fined twenty yuan as a warning on the 21st of this month.

### Overseas Italians Reside Peacefully in Both Concessions

According to a report from the Daguang News Agency's inquiry with the Italian Mail Steamship Company, the Conte Verde has been ordered to cease operations and berth in Shanghai. There has been a proposal to convert it into a floating hotel. However, due to the appropriate docking location not yet being determined, the aforementioned hotel conversion work has not yet commenced. Furthermore, the Italian expatriate population in this city is not large, totaling only about 650 people, residing in both concessions without any unrest. Although the Italian Consulate General has notified expatriates to restrain their behavior to avoid misunderstandings with British and French expatriates, the authorities in both concessions continue to provide protection to the Italian expatriates. Therefore, the Italian expatriates continue to reside as usual, and the relationships are extremely harmonious. Thus, relocating to ships is, in fact, unnecessary at present.

### Barter System of the Trade Commission Builds Creditworthiness, the United States Expresses Trust and Proposes Continued Loans, HSBC Annual Meeting Calls It Economic Progress

The Trade Commission has successively signed barter loan agreements with friendly nations, such as tea from the Soviet Union and tung oil and bristles from the United States. The commission pays off the barter goods and loans in full and on time, maintaining the country's external credit. It has won international praise. For example, because China can fulfill its obligations and deliver the goods as scheduled, American congressmen have proposed continuing loans to China. HSBC praised China's economic situation this year at its annual meeting, which is more advanced than last year. This shows a glimpse of foreign opinion. Therefore, the work of the commission, from the perspective of economic resistance, is indeed an important force, laying the economic foundation of the country.

### Shanghai-Ningbo Shipping Lines Eliminate Gratuities

Since Ningbo restricted the export of passengers, the number of passengers in and out of Shanghai and Ningbo has decreased sharply. The De Ping and other ships operating on this line have decided to waive the gratuities for tea rooms and bars to reduce the burden on passengers and eliminate bad practices.

### Relief for Shanghai West Fire Refugees

The fire in Tiandu Village, Anhe Temple Road, Shanghai West, destroyed more than a dozen shanty houses the day before yesterday. The Buddhist Philanthropic Association sent staff to investigate the disaster yesterday. It was found that twelve families were affected, totaling seventy-three people, especially the five families of Cao Guangshou, Zhang Kunshan, Tang Xicheng, Liu Changde, and Yan Kuan, who were the most distressed. They were unable to rebuild shacks and have been living outdoors for days, which is extremely miserable. In addition to issuing more than 800 congee tickets at any time, the association also funded each of the disaster victims to build a shanty house to provide shelter.

### Brief News

### Suspicious Case of Li Yuying's Sudden Death, Coffin Opened for Examination Yesterday, Hospital Authorities Conceal Report, Deceased's Parents Unaware

Li Yuying, also known as Li Jieru, daughter of Li Shizhen, a Fujianese elderly man in his seventies residing at No. 74, Lane 41, Tao'erfeisi Road in the French Concession, was 31 years old this year, had received higher education, and held celibacy. She had been the head nurse at the Sino-Western Sanatorium at No. 536 Pushi Road for six years. The director of the hospital, Lu Zhong'an, is from Beiping. Lu's son, Lu Zhenqing, 39 years old, serves as the office manager in the hospital. The hospital is a sanatorium, with both Chinese and Western doctors available to provide treatment according to the wishes of the patients. Because Li Yuying had worked in the hospital for a long time, she lived in the hospital, regarding it as her second home. She kept her savings, money, and clothing in the hospital and occasionally returned home to visit her parents. Her family are Christian believers. Li Yuying returned home on the evening of the Dragon Boat Festival this month to visit her parents, and returned to the hospital to sleep at night. When she said goodbye to her family at home, she was happy and showed no abnormality. Unexpectedly, Yuying returned to the hospital that night and died suddenly. It was not until 11 a.m. the next morning that Li Konglan, Li's niece, came to the hospital to give Yuying an injection. She knocked hard on the door and called out, but there was no response. After Lu Zhenqing, the hospital's office manager, took the key to open the door and enter the room, he discovered that Li Yuying had already died, and her body was cold. After discovering Li Yuying's sudden death, the hospital authorities notified the family members to come, but did not report it to the police according to the regulations of the concession hospital. Instead, Lu Zhenqing, the hospital's office manager, ordered the hospital's doctor, Lin Zhengliang, to be responsible for issuing a death certificate stating that Li Yuying died of apoplexy (stroke), and notified the Haige Road Chinese Funeral Home to transport the body to the funeral home. Lu Zhenqing, on behalf of the family, took out a portion of the funds from the deceased's savings to purchase high-quality Western-style clothing and a coffin, placed the body in the coffin, and temporarily placed the coffin in the funeral home. While searching for a burial site in the Hongqiao Cemetery and planning to bury the body on a selected date, a person

named Lei Huayun sent letters to the French Police Department, the Special Second Court, and the Fujianese Association in Shanghai, recounting the unclear death of Li Yuying and requesting justice and a thorough investigation to redress the grievances of the deceased. After receiving the letter, the French Police Department sent investigators to the Sino-Western Sanatorium and the Chinese Funeral Home to investigate. Both claimed that the deceased died of a stroke and had no definite evidence. Further investigation of the deceased's family did not reveal the cause of Li Yuying's death. Therefore, the police ordered the coffin to be sent to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall Examination Office for examination. Yesterday morning, the deceased's parents, Li Shizhen and Li Linshi, the office manager of the Sino-Western Sanatorium, Lu Zhenqing, the doctor Lin Zhengliang, and the staff of the Chinese Funeral Home who handled the matter were summoned to the case. Zhao Changmin, the prosecutor appointed by the Prosecutor's Office of the Special Second Court, and the forensic medical officer, etc., arrived at the autopsy site to open the coffin and examine the body. Because the Fujianese Association in Shanghai received a report from Lei Huayun, it sent Xu Shaoshan, the director of public relations of the association, to the scene to observe the examination. The worker

opened the coffin lid and took out the body for examination. The body had undergone surgery at the funeral home and had been given an antiseptic injection. The face turned black, and the skin and flesh of the whole body were tight and hard. External examination did not reveal the exact cause of death. The prosecutor asked Lin Zhengliang, who replied that he was a doctor at the Sino-Western Sanatorium, and he did not know the truth about the death of the deceased. Lu Zhenqing ordered me to issue a death certificate stating that she died of a stroke. When questioned Lu Zhenqing, he also prevaricated and shifted the responsibility to the family of the deceased. The deceased's father, Li Shizhen, said that he did not know the cause of his daughter's death at the time, and everything was handled by Lu Zhenqing. The deceased's mother, Li Linshi, said that her daughter left 6,700 yuan in cash and jewelry, all of which were in the hospital, and requested that they be returned. When questioned Lu Zhenqing, he said that the deceased had 7,000 yuan in cash, three gold bracelets, and more than 200 pieces of clothing of various styles stored in the hospital. He originally wanted to return them to the family of the deceased. According to a report from the investigators, the certificate signed by Dr. Lin is currently in the Health Department. According to the family of the deceased, Lu Zhenqing even promised the family to continue to pay the deceased's salary of 300 yuan per month. There is also a written request drafted by Lu Zhenqing for the family to ask the hospital to waive the autopsy, which is now in the hospital, etc. Zhao the prosecutor and the forensic doctor checked the confession and reprimanded Lu Lin for

concealing the sudden death of the person without reporting it to the police and for issuing a certificate randomly to the funeral home for burial. It was also suspected that the death of the deceased was suspicious and required a detailed investigation to make it clear and prevent any injustice. Therefore, the case was left for the police department to continue the investigation before further verification, or the body would be dissected for examination. Lu Zhenqing and Lin Zhengliang were suspected of being heavily responsible and were taken back to the police station by the investigators for investigation. The coffin will still be temporarily stored at the autopsy site, or it may need to be dissected for examination.

### American Davis Robbed in Hongkou, Stops Rickshaw Puller, Robbed of 180 Yuan

The Continental Daily reported that an American, Davis, was robbed of 180 yuan in cash by eight bandits when he was traveling by rickshaw on Youheng Road early yesterday morning (the 24th). According to Davis's report to the Jiaxing Road Police Station, he was riding in a rickshaw on Youheng Road outside the boundary of the Public Concession at about 12:45 a.m. Bandits suddenly rushed out from the dark. Two of them stopped the rickshaw puller, and the rest grabbed Davis's arms on both sides of the rickshaw. Without saying a word, they immediately searched and robbed him, and quietly fled after robbing his money bag. Davis immediately shouted loudly to alert the police, but the "Avenue" police could not find any trace of them, so he went to the Jiaxing Road Police Station to report. However, it is not known what accent the bandits spoke, so it is not easy for the police to start the investigation.

### A Certain Party Establishes a "Relief Association" to Manage Shanghai West Gambling Dens, the Property of Each Gambling Den Belongs to the "Association"

According to information obtained by the Shewen News Agency reporter, there is a very big reason for this, which is that a certain party reached an agreement with the gambling table owners to form a "Relief Association." It was agreed that half of the income and surplus of each gambling den would be used to fund the "Association," and that all the privately owned properties of each gambling den would be transferred to the "Association" for management as "Association" property. The "Association" would send "staff" to be stationed in each gambling den to audit all expenses and supervise everything. At that time, the gambling dens fully recognized the above conditions, partly because they could still make profits, and partly because they were surrounded by dozens of staff members who came up with ideas. They also slightly modified the current situation of each gambling den. It is reported that Hollywood reopened yesterday, and several other gambling dens such as Monte Carlo will also reorganize in the next few days.

### The Female Boss of Huanlong Bathhouse Was Lured and Sold into Prostitution, Tricked of Huge Sums of Money and Defiled, Rogue Liang Lianqiao Punished and Fined

Mao Shoushan, a native of Danyang, has been running the Huanlong Bathhouse at No. 122 Huanlong Road in the French Concession. His business has been thriving recently, and he has accumulated a lot of wealth. His wife, Zhu, named Fengying, is 23 years old this year and has some beauty. She has been cohabiting with Mao. In April of this year, Zhu suddenly met Liang Lianqiao, a rogue from Jiangbei. They went to the Zhejiang Grand Theatre to watch a movie together. At that time, Liang learned that her family was wealthy, so he used his

silver tongue to lie that he had a steel factory in Tianjin with huge capital, and incited her to abandon her husband and run away with him to Tianjin to live a good life. Zhu was so bewitched by his sweet words that she not only had illicit relations with Liang at the Qinghe Hotel on Zhejiang Road that night, but also eloped with Liang on May 14, taking away her clothes and 5,000 yuan in cash. They met Liang at the Hu Ning Hotel on Jie Road and took the train to Tianjin together. They lived together at the Tianjin Hotel in Beikou for three days. Liang used his tricks to get all of Zhu's cash

, and sold her to Liu Shizhen's brothel in Shunde Li for 700 yuan to work as a prostitute. Liang took the money and returned to Shanghai, living comfortably in room 529 of the Oriental Hotel. Unexpectedly, the matter was discovered by the detectives of the Xinzha Police Station, who arrested Liang at the Oriental Hotel, seized 2,000 yuan in cash and a 1,000 yuan fixed deposit certificate from the Shanghai Bank, and took him to the police station. Yesterday morning, they sent Liang Lianqiao to the First Special Court Criminal Second Court along with Mao Shoushan, the husband of the victim. Zhang Tianyin, the lawyer of the police station,

filed a lawsuit according to law and detailed the above situation. According to Mao Shoushan's complaint, his wife recently borrowed 500 yuan from me on the pretext of her brother's wedding, and I gave her 5,000 yuan in legal currency to bring back because the price of farmland in the countryside was cheap. Unexpectedly, she eloped with someone. When Liang was questioned, he confessed everything. Judge Fu sentenced Liang to three years in prison for intending to lure women for profit, and fined him 500 yuan. If the fine is converted into labor service, it will be calculated at two yuan a day. A total of 3,000 yuan in legal currency and deposits seized will be returned to the original owner to receive it.

### High Tide and Heavy Rain, Water Overflowing Roads, Related to Sewer Blockage

Although yesterday was still the high tide period after the full moon in the lunar calendar, the predicted quantity by the Dredging Bureau was only a little more than ten feet. However, at 2:30 p.m. yesterday, the actual quantity was above eleven feet. Coupled with the torrential rain, the sewers could not discharge the water in time, and the low-lying roads were flooded into canals. The deepest areas were in front of the Sincere Company on Nanjing Road, and the side of the company on Zhejiang Road, the side of Wing On Company at the south entrance of Nanjing Road, in front of the Times Theatre on Er Ma Road in Daxin Street, the north and south ends of Guangxi Road on Nanjing Road, Yinghua Street on Nanjing Road, the intersection of Jiujiang Road and Sichuan Road, the intersection of Hankou Road and Sichuan Road, the intersection of Alabashito Road and Gansu Road, the intersection of Fuxu Road and Chengdu Road, Sapo Sai Road, and the Bund, etc. The water accumulated to a foot deep in some places, and several inches deep in others, forming a watery world. The combination of high tide and heavy rain yesterday was the biggest reason for the road flooding. Secondly, the road could not discharge the water in time. However, the reason why the road cannot discharge the water in time is also related to the sewer blockage. The recent road flooding in Shanghai is always related to rain, and the recession is very slow, which can be clearly understood, which is not purely caused by the tide flowing backwards from the sewer.

### Tuition Fee Dispute, Lawsuit Withdrawn

Because the students of Zhendong Primary School, Liu Fengying and Yunying, owed 21 yuan in tuition fees, the principal of the school, Fan Shenxiong, filed a lawsuit with the Special Second Court against the parents of the students, Liu Shusheng, to recover the fees. After the news was first revealed by a reporter from Shewen News Agency, it caused a sensation in society for a while, and many people expressed sympathy. It is now known that the case was originally scheduled for a continued hearing yesterday afternoon, but because the two parties had already reached a settlement outside of court, neither the plaintiff nor the defendant appeared in court yesterday. Only the principal of Zhendong, Fan Shenxiong, submitted a statement to the court, applying for withdrawal of the case. After receiving the statement, the court has approved the withdrawal.

### Japanese Oil Tanker Lost Control in Huangpu River, Zhaofeng Road Also Caught Fire

The English Da Mei Evening News reported that at 11:50 a.m. today (the 25th), an oil tanker for Japanese military use, berthed in front of the Mitsui Bussan Kaisha Wharf in Zhoujiazui, Pudong, loaded with oil and paint, suddenly lost control. The oil was flammable and quickly spread. Fortunately, the customs fire boat Puji arrived after hearing the alarm and used fourteen water hoses to pour water to extinguish the fire. Therefore, the fire was controlled within fifteen minutes and did not spread. The cause of the fire is unknown. It is believed that it was caused by carelessly throwing a match or cigarette butt. Also, at 12:10 p.m. today, a box of lump carbolic acid in the Rongsheng Pharmacy at No. 62 Zhaofeng Road exploded due to the heat of the coal stove. The interior of the house was damaged, but fortunately, no one was injured. There was a small fire at the time, which was quickly extinguished.

At 1:35 p.m. yesterday, a pedestrian, Hua Jinfeng (28 years old), was walking alone between Yuyuan Road and Yidingpan Road in Shanghai West when suddenly a bullet flew and hit him on the leg. He was injured and fell to the ground immediately. After the patrolman discovered it, he sent him to Renji Hospital for treatment. After the incident, the police investigated the origin of the bullet and found that it was a British soldier who was cleaning his gun when it misfired. It is said that the British authorities intend to punish the soldier who caused the accident.

### Robbery of Xiang Sheng Car

At 6:50 a.m. yesterday, five customers at the general station of the Xiang Sheng Automobile Company on Beijing Road hired a car. The company sent driver Zhang Jinmei to drive a car numbered 18589 to respond. The driver then drove to Dunxin Road, Kaixuan Road in Shanghai West according to the customer's instructions in the car. When they arrived at that location, one of the passengers in the car suddenly pulled out a pistol and ordered the driver to stop. One person took the driver out of the car and escorted him to a small house in a small alley on the side of the road to monitor his actions. The rest of the bandits, seeing that everything was settled, drove the car away and disappeared. After about two hours, the driver was released and reported the incident to the Jing'an Temple Road Police Station. The lost car was also found by the Haifang Road. The police are investigating what the bandits did by robbing the car.

### The Hardware Industry in This City Has the Most Developed Business, New Shun Tai Has the Highest Profit

### Letter

To the Editor:
We are writing in response to the news item published on June 24 in the "Local News" section of your newspaper, concerning the "Da Fang Hotel's Occupation of Refugee Donations." The item states that the hotel industry has been collecting refugee donations from guests, but due to certain relationships, it has always allowed guests to donate voluntarily. To prevent malfeasance, it has been stated that any surplus amount remaining after settlement with the refugee association would be donated to other charities. This is not in accordance with the facts. This association has always collected refugee expenses from the hotel industry in accordance with the regulations, and has always collected and paid them in full. The Da Fang Hotel cannot be an exception. If the funds collected in the name of this association could be used freely by the collector, the malfeasance would be unimaginable. This letter is to request a correction in order to clarify the truth.
Sincerely,
Yuan Ludeng, Secretary General, Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, June 24

### Bai Ge Piao (Pigeon Lottery)

Luzon is located in a remote part of the South Seas, a sparse collection of islands. The land is barren, the people are poor, and there are no local products to speak of. In terms of trade volume and the movement of goods by ship, it is like a small witch in the presence of a great wizard compared to other countries. However, its circulating Bai Ge Piao generates huge profits every month. Those involved in selling them say that the method is extremely fair. The drawings determine the winners and losers, with no private abuses. Moreover, all of this is done by the monarch himself, never delegated to others. Therefore, people everywhere win big prizes, but the people in that country are less likely to win, because the country has many poor people, making it difficult to afford tickets, and because the country is poor, there are few buyers. The surplus silver is used to support the widowed, orphaned, and lonely, making it a good law that uses wealth wisely, which is why it can last. Moreover, it can be expanded and extended. A few years ago, there were only 10,000 lottery numbers. Because there were not enough to sell, the number was increased to 12,000, and recently it has been increased to 13,000. In Shanghai alone, there are five sellers. In the past, people suspected that they were acting privately, but recently they have become deeply convinced and are competing to buy them. Initially, Westerners living there sold hundreds of tickets per month, but now Chinese people also sell hundreds of tickets. Those with more money buy the entire number, and those with less money buy half a ticket, or about several people buy it together, so more people win prizes. There are ten small lotteries and two large lotteries throughout the year. For the small lotteries, each ticket costs six yuan, and for the large lotteries, it costs twice as much. In Luzon, it only costs five or ten yuan, but in Shanghai, the ticket is marked up to cover water freight and the profits of the handler, so it is slightly more expensive.

War

### Concerning the Fifth Column

— Shi Tao

"Fifth Column," "Fifth Column," people all over the world are shuddering at this new term. Whether in Europe, Asia, or the Americas, whether in the belligerent or non-belligerent countries of the European war, this new type of spy army is lurking. England, France, Turkey, and other countries, in order to prevent its clandestine activities, have arrested many nationals and non-nationals. Even the United States, far across the ocean, has felt its terror and allocated $175,000 for the expenses of searching for the Fifth Column.

As early as five years ago, in 1936, when the Spanish revolutionary rebels advanced on Madrid, General Mola of Franco's headquarters announced: "Our army now has four columns of troops outside the city of Madrid, and there is also a Fifth Column lurking in the city. Madrid will be opened from within by their hands, so the capital will undoubtedly fall into our army's hands!"

This can be said to be the origin of the term "Fifth Column." During this European war, Germany used the Fifth Column to disrupt the enemy's internal affairs and collect enemy intelligence, etc., and achieved great success. This invisible spy army not only makes the enemy helpless, but also seems to disturb the peace of mind of the world. However, what kind of organization is the so-called Fifth Column after all? In short, the Fifth Column is the most elite spy army trained by Germany for this European war. It is, of course, under the command of Himmler, the head of the secret police. The number of people, tens of thousands, is naturally unknown. They all have to obey iron-like rules and accept instructions from the headquarters, adapting to circumstances in order to achieve the greatest effect, so the matter of "life" must be put aside. Among them are men, women, old, and young. In short, each is assigned the most appropriate job according to the difference in their origin and education.

Let's take an example. When Germany invaded Poland last year, on September 8, the Polish stronghold of R府市 was bombed by a large number of German aircraft. One of the planes was shot down by Polish fire, and two pilots were captured by the Polish army. Under interrogation, both were very young officers. Two years ago, these two had stayed in R府市 as students, and the leader of the two belonged to was also living in R府市 for a long time, engaged in commerce.

For example, during the invasion of the Netherlands, this group of Fifth Column personnel preemptively destroyed canals and bridges to hinder the Dutch military operations. They set fires in the enemy's gasoline storage depots, airfields, and shipyards, spread rumors, and disturbed people's minds, etc. These were all their methods of warfare.

The Fifth Column is not only made up of Germans, but also many powerful pro-German foreigners. With their power, they form even stronger organizations, scattered like cells in the country, carrying out activities. The success of the annexation of Austria by Germany is the best example. Even in countries that have not participated in the war, the activities of the Fifth Column are also extremely fierce. The Iron Guard in Romania implicitly opposed the King, first assassinating Prime Minister 加利南士哥, and then plotting to oppose the King. Recently, the King of Romania finally softened and had to ask to compromise with the group.

In this war, the German army has tried its best to propagate to France that Germany only hates Britain and has no reason to fight France, but the activity of the Fifth Column in France is really very harmful. President 某决勒幼仑 inspected the Alsace war line in great secrecy, and the German troops in front immediately raised a flag saying "Welcome to His Excellency the President of France," and the German broadcaster played "La Marseillaise." More interesting than this incident was when British Prime Minister Churchill and Eden inspected the French army and had lunch in Lille. This was of course a very secret matter, but when the two were seated, the radio on the table rang.

"This is the Berlin radio station. Now France is holding a luncheon for Ministers Churchill and Eden in Lille. Let me tell you the menu..."

Then, in fluent English, he accurately reported the current menu of the two ministers, without a single error. In France, no matter how big or small, Germany seems to be able to see everything at a glance, so it is no wonder that the impregnable Maginot Line was broken through by Germany.

The Fifth Column is simply ubiquitous and uses every trick. Whatever people can think of, it has already done it. Now that France has surrendered, this new type of "spy army" will overcome all obstacles and attack England and the Balkan countries!

### Facts Speak Louder Than Words

— Lin Zhonghao

The progress of science, the development of transportation routes, and the prosperity of commerce have already made the countries of the world have an inextricably complex relationship. Therefore, it is impossible for a country to adopt an isolated and detached attitude and want to break away from the world and not be affected by world affairs.

When the Sino-Japanese war broke out, in addition to expressing great admiration and admiration for China's determination and perseverance in resisting the war, many foreigners were skeptical about the sentence "China is fighting for the safety of the world." Some even thought that it was purely a propaganda slogan for China to ask for foreign aid.

However, after the outbreak of the European war, facts finally speak louder than words. The Anglo-French allied forces suffered repeated defeats, and France even humiliatingly sought peace, almost without time to take care of the Far East. If China had not continued to resist bravely here, how the power of Britain and France in the Far East would have been devastated and hit, no one dared to predict.

"China is fighting for the world!" This is not an exaggeration, but a true fact!

Facts speak louder than words!

### This is How a Person Should Be

— Written by Mead, Translated by Ku Kou

Respect my country, my profession, and myself. Treat my friends with honesty and justice, just as I want them to treat me with honesty and justice. Be a loyal citizen, praise my country, and do nothing to damage its reputation. Be a person whose reputation follows his name.

Base the hope of reward on service. Exchange success for honest effort. Always take work as an opportunity, happily seize it, and make the most of it. Do not regard it as a painful, reluctant, and forced servitude.

Remember that success lies in myself, in my own brainpower, in my own ambition, in my own courage and determination. When encountering difficulties, fight against them. Take the experience of hardship and difficulty as information for future work.

Be devoted to my profession. Make everyone I see optimistic. Dispel anger with happiness, eliminate suspicion with certainty, and reduce friction with people with an easygoing personality.

Study my business carefully. Know the various aspects of my profession in detail. Use both brain and strength, work systematically, and have a method. Do what must be done when I have free time, and do not waste time. Save time as a miser saves money. Make every hour generate interest, whether it is the increase of knowledge or the cultivation of body and mind.

Make my future not be burdened by debt. Earn money and save money. Give up all expensive entertainment until I can afford it. Abandon promiscuity, maintain the health of my body and the peace of mind, just like maintaining valuable inventory in trade.

Finally, hold on to the joy of life. Be a decent man in a bright and upright manner. Overcome my own weaknesses and strive to become a strong and superior person.

Then I can be courteous to others, loyal to friends, and have a clear conscience before heaven.

Entertainment Circle

### Kunming Film Industry Overview

— Qian

(Kunming Airlines News) A year ago, in the summer, I arrived in Kunming, as if I had walked into a desert. When friends met, the methods to find entertainment in spirit were nothing more than playing chess, or trying their luck, acting on the spot, and playing mahjong to pass the time.

This is the same as the situation in the American West during its development. Now, this city is becoming more and more prosperous day by day! In the southern district of Kunming, among many beautiful buildings, a giant theater has emerged, which is the Nanping Grand Theater. It meets all reasonable requirements, has the beauty of both classic and modern times, is solemn and magnificent, and more valuable, the projection machine is a "Peacock Brand" automatic and complete instrument, for a blockbuster, it delicately and accurately shows it to the audience; until now, it has introduced a first-class blockbuster to the people of Kunming. This is:

Wings Over the World (Paramount). Stooges Go West (MGM). Bitter Sweet (United Artists). Virginia City (Warner Bros.). The Cowboy and the Lady (United Artists). The Oppenheim Family (Soviet Union). The Firefly (United Artists). If I Were King (Paramount). Little Lord Fauntleroy (United Artists). Camille (United Artists).

On the day of its birth on April 2nd of this year, facing the Nanping Grand Theater from afar, a music hall was being built, which was the prototype of the New Dayi Amusement Cinema. It was established with an investment of 300,000 yuan, because its shareholders are part of the shareholders of the Nanping Theater. In the Kunming film industry, they are sister theaters. In addition to the sisters, there are also a pair of old brothers, called the Dazhong Cinema and the Old Dayi Amusement Cinema. The perfection of the equipment and the strictness of the film selection are not worth mentioning. Their business policy is to entertain the audience with low-cost tickets. This may be unique here. During the screening, staff members tell the story of the play and the lines on the stage. Most of the Kunming audience believes that explaining the plot can increase the interest in watching the play.

The number of times that domestic films are shown here is very small. - Mysterious Flower, Isolated Island Paradise, and Northern Battlefield Loyal Record are like a flash in the pan. Recently, China Film Corporation shot the exterior scenes of "Thousands of Miles in the Air" in Kunming, and also brought many excellent actors, which made everyone pay attention to domestic films. I very much hope that the Shanghai film company will jointly set up a joint office in Kunming to introduce domestic films to the audience in the mainland as much as possible.

The development of Kunming's film industry proves that this city is progressing, at least it is no longer a desert! (Sent on June 15th)

### Spoken Drama Su Wu Shepherding

— Zou Xiao

It is said that the United Arts Experimental Troupe and the professional troupe of Chu Xinxing are organized by ambitious young people, which is very admirable. This performance of Wang Jixu's creation "Su Wu Shepherding" is still the first public performance.

This play is mostly in line with historical facts, that is, Su Wu's son Tong Guo is also in the official history. Han Shu Volume 54 Su Jianzi Wu Biography Yun: "When Wu was old, his son died before he was seated. The emperor felt sorry for him; he asked the people around him whether Wu had a son in the Xiongnu? Wu Bai Bai Yin Ping Enhou himself said that when he sent the Xiongnu, a son Tong Guo was born to the Hu woman. There were voices asking to use the envoy to send gold and silk to redeem him. The emperor allowed it. Later, Tong Guo followed the envoy, and the emperor thought he was a Lang. It's just that I didn't mention whether the Hu woman would return home with him. Lake Baikal is Lake Baihaer. Historical Records Note Yun: "The North Sea is the northern border of the Xiongnu, and now it is Lake Baihaer."

Guo Moruo once wrote several poems in "Electric Light and Flint," one of which was Su Wu Shepherding. Now this spoken drama is also a beautiful long poem. Because of the design of Hu Xuguang, Ling Lei, etc., and the director of Wu Yonggang, etc., each scene has many beautiful pictures, and the position of the characters is also very beautiful. Although it is just a piece of white cloth covering the mountain, and two real sheep are tied to the fence, it is very much like a snowy and icy world; the costumes are also completely different from Peking Opera and Kunqu Opera, purely Han Dynasty clothing, I think Ma Lianliang may also refer to it. As for the actors, Tie Nuo's Su Wu is the most successful. Xiao Qing's Tong Guo is also very cute, but the word "Jiang" in surrender should be read in the first tone, but it was mistakenly read in the fourth tone.

It is unexpected that such a calm subject matter can be performed actively and lively, from beginning to end, and the audience does not feel tired.

Tong Guo recognizes the words on the sand, and Su Wu gives his son the wind hat before returning home. These are all very poetic. The play writes about the loyalty and bravery of Su Wu and Chang Hui, which is contrasted with Wei Lu and Zhang Sheng, etc., which is the main theme of the play. The success of this point has been confirmed by the popularity of the box office in recent days.

Ouyang Yuqian is rehearsing "Mulan Joins the Army," "Victory Year," "The Peach Blossom Fan," "Peach Blossom Face," and "Rebellion" in Guilin, which are selling very well.

Tian Ao completed the entire script of "Yue Fei" last month, with a total length of 50,000 words, which was published in the Changsha National Daily.

### Impressions of "The Net of Heaven and Earth"

— Shen Qi

The performance of "The Net of Heaven and Earth," although containing a kind of preaching meaning of "cause and effect" retribution, forcefully emphasizes a kind of psychological punishment and satirizes the irregular life of general collapsing strata.

Reviewing the play "The Net of Heaven and Earth," the progress of the story is very simple, explaining that after a person commits a crime, it is equivalent to owing a debt to society. Even if it is suspended or even avoided, it must be repaid in the end. The structure of the whole play is tense and exciting, with many climaxes surging in the five acts and eleven scenes. The murder of Mei Jieying by Ma Yuchuan in the second act, and the departure of Na Ru and the suicide of A Nan in the fourth act, etc., can all suppress the audience's emotions. The satire is also very strong.

As for the performance, Zhou Chu's Ma Jinchuan is the most important and the most successful in the whole play. The inner conflict of love and hate is fully displayed, especially in the movements, he can always enhance the terrifying scene, and the tone and tone are also enough to show a kind of, sick, and frivolous personality, which is also in line with his identity. A Nan is a sincere and simple person with the image of a good wife and mother in the play. Zhang Xuemei's performance is very vivid. Qiu Quan's Hai Meng and Lan Qing's Mrs. Grant are very competent, using fluent spoken language to set off their expressions. The rest, Mei Jieying of the Yellow River, and the doctor of Shao Hua, although they appear less, they have worked hard in drama and art.

Finally, after watching the whole play, I feel that we don't have to hate people, let alone hate criminals. What we hate is the social system. At the same time, we should work hard to reform the old system and create a new world!

### Thoughts After Watching "Yang Paifeng"

— Lu Yuan Scholar

Shi Shan has performed the play "Yang Paifeng" (originally named "Fire Stick Performance") at the Renewal Stage for five or six times. Every performance is full, which shows his appeal. I was able to take the time to watch it the other night. The whole play is full and impeccable, and it is indeed a good structure. The reputation is by no means accidental. In short, Shi Shan's art can be summarized by the four words of vigorous and steady. As for the beauty of his posture and the lightness of his style, what is called flying like a startled goose and swimming like a dragon is especially superfluous.

According to this play, it should be simply called "Four Fights." There are many examples in dramas such as the Three Visits, Three Searches, and Three Slashes, and there is also a play called "Three Fights" in front (Yao Gang fights Wang Ying), so it is even more possible to name it "Four Fights." After watching, I wrote two poems:

After Qinglong fights, he fights Jiao Meng, internal strength succeeds in resisting foreign countries; the fire girl has many war achievements, and even sees Han Chang fighting in battle.

I only see the hand spinning like a wheel, the head-on blow is like waving a whip; the Hu children are strong and useless, kneeling before the heroine of Shenzhou.

### New Lineups of the Two Drama Circles (Below)

— Only Me

Clown Ci Ruiquan, is a senior clown, and is also a typical figure in the Liyuan today. He has been paired with the Tan family for generations. His qualifications, experience, reputation, and status are similar to Xiao Changhua. Due to his age, he has not been here for a long time. (Old Ci is a basic figure in the Cheng Yanqiu and Tan Fuying classes, but in the past Yanqiu came south, Old Ci did not follow him, and his son Shaoquan acted as a substitute, that is, when Fuying came to Shanghai last time, he also changed to invite Ru Fuhui because Old Ci was unwilling to suffer from the boat). This time, he resolutely went south, and we were able to see the typical figure of the senior, which can be said to be a great blessing. There is also Luo Wenkui, a famous clown in the north. Shanghai people are not very familiar with him, so it is necessary to introduce him: This person is the son of the old actor Luo Baisui. He has a family background and his art is quite extraordinary. Unfortunately, he was not met when he was young. In recent years, he has been teaching students in Ping, and he has never been in class. He has been quite frustrated. This time, he can be invited by Fuying, which can be said to be a Maxima meeting Bole. Wu Xing Zhang Lianting, is invited by Yang Shengchun's helper. According to Shengchun's helper, Han Shengxin was originally Shengchun's helper. This time Shengchun came south without inviting Shengxin, but invited Lianting, (according to Zhang Lianting is Gao Shenglin's helper) is also a strange thing. Hua Dan Ji Yanfen, originally named Xiao Guihua, is a disciple of Binqing Society, and is a teacher brother with Gu Yulan of the current Renewal Stage, (according to Gu Yulan's original name is Yulan Hua) was very popular in the early years, but now he is old and fading. The old Sheng Ha Baoshan, is a rising star. His art is no less than that of the predecessor Zhang Chunyan, and he is also a rich old partner. Song Jiting is also commendable. Looking at the supporting roles invited by Fuying this time, we can call them "a gathering of talents." What can be described even more is that many of the supporting roles here are relatives of the Tan family, such as Yang Shengchun is Fuying's sister Qian, Jiang Miaoxiang is Taiying's Taishan, Tan Shiying is Fuying's brother, and Song Jiting is Fuying's brother-in-law, etc. (Fuying's ex-wife is the Song family) This can also be said to be that internal promotion does not avoid relatives, and their performances are often more like a raging fire. One laugh.

Latest news: Regarding the Tan Troupe invited by the Renewal Stage, there are slight changes in the personnel. The painted face Ma Liankun did not reach an agreement due to official business issues and has stopped coming south. The old actor Ci Ruiquan decided to accompany Tan. In addition, there is one thing that the reporter did not expect, that is, Wu Sheng Yang Shengchun's target Han Shengxin decided to come with Shengchun, and Zhang Lianting was also on the list of invitees. It is also learned that Tan Fuying will come to Shanghai to perform the play "Silang Visits His Mother". The Tan Troupe has re-invited the old Dan He Shengqing (Fucheng Fourth Branch has two old Dan talents, one is Li Shengquan and the other is He Shengqing) to join, adding to the strength. The strength of this group of people in the Renewal Stage has become more and more strong.
